And while he built that relationship genuinely off a connection, he was also using that relationship to bolster his reputation with the free folk and fit in. It was all ultimately to gain info and attempt to kill Mance, and when the time was right he left the girl he loved, betrayed her, and went back to his duty, his brothers. </p><p>Jon has seen Dany do great things with her dragons - namely save him lol. He\u2019s not seen the worst, but he has certainly imagined it and surmised what she\u2019s done. </p><p>I think he wants to believe she has a good heart and will be a good ruler - better than Cersei. When she saves him, I think he gets caught up in that person &amp; in the damsel in distress bit. She\u2019s strong but now she\u2019s crying and sad bc she lost a child. Jon likes being needed and he likes helping. </p><p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched for Jon to realize that having an emotional, romantic connection to Dany is going to help him politically, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched to imagine him betraying or leaving her for his true goal: to serve the North. </p><p>Ultimately I think this hits home with a huge reason why I don\u2019t think Dany and Jon can be endgame. They have completely different goals. Dany wants to take the throne in KL and rule all seven kingdoms and some. She has no family. She only wants power and the seat that she believes is rightfully hers. Jon wants to protect his family. He belongs in the North. He doesn\u2019t seek out power, and he definitely doesn\u2019t think his birthright gives him anything. </p><p>Dany will want to be in the South in KL.

But they were coming and there was no one to stop them.</p><p>No one but them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Jon took a deep breath and stood up from his seat. He straightened his back and lifted his chin. He still wasn\u2019t used to being king, but he had watched Ned and hoped that looking as much like him as possible would be enough. \u201cThe white walkers are marching upon us and we are all that stands between them and Westeros.\u201d He spoke slowly. \u201cRight now it\u2019s not about who will end up on the iron throne. It\u2019s simply about who will survive.\u201d </p><p>There was nothing but absolute silence, but when he looked at Sansa, sitting firmly on his right, she nodded. </p><p>\u201cTonight love your husbands, love your wives and kiss your children goodnight. Tomorrow we\u2019ll show the death what we\u2019re made of.\u201d </p><p>The crowd in front of him started cheering and Jon felt the adrenaline rushing through his veins. Maybe he wasn\u2019t used to being a king, but he was used to fight and to command an army. He could do this. He would do this.</p><p>\u201cWinter is coming, but the North will endure!\u201d Jon raised his voice. \u201cFor Winterfell!\u201d He let his glance wander over all the people who had pledged their loyalty to him while they left the great hall to enjoy their possible last day on earth. </p><!-- more --><p>And only when there was nothing but utter silence and he and Sansa were the only ones left he fell down in his seat and allowed the weight of the upcoming war to crush him. </p><p>\u201cJon\u2026\u201d Sansa placed a hand on his. Her touch was gentle and light and her voice was soothing. \u201cYou should take your own advice and spend time with the people you love tonight, saying goodbye.\u201d She almost choked on the last word and Jon\u2019s hand went through his dark black curls. </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He\u2019d have to say goodbye to Sam, to Bran, to Arya. He\u2019d have to say goodbye to Sansa. He\u2019d have to say much more to Sansa. It could be his very last chance. Maybe he would die tomorrow, or next week, or somewhere in between. Maybe he could never tell her anymore.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know where to start. He had never been much of a talker, not when it came to his wishes, longings and feelings. He had never been much of a talker when it came to love.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa was the first to break the silence. \u201cI know that I wasn\u2019t always nice to you when we were kids.\u201d Her lips curled up into a sad smile. \u201cBut you\u2019re an amazing king. Father, Robb\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cThey would be really proud of you and how far you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the girl next to him, speaking as if they were not children simply pretending to be kings and queens. \u201cIt will all be pointless if we lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa firmly shook her head and she tightened her grip on his hand, which she was still holding. \u201cThe last years have been hard, yes, but there have been nice moments too.\u201d Her smile brightened. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I was here to see you become the amazing leader you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you, Sansa.\u201d </p><p>Without her he would have been dead. He wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to march on Winterfell. He would have lost the battle against Ramsay. He wouldn\u2019t have won the trust of the North. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell everyone about the true war that was coming. </p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d He added and swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been beautiful, but I hope that by now you know that you\u2019re so much more than that. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019re brave. You\u2019re strong.\u201d He treaded on dangerous ground, but he realised he had not much to lose. \u201cAnd if there had been more time, I would have asked you if there was maybe a part of you that could love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO, Jon\u2026\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh and then she pressed the palms of her hands to his cheeks. \u201cThere is not a part of me that doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d She locked her glance with his and then she leaned in to kiss him. </p><p>At first her kiss was soft and tender, but then he wrapped his arms around her and parted his lips. </p><p>They forgot where they were. They forgot who they were. They forgot the time.</p><p>And minutes, or hours, later, when they were both out of breath and their lips were red and swollen they pulled back and realised that every second that passed was one more second closer to what could be the end.</p><p>\u201cLet me go with you.\u201d Sansa bit her lip. \u201cI know I can\u2019t fight as well as you or Arya. But I can\u2019t stand the thought of staying behind, not knowing who will come knocking on my door. You or the army of the death.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cAnd if these are our last days on earth, I want to spend them with you.\u201d</p><p>And despite the war that was coming, despite death waiting for them around the corner, despite the lack of promises if there would ever be a tomorrow, Jon felt himself smiling. \u201cI won\u2019t leave your side until the last bit of air leaves my body. It doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s tomorrow, next week or in a hundred years.\u201d He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI&rsquo;m gonna spend the rest of my life with you, starting with tonight.\u201d He stood up from his seat and stretched out his hand.</p><p>With a smile Sansa placed her hand in his and a small scream escaped her lips when he lifted her up and carried her towards her bedroom.</p>",

He\u2019d have to say goodbye to Sansa. He\u2019d have to say much more to Sansa. It could be his very last chance. Maybe he would die tomorrow, or next week, or somewhere in between. Maybe he could never tell her anymore.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t know where to start. He had never been much of a talker, not when it came to his wishes, longings and feelings. He had never been much of a talker when it came to love.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Sansa was the first to break the silence. \u201cI know that I wasn\u2019t always nice to you when we were kids.\u201d Her lips curled up into a sad smile. \u201cBut you\u2019re an amazing king. Father, Robb\u2026\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cThey would be really proud of you and how far you\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the girl next to him, speaking as if they were not children simply pretending to be kings and queens. \u201cIt will all be pointless if we lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t.\u201d Sansa firmly shook her head and she tightened her grip on his hand, which she was still holding. \u201cThe last years have been hard, yes, but there have been nice moments too.\u201d Her smile brightened. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I was here to see you become the amazing leader you are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without you, Sansa.\u201d </p><p>Without her he would have been dead. He wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to march on Winterfell. He would have lost the battle against Ramsay. He wouldn\u2019t have won the trust of the North. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell everyone about the true war that was coming. </p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d He added and swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been beautiful, but I hope that by now you know that you\u2019re so much more than that. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019re brave. You\u2019re strong.\u201d He treaded on dangerous ground, but he realised he had not much to lose. \u201cAnd if there had been more time, I would have asked you if there was maybe a part of you that could love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO, Jon\u2026\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh and then she pressed the palms of her hands to his cheeks. \u201cThere is not a part of me that doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d She locked her glance with his and then she leaned in to kiss him. </p><p>At first her kiss was soft and tender, but then he wrapped his arms around her and parted his lips. </p><p>They forgot where they were. They forgot who they were. They forgot the time.</p><p>And minutes, or hours, later, when they were both out of breath and their lips were red and swollen they pulled back and realised that every second that passed was one more second closer to what could be the end.</p><p>\u201cLet me go with you.\u201d Sansa bit her lip. \u201cI know I can\u2019t fight as well as you or Arya. But I can\u2019t stand the thought of staying behind, not knowing who will come knocking on my door. You or the army of the death.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cAnd if these are our last days on earth, I want to spend them with you.\u201d</p><p>And despite the war that was coming, despite death waiting for them around the corner, despite the lack of promises if there would ever be a tomorrow, Jon felt himself smiling. \u201cI won\u2019t leave your side until the last bit of air leaves my body. It doesn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s tomorrow, next week or in a hundred years.\u201d He tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my life with you, starting with tonight.\u201d He stood up from his seat and stretched out his hand.</p><p>With a smile Sansa placed her hand in his and a small scream escaped her lips when he lifted her up and carried her towards her bedroom.</p></p>",

He didn&rsquo;t know how and he didn&rsquo;t know why, but he felt it. He felt it in his bones. He felt it in his soul. He felt it in his heart.<br /></p>\n<p>They were coming.</p>\n<p>The army of the death was coming.</p>\n<p>They could be here tomorrow. They could be here in a few days or a week.

He straightened his back and lifted his chin. He still wasn&rsquo;t used to being king, but he had watched Ned and hoped that looking as much like him as possible would be enough. &ldquo;The white walkers are marching upon us and we are all that stands between them and Westeros.&rdquo; He spoke slowly. &ldquo;Right now it&rsquo;s not about who will end up on the iron throne. It&rsquo;s simply about who will survive.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>There was nothing but absolute silence, but when he looked at Sansa, sitting firmly on his right, she nodded. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tonight love your husbands, love your wives and kiss your children goodnight. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll show the death what we&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>The crowd in front of him started cheering and Jon felt the adrenaline rushing through his veins. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t used to being a king, but he was used to fight and to command an army. He could do this. He would do this.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Winter is coming, but the North will endure!&rdquo; Jon raised his voice. &ldquo;For Winterfell!&rdquo; He let his glance wander over all the people who had pledged their loyalty to him while they left the great hall to enjoy their possible last day on earth. </p>\n</p>",
