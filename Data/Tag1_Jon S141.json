        "body": "<h1>Some Winterfell Dany Headcanons</h1><ul><li>Dany is in awe of the weather in Winterfell. She\u2019s seen snow north of the wall but that was different. There the wind blew harshly and the cold cut through the flesh and straight to the bone. Snow flew around making it hard to see or breathe or do much of anything. Winterfell was nothing like that when she arrived. It was bitterly cold but there was a softness to the weather. The snow fell in delicate flurries and rested soft and pillowy on the ground. That softness was reflected in Dany, the way her eyes glistened at the white landscape and the hint of a smile came to her lips.</li><li>Dany isn\u2019t used to the snow or ice. Her balance is off completely and she slips and stumbles in her first few steps. She has too much confidence in her movement and falls flat on her ass in a mound of snow. A horde of people swarmed around her with concern but she waved them all away. The only thing hurt was her pride. She was more careful from then on, falling on her face probably wouldn\u2019t be a very regal first impression. Every once and a while she would begin to slip and would subtly grab onto Jon\u2019s arm with an iron grip. </li><li>Dany doesn\u2019t deal very well with the cold. She prefers the warmth, always has. She\u2019s always close to a fire and sleeps with a pile of blankets the size of a mountain. She notices Missandei is also having a hard time with the cold. Dany notices her friend shivering and shaking. Despite her own coldness, Dany takes off her scarf and offers it to Missandei. Missandei refuses, of course, but Dany insists and wraps the scarf around her. </li><li>One day, on a walk through the grounds, a snowball comes flying through the air towards Dany. Everyone around her bristles protectively. Dany stands in shock as the cold snow melts and trickles down the neck of her coat. Who would dare throw snow at Daenerys Storborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, Rightful Heir to the Iron Throne, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of chains, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea? Arya Stark would. She stood across the courtyard smirking playfully. Everyone around looked on in slight terror of how Dany would retaliate. Well, everyone except Jon. Jon pressed a hand to his mouth and tried to hide his chuckles. Jon\u2019s laughter was enough to lighten Dany up. She knelt down and grabbed a fistful of snow. She tossed it in Arya\u2019s direction but Arya swiftly dodged out of the way. The snowball kept going and crashed straight against Lady Sansa. Sansa initially looked enraged and appalled. But the feelings quickly have way and she couldn\u2019t help but smile. Sansa has grown up playing in the cold north. Sansa returned the fire with a perfectly aimed snowball that crashed right against Dany\u2019s face. Jon couldn\u2019t  hide his laughter anymore and let out a loud chuckle. This drew all attention to him and both Arya and Dany has the same idea. Two snowballs went flying towards him, one hitting his precious hair. Everyone who passed by looked on in awe as some of the most important people in all of the seven kingdoms had a full on snowball fight.</li></ul>",

I told you how I think this can be inferred in the books, but while we still haven&rsquo;t got any explicit reference to that, there is at least one \u201csubdly explicit\u201d case that points straight to it. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense? Now I\u2019ll explain:</p><!-- more --><p><i><i>&ldquo;Then Ghost emerged from between two trees, with <b>Val beside him</b></i>. They look as though <b>they belong together</b>. Val was <b>clad in all white; white woolen breeches</b> tucked into high boots of bleached <b>white leather</b>, <b>white bearskin cloak </b>pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, <b>white tunic </b>with bone fastenings. <b>Her breath was white as well \u2026but her eyes were blue, her long braid the color of dark honey, her cheeks flushed red from the cold.</b> It had been <b>A LONG WHILE SINCE JON SNOW HAD SEEN A SIGHT SO LOVELY. &quot;Have you been trying to steal my wolf?\u201d</b> he asked her.\u201c</i> (ADWD, JON XI)</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9206a01c4db0ccc44300386720811ff/tumblr_inline_pl30ccOAJ21vseiju_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>A woman with DARK HONEY HAIR (which is a shade of auburn) and BLUE EYES, CLAD IN ALL WHITE, a WHITE BEARSKIN CLOAK on her shoulders, HER CHEEKS FLUSHED FROM THE COLD, walks with a WHITE GHOST at her side, a sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that Jon remembers seeing before.</p><p>This undoubtedly symbolizes a marriage: Val and Ghost appear to BELONG TOGETHER and she seems to want to STEAL HIM, which is another way to say CLOAK HIM, id est MARRY HIM, and she is in turn CLOACKED WITH A WHITE BEARSKIN.</p><p>Now, Jon refused Stannis offer to marry Val and become the Lord of Winterfell - because \u201c<i><b>Winterfell belongs to my sister Sansa\u201d - </b></i>so it kind of makes sense that GRRM wants to play a little with that. Only, isn\u2019t it a bit strange that we\u2019ve been told that Val has GREY EYES and BLONDE/LIGHT HONEY HAIR?\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"476\" data-orig-height=\"267\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce9ffbe61c36a82b98671c88ec2d276a/tumblr_inline_pl4l7xWSCb1vseiju_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"476\" data-orig-height=\"267\"/></figure><p>Why does Val appear like someone else here? Why does a scene that resembles a MARRIAGE look <b>SO LOVELY</b> to Jon? And what is that other sight he\u2019s comparing this one to?</p><p><i>Robb and his snow wet hair </i>helps us again to find it out. In fact, when Sansa is in the Vale, this happens:<br/></p><p><i>Snow was falling on the Eyrie. <b>Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory.</b> Was this what woke me? Already the snowfall lay thick upon the garden below, <b>blanketing the grass, dusting the shrubs and statues with white</b> and weighing down the branches of the trees. <b>The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago, in the long summer of her childhood. She had last seen snow the day she\u2019d left Winterfell. </b>That was a lighter fall than this, she remembered. <b>Robb had melting flakes in his hair </b>when he hugged me, and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in her hands. It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning\u2026 and <b>she\u2019d ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her..</b>. I<b> thought my song was beginning that day, but it was almost done\u2026 </b>She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift, and over that a warm dress of blue lambswool. Two pairs of hose for her legs, boots that laced up to her knees, heavy leather gloves, and finally <b>a hooded cloak of soft white fox fur\u2026\u00a0</b></i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0da998c04d019efb6ec3536b77c33f3f/tumblr_inline_pl30ctBJIM1vseiju_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p><i> <b>When she opened the door to the garden, IT WAS SO LOVELY THAT SHE HELD HER BREATH, UNWILLING TO DISTURB SUCH PERFECT BEAUTY.

It was a place of whites and blacks and greys\u2026 <b>A pure world, </b>Sansa thought. I do not belong here\u2026 <b>Sansa wondered if she were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover\u2019s kisses, and melted on her cheeks\u2026 </b>She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. <b>It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams\u2026</b> It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another day. Another new day. <b>It was the old days she hungered for.</b> Prayed for\u2026\u00a0<b>The snow fell and the castle rose.</b>..

She steps into a SNOW WHITE place enveloped in GHOSTLY SILENCE, thus becoming a full fledged part of this SIGHT SO LOVELY that not so casually coincedes with her LAST MEMORY OF WINTERFELL, which is also her LAST MEMORY OF SNOW, when <i>Robb was in the yard with snow melting in his hair</i>\u2026 She wonders if she is dreaming because the SNOW all around her and its taste on her lips, it\u2019s what her dreams are made of, it\u2019s what she prays for. She hungers for the days of her innocent childhood in Winterfell, and so she finds herself BUILDING THE CASTLE OF HER DREAMS, aka WINTERFELL, WITH SNOW.</p><p>Well, I think we can all agree that there\u2019s a lot going on here, especially if you think that in the same ASOS of this excerpt Jon is called\u00a0<b>&quot;THE SNOW OF WINTERFELL&rdquo;&hellip;</b>\u00a0But for the matter of this post, what\u2019s most striking to me is that this sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that she describes as similar to Winterfell on the day she left, matches perfectly with Jon\u2019s sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that reminds him of another sight he saw a long while ago&hellip; Could it be that we&rsquo;re talking about the same LOVELY SIGHT?

Already the snowfall lay thick upon the garden below, <b>blanketing the grass, dusting the shrubs and statues with white</b> and weighing down the branches of the trees. <b>The sight took Sansa back to cold nights long ago, in the long summer of her childhood.

She steps into a SNOW WHITE place enveloped in GHOSTLY SILENCE, thus becoming a full fledged part of this SIGHT SO LOVELY that not so casually coincedes with her LAST MEMORY OF WINTERFELL, which is also her LAST MEMORY OF SNOW, when <i>Robb was in the yard with snow melting in his hair</i>\u2026 She wonders if she is dreaming because the SNOW all around her and its taste on her lips, it\u2019s what her dreams are made of, it\u2019s what she prays for. She hungers for the days of her innocent childhood in Winterfell, and so she finds herself BUILDING THE CASTLE OF HER DREAMS, aka WINTERFELL, WITH SNOW.</p><p>Well, I think we can all agree that there\u2019s a lot going on here, especially if you think that in the same ASOS of this excerpt Jon is called\u00a0<b>\"THE SNOW OF WINTERFELL\u201d\u2026</b>\u00a0But for the matter of this post, what\u2019s most striking to me is that this sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that she describes as similar to Winterfell on the day she left, matches perfectly with Jon\u2019s sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that reminds him of another sight he saw a long while ago\u2026 Could it be that we\u2019re talking about the same LOVELY SIGHT?

She steps into a SNOW WHITE place enveloped in GHOSTLY SILENCE, thus becoming a full fledged part of this SIGHT SO LOVELY that not so casually coincedes with her LAST MEMORY OF WINTERFELL, which is also her LAST MEMORY OF SNOW, when <i>Robb was in the yard with snow melting in his hair</i>\u2026 She wonders if she is dreaming because the SNOW all around her and its taste on her lips, it\u2019s what her dreams are made of, it\u2019s what she prays for. She hungers for the days of her innocent childhood in Winterfell, and so she finds herself BUILDING THE CASTLE OF HER DREAMS, aka WINTERFELL, WITH SNOW.</p><p>Well, I think we can all agree that there\u2019s a lot going on here, especially if you think that in the same ASOS of this excerpt Jon is called\u00a0<b>\"THE SNOW OF WINTERFELL\u201d\u2026</b>\u00a0But for the matter of this post, what\u2019s most striking to me is that this sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that she describes as similar to Winterfell on the day she left, matches perfectly with Jon\u2019s sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that reminds him of another sight he saw a long while ago\u2026 Could it be that we\u2019re talking about the same LOVELY SIGHT? Could it be that Sansa is Jon's\u00a0<b>LOVELY</b> memory? I very much think so!</p><p>And I also think the show confirmed it.

He is a bastard no more, and the fact that this meaningful act is so consistent with his last memory of her, it seems crucial to me: she truly cares for him, and he can see that clearly.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b3b99306674aebac667fb185dfefeba/tumblr_inline_pl30enCfK31vseiju_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>Look at him.

You are so beautiful. <b>You&rsquo;re crusted over with snow like some little bear cub, but your face is flushed</b> and you can scarcely breathe..\"&nbsp;(ASOS SANSA VII) &nbsp;<br /></i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7548552b749af94f73d9b7edf55d4fe/tumblr_inline_pl30d7m5bo1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I had to cut it because it&rsquo;s very long, but what I kept should be enough to prove my point: Sansa is a SNOW MAID CLAD ALL IN WHITE and CRUSTED IN SNOW LIKE A BEAR CUB, HER FACE FLASHED FROM THE COLD. She steps into a SNOW WHITE place enveloped in GHOSTLY SILENCE, thus becoming a full fledged part of this SIGHT SO LOVELY that not so casually coincedes with her LAST MEMORY OF WINTERFELL, which is also her LAST MEMORY OF SNOW, when <i>Robb was in the yard with snow melting in his hair</i>&hellip; She wonders if she is dreaming because the SNOW all around her and its taste on her lips, it&rsquo;s what her dreams are made of, it&rsquo;s what she prays for. She hungers for the days of her innocent childhood in Winterfell, and so she finds herself BUILDING THE CASTLE OF HER DREAMS, aka WINTERFELL, WITH SNOW.</p><p>Well, I think we can all agree that there&rsquo;s a lot going on here, especially if you think that in the same ASOS of this excerpt Jon is called&nbsp;<b>\"THE SNOW OF WINTERFELL&rdquo;&hellip;</b>&nbsp;But for the matter of this post, what&rsquo;s most striking to me is that this sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that she describes as similar to Winterfell on the day she left, matches perfectly with Jon&rsquo;s sight <b>SO LOVELY</b> that reminds him of another sight he saw a long while ago&hellip; Could it be that we&rsquo;re talking about the same LOVELY SIGHT? Could it be that Sansa is Jon's&nbsp;<b>LOVELY</b> memory? I very much think so!</p><p>And I also think the show confirmed it. In fact, speaking of Sansa&rsquo;s marriage, look what D&amp;D sneakily threw at us:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fd8986bb663337cd8575445942f0457/tumblr_inline_pl30dpuHYc1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>SHE&rsquo;D MAKE A LOVELY MATCH FOR THE RIGHT SUITOR&hellip;</b></p><p><b></b>Sansa married to <strike>t</strike>he right suitor would be a <b>LOVELY MATCH! </b>Keep in mind that both Sansa and Jon, the only characters called <b>THE BLOOD OF WINTERFELL,</b>&nbsp;many times in the books are linked to marriage and children, and even more, they even have an <b>HUNGER</b> for it:</p><p><i><b>I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, but she might give me children.

Val would want to keep her sister&rsquo;s son, but <b>we could foster him at Winterfell,</b> and Gilly&rsquo;s boy as well. Sam would never need to tell his lie. We&rsquo;d find a place for Gilly too, and Sam could come visit her once a year or so. Mance&rsquo;s son and Craster&rsquo;s would grow up brothers, as I once did with Robb. <b>He wanted it, Jon knew then. He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything. I have always wanted it, he thought, guiltily.</b> May the gods forgive me. <b>IT WAS A HUNGER INSIDE HIM, SHARP AS A DRAGONGLASS BLADE. A HUNGER &hellip; HE COULD FEEL IT.&nbsp;</b> </i>(ASOS, JON XII - <b>CH. 79</b>).</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42632e8883716aea4015ae96dc6ef471/tumblr_inline_pl8crhwiQM1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://jonlovessansa.tumblr.com/post/171210596402/all-hail-the-subtext-i-would-need-to-steal-her-if\">(X)</a></p><p><i><b>It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.</b>&nbsp; When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another day. <b>Another new day. IT WAS THE OLD DAYS SHE HUNGERED FOR. PRAYED FOR. </b>But who could she pray to? The garden had been meant for a godswood once, she knew, but the soil was too thin and stony for a weirwood to take root. A godswood without gods, as empty as me.</i> (ASOS, SANSA VII - <b>CH. 80</b>).</p><p>These are two consecutive chapters: Jon admits that he has always wanted to be the Lord of Winterfell, get married and have children of his own blood, and Sansa, in the same passage I quoted earlier where she&rsquo;s a SNOW MAID CLAD IN WHITE, in the same book where Jon is THE SNOW OF WINTERFELL, while praying for those childwood days when she was still innocent - because <b>&ldquo;CHILDREN KNOW NOTHING&rdquo; -&nbsp;</b>and she was still able to dream of LOVELY things, is saying exactly the same.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33880847ab67c734b035c9a8ba9c79c3/tumblr_inline_pl8bc7fYIE1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This link is present in the show too (<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mO9Z7PNqjUt71DeDK_PlAHA\">@theirwinterfell</a> made a post about Sansa&rsquo;s future children mentioned 16 times), even with scenes bound together with obvious intent: for instance, Ygritte teases Jon about being &ldquo;plucked&rdquo; by him and then Sansa has her first flowering; or Margery sharing with Sansa her insight about men&rsquo;s &ldquo;skills\"&nbsp;right after Tormund tutorial to Jon on how to pleasure a woman&hellip; </p><p>But then came season 6, they reunited and we got this (as we will probably have in the text to come):</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c2bdb013622a4255d4aa62ab8d99ebd3/tumblr_inline_pl30e1iGez1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>As many of you already discussed, this is Sansa CLOAKING Jon, so again, another very clear marriage reference, except this time they&rsquo;re both in the same scene. But this is much more: Sansa doesn&rsquo;t simply CLOAK Jon, she made this cloak herself, she, with her hands, spent time to make a coat for him so he could look and feel like a legitimate Stark <strike>by marriage</strike>.&nbsp;</p><p><b>SHE WANTS HER WOLF TO LOOK LIKE A LORD AND SO SHE SPENDS TIME TO MAKE HIS COAT BEAUTIFUL AND MAJESTIC</b>.</p><p><i><b>Sansa, brushing out Lady&rsquo;s coat&hellip;</b></i></p><p>The parallel is blatant: Sansa loved Lady and took care of her, and now she takes care of Jon and makes him a real Lord. He is a bastard no more, and the fact that this meaningful act is so consistent with his last memory of her, it seems crucial to me: she truly cares for him, and he can see that clearly.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b3b99306674aebac667fb185dfefeba/tumblr_inline_pl30enCfK31vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Look at him.

And she does that in the most honest and &ldquo;Sansa way&rdquo; to him, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s glued in his heart in that LOVELY image that he kept of her, which is at the same time a symbol of LOVELY SANSA as much as it represents what she and her mother (and I could hence add, the world&hellip;), denied to him when he was a child, so it&rsquo;s not a case that here we have a forshadowing of a MARRIAGE as much as we have an echo of a maternal act of caring.</p><p><i>&ldquo;He thought of <b>Robb, with snowflakes melting in his hair.</b> <b>Kill the boy and let the man be born.&rdquo;</b></i><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63157c45b13bef0a82fbd2ba84fa313d/tumblr_inline_pl30fdP7Vk1vseiju_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>This is the moment he becomes a <strike>MARRIED</strike> MAN, and look how happy he is.&nbsp;</p><p>A <b>LOVELY MATCH</b> indeed. </p><p>Though the poor guy still doesn&rsquo;t know how hard he&rsquo;s been hit and how dependent of her validation he really is.<br /></p><p>There are still some very important things to add, but they deserve specific posts.
