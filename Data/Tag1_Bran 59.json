The issue is the three eyed raven.\u201d <br/>\n\u201cOkay. I was willing to hear you out Jojen, but this is getting a bit much.

In his hands is a raven. A normal looking raven that Jojen Reed apparently caught.

                "content": "<p>&ldquo;This is insane.&rdquo; Arya says staring at Jojen. Her brother&rsquo;s best friend had obviously gone mad. <br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not. You know its not&hellip;want a piece?&rdquo; Jojen says, his mouth half full of strawberry and waffle and whipped cream. <br />\n&ldquo;You are saying that Bran is not actually in a coma, but is being controlled by some mutated bird.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;The three eyed raven.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;And your still sitting here. Bran told me what you could do, you know? How you talk to ghosts.&rdquo; <br />\nArya feels her skin prickle at that and tells herself that she is being stupid. This whole thing is stupid. She and Bran had played at being different as children. Bran knew too much because he could see the past and the future. Arya could make friends with anyone living or dead. It had only been a game, a way to comfort herself when she felt isolated in her own home. She knows. The therapist Mother and Father had sent them to was very clear on this. <br />\n&ldquo;Bran was wrong and ghosts aren&rsquo;t even real.&rdquo; <br />\nJojen stares at her thoughtfully as he chews his waffle. He looks much like he did when Howland Reed had first shown up with his children. His eyes are the same spring green color they always have been. That stupid unnerving green color that made one feel as if he could see right through you. <br />\n&ldquo;Bran needs our help&hellip;so does Meera.&rdquo; <br />\nArya grimaces at Meera&rsquo;s name. The two had been friends, though it became a bit awkward when it became clear that Meera and Bran were going to be a&hellip;thing. The night they had found Bran in the forest they had been so happy even if he was in a coma, but the news was dimmed when it was noticed that Meera was missing. <br />\n&ldquo;The doctors are helping Bran and the police will find Meera.&rdquo; Arya tries to make her voice as reassuring as possible. Can she leave now? How cruel is it to leave the best friend of your brother sitting in a Waffle House? <br />\n&ldquo;The doctors cannot help Bran, the issue is not the coma. The issue is the three eyed raven.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;Okay. I was willing to hear you out Jojen, but this is getting a bit much. I&rsquo;m going to go.&rdquo; <br />\n&ldquo;Wait!,&rsquo; he cries grabbing her hand, &lsquo;I can prove it.&rdquo; <br />\nHe lets go of her and reaches for his backpack.
