(it was still pretty funny, though; they spent the whole time of their banishment howling with laughter.)</li><li>peter\u2019s favourite thing, however, is movie nights with his dads. stephen, bucky, and tony cuddle up together on the couch while peter sits on the floor in front of them, rambling about the movie and excitedly flailing around. tony probably gets bored of the movie (there are only so many times the spider-kid can make you watch star wars before you can\u2019t keep paying attention) and leans over to kiss stephen (because bucky actually sits there and watches the movie. nerd.). at that moment, peter turns around to ask his dads something but cuts himself off when he sees his them making out.

The plant, this Black Mercy, hadn\u2019t been any bigger than a nickel then, and in less than an hour and a half, rapidly had gotten larger and that much more aggressive.\u00a0</p><p>Erik hadn\u2019t expected <i>both </i>his cousins to pop up for some reason.\u00a0</p><p>Yea, he\u2019d made progress with reconciling his behavior and all the shitty things he had done to people over the years, to try and be a better man going forward in his relationship with Y/N, but while he and T\u2019Challa, for the most part, buried the hatch and were trying to act like family instead of just former enemies&hellip;</p><p>A proper conversation with Shuri hadn\u2019t happened yet, and he ain\u2019t stupid enough to think it\u2019s water under the bridge.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s what this lunch/dinner thing was supposed to be about; he\u2019d spend time wit his girl and get a handle on how the teenager acted like in his presence, scared, uneasy or whatever, he\u2019d deal with it and proceed from there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA\u2019ight, how we gettin\u2019 this thing off?\u201d Raising an eyebrow at the teenager, the former soldier gave her most of his attention, he couldn\u2019t stop glancing down at his fiancee.\u00a0\u201cBy fire?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAh, it is not so simple as that, cousin&hellip;\u201d T\u2019Challa drawled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Clenching his jaw, he stared at the royal with irritation, \u201cNigga, if you don\u2019t cut the mysterious act an\u2019 tell me how to fix this s&ndash;\u201d Erik\u2019s hands waved threw the air with agitation and the plant&hellip; Hairs standing on the nape of his neck, he turned around just in time to see that a vine-like appendage slither up around Y/N\u2019s neck. Feet moving of his own volition, he is about to step forward and try and get it off, again, but a firm hand on his chest stopped him.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Shuri stated, tone firm.\u00a0Erik shook his head, about to shrug her hand off, but her next words stopped him.\u00a0\u201cYou must not approach with the way you\u2019re behaving. The Black Mercy attaches itself to a host, then traps them in a waking dream state based on their feelings. If this is not handled correctly or if it perceives you as a threat, it will kill her all the quicker and then latch itself onto another, going from person to person, feeding uncontrollably.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Body trembling with the need to move but also realizing the depth and gravity of the situation, Erik shook his head, clenching and unclenching his fists at his sides.\u00a0\u201c&hellip;So, she sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Removing her hand, Shuri nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t in pain?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBeyond the initial\u00a0\u2018bite\u2019 the Black Mercy does not tend to harm it\u2019s host. Keeping a person compliant and docile as it drains it\u2019s vic&hellip;\u201d T\u2019Challa was making a slashing motion across his throat and Shuri snapped out of her\u00a0\u2018SCIENCE!\u2019 mode, lecturing tone becoming sheepish, \u201cA-ah, no! Nope. Y/N is not in pain, not at all really.\u201d<br/></p><p>Erik glanced between the two, shaking his head at their antics before looking at Y/N, so still and sleep, unaware of this sentient death trap attached to her.\u00a0\u201cSo, I\u2019ma ask again: how we gettin\u2019 that thing off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat state of mind was Y/N in prior to all of this? Happy, sad, thoughtful?\u201d T\u2019Challa inquired.\u00a0\u201cClear your mind and embrace that particular emotion only. Talk to her, remind her of all the reasons that she has to cast aside the dream world and return to reality, to you.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d Erik doesn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance.<br/></p><p>\u201cBrother and I will be doing the hard part. Once Y/N is awake and free of the Black Mercy, we only have a few precious seconds to burn it to ash, because during that time it will immediately attempt to attach itself to another host.\u201d Shuri explained.\u00a0\u201cT\u2019Challa has the added protection of the suit, which leaves you and Y/N vulnerable.\u201d Pressing a kimoyo bead on her wrist, Erik\u2019s eyebrows raised to his hairline as familiar kitty gauntlets appeared on her hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will be on burning duty.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSister, when did you make the, uh&hellip;\u201d T\u2019Challa hesitated, eyes darting to Erik then away.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Shuri shrugged, expression innocent.\u00a0\u201cResearch purposes.\u201d Becoming more serious, she looked between both men.\u00a0\u201cEnough playing around. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear your mind.\u201d T\u2019Challa reminded Erik just before the suit materialized from the necklace, covering his entire body.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u2018I\u2019d clear my mind if you\u2019d cut it out wit this Yoda shit!\u2019 Feeling the sting of irritation, he pushes the feeling down and away, gaze focusing on Y/N. Recalling her goofy victory dance, her playful words and her smile.\u00a0<br/></p><p>This time, when he reached for her, the Black Mercy did not react aggressively, though a leathery \u2018tongue\u2019 licks along his arm, but ultimately allows him to move Y/N so that her head is lying in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to risk moving her bodily just yet.</p><p>Erik allowed himself to remember when she\u2019d throw her head back with laughter, shoulders shaking as he hollered at the TV while watching If Loving You is Wrong reruns with her. He remembers how her nose scrunches up and she snickered, describing the childhood crushes and the awkward first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>Mouth opening, the words come surprisingly easy,\u00a0\u201cYou told me that there ain\u2019t been one boyfriend you had that all of your siblings and cousin Breanna could agree was good enough for you. Whether it was the way he walked or talked, or somethin\u2019 else, they always clowned on the dude and eventually drove him away.\u201d</p><p>The Black Mercy chuffed and a vine unwrapped itself from Y/N/s throat. Erik figures that means it\u2019s working.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 you made excuses for why you couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t date. It was no point in bringing the guy to meet a family member, let alone all of\u2019em, because it just ended the same way. So you focused on yo hustle instead. You went to work an\u2019 back to the apartment, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br/></p><p>The vines are rapidly unwinding from her torso, shrinking down.</p><p>\u201cIf you wake up an\u2019 look me in the eyes, I\u2019ll tell you a secret. Something I ain\u2019t tell you about the first time we met. What made me want to holla atchu asap.\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyelids are fluttering and Erik\u2019s so focused on her face that he nearly misses the warning, dodging to the side as T\u2019Challa shouted something indistinct, then lashed out with his claws at the Black Mercy which had revealed a \u2018mouth\u2019 with rows and rows of jagged teeth, as his hit landed, an unsettling screech-roar escaped.\u00a0Rolling with Y/N tucked against his chest, heart beat pounding, he glanced down to see that she\u2019s starting to wake up. Glancing up again when that eerie screech-roar resounded through the house, increasing in higher pitch and frequency as Shuri used her gauntlets to burn the devil plant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNn&hellip;\u201d Using her fist, she rubbed at her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c&hellip;T\u2019 hell is that smell? Did you fart while I was sleeping?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Almost against his will, Erik laughed, genuinely amused.\u00a0\u201cYep, sho did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Smacking his right pec, Y/N\u2019s mouth twisted up.\u00a0\u201cNigga, you nasty! What I tell you\u00a0\u2018bout that shit?! Light an incense or somethin\u2019!\u201d Hand covering her nose, her head turned and she goggled as she caught sight of T\u2019Challa and Shuri. Again, she smacked his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou let me sleep while yo family was here! Oooh, I can\u2019t <i><b>believe </b></i>you!\u201d Then she sent him the look of death.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAy, you was tired. I know the consequences of not letting you get yo rest.

A bit racist, but it was written by a colonizer, so&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Y/N all but died.\u00a0</p><p>Cupping his hands over his mouth,\u00a0\u201c<i>Nerds</i>~\u201d Erik said laughingly.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually, later that night, Y/N does remember that she hadn\u2019t just\u00a0\u2018fallen asleep\u2019 and has a mini freak out, only relaxing when reassured repeatedly that there aren\u2019t many, if any, Black Mercy fields left to speak of.</p><p>\u201cSo, in the future if you ever decide to visit Wakanda, there won\u2019t be any greenery that is harmful to you except the normal plants you should avoid, or what might cause an allergic reaction.\u201d Shuri promised, sounding thoughtful, twirling a forkful of spaghetti.\u00a0\u201cWait, do either of you have allergies?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Erik is busy with his plate, using the homemade garlic bread to swipe up the spaghetti sauce, lifting it to his mouth and finishing it off with two big bites, chewing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d Y/N added, cutting another piece of garlic bread and putting it on his plate, which he accepted without a thought, mouthful, he made a\u00a0\u2018it\u2019s good\u2019 type of hand gesture.\u00a0\u201cIs y\u2019all sure I can visit? I mean, I don\u2019t want to cause any issue.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThere should not be because I\u2019m permitting you to do so.\u201d T\u2019Challa stated, reiterating the fact that he is king and his word is law without explicitly saying so, there\u2019s a nonverbal assurance that if there\u2019s an issue, to bring it him, that you picked up on.\u00a0\u201cThis is delicious, by the way.\u201d Shuri passed him the bowl which had a mix of bbq and fried chicken, using the fork, he added two pieces of each onto his plate.\u00a0\u201cDid you add lemon to the sauce?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cFamily recipe.\u201d Y/N replied, adding some extra spaghetti to her plate.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t swap those\u00a0\u2018round here.\u201d Not even glancing in Erik\u2019s direction, she swatted his fork away from her plate, twirling the spaghetti around the utensil before lifting it to her lips.\u00a0<br/></p><p>T\u2019Challa nodded, accepting that tidbit of information for what it was, instead digging into his meal again.\u00a0</p><p>After dinner is finished and Erik did the dishes with his cousins helping (hindering, really, playing in the water), it\u2019s time for them to go. Y/N surprised Shuri by giving her a hug though the younger girl is quick to hug back, and T\u2019Challa earned a half hug and a quip to take it easy.\u00a0</p><p>The king joked that life would be boring if he did so.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N retreated to the bedroom first and Shuri already walked outside, a car ready for them in the parking lot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d Erik spoke in a low tone.\u00a0\u201cThat plant is only found in Wakanda, but it was addressed to Y/N and sent here. Who sent it? Was that even meant for her?\u201d<br/></p><p>T\u2019Challa said nothing for a moment and then he sighed, seeming to be weighed down.\u00a0\u201cI only alerted the elders about Y/N\u2019s existence after you told me that you proposed.\u201d Erik\u2019s features became thunderous and he held up a hand.\u00a0\u201cI know what you are going to say, but it is better that they remained in the loop. You have always been royalty, only recently, you\u2019re an acknowledged royal, a part of the Golden Tribe like Shuri, Mama, and myself. Even if you do not bring her to Wakanda, if the two of you decide to expand your family, your child will not be denied. Also, by telling them of her, they cannot force an arranged marriage onto you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo whatchu sayin\u2019 is that one of those snooty elders from the Tribes tryna take her out so I can what? Be a free man? Ha!\u201d Jaw tensing, Erik looked at his cousin in the eye, daring him to lie to him, to omit more truths.\u00a0<br/></p><p>T\u2019Challa remained unruffled by his tone and attitude.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saying that it is a possibility, one that I will be exploring extensively, but until I know for sure, I implore you exercise restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf these holier than thou mufuckas tryna take the one good thing I\u2019ve got going for me, the woman that I&hellip;\u201d He paused, faltering.\u00a0\u201cThat I love, then nah, fuck that. Restraint goes out the window and I\u2019ma kill\u2019em all. No second chances, no apologies. I\u2019ma kill\u2019em.\u201d Even if that meant that he lost his\u00a0\u2018officially recognized\u2019 title, then whatever, so be it.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play wit me, this ain\u2019t a joke, nigga.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI am doing my utmost to find the culprit.\u201d T\u2019Challa assured him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust&hellip;give me some time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can take all the time you need. Don\u2019t mean I\u2019ma wait before acting if you pussyfooting around and take too long.\u201d Erik replied flatly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>That statement chilled T\u2019Challa to the bone because he looked exactly like he had when challenging him for the throne, when he declared that he\u2019d spent his whole life waiting to kill him.</p>",

The plant, this Black Mercy, hadn\u2019t been any bigger than a nickel then, and in less than an hour and a half, rapidly had gotten larger and that much more aggressive.\u00a0</p><p>Erik hadn\u2019t expected <i>both </i>his cousins to pop up for some reason.\u00a0</p><p>Yea, he\u2019d made progress with reconciling his behavior and all the shitty things he had done to people over the years, to try and be a better man going forward in his relationship with Y/N, but while he and T\u2019Challa, for the most part, buried the hatch and were trying to act like family instead of just former enemies\u2026</p><p>A proper conversation with Shuri hadn\u2019t happened yet, and he ain\u2019t stupid enough to think it\u2019s water under the bridge.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s what this lunch/dinner thing was supposed to be about; he\u2019d spend time wit his girl and get a handle on how the teenager acted like in his presence, scared, uneasy or whatever, he\u2019d deal with it and proceed from there.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA\u2019ight, how we gettin\u2019 this thing off?\u201d Raising an eyebrow at the teenager, the former soldier gave her most of his attention, he couldn\u2019t stop glancing down at his fiancee.\u00a0\u201cBy fire?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAh, it is not so simple as that, cousin\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa drawled.\u00a0<br></p><p>Clenching his jaw, he stared at the royal with irritation, \u201cNigga, if you don\u2019t cut the mysterious act an\u2019 tell me how to fix this s\u2013\u201d Erik\u2019s hands waved threw the air with agitation and the plant\u2026 Hairs standing on the nape of his neck, he turned around just in time to see that a vine-like appendage slither up around Y/N\u2019s neck. Feet moving of his own volition, he is about to step forward and try and get it off, again, but a firm hand on his chest stopped him.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Shuri stated, tone firm.\u00a0Erik shook his head, about to shrug her hand off, but her next words stopped him.\u00a0\u201cYou must not approach with the way you\u2019re behaving. The Black Mercy attaches itself to a host, then traps them in a waking dream state based on their feelings. If this is not handled correctly or if it perceives you as a threat, it will kill her all the quicker and then latch itself onto another, going from person to person, feeding uncontrollably.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Body trembling with the need to move but also realizing the depth and gravity of the situation, Erik shook his head, clenching and unclenching his fists at his sides.\u00a0\u201c\u2026So, she sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Removing her hand, Shuri nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t in pain?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBeyond the initial\u00a0\u2018bite\u2019 the Black Mercy does not tend to harm it\u2019s host. Keeping a person compliant and docile as it drains it\u2019s vic\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa was making a slashing motion across his throat and Shuri snapped out of her\u00a0\u2018SCIENCE!\u2019 mode, lecturing tone becoming sheepish, \u201cA-ah, no! Nope. Y/N is not in pain, not at all really.\u201d<br></p><p>Erik glanced between the two, shaking his head at their antics before looking at Y/N, so still and sleep, unaware of this sentient death trap attached to her.\u00a0\u201cSo, I\u2019ma ask again: how we gettin\u2019 that thing off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat state of mind was Y/N in prior to all of this? Happy, sad, thoughtful?\u201d T\u2019Challa inquired.\u00a0\u201cClear your mind and embrace that particular emotion only. Talk to her, remind her of all the reasons that she has to cast aside the dream world and return to reality, to you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d Erik doesn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance.<br></p><p>\u201cBrother and I will be doing the hard part. Once Y/N is awake and free of the Black Mercy, we only have a few precious seconds to burn it to ash, because during that time it will immediately attempt to attach itself to another host.\u201d Shuri explained.\u00a0\u201cT\u2019Challa has the added protection of the suit, which leaves you and Y/N vulnerable.\u201d Pressing a kimoyo bead on her wrist, Erik\u2019s eyebrows raised to his hairline as familiar kitty gauntlets appeared on her hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will be on burning duty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSister, when did you make the, uh\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa hesitated, eyes darting to Erik then away.\u00a0<br></p><p>Shuri shrugged, expression innocent.\u00a0\u201cResearch purposes.\u201d Becoming more serious, she looked between both men.\u00a0\u201cEnough playing around. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear your mind.\u201d T\u2019Challa reminded Erik just before the suit materialized from the necklace, covering his entire body.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I\u2019d clear my mind if you\u2019d cut it out wit this Yoda shit!\u2019 Feeling the sting of irritation, he pushes the feeling down and away, gaze focusing on Y/N. Recalling her goofy victory dance, her playful words and her smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>This time, when he reached for her, the Black Mercy did not react aggressively, though a leathery \u2018tongue\u2019 licks along his arm, but ultimately allows him to move Y/N so that her head is lying in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to risk moving her bodily just yet.</p><p>Erik allowed himself to remember when she\u2019d throw her head back with laughter, shoulders shaking as he hollered at the TV while watching If Loving You is Wrong reruns with her. He remembers how her nose scrunches up and she snickered, describing the childhood crushes and the awkward first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>Mouth opening, the words come surprisingly easy,\u00a0\u201cYou told me that there ain\u2019t been one boyfriend you had that all of your siblings and cousin Breanna could agree was good enough for you. Whether it was the way he walked or talked, or somethin\u2019 else, they always clowned on the dude and eventually drove him away.\u201d</p><p>The Black Mercy chuffed and a vine unwrapped itself from Y/N/s throat. Erik figures that means it\u2019s working.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 you made excuses for why you couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t date. It was no point in bringing the guy to meet a family member, let alone all of\u2019em, because it just ended the same way. So you focused on yo hustle instead. You went to work an\u2019 back to the apartment, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br></p><p>The vines are rapidly unwinding from her torso, shrinking down.</p><p>\u201cIf you wake up an\u2019 look me in the eyes, I\u2019ll tell you a secret. Something I ain\u2019t tell you about the first time we met. What made me want to holla atchu asap.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyelids are fluttering and Erik\u2019s so focused on her face that he nearly misses the warning, dodging to the side as T\u2019Challa shouted something indistinct, then lashed out with his claws at the Black Mercy which had revealed a \u2018mouth\u2019 with rows and rows of jagged teeth, as his hit landed, an unsettling screech-roar escaped.\u00a0Rolling with Y/N tucked against his chest, heart beat pounding, he glanced down to see that she\u2019s starting to wake up. Glancing up again when that eerie screech-roar resounded through the house, increasing in higher pitch and frequency as Shuri used her gauntlets to burn the devil plant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNn\u2026\u201d Using her fist, she rubbed at her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026T\u2019 hell is that smell? Did you fart while I was sleeping?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Almost against his will, Erik laughed, genuinely amused.\u00a0\u201cYep, sho did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Smacking his right pec, Y/N\u2019s mouth twisted up.\u00a0\u201cNigga, you nasty! What I tell you\u00a0\u2018bout that shit?! Light an incense or somethin\u2019!\u201d Hand covering her nose, her head turned and she goggled as she caught sight of T\u2019Challa and Shuri. Again, she smacked his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou let me sleep while yo family was here! Oooh, I can\u2019t <i><b>believe </b></i>you!\u201d Then she sent him the look of death.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAy, you was tired. I know the consequences of not letting you get yo rest. The dragon comes out.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"274\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3026d337ba1ae90cf012d7c75f93c5f8/tumblr_inline_pb71zldaP31urazam_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"274\"></figure><p>\u201cN\u2019Jadaka\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa sent him a scolding look, trying to convey with him to stop teasing and tell the truth.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cForreal, one look at her when she heated I ain\u2019t let her get the last chicken wing or something equally petty and I turn to stone.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a Basilisk power.\u201d Shuri and Y/N said at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJinx!\u201d The princess crowed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou read Harry Potter?\u201d Y/N raised an eyebrow, sounding impressed.\u00a0<br></p><p>Shuri snorted.\u00a0\u201cThe movies are horrible.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Throwing her hands up and whooping, she stuck her tongue out.\u00a0\u201c<b>Someone </b>in yo family has taste!\u201d Y/N declared.\u00a0\u201cHe likes <i>the movies</i>.\u201d She added, voice disgusted.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBut those books are a classic. A bit racist, but it was written by a colonizer, so\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N all but died.\u00a0</p><p>Cupping his hands over his mouth,\u00a0\u201c<i>Nerds</i>~\u201d Erik said laughingly.\u00a0</p><p>Eventually, later that night, Y/N does remember that she hadn\u2019t just\u00a0\u2018fallen asleep\u2019 and has a mini freak out, only relaxing when reassured repeatedly that there aren\u2019t many, if any, Black Mercy fields left to speak of.</p><p>\u201cSo, in the future if you ever decide to visit Wakanda, there won\u2019t be any greenery that is harmful to you except the normal plants you should avoid, or what might cause an allergic reaction.\u201d Shuri promised, sounding thoughtful, twirling a forkful of spaghetti.\u00a0\u201cWait, do either of you have allergies?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Erik is busy with his plate, using the homemade garlic bread to swipe up the spaghetti sauce, lifting it to his mouth and finishing it off with two big bites, chewing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d Y/N added, cutting another piece of garlic bread and putting it on his plate, which he accepted without a thought, mouthful, he made a\u00a0\u2018it\u2019s good\u2019 type of hand gesture.\u00a0\u201cIs y\u2019all sure I can visit? I mean, I don\u2019t want to cause any issue.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThere should not be because I\u2019m permitting you to do so.\u201d T\u2019Challa stated, reiterating the fact that he is king and his word is law without explicitly saying so, there\u2019s a nonverbal assurance that if there\u2019s an issue, to bring it him, that you picked up on.\u00a0\u201cThis is delicious, by the way.\u201d Shuri passed him the bowl which had a mix of bbq and fried chicken, using the fork, he added two pieces of each onto his plate.\u00a0\u201cDid you add lemon to the sauce?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFamily recipe.\u201d Y/N replied, adding some extra spaghetti to her plate.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t swap those\u00a0\u2018round here.\u201d Not even glancing in Erik\u2019s direction, she swatted his fork away from her plate, twirling the spaghetti around the utensil before lifting it to her lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa nodded, accepting that tidbit of information for what it was, instead digging into his meal again.\u00a0</p><p>After dinner is finished and Erik did the dishes with his cousins helping (hindering, really, playing in the water), it\u2019s time for them to go. Y/N surprised Shuri by giving her a hug though the younger girl is quick to hug back, and T\u2019Challa earned a half hug and a quip to take it easy.\u00a0</p><p>The king joked that life would be boring if he did so.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N retreated to the bedroom first and Shuri already walked outside, a car ready for them in the parking lot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d Erik spoke in a low tone.\u00a0\u201cThat plant is only found in Wakanda, but it was addressed to Y/N and sent here. Who sent it? Was that even meant for her?\u201d<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa said nothing for a moment and then he sighed, seeming to be weighed down.\u00a0\u201cI only alerted the elders about Y/N\u2019s existence after you told me that you proposed.\u201d Erik\u2019s features became thunderous and he held up a hand.\u00a0\u201cI know what you are going to say, but it is better that they remained in the loop. You have always been royalty, only recently, you\u2019re an acknowledged royal, a part of the Golden Tribe like Shuri, Mama, and myself. Even if you do not bring her to Wakanda, if the two of you decide to expand your family, your child will not be denied. Also, by telling them of her, they cannot force an arranged marriage onto you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo whatchu sayin\u2019 is that one of those snooty elders from the Tribes tryna take her out so I can what? Be a free man? Ha!\u201d Jaw tensing, Erik looked at his cousin in the eye, daring him to lie to him, to omit more truths.\u00a0<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa remained unruffled by his tone and attitude.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saying that it is a possibility, one that I will be exploring extensively, but until I know for sure, I implore you exercise restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf these holier than thou mufuckas tryna take the one good thing I\u2019ve got going for me, the woman that I\u2026\u201d He paused, faltering.\u00a0\u201cThat I love, then nah, fuck that. Restraint goes out the window and I\u2019ma kill\u2019em all. No second chances, no apologies. I\u2019ma kill\u2019em.\u201d Even if that meant that he lost his\u00a0\u2018officially recognized\u2019 title, then whatever, so be it.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play wit me, this ain\u2019t a joke, nigga.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI am doing my utmost to find the culprit.\u201d T\u2019Challa assured him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026give me some time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou can take all the time you need. Don\u2019t mean I\u2019ma wait before acting if you pussyfooting around and take too long.\u201d Erik replied flatly.\u00a0<br></p><p>That statement chilled T\u2019Challa to the bone because he looked exactly like he had when challenging him for the throne, when he declared that he\u2019d spent his whole life waiting to kill him.</p>",

The Black Mercy attaches itself to a host, then traps them in a waking dream state based on their feelings. If this is not handled correctly or if it perceives you as a threat, it will kill her all the quicker and then latch itself onto another, going from person to person, feeding uncontrollably.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Body trembling with the need to move but also realizing the depth and gravity of the situation, Erik shook his head, clenching and unclenching his fists at his sides.\u00a0\u201c\u2026So, she sleepin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Removing her hand, Shuri nodded.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t in pain?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBeyond the initial\u00a0\u2018bite\u2019 the Black Mercy does not tend to harm it\u2019s host. Keeping a person compliant and docile as it drains it\u2019s vic\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa was making a slashing motion across his throat and Shuri snapped out of her\u00a0\u2018SCIENCE!\u2019 mode, lecturing tone becoming sheepish, \u201cA-ah, no! Nope. Y/N is not in pain, not at all really.\u201d<br></p><p>Erik glanced between the two, shaking his head at their antics before looking at Y/N, so still and sleep, unaware of this sentient death trap attached to her.\u00a0\u201cSo, I\u2019ma ask again: how we gettin\u2019 that thing off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat state of mind was Y/N in prior to all of this? Happy, sad, thoughtful?\u201d T\u2019Challa inquired.\u00a0\u201cClear your mind and embrace that particular emotion only. Talk to her, remind her of all the reasons that she has to cast aside the dream world and return to reality, to you.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d Erik doesn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance.<br></p><p>\u201cBrother and I will be doing the hard part. Once Y/N is awake and free of the Black Mercy, we only have a few precious seconds to burn it to ash, because during that time it will immediately attempt to attach itself to another host.\u201d Shuri explained.\u00a0\u201cT\u2019Challa has the added protection of the suit, which leaves you and Y/N vulnerable.\u201d Pressing a kimoyo bead on her wrist, Erik\u2019s eyebrows raised to his hairline as familiar kitty gauntlets appeared on her hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI will be on burning duty.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSister, when did you make the, uh\u2026\u201d T\u2019Challa hesitated, eyes darting to Erik then away.\u00a0<br></p><p>Shuri shrugged, expression innocent.\u00a0\u201cResearch purposes.\u201d Becoming more serious, she looked between both men.\u00a0\u201cEnough playing around. Are we ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear your mind.\u201d T\u2019Challa reminded Erik just before the suit materialized from the necklace, covering his entire body.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2018I\u2019d clear my mind if you\u2019d cut it out wit this Yoda shit!\u2019 Feeling the sting of irritation, he pushes the feeling down and away, gaze focusing on Y/N. Recalling her goofy victory dance, her playful words and her smile.\u00a0<br></p><p>This time, when he reached for her, the Black Mercy did not react aggressively, though a leathery \u2018tongue\u2019 licks along his arm, but ultimately allows him to move Y/N so that her head is lying in his lap.\u00a0</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to risk moving her bodily just yet.</p><p>Erik allowed himself to remember when she\u2019d throw her head back with laughter, shoulders shaking as he hollered at the TV while watching If Loving You is Wrong reruns with her. He remembers how her nose scrunches up and she snickered, describing the childhood crushes and the awkward first kiss.\u00a0</p><p>Mouth opening, the words come surprisingly easy,\u00a0\u201cYou told me that there ain\u2019t been one boyfriend you had that all of your siblings and cousin Breanna could agree was good enough for you. Whether it was the way he walked or talked, or somethin\u2019 else, they always clowned on the dude and eventually drove him away.\u201d</p><p>The Black Mercy chuffed and a vine unwrapped itself from Y/N/s throat. Erik figures that means it\u2019s working.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 you made excuses for why you couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t date. It was no point in bringing the guy to meet a family member, let alone all of\u2019em, because it just ended the same way. So you focused on yo hustle instead. You went to work an\u2019 back to the apartment, that\u2019s it.\u201d<br></p><p>The vines are rapidly unwinding from her torso, shrinking down.</p><p>\u201cIf you wake up an\u2019 look me in the eyes, I\u2019ll tell you a secret. Something I ain\u2019t tell you about the first time we met. What made me want to holla atchu asap.\u201d<br></p><p>Y/N\u2019s eyelids are fluttering and Erik\u2019s so focused on her face that he nearly misses the warning, dodging to the side as T\u2019Challa shouted something indistinct, then lashed out with his claws at the Black Mercy which had revealed a \u2018mouth\u2019 with rows and rows of jagged teeth, as his hit landed, an unsettling screech-roar escaped.\u00a0Rolling with Y/N tucked against his chest, heart beat pounding, he glanced down to see that she\u2019s starting to wake up. Glancing up again when that eerie screech-roar resounded through the house, increasing in higher pitch and frequency as Shuri used her gauntlets to burn the devil plant.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNn\u2026\u201d Using her fist, she rubbed at her eye.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c\u2026T\u2019 hell is that smell? Did you fart while I was sleeping?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Almost against his will, Erik laughed, genuinely amused.\u00a0\u201cYep, sho did.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Smacking his right pec, Y/N\u2019s mouth twisted up.\u00a0\u201cNigga, you nasty! What I tell you\u00a0\u2018bout that shit?! Light an incense or somethin\u2019!\u201d Hand covering her nose, her head turned and she goggled as she caught sight of T\u2019Challa and Shuri. Again, she smacked his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou let me sleep while yo family was here! Oooh, I can\u2019t <i><b>believe </b></i>you!\u201d Then she sent him the look of death.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAy, you was tired. I know the consequences of not letting you get yo rest.

I mean, I don\u2019t want to cause any issue.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThere should not be because I\u2019m permitting you to do so.\u201d T\u2019Challa stated, reiterating the fact that he is king and his word is law without explicitly saying so, there\u2019s a nonverbal assurance that if there\u2019s an issue, to bring it him, that you picked up on.\u00a0\u201cThis is delicious, by the way.\u201d Shuri passed him the bowl which had a mix of bbq and fried chicken, using the fork, he added two pieces of each onto his plate.\u00a0\u201cDid you add lemon to the sauce?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cFamily recipe.\u201d Y/N replied, adding some extra spaghetti to her plate.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t swap those\u00a0\u2018round here.\u201d Not even glancing in Erik\u2019s direction, she swatted his fork away from her plate, twirling the spaghetti around the utensil before lifting it to her lips.\u00a0<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa nodded, accepting that tidbit of information for what it was, instead digging into his meal again.\u00a0</p><p>After dinner is finished and Erik did the dishes with his cousins helping (hindering, really, playing in the water), it\u2019s time for them to go. Y/N surprised Shuri by giving her a hug though the younger girl is quick to hug back, and T\u2019Challa earned a half hug and a quip to take it easy.\u00a0</p><p>The king joked that life would be boring if he did so.\u00a0</p><p>Y/N retreated to the bedroom first and Shuri already walked outside, a car ready for them in the parking lot.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d Erik spoke in a low tone.\u00a0\u201cThat plant is only found in Wakanda, but it was addressed to Y/N and sent here. Who sent it? Was that even meant for her?\u201d<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa said nothing for a moment and then he sighed, seeming to be weighed down.\u00a0\u201cI only alerted the elders about Y/N\u2019s existence after you told me that you proposed.\u201d Erik\u2019s features became thunderous and he held up a hand.\u00a0\u201cI know what you are going to say, but it is better that they remained in the loop. You have always been royalty, only recently, you\u2019re an acknowledged royal, a part of the Golden Tribe like Shuri, Mama, and myself. Even if you do not bring her to Wakanda, if the two of you decide to expand your family, your child will not be denied. Also, by telling them of her, they cannot force an arranged marriage onto you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo whatchu sayin\u2019 is that one of those snooty elders from the Tribes tryna take her out so I can what? Be a free man? Ha!\u201d Jaw tensing, Erik looked at his cousin in the eye, daring him to lie to him, to omit more truths.\u00a0<br></p><p>T\u2019Challa remained unruffled by his tone and attitude.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m saying that it is a possibility, one that I will be exploring extensively, but until I know for sure, I implore you exercise restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf these holier than thou mufuckas tryna take the one good thing I\u2019ve got going for me, the woman that I\u2026\u201d He paused, faltering.\u00a0\u201cThat I love, then nah, fuck that. Restraint goes out the window and I\u2019ma kill\u2019em all. No second chances, no apologies. I\u2019ma kill\u2019em.\u201d Even if that meant that he lost his\u00a0\u2018officially recognized\u2019 title, then whatever, so be it.\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t play wit me, this ain\u2019t a joke, nigga.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI am doing my utmost to find the culprit.\u201d T\u2019Challa assured him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026give me some time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou can take all the time you need. Don\u2019t mean I\u2019ma wait before acting if you pussyfooting around and take too long.\u201d Erik replied flatly.\u00a0<br></p><p>That statement chilled T\u2019Challa to the bone because he looked exactly like he had when challenging him for the throne, when he declared that he\u2019d spent his whole life waiting to kill him.</p>",

If this is not handled correctly or if it perceives you as a threat, it will kill her all the quicker and then latch itself onto another, going from person to person, feeding uncontrollably.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Body trembling with the need to move but also realizing the depth and gravity of the situation, Erik shook his head, clenching and unclenching his fists at his sides.&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;So, she sleepin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>Removing her hand, Shuri nodded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t in pain?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Beyond the initial&nbsp;&lsquo;bite&rsquo; the Black Mercy does not tend to harm it&rsquo;s host. Keeping a person compliant and docile as it drains it&rsquo;s vic&hellip;&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa was making a slashing motion across his throat and Shuri snapped out of her&nbsp;&lsquo;SCIENCE!&rsquo; mode, lecturing tone becoming sheepish, &ldquo;A-ah, no! Nope. Y/N is not in pain, not at all really.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Erik glanced between the two, shaking his head at their antics before looking at Y/N, so still and sleep, unaware of this sentient death trap attached to her.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ma ask again: how we gettin&rsquo; that thing off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What state of mind was Y/N in prior to all of this? Happy, sad, thoughtful?&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa inquired.&nbsp;&ldquo;Clear your mind and embrace that particular emotion only. Talk to her, remind her of all the reasons that she has to cast aside the dream world and return to reality, to you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo; Erik doesn&rsquo;t want to leave anything to chance.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Brother and I will be doing the hard part. Once Y/N is awake and free of the Black Mercy, we only have a few precious seconds to burn it to ash, because during that time it will immediately attempt to attach itself to another host.&rdquo; Shuri explained.&nbsp;&ldquo;T&rsquo;Challa has the added protection of the suit, which leaves you and Y/N vulnerable.&rdquo; Pressing a kimoyo bead on her wrist, Erik&rsquo;s eyebrows raised to his hairline as familiar kitty gauntlets appeared on her hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I will be on burning duty.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sister, when did you make the, uh&hellip;&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa hesitated, eyes darting to Erik then away.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Shuri shrugged, expression innocent.&nbsp;&ldquo;Research purposes.&rdquo; Becoming more serious, she looked between both men.&nbsp;&ldquo;Enough playing around. Are we ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clear your mind.&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa reminded Erik just before the suit materialized from the necklace, covering his entire body.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d clear my mind if you&rsquo;d cut it out wit this Yoda shit!&rsquo; Feeling the sting of irritation, he pushes the feeling down and away, gaze focusing on Y/N. Recalling her goofy victory dance, her playful words and her smile.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>This time, when he reached for her, the Black Mercy did not react aggressively, though a leathery &lsquo;tongue&rsquo; licks along his arm, but ultimately allows him to move Y/N so that her head is lying in his lap.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to risk moving her bodily just yet.</p><p>Erik allowed himself to remember when she&rsquo;d throw her head back with laughter, shoulders shaking as he hollered at the TV while watching If Loving You is Wrong reruns with her. He remembers how her nose scrunches up and she snickered, describing the childhood crushes and the awkward first kiss.&nbsp;</p><p>Mouth opening, the words come surprisingly easy,&nbsp;&ldquo;You told me that there ain&rsquo;t been one boyfriend you had that all of your siblings and cousin Breanna could agree was good enough for you. Whether it was the way he walked or talked, or somethin&rsquo; else, they always clowned on the dude and eventually drove him away.&rdquo;</p><p>The Black Mercy chuffed and a vine unwrapped itself from Y/N/s throat. Erik figures that means it&rsquo;s working.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you made excuses for why you couldn&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t date. It was no point in bringing the guy to meet a family member, let alone all of&rsquo;em, because it just ended the same way. So you focused on yo hustle instead. You went to work an&rsquo; back to the apartment, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The vines are rapidly unwinding from her torso, shrinking down.</p><p>&ldquo;If you wake up an&rsquo; look me in the eyes, I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret. Something I ain&rsquo;t tell you about the first time we met. What made me want to holla atchu asap.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s eyelids are fluttering and Erik&rsquo;s so focused on her face that he nearly misses the warning, dodging to the side as T&rsquo;Challa shouted something indistinct, then lashed out with his claws at the Black Mercy which had revealed a &lsquo;mouth&rsquo; with rows and rows of jagged teeth, as his hit landed, an unsettling screech-roar escaped.&nbsp;Rolling with Y/N tucked against his chest, heart beat pounding, he glanced down to see that she&rsquo;s starting to wake up. Glancing up again when that eerie screech-roar resounded through the house, increasing in higher pitch and frequency as Shuri used her gauntlets to burn the devil plant.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nn&hellip;&rdquo; Using her fist, she rubbed at her eye.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;T&rsquo; hell is that smell? Did you fart while I was sleeping?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Almost against his will, Erik laughed, genuinely amused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep, sho did.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Smacking his right pec, Y/N&rsquo;s mouth twisted up.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nigga, you nasty! What I tell you&nbsp;&lsquo;bout that shit?! Light an incense or somethin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Hand covering her nose, her head turned and she goggled as she caught sight of T&rsquo;Challa and Shuri. Again, she smacked his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You let me sleep while yo family was here! Oooh, I can&rsquo;t <i><b>believe </b></i>you!&rdquo; Then she sent him the look of death.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, you was tired. I know the consequences of not letting you get yo rest. The dragon comes out.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3026d337ba1ae90cf012d7c75f93c5f8/tumblr_inline_pb71zldaP31urazam_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;N&rsquo;Jadaka&hellip;&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa sent him a scolding look, trying to convey with him to stop teasing and tell the truth.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Forreal, one look at her when she heated I ain&rsquo;t let her get the last chicken wing or something equally petty and I turn to stone.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Basilisk power.&rdquo; Shuri and Y/N said at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jinx!&rdquo; The princess crowed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You read Harry Potter?&rdquo; Y/N raised an eyebrow, sounding impressed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Shuri snorted.&nbsp;&ldquo;The movies are horrible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Throwing her hands up and whooping, she stuck her tongue out.&nbsp;&ldquo;<b>Someone </b>in yo family has taste!&rdquo; Y/N declared.&nbsp;&ldquo;He likes <i>the movies</i>.&rdquo; She added, voice disgusted.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But those books are a classic. A bit racist, but it was written by a colonizer, so&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Y/N all but died.&nbsp;</p><p>Cupping his hands over his mouth,&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Nerds</i>~&rdquo; Erik said laughingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, later that night, Y/N does remember that she hadn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;&lsquo;fallen asleep&rsquo; and has a mini freak out, only relaxing when reassured repeatedly that there aren&rsquo;t many, if any, Black Mercy fields left to speak of.</p><p>&ldquo;So, in the future if you ever decide to visit Wakanda, there won&rsquo;t be any greenery that is harmful to you except the normal plants you should avoid, or what might cause an allergic reaction.&rdquo; Shuri promised, sounding thoughtful, twirling a forkful of spaghetti.&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait, do either of you have allergies?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nah.&rdquo; Erik is busy with his plate, using the homemade garlic bread to swipe up the spaghetti sauce, lifting it to his mouth and finishing it off with two big bites, chewing.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Me either.&rdquo; Y/N added, cutting another piece of garlic bread and putting it on his plate, which he accepted without a thought, mouthful, he made a&nbsp;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s good&rsquo; type of hand gesture.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is y&rsquo;all sure I can visit? I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to cause any issue.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;There should not be because I&rsquo;m permitting you to do so.&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa stated, reiterating the fact that he is king and his word is law without explicitly saying so, there&rsquo;s a nonverbal assurance that if there&rsquo;s an issue, to bring it him, that you picked up on.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is delicious, by the way.&rdquo; Shuri passed him the bowl which had a mix of bbq and fried chicken, using the fork, he added two pieces of each onto his plate.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you add lemon to the sauce?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Family recipe.&rdquo; Y/N replied, adding some extra spaghetti to her plate.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t swap those&nbsp;&lsquo;round here.&rdquo; Not even glancing in Erik&rsquo;s direction, she swatted his fork away from her plate, twirling the spaghetti around the utensil before lifting it to her lips.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>T&rsquo;Challa nodded, accepting that tidbit of information for what it was, instead digging into his meal again.&nbsp;</p><p>After dinner is finished and Erik did the dishes with his cousins helping (hindering, really, playing in the water), it&rsquo;s time for them to go. Y/N surprised Shuri by giving her a hug though the younger girl is quick to hug back, and T&rsquo;Challa earned a half hug and a quip to take it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>The king joked that life would be boring if he did so.&nbsp;</p><p>Y/N retreated to the bedroom first and Shuri already walked outside, a car ready for them in the parking lot.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;One thing that&rsquo;s been bothering me.&rdquo; Erik spoke in a low tone.&nbsp;&ldquo;That plant is only found in Wakanda, but it was addressed to Y/N and sent here. Who sent it? Was that even meant for her?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>T&rsquo;Challa said nothing for a moment and then he sighed, seeming to be weighed down.&nbsp;&ldquo;I only alerted the elders about Y/N&rsquo;s existence after you told me that you proposed.&rdquo; Erik&rsquo;s features became thunderous and he held up a hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;I know what you are going to say, but it is better that they remained in the loop. You have always been royalty, only recently, you&rsquo;re an acknowledged royal, a part of the Golden Tribe like Shuri, Mama, and myself. Even if you do not bring her to Wakanda, if the two of you decide to expand your family, your child will not be denied. Also, by telling them of her, they cannot force an arranged marriage onto you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So whatchu sayin&rsquo; is that one of those snooty elders from the Tribes tryna take her out so I can what? Be a free man? Ha!&rdquo; Jaw tensing, Erik looked at his cousin in the eye, daring him to lie to him, to omit more truths.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>T&rsquo;Challa remained unruffled by his tone and attitude.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that it is a possibility, one that I will be exploring extensively, but until I know for sure, I implore you exercise restraint.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If these holier than thou mufuckas tryna take the one good thing I&rsquo;ve got going for me, the woman that I&hellip;&rdquo; He paused, faltering.&nbsp;&ldquo;That I love, then nah, fuck that. Restraint goes out the window and I&rsquo;ma kill&rsquo;em all. No second chances, no apologies. I&rsquo;ma kill&rsquo;em.&rdquo; Even if that meant that he lost his&nbsp;&lsquo;officially recognized&rsquo; title, then whatever, so be it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play wit me, this ain&rsquo;t a joke, nigga.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I am doing my utmost to find the culprit.&rdquo; T&rsquo;Challa assured him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just&hellip;give me some time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can take all the time you need. Don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ma wait before acting if you pussyfooting around and take too long.&rdquo; Erik replied flatly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>That statement chilled T&rsquo;Challa to the bone because he looked exactly like he had when challenging him for the throne, when he declared that he&rsquo;d spent his whole life waiting to kill him.</p>",
