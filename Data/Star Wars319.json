Some\nobjects were displayed in shining cabinets, some on their own pedestals, others\nyet contained within energy fields.</p><p>The sound that Ulfran at the sight of the room and its\ncontents bordered on lustful.</p><p>Ahuska\u2019a snickered and jabbed a clawed finger into his side.\n\u201cNerd.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Kassandra\u2019s eyes roved the artifacts desperately, not\nknowing what to look for yet still determined to beat them to it. She had no\nplans for beyond that, merely a vague hope that somehow possessing the Shard\nwould grant her the ability to out-do the callous Sith and the cruel Bothan.</p><p>\u201cSo? Which one is it\u2026?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a needled Ulfran, not wanting\nto wait a moment longer. </p><p>\u201cI need a moment,\u201d he lied. He\u2019d spotted the Shard almost\nimmediately, over to the far left of the room. But he\u2019d never described the\nartifact to Ahuska\u2019a, never let on that he knew exactly what to search for.\nBecause as much as he\u2019d enjoyed her brutish company in accomplishing his goal,\nhe certainly didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Ulfran prowled the room, his hungry eyes taking it all in.\nSome items he recognized immediately, others he could only make educated\nguesses, and he immediately wished he\u2019d come better prepared to take more. </p><p>The others followed, stepping softly across the pristine\nfloor. Three sets of guarded, glimmering red eyes probed the collection of\ntreasures. Ahuska\u2019a noted the way Ulfran veered well clear of a sizeable stone\npyramid, settled on a high pedestal behind \na glittering orange field. Ulfran noted the way Kassandra watched them\nboth like a wary prey beast, the way she seemed coiled and tense, ready to dart\nat any moment. The tension in the room was stifling.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, Ulfran worked his way over to a dagger\nthat was arranged artfully on a fold of silk, behind a mere wall of glass.\nNothing like the roughly cut crystal the others were half expecting to find,\nbut he knew it was there, forged into the blade, disguised long before it would\nhave fallen into Ronan Ve\u2019lora\u2019s hands. He wondered if he could take it\nsomehow, make it look like a passing whim, a secondary prize while he sought\nout the \u2018real\u2019 shard&hellip;</p><p>But his gaze lingered on it a little too long. Ahuska\u2019a and\nKassandra both guessed at what the dagger must be, and Kassandra moved like\nlightning. Only to be struck by lightning. She grabbed an ornamental scepter\nfrom a rack by the wall, swinging it into the glass cabinet that guarded the\nweapon, and in the next hearbeat Ulfran thrust her away with a liberal\nthundering of the Force. Electrical charges surged through her body and she\nwrithed on the floor, seething.</p><p>With the shard\u2019s casing now in pieces on the floor, Ulfran\nreached for the dagger, and nothing could compare to the \u00a0heady satisfaction that welled up inside him\nto finally possess what he had chased for so long. It was his. <i>It was his!</i></p><p>\u201cBit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a \u00a0sidled up to him, motioning toward the prone\nKassandra with a tilt of her snout.</p><p>Ulfran sidestepped away from her with a sneer, and a\nfiercely possessive glint in his scarlet eyes.</p><p>She watched him warily, her own eyes narrowing slowly,\nfingers toying with the switch on her whip. \u201cCome on then. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\nLet\u2019s get out of here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Still Ulfran hesitated. Suddenly, the thought of letting\nanyone else utilise the shard was abhorrent.</p><p>A moment of hurt flashed across Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s expression as she\nsaw that change come upon him, and then there was naught but fury in her eyes.\n\u201cUlfran. We did this together. What makes you think you can get a-\u201c</p><p>But her sentence was cut short as a blast of the Force\npropelled her backward, crashing into an electrified field that flung her to\nthe ground, shaking violently. \u201cChakaar,\u201d she cursed at him in her native\ntongue, fighting to regain her breath and find her feet.</p><p>But he was already darting away from her, intent on his\nexit, only to have his feet swept out from under him as Kassandra swung that\nscepter again, completely unexpectedly from behind the cabinet she\u2019d crawled over\nto, unnoticed. He swore colourfully as he fell, slamming into a marble pedestal\nthat rocked lazily before it, too, toppled to the ground, yet still he clutched\nthe dagger\u2026 at least, until a flash of red flicked out from where Ahuska\u2019a\nstaggered to her feet, lashing at his hand with her whip.</p><p>She had it set searingly hot; Ulfran\u2019s voice and breath were\nboth knocked out of him as the knife dropped to the ground, along with half of\nhis hand. All colour drained from his cheeks, his eyes went wide with rage and\nshock, and he channeled every bit of that pain into the rending Force thrust\nthat he directed at the two women who both dove for the dagger as it skittered\nacross the floor.</p><p>Kassandra cried out sharply at the cutting wind that tore at\nher, curling in on herself and turning away from the source of the blast that\nmade her feel as though her skin was going to be torn off. But Ahuska\u2019a\u2026 she\nsnarled, facing into it, flinging her arms forward with a firm and throaty \u201c<i>NO</i>.\u201d And she was just as surprised as\nUlfran when he found himself flung bodily backward through the vault.</p><p>Breathing hard from the exertion, the Bothan lurched toward\nthe dagger unimpeded, and it was very nearly in her grasp\u2026 when Ulfran tugged\nit forward, gripping it artfully with the Force and sending it coasting through\nthe air toward him. </p><p>From which Kassandra snatched it before it could reach him.</p><p>Again that red glare flashed through the air, but Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s\naim was thrown out by the sudden distracting movement in the corner of her eye,\nand she had to leap to dodge that great stone pyramid as Ulfran lifted his\nburned, bloodied half-hand to send it sweeping through the air toward her. As\nit hit the ground with a heavy thud, Ahuska\u2019a then flung herself toward\nKassandra, not knowing how she could possibly win with the Sith now against\nher, but unwilling to back down. Even as she bore down on the Chiss, she saw\nhim lift his hands again, and the hunk of carved stone once more lifted into\nthe air. She lashed her whip but couldn\u2019t reach him\u2026 she bolted forward,\nenraged, throwing herself toward the pyramid and slamming bodily into it,\nforcing it back toward him.</p><p>As she hit it, the world spun and brilliant white light\nbloomed behind her eyes.</p><p>So unexpected was her action that Ulfran barely had the time\nto mouth \u2018no..!\u2019 before both Ahuska and the stone slammed into him, and he too\nfelt his perception of the world grow slippery. He was completely unaware of\nKassandra following up behind Ahsuka\u2019a, operating purely on adrenaline, arm\nlifted high before it plunged down somewhere at the Bothan\u2019s back, delving the\ndagger deep into her.</p><p>The three were locked in place, with the stone pyramid\nbetween them.</p><p>Everything was white.</p><p>An endless expanse of white <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Ulfran felt a horrid, overwhelming sense of vertigo, as he\ntried to get his bearings. Tried to find some way to ground himself. But he\nknew where he was; where they all must be. Trapped inside that object he had\nfeared to touch. A mind prison. Where was Nela?</p><p>No, wait\u2026</p><p>Ulfran shook his head, nearly losing his balance as his head\nspun. Nela? Who was\u2026 \u00a0no. Kassandra?\nAhuska? Who was he? <i>Which</i> was he? He\nhad fallen, fallen so far, and the version of him that had succumbed to power\nand desire was suddenly overwhelmingly aware of the one who had not, and the\nshame he felt was dizzying. What was going on? This wasn\u2019t real. This was just\na vision, just one of Nela\u2019s visions\u2026 no, no, he had the shard, <i>they had the shard</i>, he had to figure out\nhow to use it and fix things so that he could be that better version of himself,\nhe had to wake up, he\u2026</p><p><i>Ulfran, I\u2019m scared!\nWhere are you??!</i> Nela\u2019s voice whipped through the blinding whiteness, and\nhe spun, but it all looked the same. Endless. Empty.</p><p><i>What is this! Where\nare we!?</i> Nines\u2026 no, Kassandra?</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, we\u2019re trapped, let me try to find\nyou\u2026!\u201d Ulfran shouted into the void, fearing that the expanse swallowed his\nvoice before any of the others could perceive it. \u201cKriff,\u201d \u00a0part of him fought hard for calm, told\nhimself he must rise above the panic. Part of him wanted to rage and thrash\nabout, set the endless white up in flames.</p><p><b>OH, HELLO.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!!</i></p><p>\u201cBe quiet! Be still! We\u2019re not alone in here!\u201d Ulfran had no\nidea if they could hear him, but somehow he was positive that that whatever was\nbehind that other voice could.</p><p><i>What is it!!?? Help,\nit\u2019s all around\u2026!! Ulfran please, get us out..!</i></p><p><b>LOOK AT YOU ALL! SO\nLONG, I HAVE AWAITED A VESSEL. AND NOW I AM SPOILED FOR CHOICE!</b></p><p>Dread welled up inside him. What was happening? How had he\nand Nela shifted from observers to participants in this re-telling of time? Who\nthe kriff was Nela, and where the kriff was Kassandra with that dagger?</p><p><b>THE RULES OF TIME DO\nNOT APPLY HERE. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THIS BREACH.</b></p><p>Ulfran felt something, then. Like fingers of ice, crawling\nacross his skin. He jerked away and stared about, but there was nothing to see.</p><p><b>STRONG, BUT NOT AS\nSTRONG AS HER. SHE WILL SERVE BETTER.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!! </i>Nela\u2019s\nthought-voice had raised to a shriek. <i>It\u2019s\ntrying to get me! I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to get us out\u2026 aah!</i></p><p>Ulfran wrestled with himself, as part of him cast about\ndesperately with the Force, trying to get a sense of Kassandra or Ahuska\u2019a. To\nfind them, seize the shard, and maybe with its power manage to free himself and\ncontinue his mission. But the rest of him fought back fiercely, unwilling to\nlet half of his self simply abandon Nela to whatever fate, whatever long\nimprisoned being was now clawing for her. He would not leave her! Gathering himself\ntogether, Ulfran threw all reservations to the wind and flung himself through\nthe endless wasteland of the prison, giving in to the ethereal nature of the\nplace. He probed and reached with the Force, felt its ebb and flow, sought out\nthat dreadful, tickling cold attached to that smug, otherworldly voice. <i>The rules of time do not apply here</i>, it\nhad said. Something was broken, breached, not as it should be.</p><p>And as he searched, he found\u2026 Ahuska. No, Ahuska\u2019a. \u00a0Her life force flickering, fading, as outside\nof the prison her physical body also began to fail, with the Tempus shard stuck\nfirm inside her. There was something particularly intangible about her, a\nshimmering aspect to her Force presence that Ulfran had never encountered\nbefore.</p><p><i>Help,</i> she called\nout with her mind<i>. I\u2019m lost. I need to\u2026\nto fix\u2026 I need Crow. No. Mar\u2019an? Who is\u2026 oh help. I\u2019m lost, I don\u2019t know how-</i></p><p><i>ULFRAAANN!</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m coming, Nela! I\u2019m\ncoming! </i>Completely uncertain about what he was doing, operating in streams\nof the Force that were utterly unknown to him, Ulfran tried to sweep up\nAhuska\u2019a\u2019s presence and carry it with him as he rushed toward Nela\u2019s screams\nand that bitter, evil cold that threatened her.</p><p><i>Ulfran!</i></p><p>Something buffeted him to the side, a heavy blow that\nrattled him through and burned at the same time<i>. LET HER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!!</i> Half of Ulfran knew\nthat voice, cringed at that voice roaring through his head, and his\nbewilderment only grew. How was he here!? Pain ruptured all over him, or echoes\nof pain, he knew about it, but only felt it distantly&hellip; he heard, or felt, or\nknew about a crack\u2026 his face? His jaw? Endlessly he was pummeled, sworn at,\nclawed at, and he tried in vain to shake Crow off while he sought out the being\nthat was wrapping its icy tendrils around Nela.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>LIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.<i></i></p><p><i>LET ME GO! </i>Ulfran tried\nto ignore him, spread his presence thin and intangible as he came crashing\nthrough the smothering whiteness, hurling every bit of mental energy he had\ntoward the being that desired to use Nela to escape its imprisonment. <i>GET OFF HER! You will not have her!</i> He\ncouldn\u2019t fix a shape to the being he fought, only a vague sense of size, the\nidea of shimmering purple hues, a feeling of ancient bitterness and\nmalevolence. He felt the strength of his darker half joining the battle,\nmeeting the being with his own wrath and hateful fury.</p><p><i>You have to help fix\nthis, Nela,</i> he shouted, prying her presence away and wrapping it up with\nthe Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s.</p><p>Suddenly it was as though the entirety of existence opened\nup in front of him. Oh, he\u2019d always known how powerfully the Force had flown\nthrough Nela, but now he <i>saw</i> it. He\nfelt it. And with his greater understanding and familiarity of its nature&hellip;\nwith Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s dying presence embedded with the power of that glittering\nshard&hellip; he knew what had to happen with absolute clarity.</p><p>As easily as swinging open an unlocked door, he made the way\nfor them, and gently pushed Nela and the Bothan through. <i>Help her fix this.</i></p><p>The way closed, and icy daggers thrust through him. <b>THIEF. I WILL END YOU AND THEN I WILL TAKE\nHER.</b></p><p><i>LIKE FETHIN\u2019 HELL YOU\nWILL!</i> The fight was joined by Kassandra, hurtling through, her essence a\nwild and formless mess of fury, unable to contain the raw emotion she felt with\nany sense of shape or scale. She simply was, and she was pissed, and she didn\u2019t\nlike this thing all in her space.</p><p><i>BRING ME BACK MY STARS\nDAMNED DAUGHTER.</i></p><p><b>YOU ARE MINE.</b></p><p>Ulfran knew nothing but pain. He fought desperately to free\nhimself, and every tendril he tore out was new agony. His spirit was being torn\napart while his body, somewhere, distantly, was being battered. All he had was the hope that Nela would know what to do.</p><p>***</p><p>Ahuska stood on the dirty pavement of a grimy alleyway in\nthe Coruscant undercity. Nela was there, hunched and whimpering, holding her\nhead the way she did when she had her episodes.</p><p>She felt strange, light, and wondered where her dogs were.\nNo, where her nexu was. She didn\u2019t have any dogs.</p><p>\u201cNel? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to fix it. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Everything felt just faintly off, like the whole world was\nout of sync with itself. \u201cFix what?\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Nela stood and stared about, then\ngrabbed for Ahuska\u2019s hand to pull her over to the far end of the alley. A\ntowering, graffiti riddled wall dominated the intersection, forcing beings to\neither turn hard left, hard right, or go back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cThe wall? I\u2026 nnng. Ow.\u201d Ahuska turned and winced, grasping\nat her back. Something hurt there, she could swear there was something wedged\nbetween her shoulders, except her flailing hand couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, hurry, I think it\u2019s going to kill him. We don\u2019t\nhave time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what? What am I supposed to fix?\u201d</p><p>Nela was kicking through the bags of rubbish that littered\nthe streets, or at least she was trying to, but her feet were passing through\neverything and she groaned with frustration. \u201cYou need to draw. Pick that up, I\ncan\u2019t. You\u2019re more here than I am.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska stooped to pick up the piece of chalk Nela indicated,\nfeeling more confused by the moment. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry! Draw Meatballs\u2026 the- the wolf. Right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw him there! On the wall, you have to make him point to\nthe right.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska walked up to the wall as though in a haze, doing as\nNela bid. She drew hastily, a very quick and crude rendition of the animal,\nbecause she really wanted to go back and see if the girl was okay. She worried\nabout her.</p><p>This was a very odd little dream she was having.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran woke to pain, aches all over, a splitting headache\nand some new searing sensation in his jaw. He rolled across the floor, some\nexternal force shoving him away. He tried to ask what was going on, but it hurt\nto move his mouth. He was kicked again, rolling a little further along the\nfloor.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and it was unbridled fury that stared\nhim in the face. Crow was seething, snarling, itching to continue his assault.\nNines stood behind him, fists clenched, with only Lyrisal\u2019s hand on her\nshoulder keeping her at bay. And Ahuska had placed herself protectively between\nhim and Nela, glaring at him with all the ferocity of a mother wolf.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/425d3fb092a80a90db3c3d09188889ad/tumblr_inline_pbhzc1HW1p1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"/></figure><p>\u201cYou call this TEACHING!?\u201d Crow roared. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to\nbe <i>helping her</i>, not sneaking onto my\nship and doing\u2026 whatever the feth that was\u2026!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ulfran strained to find his voice, to defend himself,\nwhile his mind still reeled from what he\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>\u201cDad, leave him alone, i-it was my fault, please\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, Nel.\u201d Ahuska tried to soothe her. Waking up to the\nsound of Nela\u2019s screams and Crow\u2019s bellowing had shaken her, and seeing her\nsitting there with Ulfran, both of them transfixed and frozen, had been even\nmore rattling.</p><p>Crow had not reacted particularly gracefully. Lurching off the\ncouch in a barely woken state, he didn\u2019t hesitate to take a swing at the man,\nbut it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect. Nela was still screaming, her hand\nwrapped around his wrist, and he tried to pry her fingers free to no avail. \u201cLET\nHER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!\u201d he\u2019d shouted, and somewhere from the\ndepths of his trance Ulfran had wheezed out a pained response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.\u201d Crow had begun\nhis assault in earnest, and nothing was going to stop him freeing Nela.</p><p>It was to this that Ahuska had woken from her strange dream,\njust moments before Nela\u2019s own eyes burst open, and the girl reeled back with a\ngasp while Crow moved in to kick Ulfran away, forcing distance between himself\nand his daughter.</p><p>Ulfran tried to set his thoughts straight. Tried to ground\nhimself back in reality. They were all staring at him; Crow, Ahuska and Nines\nwere furious, Lyrisal blank-faced save the lift of a single questioning\neyebrow, and Nela, her eyes wide, haunted, confused, having just been through\nit all with him but having an even harder time making sense of it all.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, Ulfran. I think we\u2026 fixed it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cQUIET,\u00a0 Nel,\u201d Crow interrupted, still glaring daggers at Ulfran.<br/></p><p>Ulfran cringed back, lowering his head. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going.\u201d He\nknew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to explain what had happened in a hurry. He\ncould barely speak, and none of them seemed to be in the mood to listen. He\nhurt, everywhere, and knew he had to get out.</p><p>Ulfran fled Crow\u2019s ship, and Nela\u2019s family crowded around\nher. He felt the savage heat of their love for one another as he staggered away\nacross the cold sand.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran made himself scarce, the next few days. He didn\u2019t\nwant to draw more ire upon himself, and his fractured jaw needed rest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nalso had a terrible amount of thinking to do.\n\n\n\n</p><p>He spent a great deal of time in meditation, and actively\navoided contact with the Deserters.</p><p>It was Nela who eventually came to him, one morning,\ntrotting over as he was headed toward the medical barracks, both for his own check-up and\nto see how the other patients were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly, reaching out to just briefly\ntouch his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI went chasing after things I\nshouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept we had to,\u201d she stated. \u201cAhuska had to draw the\nwolf.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran paused his step, and he shot Nela a very odd look. It\nwas too much for him to wrap his head around, trying to sort what had been\nreal, or if any had been at all. Had they truly changed things? Had the reality\nthey\u2019d known actually been in any danger, had they needed to go back and fix\nthings to increase the odds of Crow turning right? Had they undone time, had\nthey always been living in an altered version of events\u2026? What had they\nactually experienced? He had no answers. He couldn\u2019t accept it as simply as\nNela seemed to. But his urgency to locate and destroy the shard had been\nrekindled, because his twisting, hopeless over-thinking always wound up leading\nto a single conclusion. That power, if it was real, was something no being\nshould ever wield.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so mad any more. I tried to explain why it was\nso important, and that it was&hellip; all my fault. Dad doesn\u2019t actually want me to\nstop learning from you. We just\u2026 scared them all a bit.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran stared at her a long while. In the timeline where\nCrow had turned left, everything had fallen apart at the end, because there had\nbeen no trust. No love between them. But here, now, in the timeline where Crow had\ngone the right way&hellip; maybe they were in with a fighting chance.</p><p>\u201cNela,\u201d he started, speaking as softly as he had to to avoid\nexcessive pain rioting through his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize what an important person your father is?\u201d</p><p>\n\nNela stared at him as though he\u2019d said something utterly daft. \u201cWell\nof course he is, dummy. What in the universe could ever be more important than\nyour family?\u201d</p><p>&mdash;\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",

She had no\nplans for beyond that, merely a vague hope that somehow possessing the Shard\nwould grant her the ability to out-do the callous Sith and the cruel Bothan.</p><p>\u201cSo? Which one is it\u2026?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a needled Ulfran, not wanting\nto wait a moment longer. </p><p>\u201cI need a moment,\u201d he lied. He\u2019d spotted the Shard almost\nimmediately, over to the far left of the room. But he\u2019d never described the\nartifact to Ahuska\u2019a, never let on that he knew exactly what to search for.\nBecause as much as he\u2019d enjoyed her brutish company in accomplishing his goal,\nhe certainly didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Ulfran prowled the room, his hungry eyes taking it all in.\nSome items he recognized immediately, others he could only make educated\nguesses, and he immediately wished he\u2019d come better prepared to take more. </p><p>The others followed, stepping softly across the pristine\nfloor. Three sets of guarded, glimmering red eyes probed the collection of\ntreasures. Ahuska\u2019a noted the way Ulfran veered well clear of a sizeable stone\npyramid, settled on a high pedestal behind \na glittering orange field. Ulfran noted the way Kassandra watched them\nboth like a wary prey beast, the way she seemed coiled and tense, ready to dart\nat any moment. The tension in the room was stifling.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, Ulfran worked his way over to a dagger\nthat was arranged artfully on a fold of silk, behind a mere wall of glass.\nNothing like the roughly cut crystal the others were half expecting to find,\nbut he knew it was there, forged into the blade, disguised long before it would\nhave fallen into Ronan Ve\u2019lora\u2019s hands. He wondered if he could take it\nsomehow, make it look like a passing whim, a secondary prize while he sought\nout the \u2018real\u2019 shard\u2026</p><p>But his gaze lingered on it a little too long. Ahuska\u2019a and\nKassandra both guessed at what the dagger must be, and Kassandra moved like\nlightning. Only to be struck by lightning. She grabbed an ornamental scepter\nfrom a rack by the wall, swinging it into the glass cabinet that guarded the\nweapon, and in the next hearbeat Ulfran thrust her away with a liberal\nthundering of the Force. Electrical charges surged through her body and she\nwrithed on the floor, seething.</p><p>With the shard\u2019s casing now in pieces on the floor, Ulfran\nreached for the dagger, and nothing could compare to the \u00a0heady satisfaction that welled up inside him\nto finally possess what he had chased for so long. It was his. <i>It was his!</i></p><p>\u201cBit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a \u00a0sidled up to him, motioning toward the prone\nKassandra with a tilt of her snout.</p><p>Ulfran sidestepped away from her with a sneer, and a\nfiercely possessive glint in his scarlet eyes.</p><p>She watched him warily, her own eyes narrowing slowly,\nfingers toying with the switch on her whip. \u201cCome on then. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\nLet\u2019s get out of here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Still Ulfran hesitated. Suddenly, the thought of letting\nanyone else utilise the shard was abhorrent.</p><p>A moment of hurt flashed across Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s expression as she\nsaw that change come upon him, and then there was naught but fury in her eyes.\n\u201cUlfran. We did this together. What makes you think you can get a-\u201c</p><p>But her sentence was cut short as a blast of the Force\npropelled her backward, crashing into an electrified field that flung her to\nthe ground, shaking violently. \u201cChakaar,\u201d she cursed at him in her native\ntongue, fighting to regain her breath and find her feet.</p><p>But he was already darting away from her, intent on his\nexit, only to have his feet swept out from under him as Kassandra swung that\nscepter again, completely unexpectedly from behind the cabinet she\u2019d crawled over\nto, unnoticed. He swore colourfully as he fell, slamming into a marble pedestal\nthat rocked lazily before it, too, toppled to the ground, yet still he clutched\nthe dagger\u2026 at least, until a flash of red flicked out from where Ahuska\u2019a\nstaggered to her feet, lashing at his hand with her whip.</p><p>She had it set searingly hot; Ulfran\u2019s voice and breath were\nboth knocked out of him as the knife dropped to the ground, along with half of\nhis hand. All colour drained from his cheeks, his eyes went wide with rage and\nshock, and he channeled every bit of that pain into the rending Force thrust\nthat he directed at the two women who both dove for the dagger as it skittered\nacross the floor.</p><p>Kassandra cried out sharply at the cutting wind that tore at\nher, curling in on herself and turning away from the source of the blast that\nmade her feel as though her skin was going to be torn off. But Ahuska\u2019a\u2026 she\nsnarled, facing into it, flinging her arms forward with a firm and throaty \u201c<i>NO</i>.\u201d And she was just as surprised as\nUlfran when he found himself flung bodily backward through the vault.</p><p>Breathing hard from the exertion, the Bothan lurched toward\nthe dagger unimpeded, and it was very nearly in her grasp\u2026 when Ulfran tugged\nit forward, gripping it artfully with the Force and sending it coasting through\nthe air toward him. </p><p>From which Kassandra snatched it before it could reach him.</p><p>Again that red glare flashed through the air, but Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s\naim was thrown out by the sudden distracting movement in the corner of her eye,\nand she had to leap to dodge that great stone pyramid as Ulfran lifted his\nburned, bloodied half-hand to send it sweeping through the air toward her. As\nit hit the ground with a heavy thud, Ahuska\u2019a then flung herself toward\nKassandra, not knowing how she could possibly win with the Sith now against\nher, but unwilling to back down. Even as she bore down on the Chiss, she saw\nhim lift his hands again, and the hunk of carved stone once more lifted into\nthe air. She lashed her whip but couldn\u2019t reach him\u2026 she bolted forward,\nenraged, throwing herself toward the pyramid and slamming bodily into it,\nforcing it back toward him.</p><p>As she hit it, the world spun and brilliant white light\nbloomed behind her eyes.</p><p>So unexpected was her action that Ulfran barely had the time\nto mouth \u2018no..!\u2019 before both Ahuska and the stone slammed into him, and he too\nfelt his perception of the world grow slippery. He was completely unaware of\nKassandra following up behind Ahsuka\u2019a, operating purely on adrenaline, arm\nlifted high before it plunged down somewhere at the Bothan\u2019s back, delving the\ndagger deep into her.</p><p>The three were locked in place, with the stone pyramid\nbetween them.</p><p>Everything was white.</p><p>An endless expanse of white <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Ulfran felt a horrid, overwhelming sense of vertigo, as he\ntried to get his bearings. Tried to find some way to ground himself. But he\nknew where he was; where they all must be. Trapped inside that object he had\nfeared to touch. A mind prison. Where was Nela?</p><p>No, wait\u2026</p><p>Ulfran shook his head, nearly losing his balance as his head\nspun. Nela? Who was\u2026 \u00a0no. Kassandra?\nAhuska? Who was he? <i>Which</i> was he? He\nhad fallen, fallen so far, and the version of him that had succumbed to power\nand desire was suddenly overwhelmingly aware of the one who had not, and the\nshame he felt was dizzying. What was going on? This wasn\u2019t real. This was just\na vision, just one of Nela\u2019s visions\u2026 no, no, he had the shard, <i>they had the shard</i>, he had to figure out\nhow to use it and fix things so that he could be that better version of himself,\nhe had to wake up, he\u2026</p><p><i>Ulfran, I\u2019m scared!\nWhere are you??!</i> Nela\u2019s voice whipped through the blinding whiteness, and\nhe spun, but it all looked the same. Endless. Empty.</p><p><i>What is this! Where\nare we!?</i> Nines\u2026 no, Kassandra?</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, we\u2019re trapped, let me try to find\nyou\u2026!\u201d Ulfran shouted into the void, fearing that the expanse swallowed his\nvoice before any of the others could perceive it. \u201cKriff,\u201d \u00a0part of him fought hard for calm, told\nhimself he must rise above the panic. Part of him wanted to rage and thrash\nabout, set the endless white up in flames.</p><p><b>OH, HELLO.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!!</i></p><p>\u201cBe quiet! Be still! We\u2019re not alone in here!\u201d Ulfran had no\nidea if they could hear him, but somehow he was positive that that whatever was\nbehind that other voice could.</p><p><i>What is it!!?? Help,\nit\u2019s all around\u2026!! Ulfran please, get us out..!</i></p><p><b>LOOK AT YOU ALL! SO\nLONG, I HAVE AWAITED A VESSEL. AND NOW I AM SPOILED FOR CHOICE!</b></p><p>Dread welled up inside him. What was happening? How had he\nand Nela shifted from observers to participants in this re-telling of time? Who\nthe kriff was Nela, and where the kriff was Kassandra with that dagger?</p><p><b>THE RULES OF TIME DO\nNOT APPLY HERE. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THIS BREACH.</b></p><p>Ulfran felt something, then. Like fingers of ice, crawling\nacross his skin. He jerked away and stared about, but there was nothing to see.</p><p><b>STRONG, BUT NOT AS\nSTRONG AS HER. SHE WILL SERVE BETTER.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!! </i>Nela\u2019s\nthought-voice had raised to a shriek. <i>It\u2019s\ntrying to get me! I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to get us out\u2026 aah!</i></p><p>Ulfran wrestled with himself, as part of him cast about\ndesperately with the Force, trying to get a sense of Kassandra or Ahuska\u2019a. To\nfind them, seize the shard, and maybe with its power manage to free himself and\ncontinue his mission. But the rest of him fought back fiercely, unwilling to\nlet half of his self simply abandon Nela to whatever fate, whatever long\nimprisoned being was now clawing for her. He would not leave her! Gathering himself\ntogether, Ulfran threw all reservations to the wind and flung himself through\nthe endless wasteland of the prison, giving in to the ethereal nature of the\nplace. He probed and reached with the Force, felt its ebb and flow, sought out\nthat dreadful, tickling cold attached to that smug, otherworldly voice. <i>The rules of time do not apply here</i>, it\nhad said. Something was broken, breached, not as it should be.</p><p>And as he searched, he found\u2026 Ahuska. No, Ahuska\u2019a. \u00a0Her life force flickering, fading, as outside\nof the prison her physical body also began to fail, with the Tempus shard stuck\nfirm inside her. There was something particularly intangible about her, a\nshimmering aspect to her Force presence that Ulfran had never encountered\nbefore.</p><p><i>Help,</i> she called\nout with her mind<i>. I\u2019m lost. I need to\u2026\nto fix\u2026 I need Crow. No. Mar\u2019an? Who is\u2026 oh help. I\u2019m lost, I don\u2019t know how-</i></p><p><i>ULFRAAANN!</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m coming, Nela! I\u2019m\ncoming! </i>Completely uncertain about what he was doing, operating in streams\nof the Force that were utterly unknown to him, Ulfran tried to sweep up\nAhuska\u2019a\u2019s presence and carry it with him as he rushed toward Nela\u2019s screams\nand that bitter, evil cold that threatened her.</p><p><i>Ulfran!</i></p><p>Something buffeted him to the side, a heavy blow that\nrattled him through and burned at the same time<i>. LET HER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!!</i> Half of Ulfran knew\nthat voice, cringed at that voice roaring through his head, and his\nbewilderment only grew. How was he here!? Pain ruptured all over him, or echoes\nof pain, he knew about it, but only felt it distantly\u2026 he heard, or felt, or\nknew about a crack\u2026 his face? His jaw? Endlessly he was pummeled, sworn at,\nclawed at, and he tried in vain to shake Crow off while he sought out the being\nthat was wrapping its icy tendrils around Nela.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>LIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.<i></i></p><p><i>LET ME GO! </i>Ulfran tried\nto ignore him, spread his presence thin and intangible as he came crashing\nthrough the smothering whiteness, hurling every bit of mental energy he had\ntoward the being that desired to use Nela to escape its imprisonment. <i>GET OFF HER! You will not have her!</i> He\ncouldn\u2019t fix a shape to the being he fought, only a vague sense of size, the\nidea of shimmering purple hues, a feeling of ancient bitterness and\nmalevolence. He felt the strength of his darker half joining the battle,\nmeeting the being with his own wrath and hateful fury.</p><p><i>You have to help fix\nthis, Nela,</i> he shouted, prying her presence away and wrapping it up with\nthe Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s.</p><p>Suddenly it was as though the entirety of existence opened\nup in front of him. Oh, he\u2019d always known how powerfully the Force had flown\nthrough Nela, but now he <i>saw</i> it. He\nfelt it. And with his greater understanding and familiarity of its nature\u2026\nwith Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s dying presence embedded with the power of that glittering\nshard\u2026 he knew what had to happen with absolute clarity.</p><p>As easily as swinging open an unlocked door, he made the way\nfor them, and gently pushed Nela and the Bothan through. <i>Help her fix this.</i></p><p>The way closed, and icy daggers thrust through him. <b>THIEF. I WILL END YOU AND THEN I WILL TAKE\nHER.</b></p><p><i>LIKE FETHIN\u2019 HELL YOU\nWILL!</i> The fight was joined by Kassandra, hurtling through, her essence a\nwild and formless mess of fury, unable to contain the raw emotion she felt with\nany sense of shape or scale. She simply was, and she was pissed, and she didn\u2019t\nlike this thing all in her space.</p><p><i>BRING ME BACK MY STARS\nDAMNED DAUGHTER.</i></p><p><b>YOU ARE MINE.</b></p><p>Ulfran knew nothing but pain. He fought desperately to free\nhimself, and every tendril he tore out was new agony. His spirit was being torn\napart while his body, somewhere, distantly, was being battered. All he had was the hope that Nela would know what to do.</p><p>***</p><p>Ahuska stood on the dirty pavement of a grimy alleyway in\nthe Coruscant undercity. Nela was there, hunched and whimpering, holding her\nhead the way she did when she had her episodes.</p><p>She felt strange, light, and wondered where her dogs were.\nNo, where her nexu was. She didn\u2019t have any dogs.</p><p>\u201cNel? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to fix it. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Everything felt just faintly off, like the whole world was\nout of sync with itself. \u201cFix what?\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Nela stood and stared about, then\ngrabbed for Ahuska\u2019s hand to pull her over to the far end of the alley. A\ntowering, graffiti riddled wall dominated the intersection, forcing beings to\neither turn hard left, hard right, or go back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cThe wall? I\u2026 nnng. Ow.\u201d Ahuska turned and winced, grasping\nat her back. Something hurt there, she could swear there was something wedged\nbetween her shoulders, except her flailing hand couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, hurry, I think it\u2019s going to kill him. We don\u2019t\nhave time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what? What am I supposed to fix?\u201d</p><p>Nela was kicking through the bags of rubbish that littered\nthe streets, or at least she was trying to, but her feet were passing through\neverything and she groaned with frustration. \u201cYou need to draw. Pick that up, I\ncan\u2019t. You\u2019re more here than I am.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska stooped to pick up the piece of chalk Nela indicated,\nfeeling more confused by the moment. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry! Draw Meatballs\u2026 the- the wolf. Right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw him there! On the wall, you have to make him point to\nthe right.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska walked up to the wall as though in a haze, doing as\nNela bid. She drew hastily, a very quick and crude rendition of the animal,\nbecause she really wanted to go back and see if the girl was okay. She worried\nabout her.</p><p>This was a very odd little dream she was having.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran woke to pain, aches all over, a splitting headache\nand some new searing sensation in his jaw. He rolled across the floor, some\nexternal force shoving him away. He tried to ask what was going on, but it hurt\nto move his mouth. He was kicked again, rolling a little further along the\nfloor.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and it was unbridled fury that stared\nhim in the face. Crow was seething, snarling, itching to continue his assault.\nNines stood behind him, fists clenched, with only Lyrisal\u2019s hand on her\nshoulder keeping her at bay. And Ahuska had placed herself protectively between\nhim and Nela, glaring at him with all the ferocity of a mother wolf.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/425d3fb092a80a90db3c3d09188889ad/tumblr_inline_pbhzc1HW1p1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"></figure><p>\u201cYou call this TEACHING!?\u201d Crow roared. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to\nbe <i>helping her</i>, not sneaking onto my\nship and doing\u2026 whatever the feth that was\u2026!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ulfran strained to find his voice, to defend himself,\nwhile his mind still reeled from what he\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>\u201cDad, leave him alone, i-it was my fault, please\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, Nel.\u201d Ahuska tried to soothe her. Waking up to the\nsound of Nela\u2019s screams and Crow\u2019s bellowing had shaken her, and seeing her\nsitting there with Ulfran, both of them transfixed and frozen, had been even\nmore rattling.</p><p>Crow had not reacted particularly gracefully. Lurching off the\ncouch in a barely woken state, he didn\u2019t hesitate to take a swing at the man,\nbut it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect. Nela was still screaming, her hand\nwrapped around his wrist, and he tried to pry her fingers free to no avail. \u201cLET\nHER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!\u201d he\u2019d shouted, and somewhere from the\ndepths of his trance Ulfran had wheezed out a pained response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.\u201d Crow had begun\nhis assault in earnest, and nothing was going to stop him freeing Nela.</p><p>It was to this that Ahuska had woken from her strange dream,\njust moments before Nela\u2019s own eyes burst open, and the girl reeled back with a\ngasp while Crow moved in to kick Ulfran away, forcing distance between himself\nand his daughter.</p><p>Ulfran tried to set his thoughts straight. Tried to ground\nhimself back in reality. They were all staring at him; Crow, Ahuska and Nines\nwere furious, Lyrisal blank-faced save the lift of a single questioning\neyebrow, and Nela, her eyes wide, haunted, confused, having just been through\nit all with him but having an even harder time making sense of it all.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, Ulfran. I think we\u2026 fixed it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cQUIET,\u00a0 Nel,\u201d Crow interrupted, still glaring daggers at Ulfran.<br></p><p>Ulfran cringed back, lowering his head. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going.\u201d He\nknew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to explain what had happened in a hurry. He\ncould barely speak, and none of them seemed to be in the mood to listen. He\nhurt, everywhere, and knew he had to get out.</p><p>Ulfran fled Crow\u2019s ship, and Nela\u2019s family crowded around\nher. He felt the savage heat of their love for one another as he staggered away\nacross the cold sand.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran made himself scarce, the next few days. He didn\u2019t\nwant to draw more ire upon himself, and his fractured jaw needed rest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nalso had a terrible amount of thinking to do.\n\n\n\n</p><p>He spent a great deal of time in meditation, and actively\navoided contact with the Deserters.</p><p>It was Nela who eventually came to him, one morning,\ntrotting over as he was headed toward the medical barracks, both for his own check-up and\nto see how the other patients were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly, reaching out to just briefly\ntouch his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI went chasing after things I\nshouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept we had to,\u201d she stated. \u201cAhuska had to draw the\nwolf.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran paused his step, and he shot Nela a very odd look. It\nwas too much for him to wrap his head around, trying to sort what had been\nreal, or if any had been at all. Had they truly changed things? Had the reality\nthey\u2019d known actually been in any danger, had they needed to go back and fix\nthings to increase the odds of Crow turning right? Had they undone time, had\nthey always been living in an altered version of events\u2026? What had they\nactually experienced? He had no answers. He couldn\u2019t accept it as simply as\nNela seemed to. But his urgency to locate and destroy the shard had been\nrekindled, because his twisting, hopeless over-thinking always wound up leading\nto a single conclusion. That power, if it was real, was something no being\nshould ever wield.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so mad any more. I tried to explain why it was\nso important, and that it was\u2026 all my fault. Dad doesn\u2019t actually want me to\nstop learning from you. We just\u2026 scared them all a bit.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran stared at her a long while. In the timeline where\nCrow had turned left, everything had fallen apart at the end, because there had\nbeen no trust. No love between them. But here, now, in the timeline where Crow had\ngone the right way\u2026 maybe they were in with a fighting chance.</p><p>\u201cNela,\u201d he started, speaking as softly as he had to to avoid\nexcessive pain rioting through his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize what an important person your father is?\u201d</p><p>\n\nNela stared at him as though he\u2019d said something utterly daft. \u201cWell\nof course he is, dummy. What in the universe could ever be more important than\nyour family?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",

Some\nobjects were displayed in shining cabinets, some on their own pedestals, others\nyet contained within energy fields.</p><p>The sound that Ulfran at the sight of the room and its\ncontents bordered on lustful.</p><p>Ahuska\u2019a snickered and jabbed a clawed finger into his side.\n\u201cNerd.\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>Kassandra\u2019s eyes roved the artifacts desperately, not\nknowing what to look for yet still determined to beat them to it. She had no\nplans for beyond that, merely a vague hope that somehow possessing the Shard\nwould grant her the ability to out-do the callous Sith and the cruel Bothan.</p><p>\u201cSo? Which one is it\u2026?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a needled Ulfran, not wanting\nto wait a moment longer. </p><p>\u201cI need a moment,\u201d he lied. He\u2019d spotted the Shard almost\nimmediately, over to the far left of the room. But he\u2019d never described the\nartifact to Ahuska\u2019a, never let on that he knew exactly what to search for.\nBecause as much as he\u2019d enjoyed her brutish company in accomplishing his goal,\nhe certainly didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Ulfran prowled the room, his hungry eyes taking it all in.\nSome items he recognized immediately, others he could only make educated\nguesses, and he immediately wished he\u2019d come better prepared to take more. </p><p>The others followed, stepping softly across the pristine\nfloor. Three sets of guarded, glimmering red eyes probed the collection of\ntreasures. Ahuska\u2019a noted the way Ulfran veered well clear of a sizeable stone\npyramid, settled on a high pedestal behind \na glittering orange field. Ulfran noted the way Kassandra watched them\nboth like a wary prey beast, the way she seemed coiled and tense, ready to dart\nat any moment. The tension in the room was stifling.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, Ulfran worked his way over to a dagger\nthat was arranged artfully on a fold of silk, behind a mere wall of glass.\nNothing like the roughly cut crystal the others were half expecting to find,\nbut he knew it was there, forged into the blade, disguised long before it would\nhave fallen into Ronan Ve\u2019lora\u2019s hands. He wondered if he could take it\nsomehow, make it look like a passing whim, a secondary prize while he sought\nout the \u2018real\u2019 shard\u2026</p><p>But his gaze lingered on it a little too long. Ahuska\u2019a and\nKassandra both guessed at what the dagger must be, and Kassandra moved like\nlightning. Only to be struck by lightning. She grabbed an ornamental scepter\nfrom a rack by the wall, swinging it into the glass cabinet that guarded the\nweapon, and in the next hearbeat Ulfran thrust her away with a liberal\nthundering of the Force. Electrical charges surged through her body and she\nwrithed on the floor, seething.</p><p>With the shard\u2019s casing now in pieces on the floor, Ulfran\nreached for the dagger, and nothing could compare to the \u00a0heady satisfaction that welled up inside him\nto finally possess what he had chased for so long. It was his. <i>It was his!</i></p><p>\u201cBit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Ahuska\u2019a \u00a0sidled up to him, motioning toward the prone\nKassandra with a tilt of her snout.</p><p>Ulfran sidestepped away from her with a sneer, and a\nfiercely possessive glint in his scarlet eyes.</p><p>She watched him warily, her own eyes narrowing slowly,\nfingers toying with the switch on her whip. \u201cCome on then. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\nLet\u2019s get out of here\u2026\u201d</p><p>Still Ulfran hesitated. Suddenly, the thought of letting\nanyone else utilise the shard was abhorrent.</p><p>A moment of hurt flashed across Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s expression as she\nsaw that change come upon him, and then there was naught but fury in her eyes.\n\u201cUlfran. We did this together. What makes you think you can get a-\u201c</p><p>But her sentence was cut short as a blast of the Force\npropelled her backward, crashing into an electrified field that flung her to\nthe ground, shaking violently. \u201cChakaar,\u201d she cursed at him in her native\ntongue, fighting to regain her breath and find her feet.</p><p>But he was already darting away from her, intent on his\nexit, only to have his feet swept out from under him as Kassandra swung that\nscepter again, completely unexpectedly from behind the cabinet she\u2019d crawled over\nto, unnoticed. He swore colourfully as he fell, slamming into a marble pedestal\nthat rocked lazily before it, too, toppled to the ground, yet still he clutched\nthe dagger\u2026 at least, until a flash of red flicked out from where Ahuska\u2019a\nstaggered to her feet, lashing at his hand with her whip.</p><p>She had it set searingly hot; Ulfran\u2019s voice and breath were\nboth knocked out of him as the knife dropped to the ground, along with half of\nhis hand. All colour drained from his cheeks, his eyes went wide with rage and\nshock, and he channeled every bit of that pain into the rending Force thrust\nthat he directed at the two women who both dove for the dagger as it skittered\nacross the floor.</p><p>Kassandra cried out sharply at the cutting wind that tore at\nher, curling in on herself and turning away from the source of the blast that\nmade her feel as though her skin was going to be torn off. But Ahuska\u2019a\u2026 she\nsnarled, facing into it, flinging her arms forward with a firm and throaty \u201c<i>NO</i>.\u201d And she was just as surprised as\nUlfran when he found himself flung bodily backward through the vault.</p><p>Breathing hard from the exertion, the Bothan lurched toward\nthe dagger unimpeded, and it was very nearly in her grasp\u2026 when Ulfran tugged\nit forward, gripping it artfully with the Force and sending it coasting through\nthe air toward him. </p><p>From which Kassandra snatched it before it could reach him.</p><p>Again that red glare flashed through the air, but Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s\naim was thrown out by the sudden distracting movement in the corner of her eye,\nand she had to leap to dodge that great stone pyramid as Ulfran lifted his\nburned, bloodied half-hand to send it sweeping through the air toward her. As\nit hit the ground with a heavy thud, Ahuska\u2019a then flung herself toward\nKassandra, not knowing how she could possibly win with the Sith now against\nher, but unwilling to back down. Even as she bore down on the Chiss, she saw\nhim lift his hands again, and the hunk of carved stone once more lifted into\nthe air. She lashed her whip but couldn\u2019t reach him\u2026 she bolted forward,\nenraged, throwing herself toward the pyramid and slamming bodily into it,\nforcing it back toward him.</p><p>As she hit it, the world spun and brilliant white light\nbloomed behind her eyes.</p><p>So unexpected was her action that Ulfran barely had the time\nto mouth \u2018no..!\u2019 before both Ahuska and the stone slammed into him, and he too\nfelt his perception of the world grow slippery. He was completely unaware of\nKassandra following up behind Ahsuka\u2019a, operating purely on adrenaline, arm\nlifted high before it plunged down somewhere at the Bothan\u2019s back, delving the\ndagger deep into her.</p><p>The three were locked in place, with the stone pyramid\nbetween them.</p><p>Everything was white.</p><p>An endless expanse of white <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Ulfran felt a horrid, overwhelming sense of vertigo, as he\ntried to get his bearings. Tried to find some way to ground himself. But he\nknew where he was; where they all must be. Trapped inside that object he had\nfeared to touch. A mind prison. Where was Nela?</p><p>No, wait\u2026</p><p>Ulfran shook his head, nearly losing his balance as his head\nspun. Nela? Who was\u2026 \u00a0no. Kassandra?\nAhuska? Who was he? <i>Which</i> was he? He\nhad fallen, fallen so far, and the version of him that had succumbed to power\nand desire was suddenly overwhelmingly aware of the one who had not, and the\nshame he felt was dizzying. What was going on? This wasn\u2019t real. This was just\na vision, just one of Nela\u2019s visions\u2026 no, no, he had the shard, <i>they had the shard</i>, he had to figure out\nhow to use it and fix things so that he could be that better version of himself,\nhe had to wake up, he\u2026</p><p><i>Ulfran, I\u2019m scared!\nWhere are you??!</i> Nela\u2019s voice whipped through the blinding whiteness, and\nhe spun, but it all looked the same. Endless. Empty.</p><p><i>What is this! Where\nare we!?</i> Nines\u2026 no, Kassandra?</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, we\u2019re trapped, let me try to find\nyou\u2026!\u201d Ulfran shouted into the void, fearing that the expanse swallowed his\nvoice before any of the others could perceive it. \u201cKriff,\u201d \u00a0part of him fought hard for calm, told\nhimself he must rise above the panic. Part of him wanted to rage and thrash\nabout, set the endless white up in flames.</p><p><b>OH, HELLO.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!!</i></p><p>\u201cBe quiet! Be still! We\u2019re not alone in here!\u201d Ulfran had no\nidea if they could hear him, but somehow he was positive that that whatever was\nbehind that other voice could.</p><p><i>What is it!!?? Help,\nit\u2019s all around\u2026!! Ulfran please, get us out..!</i></p><p><b>LOOK AT YOU ALL! SO\nLONG, I HAVE AWAITED A VESSEL. AND NOW I AM SPOILED FOR CHOICE!</b></p><p>Dread welled up inside him. What was happening? How had he\nand Nela shifted from observers to participants in this re-telling of time? Who\nthe kriff was Nela, and where the kriff was Kassandra with that dagger?</p><p><b>THE RULES OF TIME DO\nNOT APPLY HERE. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THIS BREACH.</b></p><p>Ulfran felt something, then. Like fingers of ice, crawling\nacross his skin. He jerked away and stared about, but there was nothing to see.</p><p><b>STRONG, BUT NOT AS\nSTRONG AS HER. SHE WILL SERVE BETTER.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!! </i>Nela\u2019s\nthought-voice had raised to a shriek. <i>It\u2019s\ntrying to get me! I can\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to get us out\u2026 aah!</i></p><p>Ulfran wrestled with himself, as part of him cast about\ndesperately with the Force, trying to get a sense of Kassandra or Ahuska\u2019a. To\nfind them, seize the shard, and maybe with its power manage to free himself and\ncontinue his mission. But the rest of him fought back fiercely, unwilling to\nlet half of his self simply abandon Nela to whatever fate, whatever long\nimprisoned being was now clawing for her. He would not leave her! Gathering himself\ntogether, Ulfran threw all reservations to the wind and flung himself through\nthe endless wasteland of the prison, giving in to the ethereal nature of the\nplace. He probed and reached with the Force, felt its ebb and flow, sought out\nthat dreadful, tickling cold attached to that smug, otherworldly voice. <i>The rules of time do not apply here</i>, it\nhad said. Something was broken, breached, not as it should be.</p><p>And as he searched, he found\u2026 Ahuska. No, Ahuska\u2019a. \u00a0Her life force flickering, fading, as outside\nof the prison her physical body also began to fail, with the Tempus shard stuck\nfirm inside her. There was something particularly intangible about her, a\nshimmering aspect to her Force presence that Ulfran had never encountered\nbefore.</p><p><i>Help,</i> she called\nout with her mind<i>. I\u2019m lost. I need to\u2026\nto fix\u2026 I need Crow. No. Mar\u2019an? Who is\u2026 oh help. I\u2019m lost, I don\u2019t know how-</i></p><p><i>ULFRAAANN!</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m coming, Nela! I\u2019m\ncoming! </i>Completely uncertain about what he was doing, operating in streams\nof the Force that were utterly unknown to him, Ulfran tried to sweep up\nAhuska\u2019a\u2019s presence and carry it with him as he rushed toward Nela\u2019s screams\nand that bitter, evil cold that threatened her.</p><p><i>Ulfran!</i></p><p>Something buffeted him to the side, a heavy blow that\nrattled him through and burned at the same time<i>. LET HER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!!</i> Half of Ulfran knew\nthat voice, cringed at that voice roaring through his head, and his\nbewilderment only grew. How was he here!? Pain ruptured all over him, or echoes\nof pain, he knew about it, but only felt it distantly\u2026 he heard, or felt, or\nknew about a crack\u2026 his face? His jaw? Endlessly he was pummeled, sworn at,\nclawed at, and he tried in vain to shake Crow off while he sought out the being\nthat was wrapping its icy tendrils around Nela.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>LIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.<i></i></p><p><i>LET ME GO! </i>Ulfran tried\nto ignore him, spread his presence thin and intangible as he came crashing\nthrough the smothering whiteness, hurling every bit of mental energy he had\ntoward the being that desired to use Nela to escape its imprisonment. <i>GET OFF HER! You will not have her!</i> He\ncouldn\u2019t fix a shape to the being he fought, only a vague sense of size, the\nidea of shimmering purple hues, a feeling of ancient bitterness and\nmalevolence. He felt the strength of his darker half joining the battle,\nmeeting the being with his own wrath and hateful fury.</p><p><i>You have to help fix\nthis, Nela,</i> he shouted, prying her presence away and wrapping it up with\nthe Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s.</p><p>Suddenly it was as though the entirety of existence opened\nup in front of him. Oh, he\u2019d always known how powerfully the Force had flown\nthrough Nela, but now he <i>saw</i> it. He\nfelt it. And with his greater understanding and familiarity of its nature\u2026\nwith Ahuska\u2019a\u2019s dying presence embedded with the power of that glittering\nshard\u2026 he knew what had to happen with absolute clarity.</p><p>As easily as swinging open an unlocked door, he made the way\nfor them, and gently pushed Nela and the Bothan through. <i>Help her fix this.</i></p><p>The way closed, and icy daggers thrust through him. <b>THIEF. I WILL END YOU AND THEN I WILL TAKE\nHER.</b></p><p><i>LIKE FETHIN\u2019 HELL YOU\nWILL!</i> The fight was joined by Kassandra, hurtling through, her essence a\nwild and formless mess of fury, unable to contain the raw emotion she felt with\nany sense of shape or scale. She simply was, and she was pissed, and she didn\u2019t\nlike this thing all in her space.</p><p><i>BRING ME BACK MY STARS\nDAMNED DAUGHTER.</i></p><p><b>YOU ARE MINE.</b></p><p>Ulfran knew nothing but pain. He fought desperately to free\nhimself, and every tendril he tore out was new agony. His spirit was being torn\napart while his body, somewhere, distantly, was being battered. All he had was the hope that Nela would know what to do.</p><p>***</p><p>Ahuska stood on the dirty pavement of a grimy alleyway in\nthe Coruscant undercity. Nela was there, hunched and whimpering, holding her\nhead the way she did when she had her episodes.</p><p>She felt strange, light, and wondered where her dogs were.\nNo, where her nexu was. She didn\u2019t have any dogs.</p><p>\u201cNel? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to fix it. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Everything felt just faintly off, like the whole world was\nout of sync with itself. \u201cFix what?\u201d</p><p>With considerable effort, Nela stood and stared about, then\ngrabbed for Ahuska\u2019s hand to pull her over to the far end of the alley. A\ntowering, graffiti riddled wall dominated the intersection, forcing beings to\neither turn hard left, hard right, or go back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cThe wall? I\u2026 nnng. Ow.\u201d Ahuska turned and winced, grasping\nat her back. Something hurt there, she could swear there was something wedged\nbetween her shoulders, except her flailing hand couldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, hurry, I think it\u2019s going to kill him. We don\u2019t\nhave time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what? What am I supposed to fix?\u201d</p><p>Nela was kicking through the bags of rubbish that littered\nthe streets, or at least she was trying to, but her feet were passing through\neverything and she groaned with frustration. \u201cYou need to draw. Pick that up, I\ncan\u2019t. You\u2019re more here than I am.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska stooped to pick up the piece of chalk Nela indicated,\nfeeling more confused by the moment. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry! Draw Meatballs\u2026 the- the wolf. Right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw him there! On the wall, you have to make him point to\nthe right.\u201d</p><p>Ahuska walked up to the wall as though in a haze, doing as\nNela bid. She drew hastily, a very quick and crude rendition of the animal,\nbecause she really wanted to go back and see if the girl was okay. She worried\nabout her.</p><p>This was a very odd little dream she was having.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran woke to pain, aches all over, a splitting headache\nand some new searing sensation in his jaw. He rolled across the floor, some\nexternal force shoving him away. He tried to ask what was going on, but it hurt\nto move his mouth. He was kicked again, rolling a little further along the\nfloor.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and it was unbridled fury that stared\nhim in the face. Crow was seething, snarling, itching to continue his assault.\nNines stood behind him, fists clenched, with only Lyrisal\u2019s hand on her\nshoulder keeping her at bay. And Ahuska had placed herself protectively between\nhim and Nela, glaring at him with all the ferocity of a mother wolf.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/425d3fb092a80a90db3c3d09188889ad/tumblr_inline_pbhzc1HW1p1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-width=\"1004\"></figure><p>\u201cYou call this TEACHING!?\u201d Crow roared. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to\nbe <i>helping her</i>, not sneaking onto my\nship and doing\u2026 whatever the feth that was\u2026!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ulfran strained to find his voice, to defend himself,\nwhile his mind still reeled from what he\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>\u201cDad, leave him alone, i-it was my fault, please\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, Nel.\u201d Ahuska tried to soothe her. Waking up to the\nsound of Nela\u2019s screams and Crow\u2019s bellowing had shaken her, and seeing her\nsitting there with Ulfran, both of them transfixed and frozen, had been even\nmore rattling.</p><p>Crow had not reacted particularly gracefully. Lurching off the\ncouch in a barely woken state, he didn\u2019t hesitate to take a swing at the man,\nbut it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect. Nela was still screaming, her hand\nwrapped around his wrist, and he tried to pry her fingers free to no avail. \u201cLET\nHER GO, YOU FETHIN\u2019 DIRTY SITH BASTARD!\u201d he\u2019d shouted, and somewhere from the\ndepths of his trance Ulfran had wheezed out a pained response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to help her, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.\u201d Crow had begun\nhis assault in earnest, and nothing was going to stop him freeing Nela.</p><p>It was to this that Ahuska had woken from her strange dream,\njust moments before Nela\u2019s own eyes burst open, and the girl reeled back with a\ngasp while Crow moved in to kick Ulfran away, forcing distance between himself\nand his daughter.</p><p>Ulfran tried to set his thoughts straight. Tried to ground\nhimself back in reality. They were all staring at him; Crow, Ahuska and Nines\nwere furious, Lyrisal blank-faced save the lift of a single questioning\neyebrow, and Nela, her eyes wide, haunted, confused, having just been through\nit all with him but having an even harder time making sense of it all.</p><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s okay, Ulfran. I think we\u2026 fixed it\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cQUIET,\u00a0 Nel,\u201d Crow interrupted, still glaring daggers at Ulfran.<br></p><p>Ulfran cringed back, lowering his head. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going.\u201d He\nknew he wasn\u2019t going to be able to explain what had happened in a hurry. He\ncould barely speak, and none of them seemed to be in the mood to listen. He\nhurt, everywhere, and knew he had to get out.</p><p>Ulfran fled Crow\u2019s ship, and Nela\u2019s family crowded around\nher. He felt the savage heat of their love for one another as he staggered away\nacross the cold sand.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran made himself scarce, the next few days. He didn\u2019t\nwant to draw more ire upon himself, and his fractured jaw needed rest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nalso had a terrible amount of thinking to do.\n\n\n\n</p><p>He spent a great deal of time in meditation, and actively\navoided contact with the Deserters.</p><p>It was Nela who eventually came to him, one morning,\ntrotting over as he was headed toward the medical barracks, both for his own check-up and\nto see how the other patients were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly, reaching out to just briefly\ntouch his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI went chasing after things I\nshouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept we had to,\u201d she stated. \u201cAhuska had to draw the\nwolf.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran paused his step, and he shot Nela a very odd look. It\nwas too much for him to wrap his head around, trying to sort what had been\nreal, or if any had been at all. Had they truly changed things? Had the reality\nthey\u2019d known actually been in any danger, had they needed to go back and fix\nthings to increase the odds of Crow turning right? Had they undone time, had\nthey always been living in an altered version of events\u2026? What had they\nactually experienced? He had no answers. He couldn\u2019t accept it as simply as\nNela seemed to. But his urgency to locate and destroy the shard had been\nrekindled, because his twisting, hopeless over-thinking always wound up leading\nto a single conclusion. That power, if it was real, was something no being\nshould ever wield.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not so mad any more. I tried to explain why it was\nso important, and that it was\u2026 all my fault. Dad doesn\u2019t actually want me to\nstop learning from you. We just\u2026 scared them all a bit.\u201d</p><p>Ulfran stared at her a long while. In the timeline where\nCrow had turned left, everything had fallen apart at the end, because there had\nbeen no trust. No love between them. But here, now, in the timeline where Crow had\ngone the right way\u2026 maybe they were in with a fighting chance.</p><p>\u201cNela,\u201d he started, speaking as softly as he had to to avoid\nexcessive pain rioting through his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize what an important person your father is?\u201d</p><p>\n\nNela stared at him as though he\u2019d said something utterly daft. \u201cWell\nof course he is, dummy. What in the universe could ever be more important than\nyour family?\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>",

Some\nobjects were displayed in shining cabinets, some on their own pedestals, others\nyet contained within energy fields.</p><p>The sound that Ulfran at the sight of the room and its\ncontents bordered on lustful.</p><p>Ahuska&rsquo;a snickered and jabbed a clawed finger into his side.\n&ldquo;Nerd.&rdquo;</p><p>Kassandra&rsquo;s eyes roved the artifacts desperately, not\nknowing what to look for yet still determined to beat them to it. She had no\nplans for beyond that, merely a vague hope that somehow possessing the Shard\nwould grant her the ability to out-do the callous Sith and the cruel Bothan.</p><p>&ldquo;So? Which one is it&hellip;?&rdquo; Ahuska&rsquo;a needled Ulfran, not wanting\nto wait a moment longer. </p><p>&ldquo;I need a moment,&rdquo; he lied. He&rsquo;d spotted the Shard almost\nimmediately, over to the far left of the room. But he&rsquo;d never described the\nartifact to Ahuska&rsquo;a, never let on that he knew exactly what to search for.\nBecause as much as he&rsquo;d enjoyed her brutish company in accomplishing his goal,\nhe certainly didn&rsquo;t trust her.</p><p>Ulfran prowled the room, his hungry eyes taking it all in.\nSome items he recognized immediately, others he could only make educated\nguesses, and he immediately wished he&rsquo;d come better prepared to take more. </p><p>The others followed, stepping softly across the pristine\nfloor. Three sets of guarded, glimmering red eyes probed the collection of\ntreasures. Ahuska&rsquo;a noted the way Ulfran veered well clear of a sizeable stone\npyramid, settled on a high pedestal behind \na glittering orange field. Ulfran noted the way Kassandra watched them\nboth like a wary prey beast, the way she seemed coiled and tense, ready to dart\nat any moment. The tension in the room was stifling.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, Ulfran worked his way over to a dagger\nthat was arranged artfully on a fold of silk, behind a mere wall of glass.\nNothing like the roughly cut crystal the others were half expecting to find,\nbut he knew it was there, forged into the blade, disguised long before it would\nhave fallen into Ronan Ve&rsquo;lora&rsquo;s hands. He wondered if he could take it\nsomehow, make it look like a passing whim, a secondary prize while he sought\nout the &lsquo;real&rsquo; shard&hellip;</p><p>But his gaze lingered on it a little too long. Ahuska&rsquo;a and\nKassandra both guessed at what the dagger must be, and Kassandra moved like\nlightning. Only to be struck by lightning. She grabbed an ornamental scepter\nfrom a rack by the wall, swinging it into the glass cabinet that guarded the\nweapon, and in the next hearbeat Ulfran thrust her away with a liberal\nthundering of the Force. Electrical charges surged through her body and she\nwrithed on the floor, seething.</p><p>With the shard&rsquo;s casing now in pieces on the floor, Ulfran\nreached for the dagger, and nothing could compare to the &nbsp;heady satisfaction that welled up inside him\nto finally possess what he had chased for so long. It was his. <i>It was his!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Bit much, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; Ahuska&rsquo;a &nbsp;sidled up to him, motioning toward the prone\nKassandra with a tilt of her snout.</p><p>Ulfran sidestepped away from her with a sneer, and a\nfiercely possessive glint in his scarlet eyes.</p><p>She watched him warily, her own eyes narrowing slowly,\nfingers toying with the switch on her whip. &ldquo;Come on then. That&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?\nLet&rsquo;s get out of here&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Still Ulfran hesitated. Suddenly, the thought of letting\nanyone else utilise the shard was abhorrent.</p><p>A moment of hurt flashed across Ahuska&rsquo;a&rsquo;s expression as she\nsaw that change come upon him, and then there was naught but fury in her eyes.\n&ldquo;Ulfran. We did this together. What makes you think you can get a-&ldquo;</p><p>But her sentence was cut short as a blast of the Force\npropelled her backward, crashing into an electrified field that flung her to\nthe ground, shaking violently. &ldquo;Chakaar,&rdquo; she cursed at him in her native\ntongue, fighting to regain her breath and find her feet.</p><p>But he was already darting away from her, intent on his\nexit, only to have his feet swept out from under him as Kassandra swung that\nscepter again, completely unexpectedly from behind the cabinet she&rsquo;d crawled over\nto, unnoticed. He swore colourfully as he fell, slamming into a marble pedestal\nthat rocked lazily before it, too, toppled to the ground, yet still he clutched\nthe dagger&hellip; at least, until a flash of red flicked out from where Ahuska&rsquo;a\nstaggered to her feet, lashing at his hand with her whip.</p><p>She had it set searingly hot; Ulfran&rsquo;s voice and breath were\nboth knocked out of him as the knife dropped to the ground, along with half of\nhis hand. All colour drained from his cheeks, his eyes went wide with rage and\nshock, and he channeled every bit of that pain into the rending Force thrust\nthat he directed at the two women who both dove for the dagger as it skittered\nacross the floor.</p><p>Kassandra cried out sharply at the cutting wind that tore at\nher, curling in on herself and turning away from the source of the blast that\nmade her feel as though her skin was going to be torn off. But Ahuska&rsquo;a&hellip; she\nsnarled, facing into it, flinging her arms forward with a firm and throaty &ldquo;<i>NO</i>.&rdquo; And she was just as surprised as\nUlfran when he found himself flung bodily backward through the vault.</p><p>Breathing hard from the exertion, the Bothan lurched toward\nthe dagger unimpeded, and it was very nearly in her grasp&hellip; when Ulfran tugged\nit forward, gripping it artfully with the Force and sending it coasting through\nthe air toward him. </p><p>From which Kassandra snatched it before it could reach him.</p><p>Again that red glare flashed through the air, but Ahuska&rsquo;a&rsquo;s\naim was thrown out by the sudden distracting movement in the corner of her eye,\nand she had to leap to dodge that great stone pyramid as Ulfran lifted his\nburned, bloodied half-hand to send it sweeping through the air toward her. As\nit hit the ground with a heavy thud, Ahuska&rsquo;a then flung herself toward\nKassandra, not knowing how she could possibly win with the Sith now against\nher, but unwilling to back down. Even as she bore down on the Chiss, she saw\nhim lift his hands again, and the hunk of carved stone once more lifted into\nthe air. She lashed her whip but couldn&rsquo;t reach him&hellip; she bolted forward,\nenraged, throwing herself toward the pyramid and slamming bodily into it,\nforcing it back toward him.</p><p>As she hit it, the world spun and brilliant white light\nbloomed behind her eyes.</p><p>So unexpected was her action that Ulfran barely had the time\nto mouth &lsquo;no..!&rsquo; before both Ahuska and the stone slammed into him, and he too\nfelt his perception of the world grow slippery. He was completely unaware of\nKassandra following up behind Ahsuka&rsquo;a, operating purely on adrenaline, arm\nlifted high before it plunged down somewhere at the Bothan&rsquo;s back, delving the\ndagger deep into her.</p><p>The three were locked in place, with the stone pyramid\nbetween them.</p><p>Everything was white.</p><p>An endless expanse of white <i>nothing</i>.</p><p>Ulfran felt a horrid, overwhelming sense of vertigo, as he\ntried to get his bearings. Tried to find some way to ground himself. But he\nknew where he was; where they all must be. Trapped inside that object he had\nfeared to touch. A mind prison. Where was Nela?</p><p>No, wait&hellip;</p><p>Ulfran shook his head, nearly losing his balance as his head\nspun. Nela? Who was&hellip; &nbsp;no. Kassandra?\nAhuska? Who was he? <i>Which</i> was he? He\nhad fallen, fallen so far, and the version of him that had succumbed to power\nand desire was suddenly overwhelmingly aware of the one who had not, and the\nshame he felt was dizzying. What was going on? This wasn&rsquo;t real. This was just\na vision, just one of Nela&rsquo;s visions&hellip; no, no, he had the shard, <i>they had the shard</i>, he had to figure out\nhow to use it and fix things so that he could be that better version of himself,\nhe had to wake up, he&hellip;</p><p><i>Ulfran, I&rsquo;m scared!\nWhere are you??!</i> Nela&rsquo;s voice whipped through the blinding whiteness, and\nhe spun, but it all looked the same. Endless. Empty.</p><p><i>What is this! Where\nare we!?</i> Nines&hellip; no, Kassandra?</p><p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, we&rsquo;re trapped, let me try to find\nyou&hellip;!&rdquo; Ulfran shouted into the void, fearing that the expanse swallowed his\nvoice before any of the others could perceive it. &ldquo;Kriff,&rdquo; &nbsp;part of him fought hard for calm, told\nhimself he must rise above the panic. Part of him wanted to rage and thrash\nabout, set the endless white up in flames.</p><p><b>OH, HELLO.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!!</i></p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet! Be still! We&rsquo;re not alone in here!&rdquo; Ulfran had no\nidea if they could hear him, but somehow he was positive that that whatever was\nbehind that other voice could.</p><p><i>What is it!!?? Help,\nit&rsquo;s all around&hellip;!! Ulfran please, get us out..!</i></p><p><b>LOOK AT YOU ALL! SO\nLONG, I HAVE AWAITED A VESSEL. AND NOW I AM SPOILED FOR CHOICE!</b></p><p>Dread welled up inside him. What was happening? How had he\nand Nela shifted from observers to participants in this re-telling of time? Who\nthe kriff was Nela, and where the kriff was Kassandra with that dagger?</p><p><b>THE RULES OF TIME DO\nNOT APPLY HERE. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU FOR THIS BREACH.</b></p><p>Ulfran felt something, then. Like fingers of ice, crawling\nacross his skin. He jerked away and stared about, but there was nothing to see.</p><p><b>STRONG, BUT NOT AS\nSTRONG AS HER. SHE WILL SERVE BETTER.</b></p><p><i>Ulfran!! </i>Nela&rsquo;s\nthought-voice had raised to a shriek. <i>It&rsquo;s\ntrying to get me! I can&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how to get us out&hellip; aah!</i></p><p>Ulfran wrestled with himself, as part of him cast about\ndesperately with the Force, trying to get a sense of Kassandra or Ahuska&rsquo;a. To\nfind them, seize the shard, and maybe with its power manage to free himself and\ncontinue his mission. But the rest of him fought back fiercely, unwilling to\nlet half of his self simply abandon Nela to whatever fate, whatever long\nimprisoned being was now clawing for her. He would not leave her! Gathering himself\ntogether, Ulfran threw all reservations to the wind and flung himself through\nthe endless wasteland of the prison, giving in to the ethereal nature of the\nplace. He probed and reached with the Force, felt its ebb and flow, sought out\nthat dreadful, tickling cold attached to that smug, otherworldly voice. <i>The rules of time do not apply here</i>, it\nhad said. Something was broken, breached, not as it should be.</p><p>And as he searched, he found&hellip; Ahuska. No, Ahuska&rsquo;a. &nbsp;Her life force flickering, fading, as outside\nof the prison her physical body also began to fail, with the Tempus shard stuck\nfirm inside her. There was something particularly intangible about her, a\nshimmering aspect to her Force presence that Ulfran had never encountered\nbefore.</p><p><i>Help,</i> she called\nout with her mind<i>. I&rsquo;m lost. I need to&hellip;\nto fix&hellip; I need Crow. No. Mar&rsquo;an? Who is&hellip; oh help. I&rsquo;m lost, I don&rsquo;t know how-</i></p><p><i>ULFRAAANN!</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m coming, Nela! I&rsquo;m\ncoming! </i>Completely uncertain about what he was doing, operating in streams\nof the Force that were utterly unknown to him, Ulfran tried to sweep up\nAhuska&rsquo;a&rsquo;s presence and carry it with him as he rushed toward Nela&rsquo;s screams\nand that bitter, evil cold that threatened her.</p><p><i>Ulfran!</i></p><p>Something buffeted him to the side, a heavy blow that\nrattled him through and burned at the same time<i>. LET HER GO, YOU FETHIN&rsquo; DIRTY SITH BASTARD!!</i> Half of Ulfran knew\nthat voice, cringed at that voice roaring through his head, and his\nbewilderment only grew. How was he here!? Pain ruptured all over him, or echoes\nof pain, he knew about it, but only felt it distantly&hellip; he heard, or felt, or\nknew about a crack&hellip; his face? His jaw? Endlessly he was pummeled, sworn at,\nclawed at, and he tried in vain to shake Crow off while he sought out the being\nthat was wrapping its icy tendrils around Nela.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to help her, you idiot!&rdquo;</p><p>LIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.<i></i></p><p><i>LET ME GO! </i>Ulfran tried\nto ignore him, spread his presence thin and intangible as he came crashing\nthrough the smothering whiteness, hurling every bit of mental energy he had\ntoward the being that desired to use Nela to escape its imprisonment. <i>GET OFF HER! You will not have her!</i> He\ncouldn&rsquo;t fix a shape to the being he fought, only a vague sense of size, the\nidea of shimmering purple hues, a feeling of ancient bitterness and\nmalevolence. He felt the strength of his darker half joining the battle,\nmeeting the being with his own wrath and hateful fury.</p><p><i>You have to help fix\nthis, Nela,</i> he shouted, prying her presence away and wrapping it up with\nthe Ahuska&rsquo;a&rsquo;s.</p><p>Suddenly it was as though the entirety of existence opened\nup in front of him. Oh, he&rsquo;d always known how powerfully the Force had flown\nthrough Nela, but now he <i>saw</i> it. He\nfelt it. And with his greater understanding and familiarity of its nature&hellip;\nwith Ahuska&rsquo;a&rsquo;s dying presence embedded with the power of that glittering\nshard&hellip; he knew what had to happen with absolute clarity.</p><p>As easily as swinging open an unlocked door, he made the way\nfor them, and gently pushed Nela and the Bothan through. <i>Help her fix this.</i></p><p>The way closed, and icy daggers thrust through him. <b>THIEF. I WILL END YOU AND THEN I WILL TAKE\nHER.</b></p><p><i>LIKE FETHIN&rsquo; HELL YOU\nWILL!</i> The fight was joined by Kassandra, hurtling through, her essence a\nwild and formless mess of fury, unable to contain the raw emotion she felt with\nany sense of shape or scale. She simply was, and she was pissed, and she didn&rsquo;t\nlike this thing all in her space.</p><p><i>BRING ME BACK MY STARS\nDAMNED DAUGHTER.</i></p><p><b>YOU ARE MINE.</b></p><p>Ulfran knew nothing but pain. He fought desperately to free\nhimself, and every tendril he tore out was new agony. His spirit was being torn\napart while his body, somewhere, distantly, was being battered. All he had was the hope that Nela would know what to do.</p><p>***</p><p>Ahuska stood on the dirty pavement of a grimy alleyway in\nthe Coruscant undercity. Nela was there, hunched and whimpering, holding her\nhead the way she did when she had her episodes.</p><p>She felt strange, light, and wondered where her dogs were.\nNo, where her nexu was. She didn&rsquo;t have any dogs.</p><p>&ldquo;Nel? Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You need to fix it. I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Everything felt just faintly off, like the whole world was\nout of sync with itself. &ldquo;Fix what?&rdquo;</p><p>With considerable effort, Nela stood and stared about, then\ngrabbed for Ahuska&rsquo;s hand to pull her over to the far end of the alley. A\ntowering, graffiti riddled wall dominated the intersection, forcing beings to\neither turn hard left, hard right, or go back the way they&rsquo;d come.</p><p>&ldquo;The wall? I&hellip; nnng. Ow.&rdquo; Ahuska turned and winced, grasping\nat her back. Something hurt there, she could swear there was something wedged\nbetween her shoulders, except her flailing hand couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, hurry, I think it&rsquo;s going to kill him. We don&rsquo;t\nhave time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Time for what? What am I supposed to fix?&rdquo;</p><p>Nela was kicking through the bags of rubbish that littered\nthe streets, or at least she was trying to, but her feet were passing through\neverything and she groaned with frustration. &ldquo;You need to draw. Pick that up, I\ncan&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re more here than I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahuska stooped to pick up the piece of chalk Nela indicated,\nfeeling more confused by the moment. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hurry! Draw Meatballs&hellip; the- the wolf. Right there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Draw him there! On the wall, you have to make him point to\nthe right.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahuska walked up to the wall as though in a haze, doing as\nNela bid. She drew hastily, a very quick and crude rendition of the animal,\nbecause she really wanted to go back and see if the girl was okay. She worried\nabout her.</p><p>This was a very odd little dream she was having.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran woke to pain, aches all over, a splitting headache\nand some new searing sensation in his jaw. He rolled across the floor, some\nexternal force shoving him away. He tried to ask what was going on, but it hurt\nto move his mouth. He was kicked again, rolling a little further along the\nfloor.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and it was unbridled fury that stared\nhim in the face. Crow was seething, snarling, itching to continue his assault.\nNines stood behind him, fists clenched, with only Lyrisal&rsquo;s hand on her\nshoulder keeping her at bay. And Ahuska had placed herself protectively between\nhim and Nela, glaring at him with all the ferocity of a mother wolf.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/425d3fb092a80a90db3c3d09188889ad/tumblr_inline_pbhzc1HW1p1r7lcd9_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;You call this TEACHING!?&rdquo; Crow roared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to\nbe <i>helping her</i>, not sneaking onto my\nship and doing&hellip; whatever the feth that was&hellip;!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Ulfran strained to find his voice, to defend himself,\nwhile his mind still reeled from what he&rsquo;d just experienced.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, leave him alone, i-it was my fault, please&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, Nel.&rdquo; Ahuska tried to soothe her. Waking up to the\nsound of Nela&rsquo;s screams and Crow&rsquo;s bellowing had shaken her, and seeing her\nsitting there with Ulfran, both of them transfixed and frozen, had been even\nmore rattling.</p><p>Crow had not reacted particularly gracefully. Lurching off the\ncouch in a barely woken state, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate to take a swing at the man,\nbut it didn&rsquo;t seem to have any effect. Nela was still screaming, her hand\nwrapped around his wrist, and he tried to pry her fingers free to no avail. &ldquo;LET\nHER GO, YOU FETHIN&rsquo; DIRTY SITH BASTARD!&rdquo; he&rsquo;d shouted, and somewhere from the\ndepths of his trance Ulfran had wheezed out a pained response.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to help her, you idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;LIKE HELL YOU ARE. LET GO OF MY DAUGHTER.&rdquo; Crow had begun\nhis assault in earnest, and nothing was going to stop him freeing Nela.</p><p>It was to this that Ahuska had woken from her strange dream,\njust moments before Nela&rsquo;s own eyes burst open, and the girl reeled back with a\ngasp while Crow moved in to kick Ulfran away, forcing distance between himself\nand his daughter.</p><p>Ulfran tried to set his thoughts straight. Tried to ground\nhimself back in reality. They were all staring at him; Crow, Ahuska and Nines\nwere furious, Lyrisal blank-faced save the lift of a single questioning\neyebrow, and Nela, her eyes wide, haunted, confused, having just been through\nit all with him but having an even harder time making sense of it all.</p><p>&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s okay, Ulfran. I think we&hellip; fixed it&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;QUIET,&nbsp; Nel,&rdquo; Crow interrupted, still glaring daggers at Ulfran.<br /></p><p>Ulfran cringed back, lowering his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; going.&rdquo; He\nknew he wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to explain what had happened in a hurry. He\ncould barely speak, and none of them seemed to be in the mood to listen. He\nhurt, everywhere, and knew he had to get out.</p><p>Ulfran fled Crow&rsquo;s ship, and Nela&rsquo;s family crowded around\nher. He felt the savage heat of their love for one another as he staggered away\nacross the cold sand.</p><p>***</p><p>Ulfran made himself scarce, the next few days. He didn&rsquo;t\nwant to draw more ire upon himself, and his fractured jaw needed rest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe\nalso had a terrible amount of thinking to do.\n\n\n\n</p><p>He spent a great deal of time in meditation, and actively\navoided contact with the Deserters.</p><p>It was Nela who eventually came to him, one morning,\ntrotting over as he was headed toward the medical barracks, both for his own check-up and\nto see how the other patients were.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said quietly, reaching out to just briefly\ntouch his hand. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would go like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I went chasing after things I\nshouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except we had to,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;Ahuska had to draw the\nwolf.&rdquo;</p><p>Ulfran paused his step, and he shot Nela a very odd look. It\nwas too much for him to wrap his head around, trying to sort what had been\nreal, or if any had been at all. Had they truly changed things? Had the reality\nthey&rsquo;d known actually been in any danger, had they needed to go back and fix\nthings to increase the odds of Crow turning right? Had they undone time, had\nthey always been living in an altered version of events&hellip;? What had they\nactually experienced? He had no answers. He couldn&rsquo;t accept it as simply as\nNela seemed to. But his urgency to locate and destroy the shard had been\nrekindled, because his twisting, hopeless over-thinking always wound up leading\nto a single conclusion. That power, if it was real, was something no being\nshould ever wield.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not so mad any more. I tried to explain why it was\nso important, and that it was&hellip; all my fault. Dad doesn&rsquo;t actually want me to\nstop learning from you. We just&hellip; scared them all a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Ulfran stared at her a long while. In the timeline where\nCrow had turned left, everything had fallen apart at the end, because there had\nbeen no trust. No love between them. But here, now, in the timeline where Crow had\ngone the right way&hellip; maybe they were in with a fighting chance.</p><p>&ldquo;Nela,&rdquo; he started, speaking as softly as he had to to avoid\nexcessive pain rioting through his jaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you realize what an important person your father is?&rdquo;</p><p>\n\nNela stared at him as though he&rsquo;d said something utterly daft. &ldquo;Well\nof course he is, dummy. What in the universe could ever be more important than\nyour family?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

He should want to see her smiling and happy \u2014 and he <i>does</i> want that, too, but it doesn\u2019t efface the darkness he wants to share with her. The way he knows the shadow in his heart would love to see her tied up on her knees before him, gazing up at him with eyes full of tears and rapture.</p>\n<p>\n  <i>Fuck.</i>\n</p>\n<p>He forces his body\u2019s clamoring desires to quiet and then leaps to his feet, pacing out his agitation. His mind whirls like a maelstrom, blinding him to his own workshop. He can\u2019t just approach her and ask her out, he\u2019d look like a complete creep \u2014 but maybe there\u2019s a way of forcing their paths to converge, like twisting two broken ends of wire together.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dangerous to think of manipulating her and then demanding her trust, her honesty.

It might be that this is due to a lack of information on Leia&rsquo;s adoptive parents at the time it was written. \n I, therefore,\ntook the liberty to\n make a little change in order to correct that.&nbsp;</p><p>In the fic, Bail Organa&rsquo;s wife - and, hence, \nLeia&rsquo;s adoptive mother - is supposed to be Sach&eacute; <strike>Organa</strike>, a former handmaiden of Padm&eacute; Amidala, instead of Breha Organa (who doesn&rsquo;t exist there). This wouldn&rsquo;t pose much of a problem, since you could just resort to switching the name in your head &hellip; were it not for the fact that Sach&eacute;&rsquo;s death later in the story (sorry for the spoiler) was a very important factor for the plot. However that may be - we know quite well that the canon Breha Organa, \non the other hand, survived until the destruction of Alderaan in ANH.</p><p>To solve this I mentally split these two in the fic - with both existing in it. <br /></p><p>Breha as Leia&rsquo;s actual adoptive mother, and Sach&eacute; being the Organas&rsquo; aide, and a governess and teacher to the young princess - something I consider quite likely, given it seems a natural choice for the Organas to hire a former handmaiden and confidante of Padm&eacute; Amidala to help raising the latters&rsquo; daughter - also as a means to preserve her legacy and memory.</p><p>I imagine Sach&eacute; being really close to both Bail and Breha (all of them being old friends of Padm&eacute;, and common members of the Rebel Alliance), as well as Leia - who almost considers her as a second mother, and a close friend.</p><p>\nThat way, it works with both the established, as well as the fic-verse canon. Breha lives on, but we can still have the tragic impact that Sach&eacute;&rsquo;s demise has on both Leia herself (plus the furthering of her dedication to the Alliance), as well as providing the pivotal moment to spell doom on her former friendly relations to Darth Vader. <br /></p><p>[ <i>Sach&eacute; was killed in a raid of a rebel meeting, by troopers that were under the command of Vader - who wasn&rsquo;t present at that time, and who would definitely have prevented it if he had been, as he a) wasn&rsquo;t even aware she took part in the meeting, and b) never meant to harm her regardless (she was also one of his friends once) - therefore he deeply regretted what happened upon finding out when he arrived.
