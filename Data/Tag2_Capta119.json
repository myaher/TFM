        "body": "<p>Earlier this week, a made a post wherein a linked a youtube video I had found that did a good job with summarising my own position regarding the Rotten Tomatoes controversy involving the removal of the\u00a0\u2018don\u2019t want to see\u2019 option.</p><p><a href=\"https://jolleiq.tumblr.com/post/183074679412/i-wanted-to-make-a-post-of-my-own-but-randomly\">https://jolleiq.tumblr.com/post/183074679412/i-wanted-to-make-a-post-of-my-own-but-randomly</a><br/></p><p>As a response, the user <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIAij2OIcXYcpCy5_XBWhAw\">@hug-annoy</a> pointed out the following (cropped for clarity reasons, you can find the original under the link above but I\u2019ve left nothing out):</p><figure data-orig-width=\"517\" data-orig-height=\"370\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8462bc065c2420dad9d38b2aa4c844a/tumblr_inline_pnpcakDVxz1urqfbo_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"517\" data-orig-height=\"370\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"501\" data-orig-height=\"370\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08c191a06e35c345cbc0eac784090438/tumblr_inline_pnpcapR0xq1urqfbo_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"501\" data-orig-height=\"370\"/></figure><p>Along with their argument, the user provided me with a link to the following article:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/tv-and-film/brie-larson-641750#IGBy6mWlbqbT5ZGZ.99\">https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/tv-and-film/brie-larson-641750#IGBy6mWlbqbT5ZGZ.99</a></p><p>I would like to take this response as an opportunity to show what I mean when I say that one should always read everything carefully and never leave out important pieces of information, as well as read the words themselves with care.</p><p>Let me start off by completing the statement above:</p><p><i> \u201cAbout a year ago, I started paying attention to what my press days looked like and the critics reviewing movies, and noticed it appeared to be overwhelmingly white male. So, I spoke to Dr Stacy Smith at the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, who put together a study to confirm that. Moving forward, I decided to make sure my press days were more inclusive. After speaking with you, the film critic Valerie Complex and a few other women of colour, it sounded like across the board they weren\u2019t getting the same opportunities as others. <b>When I talked to the facilities that weren\u2019t providing it, they all had different excuses</b>.\u201d</i><br/></p><p>I\u2019ll comment about this in a minute, but for now, I would like everyone reading this to take a good 5 seconds and tell me why I found the last bit so important.</p><p>5&hellip;</p><p>4&hellip;</p><p>3&hellip;</p><p>2&hellip;</p><p>1&hellip;</p><p>Time\u2019s up! For those of you with a keen eye, you\u2019ll have noticed the word that gives away Brie\u2019s act lies at the very end of the sentence:\u00a0\u2018excuses.\u2019</p><p>Oh, but Mr. Bollywood! You\u2019re just being silly! It\u2019s just an ordinary word!</p><p>Well, yes, as a linguist, I agree, it is just an ordinary word. But it\u2019s not the word itself that is problematic, but rather the specific use of that specific word in that specific sentence in that specific\u00a0context.</p><p>Let\u2019s play a little game called: Spot the difference!</p><p>S1: <i>When I talked to the facilities that weren\u2019t providing it, they all had different excuses. </i><br/></p><p>S2: <i>When I talked to the facilities that weren\u2019t providing it, they all had different reasons. </i><br/></p><p>A subtle difference to spot, but one that changes the meaning entirely. The second is simply an observation and a valid position, but the first has an implicit negative connotation. It\u2019s difficult to spot and I can\u2019t really blame anyone for not spotting it, but with the implicit negative connotation that Brie assigned to the sentence, she revealed her inner bias. She wasn\u2019t interested in hearing the reasons as to why the majority of film critics were white males, she was specifically looking for excuses, meaning that she had already decided that no matter the answer, every answer was just an excuse and not a valid reason. Unfortunately for her, some people do spot this, and those people can tell when someone is looking to fight for justice or fight for an agenda, and she made it clear that she is doing the latter. If you go out looking for excuses, you\u2019ll find excuses, and if you go out looking for reasons, you\u2019ll find reasons, the key difference being the excuses will always have a negative connotation, whereas reasons could be both good and bad.</p><p>As for the other part, I tracked it down to this article:\u00a0<a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/02/11/brie-larson-doubles-down-wants-fewer-white-men-on-captain-marvel-press-tour/\">https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/02/11/brie-larson-doubles-down-wants-fewer-white-men-on-captain-marvel-press-tour/</a></p><p>Again, let\u2019s play a game of spot the difference!\u00a0</p><p><i><i>S1: \u201cFor the third time, I don\u2019t hate black dudes. These are just facts. These are not my feelings. Am I saying I hate black dudes? No, I am not. What I am saying is you make a movie that is a love letter to white men, there is an insanely low chance a white man will have a chance to see your movie, and review your movie.\u201d</i> <br/></i></p><p><i>S2:\u00a0 <i>\u201cFor the third time, I don\u2019t hate white dudes. These are just facts. These are not my feelings. Am I saying I hate white dudes? No, I am not. What I am saying is you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will have a chance to see your movie, and review your movie.\u201d</i> </i></p><p><i><i>S1 \u201cI don\u2019t need a 40-year-old black woman to tell me what didn\u2019t work about Captain America. It wasn\u2019t made for her! I want to know what it meant to white men, biracial boys, to teen boys.\u201d</i><br/></i></p><p><i><i>S2:\u00a0 <i>\u201cI don\u2019t need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn\u2019t work about A Wrinkle in Time. It wasn\u2019t made for him! I want to know what it meant to women of color, biracial women, to teen women of color, to teens that are biracial.\u201c </i> </i></i></p><p>It\u2019s amazing how replacing a few words can turn a whole paragraph on its head, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>All poor jokes aside, I agree that the numbers of film critics are disproportionate, but rather than look for excuses, look for reasons and then evaluate those reasons.</p><p>Had Brie replaced\u00a0\u2018white male\u2019 with any other word, the social media would have bombarded her, but they didn\u2019t, because as long as it is a white male that is in the bad spotlight, it\u2019s okay, and this is the problem I am trying to point out and why I called her racist and sexist, as well as why so many are outraged. The narrative that is being pushed to stop racism and sexism is itself sexist and racist, and I stand against this.</p><p>Has she phrased it as:\u00a0\u201cI wish to make my press tour more inclusive to give every reporter, regardless of gender or colour, an equal voice in the matter, and find out the reasons why there is such a discrepancy between the number of reporters who are white men and those who are not, to find out whether there exists some barrier preventing others from attaining such positions, or if there are valid reasons for it,\u201d she would have gotten my and many other\u2019s full support, because this is what being a progressive and being all-inclusive is. But when you single out a particular group of people and give advantage to all others, and see any reason as just an excuse, that\u2019s when you\u2019re being biassed and prejudiced.</p><p>Also, why does it matter who the film is made for or who reviews it? The movie should not be judged by whether or not it met the desires of a specific audience, but it should be judged by itself and whether it was good or not. Yes, you can make it for a specific audience and value their opinions more highly than others\u2019, that\u2019s fine, but if I happen to watch the movie and not like certain aspects of it, telling me that my voice doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m not a specific skin colour or sex is both racist and sexist <b><i>by definition</i></b>. Were I to pull the same thing as I jokingly did above, I\u2019d receive a wave of hate for being sexist and racist and prejudiced, but when someone else does it who isn\u2019t white or male, it\u2019s ok.</p><p>\u201cYour opinion of A Wrinkle in Time doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re a white male.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYour opinion about Iron Man doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re a black woman.\u201d<br/></p><p>I see no difference in the two. Both are equally sexist and racist, and that\u2019s what Brie and the media backing her refuse to understand. Even if the movie wasn\u2019t made specifically for me, I can still like or dislike it and I have the full right to comment on it, as do other people about other movies.

You&rsquo;re just being silly! It&rsquo;s just an ordinary word!</p><p>Well, yes, as a linguist, I agree, it is just an ordinary word. But it&rsquo;s not the word itself that is problematic, but rather the specific use of that specific word in that specific sentence in that specific&nbsp;context.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s play a little game called: Spot the difference!</p><p>S1: <i>When I talked to the facilities that weren&rsquo;t providing it, they all had different excuses. </i><br /></p><p>S2: <i>When I talked to the facilities that weren&rsquo;t providing it, they all had different reasons. </i><br /></p><p>A subtle difference to spot, but one that changes the meaning entirely. The second is simply an observation and a valid position, but the first has an implicit negative connotation. It&rsquo;s difficult to spot and I can&rsquo;t really blame anyone for not spotting it, but with the implicit negative connotation that Brie assigned to the sentence, she revealed her inner bias. She wasn&rsquo;t interested in hearing the reasons as to why the majority of film critics were white males, she was specifically looking for excuses, meaning that she had already decided that no matter the answer, every answer was just an excuse and not a valid reason. Unfortunately for her, some people do spot this, and those people can tell when someone is looking to fight for justice or fight for an agenda, and she made it clear that she is doing the latter. If you go out looking for excuses, you&rsquo;ll find excuses, and if you go out looking for reasons, you&rsquo;ll find reasons, the key difference being the excuses will always have a negative connotation, whereas reasons could be both good and bad.</p><p>As for the other part, I tracked it down to this article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/02/11/brie-larson-doubles-down-wants-fewer-white-men-on-captain-marvel-press-tour/\">https://boundingintocomics.com/2019/02/11/brie-larson-doubles-down-wants-fewer-white-men-on-captain-marvel-press-tour/</a></p><p>Again, let&rsquo;s play a game of spot the difference!&nbsp;</p><p><i><i>S1: &ldquo;For the third time, I don&rsquo;t hate black dudes. These are just facts. These are not my feelings. Am I saying I hate black dudes? No, I am not. What I am saying is you make a movie that is a love letter to white men, there is an insanely low chance a white man will have a chance to see your movie, and review your movie.&rdquo;</i> <br /></i></p><p><i>S2:&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;For the third time, I don&rsquo;t hate white dudes. These are just facts. These are not my feelings. Am I saying I hate white dudes? No, I am not. What I am saying is you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will have a chance to see your movie, and review your movie.&rdquo;</i> </i></p><p><i><i>S1 &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a 40-year-old black woman to tell me what didn&rsquo;t work about Captain America. It wasn&rsquo;t made for her! I want to know what it meant to white men, biracial boys, to teen boys.&rdquo;</i><br /></i></p><p><i><i>S2:&nbsp; <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn&rsquo;t work about A Wrinkle in Time. It wasn&rsquo;t made for him! I want to know what it meant to women of color, biracial women, to teen women of color, to teens that are biracial.&ldquo; </i> </i></i></p><p>It&rsquo;s amazing how replacing a few words can turn a whole paragraph on its head, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>All poor jokes aside, I agree that the numbers of film critics are disproportionate, but rather than look for excuses, look for reasons and then evaluate those reasons.</p><p>Had Brie replaced&nbsp;&lsquo;white male&rsquo; with any other word, the social media would have bombarded her, but they didn&rsquo;t, because as long as it is a white male that is in the bad spotlight, it&rsquo;s okay, and this is the problem I am trying to point out and why I called her racist and sexist, as well as why so many are outraged. The narrative that is being pushed to stop racism and sexism is itself sexist and racist, and I stand against this.</p><p>Has she phrased it as:&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish to make my press tour more inclusive to give every reporter, regardless of gender or colour, an equal voice in the matter, and find out the reasons why there is such a discrepancy between the number of reporters who are white men and those who are not, to find out whether there exists some barrier preventing others from attaining such positions, or if there are valid reasons for it,&rdquo; she would have gotten my and many other&rsquo;s full support, because this is what being a progressive and being all-inclusive is. But when you single out a particular group of people and give advantage to all others, and see any reason as just an excuse, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re being biassed and prejudiced.</p><p>Also, why does it matter who the film is made for or who reviews it? The movie should not be judged by whether or not it met the desires of a specific audience, but it should be judged by itself and whether it was good or not. Yes, you can make it for a specific audience and value their opinions more highly than others&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s fine, but if I happen to watch the movie and not like certain aspects of it, telling me that my voice doesn&rsquo;t matter because I&rsquo;m not a specific skin colour or sex is both racist and sexist <b><i>by definition</i></b>. Were I to pull the same thing as I jokingly did above, I&rsquo;d receive a wave of hate for being sexist and racist and prejudiced, but when someone else does it who isn&rsquo;t white or male, it&rsquo;s ok.</p><p>&ldquo;Your opinion of A Wrinkle in Time doesn&rsquo;t matter because you&rsquo;re a white male.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your opinion about Iron Man doesn&rsquo;t matter because you&rsquo;re a black woman.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>I see no difference in the two. Both are equally sexist and racist, and that&rsquo;s what Brie and the media backing her refuse to understand. Even if the movie wasn&rsquo;t made specifically for me, I can still like or dislike it and I have the full right to comment on it, as do other people about other movies. That&rsquo;s how equality works.</p><p>I hope I&rsquo;ve made my position clear this time.</p><p>- B. S.</p>",

Moving forward, users will not be able to comment on a film prior to the film\u2019s release. This new change should prevent users from posting negative reviews about a movie prior to it being released to give it a false score.</p>\n<p>This move came shortly after Internet Trolls started to comment on Captain Marvel\u2019s Rotten Tomatoes page and giving it negative feedback. This \u201cReview-Bombing\u201d was to purposefully lower the film\u2019s Audience Rating. As a result, the film is currently the lowest-rated MCU film on the website.</p>\n<p>Shazam!

Moving forward, users will not be able to comment on a film prior to the film&rsquo;s release.

This &ldquo;Review-Bombing&rdquo; was to purposefully lower the film&rsquo;s Audience Rating. As a result, the film is currently the lowest-rated MCU film on the website.</p>\n<p>Shazam! Star Zachary Levi decided to confront the trolls head in an Instagram video where he tells people that &ldquo;This is not helping anyone or anything.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZacharyLevi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ZacharyLevi</a> asking fans to stop piting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaptainMarvel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CaptainMarvel</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shazam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Shazam</a> against each other, because IT ISN&rsquo;T HELPING ANYONE.
