Lyanna&rsquo;s boy or not, Jon was raised as his son, I&rsquo;m like 99% percent certain that the prospect of&nbsp;&ldquo;his son&rdquo; courting his daughter would appear extremely icky to him.</p><p>(I&rsquo;m all on board with the &ldquo;but they weren&rsquo;t close as children&rdquo; argument&ndash;they were indeed not, and them being once-siblings doesn&rsquo;t discourage me from shipping them&ndash;but I&rsquo;m trying to focus on Ned&rsquo;s perspective here.)</p><p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t believe he was talking directly about Jon. I cannot speak for all the Jonsas out there, but most of us don&rsquo;t believe that either. What we do believe is that it may have been a kinda sorta foreshadowing for Sansa, and that she will in fact be matched with&nbsp;&ldquo;a high lord who&rsquo;s worthy of [her], someone brave and gentle and strong&rdquo;, and that this&nbsp;&ldquo;someone&rdquo; will be Jon himself, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p><p>Has it been confirmed anywhere in the books? No. Has it been explicitly contradicted? Also no. Yes, we are looking for clues supporting our ships, BIG SURPRISE! Some of them are just wishful thinking, some of them may actually be proven right at some point. As far as&nbsp;&ldquo;wild theories&rdquo; are concerned, neither Jon being&nbsp;&ldquo;the match that was promised&rdquo;, nor the Good Queen Alysanne/Sansa parallels are extremely far-fetched.&nbsp;</p><p>Quoting Bridget Jones:&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, shall we?&rdquo; Ship and let ship. I wish you all good fortune in the wars to come!</p>",

He loved her more than he could bear. He loved her more than he would admit and could admit. Every time he looked at her, his heart skipped a beat. Every time he talked to her, he just wanted to lean back and listen. Every time he was with her, he forgot the rest of the underworld, the heavy weight on his shoulders, the calling of his duties.</p><p>And she loved him too. But despite her love for him, there was a certain unhappiness in her eyes, in her voice, in the way she walked around. She wasn\u2019t made to hide in the shadows and linger in the darkness. Just like a flower couldn\u2019t fully bloom in the cold snow.</p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon watched her full plate. </p><p>During the last half an hour she had barely eaten anything, apart from 6 small seeds from the pomegranate. Her cheeks had once been rosy and blushed, but the color was fading and only whiteness remained. </p><p>He loved her. He loved her more than he could bear. He loved her that much that seeing her withering away like this, shattered his heart into a thousand little pieces. \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Sansa looked up and her eyes widened. The sudden gleam that brightened them made a pleasant warmth spread through Jon\u2019s entire body. </p><p>\u201cTo Winterfell. To your mother. To your sister. To your brothers.\u201d He reached for her hand and he tried to warm her ice cold skin between his own palms. He was nothing without her. He had been nothing before they had met. And he would return to be nothing when she had left. But he couldn\u2019t keep her here, locked up and sealed away from the world she loved so much. </p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWould you come with me?\u201d She whispered. She loved him too. She loved him, but detested his world, his kingdom and his reign. How could he ever blame her? How could he blame the sun for hating the night?</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He bent his head, but his hands kept on holding onto hers. \u201cMy people need me. My kingdom needs me. If I\u2019m gone, there will be nothing but chaos.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips formed a straight line.</p><p>He remembered the first time he had seen her. </p><p>She had been climbing trees with her brothers. Higher and higher and higher, as if they had tried to reach the top of the Olympus, even though they were only demi-Gods and would never be allowed to enter. When she had almost gotten there she had fallen down, all the way to the ground. Her backbone had cracked, little bones in her body had broken and for a few short seconds her heart had stopped beating.</p><p>But even in death she had been beautiful. Despite her fall, she had smiled. She had smiled because she had attempted to reach one Goddamned place and had made it to another. She had told him about the irony in that and how even demi-Gods didn\u2019t seem to be free from the cruel games the Gods liked to play.</p><p>He had assured her he was not a cruel God. He was not playing games. And he had told her that her time hadn\u2019t come yet, that he would send her back to live a much longer life than the one she had already had.</p><p>But she had come back. She had jumped off the highest tower of Winterfell. She had drowned herself in the ice cold water of the melting snow after a terrible long winter. She had bled herself dry using her brother\u2019s sword. </p><p>And every time he had told her that it was not her time yet. That she had a much longer life to live and that he would sent her back to live it.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you\u2026\u201d She had whispered. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask for.\u201d He had answered. And he had let her go again.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I want is for you to be unhappy.\u201d Jon whispered and the tip of his finger draw circles on her ice cold skin. \u201cI never wanted you to be unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Jon had rarely left the Underworld. The underworld was his home, his kingdom. But he had made one exception once. He had saddled the horses all by himself to make sure no one knew he had gone. He had cracked open the earth, moving swiftly and quickly so he could close it again before anyone could notice the unusual light coming in. </p><p>Winterfell had prepared itself for the coming Winter at that time, but all the preparations had stopped when he had entered through the wide open gate. People had stared at him, Ned and Catelyn had rushed out of the castle with fear in their eyes. But he had assured them that he was simply here to ask for their daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. </p><p>And in that moment they had understood why their daughter had become reckless. Why Sansa had jumped off roofs and dove into ice cold water. In that moment they had understood that the God of the Underworld and the first born lady of Winterfell had fallen in love. </p><p>With tears in their eyes they had watched them leave. Jon had had his hand around her waist, holding her tightly, telling her to look over her shoulder to say goodbye to her family for as long as she could, because she would not see them again for a very long while. And Sansa had done so. But she had not cried. She had smiled. She had smiled because she could be with him and he could be with her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be unhappy for the rest of my life.\u201d Sansa sighed. \u201cIf I go home, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I won\u2019t be with you. If I stay, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I miss the burning sun and the holy tree blossoming.\u201d She pulled her hand back and bent her head. \u201cIt does seem that cruel Gods did play an evil game when they let me fall on that first day I met you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from his seat and walked towards her. Nothing he could do would truly comfort her. He knew that because he had tried, night after night and day after day. But he wrapped his arms around her anyway and he held her while tears rolled down her cheeks. \u201cYou can have it both.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot at the same time, but still.\u201d Jon rocked her back and forth in his arms. \u201cGo home during the spring- and summertime. Warm yourself in the sun, spend time with your parents and siblings, ride horses and feel the wind through your hair.\u201d He let his head rest on hers. \u201cAnd when Winter is coming you will return to me to rule by my side, to judge the souls that enter my realm, to love me and to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked up. Even with traces of salted tears on her cheeks she still looked beautiful. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d She stood up from her seat and cupped his face. Her lips brushed his, softly and gently and then fiercely and passionately. \u201cAnd I will think of you every day we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>Jon wiped her hair from her face and used his thumbs to wipe her tears away. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a minute I won\u2019t be thinking of you. But we have eternity. There is still plenty of time to love.&ldquo;</p>",

Every time he talked to her, he just wanted to lean back and listen. Every time he was with her, he forgot the rest of the underworld, the heavy weight on his shoulders, the calling of his duties.</p><p>And she loved him too. But despite her love for him, there was a certain unhappiness in her eyes, in her voice, in the way she walked around. She wasn\u2019t made to hide in the shadows and linger in the darkness.

Her cheeks had once been rosy and blushed, but the color was fading and only whiteness remained. </p><p>He loved her. He loved her more than he could bear. He loved her that much that seeing her withering away like this, shattered his heart into a thousand little pieces. \u201cDo you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d Sansa looked up and her eyes widened. The sudden gleam that brightened them made a pleasant warmth spread through Jon\u2019s entire body. </p><p>\u201cTo Winterfell. To your mother. To your sister. To your brothers.\u201d He reached for her hand and he tried to warm her ice cold skin between his own palms. He was nothing without her. He had been nothing before they had met. And he would return to be nothing when she had left. But he couldn\u2019t keep her here, locked up and sealed away from the world she loved so much. </p><p>Sansa shook her head. \u201cWould you come with me?\u201d She whispered. She loved him too. She loved him, but detested his world, his kingdom and his reign. How could he ever blame her? How could he blame the sun for hating the night?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He bent his head, but his hands kept on holding onto hers. \u201cMy people need me. My kingdom needs me. If I\u2019m gone, there will be nothing but chaos.\u201d </p><p>Sansa\u2019s lips formed a straight line.</p><p>He remembered the first time he had seen her. </p><p>She had been climbing trees with her brothers. Higher and higher and higher, as if they had tried to reach the top of the Olympus, even though they were only demi-Gods and would never be allowed to enter. When she had almost gotten there she had fallen down, all the way to the ground. Her backbone had cracked, little bones in her body had broken and for a few short seconds her heart had stopped beating.</p><p>But even in death she had been beautiful. Despite her fall, she had smiled. She had smiled because she had attempted to reach one Goddamned place and had made it to another. She had told him about the irony in that and how even demi-Gods didn\u2019t seem to be free from the cruel games the Gods liked to play.</p><p>He had assured her he was not a cruel God. He was not playing games. And he had told her that her time hadn\u2019t come yet, that he would send her back to live a much longer life than the one she had already had.</p><p>But she had come back. She had jumped off the highest tower of Winterfell. She had drowned herself in the ice cold water of the melting snow after a terrible long winter. She had bled herself dry using her brother\u2019s sword. </p><p>And every time he had told her that it was not her time yet. That she had a much longer life to live and that he would sent her back to live it.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you\u2026\u201d She had whispered. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask for.\u201d He had answered. And he had let her go again.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I want is for you to be unhappy.\u201d Jon whispered and the tip of his finger draw circles on her ice cold skin. \u201cI never wanted you to be unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Jon had rarely left the Underworld. The underworld was his home, his kingdom. But he had made one exception once. He had saddled the horses all by himself to make sure no one knew he had gone. He had cracked open the earth, moving swiftly and quickly so he could close it again before anyone could notice the unusual light coming in. </p><p>Winterfell had prepared itself for the coming Winter at that time, but all the preparations had stopped when he had entered through the wide open gate. People had stared at him, Ned and Catelyn had rushed out of the castle with fear in their eyes. But he had assured them that he was simply here to ask for their daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. </p><p>And in that moment they had understood why their daughter had become reckless. Why Sansa had jumped off roofs and dove into ice cold water. In that moment they had understood that the God of the Underworld and the first born lady of Winterfell had fallen in love. </p><p>With tears in their eyes they had watched them leave. Jon had had his hand around her waist, holding her tightly, telling her to look over her shoulder to say goodbye to her family for as long as she could, because she would not see them again for a very long while. And Sansa had done so. But she had not cried. She had smiled. She had smiled because she could be with him and he could be with her. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be unhappy for the rest of my life.\u201d Sansa sighed. \u201cIf I go home, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I won\u2019t be with you. If I stay, I\u2019ll be unhappy because I miss the burning sun and the holy tree blossoming.\u201d She pulled her hand back and bent her head. \u201cIt does seem that cruel Gods did play an evil game when they let me fall on that first day I met you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stood up from his seat and walked towards her. Nothing he could do would truly comfort her. He knew that because he had tried, night after night and day after day. But he wrapped his arms around her anyway and he held her while tears rolled down her cheeks. \u201cYou can have it both.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNot at the same time, but still.\u201d Jon rocked her back and forth in his arms. \u201cGo home during the spring- and summertime. Warm yourself in the sun, spend time with your parents and siblings, ride horses and feel the wind through your hair.\u201d He let his head rest on hers. \u201cAnd when Winter is coming you will return to me to rule by my side, to judge the souls that enter my realm, to love me and to make up for lost time.\u201d</p><p>Sansa looked up. Even with traces of salted tears on her cheeks she still looked beautiful. \u201cI love you, Jon Snow.\u201d She stood up from her seat and cupped his face. Her lips brushed his, softly and gently and then fiercely and passionately. \u201cAnd I will think of you every day we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>Jon wiped her hair from her face and used his thumbs to wipe her tears away. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a minute I won\u2019t be thinking of you. But we have eternity. There is still plenty of time to love.\u201c</p></p>",

        "body": "<p>Another chapter of my slow-burn /season 7 AU fic is up. Bran is setting up the pieces to prepare for the attack of the WW&hellip; Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/38525381\">AO3</a>. <br/></p><p>Bran\u2019s left\nhand touched Ghost, his right hand the weirwood. He nodded at his sisters. \u201cLet\nmy guards wake me occasionally to give me water and something to eat, but not\ntoo often. Our enemies are close, and I have work to do to fight them. My\nguards must protect me, when our enemies come. If they get me here, we are\nlost.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him unhappily. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you do that whatever it is you do in the\ncastle?\u201d</p><p>Bran just\nshook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay\nwith you,\u201d Arya said.</p><!-- more --><p>Bran shook\nhis head again. \u201cMeera stays with me. You know, what you have to do, Arya.\u201d</p><p>Arya bit\nher lip. \u201cNymeria is on her way, but she\u2019s still far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her\nhurry!\u201d </p><p>Sansa gave\ninstruction to the dozen knights that she had dispatched to guard her brother.\nShe had ordered them to take a bag of food each and now she placed one at\nBran\u2019s feet. With her face so close, Bran could see that her eyes were\nred-rimmed from crying, but listening to her giving orders to the knights,\ninstructing Podrick to give Bran water every three hours at the very least and\na bite to eat as well, Bran would never have thought that she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou go to\nthe castle,\u201d he encouraged her. \u201cThey will need the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>He made an\neffort to remember what would be expected of him. He took her hand, pressed it,\nand moved the muscles that made him smile. </p><p>\u201cWe have a\nchance. I know you will manage well. Send more people to guard me, once the\nWalkers come.\u201d</p><p>He rested\nhis hand on the direwolf\u2019s head again. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nknow when we need the wolves,\u201d he told Arya.</p><p>Bran knew\nthat he would look as if life had left him but sitting at the weirwood and\ndiving into the wisdom that awaited him was the only time he felt alive now. He\nknew that he was living other people\u2019s lives, that he felt other people\u2019s love\nand yet all that at the same time made him dizzy and hungry for more at the\nsame time. Knowledge and wisdom were his. It was a blessing and a burden. He\ncould try to act at the right time from what he knew, and yet he never had the\nfeeling he knew enough. His thirst could not be quenched and yet he had to\nwatch himself so that he would not drown. Meera eyed him, a worried look on her\nface. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve\ntalked about this. I\u2019ll manage,\u201d he told her. </p><p>The worry\ndid not leave her face, but he pushed that away and delved into the swirling\nimages that came when he touched the weirwood.</p><p>It was not\nthat difficult to get hold of Jon with Ghost by his side. His cousin\u2019s thoughts\nwere set on Winterfell and it was easy to contain the dragon\u2019s thoughts by\nchanneling the image of the dark and humid earth around the weirwood tree. But\nBran knew he had many tasks ahead and the steady hammering of his heart that\nbeat through the images was fast. In some of his tasks he probably would fail.\nStill he had to try. </p><p>Jon settled\non the dragon, and the others were climbing on. He and Jon had worked well\ntogether, one task was done. As if in a distinct murmur Bran heard Jaime\nLannister joking about Aegon the Reluctant and his banner, just when he left\nRhaegal\u2019s mind.</p><p>In a short\nflick he concentrated on Nymeria. His sister\u2019s big direwolf was easy as well.\nAlthough Arya had made a face everytime Bran had told her to reach her wolf\nBran could feel that their connection was stronger and was still growing\nstronger. He only had to nudge a little. The wolf was already bound for\nWinterfell in a fast pace. It was good that she had been North of the Neck\nalready, when Bran had reached out to her weeks ago. The wolf had already\nsensed Arya and followed her. Nymeria would be here soon. </p><p>He sent his\nmind further North, carefully and stealthily so that his enemy would not sense\nhim. He was a thin tendril of smoke, a feather on the wind, high in the air.\nBran could feel the Wall, but it felt different. Not like the strong structure\nit had been, not like the taut bowstring it had been when he had passed the\nWall. The tension was gone, the Wall was breached, Bran could see the army of\nthe dead flooding through the wall, their strides slow but with a dogged intent\nset on the path to Winterfell. The wights\u2019 masters were driving them onwards relentlessly.</p><p>Bran\nretreated and chided himself for checking what he had known would happen. Bran\nknew that he was postponing the inevitable. The other dragon. He was south of\nthe neck, he had a strong connection to his mother, and the indifference of a\nhuge predator to smaller beings. But Bran had to try, for several reasons.</p><p>He rooted\nhimself deeply into the weirwood and reached out, stretching himself thin,\nentering the pit of fire that was Drogon\u2019s mind. A red and gold furnace that\nwas beautiful and dangerous, so dangerous. He stayed in the background and\nlistened.</p><p><i>\u201cI will have my revenge on Cersei. She tried to\ncontrol my dragons, I\u2019ll see her pay for that.\u201d </i>Daenerys insisted. Her words were muffled in\nthe dragon\u2019s mind. Tyrion Lannister was standing at her side, his figure small\nbefore the huge dragon. He looked very unhappy. Daenerys reached up and petted\nthe dragon. Bran would not have understood the words, if he had not seen this\nscene several times already, always looking for the loophole, the breach in the\nwall, the opportunity to give a nudge to the scales to that they would swing\nanother way.</p><p><i>\u201cYour Grace, you saw that the dragons are not\ninvincible. It is a great risk you want to take.\u201d</i></p><p>Through the\ndragon\u2019s mind Bran could feel the barely contained anger of the dragon\u2019s\nmother. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll fly to the Red Keep on Drogon and set\nfire to it. We haven\u2019t been using the dragons to our best advantage. We burnt\nsome carts, harassed our enemies. It is not enough. I will have her yield.\u201d </i></p><p>Daenerys\ndid not shout, but her cheeks were red from excitement, and her chest was\nheaving. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd when I have returned, and Cersei is dead,\nwe will see about this King in the North. He\u2019ll bend the knee then! I\u2019m done\nwith waiting.\u201d</i></p><p>Drogon\u2019s\nmind wandered to his brother then, Rhaegal, Bran could feel it. Unlike the\nqueen, the dragon knew that Rhaegal had a connection to another human than his\nmother. It was a vague unsettling feeling in the dragon\u2019s mind and quickly Bran\nthought of the wind under Rhaegal\u2019s wings, the feeling of freedom. He wove this\ninto Drogon\u2019s mind in thin gossamer threads not stronger than a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>Drogon\nstopped scratching the earth with his claw in his unrest about his brother,\nreassured by the images of flying. Bran distracted him from the earthy smell of\nthe weirwood. Bran did not allow himself to sigh in relief that Drogon would\nnot go looking for Rhaegal. When he concentrated on the humans again, the\ndiscussion had gone on.</p><p><i>\u201cYour grace, please, this is too dangerous.\nThere are still caches of wildfire under the ground in King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</i></p><p>Daenerys\nsnorted, her face a grimace<i>. \u201cI\u2019ll just\nignite the Red Keep and execute Cersei.\u201d</i></p><p>Tyrion\u2019s\nvoice was high-pitched in agitation<i> \u201cYour\ngrace, many people might die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen they should not have sided with the wrong\nqueen. It is time to take what is mine</i>.\u201d She turned from her Hand and beckoned the\ndragon to her. </p><p><i>\u201cYou make me almost think that you want to\nprotect the sister that wanted you dead.\u201d</i></p><p>Bran\ninhaled the rich sent of the black humid earth at the weirwood tree and\nprepared for fighting. Where is the breach, there must be a breach! He dug his\nheels in.</p><p>When\nDaenerys had mounted her dragon, he would not take wings. Bran flooded his\nbrain with images of the earth of Winterfell. </p><p>But what\nhad worked with Rhaegal would not work with Drogon. Bran had no connection to\nthe rider and even if he had, the fire of her thoughts fed Drogon\u2019s mind until\nthe flames of her anger flared his. The dragon\u2019s mind became a roaring furnace\nthat was burning in white hot flames and Bran had to leave. There were still fights\nahead. He had to spare some of his strength.</p><p>He had\nknown it all along, and yet he felt tears on his cheeks, when he felt someone\nshake him. He opened his eyes and drank thirstily when Podrick offered him\nwater. His throat felt parched. He would have closed his eyes again, but\nPodrick insisted that he ate as well.</p><p>He let Winterfell\nfall back again and sent his mind south again. The person he wanted to reach\nnow was easier. Theon was no stranger to the weirwood after all. But Theon\u2019s\nmind had other pitfalls. </p><p>At least he\nhad not wasted too much time in his effort to hold Daenerys back. He slipped\ninto Theon\u2019s mind when he just pulled a hood over his head. He held the hand of\nhis sister Yara who did not look like she was in good shape. Theon turned and\nhelped his sister to pull her hood up as well. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nhurry.\u201d</p><p>Yara\ngritted her teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll manage\u201d.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon\u201d,</i> Bran whispered. Theon shook his head as if a\nfly had buzzed by. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again. Theon tapped his ear, a puzzled look on his face. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran tried to shout. He\nglimpsed Podrick who was staring at him open-mouthed. He must have shouted in\nWinterfell.</p><p>Theon still\nhad not reacted other than mistrusting the sounds he heard. </p><p>\u201cHurry, we\nmust hurry.\u201d He urged Yara forward.</p><p>Bran sent a\nshort flash of an image into Theon\u2019s mind. He had thought long and hard on what\nthis image could be, something that would not remind Theon of the times he was\ntortured and would yet remind him of Winterfell. </p><p><i>It was summer, a hot day. Theon held a bow in\nhis hand and was taking aim. Robb urged him on, shouting on the top of his\nlung, telling him where to aim next. Both were laughing.</i></p><p>Theon\nstopped in his tracks. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again.<i> </i></p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d Yara wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2026.\nWinterfell\u2026\u201d. Theon\u2019s voice was as flimsy as the rustling of leaves.</p><p>Yara\nfrowned.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon, listen and watch!\u201d</i> He lured him in, he sent him the\nsense of Winterfell, the leaves rustling in the weirwood leaves, the sun\nglistening in the pool below the Weirwood, the smell of the earth. In another\nworld, or maybe in some other time, Theon came closer, his eyes wary, suddenly\nrealising that Bran was there.</p><p>\u201cBran, you\nare alive!\u201d</p><p>Bran looked\nat himself and Theon from above. Fog was dancing around their feet. Theon had\nreached Bran. Just in the moment he recoiled when he saw that Bran\u2019s eyes were\nall white, Bran snatched at his hand. \u201cLearn! Watch!

He already associated the earthy smell of the\nWeirwood that Bran sent into his mind with his rider. He lowered himself on the\nground, making himself as small as a dragon could get, and set his golden eyes\nto look at Jon, an oversized dog apparently waiting on his master.</p><p>The army\nwas abuzz, and Bran could see that several officers came closer, their stance a\nmixture of wariness, awe and curiosity.</p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his hand, the golden one and pointed at Jon.</p><p>\u201cBehold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men!\u201d he\nshouted.</p><p>Jon stood\nstraight, his face a mask, serious, guarded and yet not aloof. Even Bran could\nnot have said, what his thoughts were. </p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his voice again.</p><p>\u201cPrince\nRhaegar\u2019s son has come in the hour of our need.

You know, what you have to do, Arya.\u201d</p><p>Arya bit\nher lip. \u201cNymeria is on her way, but she\u2019s still far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her\nhurry!\u201d </p><p>Sansa gave\ninstruction to the dozen knights that she had dispatched to guard her brother.\nShe had ordered them to take a bag of food each and now she placed one at\nBran\u2019s feet. With her face so close, Bran could see that her eyes were\nred-rimmed from crying, but listening to her giving orders to the knights,\ninstructing Podrick to give Bran water every three hours at the very least and\na bite to eat as well, Bran would never have thought that she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou go to\nthe castle,\u201d he encouraged her. \u201cThey will need the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>He made an\neffort to remember what would be expected of him. He took her hand, pressed it,\nand moved the muscles that made him smile. </p><p>\u201cWe have a\nchance. I know you will manage well. Send more people to guard me, once the\nWalkers come.\u201d</p><p>He rested\nhis hand on the direwolf\u2019s head again. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nknow when we need the wolves,\u201d he told Arya.</p><p>Bran knew\nthat he would look as if life had left him but sitting at the weirwood and\ndiving into the wisdom that awaited him was the only time he felt alive now. He\nknew that he was living other people\u2019s lives, that he felt other people\u2019s love\nand yet all that at the same time made him dizzy and hungry for more at the\nsame time. Knowledge and wisdom were his. It was a blessing and a burden. He\ncould try to act at the right time from what he knew, and yet he never had the\nfeeling he knew enough. His thirst could not be quenched and yet he had to\nwatch himself so that he would not drown. Meera eyed him, a worried look on her\nface. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve\ntalked about this. I\u2019ll manage,\u201d he told her. </p><p>The worry\ndid not leave her face, but he pushed that away and delved into the swirling\nimages that came when he touched the weirwood.</p><p>It was not\nthat difficult to get hold of Jon with Ghost by his side. His cousin\u2019s thoughts\nwere set on Winterfell and it was easy to contain the dragon\u2019s thoughts by\nchanneling the image of the dark and humid earth around the weirwood tree. But\nBran knew he had many tasks ahead and the steady hammering of his heart that\nbeat through the images was fast. In some of his tasks he probably would fail.\nStill he had to try. </p><p>Jon settled\non the dragon, and the others were climbing on. He and Jon had worked well\ntogether, one task was done. As if in a distinct murmur Bran heard Jaime\nLannister joking about Aegon the Reluctant and his banner, just when he left\nRhaegal\u2019s mind.</p><p>In a short\nflick he concentrated on Nymeria. His sister\u2019s big direwolf was easy as well.\nAlthough Arya had made a face everytime Bran had told her to reach her wolf\nBran could feel that their connection was stronger and was still growing\nstronger. He only had to nudge a little. The wolf was already bound for\nWinterfell in a fast pace. It was good that she had been North of the Neck\nalready, when Bran had reached out to her weeks ago. The wolf had already\nsensed Arya and followed her. Nymeria would be here soon. </p><p>He sent his\nmind further North, carefully and stealthily so that his enemy would not sense\nhim. He was a thin tendril of smoke, a feather on the wind, high in the air.\nBran could feel the Wall, but it felt different. Not like the strong structure\nit had been, not like the taut bowstring it had been when he had passed the\nWall. The tension was gone, the Wall was breached, Bran could see the army of\nthe dead flooding through the wall, their strides slow but with a dogged intent\nset on the path to Winterfell. The wights\u2019 masters were driving them onwards relentlessly.</p><p>Bran\nretreated and chided himself for checking what he had known would happen. Bran\nknew that he was postponing the inevitable. The other dragon. He was south of\nthe neck, he had a strong connection to his mother, and the indifference of a\nhuge predator to smaller beings. But Bran had to try, for several reasons.</p><p>He rooted\nhimself deeply into the weirwood and reached out, stretching himself thin,\nentering the pit of fire that was Drogon\u2019s mind. A red and gold furnace that\nwas beautiful and dangerous, so dangerous. He stayed in the background and\nlistened.</p><p><i>\u201cI will have my revenge on Cersei. She tried to\ncontrol my dragons, I\u2019ll see her pay for that.\u201d </i>Daenerys insisted. Her words were muffled in\nthe dragon\u2019s mind. Tyrion Lannister was standing at her side, his figure small\nbefore the huge dragon. He looked very unhappy. Daenerys reached up and petted\nthe dragon. Bran would not have understood the words, if he had not seen this\nscene several times already, always looking for the loophole, the breach in the\nwall, the opportunity to give a nudge to the scales to that they would swing\nanother way.</p><p><i>\u201cYour Grace, you saw that the dragons are not\ninvincible. It is a great risk you want to take.\u201d</i></p><p>Through the\ndragon\u2019s mind Bran could feel the barely contained anger of the dragon\u2019s\nmother. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll fly to the Red Keep on Drogon and set\nfire to it. We haven\u2019t been using the dragons to our best advantage. We burnt\nsome carts, harassed our enemies. It is not enough. I will have her yield.\u201d </i></p><p>Daenerys\ndid not shout, but her cheeks were red from excitement, and her chest was\nheaving. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd when I have returned, and Cersei is dead,\nwe will see about this King in the North. He\u2019ll bend the knee then! I\u2019m done\nwith waiting.\u201d</i></p><p>Drogon\u2019s\nmind wandered to his brother then, Rhaegal, Bran could feel it. Unlike the\nqueen, the dragon knew that Rhaegal had a connection to another human than his\nmother. It was a vague unsettling feeling in the dragon\u2019s mind and quickly Bran\nthought of the wind under Rhaegal\u2019s wings, the feeling of freedom. He wove this\ninto Drogon\u2019s mind in thin gossamer threads not stronger than a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>Drogon\nstopped scratching the earth with his claw in his unrest about his brother,\nreassured by the images of flying. Bran distracted him from the earthy smell of\nthe weirwood. Bran did not allow himself to sigh in relief that Drogon would\nnot go looking for Rhaegal. When he concentrated on the humans again, the\ndiscussion had gone on.</p><p><i>\u201cYour grace, please, this is too dangerous.\nThere are still caches of wildfire under the ground in King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</i></p><p>Daenerys\nsnorted, her face a grimace<i>. \u201cI\u2019ll just\nignite the Red Keep and execute Cersei.\u201d</i></p><p>Tyrion\u2019s\nvoice was high-pitched in agitation<i> \u201cYour\ngrace, many people might die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen they should not have sided with the wrong\nqueen. It is time to take what is mine</i>.\u201d She turned from her Hand and beckoned the\ndragon to her. </p><p><i>\u201cYou make me almost think that you want to\nprotect the sister that wanted you dead.\u201d</i></p><p>Bran\ninhaled the rich sent of the black humid earth at the weirwood tree and\nprepared for fighting. Where is the breach, there must be a breach! He dug his\nheels in.</p><p>When\nDaenerys had mounted her dragon, he would not take wings. Bran flooded his\nbrain with images of the earth of Winterfell. </p><p>But what\nhad worked with Rhaegal would not work with Drogon. Bran had no connection to\nthe rider and even if he had, the fire of her thoughts fed Drogon\u2019s mind until\nthe flames of her anger flared his. The dragon\u2019s mind became a roaring furnace\nthat was burning in white hot flames and Bran had to leave. There were still fights\nahead. He had to spare some of his strength.</p><p>He had\nknown it all along, and yet he felt tears on his cheeks, when he felt someone\nshake him. He opened his eyes and drank thirstily when Podrick offered him\nwater. His throat felt parched. He would have closed his eyes again, but\nPodrick insisted that he ate as well.</p><p>He let Winterfell\nfall back again and sent his mind south again. The person he wanted to reach\nnow was easier. Theon was no stranger to the weirwood after all. But Theon\u2019s\nmind had other pitfalls. </p><p>At least he\nhad not wasted too much time in his effort to hold Daenerys back. He slipped\ninto Theon\u2019s mind when he just pulled a hood over his head. He held the hand of\nhis sister Yara who did not look like she was in good shape. Theon turned and\nhelped his sister to pull her hood up as well. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nhurry.\u201d</p><p>Yara\ngritted her teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll manage\u201d.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon\u201d,</i> Bran whispered. Theon shook his head as if a\nfly had buzzed by. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again. Theon tapped his ear, a puzzled look on his face. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran tried to shout. He\nglimpsed Podrick who was staring at him open-mouthed. He must have shouted in\nWinterfell.</p><p>Theon still\nhad not reacted other than mistrusting the sounds he heard. </p><p>\u201cHurry, we\nmust hurry.\u201d He urged Yara forward.</p><p>Bran sent a\nshort flash of an image into Theon\u2019s mind. He had thought long and hard on what\nthis image could be, something that would not remind Theon of the times he was\ntortured and would yet remind him of Winterfell. </p><p><i>It was summer, a hot day. Theon held a bow in\nhis hand and was taking aim. Robb urged him on, shouting on the top of his\nlung, telling him where to aim next. Both were laughing.</i></p><p>Theon\nstopped in his tracks. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again.<i> </i></p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d Yara wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2026.\nWinterfell\u2026\u201d. Theon\u2019s voice was as flimsy as the rustling of leaves.</p><p>Yara\nfrowned.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon, listen and watch!\u201d</i> He lured him in, he sent him the\nsense of Winterfell, the leaves rustling in the weirwood leaves, the sun\nglistening in the pool below the Weirwood, the smell of the earth. In another\nworld, or maybe in some other time, Theon came closer, his eyes wary, suddenly\nrealising that Bran was there.</p><p>\u201cBran, you\nare alive!\u201d</p><p>Bran looked\nat himself and Theon from above. Fog was dancing around their feet. Theon had\nreached Bran. Just in the moment he recoiled when he saw that Bran\u2019s eyes were\nall white, Bran snatched at his hand. \u201cLearn! Watch! This is the future!\u201d</p><p>Bran sent\nhim images in a quick order. Theon and Yara, running through the streets of King\u2019s\nLanding, shouting warnings, the shadow of a dragon over the Red Keep, Balerion\nthe black dread come again, dragonfire in the keep, growing fast, the wind\npicking up the flames, the green snakes of wildfire. </p><p>Three\ntimes, he sent him the pictures, then he let go of his hand and his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\nTheon, you are the only one who can help the people in King\u2019s Landing. You are\nthe only one I can reach.\u201d</p><p>Bran could\nnot say if Theon had heard it, because Pod was shaking him again. There was a\nchance that he would understand, a chance, but Bran would not know before Theon\ncame North again. </p><p>Meera\ninsisted that he drank more. Bran felt his cheeks and was surprised to find\ntears. </p><p>\u201cDid you\nsucceed?\u201d Meera asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\nno, partly, maybe.\u201d He shrugged. They had discussed his course of action on\ntheir way to Winterfell, again and again.</p><p>\u201cYou\nalready look exhausted,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must make time for a small break.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLater\u201d.</p><p>He delved\ninto the weirwood again.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Rhaegal was\nwell under control, when Bran slipped into his mind again, but the dragon would\nhave to eat soon.

He lowered himself on the\nground, making himself as small as a dragon could get, and set his golden eyes\nto look at Jon, an oversized dog apparently waiting on his master.</p><p>The army\nwas abuzz, and Bran could see that several officers came closer, their stance a\nmixture of wariness, awe and curiosity.</p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his hand, the golden one and pointed at Jon.</p><p>\u201cBehold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men!\u201d he\nshouted.</p><p>Jon stood\nstraight, his face a mask, serious, guarded and yet not aloof. Even Bran could\nnot have said, what his thoughts were. </p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his voice again.</p><p>\u201cPrince\nRhaegar\u2019s son has come in the hour of our need. He has laid aside all the wars\nof the houses, so that we can face the threat that comes upon us unexpectedly\nfrom the North. We\u2019ll stand together against the enemy that would destroy us\nall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Jaime\nof House Lannister, pledge my oath to King Aegon. I have promised to fight when\nhe protects the seven kingdoms.\u201d He sank on his knees and drew his sword with a\nflourish. Bran could almost hear the collective gasp. </p><p><i>\u201cJon, tell them, and then I can show everybody\nhow things are in the North.\u201d</i></p><p>Jon waited\na moment before he accepted Jaime\u2019s sword. <i></i></p><p>He raised\nit above his head. </p><p>\u201cI pledge\nmy oath to the peace and the prosperity of all the seven kingdoms. We lay aside\nthe petty squabbles of the Game of Thrones.\u201d</p><p>He pointed\nat Olyvar. \u201cOlyvar of House Frey and Jaime of House Lannister have seen the\nthreat that awaits us all. We need to stand together! The White Walkers have\ncome again, but I know the living will fight. I know you will fight!\u201d</p><p>He gestured\nto the dragon and Bran acted. He slipped deep into Rhaegal\u2019s mind and the\ndragon rose. He pointed his head to the air and a roaring flame ascended. The\nsnow flakes melted in the heat and produced a myriad of glittering drops. Bran\npushed with all the strength he had. </p><p><i>The wall of ice rose a thousand feet and more.\nIt looked strong and unsurmountable. But like a taut bow that snapped, a\nsection on top of the wall blew outward and it crumbled fast. When the ice dust\nhad settled, the breach in the wall was clearly visible, and the Undead came\nthrough, their rotting corpses a terrible sight. The White Walkers followed\ntheir piercing blue eyes focussing, so that it seemed as if they were looking\nat the army.</i></p><p>Bran could\nhear the cries of the soldiers, just before he fell unconscious.</p>",

Bran is setting up the pieces to prepare for the attack of the WW\u2026 Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8470255/chapters/38525381\">AO3</a>. <br></p><p>Bran\u2019s left\nhand touched Ghost, his right hand the weirwood. He nodded at his sisters. \u201cLet\nmy guards wake me occasionally to give me water and something to eat, but not\ntoo often. Our enemies are close, and I have work to do to fight them. My\nguards must protect me, when our enemies come. If they get me here, we are\nlost.\u201d</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him unhappily. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you do that whatever it is you do in the\ncastle?\u201d</p><p>Bran just\nshook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay\nwith you,\u201d Arya said.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Bran shook\nhis head again. \u201cMeera stays with me. You know, what you have to do, Arya.\u201d</p><p>Arya bit\nher lip. \u201cNymeria is on her way, but she\u2019s still far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her\nhurry!\u201d </p><p>Sansa gave\ninstruction to the dozen knights that she had dispatched to guard her brother.\nShe had ordered them to take a bag of food each and now she placed one at\nBran\u2019s feet. With her face so close, Bran could see that her eyes were\nred-rimmed from crying, but listening to her giving orders to the knights,\ninstructing Podrick to give Bran water every three hours at the very least and\na bite to eat as well, Bran would never have thought that she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou go to\nthe castle,\u201d he encouraged her. \u201cThey will need the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d</p><p>He made an\neffort to remember what would be expected of him. He took her hand, pressed it,\nand moved the muscles that made him smile. </p><p>\u201cWe have a\nchance. I know you will manage well. Send more people to guard me, once the\nWalkers come.\u201d</p><p>He rested\nhis hand on the direwolf\u2019s head again. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\nknow when we need the wolves,\u201d he told Arya.</p><p>Bran knew\nthat he would look as if life had left him but sitting at the weirwood and\ndiving into the wisdom that awaited him was the only time he felt alive now. He\nknew that he was living other people\u2019s lives, that he felt other people\u2019s love\nand yet all that at the same time made him dizzy and hungry for more at the\nsame time. Knowledge and wisdom were his. It was a blessing and a burden. He\ncould try to act at the right time from what he knew, and yet he never had the\nfeeling he knew enough. His thirst could not be quenched and yet he had to\nwatch himself so that he would not drown. Meera eyed him, a worried look on her\nface. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve\ntalked about this. I\u2019ll manage,\u201d he told her. </p><p>The worry\ndid not leave her face, but he pushed that away and delved into the swirling\nimages that came when he touched the weirwood.</p><p>It was not\nthat difficult to get hold of Jon with Ghost by his side. His cousin\u2019s thoughts\nwere set on Winterfell and it was easy to contain the dragon\u2019s thoughts by\nchanneling the image of the dark and humid earth around the weirwood tree. But\nBran knew he had many tasks ahead and the steady hammering of his heart that\nbeat through the images was fast. In some of his tasks he probably would fail.\nStill he had to try. </p><p>Jon settled\non the dragon, and the others were climbing on. He and Jon had worked well\ntogether, one task was done. As if in a distinct murmur Bran heard Jaime\nLannister joking about Aegon the Reluctant and his banner, just when he left\nRhaegal\u2019s mind.</p><p>In a short\nflick he concentrated on Nymeria. His sister\u2019s big direwolf was easy as well.\nAlthough Arya had made a face everytime Bran had told her to reach her wolf\nBran could feel that their connection was stronger and was still growing\nstronger. He only had to nudge a little. The wolf was already bound for\nWinterfell in a fast pace. It was good that she had been North of the Neck\nalready, when Bran had reached out to her weeks ago. The wolf had already\nsensed Arya and followed her. Nymeria would be here soon. </p><p>He sent his\nmind further North, carefully and stealthily so that his enemy would not sense\nhim. He was a thin tendril of smoke, a feather on the wind, high in the air.\nBran could feel the Wall, but it felt different. Not like the strong structure\nit had been, not like the taut bowstring it had been when he had passed the\nWall. The tension was gone, the Wall was breached, Bran could see the army of\nthe dead flooding through the wall, their strides slow but with a dogged intent\nset on the path to Winterfell. The wights\u2019 masters were driving them onwards relentlessly.</p><p>Bran\nretreated and chided himself for checking what he had known would happen. Bran\nknew that he was postponing the inevitable. The other dragon. He was south of\nthe neck, he had a strong connection to his mother, and the indifference of a\nhuge predator to smaller beings. But Bran had to try, for several reasons.</p><p>He rooted\nhimself deeply into the weirwood and reached out, stretching himself thin,\nentering the pit of fire that was Drogon\u2019s mind. A red and gold furnace that\nwas beautiful and dangerous, so dangerous. He stayed in the background and\nlistened.</p><p><i>\u201cI will have my revenge on Cersei. She tried to\ncontrol my dragons, I\u2019ll see her pay for that.\u201d </i>Daenerys insisted. Her words were muffled in\nthe dragon\u2019s mind. Tyrion Lannister was standing at her side, his figure small\nbefore the huge dragon. He looked very unhappy. Daenerys reached up and petted\nthe dragon. Bran would not have understood the words, if he had not seen this\nscene several times already, always looking for the loophole, the breach in the\nwall, the opportunity to give a nudge to the scales to that they would swing\nanother way.</p><p><i>\u201cYour Grace, you saw that the dragons are not\ninvincible. It is a great risk you want to take.\u201d</i></p><p>Through the\ndragon\u2019s mind Bran could feel the barely contained anger of the dragon\u2019s\nmother. </p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019ll fly to the Red Keep on Drogon and set\nfire to it. We haven\u2019t been using the dragons to our best advantage. We burnt\nsome carts, harassed our enemies. It is not enough. I will have her yield.\u201d </i></p><p>Daenerys\ndid not shout, but her cheeks were red from excitement, and her chest was\nheaving. </p><p><i>\u201cAnd when I have returned, and Cersei is dead,\nwe will see about this King in the North. He\u2019ll bend the knee then! I\u2019m done\nwith waiting.\u201d</i></p><p>Drogon\u2019s\nmind wandered to his brother then, Rhaegal, Bran could feel it. Unlike the\nqueen, the dragon knew that Rhaegal had a connection to another human than his\nmother. It was a vague unsettling feeling in the dragon\u2019s mind and quickly Bran\nthought of the wind under Rhaegal\u2019s wings, the feeling of freedom. He wove this\ninto Drogon\u2019s mind in thin gossamer threads not stronger than a spider\u2019s web. </p><p>Drogon\nstopped scratching the earth with his claw in his unrest about his brother,\nreassured by the images of flying. Bran distracted him from the earthy smell of\nthe weirwood. Bran did not allow himself to sigh in relief that Drogon would\nnot go looking for Rhaegal. When he concentrated on the humans again, the\ndiscussion had gone on.</p><p><i>\u201cYour grace, please, this is too dangerous.\nThere are still caches of wildfire under the ground in King\u2019s Landing.\u201d</i></p><p>Daenerys\nsnorted, her face a grimace<i>. \u201cI\u2019ll just\nignite the Red Keep and execute Cersei.\u201d</i></p><p>Tyrion\u2019s\nvoice was high-pitched in agitation<i> \u201cYour\ngrace, many people might die.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cThen they should not have sided with the wrong\nqueen. It is time to take what is mine</i>.\u201d She turned from her Hand and beckoned the\ndragon to her. </p><p><i>\u201cYou make me almost think that you want to\nprotect the sister that wanted you dead.\u201d</i></p><p>Bran\ninhaled the rich sent of the black humid earth at the weirwood tree and\nprepared for fighting. Where is the breach, there must be a breach! He dug his\nheels in.</p><p>When\nDaenerys had mounted her dragon, he would not take wings. Bran flooded his\nbrain with images of the earth of Winterfell. </p><p>But what\nhad worked with Rhaegal would not work with Drogon. Bran had no connection to\nthe rider and even if he had, the fire of her thoughts fed Drogon\u2019s mind until\nthe flames of her anger flared his. The dragon\u2019s mind became a roaring furnace\nthat was burning in white hot flames and Bran had to leave. There were still fights\nahead. He had to spare some of his strength.</p><p>He had\nknown it all along, and yet he felt tears on his cheeks, when he felt someone\nshake him. He opened his eyes and drank thirstily when Podrick offered him\nwater. His throat felt parched. He would have closed his eyes again, but\nPodrick insisted that he ate as well.</p><p>He let Winterfell\nfall back again and sent his mind south again. The person he wanted to reach\nnow was easier. Theon was no stranger to the weirwood after all. But Theon\u2019s\nmind had other pitfalls. </p><p>At least he\nhad not wasted too much time in his effort to hold Daenerys back. He slipped\ninto Theon\u2019s mind when he just pulled a hood over his head. He held the hand of\nhis sister Yara who did not look like she was in good shape. Theon turned and\nhelped his sister to pull her hood up as well. </p><p>\u201cWe have to\nhurry.\u201d</p><p>Yara\ngritted her teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll manage\u201d.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon\u201d,</i> Bran whispered. Theon shook his head as if a\nfly had buzzed by. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again. Theon tapped his ear, a puzzled look on his face. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran tried to shout. He\nglimpsed Podrick who was staring at him open-mouthed. He must have shouted in\nWinterfell.</p><p>Theon still\nhad not reacted other than mistrusting the sounds he heard. </p><p>\u201cHurry, we\nmust hurry.\u201d He urged Yara forward.</p><p>Bran sent a\nshort flash of an image into Theon\u2019s mind. He had thought long and hard on what\nthis image could be, something that would not remind Theon of the times he was\ntortured and would yet remind him of Winterfell. </p><p><i>It was summer, a hot day. Theon held a bow in\nhis hand and was taking aim. Robb urged him on, shouting on the top of his\nlung, telling him where to aim next. Both were laughing.</i></p><p>Theon\nstopped in his tracks. <i>\u201cTheon\u201d, </i>Bran\nwhispered again.<i> </i></p><p>\u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d Yara wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cRobb\u2026.\nWinterfell\u2026\u201d. Theon\u2019s voice was as flimsy as the rustling of leaves.</p><p>Yara\nfrowned.</p><p><i>\u201cTheon, listen and watch!\u201d</i> He lured him in, he sent him the\nsense of Winterfell, the leaves rustling in the weirwood leaves, the sun\nglistening in the pool below the Weirwood, the smell of the earth. In another\nworld, or maybe in some other time, Theon came closer, his eyes wary, suddenly\nrealising that Bran was there.</p><p>\u201cBran, you\nare alive!\u201d</p><p>Bran looked\nat himself and Theon from above. Fog was dancing around their feet. Theon had\nreached Bran. Just in the moment he recoiled when he saw that Bran\u2019s eyes were\nall white, Bran snatched at his hand. \u201cLearn! Watch! This is the future!\u201d</p><p>Bran sent\nhim images in a quick order. Theon and Yara, running through the streets of King\u2019s\nLanding, shouting warnings, the shadow of a dragon over the Red Keep, Balerion\nthe black dread come again, dragonfire in the keep, growing fast, the wind\npicking up the flames, the green snakes of wildfire. </p><p>Three\ntimes, he sent him the pictures, then he let go of his hand and his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\nTheon, you are the only one who can help the people in King\u2019s Landing. You are\nthe only one I can reach.\u201d</p><p>Bran could\nnot say if Theon had heard it, because Pod was shaking him again. There was a\nchance that he would understand, a chance, but Bran would not know before Theon\ncame North again. </p><p>Meera\ninsisted that he drank more. Bran felt his cheeks and was surprised to find\ntears. </p><p>\u201cDid you\nsucceed?\u201d Meera asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\nno, partly, maybe.\u201d He shrugged. They had discussed his course of action on\ntheir way to Winterfell, again and again.</p><p>\u201cYou\nalready look exhausted,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must make time for a small break.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLater\u201d.</p><p>He delved\ninto the weirwood again.</p><p>\u2014-</p><p>Rhaegal was\nwell under control, when Bran slipped into his mind again, but the dragon would\nhave to eat soon. They were flying in a light snowfall and the dragon would\nneed energy. Jon had made considerable progress and they were approaching\nRiverrun and the Lannister armies. </p><p>\u201cA white\nwolf on a red field with a green lizard in his mouth.\u201d </p><p>Jaime\nLannister was still joking about the banner, or he was at it again. Bran\ncouldn\u2019t tell. Judging from the way Jon pursed his lips, it was not the first\nridiculous idea the Kingslayer voiced. </p><p> \u201cI take a white wolf on an ice-white field\nchequered with a green dragon on a field of grass.\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was flat.</p><p>\u201cIs that\nyour final decision, your grace?\u201d</p><p>Jon turned\naround and shot Jaime a nasty look.</p><p>\u201cIf you\nmake one more suggestion about my banner I will throw you from this dragon,\nunderstood? Being in pain from being injured only gets you some leverage. You\ntold us yourself, that it doesn\u2019t really matter. I want you to concentrate on\nhow you will address the armies instead.\u201d</p><p>Jaime\nLannister did not answer immediately, and when he finally talked again his\nvoice had lost some of his flippant tone.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t\nthought much about it. We fly some rounds over the camp. You drop me off. I\ntell them, we have a king and that we march for the rescue of Winterfell. I\nguess the dragon will be very persuasive.\u201d</p><p>Jon\ngrowled.</p><p>\u201cThink\nagain. We want this people fighting in a desperate war. We want to persuade\nthem to fight against an enemy they do not know. If I pressure them by threatening\nthem with a dragon, they will just bolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all\ngood and noble. But they probably won\u2019t just overlook that there is a dragon.\nAnd even if no one saw a living dragon, they know what a dragon can do. And it\nis not as if I can hide I was burnt, even if it was not your dragon.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cJon, I\u2019ll show them. I can show them, at least\nfor a little while. You just have to make them stand and listen\u201d.</i></p><p>Jon shook\nhimself as if he was not sure what he had heard. <i>Bran, is that you?</i></p><p><i>\u201cTrust me, Jon.\u201d </i></p><p>Bran could\nfeel his cousin hesitating, as is he did not trust his senses, but then he\nnodded.</p><p>\u201cYour\ngrace,\u201d Brienne interjected.</p><p>\u201cAt the\nparley in Saltpans you showed Olyvar Frey as proof, that you left the war\nbetween the houses aside for the good of the realm. I think it would be a good\nidea, if you did something similar at Riverrun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you\nmind leading an army, Brienne?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d.\nBrienne was flustered. </p><p>\u201cYou and\nSer Jaime. I need someone loyal to House Stark.\u201d</p><p>Brienne was\nprotesting, but Jon was intent on guiding the dragon. They had approached the\narmy now and Jon let the dragon fly several times above the heads of the\nsoldiers. </p><p>\u201cOlyvar,\nmaybe you could do some announcements. Wave that cloth as if you knew what is\non it.\u201c</p><p>When they\nhad landed, Olyvar was the first to descend. </p><p>\u201cBehold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men.!\u201d</p><p>Bran\nconcentrated on the dragon. When Jaime and Brienne descended their smell\nreached the dragon\u2019s noistrils and Bran was quick to deflect the dragon to Jon.\nRhaegal had been quick to adjust. He already associated the earthy smell of the\nWeirwood that Bran sent into his mind with his rider. He lowered himself on the\nground, making himself as small as a dragon could get, and set his golden eyes\nto look at Jon, an oversized dog apparently waiting on his master.</p><p>The army\nwas abuzz, and Bran could see that several officers came closer, their stance a\nmixture of wariness, awe and curiosity.</p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his hand, the golden one and pointed at Jon.</p><p>\u201cBehold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men!\u201d he\nshouted.</p><p>Jon stood\nstraight, his face a mask, serious, guarded and yet not aloof. Even Bran could\nnot have said, what his thoughts were. </p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his voice again.</p><p>\u201cPrince\nRhaegar\u2019s son has come in the hour of our need. He has laid aside all the wars\nof the houses, so that we can face the threat that comes upon us unexpectedly\nfrom the North. We\u2019ll stand together against the enemy that would destroy us\nall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, Jaime\nof House Lannister, pledge my oath to King Aegon. I have promised to fight when\nhe protects the seven kingdoms.\u201d He sank on his knees and drew his sword with a\nflourish. Bran could almost hear the collective gasp. </p><p><i>\u201cJon, tell them, and then I can show everybody\nhow things are in the North.\u201d</i></p><p>Jon waited\na moment before he accepted Jaime\u2019s sword. <i></i></p><p>He raised\nit above his head. </p><p>\u201cI pledge\nmy oath to the peace and the prosperity of all the seven kingdoms. We lay aside\nthe petty squabbles of the Game of Thrones.\u201d</p><p>He pointed\nat Olyvar. \u201cOlyvar of House Frey and Jaime of House Lannister have seen the\nthreat that awaits us all. We need to stand together! The White Walkers have\ncome again, but I know the living will fight. I know you will fight!\u201d</p><p>He gestured\nto the dragon and Bran acted. He slipped deep into Rhaegal\u2019s mind and the\ndragon rose. He pointed his head to the air and a roaring flame ascended.

He nodded at his sisters. &ldquo;Let\nmy guards wake me occasionally to give me water and something to eat, but not\ntoo often. Our enemies are close, and I have work to do to fight them. My\nguards must protect me, when our enemies come. If they get me here, we are\nlost.&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa\nlooked at him unhappily. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you do that whatever it is you do in the\ncastle?&rdquo;</p><p>Bran just\nshook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay\nwith you,&rdquo; Arya said.</p><p>Bran shook\nhis head again. &ldquo;Meera stays with me. You know, what you have to do, Arya.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya bit\nher lip. &ldquo;Nymeria is on her way, but she&rsquo;s still far.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Make her\nhurry!&rdquo; </p><p>Sansa gave\ninstruction to the dozen knights that she had dispatched to guard her brother.\nShe had ordered them to take a bag of food each and now she placed one at\nBran&rsquo;s feet. With her face so close, Bran could see that her eyes were\nred-rimmed from crying, but listening to her giving orders to the knights,\ninstructing Podrick to give Bran water every three hours at the very least and\na bite to eat as well, Bran would never have thought that she was afraid.</p><p>&ldquo;You go to\nthe castle,&rdquo; he encouraged her. &ldquo;They will need the Lady of Winterfell.&rdquo;</p><p>He made an\neffort to remember what would be expected of him. He took her hand, pressed it,\nand moved the muscles that made him smile. </p><p>&ldquo;We have a\nchance. I know you will manage well. Send more people to guard me, once the\nWalkers come.&rdquo;</p><p>He rested\nhis hand on the direwolf&rsquo;s head again. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll\nknow when we need the wolves,&rdquo; he told Arya.</p><p>Bran knew\nthat he would look as if life had left him but sitting at the weirwood and\ndiving into the wisdom that awaited him was the only time he felt alive now. He\nknew that he was living other people&rsquo;s lives, that he felt other people&rsquo;s love\nand yet all that at the same time made him dizzy and hungry for more at the\nsame time. Knowledge and wisdom were his. It was a blessing and a burden. He\ncould try to act at the right time from what he knew, and yet he never had the\nfeeling he knew enough. His thirst could not be quenched and yet he had to\nwatch himself so that he would not drown. Meera eyed him, a worried look on her\nface. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve\ntalked about this. I&rsquo;ll manage,&rdquo; he told her. </p><p>The worry\ndid not leave her face, but he pushed that away and delved into the swirling\nimages that came when he touched the weirwood.</p><p>It was not\nthat difficult to get hold of Jon with Ghost by his side. His cousin&rsquo;s thoughts\nwere set on Winterfell and it was easy to contain the dragon&rsquo;s thoughts by\nchanneling the image of the dark and humid earth around the weirwood tree. But\nBran knew he had many tasks ahead and the steady hammering of his heart that\nbeat through the images was fast. In some of his tasks he probably would fail.\nStill he had to try. </p><p>Jon settled\non the dragon, and the others were climbing on. He and Jon had worked well\ntogether, one task was done. As if in a distinct murmur Bran heard Jaime\nLannister joking about Aegon the Reluctant and his banner, just when he left\nRhaegal&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>In a short\nflick he concentrated on Nymeria. His sister&rsquo;s big direwolf was easy as well.\nAlthough Arya had made a face everytime Bran had told her to reach her wolf\nBran could feel that their connection was stronger and was still growing\nstronger. He only had to nudge a little. The wolf was already bound for\nWinterfell in a fast pace. It was good that she had been North of the Neck\nalready, when Bran had reached out to her weeks ago. The wolf had already\nsensed Arya and followed her. Nymeria would be here soon. </p><p>He sent his\nmind further North, carefully and stealthily so that his enemy would not sense\nhim. He was a thin tendril of smoke, a feather on the wind, high in the air.\nBran could feel the Wall, but it felt different. Not like the strong structure\nit had been, not like the taut bowstring it had been when he had passed the\nWall. The tension was gone, the Wall was breached, Bran could see the army of\nthe dead flooding through the wall, their strides slow but with a dogged intent\nset on the path to Winterfell. The wights&rsquo; masters were driving them onwards relentlessly.</p><p>Bran\nretreated and chided himself for checking what he had known would happen. Bran\nknew that he was postponing the inevitable. The other dragon. He was south of\nthe neck, he had a strong connection to his mother, and the indifference of a\nhuge predator to smaller beings. But Bran had to try, for several reasons.</p><p>He rooted\nhimself deeply into the weirwood and reached out, stretching himself thin,\nentering the pit of fire that was Drogon&rsquo;s mind. A red and gold furnace that\nwas beautiful and dangerous, so dangerous. He stayed in the background and\nlistened.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I will have my revenge on Cersei. She tried to\ncontrol my dragons, I&rsquo;ll see her pay for that.&rdquo; </i>Daenerys insisted. Her words were muffled in\nthe dragon&rsquo;s mind. Tyrion Lannister was standing at her side, his figure small\nbefore the huge dragon. He looked very unhappy. Daenerys reached up and petted\nthe dragon. Bran would not have understood the words, if he had not seen this\nscene several times already, always looking for the loophole, the breach in the\nwall, the opportunity to give a nudge to the scales to that they would swing\nanother way.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Your Grace, you saw that the dragons are not\ninvincible. It is a great risk you want to take.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Through the\ndragon&rsquo;s mind Bran could feel the barely contained anger of the dragon&rsquo;s\nmother. </p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fly to the Red Keep on Drogon and set\nfire to it. We haven&rsquo;t been using the dragons to our best advantage. We burnt\nsome carts, harassed our enemies. It is not enough. I will have her yield.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Daenerys\ndid not shout, but her cheeks were red from excitement, and her chest was\nheaving. </p><p><i>&ldquo;And when I have returned, and Cersei is dead,\nwe will see about this King in the North. He&rsquo;ll bend the knee then! I&rsquo;m done\nwith waiting.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Drogon&rsquo;s\nmind wandered to his brother then, Rhaegal, Bran could feel it. Unlike the\nqueen, the dragon knew that Rhaegal had a connection to another human than his\nmother. It was a vague unsettling feeling in the dragon&rsquo;s mind and quickly Bran\nthought of the wind under Rhaegal&rsquo;s wings, the feeling of freedom. He wove this\ninto Drogon&rsquo;s mind in thin gossamer threads not stronger than a spider&rsquo;s web. </p><p>Drogon\nstopped scratching the earth with his claw in his unrest about his brother,\nreassured by the images of flying. Bran distracted him from the earthy smell of\nthe weirwood. Bran did not allow himself to sigh in relief that Drogon would\nnot go looking for Rhaegal. When he concentrated on the humans again, the\ndiscussion had gone on.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Your grace, please, this is too dangerous.\nThere are still caches of wildfire under the ground in King&rsquo;s Landing.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Daenerys\nsnorted, her face a grimace<i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just\nignite the Red Keep and execute Cersei.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tyrion&rsquo;s\nvoice was high-pitched in agitation<i> &ldquo;Your\ngrace, many people might die.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Then they should not have sided with the wrong\nqueen. It is time to take what is mine</i>.&rdquo; She turned from her Hand and beckoned the\ndragon to her. </p><p><i>&ldquo;You make me almost think that you want to\nprotect the sister that wanted you dead.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Bran\ninhaled the rich sent of the black humid earth at the weirwood tree and\nprepared for fighting. Where is the breach, there must be a breach! He dug his\nheels in.</p><p>When\nDaenerys had mounted her dragon, he would not take wings. Bran flooded his\nbrain with images of the earth of Winterfell. </p><p>But what\nhad worked with Rhaegal would not work with Drogon. Bran had no connection to\nthe rider and even if he had, the fire of her thoughts fed Drogon&rsquo;s mind until\nthe flames of her anger flared his. The dragon&rsquo;s mind became a roaring furnace\nthat was burning in white hot flames and Bran had to leave. There were still fights\nahead. He had to spare some of his strength.</p><p>He had\nknown it all along, and yet he felt tears on his cheeks, when he felt someone\nshake him. He opened his eyes and drank thirstily when Podrick offered him\nwater. His throat felt parched. He would have closed his eyes again, but\nPodrick insisted that he ate as well.</p><p>He let Winterfell\nfall back again and sent his mind south again. The person he wanted to reach\nnow was easier. Theon was no stranger to the weirwood after all. But Theon&rsquo;s\nmind had other pitfalls. </p><p>At least he\nhad not wasted too much time in his effort to hold Daenerys back. He slipped\ninto Theon&rsquo;s mind when he just pulled a hood over his head. He held the hand of\nhis sister Yara who did not look like she was in good shape. Theon turned and\nhelped his sister to pull her hood up as well. </p><p>&ldquo;We have to\nhurry.&rdquo;</p><p>Yara\ngritted her teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage&rdquo;.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Theon&rdquo;,</i> Bran whispered. Theon shook his head as if a\nfly had buzzed by. <i>&ldquo;Theon&rdquo;, </i>Bran\nwhispered again. Theon tapped his ear, a puzzled look on his face. <i>&ldquo;Theon&rdquo;, </i>Bran tried to shout. He\nglimpsed Podrick who was staring at him open-mouthed. He must have shouted in\nWinterfell.</p><p>Theon still\nhad not reacted other than mistrusting the sounds he heard. </p><p>&ldquo;Hurry, we\nmust hurry.&rdquo; He urged Yara forward.</p><p>Bran sent a\nshort flash of an image into Theon&rsquo;s mind. He had thought long and hard on what\nthis image could be, something that would not remind Theon of the times he was\ntortured and would yet remind him of Winterfell. </p><p><i>It was summer, a hot day. Theon held a bow in\nhis hand and was taking aim. Robb urged him on, shouting on the top of his\nlung, telling him where to aim next. Both were laughing.</i></p><p>Theon\nstopped in his tracks. <i>&ldquo;Theon&rdquo;, </i>Bran\nwhispered again.<i> </i></p><p>&ldquo;What is\nit?&rdquo; Yara wanted to know.</p><p>&ldquo;Robb&hellip;.\nWinterfell&hellip;&rdquo;. Theon&rsquo;s voice was as flimsy as the rustling of leaves.</p><p>Yara\nfrowned.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Theon, listen and watch!&rdquo;</i> He lured him in, he sent him the\nsense of Winterfell, the leaves rustling in the weirwood leaves, the sun\nglistening in the pool below the Weirwood, the smell of the earth. In another\nworld, or maybe in some other time, Theon came closer, his eyes wary, suddenly\nrealising that Bran was there.</p><p>&ldquo;Bran, you\nare alive!&rdquo;</p><p>Bran looked\nat himself and Theon from above. Fog was dancing around their feet. Theon had\nreached Bran. Just in the moment he recoiled when he saw that Bran&rsquo;s eyes were\nall white, Bran snatched at his hand. &ldquo;Learn! Watch! This is the future!&rdquo;</p><p>Bran sent\nhim images in a quick order. Theon and Yara, running through the streets of King&rsquo;s\nLanding, shouting warnings, the shadow of a dragon over the Red Keep, Balerion\nthe black dread come again, dragonfire in the keep, growing fast, the wind\npicking up the flames, the green snakes of wildfire. </p><p>Three\ntimes, he sent him the pictures, then he let go of his hand and his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,\nTheon, you are the only one who can help the people in King&rsquo;s Landing. You are\nthe only one I can reach.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran could\nnot say if Theon had heard it, because Pod was shaking him again. There was a\nchance that he would understand, a chance, but Bran would not know before Theon\ncame North again. </p><p>Meera\ninsisted that he drank more. Bran felt his cheeks and was surprised to find\ntears. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you\nsucceed?&rdquo; Meera asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,\nno, partly, maybe.&rdquo; He shrugged. They had discussed his course of action on\ntheir way to Winterfell, again and again.</p><p>&ldquo;You\nalready look exhausted,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must make time for a small break.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Later&rdquo;.</p><p>He delved\ninto the weirwood again.</p><p>&mdash;-</p><p>Rhaegal was\nwell under control, when Bran slipped into his mind again, but the dragon would\nhave to eat soon. They were flying in a light snowfall and the dragon would\nneed energy. Jon had made considerable progress and they were approaching\nRiverrun and the Lannister armies. </p><p>&ldquo;A white\nwolf on a red field with a green lizard in his mouth.&rdquo; </p><p>Jaime\nLannister was still joking about the banner, or he was at it again. Bran\ncouldn&rsquo;t tell. Judging from the way Jon pursed his lips, it was not the first\nridiculous idea the Kingslayer voiced. </p><p> &ldquo;I take a white wolf on an ice-white field\nchequered with a green dragon on a field of grass.&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s voice was flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that\nyour final decision, your grace?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon turned\naround and shot Jaime a nasty look.</p><p>&ldquo;If you\nmake one more suggestion about my banner I will throw you from this dragon,\nunderstood? Being in pain from being injured only gets you some leverage. You\ntold us yourself, that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. I want you to concentrate on\nhow you will address the armies instead.&rdquo;</p><p>Jaime\nLannister did not answer immediately, and when he finally talked again his\nvoice had lost some of his flippant tone.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t\nthought much about it. We fly some rounds over the camp. You drop me off. I\ntell them, we have a king and that we march for the rescue of Winterfell. I\nguess the dragon will be very persuasive.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon\ngrowled.</p><p>&ldquo;Think\nagain. We want this people fighting in a desperate war. We want to persuade\nthem to fight against an enemy they do not know. If I pressure them by threatening\nthem with a dragon, they will just bolt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all\ngood and noble. But they probably won&rsquo;t just overlook that there is a dragon.\nAnd even if no one saw a living dragon, they know what a dragon can do. And it\nis not as if I can hide I was burnt, even if it was not your dragon.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Jon, I&rsquo;ll show them. I can show them, at least\nfor a little while. You just have to make them stand and listen&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Jon shook\nhimself as if he was not sure what he had heard. <i>Bran, is that you?</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Trust me, Jon.&rdquo; </i></p><p>Bran could\nfeel his cousin hesitating, as is he did not trust his senses, but then he\nnodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Your\ngrace,&rdquo; Brienne interjected.</p><p>&ldquo;At the\nparley in Saltpans you showed Olyvar Frey as proof, that you left the war\nbetween the houses aside for the good of the realm. I think it would be a good\nidea, if you did something similar at Riverrun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you\nmind leading an army, Brienne?&rdquo; Jon asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;.\nBrienne was flustered. </p><p>&ldquo;You and\nSer Jaime. I need someone loyal to House Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>Brienne was\nprotesting, but Jon was intent on guiding the dragon. They had approached the\narmy now and Jon let the dragon fly several times above the heads of the\nsoldiers. </p><p>&ldquo;Olyvar,\nmaybe you could do some announcements. Wave that cloth as if you knew what is\non it.&ldquo;</p><p>When they\nhad landed, Olyvar was the first to descend. </p><p>&ldquo;Behold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men.!&rdquo;</p><p>Bran\nconcentrated on the dragon. When Jaime and Brienne descended their smell\nreached the dragon&rsquo;s noistrils and Bran was quick to deflect the dragon to Jon.\nRhaegal had been quick to adjust. He already associated the earthy smell of the\nWeirwood that Bran sent into his mind with his rider. He lowered himself on the\nground, making himself as small as a dragon could get, and set his golden eyes\nto look at Jon, an oversized dog apparently waiting on his master.</p><p>The army\nwas abuzz, and Bran could see that several officers came closer, their stance a\nmixture of wariness, awe and curiosity.</p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his hand, the golden one and pointed at Jon.</p><p>&ldquo;Behold!\nKing Aegon, sixth of his name, King of the Andals and the First Men!&rdquo; he\nshouted.</p><p>Jon stood\nstraight, his face a mask, serious, guarded and yet not aloof. Even Bran could\nnot have said, what his thoughts were. </p><p>Jaime\nLannister raised his voice again.</p><p>&ldquo;Prince\nRhaegar&rsquo;s son has come in the hour of our need. He has laid aside all the wars\nof the houses, so that we can face the threat that comes upon us unexpectedly\nfrom the North. We&rsquo;ll stand together against the enemy that would destroy us\nall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, Jaime\nof House Lannister, pledge my oath to King Aegon. I have promised to fight when\nhe protects the seven kingdoms.&rdquo; He sank on his knees and drew his sword with a\nflourish. Bran could almost hear the collective gasp. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Jon, tell them, and then I can show everybody\nhow things are in the North.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon waited\na moment before he accepted Jaime&rsquo;s sword. <i></i></p><p>He raised\nit above his head. </p><p>&ldquo;I pledge\nmy oath to the peace and the prosperity of all the seven kingdoms. We lay aside\nthe petty squabbles of the Game of Thrones.&rdquo;</p><p>He pointed\nat Olyvar. &ldquo;Olyvar of House Frey and Jaime of House Lannister have seen the\nthreat that awaits us all. We need to stand together! The White Walkers have\ncome again, but I know the living will fight. I know you will fight!&rdquo;</p><p>He gestured\nto the dragon and Bran acted. He slipped deep into Rhaegal&rsquo;s mind and the\ndragon rose. He pointed his head to the air and a roaring flame ascended. The\nsnow flakes melted in the heat and produced a myriad of glittering drops. Bran\npushed with all the strength he had. </p><p><i>The wall of ice rose a thousand feet and more.\nIt looked strong and unsurmountable.

He just needs someone to show they believe in him (he did get that from the LC, but he was still a steward). Also, he is relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to live under Thorne\u2019s command.  But mostly it\u2019s like, \u201cThis oldass motherfucking dragon who could have been king of the whole damn thing thinks I will be the best leader.

He just needs someone to show they believe in him (he did get that from the LC, but he was still a steward). Also, he is relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to live under Thorne\u2019s command.

He just needs someone to show they believe in him (he did get that from the LC, but he was still a steward). Also, he is relieved that he doesn\u2019t have to live under Thorne\u2019s command.

He just needs someone to show they believe in him (he did get that from the LC, but he was still a steward). Also, he is relieved that he doesn&rsquo;t have to live under Thorne&rsquo;s command.  But mostly it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;This oldass motherfucking dragon who could have been king of the whole damn thing thinks I will be the best leader. That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>Aemon&rsquo;s sitting back like a proud granddad. Jon&rsquo;s proud and humbled. Somewhere above, Ned Stark and Prince Baegar are beaming with pride because if no one is gonna tell the boy he&rsquo;s actually the rightful king, at least he can be the biggest shield guarding the realms of men.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here&rsquo;s to you, Maester Aemon, and you, King Crow!</p></p>",
