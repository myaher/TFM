He pushed his weight  against her, forcing rough kisses on eager lips. While restraining her small wrists with his grip in one hand he creeped the other under her white tank top, taking a feel of her firm breast. Natasha&rsquo;s lips climbed into a smile. She loved a man who thought himself strong enough to take her power from her. </p><p>&ldquo;Think you got me?&rdquo; she asked as Clint bit the side of her neck. He lifted his face to meet hers. </p><p>&ldquo;Got you? Baby you&rsquo;ve been got.&rdquo; His voice was triumphant as he and Natasha had been throwing their power around the hotel room for the last twenty minutes and he felt he had finally won. </p><p>Natasha slid her tongue into his mouth and his broad bare torso leaned onto her. She lifted her legs, gripping him with strong thighs. He freed her hands which she used to grab his back, sliding her nails down as his hands grabbed her from her under. He turned, dropping her on the bed. She kept her legs locked around him and propped her self up to meet his eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Still think you got me?&rdquo; Her voice was mischievous. Clint quickly realized his mistake. His eyes grew big and he braced himself for impact. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; </p><p>Natasha used her weight to throw him around with her hips. Clint found himself a victim of those legs he loved so much. She straddled him while pulling her tank top over her head. She grabbed a handful of his hair and turned his face away from her. She kissed up his neck and whispered into his ear &ldquo;I win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The hell you do!&rdquo; Argued Clint. He grabbed her by the neck. He knew this would not only arouse his partner but give him the upper hand in their game. With a firm but careful grip his fingers wrapped her neck and he tossed her on the pillows, nearly hitting the headboard. </p><p>Natsha laughed as he reached for the strings of her thong and immediately yanked them below her hips and down her legs. She grabbed a pillow, throwing it at him but missed and knocked over the lamp on the nightstand. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark what was that?&rdquo; Asked Peter in the hotel room next door. </p><p>&ldquo;Whose room is on that side?&rdquo; Inquired Tony going through emails on his phone. </p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s Clint&rsquo;s and Natasha&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; He had a tone of worry as the sound of things breaking never seemed good to him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s alot of weird banging in their room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No kidding&rdquo; scoffed Tony.</p><p>&ldquo; Should I go check it out?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Tony nonchalantly laid on the bed flicking his screen. It didn&rsquo;t take him long to recognize their sound of foreplay. They were quieter than usual. </p><p>Clint wasn&rsquo;t sure how he got there but he found himself naked on his knees pleasing Natasha with his tongue as she leaned back on the small office desk behind her. She moaned while he debated if he had lost or not. Natasha grabbed him from the back head, pulling him closer to her. Her moans quickened with the speed of his tongue. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a little more Barton.&rdquo; She instructed with her eyes closed and face up to the ceiling. Clint the quickly jerked away, standing in front of the now angry red head. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done with you yet.&rdquo; He said, wiping his mouth. Before Natasha could Express her annoyance Clint scooped her into his arms and walked her to the bed. With light force he tossed her on her back and she crawled backwards making room for him to join her. </p><p>Natasha bit her bottom lip as he crawled over her.

He pushed his weight  against her, forcing rough kisses on eager lips. While restraining her small wrists with his grip in one hand he creeped the other under her white tank top, taking a feel of her firm breast. Natasha\u2019s lips climbed into a smile. She loved a man who thought himself strong enough to take her power from her. </p><p>\u201cThink you got me?\u201d she asked as Clint bit the side of her neck.

She lifted her legs, gripping him with strong thighs. He freed her hands which she used to grab his back, sliding her nails down as his hands grabbed her from her under. He turned, dropping her on the bed. She kept her legs locked around him and propped her self up to meet his eyes. </p><p>\u201cStill think you got me?\u201d Her voice was mischievous. Clint quickly realized his mistake. His eyes grew big and he braced himself for impact. </p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d </p><p>Natasha used her weight to throw him around with her hips. Clint found himself a victim of those legs he loved so much. She straddled him while pulling her tank top over her head. She grabbed a handful of his hair and turned his face away from her. She kissed up his neck and whispered into his ear \u201cI win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you do!\u201d Argued Clint. He grabbed her by the neck. He knew this would not only arouse his partner but give him the upper hand in their game.

Clint continued his work, taking in the vision of her eyes fluttering, the quiver of her lip, the way her chest would raise as he steadily made his way in and out of her. </p><p>Natasha loved the way he took care of her. And everyone in the surrounding rooms knew it too. The pitch of voice raised as Clint moved quicker and quicker. She moaned and curled her toes. </p><p>&ldquo;C'mon baby, keep going.&rdquo; She motivated as she began to squirm under him. </p><p>&ldquo;Keep going? You almost there?&rdquo; He already knew the answer but he wasn&rsquo;t done making  her pouty lips move quite yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes just a little harder.&rdquo; She pleaded. </p><p>&ldquo; I mean I could.&rdquo; He taunted. &ldquo;But tell me what I want to hear first.&rdquo; His grin couldn&rsquo;t have been more devilish.</p><p>&ldquo;Barton are you kidding me?&rdquo; She desperately tried to sound more angry than aroused. </p><p>&ldquo;C'mon, just 2 little words&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; She exclaimed. She refused to give in. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok then.&rdquo; Teased Clint. He began to slow down and he watched her eyes change. He knew not to keep Natasha from something she wanted. Especially in bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Clint if you keep me from getting off I will kill you myself.&rdquo; She threatened in the most desperate tone he had ever heard. He had her. </p><p>&ldquo;Then give me those magic words.&rdquo; He timed everything just right.  For the first time ever Natasha lost. </p><p>&ldquo;Fine Barton&hellip;you win.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn straight I do!&rdquo; Clint then picked up speed and all the tension, the build up, everything they had been craving was in that very moment. He watched as her face flushed a light red and his muscles intensified for just a moment as they climaxed in an orchestrated unity. Natasha gave a final cry of relief, his favorite sound. </p><p>Clint rolled off of her body and laid next to her, panting but happy. </p><p>&ldquo;I finally won.&rdquo; He bragged.  </p><p>&ldquo;Hey winner, I&rsquo;m telling Tony you broke the lamp so you have to pay for it.&rdquo; She argued back. </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;..fuck&rdquo;</p></p>",
