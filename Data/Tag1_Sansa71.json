        "body": "<h1>sansa stark does not owe daenerys shit</h1><p>sansa has earned the respect of everyone in the north, simply by being nice to them and respecting their choices. she has proved to be a competent and powerful leader by making sure they had enough food in storage and making sure everyone had a place to go in the form of winterfell. the biggest castle in the north. d@ny did literally none of that. she \u2018freed\u2019 slaves yeah, but did they have a place to go? did she make sure they had somewhere to go? nope. d@ny is intimidating because she has dragons. that\u2019s the only reason. other than the dragons, if d@ny is alone she has nothing. she doesn\u2019t fight. she has no way to defend herself other than the dragons and the armies. she has at least one soldier with her at all times. they don\u2019t trust in her because she\u2019s a good queen, they \u201ctrust and believe in her\u2019 because she\u2019s intimidating with those dragons. she has given no reason for them to believe in her other than \u2018freeing\u2019 them. people who now serve her. if they are free they shouldn\u2019t have to SERVE her. </p><p>now Sansa, she has people at her back because they ginuinely BELIEVE AND TRUST in her. she has showed them why they should. she is 20 years old taking care of an entire kingdom basically on her own. no she isn\u2019t doing the physical work, she\u2019s a lady. she has people under her that will do that work for her. but she is taking care of the numbers, the paperwork. she\u2019s making sure everything is in order and i know i\u2019m repeating myself a lot but she\u2019s making sure people have a place of refuge in the time of imminent war. she has an entire household who lives at winterfell and she is still taking people in. she has people guarding winter town making sure the small folk are protected. SHE IS MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS PROTECTED. she feeds everyone. i have no doubt that she\u2019s like her father in the aspect that she invited the town folk to sit at her table. she\u2019s a highborn lady and i honestly feel that she doesn\u2019t act like a highborn in the aspect that she thinks she\u2019s better than everyone a la cersei and d@ny. she\u2019s humble. i can honestly say that i believe sansa spends more time with the small folk in her free time than she does in winterfell. when she sent little ned umber back to last hearth, people believe she sent him alone. she literally told him to take all the wagons that they could spare, he can\u2019t take multiple wagons alone so i am positive she sent soldiers with him. at least a small armada, maybe like 100 men. the only person we saw that died was little ned. how do you think that\u2019s going to make sansa feel? he was younger and smaller than Rickon. we didn\u2019t see sansa mourn her baby brother. imagine how she\u2019s going to take the news that that baby boy has died. one that was basically under her care at that point. that is going to hit her hard. she\u2019s a master at hiding her feelings at this point but when she\u2019s alone? nah she\u2019s going to break down for that kid. now why is this relevant? because he was one of her allies. he trusted her and she failed him. </p><p>as bran said in season one: \u201cwhy would we expect them to fight for us if we do not fight for them?\u201d</p><p>d@ny did absolutely nothing to aid her allies in their time of need. the sand snakes were massacred. ellaria and tyene captures and left to die. yara kidnapped and held captive and dany was more worried about a battle that one of her armies had under control and instead of going to help she went to burn their food. food she could\u2019ve used to feed the armies she was worried about feeding. but no you burn it. now not only are your allies gone, but you have no food. you have no worries about the people that have pledged to help you. she had no proof that ellaria, the sand snakes, olenna and yara were dead. hell theon came back but instead of waiting to hear that her allies were indeed dead, she flew off to fight a battle that she\u2019d already lost. she\u2019s an imcompetent child and she acts like a child that got their candy taken away. </p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">hell Joffrey was a better ruler than D@ny and i stand by that. @ me if you wanna i will debate that until i die. </span></p><p>now back to the topic as to why Sansa doesn\u2019t owe d@ny anything. She has given sansa no reason to trust her. jon went to dragonstone to broker an alliance and came back months later. instead you kept him hostage for MONTHS. kept him from seeing his family, people he thought were dead. being \u201cthe last targaryen\u201d you should know how it feels to truly be alone in the world. that conversation should\u2019ve taken 20 minutes at most. </p><p>\u201cwill you help fight the dead that will wipe us out if we fail? you can burn them with your dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201calright bet.\u201d</p><p>jon didn\u2019t need to kneel to her for her to agree to fight. all she had to do was say yes. </p><p>not to mention that she is a hypocrite. she asked jon not to judge her for the actions of her ancestors but you\u2019re going to hold him to the fact that torrhen stark knelt and ask him to do the same. first of all get your facts right, torrhen was not the last king in the north, Robb Stark was and the only reason he isn\u2019t now is because he was so great and powerful that one of his own bannermen had to plan a mutiny to murder him because tywin lannister was fucking threatened by a 17 year old boy who had just had sex for the first time. (lol i\u2019m getting off topic)</p><p>you came to the north and was upset that no one liked you, like jon said, they don\u2019t know you. and when they do get to know you they still won\u2019t like you because the northmen are arguably the most clear and levelheaded of the seven kingdoms, they don\u2019t give a fuck who sits on the iron throne. now you come in and make it known that that is all you want they\u2019re going to dismiss you as just another southerner. jon even told her, northerners don\u2019t like outsiders. you came to this country and claimed it as yours. you come to the north and claim it as yours. you have the other 6 kingdoms and you wanna get greedy. instead of introducing yourself you let your dragons intimidate everyone. you come into winterfell expecting to be respected. they don\u2019t owe you anything. they don\u2019t know you. what have you dont for them except basically strip their king of his ONE title. he\u2019s a damn bastard and has no titles, you knew this and took the one title he had that made him \u201cworth\u201d something. he told you when he got there that he was a bastard. (incase you need a recap, bastards hold no inheritance and have no titles or claim to lands.) he may have grew up in winterfell but he has absolutely no claim to it. she took the ONE thing he had to boost her own damn ego. Her court had no idea what a bastard was as evidenced by Missandei, as they are not from westeros. all they knew was that he was the son of a lord. they probably assumed he held land, titles and a holdfast. </p><p>so you came into winterfell expecting to be boarded and fed. unlike you, sansa cares about her people and has them in winterfell eating the food for the people she accounted for. you brought two armies and two dragons but no food. and you\u2019re expecting me to feed you. arguably 50% of the people sansa had already accounted for. you\u2019ve put more food on her plate so to speak. and then the dragons.</p><p>\u201cwhat do dragons eat anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhatever they want.\u201d</p><p>you have basically just told her that if your dragons eat something/someone then you\u2019ll just have to deal with it. </p><p>you don\u2019t automatically get respect in the north. you have to earn it. </p><h2><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\"><b>TL;DR</b></span></h2><h2>sansa stark needs to give d@ny her epi pen and tell her to get the fuck outta her house. </h2>",

SHE IS MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS PROTECTED. she feeds everyone. i have no doubt that she\u2019s like her father in the aspect that she invited the town folk to sit at her table. she\u2019s a highborn lady and i honestly feel that she doesn\u2019t act like a highborn in the aspect that she thinks she\u2019s better than everyone a la cersei and d@ny. she\u2019s humble. i can honestly say that i believe sansa spends more time with the small folk in her free time than she does in winterfell. when she sent little ned umber back to last hearth, people believe she sent him alone. she literally told him to take all the wagons that they could spare, he can\u2019t take multiple wagons alone so i am positive she sent soldiers with him. at least a small armada, maybe like 100 men. the only person we saw that died was little ned. how do you think that\u2019s going to make sansa feel? he was younger and smaller than Rickon. we didn\u2019t see sansa mourn her baby brother. imagine how she\u2019s going to take the news that that baby boy has died. one that was basically under her care at that point. that is going to hit her hard. she\u2019s a master at hiding her feelings at this point but when she\u2019s alone? nah she\u2019s going to break down for that kid. now why is this relevant? because he was one of her allies. he trusted her and she failed him. </p><p>as bran said in season one: \u201cwhy would we expect them to fight for us if we do not fight for them?\u201d</p><p>d@ny did absolutely nothing to aid her allies in their time of need. the sand snakes were massacred. ellaria and tyene captures and left to die. yara kidnapped and held captive and dany was more worried about a battle that one of her armies had under control and instead of going to help she went to burn their food. food she could\u2019ve used to feed the armies she was worried about feeding. but no you burn it. now not only are your allies gone, but you have no food. you have no worries about the people that have pledged to help you. she had no proof that ellaria, the sand snakes, olenna and yara were dead. hell theon came back but instead of waiting to hear that her allies were indeed dead, she flew off to fight a battle that she\u2019d already lost. she\u2019s an imcompetent child and she acts like a child that got their candy taken away. </p><p><span class=\"npf_color_joey\">hell Joffrey was a better ruler than D@ny and i stand by that. @ me if you wanna i will debate that until i die. </span></p><p>now back to the topic as to why Sansa doesn\u2019t owe d@ny anything. She has given sansa no reason to trust her. jon went to dragonstone to broker an alliance and came back months later. instead you kept him hostage for MONTHS. kept him from seeing his family, people he thought were dead. being \u201cthe last targaryen\u201d you should know how it feels to truly be alone in the world. that conversation should\u2019ve taken 20 minutes at most. </p><p>\u201cwill you help fight the dead that will wipe us out if we fail? you can burn them with your dragons.\u201d</p><p>\u201calright bet.\u201d</p><p>jon didn\u2019t need to kneel to her for her to agree to fight. all she had to do was say yes. </p><p>not to mention that she is a hypocrite. she asked jon not to judge her for the actions of her ancestors but you\u2019re going to hold him to the fact that torrhen stark knelt and ask him to do the same. first of all get your facts right, torrhen was not the last king in the north, Robb Stark was and the only reason he isn\u2019t now is because he was so great and powerful that one of his own bannermen had to plan a mutiny to murder him because tywin lannister was fucking threatened by a 17 year old boy who had just had sex for the first time. (lol i\u2019m getting off topic)</p><p>you came to the north and was upset that no one liked you, like jon said, they don\u2019t know you. and when they do get to know you they still won\u2019t like you because the northmen are arguably the most clear and levelheaded of the seven kingdoms, they don\u2019t give a fuck who sits on the iron throne. now you come in and make it known that that is all you want they\u2019re going to dismiss you as just another southerner. jon even told her, northerners don\u2019t like outsiders. you came to this country and claimed it as yours. you come to the north and claim it as yours. you have the other 6 kingdoms and you wanna get greedy. instead of introducing yourself you let your dragons intimidate everyone. you come into winterfell expecting to be respected. they don\u2019t owe you anything. they don\u2019t know you. what have you dont for them except basically strip their king of his ONE title. he\u2019s a damn bastard and has no titles, you knew this and took the one title he had that made him \u201cworth\u201d something. he told you when he got there that he was a bastard. (incase you need a recap, bastards hold no inheritance and have no titles or claim to lands.) he may have grew up in winterfell but he has absolutely no claim to it. she took the ONE thing he had to boost her own damn ego. Her court had no idea what a bastard was as evidenced by Missandei, as they are not from westeros. all they knew was that he was the son of a lord. they probably assumed he held land, titles and a holdfast. </p><p>so you came into winterfell expecting to be boarded and fed. unlike you, sansa cares about her people and has them in winterfell eating the food for the people she accounted for. you brought two armies and two dragons but no food. and you\u2019re expecting me to feed you. arguably 50% of the people sansa had already accounted for. you\u2019ve put more food on her plate so to speak. and then the dragons.</p><p>\u201cwhat do dragons eat anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhatever they want.\u201d</p><p>you have basically just told her that if your dragons eat something/someone then you\u2019ll just have to deal with it. </p><p>you don\u2019t automatically get respect in the north. you have to earn it. </p><h2><span class=\"npf_color_rachel\"><b>TL;DR</b></span></h2><h2>sansa stark needs to give d@ny her epi pen and tell her to get the fuck outta her house. </h2></p>",

I don\u2019t think too many people watching the first season had any expectation that Sansa would become the woman that she became. And part of that is the story and part of that is Sophie Turner and the phenom she turned out to be as an actress. We knew when we cast Sophie that she was this really good child actor but we had no idea she\u2019d become the force that\u2019s she\u2019s become. So if I had to pick one, I\u2019d pick Sansa.",
