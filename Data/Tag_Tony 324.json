She had always been fond of him and that a man like him would even bother with someone like her made her feel more confident than ever.</p><p>The only problem was that she gradually felt herself fall for him and the feeling was overwhelming, to say the least.

So, she did what she could do best; avoid the problem as much as possible and if said problem gets confrontational, just walk away.</p><p>In the past two weeks though, she started acting like a teenager with their first crush. She blushed any time he touched her and giggled in an annoying pitch when he made a comment that wasn\u2019t even that funny.</p><p>She felt like she was losing control and didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>For some reason, she also felt like Tony knew something about her that he shouldn\u2019t.

He crossed one arm and propped the other up, so his glass rested against his lips.</p><p>Y/N turned around, her eyes on the floor as she didn\u2019t want to crumble beneath Tony\u2019s intense gaze just yet. She knew that as soon as she looked up and met his striking dark eyes, she would start acting like that version of herself she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>But while she took the tiniest sips from her beer, she felt his eyes burn a hole into her forehead. The silence between them was deafening and it caused her to shift from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Tony\u2019s question caught her off-guard and a confused frown appeared on her face. Besides, the question was nothing but odd, why would she be hurt? The last mission she went on was a success and nobody received more than a few scratches.</p><p>She slowly let her eyes meet his, letting them trail over his body beforehand. She let herself admire the way his thighs looked in the form-fitting jeans and how the veins in his arms stood out.</p><p>She had to stop herself from drooling and when she finally looked at him, she put up her walls. Her back straightened as she tried to make herself appear more confident.</p><p>As part of her act, she rolled her eyes at him and crossed her arms over her chest as she answered, \u201cLet me guess when I fell from heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d Her eyebrows creased in confusion once more as she leaned in his direction a little.</p><p>In return, Tony only grinned while taking another sip of his Scotch, \u201cDid it hurt when you fell for me?\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost dropped her beer as a thousand different emotions ran through her veins, some almost making her heart stop beating while others almost caused it to drop into her pants.</p><p>Her eyes were wide like saucers as they darted from Tony\u2019s face to the rest of his body and behind him. She didn\u2019t know what to do with herself or what to say so she opted for opening and closing her mouth like a fish on land.</p><p>Tony, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t bothered by anything in the slightest at the moment. He was just glad Y/N reacted the way she did. Otherwise, this would\u2019ve been the most humiliating thing he went through in the time he lived on this earth \u2013 and that was a lot coming from Tony Stark himself.</p><p>\u201cHow did you- Who- What?\u201d Y/N managed to stutter out causing Tony to chuckle and move away from the kitchen isle he was leaning against. He took a few steps towards her, keeping a close eye on her body language.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he answered, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cyou just told me yourself,\u201d A smirk played on his lips as he watched her jaw hit the floor. But it disappeared as soon as he took notice of the glint in her eyes.</p><p>Anger, frustration and hurt \u2013 those were the emotions Tony saw flash behind her beautiful eyes.</p><p>He immediately felt regret run through his head, almost dizzying him in the process. He didn\u2019t intend to humiliate her the way he probably did just now, he was never good at letting people know about his emotions and now she would turn her back on him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you got the entertainment you were looking from this,\u201d she mumbled in a frighteningly calm tone making Tony hit himself in his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do this to entertain myself,\u201d he sighed, setting his glass down on the kitchen isle behind him. He took a deep breath through his nose while his blood started to pulse faster through his veins.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d She whispered, her arms crossing tighter over her chest making her body take on a defensive stance.</p><p>Tony reached out his hand, touching her cheek and breathing a sigh of relief when she didn\u2019t slap it away or flinch. His other lifted slowly until he was cupping her face, her skin soft against his calloused hands while he rubbed his thumb over the apples of her cheeks.</p><p>Tony brought his own face closer to hers, their noses bumping together and closed his eyes for a second. He breathed in her scent and revelled in the warmth radiating off of her.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, she was already looking at him with an expecting expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>His shoulders tensed when he heard a small gasp leave her mouth. But it wasn\u2019t a bad one, her face displayed nothing but joy and love for the man standing in front of her.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, Y/N decided to throw her arms around his neck and close the gap between their mouths. Tony\u2019s breath stilled for a second but it almost went unnoticed by her as a second later he started kissing her back with the equal amount of passion.</p><p>She smiled against his lips, the part of herself she didn\u2019t like melting away with the heat the kiss possessed.</p><p><i>&mdash;</i></p><p><i>Feel free to leave a message or ask if you wanna be added to my taglist!</i></p><p><b><i>Taglist: </i></b><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJq-eoonykR-dTQXvOpi-HQ\">@thatsunacceptable</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHiWIvrecC3XOqmZzM6U5rg\">@jitterbuck</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH453YlOosB8xU6p4AZ278w\">@kuro-no-kenshi</a></i></p>",

Her laughter ceased when she felt the back of her head tingle and an odd sensation ran down her spine.</p><p>She knew the feeling all too well and was pretty sure she knew who caused it as well.</p><p>Emptying her beer in one swig, she stood up from the couch and shook the bottle in her hands to signal Sam she needed another one to which he gave a curt nod, a small, knowing smirk appearing on his face.</p><p>Y/N let out a sigh and turned around, noticing that Tony stood by the kitchen isle with a glass of scotch in his hand. His other hand rested atop the counter while his eyes found hers causing the corner of his lips to quirk.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him as she started making her way towards the fridge. Tony had been acting strange towards as of late and she was yet to find out what the reason was.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t acting strangely in a bad way \u2013 quite the contrary, actually. He seemed to sit closer to her during dinner or movie nights and he let his innocent touches linger longer than before, sometimes even rubbing his thumb over whatever body part he was touching.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t mind the attention she got from the handsome billionaire in the slightest. She had always been fond of him and that a man like him would even bother with someone like her made her feel more confident than ever.</p><p>The only problem was that she gradually felt herself fall for him and the feeling was overwhelming, to say the least. She didn\u2019t like to deal with anything that concerned her feelings or whatever else was going on in her heart.</p><p>To be honest, she was more of a brain person.</p><p>But then her brain also started telling her that she was falling for Tony, the thought playing in her head like a broken record. So, she did what she could do best; avoid the problem as much as possible and if said problem gets confrontational, just walk away.</p><p>In the past two weeks though, she started acting like a teenager with their first crush. She blushed any time he touched her and giggled in an annoying pitch when he made a comment that wasn\u2019t even that funny.</p><p>She felt like she was losing control and didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>For some reason, she also felt like Tony knew something about her that he shouldn\u2019t. The way one of his eyebrows rose in an anticipatory manner and how he licked his lips anytime he looked her way told her as much.</p><p>As she grabbed another beer from the fridge, she didn\u2019t notice that Tony had turned around to face her while he watched her get lost in her thoughts. He crossed one arm and propped the other up, so his glass rested against his lips.</p><p>Y/N turned around, her eyes on the floor as she didn\u2019t want to crumble beneath Tony\u2019s intense gaze just yet. She knew that as soon as she looked up and met his striking dark eyes, she would start acting like that version of herself she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>But while she took the tiniest sips from her beer, she felt his eyes burn a hole into her forehead. The silence between them was deafening and it caused her to shift from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Tony\u2019s question caught her off-guard and a confused frown appeared on her face. Besides, the question was nothing but odd, why would she be hurt? The last mission she went on was a success and nobody received more than a few scratches.</p><p>She slowly let her eyes meet his, letting them trail over his body beforehand. She let herself admire the way his thighs looked in the form-fitting jeans and how the veins in his arms stood out.</p><p>She had to stop herself from drooling and when she finally looked at him, she put up her walls. Her back straightened as she tried to make herself appear more confident.</p><p>As part of her act, she rolled her eyes at him and crossed her arms over her chest as she answered, \u201cLet me guess when I fell from heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d Her eyebrows creased in confusion once more as she leaned in his direction a little.</p><p>In return, Tony only grinned while taking another sip of his Scotch, \u201cDid it hurt when you fell for me?\u201d</p><p>Y/N almost dropped her beer as a thousand different emotions ran through her veins, some almost making her heart stop beating while others almost caused it to drop into her pants.</p><p>Her eyes were wide like saucers as they darted from Tony\u2019s face to the rest of his body and behind him. She didn\u2019t know what to do with herself or what to say so she opted for opening and closing her mouth like a fish on land.</p><p>Tony, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t bothered by anything in the slightest at the moment. He was just glad Y/N reacted the way she did. Otherwise, this would\u2019ve been the most humiliating thing he went through in the time he lived on this earth \u2013 and that was a lot coming from Tony Stark himself.</p><p>\u201cHow did you- Who- What?\u201d Y/N managed to stutter out causing Tony to chuckle and move away from the kitchen isle he was leaning against. He took a few steps towards her, keeping a close eye on her body language.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he answered, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cyou just told me yourself,\u201d A smirk played on his lips as he watched her jaw hit the floor. But it disappeared as soon as he took notice of the glint in her eyes.</p><p>Anger, frustration and hurt \u2013 those were the emotions Tony saw flash behind her beautiful eyes.</p><p>He immediately felt regret run through his head, almost dizzying him in the process. He didn\u2019t intend to humiliate her the way he probably did just now, he was never good at letting people know about his emotions and now she would turn her back on him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you got the entertainment you were looking from this,\u201d she mumbled in a frighteningly calm tone making Tony hit himself in his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t do this to entertain myself,\u201d he sighed, setting his glass down on the kitchen isle behind him. He took a deep breath through his nose while his blood started to pulse faster through his veins.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d She whispered, her arms crossing tighter over her chest making her body take on a defensive stance.</p><p>Tony reached out his hand, touching her cheek and breathing a sigh of relief when she didn\u2019t slap it away or flinch. His other lifted slowly until he was cupping her face, her skin soft against his calloused hands while he rubbed his thumb over the apples of her cheeks.</p><p>Tony brought his own face closer to hers, their noses bumping together and closed his eyes for a second. He breathed in her scent and revelled in the warmth radiating off of her.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, she was already looking at him with an expecting expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>His shoulders tensed when he heard a small gasp leave her mouth. But it wasn\u2019t a bad one, her face displayed nothing but joy and love for the man standing in front of her.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, Y/N decided to throw her arms around his neck and close the gap between their mouths. Tony\u2019s breath stilled for a second but it almost went unnoticed by her as a second later he started kissing her back with the equal amount of passion.</p><p>She smiled against his lips, the part of herself she didn\u2019t like melting away with the heat the kiss possessed.</p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p><i>Feel free to leave a message or ask if you wanna be added to my taglist!</i></p><p><b><i>Taglist: </i></b><i><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJq-eoonykR-dTQXvOpi-HQ\">@thatsunacceptable</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHiWIvrecC3XOqmZzM6U5rg\">@jitterbuck</a> - <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mH453YlOosB8xU6p4AZ278w\">@kuro-no-kenshi</a></i></p></p>",
