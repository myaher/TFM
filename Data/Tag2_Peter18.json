Your favorite month of the year. It was a time for celebration and embracing who you were. Yet each May when June begins approaching, you feel yourself dreading it, though you weren\u2019t sure why. Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were pan and you were afraid they would.</p><p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter\u2019s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?\u201d Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHm? Oh shit sorry Peter I zoned out.\u201d You muttered, glancing at his book and flipping the pages in yours until it matched.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You responded, hoping he\u2019d get the message and move on. He did not.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve gotta be thinking about something! You really zoned out, clearly something\u2019s on your mind!\u201d He teased, chemistry long forgotten for him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing chem?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cChem is boring, besides we\u2019ve been doing it for ages.\u201d He whined. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201c\u2018M goin\u2019 to pride.\u201d You mumbled, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d He asked, eyebrows furrowed. You nodded. A silence took over the two of you.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should consider going with someone. Just want you to be safe, is all.\u201d He finally spoke, voice soft.</p><p>You shook your head, furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhy n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pansexual!\u201d You yelled, cutting him off. Peter\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pan and no one knows. Except you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you are?\u201d He whispered, like he couldn\u2019t believe it. You nodded, your eyes on the floor. When Peter said nothing else, you panicked, beginning to grab your stuff.</p><p>\u201cUh, pretend I never said anything.

Your favorite month of the year. It was a time for celebration and embracing who you were. Yet each May when June begins approaching, you feel yourself dreading it, though you weren\u2019t sure why. Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were pan and you were afraid they would.</p><p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter\u2019s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?\u201d Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHm? Oh shit sorry Peter I zoned out.\u201d You muttered, glancing at his book and flipping the pages in yours until it matched.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You responded, hoping he\u2019d get the message and move on. He did not.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve gotta be thinking about something! You really zoned out, clearly something\u2019s on your mind!\u201d He teased, chemistry long forgotten for him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing chem?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cChem is boring, besides we\u2019ve been doing it for ages.\u201d He whined. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201c\u2018M goin\u2019 to pride.\u201d You mumbled, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d He asked, eyebrows furrowed. You nodded. A silence took over the two of you.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should consider going with someone. Just want you to be safe, is all.\u201d He finally spoke, voice soft.</p><p>You shook your head, furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhy n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pansexual!\u201d You yelled, cutting him off. Peter\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pan and no one knows. Except you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you are?\u201d He whispered, like he couldn\u2019t believe it. You nodded, your eyes on the floor. When Peter said nothing else, you panicked, beginning to grab your stuff.</p><p>\u201cUh, pretend I never said anything. I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo! No wait- Y/N wait.\u201d Peter called, following you to his front door where he stopped you from opening the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like I didn\u2019t care or anything.\u201d He started. \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d</p><p>This time it was your eyes that widened. \u201cReally?\u201d You asked. He nodded, pulling you in for a hug.</p><p>\u201c\u2018M proud of you.\u201d He muttered into your shoulder as you gripped his shirt tighter.</p><p>\u201c\u2018M proud of you too.\u201d You responded as the two of you pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWanna come to pride with me?\u201d You asked, Peter chuckling and nodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cPeter come on we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d You said, Peter mumbling an \u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d in response.</p><p>He finally emerged from his room in a bi pride t-shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cFinally. Took ya long enough.\u201d You teased as he rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He laughed, telling May the two of you would be back later before heading off to the parade.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cPeter this is awesome!\u201d You squealed, looking around at all the pride decorations on the New York City street. Peter smiled, nodding in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You just nodded, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cHey, before we get into the real fun festivities, I wanna show you something.\u201d</p><p>He pulled you off to the side to avoid getting in people\u2019s way. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He instructed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Parker?\u201d You asked as you shut your eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see just keep your eyes shut.\u201d He told you. You heard the unzipping of his small backpack, feeling something placed in your hands before you heard his bag being zipped back up. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d He instructed.</p><p>It took a minute for your eyes to adjust to the bright sun after being shut, glancing down at your hands where you saw a pan pride flag.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018S yours.\u201d He smiled as you just looked at him, the smile on your face growing. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do.\u201d You said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou can keep it at my place if you want. May knows I\u2019m bi, she\u2019ll be cool if I keep anything pride related there.\u201d</p><p>You threw yourself in his arms, squeezing him tightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you thank you thank you.\u201d You mumbled as his arms wrapped around your body.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He whispered as you two separated.</p><p>\u201cShall we go celebrate?\u201d You asked, Peter nodding. \u201cWell let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh by the way,\u201d Peter started. \u201cFigured now would be a good time to mention this. I\u2019m Spiderman.\u201d He paused, showing you the suit in his bag while you were clearly in shock, trying to process it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You gasped, finally finding your words.</p><p>\u201cNo cops at this pride, just your friendly neighborhood bisexual Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p> tags + some mutuals: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVZTWe1UaQH7s3eQsiPDpfw\">@harmfulfiz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmEgYgee3kdLU3NndUcYkhw\">@avispate</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44Dmt7xDGY9BJGt-11qX1Q\">@tintedsnowrose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS1pLdaFlUyOax36ESDqtCw\">@izzythefanfreak</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vxBi6bTUy5w6MfG8dvLhA\">@itzmegaaaaaaan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7wOdzJ8rJCuRKkaJPS3Tmg\">@biggalaxytrashcollection</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvbXKHbKPoE4QEqJpYDopgA\">@pianista-bookworm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvuUXaPIFmLprYh8RJK-kvg\">@squeakyfive</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj35CJEbKN_LdGUpw_1Iueg\">@thatshortanimegirl</a> <strike>@unicornoncrack</strike> <strike>@obsessivereader36</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPFxHY8REuuznMmvEVgTZSw\">@im-peter-bytheway</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJImvoCRjTLeJ9b-kXC5Xkg\">@thatonepanhuman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msPK2gSl972-H7sCAI0_ceg\">@anastasiaformarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPG3dCtgYjCSr9l0TsM7CAQ\">@pleasantlysecretdream</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_bjew_o6hmvY25rTGjVwaA\">@totallyreadyforthis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-l_1nAEnw1asGaHKx_Yjw\">@assbuttplaid</a><strike>@lordabby</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn24ZUmNiDnobMTsTvFaNAg\">@crxssourbones</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1Yj8U6xBJgbppYmrgN9oQ\">@anaprieto0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a><strike>@meeeeeeeeeps</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSlAYZRuXzh_5xcKI-QwRvw\">@bitchacho25</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPu3C1uGC4J7tnZ0gQ8Ghg\">@dangerousluv1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAUoKt4RJF-nbqpQs5f84VA\">@alex\u2013awesome\u201322</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzjN8EWGdAWfbhgiJdujZNg\">@gummyhoneybees</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2UWu9oPe9SeRY3OddUKxEw\">@bigmcchickenmood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0UHsI1AxsLkBOUe35FfTA\">@captainbuckyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <strike>@0oof-oof0</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSJqulxO7QybhnAJ1VXrOkQ\">@spidey-holland7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2kt74kDHqM5BU5U09mgRFA\">@13-breadsticks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\">@its-the-unknownspidey</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXk1P_lqJGTX4UXJFK1NFQQ\">@darlingxholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\">@bellamyblakemorley</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEsnslz1vUv5_Kh5P2sI3Pg\">@spiderboytotherescue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZHLoejFFyYHjgR5CnNM2ig\">@spideypeach</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu-cuKUPj0YkYMKak5wJTYQ\">@astrospideys</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOWx55aDqElM1MmP63JGuQ\">@hollandroos</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\">@loverholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\">@moonlit-void-to-the-far-unknown</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuf</a>f <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY502FLoAHXSjqkG2iiCEcg\">@tommyhollandd</a><br></p>",

I&rsquo;m Spiderman.&rdquo; He paused, showing you the suit in his bag while you were clearly in shock, trying to process it.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; You gasped, finally finding your words.</p><p>&ldquo;No cops at this pride, just your friendly neighborhood bisexual Spiderman.&rdquo;</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p> tags + some mutuals: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVZTWe1UaQH7s3eQsiPDpfw\">@harmfulfiz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmEgYgee3kdLU3NndUcYkhw\">@avispate</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44Dmt7xDGY9BJGt-11qX1Q\">@tintedsnowrose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS1pLdaFlUyOax36ESDqtCw\">@izzythefanfreak</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vxBi6bTUy5w6MfG8dvLhA\">@itzmegaaaaaaan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7wOdzJ8rJCuRKkaJPS3Tmg\">@biggalaxytrashcollection</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvbXKHbKPoE4QEqJpYDopgA\">@pianista-bookworm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvuUXaPIFmLprYh8RJK-kvg\">@squeakyfive</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj35CJEbKN_LdGUpw_1Iueg\">@thatshortanimegirl</a> <strike>@unicornoncrack</strike> <strike>@obsessivereader36</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPFxHY8REuuznMmvEVgTZSw\">@im-peter-bytheway</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJImvoCRjTLeJ9b-kXC5Xkg\">@thatonepanhuman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msPK2gSl972-H7sCAI0_ceg\">@anastasiaformarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPG3dCtgYjCSr9l0TsM7CAQ\">@pleasantlysecretdream</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_bjew_o6hmvY25rTGjVwaA\">@totallyreadyforthis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-l_1nAEnw1asGaHKx_Yjw\">@assbuttplaid</a><strike>@lordabby</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn24ZUmNiDnobMTsTvFaNAg\">@crxssourbones</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1Yj8U6xBJgbppYmrgN9oQ\">@anaprieto0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a><strike>@meeeeeeeeeps</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSlAYZRuXzh_5xcKI-QwRvw\">@bitchacho25</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPu3C1uGC4J7tnZ0gQ8Ghg\">@dangerousluv1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAUoKt4RJF-nbqpQs5f84VA\">@alex&ndash;awesome&ndash;22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzjN8EWGdAWfbhgiJdujZNg\">@gummyhoneybees</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2UWu9oPe9SeRY3OddUKxEw\">@bigmcchickenmood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0UHsI1AxsLkBOUe35FfTA\">@captainbuckyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <strike>@0oof-oof0</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSJqulxO7QybhnAJ1VXrOkQ\">@spidey-holland7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2kt74kDHqM5BU5U09mgRFA\">@13-breadsticks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\">@its-the-unknownspidey</a> &nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXk1P_lqJGTX4UXJFK1NFQQ\">@darlingxholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\">@bellamyblakemorley</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEsnslz1vUv5_Kh5P2sI3Pg\">@spiderboytotherescue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZHLoejFFyYHjgR5CnNM2ig\">@spideypeach</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu-cuKUPj0YkYMKak5wJTYQ\">@astrospideys</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOWx55aDqElM1MmP63JGuQ\">@hollandroos</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\">@loverholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\">@moonlit-void-to-the-far-unknown</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuf</a>f <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY502FLoAHXSjqkG2iiCEcg\">@tommyhollandd</a><br /></p>",

Your favorite month of the year. It was a time for celebration and embracing who you were. Yet each May when June begins approaching, you feel yourself dreading it, though you weren&rsquo;t sure why. Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were pan and you were afraid they would.</p>\n<p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p>\n<p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter&rsquo;s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?&rdquo; Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p>\n</p>",

You rushed to get water not wanting to miss the midnight texts that would come in from Ned, MJ and a few of your other friends. And especially peter. </p><p>11:59 p.m </p><p>You chugged your water down and sprinted to your room, quickly bouncing your leg up and down waiting for the clock to hit 12, you were smiling and you could feel your heart racing, excitement and adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>12:00 a.m </p><p>You sat with a smile on your face, giddy to read the texts you were expecting. Your heart beat slowly returned to normal when your notification screen remained blank. The smiling picture of peter walking towards you with a bouquet of roses staring back at you. Maybe it\u2019s the connection. </p><p>12:01 a.m</p><p>Still nothing. You felt a familiar knot in your throat and you furrowed your eyebrows, getting under your blanket and turning the lights off, the light of your phone screen illuminating your room. Still nothing. </p><p>12:13 a.m</p><p>Not a single notification. Nothing. You didn\u2019t want to cry, not when your birthday had just begun, but being forgotten by everyone? By your best friends? By <i>peter</i>? Now that <b>hurt</b>. </p><p>You locked your phone and threw it somewhere on your bed, burrying your face in your pillow and letting the hot tears fall onto the soft fabric. You cried and cried until you felt your eyes getting puffier. In one last attempt to clean your recent wounds you checked your phone. </p><p>Nothing. </p><p>Locking it one last time you let yourself cry more and more until you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open any longer. </p><p>You woke up and the memories of the pervious night flooded back you felt your chest tighten. You checked your phone and you had no notifications. Getting out of bed you went to the restroom and went through your regular morning routine. When you reached the kitchen your mother smiled sweetly at you and handed you your favorite breakfast food. </p><p>You smiled gratefully at her and slowly picked at your food. </p><p>\u201cokay spill it what\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s your birthday!\u201d She cheered nudging you lightly with her elbow. </p><p>\u201cno one texted me or even said anything, i have no notifications\u201d you mumbled eating your food and sighing. </p><p>\u201cand peter?\u201d her voice dropped an octave and her protective instinctincs were kicking in. </p><p>You shook your head and you could tell she was angry. You quickly finished eating and washed your plate. You headed to your room and changed into some yoga pants and a t shirt and grabbed your headphones. </p><p>Heading for the door you told your mom you were gonna go for a walk and you shoved your headphones in your ears, blasting them in an attempt to try and forget that all your friends and your boyfriend forgot about your birthday. You sighed as tears began to prick your eyes and you quickly wiped stray tears away and continued to walk to a small park near your house. When you reached it you saw a few kids playing with their parents and a few dogs playing fetch with their owners. </p><p>You didn\u2019t know how many times you walked the trail in the park when your mom called you to get back home because you had been out for over three hours. You sighed and made your way back home, stopping to pat a few of the dogs that approached you. </p><p>When you got home you showered and changed into some shorts and one of peters shirts. You quickly remembered that he had yet to contact you and you immediately took it off and replaced it with a hoodie.</p><p>You shut your door and locked it and closed all your blinds leaving you in the dark with light peering through the cracks of the curtains. You opened your laptop and began to rewatch parks and rec in silence, wishing that someone, anyone would wish you happy birthday and take you out of your misery.</p><p>Still, nothing. </p><p>8:49 p.m </p><p>You had successfully finished a few seasons of parks and rec, completely forgetting that no one remembered your birthday and you had already worked out an argument that you couldn\u2019t lose for peter. He\u2019d come begging to you for forgiveness and you\u2019d tell him that if you were really important he wouldn\u2019t forget something like this and he would have to make amends. </p><p>You had dinner with your mom and shared a few laughs and ate some cupcakes. You didn\u2019t throw a party because you had planned to go to an arcade with your friends today, but everyone was busy. </p><p>10:32 p.m</p><p>You still had no notifications relating to your birthday. You cried some more while parks and rec played in the background, a single text tone shut you up. </p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: hey sorry if I\u2019m late but happy birthday :-)</i></p><p>You hated to admit it but flash was actually a good guy and his text brought a smile on your face. You two had always been friends but never spoke much, kind of like an unspoken friendship you could say. </p><p><i><b>You</b>: it\u2019s okay thank you it really means a lot</i></p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: what did penis Parker give you? I know he\u2019s been talking about it for ages</i></p><p><i><b>You</b>: nothing actually, you were the first to wish me a happy birthday, besides my mom</i></p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: oh god no, i have to fix this right now, I\u2019m going to you house and we are turning your birthday from sad to rad &gt;:) </i></p><p>In the matter of ten minutes he arrived with games, snacks and a gift bag. You warmly welcomed him and he said hi to your mom who was on her way out for ladies night, you both sat in the living room and played a few games, challenging him on wii sports and absolutely destroying him in Mario kart. You were having so much fun and you were glad that at least he had remembered. </p><p>\u201cOpen your gift\u201d he smiled at you handing your the bag and you took it from him. </p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s appropriate\u201d you joked and he only smiled. You took out a small notecard that read \u201cthe best thing about today is you!\u201d With a small dog balancing a cake on his nose. You giggled at the image and in Flash\u2019s handwriting was a small note. </p><p><i>Happy birthday Y/N you\u2019re an amazing person and i hope me being mean to Parker doesn\u2019t ruin our unspoken connection, yes i know speaking about technically means it\u2019s canon but just ignore that, i hope you have a great day and if you and Parker ever break up, you know I\u2019m here ;) </i></p><p>You smiled and laughed at his last sentence, you knew he was joking but the comment made you blush a little. You leaned over and hugged him. </p><p>\u201cthanks man, really\u201d you smiled and he urged you to look in the bag again. It was a framed picture of you, peter, ned, mj and flash all infront of some weird thing you had been forced to pose for. You mouth fell open and you couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on your face. </p><p>\u201cFlash i don\u2019t know what to say\u201d you looked at him and you didn\u2019t know how to react. </p><p>\u201cI do. Get the fuck out and leave her alone\u201d peter spoke from behind you. Your turned around stunned from hearing his voice so threatening and you furrowed your eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is your problem?\u201d You shoved him back quickly looking up at him and standing between him and flash. </p><p>\u201cMy problem? He\u2019s only trying to get with you, after all these years and you haven\u2019t noticed the crush he\u2019s been harboring?\u201d Peter scoffed and tried to walk closer to flash only for you to move directly i from of him and make him stop dead in his tracks. </p><p>\u201cWell at least his years of harboring this crush made him remember my birthday and a he gave me a thoughtful gift, compared to my so called \u2018boyfriend\u2019 who never even sent me a text!\u201d You raised your voice slightly and you knew peter was getting mad. </p><p>\u201c<i>So called</i>?!\u201d Peter was furious and you knew he would lose it soon, he rarely got angry but when he did get got <b><i>angry</i></b>.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go\u201d flash spoke from behind you to which you and peter both replied with a sharp \u201cno!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy did he even come to you house in the first place he doesn\u2019t belong here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho are <i>you</i> to say who belongs where!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnswer the fucking question Y/N\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was here because i asked him to come, because he was the only person to wish me happy birthday and he made an attempt to make me happy which is more than what you could say!\u201d </p><p>That was the final straw for peter, he was hurt and he was mad, he had a valid excuse for forgetting your birthday he really did. </p><p>He roughly moved you and threw flash out the front door and slammed it shut. </p><p>\u201cWhat the actual fuck Parker? You have the fucking nerve to come to my house and pull shit like that, you better start explaining now or so help me god\u201d you were shaking with rage and if you were honest you were ready to break up with him at this rate. </p><p>\u201cY/N I\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t wish you happy birthday but i didn\u2019t forget okay? I\u2019ve been really busy and i got caught up today and I\u2019ve been out since yesterday and i just got back and i tried to get to you as fast as possible\u201d he spoke quickly and fiddled with his fingers, messing with the promise ring you had given him a few months ago. </p><p>\u201cWhat the kind of bullshit excuse is this? May said you were in town!\u201d You glared at him and he groaned. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you this way baby, fuck it okay come on.\u201d He grabbed your hand and you looked at him in shock, he quickly helped you out the door and into the street. After walking in silence for a few minutes you reached an alley and he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cJust wait here and I\u2019ll be right back\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter What-\u201c he cut you off and quickly ran down the alley. Before you could yell at him you saw the famous Spider-Man come out of the same alley, he wrapped his arm around you and web shot from his wrist quickly swooping you off his feet and taking you swinging and before you knew it you were on top of a building over looking Queens. </p><p>You looked at him in awe, \u201cyou\u2019re Spider-Man?\u201d You couldn\u2019t wrap your head around it but it made so much sense. </p><p>He took his mask off and looked you in the eyes. </p><p>\u201cI was in some other state fighting off some bad guys with a few of the other avengers and i thought i would be back in time to surprise you but it got really bad and we ended up having stay two extra nights\u201d he spoke softly and slowly moved his hand to brush over yours. </p><p>\u201cso that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t text me at midnight?\u201d You whispered and suddenly realized how close together you were, and the way he looked in that suit was no helping you. </p><p>\u201cangel you know I\u2019d never forget something like that, you\u2019re my world and i kept this from you because i don\u2019t want the bad guys to know that you\u2019re my weakness. I told aunt May to say i was in town because i told her i didn\u2019t want you to know yet, i was too scared and look where that got us\u201d he whispered. </p><p>His forehead was against yours and you let out a shaky breath. </p><p>\u201cPeter Benjamin Parker i cant believe this but i forgive you\u201d you sighed and you saw his face light up, you quickly held up a finger to cut him off from saying anything. </p><p>\u201cBUT you do have a lot of emotional damage to clean up so you better get to work Spider-Man\u201d you winked at him and outlined the small spider on his chest with your index finger. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the death of me Y/N\u201d he spoke and leaned in quickly to kiss you, you wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled away from the kiss. </p><p>\u201cIf anything it\u2019s the other way around\u201d you teased and he frowned causing you to laugh. </p><p>\u201cHappy birthday baby, let me make up for my wrong doings yeah?\u201d He spoke kissing you once more and you smiled into the kiss. </p><p>\u201cshow me what you got Parker\u201d you smirked and he smiled. Maybe your birthday wasn\u2019t so bad after all. </p>",

You rushed to get water not wanting to miss the midnight texts that would come in from Ned, MJ and a few of your other friends. And especially peter. </p><p>11:59 p.m </p><p>You chugged your water down and sprinted to your room, quickly bouncing your leg up and down waiting for the clock to hit 12, you were smiling and you could feel your heart racing, excitement and adrenaline coursing through your veins. </p><p>12:00 a.m </p><p>You sat with a smile on your face, giddy to read the texts you were expecting. Your heart beat slowly returned to normal when your notification screen remained blank. The smiling picture of peter walking towards you with a bouquet of roses staring back at you. Maybe it\u2019s the connection. </p><p>12:01 a.m</p><p>Still nothing. You felt a familiar knot in your throat and you furrowed your eyebrows, getting under your blanket and turning the lights off, the light of your phone screen illuminating your room. Still nothing. </p><p>12:13 a.m</p><p>Not a single notification. Nothing. You didn\u2019t want to cry, not when your birthday had just begun, but being forgotten by everyone? By your best friends? By <i>peter</i>? Now that <b>hurt</b>. </p><p>You locked your phone and threw it somewhere on your bed, burrying your face in your pillow and letting the hot tears fall onto the soft fabric. You cried and cried until you felt your eyes getting puffier. In one last attempt to clean your recent wounds you checked your phone. </p><p>Nothing. </p><p>Locking it one last time you let yourself cry more and more until you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open any longer. </p><p>You woke up and the memories of the pervious night flooded back you felt your chest tighten. You checked your phone and you had no notifications. Getting out of bed you went to the restroom and went through your regular morning routine. When you reached the kitchen your mother smiled sweetly at you and handed you your favorite breakfast food. </p><p>You smiled gratefully at her and slowly picked at your food. </p><p>\u201cokay spill it what\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s your birthday!\u201d She cheered nudging you lightly with her elbow. </p><p>\u201cno one texted me or even said anything, i have no notifications\u201d you mumbled eating your food and sighing. </p><p>\u201cand peter?\u201d her voice dropped an octave and her protective instinctincs were kicking in. </p><p>You shook your head and you could tell she was angry. You quickly finished eating and washed your plate. You headed to your room and changed into some yoga pants and a t shirt and grabbed your headphones. </p><p>Heading for the door you told your mom you were gonna go for a walk and you shoved your headphones in your ears, blasting them in an attempt to try and forget that all your friends and your boyfriend forgot about your birthday. You sighed as tears began to prick your eyes and you quickly wiped stray tears away and continued to walk to a small park near your house. When you reached it you saw a few kids playing with their parents and a few dogs playing fetch with their owners. </p><p>You didn\u2019t know how many times you walked the trail in the park when your mom called you to get back home because you had been out for over three hours. You sighed and made your way back home, stopping to pat a few of the dogs that approached you. </p><p>When you got home you showered and changed into some shorts and one of peters shirts. You quickly remembered that he had yet to contact you and you immediately took it off and replaced it with a hoodie.</p><p>You shut your door and locked it and closed all your blinds leaving you in the dark with light peering through the cracks of the curtains. You opened your laptop and began to rewatch parks and rec in silence, wishing that someone, anyone would wish you happy birthday and take you out of your misery.</p><p>Still, nothing. </p><p>8:49 p.m </p><p>You had successfully finished a few seasons of parks and rec, completely forgetting that no one remembered your birthday and you had already worked out an argument that you couldn\u2019t lose for peter. He\u2019d come begging to you for forgiveness and you\u2019d tell him that if you were really important he wouldn\u2019t forget something like this and he would have to make amends. </p><p>You had dinner with your mom and shared a few laughs and ate some cupcakes. You didn\u2019t throw a party because you had planned to go to an arcade with your friends today, but everyone was busy. </p><p>10:32 p.m</p><p>You still had no notifications relating to your birthday. You cried some more while parks and rec played in the background, a single text tone shut you up. </p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: hey sorry if I\u2019m late but happy birthday :-)</i></p><p>You hated to admit it but flash was actually a good guy and his text brought a smile on your face. You two had always been friends but never spoke much, kind of like an unspoken friendship you could say. </p><p><i><b>You</b>: it\u2019s okay thank you it really means a lot</i></p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: what did penis Parker give you? I know he\u2019s been talking about it for ages</i></p><p><i><b>You</b>: nothing actually, you were the first to wish me a happy birthday, besides my mom</i></p><p><i><b>Flash</b>: oh god no, i have to fix this right now, I\u2019m going to you house and we are turning your birthday from sad to rad &gt;:) </i></p><p>In the matter of ten minutes he arrived with games, snacks and a gift bag. You warmly welcomed him and he said hi to your mom who was on her way out for ladies night, you both sat in the living room and played a few games, challenging him on wii sports and absolutely destroying him in Mario kart. You were having so much fun and you were glad that at least he had remembered. </p><p>\u201cOpen your gift\u201d he smiled at you handing your the bag and you took it from him. </p><p>\u201cPlease tell me it\u2019s appropriate\u201d you joked and he only smiled. You took out a small notecard that read \u201cthe best thing about today is you!\u201d With a small dog balancing a cake on his nose. You giggled at the image and in Flash\u2019s handwriting was a small note. </p><p><i>Happy birthday Y/N you\u2019re an amazing person and i hope me being mean to Parker doesn\u2019t ruin our unspoken connection, yes i know speaking about technically means it\u2019s canon but just ignore that, i hope you have a great day and if you and Parker ever break up, you know I\u2019m here ;) </i></p><p>You smiled and laughed at his last sentence, you knew he was joking but the comment made you blush a little. You leaned over and hugged him. </p><p>\u201cthanks man, really\u201d you smiled and he urged you to look in the bag again. It was a framed picture of you, peter, ned, mj and flash all infront of some weird thing you had been forced to pose for. You mouth fell open and you couldn\u2019t stop the smile from forming on your face. </p><p>\u201cFlash i don\u2019t know what to say\u201d you looked at him and you didn\u2019t know how to react. </p><p>\u201cI do. Get the fuck out and leave her alone\u201d peter spoke from behind you. Your turned around stunned from hearing his voice so threatening and you furrowed your eyebrows. </p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is your problem?\u201d You shoved him back quickly looking up at him and standing between him and flash. </p><p>\u201cMy problem? He\u2019s only trying to get with you, after all these years and you haven\u2019t noticed the crush he\u2019s been harboring?\u201d Peter scoffed and tried to walk closer to flash only for you to move directly i from of him and make him stop dead in his tracks. </p><p>\u201cWell at least his years of harboring this crush made him remember my birthday and a he gave me a thoughtful gift, compared to my so called \u2018boyfriend\u2019 who never even sent me a text!\u201d You raised your voice slightly and you knew peter was getting mad. </p><p>\u201c<i>So called</i>?!\u201d Peter was furious and you knew he would lose it soon, he rarely got angry but when he did get got <b><i>angry</i></b>.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go\u201d flash spoke from behind you to which you and peter both replied with a sharp \u201cno!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy did he even come to you house in the first place he doesn\u2019t belong here!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho are <i>you</i> to say who belongs where!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnswer the fucking question Y/N\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe was here because i asked him to come, because he was the only person to wish me happy birthday and he made an attempt to make me happy which is more than what you could say!\u201d </p><p>That was the final straw for peter, he was hurt and he was mad, he had a valid excuse for forgetting your birthday he really did. </p><p>He roughly moved you and threw flash out the front door and slammed it shut. </p><p>\u201cWhat the actual fuck Parker? You have the fucking nerve to come to my house and pull shit like that, you better start explaining now or so help me god\u201d you were shaking with rage and if you were honest you were ready to break up with him at this rate. </p><p>\u201cY/N I\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t wish you happy birthday but i didn\u2019t forget okay? I\u2019ve been really busy and i got caught up today and I\u2019ve been out since yesterday and i just got back and i tried to get to you as fast as possible\u201d he spoke quickly and fiddled with his fingers, messing with the promise ring you had given him a few months ago. </p><p>\u201cWhat the kind of bullshit excuse is this? May said you were in town!\u201d You glared at him and he groaned. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you this way baby, fuck it okay come on.\u201d He grabbed your hand and you looked at him in shock, he quickly helped you out the door and into the street.

He&rsquo;s only trying to get with you, after all these years and you haven&rsquo;t noticed the crush he&rsquo;s been harboring?&rdquo; Peter scoffed and tried to walk closer to flash only for you to move directly i from of him and make him stop dead in his tracks. </p><p>&ldquo;Well at least his years of harboring this crush made him remember my birthday and a he gave me a thoughtful gift, compared to my so called &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo; who never even sent me a text!&rdquo; You raised your voice slightly and you knew peter was getting mad. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>So called</i>?!&rdquo; Peter was furious and you knew he would lose it soon, he rarely got angry but when he did get got <b><i>angry</i></b>.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna go&rdquo; flash spoke from behind you to which you and peter both replied with a sharp &ldquo;no!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Why did he even come to you house in the first place he doesn&rsquo;t belong here!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Who are <i>you</i> to say who belongs where!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Answer the fucking question Y/N&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He was here because i asked him to come, because he was the only person to wish me happy birthday and he made an attempt to make me happy which is more than what you could say!&rdquo; </p><p>That was the final straw for peter, he was hurt and he was mad, he had a valid excuse for forgetting your birthday he really did. </p><p>He roughly moved you and threw flash out the front door and slammed it shut. </p><p>&ldquo;What the actual fuck Parker? You have the fucking nerve to come to my house and pull shit like that, you better start explaining now or so help me god&rdquo; you were shaking with rage and if you were honest you were ready to break up with him at this rate. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N I&rsquo;m sorry i didn&rsquo;t wish you happy birthday but i didn&rsquo;t forget okay? I&rsquo;ve been really busy and i got caught up today and I&rsquo;ve been out since yesterday and i just got back and i tried to get to you as fast as possible&rdquo; he spoke quickly and fiddled with his fingers, messing with the promise ring you had given him a few months ago. </p><p>&ldquo;What the kind of bullshit excuse is this? May said you were in town!&rdquo; You glared at him and he groaned. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you this way baby, fuck it okay come on.&rdquo; He grabbed your hand and you looked at him in shock, he quickly helped you out the door and into the street. After walking in silence for a few minutes you reached an alley and he finally spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Just wait here and I&rsquo;ll be right back&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter What-&ldquo; he cut you off and quickly ran down the alley. Before you could yell at him you saw the famous Spider-Man come out of the same alley, he wrapped his arm around you and web shot from his wrist quickly swooping you off his feet and taking you swinging and before you knew it you were on top of a building over looking Queens. </p><p>You looked at him in awe, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re Spider-Man?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t wrap your head around it but it made so much sense. </p><p>He took his mask off and looked you in the eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I was in some other state fighting off some bad guys with a few of the other avengers and i thought i would be back in time to surprise you but it got really bad and we ended up having stay two extra nights&rdquo; he spoke softly and slowly moved his hand to brush over yours. </p><p>&ldquo;so that&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t text me at midnight?&rdquo; You whispered and suddenly realized how close together you were, and the way he looked in that suit was no helping you. </p><p>&ldquo;angel you know I&rsquo;d never forget something like that, you&rsquo;re my world and i kept this from you because i don&rsquo;t want the bad guys to know that you&rsquo;re my weakness. I told aunt May to say i was in town because i told her i didn&rsquo;t want you to know yet, i was too scared and look where that got us&rdquo; he whispered. </p><p>His forehead was against yours and you let out a shaky breath. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter Benjamin Parker i cant believe this but i forgive you&rdquo; you sighed and you saw his face light up, you quickly held up a finger to cut him off from saying anything. </p><p>&ldquo;BUT you do have a lot of emotional damage to clean up so you better get to work Spider-Man&rdquo; you winked at him and outlined the small spider on his chest with your index finger. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the death of me Y/N&rdquo; he spoke and leaned in quickly to kiss you, you wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled away from the kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;If anything it&rsquo;s the other way around&rdquo; you teased and he frowned causing you to laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;Happy birthday baby, let me make up for my wrong doings yeah?&rdquo; He spoke kissing you once more and you smiled into the kiss. </p><p>&ldquo;show me what you got Parker&rdquo; you smirked and he smiled. Maybe your birthday wasn&rsquo;t so bad after all. </p>",

I\u2019m a disappointment and not good enough for your legacy. You made that crystal clear, congratulations. Truly Hallmark worthy.\u201d Tony snipes, his hand shaking as he clicks the phone shut. </p><p>His jaw can\u2019t unclench. He\u2019s so sick of this. He\u2019s so- he\u2019s so tired. He\u2019s exhausted from the back and forth and the constant circle their lives had become. His phone slides into his back pocket, he looks around. He doesn\u2019t- he doesn\u2019t even know where he <i>is</i>. He\u2019s somewhere off campus- obviously. He\u2019s sure his dorm is around here <i>somewhere</i>. But honestly, he really isn\u2019t all that inclined to look and he doesn\u2019t want to go back to his room and see Rhodey\u2019s empathetic eyes and he doesn\u2019t want to sit in the library and ruminate and he sure as hell doesn\u2019t want to be in the common room listening as everyone in the world enjoys their life more than he ever could. </p><p>So he walks. </p><p>And just\u2026keeps walking. </p><p>And what the hell? He\u2019s seventeen, in his third year (he could\u2019ve graduated by now but a secret, small, totally repressed part of him wanted to slide his tassel with Rhodey beside him), completely ignoring his plethora of assignments and therefore has nothing better to be doing than walking aimlessly in Cambridge on what technically is a nice autumn day. Yeah\u2026the trees are orange. A bit red. Some are yellow. There are some nice piles growing on the sidewalks, some birds flying south in an asymmetrical V. Yup. It\u2019s all so overly pleasantly pretty and just gosh darn it wonderful.</p><p>Tony fucking hates it.</p><p>He loves MIT and he loves Rhodey and he loves building every day in the workshop but God he hates his life. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t hate it. He\u2019s just so tired. <i>All the time</i>. And there\u2019s nothing new and there\u2019s nothing- nothing moving him forward he\u2019s just- he\u2019s stagnant. He\u2019s just still. Trapped. Caught. And he can\u2019t do it anymore he just can\u2019t. And maybe it\u2019s his dad- God it\u2019s always his dad- but he\u2019s sick of always being kicked by the same old shit and he\u2019s sick of doing everything his dad wants and and he\u2019s sick of doing what everyone <i>else</i> wants and yeah Tony Stark has never bowed down to anybody, but can he honestly say he chose any of this? This is <i>his life</i>- why the fuck isn\u2019t he happy? </p><p>Tony kicks a pebble. It stutters across the sidewalk then gets blown into the street, run over by a car. Tony blows a harsh breath. <i>Figures</i>. </p><!-- more --><p>Okay so fine. His life is just always the same, nothing ever changes, okay fine. Now he\u2019s here. At a\u2026at a- Tony looks up, quickly scans the street- okay at a bakery and a convenience store and a sketchy dim sum place, a homey shawarma joint, and a sketchier deli. Alright, cool, cool, cool. </p><p>Except, he\u2019s not hungry. Not even a little. </p><p>Feeling like shit does that to you. </p><p>Yeah. He probably is a disappointment. He can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at him like he was- Tony grimaces. He doesn\u2019t even want to think it. It\u2019s so\u2026well it\u2019s gross is what it is. But fuck it. He\u2019s already being a little bitch about everything, he might as well just admit that he wishes someone would like at him like he was something precious. Or wonderful. Or just\u2026enough. Being just enough would be great. </p><p>Fantastic even.</p><p>Rhodey does. Sometimes. But Rhodey knows him now better than any single person in Tony\u2019s entire life outside of Jarvis when he was alive. And because Rhodey knows him, he sees every one of his faults and wants better for him. Wants to help Tony grow. And that\u2019s great. That\u2019s dandy. That\u2019s just awesome. But it- well\u2026</p><p>Tony looks at Rhodey and sees the goddamn sun. </p><p>Rhodey is brilliant and he\u2019s throw your head back hilarious and he\u2019s witty and he\u2019s strong and he\u2019s <i>kind</i>. Tony doesn\u2019t even know if he has flaws. Maybe being too overprotective. Maybe too overbearing. But Tony craves that. Craves it so deeply. And so he looks at Rhodey and has to squint from how bright he shines and Tony wishes he could be as bright as just one bulb. Just that. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dream of being a star. </p><p>His feet wander without him really putting any thought into the matter and the air suddenly smells different. Fresher, wilder, lighter. He looks up and the sky is blocked by a canopy of thick foliage. Sunbeams peek through the gaps and the very leaves glitter. </p><p>He feels like he\u2019s in a fairy tale.</p><p>And Tony\u2019s never really liked nature. Was never into it. Never appreciated it. But in this exact moment, he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful and he doesn\u2019t know why it strikes him right down to his depths but it does and he just keeps staring. Something tugs in his chest and maybe it\u2019s longing. Maybe it\u2019s hurt. Maybe it\u2019s just a childhood wish he tried to lock deep, deep down and he forces it back under, looks back to the ground. </p><p>He keeps walking. </p><p>He can hear the sounds of kids yelling, laughter ringing in the wind, the little pitter patter of footsteps. He smells the hot-dog stand and the sound of dogs barking as owners threw frisbees and tennis balls. The sun is glowing, gentle, and Tony\u2019s skin feels warm. Loved. It\u2019s despicably idyllic except <i>those fucking kids are ruining it</i>. </p><p>There\u2019s a group of three boys, they look like they\u2019re snot-nosed tweens, thirteen at the max. Tony curls his lip. He hates middle schoolers. God couldn\u2019t put demons on Earth so he gave the world preteens instead. And these boys, these stupid, arrogant, obnoxious little twerps were harassing this shrimp of a kid with floppy brown hair and probably the most pathetic little lip wobble Tony had ever seen. </p><p>The kids are shoving the boy around, laughing as he tries to swallow his tears and push through them, but they hold out their arms and shove him back down. A few tears dribble past his lashes and the kid is red in the face trying to stop. \u201cAwww are you crying? Wow, what a baby. You stupid <i>baby</i>.\u201d The first boy jeers. </p><p>The second boy laughs and shoves the kid back down when he tries to get up and by this point, Tony has had <i>enough</i>. He\u2019s tired and angry and full of repressed emotional trauma and other bullshit that taking it out on a bunch of two-bit good for nothing bullies would <i>really</i> make his day. \u201cHey!\u201d he yells, storming over, chin tilted like he\u2019s looking for a fight. </p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d and when he swears, the kids freeze a little. \u201cYou have two seconds to back the fuck away before I show you who the real big dog at this playground is.\u201d </p><p>The boys stare and the first boy, probably their stupid ring leader, takes on a haughty expression, an air of false confidence about it. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell us what to do-\u201d he starts to say, before Tony pins him with a stare so dark he could have only learned it from his dad. </p><p>He grabs at the boy\u2019s shirt and tugs up so that he\u2019s barely brushing the ground with his toes. Tony might be smaller than all the other third-years, but he\u2019s spent twice as long in the workshops moving part after part and hammering piece after piece. He knows exactly how strong he can be when he tries, and lifting a hundred pound brat off the floor is nothing. Especially not when he\u2019s feeling like this. \u201cYou won\u2019t like me if I have to repeat myself.\u201d he says in a deceptively calm voice.</p><p>The boy gulps and Tony can see that fake bravado chip away. <i>Good</i>, he thinks. The boy slaps at his hands, glaring, \u201cOkay, okay let me go you freak. God.\u201d He rips away from Tony\u2019s grip, gesturing to his friends and they run off. </p><p>Tony watches as they go, \u201cYou pick on this kid or anyone else and you\u2019ll regret it, you hear me!\u201d if the boys hear him, they make no sound of it. </p><p>But Tony knows they did.</p><p>And that\u2019s enough. </p><p>The little boy is still on the ground when Tony turns around, staring up, not in fear anymore, but in a childish wide-eye that plummets him. Something strange takes over him, maybe he\u2019s channeling Jarvis. Trying to do his memory proud. But Tony bends down, gives him half a smile. \u201cHey kid, you good?\u201d</p><p>Shyly, the kid nods, looking up at him with wet, uncertain eyes. He\u2019s got some scratches on his knees and dirt on his arms and hands where he\u2019s been tossed into the ground. That couldn\u2019t be fun. Tony sighs, giving him a stern look. \u201cStay here okay? I\u2019m going to grab some stuff to clean you up.\u201d </p><p>The kid just stares at him but when Tony glances back, he\u2019s standing obediently still. Tony slides a fiver to the hotdog guy, grabs two bottles of water and a bunch of napkins and returns, offering them to the kid. Except he just stares blankly at him and Tony has to unscrew the bottles himself, sprinkling a bit onto the napkins. \u201cThis should get the dirt off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Oh yeah. Thank you\u2026\u201d he murmurs, taking the napkins and wiping steadily at his knees. </p><p>And okay, the kid\u2019s trying his best but he\u2019s really just\u2026ineffective. And Tony drops to the floor, gesturing for the kid to join him as he takes the remaining napkins himself, dabbing at his face and elbows. \u201cYou gotta scrub a little harder. Really work the grime off.\u201d Tony remarks, trying to ignore the kid\u2019s shy half stares. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026okay, I can do it now. I\u2019m not a baby anymore.\u201d he says authoritatively, holding out his hand.</p><p>Tony pauses, squinting his eyes and then glancing all around him as though suddenly remembering children shouldn\u2019t be unsupervised. \u201cAren\u2019t you like, five? Where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not five,\u201d he asserts, \u201cI\u2019m seven and a half.\u201d he says proudly. </p><p>Like Tony really knew the difference between a five and a seven year old. There\u2019s something warm in his placating stare though and the kid seems to pick up on it from how he perks up a little. \u201cOkay so you\u2019re seven. Incredible. Pretty sure you still need parents though.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugs, picking at the grass. \u201cI don\u2019t have parents. Uncle Ben said they died in a plane. So I live with him now. And Aunt May. But they have work so I\u2019m supposed to be with Carly. But she lost me.\u201d </p><p>Tony gapes. Not really knowing where to go from all that. Kids are just- so freaking weird. They have no real concept of anything. Don\u2019t know anything about social etiquette or TMI or like, needing to have at least a level four friendship to unlock each other\u2019s tragic backstories. </p><p>Tony lets his knees fall from under him, sitting properly across from the kid who\u2019s still plucking at the greenery like it had personally offended him. \u201cThis Carly, she your baby-sitter?\u201d </p><p>He looks up finally, giving him a sad look. \u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t think she likes me very much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s dumb.\u201d Tony says, like he was commenting on something obvious like the sun in their faces. </p><p>He\u2019s surprised.</p><p>At himself.</p><p>Which is\u2026also weird.</p><p>The kid looks surprised too. But cutely so. He ducks his head, shy. \u201cSo she lost you? She left you? By yourself??\u201d and Tony kinda hates this Carly chick, whoever the hell she is.</p><p>The kid\u2019s all bruised up and probably just went through his least traumatic, but still traumatic life experience, because she decided to what, gab with her stupid boyfriend or something? And the kid\u2019s looking all flustered and apologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t know! I stayed where she told me to stay but then she left to get something from the store and then she didn\u2019t come back but I moved a little so maybe it\u2019s my fault but then I got lost and then those boys found me and they were being mean to me and I didn\u2019t know what to do but then you saved me!\u201d and he looks so endeared, like what Tony did was something amazing, utterly incredible. </p><p>He looks like a goddamn chipmunk with absurdly cute cartoon eyes. Or something. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Tony mumbles but the kid shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cWhaaat? You were so cool! You were like hey! And then you said a bad word but it\u2019s okay because they were mean and sometimes Ben says bad words to bad guys too and then you were like go away! And they were like no! And then you got all scary but in a cool way and then they ran!\u201d And his hands are flying all over the place as he retells the moment and he looks so excited, so <i>involved,</i> that Tony almost believes he was as cool as the kid thinks.</p><p>\u201cWell they were being giant wastes of space, so.\u201d Tony shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that bad about it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks around again, at all the kids with their parents and looks back at the chipmunk. \u201cYou got a name kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Peter Benjamin Parker!\u201d he grins.</p><p>And Tony really doesn\u2019t know why he does it, but he sticks out his hand and says, \u201cI\u2019m Tony.\u201d </p><p>And Peter stares at his hand for a few seconds before reaching out to shake it, his hand so small in Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cWell lest I be accused of kidnapping, we should probably get you back with your baby sitter.\u201d </p><p>Peter deflates a little, letting out a little \u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>Tony ignores how cute that is. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you know her number or anything?\u201d</p><p>Peter stares blankly. \u201cHow about your aunt? Or your uncle?\u201d </p><p>Peter chews on his lip, thinking very intently, his nose all scrunched up. \u201cUmm I think\u2026there was definitely a five-four-five and umm\u2026maybe a two?\u201d his face falls, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Tony, I was supposed to memorize their numbers a long time ago but I keep forgetting them.\u201d he looks down, like he\u2019s expecting to be reprimanded but Tony just ruffles his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen and I couldn\u2019t tell you what the first number of either of my parents\u2019 numbers are. Don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d </p><p>But the fact remained, he still had a kid he needed to get home somehow without really all that much to go on. \u201cWhat about your aunt and uncle\u2019s work. What do they do?\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up and Tony sees the pride and admiration he has in his eyes so clearly it hurts. \u201cBen is so cool! He\u2019s a cop and he finds bad guys and he\u2019s like, a superhero.\u201d Peter says, very seriously, \u201cAnd May is a nurse! She saves people\u2019s <i>lives</i>.\u201d And he looks very intent. Very serious. </p><p>Tony smiles, \u201cWow. They sound like very important people.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods fiercely. \u201cVery very important.\u201d</p><p>So Tony weighs his options. Call the cops and then get arrested probably. Or try his luck with nearby hospitals. He clicks tongue. Well <i>that\u2019s</i> a no-brainer. \u201cDo you know which hospital your aunt works at Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm\u2026the mountain one!\u201d</p><p>The\u2026the <i>what</i>?? But then Tony thinks about it and he can\u2019t help but snort. Mount Sinai. Twenty minutes from here. He looks at Peter again, at that overly endearing, try hard face and resists the urge to ruffle his hair again. <i>The mountain one</i>. </p><p>Jeez, that\u2019s cute.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sit tight kid, I\u2019ll get you home.\u201d But he\u2019s looking so beat up and Tony kinda hates that he came to the park just to get bullied so he pulls out his wallet and hands him a twenty dollar bill. \u201cSee that ice cream cart over there? Go get yourself something while I call your aunt. You deserve it for helping me stick it to those assholes.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide at the money. \u201cReally?? I can get any kind??\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts, \u201cKnock yourself out kid. Just don\u2019t leave my sight. Can\u2019t have you lost twice in one day can we?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, extremely serious, and carefully folds the bill into his hand where it\u2019s clenched tightly. Tony googles the hospital number, waiting for the receptionist to pick up. \u201cHi can I speak to May Parker? It\u2019s about her nephew, Peter.\u201d </p><p>The receptionist, nice girl, manages to snag May from wherever she was pretty quickly. \u201cIs this May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, who is this?\u201d and she\u2019s not rude necessarily, but she\u2019s definitely bordering on I\u2019m gonna lose it unless I know exactly what\u2019s going on in ten seconds and Tony\u2019s kinda surprised she hired someone like Carly to look after her kid. </p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Tony Stark and I found your nephew Peter being bullied by some kids in the park. I got rid of the little idiots but when I tried to bring him back to his parents he said he was with his baby sitter, Carly? And that she had left him alone and he got lost. And he doesn\u2019t know her number but he knows where you work so\u2026\u201d </p><p>It sounds like she\u2019s hyperventilating on the other line. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god is he- is Peter <i>okay</i>? Jesus what the- what the fuck. She lost my kid? She <i>lost</i> <i>Peter</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Parker he\u2019s okay. Scout\u2019s honor. He\u2019s buying ice cream from the cart right now. I can keep you on the line if you want to talk to him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. I need to- yes. And thank you.\u201d she says suddenly, like she\u2019s just remembering something, \u201cFor calling me. I don\u2019t know what I would do if- if-\u201d she breaks off and Tony knows in that moment that May is a good guardian. That she loves Peter. Tremendously. Truly. Epically. </p><p>And he\u2019s grateful too suddenly. That he\u2019s the one who found him. </p><p>\u201cI can bring him to the hospital. If you want.\u201d he offers and it\u2019s so uncharacteristic of him but so was every other fucking thing so far, so why not this.</p><p>She pauses and Tony can tell she\u2019s conflicted over how far her trust of a stranger goes. \u201cMount Sinai, that\u2019s just a bus ride away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d she finally says. \u201cI really can\u2019t afford to leave my shift but I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in twenty minutes tops.\u201d </p><p>Peter is bounding over, holding two sealed popsicles in his hands, a wide smile on his face. \u201cHere\u2019s Peter now,\u201d he holds out the phone, \u201cHey kid, wanna talk to your aunt?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s expression falls, \u201cIs she mad?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cNot at you. She\u2019s worried about you though.\u201d And that triggers the kid\u2019s pure little heart and he trades the popsicles for the phone, holding it tight. </p><p>\u201cMay don\u2019t be worried. I\u2019m okay! Mr. Tony saved me!\u201d </p><p>And shit, Tony wants to just- he doesn\u2019t even know- melt or something??<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know where she went. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to lose her.\u201d But May must have set him straight on whose fault it all really was because Peter looks cowed, pulling absently at his curls. \u201cOkay. Yes. Mr. Tony\u2019s taking me? Okay. Okay, bye May. See you soon. Love you lots too.\u201d </p><p>He says it with so much ease. Like saying and hearing I love you\u2019s was just as normal as breathing. Tony thinks it\u2019s probably just as necessary. We just never knew we were suffocating until it was too late. </p><p>Kids are weird. He knows that. But kids are also\u2026well they\u2019re better than us aren\u2019t they? In a lot of ways. Better at expression and kindness and a genuine open-heartedness that the world hasn\u2019t stifled yet. Peter turns to him, holds out his phone. \u201cTrada ya.\u201d he says, with a toothy grin and Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he was that unabashedly joyful.</p><p>Tony passes over both popsicles and Peter frowns. \u201cThat one\u2019s for you!\u201d he says insistently, pushing one of the popsicles back.</p><p>Tony\u2019s surprised, just kinda staring. \u201cEating ice cream\u2019s no fun alone. But I didn\u2019t know if you liked chocolate or vanilla so I just bought us strawberry popsicles because everyone loves popsicles.\u201d he says matter of factly. </p><p>\u201cOpen it, open it!\u201d Peter chants and Tony peels back the plastic to reveal an artificially pink icy mess that is somehow the most appealing dessert he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cAre we going to go to May\u2019s now?\u201d Peter asks, lips stained pink already. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah. Yeah, let\u2019s go kid. We can still catch the ten.\u201d And like it\u2019s just habit, Peter holds up his hand, not even looking at him, and Tony feels something inexplicable inside him. </p><p>It hits him in that moment, that he\u2019s never held a baby. Seventeen years old and he\u2019s never cradled a newborn. Or smelled that weird newborn smell everyone raved about. He\u2019s never piggy-backed a toddler or lifted them high in the air. He\u2019s never chased a four year old around the kitchen as they shrieked. He\u2019s never walked a child down the street. </p><p>But Peter holds up his hand like he\u2019s absolutely confident that Tony is the responsible kind of adult that will look both ways and make sure the walk sign flashes. He holds up his hand like Tony is a grown up, someone to rely on. Like Tony is someone he can trust. </p><p>And it\u2019s silly. It really isn\u2019t that deep. But on a level Peter doesn\u2019t even acknowledge yet, he believes in Tony and believes he will get him to where he needs to go and <i>of cour</i>se Tony will be able to accomplish this task because he is an <i>adult</i> and he <i>saved </i>him from bullies so <i>of course</i> Tony can do anything. He doesn\u2019t know about all the failures and his father and his mountain of regrets. </p><p>It\u2019s the most refreshing thing Tony\u2019s ever felt. </p><p>He takes Peter\u2019s hand and Peter swings it casually as they walk. And Tony licks his popsicle and feels ridiculously domestic. And weird. And it\u2019s such an out of body experience, he doesn\u2019t even believe it\u2019s him. That it\u2019s his life he\u2019s living right now. </p><p>The bus is rickety and old like everything else in the city, but Peter seems perfectly content just staring out the window. He finishes the last of his popsicle, staring sadly at the stick before sighing melodramatically. He holds out his hand, staring pointedly at Tony\u2019s own. Unsure where this was all going, Tony hands it to him and watches as he maneuvers the delicate balancing game of walking down the aisle, throwing the sticks into the trashcan. Whatever May and Ben Parker did to raise that kid, it was all right. </p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job too?\u201d Peter asks randomly, tearing his eyes away from a particularly bright billboard to stare at Tony. </p><p>\u201cNah. I go to school here. MIT.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cOOHHHH that\u2019s so cool! I wanna go to MIT too!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirk up, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah! I wanna build super cool robots that can like, do all my chores for me because sometimes I wanna help May but I also wanna play with my Lego and I get so distracted that I keep playing and then May gets disappointed at me and that makes me sad.\u201d </p><p>He looks glum for all of two seconds before his giddiness bursts through again, \u201cBut! If I make a robot, then it can do all our chores and then we can all play Lego together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a pretty solid plan squirt. You definitely belong at MIT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you built robots?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuper cool ones.\u201d Tony confirms.</p><p>If possible, Peter\u2019s eyes go wider and Tony <i>swears</i> he sees stars in there. And it strikes him, in that very second, that Peter makes him feel like he\u2019s just the coolest person on the planet. Like he\u2019s valuable beyond compare, wise beyond his years, limitless and undefeatable. And it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s just so different. So fundamentally, utterly different than every other way he\u2019s been looked at before in his whole life and in a sickening turn of events he feels something close to insanely emotional bubble up inside him.</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing in his seat, gripping Tony\u2019s sleeve. \u201cLike what! Like what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you, if you want.\u201d Tony pulls out his phone, scrolling through until he finds what he needs. </p><p>It\u2019s a test video, of DUM-E being operational for the first time. In his entire life, it\u2019s probably the first moment Tony ever felt truly proud of something. Something he did entirely on his own for his own reasons and something that turned out fucking wonderful no matter what anyone else said. </p><p>Peter is in awe the whole time, his fingers clutching Tony\u2019s shirt tighter. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d he breathes, \u201cWow. WOOWWW. You\u2019re like, a real robot scientist! An umm- umm inventor! Yeah! Like Belle\u2019s dad.\u201d he glances up, \u201cYou know, like in Beauty and the Beast?\u201d and Tony just nods weakly, trying not to laugh, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool Mr. Tony! When I grow up, I wanna be like you!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes widen, caught off guard. He coughs, sliding to the next video to distract Peter from his early mid-life crisis but in a good way? He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with him right now. He\u2019s just- he\u2019s just overwhelmed. No one\u2019s\u2026no one\u2019s ever said that before. No one\u2019s ever even implied he could be worth aspiring to. </p><p>His father\u2019s words echo in his head and Tony can\u2019t help but feel a huge surge of <i>fuck you </i>because what did he know? What did Howard know about anything? When had he inspired anyone to do anything except out of fear. Useless, disappointing, never amounting to anything. What did those words mean, in the face of this shameless admiration from a kid who just saw a robot and thought wow that\u2019s cool, let alone having any awareness of the breakthrough that it was and the complexity of everything right down to the name. </p><p>Yeah. DUM-E is cool. Super fucking cool. And he is <i>Tony\u2019s </i>and Tony has a million and one more ideas and he is a goddamn <i>inventor</i>. </p><p>The mechanical voice announces their stop and Tony pulls the yellow string. \u201cThis is us kid. Maybe I\u2019ll show you the rest later.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks disappointed, but hands back Tony\u2019s phone quickly enough, standing close next to him as they wait at the back doors. It\u2019s kinda cute, the kid pressing himself against his leg to avoid all the strangers clustered around them. The doors finally open and Tony keeps a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder as they exit with the rush. He\u2019s pretty confident he knows the way to the hospital from here and the two of them walk in companiable silence broken only by Peter\u2019s commentary about the passing shops and restaurants.</p><p>\u201cAnd that one over there sells the best hot chocolate in the whole city!\u201d Peter declares, pointing energetically at a little hole in the wall.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he had hot chocolate. Or anything that wasn\u2019t just a straight up coffee for that matter. But he smiles, looking deep in thought. \u201cWow. The best huh? That\u2019s a pretty big prize, you sure you did your research.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, looking extremely certain. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. They give you whipped cream without making you pay extra and they put exactly four mini marshmallows and that\u2019s the perfect amount.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Tony says, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Peter copies, looking delighted at the word. </p><p>When Tony enters the hospital, there\u2019s a beautiful woman, mid-thirties probably, with long brown hair and a cute upturned nose pacing in circles in the lobby. \u201cMay!\u201d Peter cries, throwing himself in her direction.</p><p>The woman- May, Tony supposes- turns around, face lighting up in pure relief as she crouches down to squeeze him against her chest. \u201cPeter!\u201d she cries, face buried in his hair.</p><p>Tony stands behind awkwardly, fingers running through his hair in the absence of anything better to do. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d May says, pulling away to inspect him closely. </p><p>Satisfied that he was alright, she looks up, locks eyes with Tony and just scrutinizes him for what feels like a very long fifteen seconds. She stands, Peter trailing after her as she takes Tony\u2019s hand and squeezes. \u201cThank you. For finding him.\u201d Her sincerity makes something choke inside him. </p><p>But Tony is nothing if not great at brushing past feelings that threatened to hold him back and he stretches his lips into a lazy half-smile. \u201cNo need to thank me. Taking down jerks with big egos is a hobby of mine.\u201d </p><p>May quirks a lip before scowling. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe Carly would do that. Of all the stupidly irresponsible things. Anything could have happened if you hadn\u2019t been there. Or worse- if someone else had-\u201d she stops, looks down at Peter and just brushing her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019d recommend getting a new one.\u201d Tony says and May\u2019s expression falls.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long it took me to find <i>this</i> one. You\u2019d think in a city crawling with college kids it\u2019d be easier to find someone but <i>nooo</i>.\u201d she sighs, gives him a tired smile, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to.\u201d she jokes. </p><p>Peter practically explodes. He grabs onto May\u2019s leg, jumping so fasts Tony\u2019s sure he\u2019s going to give himself vertigo, \u201cMay <i>please</i>!!! Mr. Tony\u2019s so cool! He builds robots! He showed me on the bus and he just <i>talks </i>to it and then it <i>moves</i>. Isn\u2019t that so cool!!\u201d </p><p>May stumbles from his weight on her leg, laughing slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool Peter, but I don\u2019t think Tony can do that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually-\u201d Tony cuts off, actually <i>what?</i></p><p>But Peter\u2019s looking at him with those wide excited eyes and Tony feels <i>adored</i> for the first time in his life. Like he was some kind of superhero or something. And he thinks back to his dad and every single syllable that tore right through him and buried themselves in his heart so all the red turned black and bitter. And he thinks about how happy he was, in a weird, tired sort of way, bringing the kid all the way here. And how cool it would be to teach a kid something and then watch them grow with it and use it and change it and make it better. How incredible it is to watch someone grow. </p><p>And he said hadn\u2019t he? That he was craving something different. </p><p>\u201cI could\u2026I\u2019ve never baby-sat before. And I know you just met me. But I can get you references and a criminal record check. And I can tutor him- I study engineering at MIT. I can even bring him in to see the labs, maybe he can mess around a bit in there too.\u201d </p><p>Peter gasps so hard his hands fly to his mouth. </p><p>May takes a look at Peter, then back at Tony. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s a really nice offer. But I don\u2019t know you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could get to know me.\u201d Tony offers, shrugging in that shy way he did in the few times he was ever actually uncomfortable. </p><p>May peers into his eyes like she\u2019s trying to read his soul and slowly, a smile blooms. \u201cAlright Tony. Let\u2019s go get to know you.\u201d </p><p>Trying not to look taken aback, he follows her as she starts walking, \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. There\u2019s something about you\u2026\u201d she smiles, \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything for sure yet, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>One Month Later</p><p>Tony pulls up at the Kiss and Ride in a shiny convertible, sunglasses reflecting the light as he ignores all the staring moms. The bell rings and a rush of students storm out the doors, ushered by concerned teachers and supervisors. Peter comes bursting through, smiling wide when he sees him. \u201cTony!\u201d he yells, throwing open the car door. </p><p>\u201cEasy there squirt, you\u2019re gonna blow a gasket.\u201d Tony laughs, watching to make sure Peter clicked his seat belt in properly.</p><p>\u201cSunglasses please!\u201d Peter sings and Tony hands him a second matching pair that he eagerly slips on. </p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Tony asks, already shifting gears.</p><p>\u201cTime to fly!\u201d</p><p>Tony parks at the Parker\u2019s guest lot, using the house key in Peter\u2019s backpack to let themselves in. Peter throws his bag on the floor, running into his bedroom before Tony holds up a hand. \u201cCease and desist.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s socks skid as he stops. \u201cHomework first.\u201d </p><p>Peter turns around, pout forming, mouth open to whine before Tony beats him to it. \u201cHomework and then we can work on the thing.\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up, \u201cYou promise? Because you said that last time but then you spent all our time trying to make dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I <i>provided</i>. I was being a <i>provider</i>.\u201d Tony retorts, offended.</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve just bought pizza!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne day you\u2019re going to understand what the true college experience is and be just as sick of pizza as I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never growing up!\u201d Peter yells, zooming into his bedroom to get his notebook.</p><p>\u201cI regret showing you Peter Pan.\u201d </p><p>But Tony smiles anyway, setting up the kitchen table with the stuff in Peter\u2019s schoolbag. For the most part, Peter never really needed any help. And it was never even a lot, which made sense considering he was only in the second grade, but still. Routines were good for kids. Apparently. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019d been told anyway. </p><p>Peter makes a dent on some worksheets while Tony whirls through his coding assignment. They work in a nice quiet, interrupted only by Peter closing his duo-tang up and pushing back his chair so he could peer behind Tony\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, \u201cIt\u2019s so colourful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s code. It\u2019s like instructions to make a computer do stuff.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth forms an oh as he tries to take in everything that\u2019s happening. \u201cSo what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell me, nothing. The assignment is to find the flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Peter wrinkles his nose. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it kid.\u201d And Tony pushes his laptop shut before whirling around and grabbing Peter from his perch, spinning him around.</p><p>Peter shrieks with laughter as Tony dances him across to the living room before tossing him on the couch. \u201cAgain! Again! Again!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry Pete, I\u2019m too tired, too old\u2026\u201d Tony says regretfully, dramatically frowning with a woe is me hand placed ever so carefully over his forehead. </p><p>Peter looks crestfallen, looking like he\u2019s about to give in when Tony dives for him again, spinning him around and then launching him onto the cushions. Peter screams, raising his arms to go again. Tony throws him onto the couch until he literally can\u2019t move his arms anymore and he collapses next to Peter. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t be tired yet. We have to do the thing!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre all children tyrants, or is it just you?\u201d Tony teases, pinching Peter\u2019s cheek as he puffs them up. </p><p>Peter pushes against Tony\u2019s shoulder, but he\u2019s so light it hardly makes a difference. \u201cTonyyyy, Tony, Tony, To-nyyyy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeeeter, Peter, Petey-pie, Peter Pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter grins, plopping one little hand atop of Tony\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins from behind Peter\u2019s fingers. \u201cMmm smmsm mm.\u201d he dramatically mumbles and Peter pulls his hand away laughing. </p><p>\u201cOk fine. Grab my phone, put the playlist on, let\u2019s do this.\u201d </p><p>Peter cheers, high-tailing it off the couch to race to the table, plucking Tony\u2019s phone deftly while Tony went into the closet to pull out their project. As the child appropriate rock music burst in the apartment, Peter beams as Tony unveils the Death Star Lego set. It\u2019s five hundred pieces, way more than Peter could ever do on his own, but still less than the one thousand one he saw and Peter had never been more excited to do anything ever in his <i>life</i>. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he struggled with picturing all the tiny pieces coalescing into one whole. Enter Tony. He carefully takes out their well organized pieces in their little plastic bags from the box and sets out their base. \u201cOkay padawan, shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>Peter claps his hands. </p><p>Tony guides Peter through the process, never quite doing it himself, and always giving Peter the opportunity to try his own strategy first. Tony thought it would be tedious, when May first suggested he help the kid out, but there was something so ridiculously gratifying when the light shone in Peter\u2019s eyes when he clicked the right pieces together and the excitement that grew the higher up they built. Tony imagines what his life would have been like if his father had been the one to teach him these things, teach him what he knew about mechanics and innovation and engineering instead of Tony figuring it out all on his own. </p><p>Peter sticks out his tongue when he works, scrutinizing the pieces in his hands. He has to catch himself from looking too fond as he stares. Howard couldn\u2019t have loved him, Tony thinks, if he had willingly missed out on this feeling. To watch a child navigate the world and triumph in their little parts of it is humbling in a way. Made Tony feel smaller. Like the world had shrunk and his problems with it. </p><p>At first, he had no idea what to expect when May had called him asking him to come on as a baby-sitter. He thought it would be tiring and fun and something to piss off his dad with. Except that, from the second he walked into the apartment, he got swept up in a life far away from his own and everything seemed unimportant here. He wasn\u2019t worried about kicking Stanford\u2019s ass at the robotics competition, or the midterms he had coming up, or the way Howard talked to him. Kids are demanding. They have needs and wants and can only ever accomplish 40% of them without an adult and Tony finds himself swept away, part of Peter\u2019s world. </p><p>And he likes it there.</p><p>Tony gets up, ruffles Peter\u2019s hair as he goes. Peter grins up goofily at him, humming to himself as he turns back to his toy. Tony heads into the kitchen, boils some water, sets out two mugs. He mixes in a generous spoonful of Rolo Hot Chocolate Mix, adds exactly four marshmallows and swirls some whipped cream on top. </p><p>\u201cDrink break?\u201d Tony asks as Peter cheers.</p><p>They sit on the floor together, leaning against the couch as they take small sips from their cups. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found me in the park.\u201d Peter randomly says, a little whipped cream mustache on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou got a little something on your face bud,\u201d Tony points at his mouth and Peter struggles to lick everything off, \u201cBut yeah I guess I\u2019m sorta happy with how it all turned out.\u201d He teases.</p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>.\u201d Peter tries to glare but it comes out all wrong and it\u2019s so adorable Tony kinda wants to smack himself, \u201cMay says if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say then you shouldn\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise woman.\u201d Tony agrees.</p><p>\u201cWell I actually have something nice to say. Do you wanna hear it?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns to him, giving him his full, unadulterated attention, batting his eyes comically. Peter\u2019s lip quirks up. \u201cOh wait. I made something to say with this. Wait here Tony!\u201d he commands as though Tony could really go anywhere else.</p><p>Peter slams his room door shut and Tony can hear him fiddling around before he pokes his head out, \u201cClose your eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose my <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes!!\u201d he gestures emphatically at his own and Tony gives him a skeptical look but relents. </p><p>He hears Peter get closer, trying to mask an excited giggle. \u201cOkay, you can open your eyes now.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes open and his heart hiccups. Peter\u2019s giving him the biggest, cheesiest grin as he thrusts out a sloppily painted mug. It\u2019s white, except Peter\u2019s painted it all red in mismatched lines and in gold slanted writing, World\u2019s Funnest Baby-Sitter. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart bursts and he just knows that there is nothing he wouldn\u2019t ever do for Peter. </p><p>Tony would take a bullet for him. </p><p>He would beat the shit out of a million bullies for him.</p><p>He\u2019d build him a <i>real</i> Death Star if that would make him happy. </p><p>He takes the cup and hopes his hands don\u2019t tremble. He\u2019s never felt an endearment like this. He\u2019s never had an adoration this sweet and untainted by him. He grips it tight, examines it all over. \u201cYou\u2019re an artist <i>and</i> inventor? That\u2019s just not fair.\u201d </p><p>Peter clasps his hands behind his back. \u201cD\u2019you like it? May helped me make it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna drink from it every day.\u201d Tony promises.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes glitter. \u201cEven in the lab??\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> in the lab.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool!!\u201d </p><p>And then Peter falls into his chest, arms looping around his neck. And Tony just stares wide-eyed before slowly, his arms wrap around him too. He hugs Peter tightly. Closes his eyes. In Peter\u2019s world, Tony is necessary and needed and capable. In Peter\u2019s world he is admired and loved and inspiring in a way Tony never thought possible. He is Tony Stark, kid genius, engineering prodigy, inheritor of the Stark legacy. But kids are weird. And taking care of kids is weirder. Because the title he likes best is cupped tightly in his hands and the person he most likes being is who he is, right here, holding the world. \u00a0</p>",

Tony blows a harsh breath. <i>Figures</i>. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Okay so fine. His life is just always the same, nothing ever changes, okay fine. Now he\u2019s here. At a\u2026at a- Tony looks up, quickly scans the street- okay at a bakery and a convenience store and a sketchy dim sum place, a homey shawarma joint, and a sketchier deli. Alright, cool, cool, cool. </p><p>Except, he\u2019s not hungry. Not even a little. </p><p>Feeling like shit does that to you. </p><p>Yeah. He probably is a disappointment. He can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at him like he was- Tony grimaces. He doesn\u2019t even want to think it. It\u2019s so\u2026well it\u2019s gross is what it is. But fuck it. He\u2019s already being a little bitch about everything, he might as well just admit that he wishes someone would like at him like he was something precious. Or wonderful. Or just\u2026enough. Being just enough would be great. </p><p>Fantastic even.</p><p>Rhodey does. Sometimes. But Rhodey knows him now better than any single person in Tony\u2019s entire life outside of Jarvis when he was alive. And because Rhodey knows him, he sees every one of his faults and wants better for him. Wants to help Tony grow. And that\u2019s great. That\u2019s dandy. That\u2019s just awesome. But it- well\u2026</p><p>Tony looks at Rhodey and sees the goddamn sun. </p><p>Rhodey is brilliant and he\u2019s throw your head back hilarious and he\u2019s witty and he\u2019s strong and he\u2019s <i>kind</i>. Tony doesn\u2019t even know if he has flaws. Maybe being too overprotective. Maybe too overbearing. But Tony craves that. Craves it so deeply. And so he looks at Rhodey and has to squint from how bright he shines and Tony wishes he could be as bright as just one bulb. Just that. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dream of being a star. </p><p>His feet wander without him really putting any thought into the matter and the air suddenly smells different. Fresher, wilder, lighter. He looks up and the sky is blocked by a canopy of thick foliage. Sunbeams peek through the gaps and the very leaves glitter. </p><p>He feels like he\u2019s in a fairy tale.</p><p>And Tony\u2019s never really liked nature. Was never into it. Never appreciated it. But in this exact moment, he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful and he doesn\u2019t know why it strikes him right down to his depths but it does and he just keeps staring. Something tugs in his chest and maybe it\u2019s longing. Maybe it\u2019s hurt. Maybe it\u2019s just a childhood wish he tried to lock deep, deep down and he forces it back under, looks back to the ground. </p><p>He keeps walking. </p><p>He can hear the sounds of kids yelling, laughter ringing in the wind, the little pitter patter of footsteps. He smells the hot-dog stand and the sound of dogs barking as owners threw frisbees and tennis balls. The sun is glowing, gentle, and Tony\u2019s skin feels warm. Loved. It\u2019s despicably idyllic except <i>those fucking kids are ruining it</i>. </p><p>There\u2019s a group of three boys, they look like they\u2019re snot-nosed tweens, thirteen at the max. Tony curls his lip. He hates middle schoolers. God couldn\u2019t put demons on Earth so he gave the world preteens instead. And these boys, these stupid, arrogant, obnoxious little twerps were harassing this shrimp of a kid with floppy brown hair and probably the most pathetic little lip wobble Tony had ever seen. </p><p>The kids are shoving the boy around, laughing as he tries to swallow his tears and push through them, but they hold out their arms and shove him back down. A few tears dribble past his lashes and the kid is red in the face trying to stop. \u201cAwww are you crying? Wow, what a baby. You stupid <i>baby</i>.\u201d The first boy jeers. </p><p>The second boy laughs and shoves the kid back down when he tries to get up and by this point, Tony has had <i>enough</i>. He\u2019s tired and angry and full of repressed emotional trauma and other bullshit that taking it out on a bunch of two-bit good for nothing bullies would <i>really</i> make his day. \u201cHey!\u201d he yells, storming over, chin tilted like he\u2019s looking for a fight. </p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d and when he swears, the kids freeze a little. \u201cYou have two seconds to back the fuck away before I show you who the real big dog at this playground is.\u201d </p><p>The boys stare and the first boy, probably their stupid ring leader, takes on a haughty expression, an air of false confidence about it. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell us what to do-\u201d he starts to say, before Tony pins him with a stare so dark he could have only learned it from his dad. </p><p>He grabs at the boy\u2019s shirt and tugs up so that he\u2019s barely brushing the ground with his toes. Tony might be smaller than all the other third-years, but he\u2019s spent twice as long in the workshops moving part after part and hammering piece after piece. He knows exactly how strong he can be when he tries, and lifting a hundred pound brat off the floor is nothing. Especially not when he\u2019s feeling like this. \u201cYou won\u2019t like me if I have to repeat myself.\u201d he says in a deceptively calm voice.</p><p>The boy gulps and Tony can see that fake bravado chip away. <i>Good</i>, he thinks. The boy slaps at his hands, glaring, \u201cOkay, okay let me go you freak. God.\u201d He rips away from Tony\u2019s grip, gesturing to his friends and they run off. </p><p>Tony watches as they go, \u201cYou pick on this kid or anyone else and you\u2019ll regret it, you hear me!\u201d if the boys hear him, they make no sound of it. </p><p>But Tony knows they did.</p><p>And that\u2019s enough. </p><p>The little boy is still on the ground when Tony turns around, staring up, not in fear anymore, but in a childish wide-eye that plummets him. Something strange takes over him, maybe he\u2019s channeling Jarvis. Trying to do his memory proud. But Tony bends down, gives him half a smile. \u201cHey kid, you good?\u201d</p><p>Shyly, the kid nods, looking up at him with wet, uncertain eyes. He\u2019s got some scratches on his knees and dirt on his arms and hands where he\u2019s been tossed into the ground. That couldn\u2019t be fun. Tony sighs, giving him a stern look. \u201cStay here okay? I\u2019m going to grab some stuff to clean you up.\u201d </p><p>The kid just stares at him but when Tony glances back, he\u2019s standing obediently still. Tony slides a fiver to the hotdog guy, grabs two bottles of water and a bunch of napkins and returns, offering them to the kid. Except he just stares blankly at him and Tony has to unscrew the bottles himself, sprinkling a bit onto the napkins. \u201cThis should get the dirt off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Oh yeah. Thank you\u2026\u201d he murmurs, taking the napkins and wiping steadily at his knees. </p><p>And okay, the kid\u2019s trying his best but he\u2019s really just\u2026ineffective. And Tony drops to the floor, gesturing for the kid to join him as he takes the remaining napkins himself, dabbing at his face and elbows. \u201cYou gotta scrub a little harder. Really work the grime off.\u201d Tony remarks, trying to ignore the kid\u2019s shy half stares. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026okay, I can do it now. I\u2019m not a baby anymore.\u201d he says authoritatively, holding out his hand.</p><p>Tony pauses, squinting his eyes and then glancing all around him as though suddenly remembering children shouldn\u2019t be unsupervised. \u201cAren\u2019t you like, five? Where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not five,\u201d he asserts, \u201cI\u2019m seven and a half.\u201d he says proudly. </p><p>Like Tony really knew the difference between a five and a seven year old. There\u2019s something warm in his placating stare though and the kid seems to pick up on it from how he perks up a little. \u201cOkay so you\u2019re seven. Incredible. Pretty sure you still need parents though.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugs, picking at the grass. \u201cI don\u2019t have parents. Uncle Ben said they died in a plane. So I live with him now. And Aunt May. But they have work so I\u2019m supposed to be with Carly. But she lost me.\u201d </p><p>Tony gapes. Not really knowing where to go from all that. Kids are just- so freaking weird. They have no real concept of anything. Don\u2019t know anything about social etiquette or TMI or like, needing to have at least a level four friendship to unlock each other\u2019s tragic backstories. </p><p>Tony lets his knees fall from under him, sitting properly across from the kid who\u2019s still plucking at the greenery like it had personally offended him. \u201cThis Carly, she your baby-sitter?\u201d </p><p>He looks up finally, giving him a sad look. \u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t think she likes me very much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s dumb.\u201d Tony says, like he was commenting on something obvious like the sun in their faces. </p><p>He\u2019s surprised.</p><p>At himself.</p><p>Which is\u2026also weird.</p><p>The kid looks surprised too. But cutely so. He ducks his head, shy. \u201cSo she lost you? She left you? By yourself??\u201d and Tony kinda hates this Carly chick, whoever the hell she is.</p><p>The kid\u2019s all bruised up and probably just went through his least traumatic, but still traumatic life experience, because she decided to what, gab with her stupid boyfriend or something? And the kid\u2019s looking all flustered and apologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t know! I stayed where she told me to stay but then she left to get something from the store and then she didn\u2019t come back but I moved a little so maybe it\u2019s my fault but then I got lost and then those boys found me and they were being mean to me and I didn\u2019t know what to do but then you saved me!\u201d and he looks so endeared, like what Tony did was something amazing, utterly incredible. </p><p>He looks like a goddamn chipmunk with absurdly cute cartoon eyes. Or something. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Tony mumbles but the kid shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cWhaaat? You were so cool! You were like hey! And then you said a bad word but it\u2019s okay because they were mean and sometimes Ben says bad words to bad guys too and then you were like go away! And they were like no! And then you got all scary but in a cool way and then they ran!\u201d And his hands are flying all over the place as he retells the moment and he looks so excited, so <i>involved,</i> that Tony almost believes he was as cool as the kid thinks.</p><p>\u201cWell they were being giant wastes of space, so.\u201d Tony shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that bad about it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks around again, at all the kids with their parents and looks back at the chipmunk. \u201cYou got a name kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Peter Benjamin Parker!\u201d he grins.</p><p>And Tony really doesn\u2019t know why he does it, but he sticks out his hand and says, \u201cI\u2019m Tony.\u201d </p><p>And Peter stares at his hand for a few seconds before reaching out to shake it, his hand so small in Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cWell lest I be accused of kidnapping, we should probably get you back with your baby sitter.\u201d </p><p>Peter deflates a little, letting out a little \u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>Tony ignores how cute that is. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you know her number or anything?\u201d</p><p>Peter stares blankly. \u201cHow about your aunt? Or your uncle?\u201d </p><p>Peter chews on his lip, thinking very intently, his nose all scrunched up. \u201cUmm I think\u2026there was definitely a five-four-five and umm\u2026maybe a two?\u201d his face falls, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Tony, I was supposed to memorize their numbers a long time ago but I keep forgetting them.\u201d he looks down, like he\u2019s expecting to be reprimanded but Tony just ruffles his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen and I couldn\u2019t tell you what the first number of either of my parents\u2019 numbers are. Don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d </p><p>But the fact remained, he still had a kid he needed to get home somehow without really all that much to go on. \u201cWhat about your aunt and uncle\u2019s work. What do they do?\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up and Tony sees the pride and admiration he has in his eyes so clearly it hurts. \u201cBen is so cool! He\u2019s a cop and he finds bad guys and he\u2019s like, a superhero.\u201d Peter says, very seriously, \u201cAnd May is a nurse! She saves people\u2019s <i>lives</i>.\u201d And he looks very intent. Very serious. </p><p>Tony smiles, \u201cWow. They sound like very important people.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods fiercely. \u201cVery very important.\u201d</p><p>So Tony weighs his options. Call the cops and then get arrested probably. Or try his luck with nearby hospitals. He clicks tongue. Well <i>that\u2019s</i> a no-brainer. \u201cDo you know which hospital your aunt works at Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm\u2026the mountain one!\u201d</p><p>The\u2026the <i>what</i>?? But then Tony thinks about it and he can\u2019t help but snort. Mount Sinai. Twenty minutes from here. He looks at Peter again, at that overly endearing, try hard face and resists the urge to ruffle his hair again. <i>The mountain one</i>. </p><p>Jeez, that\u2019s cute.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sit tight kid, I\u2019ll get you home.\u201d But he\u2019s looking so beat up and Tony kinda hates that he came to the park just to get bullied so he pulls out his wallet and hands him a twenty dollar bill. \u201cSee that ice cream cart over there? Go get yourself something while I call your aunt. You deserve it for helping me stick it to those assholes.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide at the money. \u201cReally?? I can get any kind??\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts, \u201cKnock yourself out kid. Just don\u2019t leave my sight. Can\u2019t have you lost twice in one day can we?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, extremely serious, and carefully folds the bill into his hand where it\u2019s clenched tightly. Tony googles the hospital number, waiting for the receptionist to pick up. \u201cHi can I speak to May Parker? It\u2019s about her nephew, Peter.\u201d </p><p>The receptionist, nice girl, manages to snag May from wherever she was pretty quickly. \u201cIs this May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, who is this?\u201d and she\u2019s not rude necessarily, but she\u2019s definitely bordering on I\u2019m gonna lose it unless I know exactly what\u2019s going on in ten seconds and Tony\u2019s kinda surprised she hired someone like Carly to look after her kid. </p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Tony Stark and I found your nephew Peter being bullied by some kids in the park. I got rid of the little idiots but when I tried to bring him back to his parents he said he was with his baby sitter, Carly? And that she had left him alone and he got lost. And he doesn\u2019t know her number but he knows where you work so\u2026\u201d </p><p>It sounds like she\u2019s hyperventilating on the other line. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god is he- is Peter <i>okay</i>? Jesus what the- what the fuck. She lost my kid? She <i>lost</i> <i>Peter</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Parker he\u2019s okay. Scout\u2019s honor. He\u2019s buying ice cream from the cart right now. I can keep you on the line if you want to talk to him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. I need to- yes. And thank you.\u201d she says suddenly, like she\u2019s just remembering something, \u201cFor calling me. I don\u2019t know what I would do if- if-\u201d she breaks off and Tony knows in that moment that May is a good guardian. That she loves Peter. Tremendously. Truly. Epically. </p><p>And he\u2019s grateful too suddenly. That he\u2019s the one who found him. </p><p>\u201cI can bring him to the hospital. If you want.\u201d he offers and it\u2019s so uncharacteristic of him but so was every other fucking thing so far, so why not this.</p><p>She pauses and Tony can tell she\u2019s conflicted over how far her trust of a stranger goes. \u201cMount Sinai, that\u2019s just a bus ride away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d she finally says. \u201cI really can\u2019t afford to leave my shift but I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in twenty minutes tops.\u201d </p><p>Peter is bounding over, holding two sealed popsicles in his hands, a wide smile on his face. \u201cHere\u2019s Peter now,\u201d he holds out the phone, \u201cHey kid, wanna talk to your aunt?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s expression falls, \u201cIs she mad?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cNot at you. She\u2019s worried about you though.\u201d And that triggers the kid\u2019s pure little heart and he trades the popsicles for the phone, holding it tight. </p><p>\u201cMay don\u2019t be worried. I\u2019m okay! Mr. Tony saved me!\u201d </p><p>And shit, Tony wants to just- he doesn\u2019t even know- melt or something??<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know where she went. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to lose her.\u201d But May must have set him straight on whose fault it all really was because Peter looks cowed, pulling absently at his curls. \u201cOkay. Yes. Mr. Tony\u2019s taking me? Okay. Okay, bye May. See you soon. Love you lots too.\u201d </p><p>He says it with so much ease. Like saying and hearing I love you\u2019s was just as normal as breathing. Tony thinks it\u2019s probably just as necessary. We just never knew we were suffocating until it was too late. </p><p>Kids are weird. He knows that. But kids are also\u2026well they\u2019re better than us aren\u2019t they? In a lot of ways. Better at expression and kindness and a genuine open-heartedness that the world hasn\u2019t stifled yet. Peter turns to him, holds out his phone. \u201cTrada ya.\u201d he says, with a toothy grin and Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he was that unabashedly joyful.</p><p>Tony passes over both popsicles and Peter frowns. \u201cThat one\u2019s for you!\u201d he says insistently, pushing one of the popsicles back.</p><p>Tony\u2019s surprised, just kinda staring. \u201cEating ice cream\u2019s no fun alone. But I didn\u2019t know if you liked chocolate or vanilla so I just bought us strawberry popsicles because everyone loves popsicles.\u201d he says matter of factly. </p><p>\u201cOpen it, open it!\u201d Peter chants and Tony peels back the plastic to reveal an artificially pink icy mess that is somehow the most appealing dessert he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cAre we going to go to May\u2019s now?\u201d Peter asks, lips stained pink already. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah. Yeah, let\u2019s go kid. We can still catch the ten.\u201d And like it\u2019s just habit, Peter holds up his hand, not even looking at him, and Tony feels something inexplicable inside him. </p><p>It hits him in that moment, that he\u2019s never held a baby. Seventeen years old and he\u2019s never cradled a newborn. Or smelled that weird newborn smell everyone raved about. He\u2019s never piggy-backed a toddler or lifted them high in the air. He\u2019s never chased a four year old around the kitchen as they shrieked. He\u2019s never walked a child down the street. </p><p>But Peter holds up his hand like he\u2019s absolutely confident that Tony is the responsible kind of adult that will look both ways and make sure the walk sign flashes. He holds up his hand like Tony is a grown up, someone to rely on. Like Tony is someone he can trust. </p><p>And it\u2019s silly. It really isn\u2019t that deep. But on a level Peter doesn\u2019t even acknowledge yet, he believes in Tony and believes he will get him to where he needs to go and <i>of cour</i>se Tony will be able to accomplish this task because he is an <i>adult</i> and he <i>saved </i>him from bullies so <i>of course</i> Tony can do anything. He doesn\u2019t know about all the failures and his father and his mountain of regrets. </p><p>It\u2019s the most refreshing thing Tony\u2019s ever felt. </p><p>He takes Peter\u2019s hand and Peter swings it casually as they walk. And Tony licks his popsicle and feels ridiculously domestic. And weird. And it\u2019s such an out of body experience, he doesn\u2019t even believe it\u2019s him. That it\u2019s his life he\u2019s living right now. </p><p>The bus is rickety and old like everything else in the city, but Peter seems perfectly content just staring out the window. He finishes the last of his popsicle, staring sadly at the stick before sighing melodramatically. He holds out his hand, staring pointedly at Tony\u2019s own. Unsure where this was all going, Tony hands it to him and watches as he maneuvers the delicate balancing game of walking down the aisle, throwing the sticks into the trashcan. Whatever May and Ben Parker did to raise that kid, it was all right. </p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job too?\u201d Peter asks randomly, tearing his eyes away from a particularly bright billboard to stare at Tony. </p><p>\u201cNah. I go to school here. MIT.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cOOHHHH that\u2019s so cool! I wanna go to MIT too!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirk up, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah! I wanna build super cool robots that can like, do all my chores for me because sometimes I wanna help May but I also wanna play with my Lego and I get so distracted that I keep playing and then May gets disappointed at me and that makes me sad.\u201d </p><p>He looks glum for all of two seconds before his giddiness bursts through again, \u201cBut! If I make a robot, then it can do all our chores and then we can all play Lego together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a pretty solid plan squirt. You definitely belong at MIT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you built robots?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuper cool ones.\u201d Tony confirms.</p><p>If possible, Peter\u2019s eyes go wider and Tony <i>swears</i> he sees stars in there. And it strikes him, in that very second, that Peter makes him feel like he\u2019s just the coolest person on the planet. Like he\u2019s valuable beyond compare, wise beyond his years, limitless and undefeatable. And it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s just so different. So fundamentally, utterly different than every other way he\u2019s been looked at before in his whole life and in a sickening turn of events he feels something close to insanely emotional bubble up inside him.</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing in his seat, gripping Tony\u2019s sleeve. \u201cLike what! Like what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you, if you want.\u201d Tony pulls out his phone, scrolling through until he finds what he needs. </p><p>It\u2019s a test video, of DUM-E being operational for the first time. In his entire life, it\u2019s probably the first moment Tony ever felt truly proud of something. Something he did entirely on his own for his own reasons and something that turned out fucking wonderful no matter what anyone else said. </p><p>Peter is in awe the whole time, his fingers clutching Tony\u2019s shirt tighter. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d he breathes, \u201cWow. WOOWWW. You\u2019re like, a real robot scientist! An umm- umm inventor! Yeah! Like Belle\u2019s dad.\u201d he glances up, \u201cYou know, like in Beauty and the Beast?\u201d and Tony just nods weakly, trying not to laugh, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool Mr. Tony! When I grow up, I wanna be like you!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes widen, caught off guard. He coughs, sliding to the next video to distract Peter from his early mid-life crisis but in a good way? He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with him right now. He\u2019s just- he\u2019s just overwhelmed. No one\u2019s\u2026no one\u2019s ever said that before. No one\u2019s ever even implied he could be worth aspiring to. </p><p>His father\u2019s words echo in his head and Tony can\u2019t help but feel a huge surge of <i>fuck you </i>because what did he know? What did Howard know about anything? When had he inspired anyone to do anything except out of fear. Useless, disappointing, never amounting to anything. What did those words mean, in the face of this shameless admiration from a kid who just saw a robot and thought wow that\u2019s cool, let alone having any awareness of the breakthrough that it was and the complexity of everything right down to the name. </p><p>Yeah. DUM-E is cool. Super fucking cool. And he is <i>Tony\u2019s </i>and Tony has a million and one more ideas and he is a goddamn <i>inventor</i>. </p><p>The mechanical voice announces their stop and Tony pulls the yellow string. \u201cThis is us kid. Maybe I\u2019ll show you the rest later.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks disappointed, but hands back Tony\u2019s phone quickly enough, standing close next to him as they wait at the back doors. It\u2019s kinda cute, the kid pressing himself against his leg to avoid all the strangers clustered around them. The doors finally open and Tony keeps a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder as they exit with the rush. He\u2019s pretty confident he knows the way to the hospital from here and the two of them walk in companiable silence broken only by Peter\u2019s commentary about the passing shops and restaurants.</p><p>\u201cAnd that one over there sells the best hot chocolate in the whole city!\u201d Peter declares, pointing energetically at a little hole in the wall.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he had hot chocolate. Or anything that wasn\u2019t just a straight up coffee for that matter. But he smiles, looking deep in thought. \u201cWow. The best huh? That\u2019s a pretty big prize, you sure you did your research.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, looking extremely certain. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. They give you whipped cream without making you pay extra and they put exactly four mini marshmallows and that\u2019s the perfect amount.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Tony says, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Peter copies, looking delighted at the word. </p><p>When Tony enters the hospital, there\u2019s a beautiful woman, mid-thirties probably, with long brown hair and a cute upturned nose pacing in circles in the lobby. \u201cMay!\u201d Peter cries, throwing himself in her direction.</p><p>The woman- May, Tony supposes- turns around, face lighting up in pure relief as she crouches down to squeeze him against her chest. \u201cPeter!\u201d she cries, face buried in his hair.</p><p>Tony stands behind awkwardly, fingers running through his hair in the absence of anything better to do. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d May says, pulling away to inspect him closely. </p><p>Satisfied that he was alright, she looks up, locks eyes with Tony and just scrutinizes him for what feels like a very long fifteen seconds. She stands, Peter trailing after her as she takes Tony\u2019s hand and squeezes. \u201cThank you. For finding him.\u201d Her sincerity makes something choke inside him. </p><p>But Tony is nothing if not great at brushing past feelings that threatened to hold him back and he stretches his lips into a lazy half-smile. \u201cNo need to thank me. Taking down jerks with big egos is a hobby of mine.\u201d </p><p>May quirks a lip before scowling. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe Carly would do that. Of all the stupidly irresponsible things. Anything could have happened if you hadn\u2019t been there. Or worse- if someone else had-\u201d she stops, looks down at Peter and just brushing her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019d recommend getting a new one.\u201d Tony says and May\u2019s expression falls.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long it took me to find <i>this</i> one. You\u2019d think in a city crawling with college kids it\u2019d be easier to find someone but <i>nooo</i>.\u201d she sighs, gives him a tired smile, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to.\u201d she jokes. </p><p>Peter practically explodes. He grabs onto May\u2019s leg, jumping so fasts Tony\u2019s sure he\u2019s going to give himself vertigo, \u201cMay <i>please</i>!!! Mr. Tony\u2019s so cool! He builds robots! He showed me on the bus and he just <i>talks </i>to it and then it <i>moves</i>. Isn\u2019t that so cool!!\u201d </p><p>May stumbles from his weight on her leg, laughing slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool Peter, but I don\u2019t think Tony can do that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually-\u201d Tony cuts off, actually <i>what?</i></p><p>But Peter\u2019s looking at him with those wide excited eyes and Tony feels <i>adored</i> for the first time in his life. Like he was some kind of superhero or something. And he thinks back to his dad and every single syllable that tore right through him and buried themselves in his heart so all the red turned black and bitter. And he thinks about how happy he was, in a weird, tired sort of way, bringing the kid all the way here. And how cool it would be to teach a kid something and then watch them grow with it and use it and change it and make it better. How incredible it is to watch someone grow. </p><p>And he said hadn\u2019t he? That he was craving something different. </p><p>\u201cI could\u2026I\u2019ve never baby-sat before. And I know you just met me. But I can get you references and a criminal record check. And I can tutor him- I study engineering at MIT. I can even bring him in to see the labs, maybe he can mess around a bit in there too.\u201d </p><p>Peter gasps so hard his hands fly to his mouth. </p><p>May takes a look at Peter, then back at Tony. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s a really nice offer. But I don\u2019t know you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could get to know me.\u201d Tony offers, shrugging in that shy way he did in the few times he was ever actually uncomfortable. </p><p>May peers into his eyes like she\u2019s trying to read his soul and slowly, a smile blooms. \u201cAlright Tony. Let\u2019s go get to know you.\u201d </p><p>Trying not to look taken aback, he follows her as she starts walking, \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. There\u2019s something about you\u2026\u201d she smiles, \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything for sure yet, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>One Month Later</p><p>Tony pulls up at the Kiss and Ride in a shiny convertible, sunglasses reflecting the light as he ignores all the staring moms. The bell rings and a rush of students storm out the doors, ushered by concerned teachers and supervisors. Peter comes bursting through, smiling wide when he sees him. \u201cTony!\u201d he yells, throwing open the car door. </p><p>\u201cEasy there squirt, you\u2019re gonna blow a gasket.\u201d Tony laughs, watching to make sure Peter clicked his seat belt in properly.</p><p>\u201cSunglasses please!\u201d Peter sings and Tony hands him a second matching pair that he eagerly slips on. </p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Tony asks, already shifting gears.</p><p>\u201cTime to fly!\u201d</p><p>Tony parks at the Parker\u2019s guest lot, using the house key in Peter\u2019s backpack to let themselves in. Peter throws his bag on the floor, running into his bedroom before Tony holds up a hand. \u201cCease and desist.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s socks skid as he stops. \u201cHomework first.\u201d </p><p>Peter turns around, pout forming, mouth open to whine before Tony beats him to it. \u201cHomework and then we can work on the thing.\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up, \u201cYou promise? Because you said that last time but then you spent all our time trying to make dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I <i>provided</i>. I was being a <i>provider</i>.\u201d Tony retorts, offended.</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve just bought pizza!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne day you\u2019re going to understand what the true college experience is and be just as sick of pizza as I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never growing up!\u201d Peter yells, zooming into his bedroom to get his notebook.</p><p>\u201cI regret showing you Peter Pan.\u201d </p><p>But Tony smiles anyway, setting up the kitchen table with the stuff in Peter\u2019s schoolbag. For the most part, Peter never really needed any help. And it was never even a lot, which made sense considering he was only in the second grade, but still. Routines were good for kids. Apparently. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019d been told anyway. </p><p>Peter makes a dent on some worksheets while Tony whirls through his coding assignment. They work in a nice quiet, interrupted only by Peter closing his duo-tang up and pushing back his chair so he could peer behind Tony\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, \u201cIt\u2019s so colourful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s code. It\u2019s like instructions to make a computer do stuff.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth forms an oh as he tries to take in everything that\u2019s happening. \u201cSo what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell me, nothing. The assignment is to find the flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Peter wrinkles his nose. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it kid.\u201d And Tony pushes his laptop shut before whirling around and grabbing Peter from his perch, spinning him around.</p><p>Peter shrieks with laughter as Tony dances him across to the living room before tossing him on the couch. \u201cAgain! Again! Again!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry Pete, I\u2019m too tired, too old\u2026\u201d Tony says regretfully, dramatically frowning with a woe is me hand placed ever so carefully over his forehead. </p><p>Peter looks crestfallen, looking like he\u2019s about to give in when Tony dives for him again, spinning him around and then launching him onto the cushions. Peter screams, raising his arms to go again. Tony throws him onto the couch until he literally can\u2019t move his arms anymore and he collapses next to Peter. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t be tired yet. We have to do the thing!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre all children tyrants, or is it just you?\u201d Tony teases, pinching Peter\u2019s cheek as he puffs them up. </p><p>Peter pushes against Tony\u2019s shoulder, but he\u2019s so light it hardly makes a difference. \u201cTonyyyy, Tony, Tony, To-nyyyy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeeeter, Peter, Petey-pie, Peter Pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter grins, plopping one little hand atop of Tony\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins from behind Peter\u2019s fingers. \u201cMmm smmsm mm.\u201d he dramatically mumbles and Peter pulls his hand away laughing. </p><p>\u201cOk fine. Grab my phone, put the playlist on, let\u2019s do this.\u201d </p><p>Peter cheers, high-tailing it off the couch to race to the table, plucking Tony\u2019s phone deftly while Tony went into the closet to pull out their project. As the child appropriate rock music burst in the apartment, Peter beams as Tony unveils the Death Star Lego set. It\u2019s five hundred pieces, way more than Peter could ever do on his own, but still less than the one thousand one he saw and Peter had never been more excited to do anything ever in his <i>life</i>. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he struggled with picturing all the tiny pieces coalescing into one whole. Enter Tony. He carefully takes out their well organized pieces in their little plastic bags from the box and sets out their base. \u201cOkay padawan, shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>Peter claps his hands. </p><p>Tony guides Peter through the process, never quite doing it himself, and always giving Peter the opportunity to try his own strategy first. Tony thought it would be tedious, when May first suggested he help the kid out, but there was something so ridiculously gratifying when the light shone in Peter\u2019s eyes when he clicked the right pieces together and the excitement that grew the higher up they built. Tony imagines what his life would have been like if his father had been the one to teach him these things, teach him what he knew about mechanics and innovation and engineering instead of Tony figuring it out all on his own. </p><p>Peter sticks out his tongue when he works, scrutinizing the pieces in his hands. He has to catch himself from looking too fond as he stares. Howard couldn\u2019t have loved him, Tony thinks, if he had willingly missed out on this feeling. To watch a child navigate the world and triumph in their little parts of it is humbling in a way. Made Tony feel smaller. Like the world had shrunk and his problems with it. </p><p>At first, he had no idea what to expect when May had called him asking him to come on as a baby-sitter. He thought it would be tiring and fun and something to piss off his dad with. Except that, from the second he walked into the apartment, he got swept up in a life far away from his own and everything seemed unimportant here. He wasn\u2019t worried about kicking Stanford\u2019s ass at the robotics competition, or the midterms he had coming up, or the way Howard talked to him. Kids are demanding. They have needs and wants and can only ever accomplish 40% of them without an adult and Tony finds himself swept away, part of Peter\u2019s world. </p><p>And he likes it there.</p><p>Tony gets up, ruffles Peter\u2019s hair as he goes. Peter grins up goofily at him, humming to himself as he turns back to his toy. Tony heads into the kitchen, boils some water, sets out two mugs. He mixes in a generous spoonful of Rolo Hot Chocolate Mix, adds exactly four marshmallows and swirls some whipped cream on top. </p><p>\u201cDrink break?\u201d Tony asks as Peter cheers.</p><p>They sit on the floor together, leaning against the couch as they take small sips from their cups. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found me in the park.\u201d Peter randomly says, a little whipped cream mustache on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou got a little something on your face bud,\u201d Tony points at his mouth and Peter struggles to lick everything off, \u201cBut yeah I guess I\u2019m sorta happy with how it all turned out.\u201d He teases.</p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>.\u201d Peter tries to glare but it comes out all wrong and it\u2019s so adorable Tony kinda wants to smack himself, \u201cMay says if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say then you shouldn\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise woman.\u201d Tony agrees.</p><p>\u201cWell I actually have something nice to say. Do you wanna hear it?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns to him, giving him his full, unadulterated attention, batting his eyes comically. Peter\u2019s lip quirks up. \u201cOh wait. I made something to say with this. Wait here Tony!\u201d he commands as though Tony could really go anywhere else.</p><p>Peter slams his room door shut and Tony can hear him fiddling around before he pokes his head out, \u201cClose your eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose my <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes!!\u201d he gestures emphatically at his own and Tony gives him a skeptical look but relents. </p><p>He hears Peter get closer, trying to mask an excited giggle. \u201cOkay, you can open your eyes now.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes open and his heart hiccups. Peter\u2019s giving him the biggest, cheesiest grin as he thrusts out a sloppily painted mug. It\u2019s white, except Peter\u2019s painted it all red in mismatched lines and in gold slanted writing, World\u2019s Funnest Baby-Sitter. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart bursts and he just knows that there is nothing he wouldn\u2019t ever do for Peter. </p><p>Tony would take a bullet for him. </p><p>He would beat the shit out of a million bullies for him.</p><p>He\u2019d build him a <i>real</i> Death Star if that would make him happy. </p><p>He takes the cup and hopes his hands don\u2019t tremble. He\u2019s never felt an endearment like this. He\u2019s never had an adoration this sweet and untainted by him. He grips it tight, examines it all over. \u201cYou\u2019re an artist <i>and</i> inventor? That\u2019s just not fair.\u201d </p><p>Peter clasps his hands behind his back. \u201cD\u2019you like it? May helped me make it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna drink from it every day.\u201d Tony promises.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes glitter. \u201cEven in the lab??\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> in the lab.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool!!\u201d </p><p>And then Peter falls into his chest, arms looping around his neck. And Tony just stares wide-eyed before slowly, his arms wrap around him too. He hugs Peter tightly. Closes his eyes. In Peter\u2019s world, Tony is necessary and needed and capable. In Peter\u2019s world he is admired and loved and inspiring in a way Tony never thought possible. He is Tony Stark, kid genius, engineering prodigy, inheritor of the Stark legacy. But kids are weird. And taking care of kids is weirder. Because the title he likes best is cupped tightly in his hands and the person he most likes being is who he is, right here, holding the world. \u00a0</p></p>",

I\u2019m a disappointment and not good enough for your legacy. You made that crystal clear, congratulations. Truly Hallmark worthy.\u201d Tony snipes, his hand shaking as he clicks the phone shut. </p><p>His jaw can\u2019t unclench. He\u2019s so sick of this. He\u2019s so- he\u2019s so tired. He\u2019s exhausted from the back and forth and the constant circle their lives had become. His phone slides into his back pocket, he looks around. He doesn\u2019t- he doesn\u2019t even know where he <i>is</i>. He\u2019s somewhere off campus- obviously. He\u2019s sure his dorm is around here <i>somewhere</i>. But honestly, he really isn\u2019t all that inclined to look and he doesn\u2019t want to go back to his room and see Rhodey\u2019s empathetic eyes and he doesn\u2019t want to sit in the library and ruminate and he sure as hell doesn\u2019t want to be in the common room listening as everyone in the world enjoys their life more than he ever could. </p><p>So he walks. </p><p>And just\u2026keeps walking. </p><p>And what the hell? He\u2019s seventeen, in his third year (he could\u2019ve graduated by now but a secret, small, totally repressed part of him wanted to slide his tassel with Rhodey beside him), completely ignoring his plethora of assignments and therefore has nothing better to be doing than walking aimlessly in Cambridge on what technically is a nice autumn day. Yeah\u2026the trees are orange. A bit red. Some are yellow. There are some nice piles growing on the sidewalks, some birds flying south in an asymmetrical V. Yup. It\u2019s all so overly pleasantly pretty and just gosh darn it wonderful.</p><p>Tony fucking hates it.</p><p>He loves MIT and he loves Rhodey and he loves building every day in the workshop but God he hates his life. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t hate it. He\u2019s just so tired. <i>All the time</i>. And there\u2019s nothing new and there\u2019s nothing- nothing moving him forward he\u2019s just- he\u2019s stagnant. He\u2019s just still. Trapped. Caught. And he can\u2019t do it anymore he just can\u2019t. And maybe it\u2019s his dad- God it\u2019s always his dad- but he\u2019s sick of always being kicked by the same old shit and he\u2019s sick of doing everything his dad wants and and he\u2019s sick of doing what everyone <i>else</i> wants and yeah Tony Stark has never bowed down to anybody, but can he honestly say he chose any of this? This is <i>his life</i>- why the fuck isn\u2019t he happy? </p><p>Tony kicks a pebble. It stutters across the sidewalk then gets blown into the street, run over by a car. Tony blows a harsh breath. <i>Figures</i>. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Okay so fine. His life is just always the same, nothing ever changes, okay fine. Now he\u2019s here. At a\u2026at a- Tony looks up, quickly scans the street- okay at a bakery and a convenience store and a sketchy dim sum place, a homey shawarma joint, and a sketchier deli. Alright, cool, cool, cool. </p><p>Except, he\u2019s not hungry. Not even a little. </p><p>Feeling like shit does that to you. </p><p>Yeah. He probably is a disappointment. He can\u2019t remember the last time someone looked at him like he was- Tony grimaces. He doesn\u2019t even want to think it. It\u2019s so\u2026well it\u2019s gross is what it is. But fuck it. He\u2019s already being a little bitch about everything, he might as well just admit that he wishes someone would like at him like he was something precious. Or wonderful. Or just\u2026enough. Being just enough would be great. </p><p>Fantastic even.</p><p>Rhodey does. Sometimes. But Rhodey knows him now better than any single person in Tony\u2019s entire life outside of Jarvis when he was alive. And because Rhodey knows him, he sees every one of his faults and wants better for him. Wants to help Tony grow. And that\u2019s great. That\u2019s dandy. That\u2019s just awesome. But it- well\u2026</p><p>Tony looks at Rhodey and sees the goddamn sun. </p><p>Rhodey is brilliant and he\u2019s throw your head back hilarious and he\u2019s witty and he\u2019s strong and he\u2019s <i>kind</i>. Tony doesn\u2019t even know if he has flaws. Maybe being too overprotective. Maybe too overbearing. But Tony craves that. Craves it so deeply. And so he looks at Rhodey and has to squint from how bright he shines and Tony wishes he could be as bright as just one bulb. Just that. </p><p>He wouldn\u2019t dream of being a star. </p><p>His feet wander without him really putting any thought into the matter and the air suddenly smells different. Fresher, wilder, lighter. He looks up and the sky is blocked by a canopy of thick foliage. Sunbeams peek through the gaps and the very leaves glitter. </p><p>He feels like he\u2019s in a fairy tale.</p><p>And Tony\u2019s never really liked nature. Was never into it. Never appreciated it. But in this exact moment, he\u2019s never seen anything more beautiful and he doesn\u2019t know why it strikes him right down to his depths but it does and he just keeps staring. Something tugs in his chest and maybe it\u2019s longing. Maybe it\u2019s hurt. Maybe it\u2019s just a childhood wish he tried to lock deep, deep down and he forces it back under, looks back to the ground. </p><p>He keeps walking. </p><p>He can hear the sounds of kids yelling, laughter ringing in the wind, the little pitter patter of footsteps. He smells the hot-dog stand and the sound of dogs barking as owners threw frisbees and tennis balls. The sun is glowing, gentle, and Tony\u2019s skin feels warm. Loved. It\u2019s despicably idyllic except <i>those fucking kids are ruining it</i>. </p><p>There\u2019s a group of three boys, they look like they\u2019re snot-nosed tweens, thirteen at the max. Tony curls his lip. He hates middle schoolers. God couldn\u2019t put demons on Earth so he gave the world preteens instead. And these boys, these stupid, arrogant, obnoxious little twerps were harassing this shrimp of a kid with floppy brown hair and probably the most pathetic little lip wobble Tony had ever seen. </p><p>The kids are shoving the boy around, laughing as he tries to swallow his tears and push through them, but they hold out their arms and shove him back down. A few tears dribble past his lashes and the kid is red in the face trying to stop. \u201cAwww are you crying? Wow, what a baby. You stupid <i>baby</i>.\u201d The first boy jeers. </p><p>The second boy laughs and shoves the kid back down when he tries to get up and by this point, Tony has had <i>enough</i>. He\u2019s tired and angry and full of repressed emotional trauma and other bullshit that taking it out on a bunch of two-bit good for nothing bullies would <i>really</i> make his day. \u201cHey!\u201d he yells, storming over, chin tilted like he\u2019s looking for a fight. </p><p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i> do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d and when he swears, the kids freeze a little. \u201cYou have two seconds to back the fuck away before I show you who the real big dog at this playground is.\u201d </p><p>The boys stare and the first boy, probably their stupid ring leader, takes on a haughty expression, an air of false confidence about it. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell us what to do-\u201d he starts to say, before Tony pins him with a stare so dark he could have only learned it from his dad. </p><p>He grabs at the boy\u2019s shirt and tugs up so that he\u2019s barely brushing the ground with his toes. Tony might be smaller than all the other third-years, but he\u2019s spent twice as long in the workshops moving part after part and hammering piece after piece. He knows exactly how strong he can be when he tries, and lifting a hundred pound brat off the floor is nothing. Especially not when he\u2019s feeling like this. \u201cYou won\u2019t like me if I have to repeat myself.\u201d he says in a deceptively calm voice.</p><p>The boy gulps and Tony can see that fake bravado chip away. <i>Good</i>, he thinks. The boy slaps at his hands, glaring, \u201cOkay, okay let me go you freak. God.\u201d He rips away from Tony\u2019s grip, gesturing to his friends and they run off. </p><p>Tony watches as they go, \u201cYou pick on this kid or anyone else and you\u2019ll regret it, you hear me!\u201d if the boys hear him, they make no sound of it. </p><p>But Tony knows they did.</p><p>And that\u2019s enough. </p><p>The little boy is still on the ground when Tony turns around, staring up, not in fear anymore, but in a childish wide-eye that plummets him. Something strange takes over him, maybe he\u2019s channeling Jarvis. Trying to do his memory proud. But Tony bends down, gives him half a smile. \u201cHey kid, you good?\u201d</p><p>Shyly, the kid nods, looking up at him with wet, uncertain eyes. He\u2019s got some scratches on his knees and dirt on his arms and hands where he\u2019s been tossed into the ground. That couldn\u2019t be fun. Tony sighs, giving him a stern look. \u201cStay here okay? I\u2019m going to grab some stuff to clean you up.\u201d </p><p>The kid just stares at him but when Tony glances back, he\u2019s standing obediently still. Tony slides a fiver to the hotdog guy, grabs two bottles of water and a bunch of napkins and returns, offering them to the kid. Except he just stares blankly at him and Tony has to unscrew the bottles himself, sprinkling a bit onto the napkins. \u201cThis should get the dirt off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh! Oh yeah. Thank you\u2026\u201d he murmurs, taking the napkins and wiping steadily at his knees. </p><p>And okay, the kid\u2019s trying his best but he\u2019s really just\u2026ineffective. And Tony drops to the floor, gesturing for the kid to join him as he takes the remaining napkins himself, dabbing at his face and elbows. \u201cYou gotta scrub a little harder. Really work the grime off.\u201d Tony remarks, trying to ignore the kid\u2019s shy half stares. </p><p>\u201cOh\u2026okay, I can do it now. I\u2019m not a baby anymore.\u201d he says authoritatively, holding out his hand.</p><p>Tony pauses, squinting his eyes and then glancing all around him as though suddenly remembering children shouldn\u2019t be unsupervised. \u201cAren\u2019t you like, five? Where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not five,\u201d he asserts, \u201cI\u2019m seven and a half.\u201d he says proudly. </p><p>Like Tony really knew the difference between a five and a seven year old. There\u2019s something warm in his placating stare though and the kid seems to pick up on it from how he perks up a little. \u201cOkay so you\u2019re seven. Incredible. Pretty sure you still need parents though.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugs, picking at the grass. \u201cI don\u2019t have parents. Uncle Ben said they died in a plane. So I live with him now. And Aunt May. But they have work so I\u2019m supposed to be with Carly. But she lost me.\u201d </p><p>Tony gapes. Not really knowing where to go from all that. Kids are just- so freaking weird. They have no real concept of anything. Don\u2019t know anything about social etiquette or TMI or like, needing to have at least a level four friendship to unlock each other\u2019s tragic backstories. </p><p>Tony lets his knees fall from under him, sitting properly across from the kid who\u2019s still plucking at the greenery like it had personally offended him. \u201cThis Carly, she your baby-sitter?\u201d </p><p>He looks up finally, giving him a sad look. \u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t think she likes me very much.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s dumb.\u201d Tony says, like he was commenting on something obvious like the sun in their faces. </p><p>He\u2019s surprised.</p><p>At himself.</p><p>Which is\u2026also weird.</p><p>The kid looks surprised too. But cutely so. He ducks his head, shy. \u201cSo she lost you? She left you? By yourself??\u201d and Tony kinda hates this Carly chick, whoever the hell she is.</p><p>The kid\u2019s all bruised up and probably just went through his least traumatic, but still traumatic life experience, because she decided to what, gab with her stupid boyfriend or something? And the kid\u2019s looking all flustered and apologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t know! I stayed where she told me to stay but then she left to get something from the store and then she didn\u2019t come back but I moved a little so maybe it\u2019s my fault but then I got lost and then those boys found me and they were being mean to me and I didn\u2019t know what to do but then you saved me!\u201d and he looks so endeared, like what Tony did was something amazing, utterly incredible. </p><p>He looks like a goddamn chipmunk with absurdly cute cartoon eyes. Or something. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Tony mumbles but the kid shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cWhaaat? You were so cool! You were like hey! And then you said a bad word but it\u2019s okay because they were mean and sometimes Ben says bad words to bad guys too and then you were like go away! And they were like no! And then you got all scary but in a cool way and then they ran!\u201d And his hands are flying all over the place as he retells the moment and he looks so excited, so <i>involved,</i> that Tony almost believes he was as cool as the kid thinks.</p><p>\u201cWell they were being giant wastes of space, so.\u201d Tony shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that bad about it.\u201d</p><p>Tony looks around again, at all the kids with their parents and looks back at the chipmunk. \u201cYou got a name kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter! Peter Benjamin Parker!\u201d he grins.</p><p>And Tony really doesn\u2019t know why he does it, but he sticks out his hand and says, \u201cI\u2019m Tony.\u201d </p><p>And Peter stares at his hand for a few seconds before reaching out to shake it, his hand so small in Tony\u2019s own.</p><p>\u201cWell lest I be accused of kidnapping, we should probably get you back with your baby sitter.\u201d </p><p>Peter deflates a little, letting out a little \u201cOh.\u201d </p><p>Tony ignores how cute that is. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you know her number or anything?\u201d</p><p>Peter stares blankly. \u201cHow about your aunt? Or your uncle?\u201d </p><p>Peter chews on his lip, thinking very intently, his nose all scrunched up. \u201cUmm I think\u2026there was definitely a five-four-five and umm\u2026maybe a two?\u201d his face falls, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Tony, I was supposed to memorize their numbers a long time ago but I keep forgetting them.\u201d he looks down, like he\u2019s expecting to be reprimanded but Tony just ruffles his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seventeen and I couldn\u2019t tell you what the first number of either of my parents\u2019 numbers are. Don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d </p><p>But the fact remained, he still had a kid he needed to get home somehow without really all that much to go on. \u201cWhat about your aunt and uncle\u2019s work. What do they do?\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up and Tony sees the pride and admiration he has in his eyes so clearly it hurts. \u201cBen is so cool! He\u2019s a cop and he finds bad guys and he\u2019s like, a superhero.\u201d Peter says, very seriously, \u201cAnd May is a nurse! She saves people\u2019s <i>lives</i>.\u201d And he looks very intent. Very serious. </p><p>Tony smiles, \u201cWow. They sound like very important people.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods fiercely. \u201cVery very important.\u201d</p><p>So Tony weighs his options. Call the cops and then get arrested probably. Or try his luck with nearby hospitals. He clicks tongue. Well <i>that\u2019s</i> a no-brainer. \u201cDo you know which hospital your aunt works at Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm\u2026the mountain one!\u201d</p><p>The\u2026the <i>what</i>?? But then Tony thinks about it and he can\u2019t help but snort. Mount Sinai. Twenty minutes from here. He looks at Peter again, at that overly endearing, try hard face and resists the urge to ruffle his hair again. <i>The mountain one</i>. </p><p>Jeez, that\u2019s cute.</p><p>\u201cOkay, sit tight kid, I\u2019ll get you home.\u201d But he\u2019s looking so beat up and Tony kinda hates that he came to the park just to get bullied so he pulls out his wallet and hands him a twenty dollar bill. \u201cSee that ice cream cart over there? Go get yourself something while I call your aunt. You deserve it for helping me stick it to those assholes.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide at the money. \u201cReally?? I can get any kind??\u201d </p><p>Tony snorts, \u201cKnock yourself out kid. Just don\u2019t leave my sight. Can\u2019t have you lost twice in one day can we?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, extremely serious, and carefully folds the bill into his hand where it\u2019s clenched tightly. Tony googles the hospital number, waiting for the receptionist to pick up. \u201cHi can I speak to May Parker? It\u2019s about her nephew, Peter.\u201d </p><p>The receptionist, nice girl, manages to snag May from wherever she was pretty quickly. \u201cIs this May?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, who is this?\u201d and she\u2019s not rude necessarily, but she\u2019s definitely bordering on I\u2019m gonna lose it unless I know exactly what\u2019s going on in ten seconds and Tony\u2019s kinda surprised she hired someone like Carly to look after her kid. </p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Tony Stark and I found your nephew Peter being bullied by some kids in the park. I got rid of the little idiots but when I tried to bring him back to his parents he said he was with his baby sitter, Carly? And that she had left him alone and he got lost. And he doesn\u2019t know her number but he knows where you work so\u2026\u201d </p><p>It sounds like she\u2019s hyperventilating on the other line. \u201cOh my god. Oh my god is he- is Peter <i>okay</i>? Jesus what the- what the fuck. She lost my kid? She <i>lost</i> <i>Peter</i>?!\u201d </p><p>\u201cMs. Parker he\u2019s okay. Scout\u2019s honor. He\u2019s buying ice cream from the cart right now. I can keep you on the line if you want to talk to him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please. I need to- yes. And thank you.\u201d she says suddenly, like she\u2019s just remembering something, \u201cFor calling me. I don\u2019t know what I would do if- if-\u201d she breaks off and Tony knows in that moment that May is a good guardian. That she loves Peter. Tremendously. Truly. Epically. </p><p>And he\u2019s grateful too suddenly. That he\u2019s the one who found him. </p><p>\u201cI can bring him to the hospital. If you want.\u201d he offers and it\u2019s so uncharacteristic of him but so was every other fucking thing so far, so why not this.</p><p>She pauses and Tony can tell she\u2019s conflicted over how far her trust of a stranger goes. \u201cMount Sinai, that\u2019s just a bus ride away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d she finally says. \u201cI really can\u2019t afford to leave my shift but I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in twenty minutes tops.\u201d </p><p>Peter is bounding over, holding two sealed popsicles in his hands, a wide smile on his face. \u201cHere\u2019s Peter now,\u201d he holds out the phone, \u201cHey kid, wanna talk to your aunt?\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s expression falls, \u201cIs she mad?\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cNot at you. She\u2019s worried about you though.\u201d And that triggers the kid\u2019s pure little heart and he trades the popsicles for the phone, holding it tight. </p><p>\u201cMay don\u2019t be worried. I\u2019m okay! Mr. Tony saved me!\u201d </p><p>And shit, Tony wants to just- he doesn\u2019t even know- melt or something??<br></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know where she went. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to lose her.\u201d But May must have set him straight on whose fault it all really was because Peter looks cowed, pulling absently at his curls. \u201cOkay. Yes. Mr. Tony\u2019s taking me? Okay. Okay, bye May. See you soon. Love you lots too.\u201d </p><p>He says it with so much ease. Like saying and hearing I love you\u2019s was just as normal as breathing. Tony thinks it\u2019s probably just as necessary. We just never knew we were suffocating until it was too late. </p><p>Kids are weird. He knows that. But kids are also\u2026well they\u2019re better than us aren\u2019t they? In a lot of ways. Better at expression and kindness and a genuine open-heartedness that the world hasn\u2019t stifled yet. Peter turns to him, holds out his phone. \u201cTrada ya.\u201d he says, with a toothy grin and Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he was that unabashedly joyful.</p><p>Tony passes over both popsicles and Peter frowns. \u201cThat one\u2019s for you!\u201d he says insistently, pushing one of the popsicles back.</p><p>Tony\u2019s surprised, just kinda staring. \u201cEating ice cream\u2019s no fun alone. But I didn\u2019t know if you liked chocolate or vanilla so I just bought us strawberry popsicles because everyone loves popsicles.\u201d he says matter of factly. </p><p>\u201cOpen it, open it!\u201d Peter chants and Tony peels back the plastic to reveal an artificially pink icy mess that is somehow the most appealing dessert he\u2019s ever seen. </p><p>\u201cAre we going to go to May\u2019s now?\u201d Peter asks, lips stained pink already. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah. Yeah, let\u2019s go kid. We can still catch the ten.\u201d And like it\u2019s just habit, Peter holds up his hand, not even looking at him, and Tony feels something inexplicable inside him. </p><p>It hits him in that moment, that he\u2019s never held a baby. Seventeen years old and he\u2019s never cradled a newborn. Or smelled that weird newborn smell everyone raved about. He\u2019s never piggy-backed a toddler or lifted them high in the air. He\u2019s never chased a four year old around the kitchen as they shrieked. He\u2019s never walked a child down the street. </p><p>But Peter holds up his hand like he\u2019s absolutely confident that Tony is the responsible kind of adult that will look both ways and make sure the walk sign flashes. He holds up his hand like Tony is a grown up, someone to rely on. Like Tony is someone he can trust. </p><p>And it\u2019s silly. It really isn\u2019t that deep. But on a level Peter doesn\u2019t even acknowledge yet, he believes in Tony and believes he will get him to where he needs to go and <i>of cour</i>se Tony will be able to accomplish this task because he is an <i>adult</i> and he <i>saved </i>him from bullies so <i>of course</i> Tony can do anything. He doesn\u2019t know about all the failures and his father and his mountain of regrets. </p><p>It\u2019s the most refreshing thing Tony\u2019s ever felt. </p><p>He takes Peter\u2019s hand and Peter swings it casually as they walk. And Tony licks his popsicle and feels ridiculously domestic. And weird. And it\u2019s such an out of body experience, he doesn\u2019t even believe it\u2019s him. That it\u2019s his life he\u2019s living right now. </p><p>The bus is rickety and old like everything else in the city, but Peter seems perfectly content just staring out the window. He finishes the last of his popsicle, staring sadly at the stick before sighing melodramatically. He holds out his hand, staring pointedly at Tony\u2019s own. Unsure where this was all going, Tony hands it to him and watches as he maneuvers the delicate balancing game of walking down the aisle, throwing the sticks into the trashcan. Whatever May and Ben Parker did to raise that kid, it was all right. </p><p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job too?\u201d Peter asks randomly, tearing his eyes away from a particularly bright billboard to stare at Tony. </p><p>\u201cNah. I go to school here. MIT.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cOOHHHH that\u2019s so cool! I wanna go to MIT too!\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips quirk up, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Yeah! Yeah! I wanna build super cool robots that can like, do all my chores for me because sometimes I wanna help May but I also wanna play with my Lego and I get so distracted that I keep playing and then May gets disappointed at me and that makes me sad.\u201d </p><p>He looks glum for all of two seconds before his giddiness bursts through again, \u201cBut! If I make a robot, then it can do all our chores and then we can all play Lego together.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a pretty solid plan squirt. You definitely belong at MIT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you built robots?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSuper cool ones.\u201d Tony confirms.</p><p>If possible, Peter\u2019s eyes go wider and Tony <i>swears</i> he sees stars in there. And it strikes him, in that very second, that Peter makes him feel like he\u2019s just the coolest person on the planet. Like he\u2019s valuable beyond compare, wise beyond his years, limitless and undefeatable. And it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s just so different. So fundamentally, utterly different than every other way he\u2019s been looked at before in his whole life and in a sickening turn of events he feels something close to insanely emotional bubble up inside him.</p><p>Peter\u2019s practically bouncing in his seat, gripping Tony\u2019s sleeve. \u201cLike what! Like what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you, if you want.\u201d Tony pulls out his phone, scrolling through until he finds what he needs. </p><p>It\u2019s a test video, of DUM-E being operational for the first time. In his entire life, it\u2019s probably the first moment Tony ever felt truly proud of something. Something he did entirely on his own for his own reasons and something that turned out fucking wonderful no matter what anyone else said. </p><p>Peter is in awe the whole time, his fingers clutching Tony\u2019s shirt tighter. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d he breathes, \u201cWow. WOOWWW. You\u2019re like, a real robot scientist! An umm- umm inventor! Yeah! Like Belle\u2019s dad.\u201d he glances up, \u201cYou know, like in Beauty and the Beast?\u201d and Tony just nods weakly, trying not to laugh, \u201cThat\u2019s so cool Mr. Tony! When I grow up, I wanna be like you!\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes widen, caught off guard. He coughs, sliding to the next video to distract Peter from his early mid-life crisis but in a good way? He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with him right now. He\u2019s just- he\u2019s just overwhelmed. No one\u2019s\u2026no one\u2019s ever said that before. No one\u2019s ever even implied he could be worth aspiring to. </p><p>His father\u2019s words echo in his head and Tony can\u2019t help but feel a huge surge of <i>fuck you </i>because what did he know? What did Howard know about anything? When had he inspired anyone to do anything except out of fear. Useless, disappointing, never amounting to anything. What did those words mean, in the face of this shameless admiration from a kid who just saw a robot and thought wow that\u2019s cool, let alone having any awareness of the breakthrough that it was and the complexity of everything right down to the name. </p><p>Yeah. DUM-E is cool. Super fucking cool. And he is <i>Tony\u2019s </i>and Tony has a million and one more ideas and he is a goddamn <i>inventor</i>. </p><p>The mechanical voice announces their stop and Tony pulls the yellow string. \u201cThis is us kid. Maybe I\u2019ll show you the rest later.\u201d</p><p>Peter looks disappointed, but hands back Tony\u2019s phone quickly enough, standing close next to him as they wait at the back doors. It\u2019s kinda cute, the kid pressing himself against his leg to avoid all the strangers clustered around them. The doors finally open and Tony keeps a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder as they exit with the rush. He\u2019s pretty confident he knows the way to the hospital from here and the two of them walk in companiable silence broken only by Peter\u2019s commentary about the passing shops and restaurants.</p><p>\u201cAnd that one over there sells the best hot chocolate in the whole city!\u201d Peter declares, pointing energetically at a little hole in the wall.</p><p>Tony can\u2019t remember the last time he had hot chocolate. Or anything that wasn\u2019t just a straight up coffee for that matter. But he smiles, looking deep in thought. \u201cWow. The best huh? That\u2019s a pretty big prize, you sure you did your research.\u201d</p><p>Peter nods, looking extremely certain. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. They give you whipped cream without making you pay extra and they put exactly four mini marshmallows and that\u2019s the perfect amount.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Tony says, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Peter copies, looking delighted at the word. </p><p>When Tony enters the hospital, there\u2019s a beautiful woman, mid-thirties probably, with long brown hair and a cute upturned nose pacing in circles in the lobby. \u201cMay!\u201d Peter cries, throwing himself in her direction.</p><p>The woman- May, Tony supposes- turns around, face lighting up in pure relief as she crouches down to squeeze him against her chest. \u201cPeter!\u201d she cries, face buried in his hair.</p><p>Tony stands behind awkwardly, fingers running through his hair in the absence of anything better to do. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d May says, pulling away to inspect him closely. </p><p>Satisfied that he was alright, she looks up, locks eyes with Tony and just scrutinizes him for what feels like a very long fifteen seconds. She stands, Peter trailing after her as she takes Tony\u2019s hand and squeezes. \u201cThank you. For finding him.\u201d Her sincerity makes something choke inside him. </p><p>But Tony is nothing if not great at brushing past feelings that threatened to hold him back and he stretches his lips into a lazy half-smile. \u201cNo need to thank me. Taking down jerks with big egos is a hobby of mine.\u201d </p><p>May quirks a lip before scowling. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe Carly would do that. Of all the stupidly irresponsible things. Anything could have happened if you hadn\u2019t been there. Or worse- if someone else had-\u201d she stops, looks down at Peter and just brushing her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026I\u2019d recommend getting a new one.\u201d Tony says and May\u2019s expression falls.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how long it took me to find <i>this</i> one. You\u2019d think in a city crawling with college kids it\u2019d be easier to find someone but <i>nooo</i>.\u201d she sighs, gives him a tired smile, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to.\u201d she jokes. </p><p>Peter practically explodes. He grabs onto May\u2019s leg, jumping so fasts Tony\u2019s sure he\u2019s going to give himself vertigo, \u201cMay <i>please</i>!!! Mr. Tony\u2019s so cool! He builds robots! He showed me on the bus and he just <i>talks </i>to it and then it <i>moves</i>. Isn\u2019t that so cool!!\u201d </p><p>May stumbles from his weight on her leg, laughing slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool Peter, but I don\u2019t think Tony can do that\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually-\u201d Tony cuts off, actually <i>what?</i></p><p>But Peter\u2019s looking at him with those wide excited eyes and Tony feels <i>adored</i> for the first time in his life. Like he was some kind of superhero or something. And he thinks back to his dad and every single syllable that tore right through him and buried themselves in his heart so all the red turned black and bitter. And he thinks about how happy he was, in a weird, tired sort of way, bringing the kid all the way here. And how cool it would be to teach a kid something and then watch them grow with it and use it and change it and make it better. How incredible it is to watch someone grow. </p><p>And he said hadn\u2019t he? That he was craving something different. </p><p>\u201cI could\u2026I\u2019ve never baby-sat before. And I know you just met me. But I can get you references and a criminal record check. And I can tutor him- I study engineering at MIT. I can even bring him in to see the labs, maybe he can mess around a bit in there too.\u201d </p><p>Peter gasps so hard his hands fly to his mouth. </p><p>May takes a look at Peter, then back at Tony. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s a really nice offer. But I don\u2019t know you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou could get to know me.\u201d Tony offers, shrugging in that shy way he did in the few times he was ever actually uncomfortable. </p><p>May peers into his eyes like she\u2019s trying to read his soul and slowly, a smile blooms. \u201cAlright Tony. Let\u2019s go get to know you.\u201d </p><p>Trying not to look taken aback, he follows her as she starts walking, \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. There\u2019s something about you\u2026\u201d she smiles, \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything for sure yet, but I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d </p><p>One Month Later</p><p>Tony pulls up at the Kiss and Ride in a shiny convertible, sunglasses reflecting the light as he ignores all the staring moms. The bell rings and a rush of students storm out the doors, ushered by concerned teachers and supervisors. Peter comes bursting through, smiling wide when he sees him. \u201cTony!\u201d he yells, throwing open the car door. </p><p>\u201cEasy there squirt, you\u2019re gonna blow a gasket.\u201d Tony laughs, watching to make sure Peter clicked his seat belt in properly.</p><p>\u201cSunglasses please!\u201d Peter sings and Tony hands him a second matching pair that he eagerly slips on. </p><p>\u201cAll set?\u201d Tony asks, already shifting gears.</p><p>\u201cTime to fly!\u201d</p><p>Tony parks at the Parker\u2019s guest lot, using the house key in Peter\u2019s backpack to let themselves in. Peter throws his bag on the floor, running into his bedroom before Tony holds up a hand. \u201cCease and desist.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s socks skid as he stops. \u201cHomework first.\u201d </p><p>Peter turns around, pout forming, mouth open to whine before Tony beats him to it. \u201cHomework and then we can work on the thing.\u201d</p><p>Peter lights up, \u201cYou promise? Because you said that last time but then you spent all our time trying to make dinner.\u201d </p><p>\u201cExcuse you. I <i>provided</i>. I was being a <i>provider</i>.\u201d Tony retorts, offended.</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve just bought pizza!\u201d </p><p>\u201cOne day you\u2019re going to understand what the true college experience is and be just as sick of pizza as I am.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never growing up!\u201d Peter yells, zooming into his bedroom to get his notebook.</p><p>\u201cI regret showing you Peter Pan.\u201d </p><p>But Tony smiles anyway, setting up the kitchen table with the stuff in Peter\u2019s schoolbag. For the most part, Peter never really needed any help. And it was never even a lot, which made sense considering he was only in the second grade, but still. Routines were good for kids. Apparently. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019d been told anyway. </p><p>Peter makes a dent on some worksheets while Tony whirls through his coding assignment. They work in a nice quiet, interrupted only by Peter closing his duo-tang up and pushing back his chair so he could peer behind Tony\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, \u201cIt\u2019s so colourful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s code. It\u2019s like instructions to make a computer do stuff.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s mouth forms an oh as he tries to take in everything that\u2019s happening. \u201cSo what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell me, nothing. The assignment is to find the flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Peter wrinkles his nose. </p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it kid.\u201d And Tony pushes his laptop shut before whirling around and grabbing Peter from his perch, spinning him around.</p><p>Peter shrieks with laughter as Tony dances him across to the living room before tossing him on the couch. \u201cAgain! Again! Again!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry Pete, I\u2019m too tired, too old\u2026\u201d Tony says regretfully, dramatically frowning with a woe is me hand placed ever so carefully over his forehead. </p><p>Peter looks crestfallen, looking like he\u2019s about to give in when Tony dives for him again, spinning him around and then launching him onto the cushions. Peter screams, raising his arms to go again. Tony throws him onto the couch until he literally can\u2019t move his arms anymore and he collapses next to Peter. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t be tired yet. We have to do the thing!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAre all children tyrants, or is it just you?\u201d Tony teases, pinching Peter\u2019s cheek as he puffs them up. </p><p>Peter pushes against Tony\u2019s shoulder, but he\u2019s so light it hardly makes a difference. \u201cTonyyyy, Tony, Tony, To-nyyyy.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeeeter, Peter, Petey-pie, Peter Pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Peter grins, plopping one little hand atop of Tony\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>Tony grins from behind Peter\u2019s fingers. \u201cMmm smmsm mm.\u201d he dramatically mumbles and Peter pulls his hand away laughing. </p><p>\u201cOk fine. Grab my phone, put the playlist on, let\u2019s do this.\u201d </p><p>Peter cheers, high-tailing it off the couch to race to the table, plucking Tony\u2019s phone deftly while Tony went into the closet to pull out their project. As the child appropriate rock music burst in the apartment, Peter beams as Tony unveils the Death Star Lego set. It\u2019s five hundred pieces, way more than Peter could ever do on his own, but still less than the one thousand one he saw and Peter had never been more excited to do anything ever in his <i>life</i>. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he struggled with picturing all the tiny pieces coalescing into one whole. Enter Tony. He carefully takes out their well organized pieces in their little plastic bags from the box and sets out their base. \u201cOkay padawan, shall we begin?\u201d</p><p>Peter claps his hands. </p><p>Tony guides Peter through the process, never quite doing it himself, and always giving Peter the opportunity to try his own strategy first. Tony thought it would be tedious, when May first suggested he help the kid out, but there was something so ridiculously gratifying when the light shone in Peter\u2019s eyes when he clicked the right pieces together and the excitement that grew the higher up they built. Tony imagines what his life would have been like if his father had been the one to teach him these things, teach him what he knew about mechanics and innovation and engineering instead of Tony figuring it out all on his own. </p><p>Peter sticks out his tongue when he works, scrutinizing the pieces in his hands. He has to catch himself from looking too fond as he stares. Howard couldn\u2019t have loved him, Tony thinks, if he had willingly missed out on this feeling. To watch a child navigate the world and triumph in their little parts of it is humbling in a way. Made Tony feel smaller. Like the world had shrunk and his problems with it. </p><p>At first, he had no idea what to expect when May had called him asking him to come on as a baby-sitter. He thought it would be tiring and fun and something to piss off his dad with. Except that, from the second he walked into the apartment, he got swept up in a life far away from his own and everything seemed unimportant here. He wasn\u2019t worried about kicking Stanford\u2019s ass at the robotics competition, or the midterms he had coming up, or the way Howard talked to him. Kids are demanding. They have needs and wants and can only ever accomplish 40% of them without an adult and Tony finds himself swept away, part of Peter\u2019s world. </p><p>And he likes it there.</p><p>Tony gets up, ruffles Peter\u2019s hair as he goes. Peter grins up goofily at him, humming to himself as he turns back to his toy. Tony heads into the kitchen, boils some water, sets out two mugs. He mixes in a generous spoonful of Rolo Hot Chocolate Mix, adds exactly four marshmallows and swirls some whipped cream on top. </p><p>\u201cDrink break?\u201d Tony asks as Peter cheers.</p><p>They sit on the floor together, leaning against the couch as they take small sips from their cups. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found me in the park.\u201d Peter randomly says, a little whipped cream mustache on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou got a little something on your face bud,\u201d Tony points at his mouth and Peter struggles to lick everything off, \u201cBut yeah I guess I\u2019m sorta happy with how it all turned out.\u201d He teases.</p><p>\u201c<i>Hey</i>.\u201d Peter tries to glare but it comes out all wrong and it\u2019s so adorable Tony kinda wants to smack himself, \u201cMay says if you don\u2019t have anything nice to say then you shouldn\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise woman.\u201d Tony agrees.</p><p>\u201cWell I actually have something nice to say. Do you wanna hear it?\u201d</p><p>Tony turns to him, giving him his full, unadulterated attention, batting his eyes comically. Peter\u2019s lip quirks up. \u201cOh wait. I made something to say with this. Wait here Tony!\u201d he commands as though Tony could really go anywhere else.</p><p>Peter slams his room door shut and Tony can hear him fiddling around before he pokes his head out, \u201cClose your eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose my <i>what</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes!!\u201d he gestures emphatically at his own and Tony gives him a skeptical look but relents. </p><p>He hears Peter get closer, trying to mask an excited giggle. \u201cOkay, you can open your eyes now.\u201d </p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes open and his heart hiccups. Peter\u2019s giving him the biggest, cheesiest grin as he thrusts out a sloppily painted mug. It\u2019s white, except Peter\u2019s painted it all red in mismatched lines and in gold slanted writing, World\u2019s Funnest Baby-Sitter. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart bursts and he just knows that there is nothing he wouldn\u2019t ever do for Peter. </p><p>Tony would take a bullet for him. </p><p>He would beat the shit out of a million bullies for him.</p><p>He\u2019d build him a <i>real</i> Death Star if that would make him happy. </p><p>He takes the cup and hopes his hands don\u2019t tremble. He\u2019s never felt an endearment like this. He\u2019s never had an adoration this sweet and untainted by him. He grips it tight, examines it all over. \u201cYou\u2019re an artist <i>and</i> inventor? That\u2019s just not fair.\u201d </p><p>Peter clasps his hands behind his back. \u201cD\u2019you like it? May helped me make it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna drink from it every day.\u201d Tony promises.</p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes glitter. \u201cEven in the lab??\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Especially</i> in the lab.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCool!!\u201d </p><p>And then Peter falls into his chest, arms looping around his neck. And Tony just stares wide-eyed before slowly, his arms wrap around him too. He hugs Peter tightly. Closes his eyes. In Peter\u2019s world, Tony is necessary and needed and capable. In Peter\u2019s world he is admired and loved and inspiring in a way Tony never thought possible. He is Tony Stark, kid genius, engineering prodigy, inheritor of the Stark legacy. But kids are weird. And taking care of kids is weirder. Because the title he likes best is cupped tightly in his hands and the person he most likes being is who he is, right here, holding the world. \u00a0</p></p>",

I&rsquo;m a disappointment and not good enough for your legacy. You made that crystal clear, congratulations. Truly Hallmark worthy.&rdquo; Tony snipes, his hand shaking as he clicks the phone shut. </p><p>His jaw can&rsquo;t unclench. He&rsquo;s so sick of this. He&rsquo;s so- he&rsquo;s so tired. He&rsquo;s exhausted from the back and forth and the constant circle their lives had become. His phone slides into his back pocket, he looks around. He doesn&rsquo;t- he doesn&rsquo;t even know where he <i>is</i>. He&rsquo;s somewhere off campus- obviously. He&rsquo;s sure his dorm is around here <i>somewhere</i>. But honestly, he really isn&rsquo;t all that inclined to look and he doesn&rsquo;t want to go back to his room and see Rhodey&rsquo;s empathetic eyes and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sit in the library and ruminate and he sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t want to be in the common room listening as everyone in the world enjoys their life more than he ever could. </p><p>So he walks. </p><p>And just&hellip;keeps walking. </p><p>And what the hell? He&rsquo;s seventeen, in his third year (he could&rsquo;ve graduated by now but a secret, small, totally repressed part of him wanted to slide his tassel with Rhodey beside him), completely ignoring his plethora of assignments and therefore has nothing better to be doing than walking aimlessly in Cambridge on what technically is a nice autumn day. Yeah&hellip;the trees are orange. A bit red. Some are yellow. There are some nice piles growing on the sidewalks, some birds flying south in an asymmetrical V. Yup. It&rsquo;s all so overly pleasantly pretty and just gosh darn it wonderful.</p><p>Tony fucking hates it.</p><p>He loves MIT and he loves Rhodey and he loves building every day in the workshop but God he hates his life. Or maybe he doesn&rsquo;t hate it. He&rsquo;s just so tired. <i>All the time</i>. And there&rsquo;s nothing new and there&rsquo;s nothing- nothing moving him forward he&rsquo;s just- he&rsquo;s stagnant. He&rsquo;s just still. Trapped. Caught. And he can&rsquo;t do it anymore he just can&rsquo;t. And maybe it&rsquo;s his dad- God it&rsquo;s always his dad- but he&rsquo;s sick of always being kicked by the same old shit and he&rsquo;s sick of doing everything his dad wants and and he&rsquo;s sick of doing what everyone <i>else</i> wants and yeah Tony Stark has never bowed down to anybody, but can he honestly say he chose any of this? This is <i>his life</i>- why the fuck isn&rsquo;t he happy? </p><p>Tony kicks a pebble. It stutters across the sidewalk then gets blown into the street, run over by a car. Tony blows a harsh breath. <i>Figures</i>. </p><p>Okay so fine. His life is just always the same, nothing ever changes, okay fine. Now he&rsquo;s here. At a&hellip;at a- Tony looks up, quickly scans the street- okay at a bakery and a convenience store and a sketchy dim sum place, a homey shawarma joint, and a sketchier deli. Alright, cool, cool, cool. </p><p>Except, he&rsquo;s not hungry. Not even a little. </p><p>Feeling like shit does that to you. </p><p>Yeah. He probably is a disappointment. He can&rsquo;t remember the last time someone looked at him like he was- Tony grimaces. He doesn&rsquo;t even want to think it. It&rsquo;s so&hellip;well it&rsquo;s gross is what it is. But fuck it. He&rsquo;s already being a little bitch about everything, he might as well just admit that he wishes someone would like at him like he was something precious. Or wonderful. Or just&hellip;enough. Being just enough would be great. </p><p>Fantastic even.</p><p>Rhodey does. Sometimes. But Rhodey knows him now better than any single person in Tony&rsquo;s entire life outside of Jarvis when he was alive. And because Rhodey knows him, he sees every one of his faults and wants better for him. Wants to help Tony grow. And that&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s dandy. That&rsquo;s just awesome. But it- well&hellip;</p><p>Tony looks at Rhodey and sees the goddamn sun. </p><p>Rhodey is brilliant and he&rsquo;s throw your head back hilarious and he&rsquo;s witty and he&rsquo;s strong and he&rsquo;s <i>kind</i>. Tony doesn&rsquo;t even know if he has flaws. Maybe being too overprotective. Maybe too overbearing. But Tony craves that. Craves it so deeply. And so he looks at Rhodey and has to squint from how bright he shines and Tony wishes he could be as bright as just one bulb. Just that. </p><p>He wouldn&rsquo;t dream of being a star. </p><p>His feet wander without him really putting any thought into the matter and the air suddenly smells different. Fresher, wilder, lighter. He looks up and the sky is blocked by a canopy of thick foliage. Sunbeams peek through the gaps and the very leaves glitter. </p><p>He feels like he&rsquo;s in a fairy tale.</p><p>And Tony&rsquo;s never really liked nature. Was never into it. Never appreciated it. But in this exact moment, he&rsquo;s never seen anything more beautiful and he doesn&rsquo;t know why it strikes him right down to his depths but it does and he just keeps staring. Something tugs in his chest and maybe it&rsquo;s longing. Maybe it&rsquo;s hurt. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a childhood wish he tried to lock deep, deep down and he forces it back under, looks back to the ground. </p><p>He keeps walking. </p><p>He can hear the sounds of kids yelling, laughter ringing in the wind, the little pitter patter of footsteps. He smells the hot-dog stand and the sound of dogs barking as owners threw frisbees and tennis balls. The sun is glowing, gentle, and Tony&rsquo;s skin feels warm. Loved. It&rsquo;s despicably idyllic except <i>those fucking kids are ruining it</i>. </p><p>There&rsquo;s a group of three boys, they look like they&rsquo;re snot-nosed tweens, thirteen at the max. Tony curls his lip. He hates middle schoolers. God couldn&rsquo;t put demons on Earth so he gave the world preteens instead. And these boys, these stupid, arrogant, obnoxious little twerps were harassing this shrimp of a kid with floppy brown hair and probably the most pathetic little lip wobble Tony had ever seen. </p><p>The kids are shoving the boy around, laughing as he tries to swallow his tears and push through them, but they hold out their arms and shove him back down. A few tears dribble past his lashes and the kid is red in the face trying to stop. &ldquo;Awww are you crying? Wow, what a baby. You stupid <i>baby</i>.&rdquo; The first boy jeers. </p><p>The second boy laughs and shoves the kid back down when he tries to get up and by this point, Tony has had <i>enough</i>. He&rsquo;s tired and angry and full of repressed emotional trauma and other bullshit that taking it out on a bunch of two-bit good for nothing bullies would <i>really</i> make his day. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he yells, storming over, chin tilted like he&rsquo;s looking for a fight. </p><p>&ldquo;What the <i>fuck</i> do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; and when he swears, the kids freeze a little. &ldquo;You have two seconds to back the fuck away before I show you who the real big dog at this playground is.&rdquo; </p><p>The boys stare and the first boy, probably their stupid ring leader, takes on a haughty expression, an air of false confidence about it. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell us what to do-&rdquo; he starts to say, before Tony pins him with a stare so dark he could have only learned it from his dad. </p><p>He grabs at the boy&rsquo;s shirt and tugs up so that he&rsquo;s barely brushing the ground with his toes. Tony might be smaller than all the other third-years, but he&rsquo;s spent twice as long in the workshops moving part after part and hammering piece after piece. He knows exactly how strong he can be when he tries, and lifting a hundred pound brat off the floor is nothing. Especially not when he&rsquo;s feeling like this. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t like me if I have to repeat myself.&rdquo; he says in a deceptively calm voice.</p><p>The boy gulps and Tony can see that fake bravado chip away. <i>Good</i>, he thinks. The boy slaps at his hands, glaring, &ldquo;Okay, okay let me go you freak. God.&rdquo; He rips away from Tony&rsquo;s grip, gesturing to his friends and they run off. </p><p>Tony watches as they go, &ldquo;You pick on this kid or anyone else and you&rsquo;ll regret it, you hear me!&rdquo; if the boys hear him, they make no sound of it. </p><p>But Tony knows they did.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s enough. </p><p>The little boy is still on the ground when Tony turns around, staring up, not in fear anymore, but in a childish wide-eye that plummets him. Something strange takes over him, maybe he&rsquo;s channeling Jarvis. Trying to do his memory proud. But Tony bends down, gives him half a smile. &ldquo;Hey kid, you good?&rdquo;</p><p>Shyly, the kid nods, looking up at him with wet, uncertain eyes. He&rsquo;s got some scratches on his knees and dirt on his arms and hands where he&rsquo;s been tossed into the ground. That couldn&rsquo;t be fun. Tony sighs, giving him a stern look. &ldquo;Stay here okay? I&rsquo;m going to grab some stuff to clean you up.&rdquo; </p><p>The kid just stares at him but when Tony glances back, he&rsquo;s standing obediently still. Tony slides a fiver to the hotdog guy, grabs two bottles of water and a bunch of napkins and returns, offering them to the kid. Except he just stares blankly at him and Tony has to unscrew the bottles himself, sprinkling a bit onto the napkins. &ldquo;This should get the dirt off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh yeah. Thank you&hellip;&rdquo; he murmurs, taking the napkins and wiping steadily at his knees. </p><p>And okay, the kid&rsquo;s trying his best but he&rsquo;s really just&hellip;ineffective. And Tony drops to the floor, gesturing for the kid to join him as he takes the remaining napkins himself, dabbing at his face and elbows. &ldquo;You gotta scrub a little harder. Really work the grime off.&rdquo; Tony remarks, trying to ignore the kid&rsquo;s shy half stares. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;okay, I can do it now. I&rsquo;m not a baby anymore.&rdquo; he says authoritatively, holding out his hand.</p><p>Tony pauses, squinting his eyes and then glancing all around him as though suddenly remembering children shouldn&rsquo;t be unsupervised. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you like, five? Where are your parents?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not five,&rdquo; he asserts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seven and a half.&rdquo; he says proudly. </p><p>Like Tony really knew the difference between a five and a seven year old. There&rsquo;s something warm in his placating stare though and the kid seems to pick up on it from how he perks up a little. &ldquo;Okay so you&rsquo;re seven. Incredible. Pretty sure you still need parents though.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter shrugs, picking at the grass. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have parents. Uncle Ben said they died in a plane. So I live with him now. And Aunt May. But they have work so I&rsquo;m supposed to be with Carly. But she lost me.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony gapes. Not really knowing where to go from all that. Kids are just- so freaking weird. They have no real concept of anything. Don&rsquo;t know anything about social etiquette or TMI or like, needing to have at least a level four friendship to unlock each other&rsquo;s tragic backstories. </p><p>Tony lets his knees fall from under him, sitting properly across from the kid who&rsquo;s still plucking at the greenery like it had personally offended him. &ldquo;This Carly, she your baby-sitter?&rdquo; </p><p>He looks up finally, giving him a sad look. &ldquo;Yeah. But I don&rsquo;t think she likes me very much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s dumb.&rdquo; Tony says, like he was commenting on something obvious like the sun in their faces. </p><p>He&rsquo;s surprised.</p><p>At himself.</p><p>Which is&hellip;also weird.</p><p>The kid looks surprised too. But cutely so. He ducks his head, shy. &ldquo;So she lost you? She left you? By yourself??&rdquo; and Tony kinda hates this Carly chick, whoever the hell she is.</p><p>The kid&rsquo;s all bruised up and probably just went through his least traumatic, but still traumatic life experience, because she decided to what, gab with her stupid boyfriend or something? And the kid&rsquo;s looking all flustered and apologetic. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I stayed where she told me to stay but then she left to get something from the store and then she didn&rsquo;t come back but I moved a little so maybe it&rsquo;s my fault but then I got lost and then those boys found me and they were being mean to me and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do but then you saved me!&rdquo; and he looks so endeared, like what Tony did was something amazing, utterly incredible. </p><p>He looks like a goddamn chipmunk with absurdly cute cartoon eyes. Or something. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; Tony mumbles but the kid shakes his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Whaaat? You were so cool! You were like hey! And then you said a bad word but it&rsquo;s okay because they were mean and sometimes Ben says bad words to bad guys too and then you were like go away! And they were like no! And then you got all scary but in a cool way and then they ran!&rdquo; And his hands are flying all over the place as he retells the moment and he looks so excited, so <i>involved,</i> that Tony almost believes he was as cool as the kid thinks.</p><p>&ldquo;Well they were being giant wastes of space, so.&rdquo; Tony shrugs, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel that bad about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony looks around again, at all the kids with their parents and looks back at the chipmunk. &ldquo;You got a name kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter! Peter Benjamin Parker!&rdquo; he grins.</p><p>And Tony really doesn&rsquo;t know why he does it, but he sticks out his hand and says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tony.&rdquo; </p><p>And Peter stares at his hand for a few seconds before reaching out to shake it, his hand so small in Tony&rsquo;s own.</p><p>&ldquo;Well lest I be accused of kidnapping, we should probably get you back with your baby sitter.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter deflates a little, letting out a little &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony ignores how cute that is. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you know her number or anything?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stares blankly. &ldquo;How about your aunt? Or your uncle?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter chews on his lip, thinking very intently, his nose all scrunched up. &ldquo;Umm I think&hellip;there was definitely a five-four-five and umm&hellip;maybe a two?&rdquo; his face falls, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Mr. Tony, I was supposed to memorize their numbers a long time ago but I keep forgetting them.&rdquo; he looks down, like he&rsquo;s expecting to be reprimanded but Tony just ruffles his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seventeen and I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what the first number of either of my parents&rsquo; numbers are. Don&rsquo;t sweat it.&rdquo; </p><p>But the fact remained, he still had a kid he needed to get home somehow without really all that much to go on. &ldquo;What about your aunt and uncle&rsquo;s work. What do they do?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lights up and Tony sees the pride and admiration he has in his eyes so clearly it hurts. &ldquo;Ben is so cool! He&rsquo;s a cop and he finds bad guys and he&rsquo;s like, a superhero.&rdquo; Peter says, very seriously, &ldquo;And May is a nurse! She saves people&rsquo;s <i>lives</i>.&rdquo; And he looks very intent. Very serious. </p><p>Tony smiles, &ldquo;Wow. They sound like very important people.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods fiercely. &ldquo;Very very important.&rdquo;</p><p>So Tony weighs his options. Call the cops and then get arrested probably. Or try his luck with nearby hospitals. He clicks tongue. Well <i>that&rsquo;s</i> a no-brainer. &ldquo;Do you know which hospital your aunt works at Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Umm&hellip;the mountain one!&rdquo;</p><p>The&hellip;the <i>what</i>?? But then Tony thinks about it and he can&rsquo;t help but snort. Mount Sinai. Twenty minutes from here. He looks at Peter again, at that overly endearing, try hard face and resists the urge to ruffle his hair again. <i>The mountain one</i>. </p><p>Jeez, that&rsquo;s cute.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, sit tight kid, I&rsquo;ll get you home.&rdquo; But he&rsquo;s looking so beat up and Tony kinda hates that he came to the park just to get bullied so he pulls out his wallet and hands him a twenty dollar bill. &ldquo;See that ice cream cart over there? Go get yourself something while I call your aunt. You deserve it for helping me stick it to those assholes.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes go wide at the money. &ldquo;Really?? I can get any kind??&rdquo; </p><p>Tony snorts, &ldquo;Knock yourself out kid. Just don&rsquo;t leave my sight. Can&rsquo;t have you lost twice in one day can we?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, extremely serious, and carefully folds the bill into his hand where it&rsquo;s clenched tightly. Tony googles the hospital number, waiting for the receptionist to pick up. &ldquo;Hi can I speak to May Parker? It&rsquo;s about her nephew, Peter.&rdquo; </p><p>The receptionist, nice girl, manages to snag May from wherever she was pretty quickly. &ldquo;Is this May?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, who is this?&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s not rude necessarily, but she&rsquo;s definitely bordering on I&rsquo;m gonna lose it unless I know exactly what&rsquo;s going on in ten seconds and Tony&rsquo;s kinda surprised she hired someone like Carly to look after her kid. </p><p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Tony Stark and I found your nephew Peter being bullied by some kids in the park. I got rid of the little idiots but when I tried to bring him back to his parents he said he was with his baby sitter, Carly? And that she had left him alone and he got lost. And he doesn&rsquo;t know her number but he knows where you work so&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>It sounds like she&rsquo;s hyperventilating on the other line. &ldquo;Oh my god. Oh my god is he- is Peter <i>okay</i>? Jesus what the- what the fuck. She lost my kid? She <i>lost</i> <i>Peter</i>?!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Parker he&rsquo;s okay. Scout&rsquo;s honor. He&rsquo;s buying ice cream from the cart right now. I can keep you on the line if you want to talk to him-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Please. I need to- yes. And thank you.&rdquo; she says suddenly, like she&rsquo;s just remembering something, &ldquo;For calling me. I don&rsquo;t know what I would do if- if-&rdquo; she breaks off and Tony knows in that moment that May is a good guardian. That she loves Peter. Tremendously. Truly. Epically. </p><p>And he&rsquo;s grateful too suddenly. That he&rsquo;s the one who found him. </p><p>&ldquo;I can bring him to the hospital. If you want.&rdquo; he offers and it&rsquo;s so uncharacteristic of him but so was every other fucking thing so far, so why not this.</p><p>She pauses and Tony can tell she&rsquo;s conflicted over how far her trust of a stranger goes. &ldquo;Mount Sinai, that&rsquo;s just a bus ride away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; she finally says. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t afford to leave my shift but I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him to you in twenty minutes tops.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter is bounding over, holding two sealed popsicles in his hands, a wide smile on his face. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Peter now,&rdquo; he holds out the phone, &ldquo;Hey kid, wanna talk to your aunt?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s expression falls, &ldquo;Is she mad?&rdquo; he whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;Not at you. She&rsquo;s worried about you though.&rdquo; And that triggers the kid&rsquo;s pure little heart and he trades the popsicles for the phone, holding it tight. </p><p>&ldquo;May don&rsquo;t be worried. I&rsquo;m okay! Mr. Tony saved me!&rdquo; </p><p>And shit, Tony wants to just- he doesn&rsquo;t even know- melt or something??<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know where she went. I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to lose her.&rdquo; But May must have set him straight on whose fault it all really was because Peter looks cowed, pulling absently at his curls. &ldquo;Okay. Yes. Mr. Tony&rsquo;s taking me? Okay. Okay, bye May. See you soon. Love you lots too.&rdquo; </p><p>He says it with so much ease. Like saying and hearing I love you&rsquo;s was just as normal as breathing. Tony thinks it&rsquo;s probably just as necessary. We just never knew we were suffocating until it was too late. </p><p>Kids are weird. He knows that. But kids are also&hellip;well they&rsquo;re better than us aren&rsquo;t they? In a lot of ways. Better at expression and kindness and a genuine open-heartedness that the world hasn&rsquo;t stifled yet. Peter turns to him, holds out his phone. &ldquo;Trada ya.&rdquo; he says, with a toothy grin and Tony can&rsquo;t remember the last time he was that unabashedly joyful.</p><p>Tony passes over both popsicles and Peter frowns. &ldquo;That one&rsquo;s for you!&rdquo; he says insistently, pushing one of the popsicles back.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s surprised, just kinda staring. &ldquo;Eating ice cream&rsquo;s no fun alone. But I didn&rsquo;t know if you liked chocolate or vanilla so I just bought us strawberry popsicles because everyone loves popsicles.&rdquo; he says matter of factly. </p><p>&ldquo;Open it, open it!&rdquo; Peter chants and Tony peels back the plastic to reveal an artificially pink icy mess that is somehow the most appealing dessert he&rsquo;s ever seen. </p><p>&ldquo;Are we going to go to May&rsquo;s now?&rdquo; Peter asks, lips stained pink already. </p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah. Yeah, let&rsquo;s go kid. We can still catch the ten.&rdquo; And like it&rsquo;s just habit, Peter holds up his hand, not even looking at him, and Tony feels something inexplicable inside him. </p><p>It hits him in that moment, that he&rsquo;s never held a baby. Seventeen years old and he&rsquo;s never cradled a newborn. Or smelled that weird newborn smell everyone raved about. He&rsquo;s never piggy-backed a toddler or lifted them high in the air. He&rsquo;s never chased a four year old around the kitchen as they shrieked. He&rsquo;s never walked a child down the street. </p><p>But Peter holds up his hand like he&rsquo;s absolutely confident that Tony is the responsible kind of adult that will look both ways and make sure the walk sign flashes. He holds up his hand like Tony is a grown up, someone to rely on. Like Tony is someone he can trust. </p><p>And it&rsquo;s silly. It really isn&rsquo;t that deep. But on a level Peter doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge yet, he believes in Tony and believes he will get him to where he needs to go and <i>of cour</i>se Tony will be able to accomplish this task because he is an <i>adult</i> and he <i>saved </i>him from bullies so <i>of course</i> Tony can do anything. He doesn&rsquo;t know about all the failures and his father and his mountain of regrets. </p><p>It&rsquo;s the most refreshing thing Tony&rsquo;s ever felt. </p><p>He takes Peter&rsquo;s hand and Peter swings it casually as they walk. And Tony licks his popsicle and feels ridiculously domestic. And weird. And it&rsquo;s such an out of body experience, he doesn&rsquo;t even believe it&rsquo;s him. That it&rsquo;s his life he&rsquo;s living right now. </p><p>The bus is rickety and old like everything else in the city, but Peter seems perfectly content just staring out the window. He finishes the last of his popsicle, staring sadly at the stick before sighing melodramatically. He holds out his hand, staring pointedly at Tony&rsquo;s own. Unsure where this was all going, Tony hands it to him and watches as he maneuvers the delicate balancing game of walking down the aisle, throwing the sticks into the trashcan. Whatever May and Ben Parker did to raise that kid, it was all right. </p><p>Damn.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have a job too?&rdquo; Peter asks randomly, tearing his eyes away from a particularly bright billboard to stare at Tony. </p><p>&ldquo;Nah. I go to school here. MIT.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes go wide. &ldquo;OOHHHH that&rsquo;s so cool! I wanna go to MIT too!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s lips quirk up, &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I wanna build super cool robots that can like, do all my chores for me because sometimes I wanna help May but I also wanna play with my Lego and I get so distracted that I keep playing and then May gets disappointed at me and that makes me sad.&rdquo; </p><p>He looks glum for all of two seconds before his giddiness bursts through again, &ldquo;But! If I make a robot, then it can do all our chores and then we can all play Lego together.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That sounds like a pretty solid plan squirt. You definitely belong at MIT.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you built robots?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Super cool ones.&rdquo; Tony confirms.</p><p>If possible, Peter&rsquo;s eyes go wider and Tony <i>swears</i> he sees stars in there. And it strikes him, in that very second, that Peter makes him feel like he&rsquo;s just the coolest person on the planet. Like he&rsquo;s valuable beyond compare, wise beyond his years, limitless and undefeatable. And it&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s just so different. So fundamentally, utterly different than every other way he&rsquo;s been looked at before in his whole life and in a sickening turn of events he feels something close to insanely emotional bubble up inside him.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s practically bouncing in his seat, gripping Tony&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Like what! Like what!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, if you want.&rdquo; Tony pulls out his phone, scrolling through until he finds what he needs. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a test video, of DUM-E being operational for the first time. In his entire life, it&rsquo;s probably the first moment Tony ever felt truly proud of something. Something he did entirely on his own for his own reasons and something that turned out fucking wonderful no matter what anyone else said. </p><p>Peter is in awe the whole time, his fingers clutching Tony&rsquo;s shirt tighter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool.&rdquo; he breathes, &ldquo;Wow. WOOWWW. You&rsquo;re like, a real robot scientist! An umm- umm inventor! Yeah! Like Belle&rsquo;s dad.&rdquo; he glances up, &ldquo;You know, like in Beauty and the Beast?&rdquo; and Tony just nods weakly, trying not to laugh, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool Mr. Tony! When I grow up, I wanna be like you!&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes widen, caught off guard. He coughs, sliding to the next video to distract Peter from his early mid-life crisis but in a good way? He doesn&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s happening with him right now. He&rsquo;s just- he&rsquo;s just overwhelmed. No one&rsquo;s&hellip;no one&rsquo;s ever said that before. No one&rsquo;s ever even implied he could be worth aspiring to. </p><p>His father&rsquo;s words echo in his head and Tony can&rsquo;t help but feel a huge surge of <i>fuck you </i>because what did he know? What did Howard know about anything? When had he inspired anyone to do anything except out of fear. Useless, disappointing, never amounting to anything. What did those words mean, in the face of this shameless admiration from a kid who just saw a robot and thought wow that&rsquo;s cool, let alone having any awareness of the breakthrough that it was and the complexity of everything right down to the name. </p><p>Yeah. DUM-E is cool. Super fucking cool. And he is <i>Tony&rsquo;s </i>and Tony has a million and one more ideas and he is a goddamn <i>inventor</i>. </p><p>The mechanical voice announces their stop and Tony pulls the yellow string. &ldquo;This is us kid. Maybe I&rsquo;ll show you the rest later.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks disappointed, but hands back Tony&rsquo;s phone quickly enough, standing close next to him as they wait at the back doors. It&rsquo;s kinda cute, the kid pressing himself against his leg to avoid all the strangers clustered around them. The doors finally open and Tony keeps a hand on Peter&rsquo;s shoulder as they exit with the rush. He&rsquo;s pretty confident he knows the way to the hospital from here and the two of them walk in companiable silence broken only by Peter&rsquo;s commentary about the passing shops and restaurants.</p><p>&ldquo;And that one over there sells the best hot chocolate in the whole city!&rdquo; Peter declares, pointing energetically at a little hole in the wall.</p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t remember the last time he had hot chocolate. Or anything that wasn&rsquo;t just a straight up coffee for that matter. But he smiles, looking deep in thought. &ldquo;Wow. The best huh? That&rsquo;s a pretty big prize, you sure you did your research.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods, looking extremely certain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. They give you whipped cream without making you pay extra and they put exactly four mini marshmallows and that&rsquo;s the perfect amount.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo; Tony says, trying not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo; Peter copies, looking delighted at the word. </p><p>When Tony enters the hospital, there&rsquo;s a beautiful woman, mid-thirties probably, with long brown hair and a cute upturned nose pacing in circles in the lobby. &ldquo;May!&rdquo; Peter cries, throwing himself in her direction.</p><p>The woman- May, Tony supposes- turns around, face lighting up in pure relief as she crouches down to squeeze him against her chest. &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she cries, face buried in his hair.</p><p>Tony stands behind awkwardly, fingers running through his hair in the absence of anything better to do. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; May says, pulling away to inspect him closely. </p><p>Satisfied that he was alright, she looks up, locks eyes with Tony and just scrutinizes him for what feels like a very long fifteen seconds. She stands, Peter trailing after her as she takes Tony&rsquo;s hand and squeezes. &ldquo;Thank you. For finding him.&rdquo; Her sincerity makes something choke inside him. </p><p>But Tony is nothing if not great at brushing past feelings that threatened to hold him back and he stretches his lips into a lazy half-smile. &ldquo;No need to thank me. Taking down jerks with big egos is a hobby of mine.&rdquo; </p><p>May quirks a lip before scowling. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe Carly would do that. Of all the stupidly irresponsible things. Anything could have happened if you hadn&rsquo;t been there. Or worse- if someone else had-&rdquo; she stops, looks down at Peter and just brushing her fingers through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;I&rsquo;d recommend getting a new one.&rdquo; Tony says and May&rsquo;s expression falls.</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea how long it took me to find <i>this</i> one. You&rsquo;d think in a city crawling with college kids it&rsquo;d be easier to find someone but <i>nooo</i>.&rdquo; she sighs, gives him a tired smile, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you want to.&rdquo; she jokes. </p><p>Peter practically explodes. He grabs onto May&rsquo;s leg, jumping so fasts Tony&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s going to give himself vertigo, &ldquo;May <i>please</i>!!! Mr. Tony&rsquo;s so cool! He builds robots! He showed me on the bus and he just <i>talks </i>to it and then it <i>moves</i>. Isn&rsquo;t that so cool!!&rdquo; </p><p>May stumbles from his weight on her leg, laughing slightly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really cool Peter, but I don&rsquo;t think Tony can do that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually-&rdquo; Tony cuts off, actually <i>what?</i></p><p>But Peter&rsquo;s looking at him with those wide excited eyes and Tony feels <i>adored</i> for the first time in his life. Like he was some kind of superhero or something. And he thinks back to his dad and every single syllable that tore right through him and buried themselves in his heart so all the red turned black and bitter. And he thinks about how happy he was, in a weird, tired sort of way, bringing the kid all the way here. And how cool it would be to teach a kid something and then watch them grow with it and use it and change it and make it better. How incredible it is to watch someone grow. </p><p>And he said hadn&rsquo;t he? That he was craving something different. </p><p>&ldquo;I could&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never baby-sat before. And I know you just met me. But I can get you references and a criminal record check. And I can tutor him- I study engineering at MIT. I can even bring him in to see the labs, maybe he can mess around a bit in there too.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter gasps so hard his hands fly to his mouth. </p><p>May takes a look at Peter, then back at Tony. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s a really nice offer. But I don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You could get to know me.&rdquo; Tony offers, shrugging in that shy way he did in the few times he was ever actually uncomfortable. </p><p>May peers into his eyes like she&rsquo;s trying to read his soul and slowly, a smile blooms. &ldquo;Alright Tony. Let&rsquo;s go get to know you.&rdquo; </p><p>Trying not to look taken aback, he follows her as she starts walking, &ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously. There&rsquo;s something about you&hellip;&rdquo; she smiles, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anything for sure yet, but I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>One Month Later</p><p>Tony pulls up at the Kiss and Ride in a shiny convertible, sunglasses reflecting the light as he ignores all the staring moms. The bell rings and a rush of students storm out the doors, ushered by concerned teachers and supervisors. Peter comes bursting through, smiling wide when he sees him. &ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; he yells, throwing open the car door. </p><p>&ldquo;Easy there squirt, you&rsquo;re gonna blow a gasket.&rdquo; Tony laughs, watching to make sure Peter clicked his seat belt in properly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sunglasses please!&rdquo; Peter sings and Tony hands him a second matching pair that he eagerly slips on. </p><p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; Tony asks, already shifting gears.</p><p>&ldquo;Time to fly!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony parks at the Parker&rsquo;s guest lot, using the house key in Peter&rsquo;s backpack to let themselves in. Peter throws his bag on the floor, running into his bedroom before Tony holds up a hand. &ldquo;Cease and desist.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s socks skid as he stops. &ldquo;Homework first.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter turns around, pout forming, mouth open to whine before Tony beats him to it. &ldquo;Homework and then we can work on the thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter lights up, &ldquo;You promise? Because you said that last time but then you spent all our time trying to make dinner.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Excuse you. I <i>provided</i>. I was being a <i>provider</i>.&rdquo; Tony retorts, offended.</p><p>&ldquo;We could&rsquo;ve just bought pizza!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One day you&rsquo;re going to understand what the true college experience is and be just as sick of pizza as I am.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never growing up!&rdquo; Peter yells, zooming into his bedroom to get his notebook.</p><p>&ldquo;I regret showing you Peter Pan.&rdquo; </p><p>But Tony smiles anyway, setting up the kitchen table with the stuff in Peter&rsquo;s schoolbag. For the most part, Peter never really needed any help. And it was never even a lot, which made sense considering he was only in the second grade, but still. Routines were good for kids. Apparently. At least that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d been told anyway. </p><p>Peter makes a dent on some worksheets while Tony whirls through his coding assignment. They work in a nice quiet, interrupted only by Peter closing his duo-tang up and pushing back his chair so he could peer behind Tony&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so colourful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s code. It&rsquo;s like instructions to make a computer do stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s mouth forms an oh as he tries to take in everything that&rsquo;s happening. &ldquo;So what are you trying to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well me, nothing. The assignment is to find the flaw.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s weird.&rdquo; Peter wrinkles his nose. </p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it kid.&rdquo; And Tony pushes his laptop shut before whirling around and grabbing Peter from his perch, spinning him around.</p><p>Peter shrieks with laughter as Tony dances him across to the living room before tossing him on the couch. &ldquo;Again! Again! Again!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Pete, I&rsquo;m too tired, too old&hellip;&rdquo; Tony says regretfully, dramatically frowning with a woe is me hand placed ever so carefully over his forehead. </p><p>Peter looks crestfallen, looking like he&rsquo;s about to give in when Tony dives for him again, spinning him around and then launching him onto the cushions. Peter screams, raising his arms to go again. Tony throws him onto the couch until he literally can&rsquo;t move his arms anymore and he collapses next to Peter. &ldquo;Hey, you can&rsquo;t be tired yet. We have to do the thing!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Are all children tyrants, or is it just you?&rdquo; Tony teases, pinching Peter&rsquo;s cheek as he puffs them up. </p><p>Peter pushes against Tony&rsquo;s shoulder, but he&rsquo;s so light it hardly makes a difference. &ldquo;Tonyyyy, Tony, Tony, To-nyyyy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Peeeter, Peter, Petey-pie, Peter Pan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Peter grins, plopping one little hand atop of Tony&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cheating.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grins from behind Peter&rsquo;s fingers. &ldquo;Mmm smmsm mm.&rdquo; he dramatically mumbles and Peter pulls his hand away laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;Ok fine. Grab my phone, put the playlist on, let&rsquo;s do this.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter cheers, high-tailing it off the couch to race to the table, plucking Tony&rsquo;s phone deftly while Tony went into the closet to pull out their project. As the child appropriate rock music burst in the apartment, Peter beams as Tony unveils the Death Star Lego set. It&rsquo;s five hundred pieces, way more than Peter could ever do on his own, but still less than the one thousand one he saw and Peter had never been more excited to do anything ever in his <i>life</i>. </p><p>Unfortunately for him, he struggled with picturing all the tiny pieces coalescing into one whole. Enter Tony. He carefully takes out their well organized pieces in their little plastic bags from the box and sets out their base. &ldquo;Okay padawan, shall we begin?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter claps his hands. </p><p>Tony guides Peter through the process, never quite doing it himself, and always giving Peter the opportunity to try his own strategy first. Tony thought it would be tedious, when May first suggested he help the kid out, but there was something so ridiculously gratifying when the light shone in Peter&rsquo;s eyes when he clicked the right pieces together and the excitement that grew the higher up they built. Tony imagines what his life would have been like if his father had been the one to teach him these things, teach him what he knew about mechanics and innovation and engineering instead of Tony figuring it out all on his own. </p><p>Peter sticks out his tongue when he works, scrutinizing the pieces in his hands. He has to catch himself from looking too fond as he stares. Howard couldn&rsquo;t have loved him, Tony thinks, if he had willingly missed out on this feeling. To watch a child navigate the world and triumph in their little parts of it is humbling in a way. Made Tony feel smaller. Like the world had shrunk and his problems with it. </p><p>At first, he had no idea what to expect when May had called him asking him to come on as a baby-sitter. He thought it would be tiring and fun and something to piss off his dad with. Except that, from the second he walked into the apartment, he got swept up in a life far away from his own and everything seemed unimportant here. He wasn&rsquo;t worried about kicking Stanford&rsquo;s ass at the robotics competition, or the midterms he had coming up, or the way Howard talked to him. Kids are demanding. They have needs and wants and can only ever accomplish 40% of them without an adult and Tony finds himself swept away, part of Peter&rsquo;s world. </p><p>And he likes it there.</p><p>Tony gets up, ruffles Peter&rsquo;s hair as he goes. Peter grins up goofily at him, humming to himself as he turns back to his toy. Tony heads into the kitchen, boils some water, sets out two mugs. He mixes in a generous spoonful of Rolo Hot Chocolate Mix, adds exactly four marshmallows and swirls some whipped cream on top. </p><p>&ldquo;Drink break?&rdquo; Tony asks as Peter cheers.</p><p>They sit on the floor together, leaning against the couch as they take small sips from their cups. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you found me in the park.&rdquo; Peter randomly says, a little whipped cream mustache on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You got a little something on your face bud,&rdquo; Tony points at his mouth and Peter struggles to lick everything off, &ldquo;But yeah I guess I&rsquo;m sorta happy with how it all turned out.&rdquo; He teases.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Hey</i>.&rdquo; Peter tries to glare but it comes out all wrong and it&rsquo;s so adorable Tony kinda wants to smack himself, &ldquo;May says if you don&rsquo;t have anything nice to say then you shouldn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wise woman.&rdquo; Tony agrees.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I actually have something nice to say. Do you wanna hear it?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony turns to him, giving him his full, unadulterated attention, batting his eyes comically. Peter&rsquo;s lip quirks up. &ldquo;Oh wait. I made something to say with this. Wait here Tony!&rdquo; he commands as though Tony could really go anywhere else.</p><p>Peter slams his room door shut and Tony can hear him fiddling around before he pokes his head out, &ldquo;Close your eyes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Close my <i>what</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your eyes!!&rdquo; he gestures emphatically at his own and Tony gives him a skeptical look but relents. </p><p>He hears Peter get closer, trying to mask an excited giggle. &ldquo;Okay, you can open your eyes now.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s eyes open and his heart hiccups. Peter&rsquo;s giving him the biggest, cheesiest grin as he thrusts out a sloppily painted mug. It&rsquo;s white, except Peter&rsquo;s painted it all red in mismatched lines and in gold slanted writing, World&rsquo;s Funnest Baby-Sitter. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart bursts and he just knows that there is nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t ever do for Peter. </p><p>Tony would take a bullet for him. </p><p>He would beat the shit out of a million bullies for him.</p><p>He&rsquo;d build him a <i>real</i> Death Star if that would make him happy. </p><p>He takes the cup and hopes his hands don&rsquo;t tremble. He&rsquo;s never felt an endearment like this. He&rsquo;s never had an adoration this sweet and untainted by him. He grips it tight, examines it all over. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist <i>and</i> inventor? That&rsquo;s just not fair.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter clasps his hands behind his back. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you like it? May helped me make it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna drink from it every day.&rdquo; Tony promises.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s eyes glitter. &ldquo;Even in the lab??&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Especially</i> in the lab.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cool!!&rdquo; </p><p>And then Peter falls into his chest, arms looping around his neck. And Tony just stares wide-eyed before slowly, his arms wrap around him too. He hugs Peter tightly. Closes his eyes. In Peter&rsquo;s world, Tony is necessary and needed and capable. In Peter&rsquo;s world he is admired and loved and inspiring in a way Tony never thought possible. He is Tony Stark, kid genius, engineering prodigy, inheritor of the Stark legacy. But kids are weird. And taking care of kids is weirder. Because the title he likes best is cupped tightly in his hands and the person he most likes being is who he is, right here, holding the world. &nbsp;</p></p>",

Truly Hallmark worthy.&rdquo; Tony snipes, his hand shaking as he clicks the phone shut. </p>\n<p>His jaw can&rsquo;t unclench. He&rsquo;s so sick of this. He&rsquo;s so- he&rsquo;s so tired. He&rsquo;s exhausted from the back and forth and the constant circle their lives had become. His phone slides into his back pocket, he looks around. He doesn&rsquo;t- he doesn&rsquo;t even know where he <i>is</i>. He&rsquo;s somewhere off campus- obviously. He&rsquo;s sure his dorm is around here <i>somewhere</i>. But honestly, he really isn&rsquo;t all that inclined to look and he doesn&rsquo;t want to go back to his room and see Rhodey&rsquo;s empathetic eyes and he doesn&rsquo;t want to sit in the library and ruminate and he sure as hell doesn&rsquo;t want to be in the common room listening as everyone in the world enjoys their life more than he ever could. </p>\n<p>So he walks. </p>\n<p>And just&hellip;keeps walking. </p>\n<p>And what the hell? He&rsquo;s seventeen, in his third year (he could&rsquo;ve graduated by now but a secret, small, totally repressed part of him wanted to slide his tassel with Rhodey beside him), completely ignoring his plethora of assignments and therefore has nothing better to be doing than walking aimlessly in Cambridge on what technically is a nice autumn day. Yeah&hellip;the trees are orange. A bit red. Some are yellow. There are some nice piles growing on the sidewalks, some birds flying south in an asymmetrical V. Yup. It&rsquo;s all so overly pleasantly pretty and just gosh darn it wonderful.</p>\n<p>Tony fucking hates it.</p>\n<p>He loves MIT and he loves Rhodey and he loves building every day in the workshop but God he hates his life. Or maybe he doesn&rsquo;t hate it. He&rsquo;s just so tired. <i>All the time</i>. And there&rsquo;s nothing new and there&rsquo;s nothing- nothing moving him forward he&rsquo;s just- he&rsquo;s stagnant. He&rsquo;s just still. Trapped. Caught. And he can&rsquo;t do it anymore he just can&rsquo;t. And maybe it&rsquo;s his dad- God it&rsquo;s always his dad- but he&rsquo;s sick of always being kicked by the same old shit and he&rsquo;s sick of doing everything his dad wants and and he&rsquo;s sick of doing what everyone <i>else</i> wants and yeah Tony Stark has never bowed down to anybody, but can he honestly say he chose any of this? This is <i>his life</i>- why the fuck isn&rsquo;t he happy? </p>\n<p>Tony kicks a pebble. It stutters across the sidewalk then gets blown into the street, run over by a car. Tony blows a harsh breath. <i>Figures</i>. </p>\n</p>",

You and MJ had wide smiles on your faces as you clapped for Liz, who was up front with the honor students and wearing her Salutatorian medal proudly. </p><p>You both ran up to her and squished her in a hug after the ceremony ended, nearly knocking her cap back off while the three of you laughed. Ned and Betty were there too, and you all took pictures with her upon her mom&rsquo;s insistence. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but look around for the only boy that was missing - you&rsquo;d think Peter would show up to his girlfriend&rsquo;s graduation, but you didn&rsquo;t see him at all.</p><!-- more --><p>That was strange. Liz didn&rsquo;t say anything about it and didn&rsquo;t seem upset about it, either, so none of you mentioned it. You almost expected him to appear at dinner when you all went out, but he was still absent, and Liz still didn&rsquo;t seem to act like anything was wrong. He probably had something come up - he was always running late to things and leaving early, or just not showing up. </p><p>The last time you had seen Peter was at the last decathlon meeting, where Mr. Harrington was trying to last minute plan a trip to Europe for the team so you could participate in an international competition.</p><p>It seemed like a fun idea - even though Liz and another senior on the team were graduating, they were also invited to join the group as they were still team members. The trip would be two weeks and the actual competition would be in London, but your teacher managed to plan it so that you could all sightsee in Venice and Prague as well. </p><p>You&rsquo;d always wanted to travel, especially to Italy, and it would be the perfect time to - right before senior year, before the stress of applying to colleges. You had planned on getting an internship next summer and hopefully a job for the ones following, so this was the best time to go on a trip.</p><p>The only downside would be seeing Peter with Liz for those two weeks, when you had hoped the whole summer break you could avoid seeing them at the same time. You had hoped to not see Peter at all, in fact.</p><p>But you were able to put those thoughts on the back burner for the time being. Summer started and you were finally able to relax after finals. You didn&rsquo;t see your friends much for the first few weeks - Ned and Betty went to a family reunion of hers a few states away, and Liz had gone somewhat off the grid after graduation - you figured she was relaxing after finally finishing high school. </p><p>You only saw MJ a handful of times - she started a new internship at an outreach center, and became almost as busy as Peter with his Stark internship. She still made time to see you and check in, though.</p><p>Liz and MJ both had different approaches to how they were going to act around you know that they knew you met your soulmate. Liz seemed to give you space - after you and her talked, she didn&rsquo;t really bother you anymore about it. MJ was almost the opposite. She could tell you didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it still, so she never pushed the subject, but she was always trying to distract you by offering to hang out in her spare time. </p><p>You appreciated that from both of them - seeing Liz was hard now. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that her boyfriend was your soulmate, and you weren&rsquo;t mad at her for that. She didn&rsquo;t know, and even if she did, it was Peter who was at fault for not wanting to be with you, it wasn&rsquo;t her place to take the blame. But you were glad she was giving you space, knowing maybe subconsciously that that was the best thing for you at the moment. Seeing her always made you think of him, and what happened, and then it would just spiral from there.</p><p>Seeing MJ was easier. You knew she was suspicious of who it could be, but she never prodded for an answer, and you were grateful for that. If she found out it was Peter, there would suddenly be a huge split in your friend group, and that was the last thing you wanted.</p><p>Keeping your friends together was more important to you than your feelings for Peter being unrequited.</p><p>But time goes on, and soon enough school ended and you no longer had to worry about your friends finding out about what happened between you and him.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t heard anything from Peter since the end of school, per request that he doesn&rsquo;t contact you, and you were a little relieved about that. Every once in a while you felt some kind of emotion from him, more often than not guilt and regret in response to your ever-frequent pain, which still hadn&rsquo;t gone away since you both stopped talking.</p><p>The last few weeks of school consisted of you both dancing around each other, putting on an act in front of your friends, and not talking when you weren&rsquo;t with them. Peter tried to at first - you knew he did, you could feel a spark of anxiety on his side as he came up to you in the hallway or the library and you were able to escape, not wanting to talk to him. </p><p>That was the last thing you needed, another talk about how to mend your broken friendship. He eventually gave up, just going back to giving you moody looks in class and not bothering to hide his guilty emotions.</p><p>The summer nights were warm and you took to sitting out on your fire escape. You were lucky to have a large one right outside your window, that was even roof accessible so you could sit on the ledge and kick your feet in the air if you wanted.</p><p>There were plenty of books to read for AP Lit next year, so you spent most nights deciding to get through those as quick as possible what with the Europe trip coming up, and sitting outside helped. You somehow didn&rsquo;t get distracted by the noises of Queens, just getting lost in the stories as you leaned back against the brick wall and stretched your feet out through the rail.</p><p>That was what you were doing a few weeks into summer, finally able to relax after the stress of finals. You decided to read the first book on the list, The Catcher in the Rye, which was the shortest of the rest of them. It would probably be an easy start.</p><p>It was late by the time your eyes started drooping and you were getting bored, so you scrolled through Instagram for a while and then snapchat, feeling a little nostalgic and deciding to look through your memories.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>You were chuckling through the first couple - you had some goofy selfies you took with Ned during class when the teacher wasn&rsquo;t looking. The next ones were Liz and MJ posing with mannequins at the mall. There was one video of you and MJ pointing at Betty and Ned sitting together and yelling &ldquo;Is that allowed!&rdquo;</p><p>Going back further showed pictures of you and the decathlon team at finals, finding some selfies that Flash took on your phone when you probably weren&rsquo;t looking, which made you snort. You had a few videos of Abe ringing the bell every time Flash spoke, and some from the bus rides to and from competitions. You could see now the ugly yellow color the jackets were, making you chuckle at how stupid they looked.</p><p>One of them made you stop.</p><p>You remembered when you took the picture. It was of MJ, completely knocked out on the bus. It made you laugh because despite the driver going over every single bump, and all the noise from the team and someone who brought their speaker, she had managed to pass out and sleep the whole ride. </p><p>But now you focused on the background of the picture, which made your heart ache.</p><p>Liz, pretty as ever, sitting on a seat in the back with a wide smile on her face. Peter was leaning forward on the seat across from her, his hands under his chin while he talked to her, with the most adoring look you&rsquo;d ever seen on someone&rsquo;s face. He was staring at her like she was the only person that mattered.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t noticed them in the background of this picture when you took it, and you wished you hadn&rsquo;t now.</p><p>Seeing the look Peter was giving Liz made you feel more crappy than you had for the last several weeks. It took a while for you to get over the hurt (and honestly, you still hadn&rsquo;t gotten over it), but seeing this picture made you feel it even worse, and you felt your eyes sting.</p><p>You thought about Peter pretty much every day. It was lucky that you hadn&rsquo;t seen him since summer started, and it was easier to move on that way. Clearly, the last few weeks didn&rsquo;t do much to help that, though, as you were now crying over a stupid picture that you happened to come across.</p><p>Feeling like this sucked. And was kind of pathetic.</p><p>The thing about the sunburn was that it made your feelings for your soulmate more intense. You had a crush on Peter, you probably had for about a year, but ever since you two touched, your feelings were a lot stronger than that. It was almost unbearable to think about how he didn&rsquo;t feel that way about you. It didn&rsquo;t even make sense, you&rsquo;d never heard of someone not having feelings for their soulmate, even if they met as strangers.</p><p>With a sniff, you wiped your eyes and clicked your phone off, though the picture remained burned in the back of your mind. He was supposed to be looking at <i>you</i> like that. He should&rsquo;ve fallen for you the second your worlds burst into color, and he should definitely not be the one bringing you this much pain.</p><p>Soulmates weren&rsquo;t meant to work like that.</p><p>You barely felt the feeling of nervousness run through your chest, and it made you frown. Why was he feeling nervous? You glanced at your phone and saw that it was nearly half one, and you figured maybe he was just having a weird dream.</p><p>That thought made you want to go to sleep, so you wiped your eyes again and sighed, shutting them and trying to relax a little before you went inside. But you were startled when your fire escape railing jolted and shook, making your eyes snap open to see a red and blue figure crouching a few feet away, stuck to the side of the rail in a way that shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible with gravity.</p><p>But it was Spider-Man, and sticking to things was something he was known for.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said suddenly, his voice sounding extremely deep. You couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a teary laugh at that while he jumped, clearly not expecting it either, &ldquo;What the heck Karen, I said <i>slightly</i> change the tone, not make me sound like Morgan Freeman!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Karen?&rdquo; You asked quietly, wiping your eyes a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh, the A.I. in my suit,&rdquo; his voice sounded a little bit more normal, but it was obviously still altered somehow. &ldquo;She likes to mess with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; you nodded as if you understood, and his mask shifted into what you assumed might be a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So, um, can I ask why you&rsquo;re out here crying at nearly two in the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said I was crying?&rdquo; You tried to joke a little but he just jumped onto your escape and put his hands on his hips, clearly not buying your crap.</p><p>&ldquo;Not to be blunt, but there&rsquo;s literally still tears on your face, and also I definitely saw you a few minutes ago before I jumped down here,&rdquo; he said, and you gave him a look. &ldquo;Hey, just being honest!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, thank you very much,&rdquo; you insisted, not able to help from looking over his suit. The red and blue went well together - before all the pictures you had seen of him were black and white, and it seemed a little funny to you now that seeing him in color for the first time was also the first time you saw him in person.</p><p>&ldquo;You checking me out?&rdquo; He did a little twirl for you, and you bit your lip to keep from laughing at the stupid pose he did.</p><p>&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know your suit was red and blue,&rdquo; you rolled your eyes, hoping he didn&rsquo;t notice you wipe under your eyes some more. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know either,&rdquo; he laughed a little, &ldquo;Not until recently, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled tightly, not able to help the small bit of jealousy you felt at his words. It seemed like everyone around you had a soulmate, even freaking Spider-Man. &ldquo;What colors did you think it was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Orange and green.&rdquo;</p><p>You snorted, &ldquo;That would have been awful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m glad I was wrong,&rdquo; he chuckled, crossing his legs and sitting next to you. &ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;re pretty good at trying to change the subject.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it worked for a minute there.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes squinted at you, looking almost comical. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, we don&rsquo;t have to talk about it yet. I&rsquo;m Spider-Man, by the way.&rdquo;</p><p>He stuck his hand out, making you laugh a little as you shook it, &ldquo;I figured. I&rsquo;m Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty name,&rdquo; he complimented, and you ignored the funny feeling in your chest that came with it. </p><p>&ldquo;Catcher in the Rye, huh?&rdquo; He picked up your book, flicking through it, &ldquo;What part are you at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chapter ten,&rdquo; you scratched your head, &ldquo;I think. I was sort of falling asleep.&rdquo;</p><p>He snorted, handing you the book back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t really blame you on that. Took me two weeks to get through that book, and I was reading it every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Spider-Man secretly a book worm?&rdquo; You teased a little, almost imagining him scrunching his nose up at the way his masked eyes squinted. </p><p>&ldquo;Nah, just had to read it. What about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Also had to read it. AP Lit summer reading list, one of four required books,&rdquo; you sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;AP Lit huh, you must be smart,&rdquo; you rolled your eyes at the compliment, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a bit early to get started on those, didn&rsquo;t most high schools just finish like two weeks ago?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Early bird catches the worm, isn&rsquo;t that the saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a bogus saying,&rdquo; he scoffed, his slightly offended tone making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s usually worked for me. What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>Right away he dived into some rant about how and why that saying was stupid, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but be a little amused at how he waved his hands around while he talked, and despite not being able to see his face it was easy to guess what his expression was while he spoke.</p><p>Talking to Spider-Man at two in the morning was really weird but also felt completely normal. Just like the papers said, he was kind of a wisecrack, but his dumb jokes made you laugh and were good at distracting you from why you were crying earlier.</p><p>But you had a feeling he wasn&rsquo;t just there to talk, so you cut him off after he started talking about another subject.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;And what am I doing?&rdquo; He replied a little cheekily, and you could hear a smile in his voice despite the slightly-off sound to it with the voice changer his AI provided.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to distract me by going on weirdly long rants about stupid common sayings so that I tell you why I was crying. Like, who goes on and on about the early bird saying like that? And somehow manages to change that subject to climate change and then to-to <i>Star Wars</i> from that? You have a serious hero complex, dude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; he muttered, scratching his chin, &ldquo;You know me so well already, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re trying to act like we&rsquo;re friends so that I tell you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he held up his hands, laughing at how you pointed a finger at him in accusation, &ldquo;I told you I secretly like the Prequel movies the best, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that <i>does</i> make us friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really like the Prequel movies the best, do you? I mean, the original trilogy has to be the winner. Or at least the new series, like come on. You were just joking, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well <i>now</i> I&rsquo;m not gonna say so, since you&rsquo;re being Miss Judgy over here - hey wait, now <i>you&rsquo;re</i> changing the subject again!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You got me,&rdquo; you bit your lip to hide a laugh while he huffed, crossing his arms. &ldquo;Honestly, what are you doing? Why do you care so much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just like helping people, maybe I do have a bit of a hero complex,&rdquo; his masked eyes narrowed, facing you again. &ldquo;And you, no offense, looked like you might be in need of some help. Or just someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need help, and I don&rsquo;t need Spider-Man: Part Time Therapist, to try and trick me into talking about my problems, thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Part time therapist, I kinda like that,&rdquo; he mused, making you chuckle, &ldquo;Fine, it&rsquo;s not my business. But talking about things helps a lot more than you might think, and people say I&rsquo;m a good listener.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll take you up on that another time.&rdquo;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t realize how tired you were the whole time you were both talking until you realized the sky was getting lighter. With a curse you grabbed your phone, seeing it was five am.</p><p>&ldquo;You kept me up until sunrise!&rdquo; You complained, ignoring him laughing and holding his stomach at your expression.</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve said you were tired, I would&rsquo;ve left you alone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you would&rsquo;ve,&rdquo; you grabbed your book and old blanket, stuffing it under your arm as you started to feel how tired you actually were. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna sleep until like, two pm now, so thanks for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; he said cheekily, ignoring your dirty look. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, goodnight, then. Or morning, whatever,&rdquo; you muttered, sliding your window open and starting to crawl in, but he put his gloved hand on your shoulder, stopping you briefly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, uh, will you be out here tomorrow?&rdquo; He asked carefully, making you smile a little.</p><p>A weird hopeful feeling went through your emotions, but you chose to ignore it.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>",

Seeing her always made you think of him, and what happened, and then it would just spiral from there.</p><p>Seeing MJ was easier. You knew she was suspicious of who it could be, but she never prodded for an answer, and you were grateful for that. If she found out it was Peter, there would suddenly be a huge split in your friend group, and that was the last thing you wanted.</p><p>Keeping your friends together was more important to you than your feelings for Peter being unrequited.</p><p>But time goes on, and soon enough school ended and you no longer had to worry about your friends finding out about what happened between you and him.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t heard anything from Peter since the end of school, per request that he doesn\u2019t contact you, and you were a little relieved about that. Every once in a while you felt some kind of emotion from him, more often than not guilt and regret in response to your ever-frequent pain, which still hadn\u2019t gone away since you both stopped talking.</p><p>The last few weeks of school consisted of you both dancing around each other, putting on an act in front of your friends, and not talking when you weren\u2019t with them. Peter tried to at first - you knew he did, you could feel a spark of anxiety on his side as he came up to you in the hallway or the library and you were able to escape, not wanting to talk to him. </p><p>That was the last thing you needed, another talk about how to mend your broken friendship. He eventually gave up, just going back to giving you moody looks in class and not bothering to hide his guilty emotions.</p><p>The summer nights were warm and you took to sitting out on your fire escape. You were lucky to have a large one right outside your window, that was even roof accessible so you could sit on the ledge and kick your feet in the air if you wanted.</p><p>There were plenty of books to read for AP Lit next year, so you spent most nights deciding to get through those as quick as possible what with the Europe trip coming up, and sitting outside helped. You somehow didn\u2019t get distracted by the noises of Queens, just getting lost in the stories as you leaned back against the brick wall and stretched your feet out through the rail.</p><p>That was what you were doing a few weeks into summer, finally able to relax after the stress of finals. You decided to read the first book on the list, The Catcher in the Rye, which was the shortest of the rest of them. It would probably be an easy start.</p><p>It was late by the time your eyes started drooping and you were getting bored, so you scrolled through Instagram for a while and then snapchat, feeling a little nostalgic and deciding to look through your memories.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>You were chuckling through the first couple - you had some goofy selfies you took with Ned during class when the teacher wasn\u2019t looking. The next ones were Liz and MJ posing with mannequins at the mall. There was one video of you and MJ pointing at Betty and Ned sitting together and yelling \u201cIs that allowed!\u201d</p><p>Going back further showed pictures of you and the decathlon team at finals, finding some selfies that Flash took on your phone when you probably weren\u2019t looking, which made you snort. You had a few videos of Abe ringing the bell every time Flash spoke, and some from the bus rides to and from competitions. You could see now the ugly yellow color the jackets were, making you chuckle at how stupid they looked.</p><p>One of them made you stop.</p><p>You remembered when you took the picture. It was of MJ, completely knocked out on the bus. It made you laugh because despite the driver going over every single bump, and all the noise from the team and someone who brought their speaker, she had managed to pass out and sleep the whole ride. </p><p>But now you focused on the background of the picture, which made your heart ache.</p><p>Liz, pretty as ever, sitting on a seat in the back with a wide smile on her face. Peter was leaning forward on the seat across from her, his hands under his chin while he talked to her, with the most adoring look you\u2019d ever seen on someone\u2019s face. He was staring at her like she was the only person that mattered.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t noticed them in the background of this picture when you took it, and you wished you hadn\u2019t now.</p><p>Seeing the look Peter was giving Liz made you feel more crappy than you had for the last several weeks. It took a while for you to get over the hurt (and honestly, you still hadn\u2019t gotten over it), but seeing this picture made you feel it even worse, and you felt your eyes sting.</p><p>You thought about Peter pretty much every day. It was lucky that you hadn\u2019t seen him since summer started, and it was easier to move on that way. Clearly, the last few weeks didn\u2019t do much to help that, though, as you were now crying over a stupid picture that you happened to come across.</p><p>Feeling like this sucked. And was kind of pathetic.</p><p>The thing about the sunburn was that it made your feelings for your soulmate more intense. You had a crush on Peter, you probably had for about a year, but ever since you two touched, your feelings were a lot stronger than that. It was almost unbearable to think about how he didn\u2019t feel that way about you. It didn\u2019t even make sense, you\u2019d never heard of someone not having feelings for their soulmate, even if they met as strangers.</p><p>With a sniff, you wiped your eyes and clicked your phone off, though the picture remained burned in the back of your mind. He was supposed to be looking at <i>you</i> like that. He should\u2019ve fallen for you the second your worlds burst into color, and he should definitely not be the one bringing you this much pain.</p><p>Soulmates weren\u2019t meant to work like that.</p><p>You barely felt the feeling of nervousness run through your chest, and it made you frown. Why was he feeling nervous? You glanced at your phone and saw that it was nearly half one, and you figured maybe he was just having a weird dream.</p><p>That thought made you want to go to sleep, so you wiped your eyes again and sighed, shutting them and trying to relax a little before you went inside. But you were startled when your fire escape railing jolted and shook, making your eyes snap open to see a red and blue figure crouching a few feet away, stuck to the side of the rail in a way that shouldn\u2019t have been possible with gravity.</p><p>But it was Spider-Man, and sticking to things was something he was known for.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said suddenly, his voice sounding extremely deep. You couldn\u2019t help but let out a teary laugh at that while he jumped, clearly not expecting it either, \u201cWhat the heck Karen, I said <i>slightly</i> change the tone, not make me sound like Morgan Freeman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren?\u201d You asked quietly, wiping your eyes a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, the A.I. in my suit,\u201d his voice sounded a little bit more normal, but it was obviously still altered somehow. \u201cShe likes to mess with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d you nodded as if you understood, and his mask shifted into what you assumed might be a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, can I ask why you\u2019re out here crying at nearly two in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was crying?\u201d You tried to joke a little but he just jumped onto your escape and put his hands on his hips, clearly not buying your crap.</p><p>\u201cNot to be blunt, but there\u2019s literally still tears on your face, and also I definitely saw you a few minutes ago before I jumped down here,\u201d he said, and you gave him a look. \u201cHey, just being honest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you very much,\u201d you insisted, not able to help from looking over his suit. The red and blue went well together - before all the pictures you had seen of him were black and white, and it seemed a little funny to you now that seeing him in color for the first time was also the first time you saw him in person.</p><p>\u201cYou checking me out?\u201d He did a little twirl for you, and you bit your lip to keep from laughing at the stupid pose he did.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know your suit was red and blue,\u201d you rolled your eyes, hoping he didn\u2019t notice you wipe under your eyes some more. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know either,\u201d he laughed a little, \u201cNot until recently, at least.\u201d</p><p>You smiled tightly, not able to help the small bit of jealousy you felt at his words. It seemed like everyone around you had a soulmate, even freaking Spider-Man. \u201cWhat colors did you think it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrange and green.\u201d</p><p>You snorted, \u201cThat would have been awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad I was wrong,\u201d he chuckled, crossing his legs and sitting next to you. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re pretty good at trying to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it worked for a minute there.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squinted at you, looking almost comical. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we don\u2019t have to talk about it yet. I\u2019m Spider-Man, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his hand out, making you laugh a little as you shook it, \u201cI figured. I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty name,\u201d he complimented, and you ignored the funny feeling in your chest that came with it. </p><p>\u201cCatcher in the Rye, huh?\u201d He picked up your book, flicking through it, \u201cWhat part are you at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChapter ten,\u201d you scratched your head, \u201cI think. I was sort of falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, handing you the book back. \u201cDon\u2019t really blame you on that. Took me two weeks to get through that book, and I was reading it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Spider-Man secretly a book worm?\u201d You teased a little, almost imagining him scrunching his nose up at the way his masked eyes squinted. </p><p>\u201cNah, just had to read it. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso had to read it. AP Lit summer reading list, one of four required books,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cAP Lit huh, you must be smart,\u201d you rolled your eyes at the compliment, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit early to get started on those, didn\u2019t most high schools just finish like two weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly bird catches the worm, isn\u2019t that the saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a bogus saying,\u201d he scoffed, his slightly offended tone making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s usually worked for me. What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Right away he dived into some rant about how and why that saying was stupid, and you couldn\u2019t help but be a little amused at how he waved his hands around while he talked, and despite not being able to see his face it was easy to guess what his expression was while he spoke.</p><p>Talking to Spider-Man at two in the morning was really weird but also felt completely normal. Just like the papers said, he was kind of a wisecrack, but his dumb jokes made you laugh and were good at distracting you from why you were crying earlier.</p><p>But you had a feeling he wasn\u2019t just there to talk, so you cut him off after he started talking about another subject.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what am I doing?\u201d He replied a little cheekily, and you could hear a smile in his voice despite the slightly-off sound to it with the voice changer his AI provided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me by going on weirdly long rants about stupid common sayings so that I tell you why I was crying. Like, who goes on and on about the early bird saying like that? And somehow manages to change that subject to climate change and then to-to <i>Star Wars</i> from that? You have a serious hero complex, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, scratching his chin, \u201cYou know me so well already, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re trying to act like we\u2019re friends so that I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he held up his hands, laughing at how you pointed a finger at him in accusation, \u201cI told you I secretly like the Prequel movies the best, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that <i>does</i> make us friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really like the Prequel movies the best, do you? I mean, the original trilogy has to be the winner. Or at least the new series, like come on. You were just joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell <i>now</i> I\u2019m not gonna say so, since you\u2019re being Miss Judgy over here - hey wait, now <i>you\u2019re</i> changing the subject again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me,\u201d you bit your lip to hide a laugh while he huffed, crossing his arms. \u201cHonestly, what are you doing? Why do you care so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like helping people, maybe I do have a bit of a hero complex,\u201d his masked eyes narrowed, facing you again. \u201cAnd you, no offense, looked like you might be in need of some help. Or just someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help, and I don\u2019t need Spider-Man: Part Time Therapist, to try and trick me into talking about my problems, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart time therapist, I kinda like that,\u201d he mused, making you chuckle, \u201cFine, it\u2019s not my business. But talking about things helps a lot more than you might think, and people say I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you up on that another time.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t realize how tired you were the whole time you were both talking until you realized the sky was getting lighter. With a curse you grabbed your phone, seeing it was five am.</p><p>\u201cYou kept me up until sunrise!\u201d You complained, ignoring him laughing and holding his stomach at your expression.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve said you were tired, I would\u2019ve left you alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you would\u2019ve,\u201d you grabbed your book and old blanket, stuffing it under your arm as you started to feel how tired you actually were. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep until like, two pm now, so thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said cheekily, ignoring your dirty look. </p><p>\u201cOkay, goodnight, then. Or morning, whatever,\u201d you muttered, sliding your window open and starting to crawl in, but he put his gloved hand on your shoulder, stopping you briefly.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, will you be out here tomorrow?\u201d He asked carefully, making you smile a little.</p><p>A weird hopeful feeling went through your emotions, but you chose to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>",

You and MJ had wide smiles on your faces as you clapped for Liz, who was up front with the honor students and wearing her Salutatorian medal proudly. </p><p>You both ran up to her and squished her in a hug after the ceremony ended, nearly knocking her cap back off while the three of you laughed. Ned and Betty were there too, and you all took pictures with her upon her mom\u2019s insistence. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but look around for the only boy that was missing - you\u2019d think Peter would show up to his girlfriend\u2019s graduation, but you didn\u2019t see him at all.</p>[[MORE]]<p>That was strange. Liz didn\u2019t say anything about it and didn\u2019t seem upset about it, either, so none of you mentioned it. You almost expected him to appear at dinner when you all went out, but he was still absent, and Liz still didn\u2019t seem to act like anything was wrong. He probably had something come up - he was always running late to things and leaving early, or just not showing up. </p><p>The last time you had seen Peter was at the last decathlon meeting, where Mr. Harrington was trying to last minute plan a trip to Europe for the team so you could participate in an international competition.</p><p>It seemed like a fun idea - even though Liz and another senior on the team were graduating, they were also invited to join the group as they were still team members. The trip would be two weeks and the actual competition would be in London, but your teacher managed to plan it so that you could all sightsee in Venice and Prague as well. </p><p>You\u2019d always wanted to travel, especially to Italy, and it would be the perfect time to - right before senior year, before the stress of applying to colleges. You had planned on getting an internship next summer and hopefully a job for the ones following, so this was the best time to go on a trip.</p><p>The only downside would be seeing Peter with Liz for those two weeks, when you had hoped the whole summer break you could avoid seeing them at the same time. You had hoped to not see Peter at all, in fact.</p><p>But you were able to put those thoughts on the back burner for the time being. Summer started and you were finally able to relax after finals. You didn\u2019t see your friends much for the first few weeks - Ned and Betty went to a family reunion of hers a few states away, and Liz had gone somewhat off the grid after graduation - you figured she was relaxing after finally finishing high school. </p><p>You only saw MJ a handful of times - she started a new internship at an outreach center, and became almost as busy as Peter with his Stark internship. She still made time to see you and check in, though.</p><p>Liz and MJ both had different approaches to how they were going to act around you know that they knew you met your soulmate. Liz seemed to give you space - after you and her talked, she didn\u2019t really bother you anymore about it. MJ was almost the opposite. She could tell you didn\u2019t want to talk about it still, so she never pushed the subject, but she was always trying to distract you by offering to hang out in her spare time. </p><p>You appreciated that from both of them - seeing Liz was hard now. It wasn\u2019t her fault that her boyfriend was your soulmate, and you weren\u2019t mad at her for that. She didn\u2019t know, and even if she did, it was Peter who was at fault for not wanting to be with you, it wasn\u2019t her place to take the blame. But you were glad she was giving you space, knowing maybe subconsciously that that was the best thing for you at the moment. Seeing her always made you think of him, and what happened, and then it would just spiral from there.</p><p>Seeing MJ was easier. You knew she was suspicious of who it could be, but she never prodded for an answer, and you were grateful for that. If she found out it was Peter, there would suddenly be a huge split in your friend group, and that was the last thing you wanted.</p><p>Keeping your friends together was more important to you than your feelings for Peter being unrequited.</p><p>But time goes on, and soon enough school ended and you no longer had to worry about your friends finding out about what happened between you and him.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t heard anything from Peter since the end of school, per request that he doesn\u2019t contact you, and you were a little relieved about that. Every once in a while you felt some kind of emotion from him, more often than not guilt and regret in response to your ever-frequent pain, which still hadn\u2019t gone away since you both stopped talking.</p><p>The last few weeks of school consisted of you both dancing around each other, putting on an act in front of your friends, and not talking when you weren\u2019t with them. Peter tried to at first - you knew he did, you could feel a spark of anxiety on his side as he came up to you in the hallway or the library and you were able to escape, not wanting to talk to him. </p><p>That was the last thing you needed, another talk about how to mend your broken friendship. He eventually gave up, just going back to giving you moody looks in class and not bothering to hide his guilty emotions.</p><p>The summer nights were warm and you took to sitting out on your fire escape. You were lucky to have a large one right outside your window, that was even roof accessible so you could sit on the ledge and kick your feet in the air if you wanted.</p><p>There were plenty of books to read for AP Lit next year, so you spent most nights deciding to get through those as quick as possible what with the Europe trip coming up, and sitting outside helped. You somehow didn\u2019t get distracted by the noises of Queens, just getting lost in the stories as you leaned back against the brick wall and stretched your feet out through the rail.</p><p>That was what you were doing a few weeks into summer, finally able to relax after the stress of finals. You decided to read the first book on the list, The Catcher in the Rye, which was the shortest of the rest of them. It would probably be an easy start.</p><p>It was late by the time your eyes started drooping and you were getting bored, so you scrolled through Instagram for a while and then snapchat, feeling a little nostalgic and deciding to look through your memories.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>You were chuckling through the first couple - you had some goofy selfies you took with Ned during class when the teacher wasn\u2019t looking. The next ones were Liz and MJ posing with mannequins at the mall. There was one video of you and MJ pointing at Betty and Ned sitting together and yelling \u201cIs that allowed!\u201d</p><p>Going back further showed pictures of you and the decathlon team at finals, finding some selfies that Flash took on your phone when you probably weren\u2019t looking, which made you snort. You had a few videos of Abe ringing the bell every time Flash spoke, and some from the bus rides to and from competitions. You could see now the ugly yellow color the jackets were, making you chuckle at how stupid they looked.</p><p>One of them made you stop.</p><p>You remembered when you took the picture. It was of MJ, completely knocked out on the bus. It made you laugh because despite the driver going over every single bump, and all the noise from the team and someone who brought their speaker, she had managed to pass out and sleep the whole ride. </p><p>But now you focused on the background of the picture, which made your heart ache.</p><p>Liz, pretty as ever, sitting on a seat in the back with a wide smile on her face. Peter was leaning forward on the seat across from her, his hands under his chin while he talked to her, with the most adoring look you\u2019d ever seen on someone\u2019s face. He was staring at her like she was the only person that mattered.</p><p>You hadn\u2019t noticed them in the background of this picture when you took it, and you wished you hadn\u2019t now.</p><p>Seeing the look Peter was giving Liz made you feel more crappy than you had for the last several weeks. It took a while for you to get over the hurt (and honestly, you still hadn\u2019t gotten over it), but seeing this picture made you feel it even worse, and you felt your eyes sting.</p><p>You thought about Peter pretty much every day. It was lucky that you hadn\u2019t seen him since summer started, and it was easier to move on that way. Clearly, the last few weeks didn\u2019t do much to help that, though, as you were now crying over a stupid picture that you happened to come across.</p><p>Feeling like this sucked. And was kind of pathetic.</p><p>The thing about the sunburn was that it made your feelings for your soulmate more intense. You had a crush on Peter, you probably had for about a year, but ever since you two touched, your feelings were a lot stronger than that. It was almost unbearable to think about how he didn\u2019t feel that way about you. It didn\u2019t even make sense, you\u2019d never heard of someone not having feelings for their soulmate, even if they met as strangers.</p><p>With a sniff, you wiped your eyes and clicked your phone off, though the picture remained burned in the back of your mind. He was supposed to be looking at <i>you</i> like that. He should\u2019ve fallen for you the second your worlds burst into color, and he should definitely not be the one bringing you this much pain.</p><p>Soulmates weren\u2019t meant to work like that.</p><p>You barely felt the feeling of nervousness run through your chest, and it made you frown. Why was he feeling nervous? You glanced at your phone and saw that it was nearly half one, and you figured maybe he was just having a weird dream.</p><p>That thought made you want to go to sleep, so you wiped your eyes again and sighed, shutting them and trying to relax a little before you went inside. But you were startled when your fire escape railing jolted and shook, making your eyes snap open to see a red and blue figure crouching a few feet away, stuck to the side of the rail in a way that shouldn\u2019t have been possible with gravity.</p><p>But it was Spider-Man, and sticking to things was something he was known for.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said suddenly, his voice sounding extremely deep. You couldn\u2019t help but let out a teary laugh at that while he jumped, clearly not expecting it either, \u201cWhat the heck Karen, I said <i>slightly</i> change the tone, not make me sound like Morgan Freeman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren?\u201d You asked quietly, wiping your eyes a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, the A.I. in my suit,\u201d his voice sounded a little bit more normal, but it was obviously still altered somehow. \u201cShe likes to mess with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d you nodded as if you understood, and his mask shifted into what you assumed might be a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, can I ask why you\u2019re out here crying at nearly two in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was crying?\u201d You tried to joke a little but he just jumped onto your escape and put his hands on his hips, clearly not buying your crap.</p><p>\u201cNot to be blunt, but there\u2019s literally still tears on your face, and also I definitely saw you a few minutes ago before I jumped down here,\u201d he said, and you gave him a look. \u201cHey, just being honest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you very much,\u201d you insisted, not able to help from looking over his suit. The red and blue went well together - before all the pictures you had seen of him were black and white, and it seemed a little funny to you now that seeing him in color for the first time was also the first time you saw him in person.</p><p>\u201cYou checking me out?\u201d He did a little twirl for you, and you bit your lip to keep from laughing at the stupid pose he did.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know your suit was red and blue,\u201d you rolled your eyes, hoping he didn\u2019t notice you wipe under your eyes some more. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know either,\u201d he laughed a little, \u201cNot until recently, at least.\u201d</p><p>You smiled tightly, not able to help the small bit of jealousy you felt at his words. It seemed like everyone around you had a soulmate, even freaking Spider-Man. \u201cWhat colors did you think it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrange and green.\u201d</p><p>You snorted, \u201cThat would have been awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad I was wrong,\u201d he chuckled, crossing his legs and sitting next to you. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re pretty good at trying to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it worked for a minute there.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squinted at you, looking almost comical. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, we don\u2019t have to talk about it yet. I\u2019m Spider-Man, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He stuck his hand out, making you laugh a little as you shook it, \u201cI figured. I\u2019m Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty name,\u201d he complimented, and you ignored the funny feeling in your chest that came with it. </p><p>\u201cCatcher in the Rye, huh?\u201d He picked up your book, flicking through it, \u201cWhat part are you at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChapter ten,\u201d you scratched your head, \u201cI think. I was sort of falling asleep.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, handing you the book back. \u201cDon\u2019t really blame you on that. Took me two weeks to get through that book, and I was reading it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Spider-Man secretly a book worm?\u201d You teased a little, almost imagining him scrunching his nose up at the way his masked eyes squinted. </p><p>\u201cNah, just had to read it. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso had to read it. AP Lit summer reading list, one of four required books,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>\u201cAP Lit huh, you must be smart,\u201d you rolled your eyes at the compliment, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit early to get started on those, didn\u2019t most high schools just finish like two weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly bird catches the worm, isn\u2019t that the saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a bogus saying,\u201d he scoffed, his slightly offended tone making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s usually worked for me. What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Right away he dived into some rant about how and why that saying was stupid, and you couldn\u2019t help but be a little amused at how he waved his hands around while he talked, and despite not being able to see his face it was easy to guess what his expression was while he spoke.</p><p>Talking to Spider-Man at two in the morning was really weird but also felt completely normal. Just like the papers said, he was kind of a wisecrack, but his dumb jokes made you laugh and were good at distracting you from why you were crying earlier.</p><p>But you had a feeling he wasn\u2019t just there to talk, so you cut him off after he started talking about another subject.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd what am I doing?\u201d He replied a little cheekily, and you could hear a smile in his voice despite the slightly-off sound to it with the voice changer his AI provided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me by going on weirdly long rants about stupid common sayings so that I tell you why I was crying. Like, who goes on and on about the early bird saying like that? And somehow manages to change that subject to climate change and then to-to <i>Star Wars</i> from that? You have a serious hero complex, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, scratching his chin, \u201cYou know me so well already, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re trying to act like we\u2019re friends so that I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he held up his hands, laughing at how you pointed a finger at him in accusation, \u201cI told you I secretly like the Prequel movies the best, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that <i>does</i> make us friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really like the Prequel movies the best, do you? I mean, the original trilogy has to be the winner. Or at least the new series, like come on. You were just joking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell <i>now</i> I\u2019m not gonna say so, since you\u2019re being Miss Judgy over here - hey wait, now <i>you\u2019re</i> changing the subject again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me,\u201d you bit your lip to hide a laugh while he huffed, crossing his arms. \u201cHonestly, what are you doing? Why do you care so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like helping people, maybe I do have a bit of a hero complex,\u201d his masked eyes narrowed, facing you again. \u201cAnd you, no offense, looked like you might be in need of some help. Or just someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need help, and I don\u2019t need Spider-Man: Part Time Therapist, to try and trick me into talking about my problems, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart time therapist, I kinda like that,\u201d he mused, making you chuckle, \u201cFine, it\u2019s not my business. But talking about things helps a lot more than you might think, and people say I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you up on that another time.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t realize how tired you were the whole time you were both talking until you realized the sky was getting lighter. With a curse you grabbed your phone, seeing it was five am.</p><p>\u201cYou kept me up until sunrise!\u201d You complained, ignoring him laughing and holding his stomach at your expression.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve said you were tired, I would\u2019ve left you alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you would\u2019ve,\u201d you grabbed your book and old blanket, stuffing it under your arm as you started to feel how tired you actually were. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep until like, two pm now, so thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said cheekily, ignoring your dirty look. </p><p>\u201cOkay, goodnight, then. Or morning, whatever,\u201d you muttered, sliding your window open and starting to crawl in, but he put his gloved hand on your shoulder, stopping you briefly.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, will you be out here tomorrow?\u201d He asked carefully, making you smile a little.</p><p>A weird hopeful feeling went through your emotions, but you chose to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>",

You and MJ had wide smiles on your faces as you clapped for Liz, who was up front with the honor students and wearing her Salutatorian medal proudly. </p><p>You both ran up to her and squished her in a hug after the ceremony ended, nearly knocking her cap back off while the three of you laughed. Ned and Betty were there too, and you all took pictures with her upon her mom&rsquo;s insistence. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but look around for the only boy that was missing - you&rsquo;d think Peter would show up to his girlfriend&rsquo;s graduation, but you didn&rsquo;t see him at all.</p><p>That was strange. Liz didn&rsquo;t say anything about it and didn&rsquo;t seem upset about it, either, so none of you mentioned it. You almost expected him to appear at dinner when you all went out, but he was still absent, and Liz still didn&rsquo;t seem to act like anything was wrong. He probably had something come up - he was always running late to things and leaving early, or just not showing up. </p><p>The last time you had seen Peter was at the last decathlon meeting, where Mr. Harrington was trying to last minute plan a trip to Europe for the team so you could participate in an international competition.</p><p>It seemed like a fun idea - even though Liz and another senior on the team were graduating, they were also invited to join the group as they were still team members. The trip would be two weeks and the actual competition would be in London, but your teacher managed to plan it so that you could all sightsee in Venice and Prague as well. </p><p>You&rsquo;d always wanted to travel, especially to Italy, and it would be the perfect time to - right before senior year, before the stress of applying to colleges. You had planned on getting an internship next summer and hopefully a job for the ones following, so this was the best time to go on a trip.</p><p>The only downside would be seeing Peter with Liz for those two weeks, when you had hoped the whole summer break you could avoid seeing them at the same time. You had hoped to not see Peter at all, in fact.</p><p>But you were able to put those thoughts on the back burner for the time being. Summer started and you were finally able to relax after finals. You didn&rsquo;t see your friends much for the first few weeks - Ned and Betty went to a family reunion of hers a few states away, and Liz had gone somewhat off the grid after graduation - you figured she was relaxing after finally finishing high school. </p><p>You only saw MJ a handful of times - she started a new internship at an outreach center, and became almost as busy as Peter with his Stark internship. She still made time to see you and check in, though.</p><p>Liz and MJ both had different approaches to how they were going to act around you know that they knew you met your soulmate. Liz seemed to give you space - after you and her talked, she didn&rsquo;t really bother you anymore about it. MJ was almost the opposite. She could tell you didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it still, so she never pushed the subject, but she was always trying to distract you by offering to hang out in her spare time. </p><p>You appreciated that from both of them - seeing Liz was hard now. It wasn&rsquo;t her fault that her boyfriend was your soulmate, and you weren&rsquo;t mad at her for that. She didn&rsquo;t know, and even if she did, it was Peter who was at fault for not wanting to be with you, it wasn&rsquo;t her place to take the blame. But you were glad she was giving you space, knowing maybe subconsciously that that was the best thing for you at the moment. Seeing her always made you think of him, and what happened, and then it would just spiral from there.</p><p>Seeing MJ was easier. You knew she was suspicious of who it could be, but she never prodded for an answer, and you were grateful for that. If she found out it was Peter, there would suddenly be a huge split in your friend group, and that was the last thing you wanted.</p><p>Keeping your friends together was more important to you than your feelings for Peter being unrequited.</p><p>But time goes on, and soon enough school ended and you no longer had to worry about your friends finding out about what happened between you and him.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t heard anything from Peter since the end of school, per request that he doesn&rsquo;t contact you, and you were a little relieved about that. Every once in a while you felt some kind of emotion from him, more often than not guilt and regret in response to your ever-frequent pain, which still hadn&rsquo;t gone away since you both stopped talking.</p><p>The last few weeks of school consisted of you both dancing around each other, putting on an act in front of your friends, and not talking when you weren&rsquo;t with them. Peter tried to at first - you knew he did, you could feel a spark of anxiety on his side as he came up to you in the hallway or the library and you were able to escape, not wanting to talk to him. </p><p>That was the last thing you needed, another talk about how to mend your broken friendship. He eventually gave up, just going back to giving you moody looks in class and not bothering to hide his guilty emotions.</p><p>The summer nights were warm and you took to sitting out on your fire escape. You were lucky to have a large one right outside your window, that was even roof accessible so you could sit on the ledge and kick your feet in the air if you wanted.</p><p>There were plenty of books to read for AP Lit next year, so you spent most nights deciding to get through those as quick as possible what with the Europe trip coming up, and sitting outside helped. You somehow didn&rsquo;t get distracted by the noises of Queens, just getting lost in the stories as you leaned back against the brick wall and stretched your feet out through the rail.</p><p>That was what you were doing a few weeks into summer, finally able to relax after the stress of finals. You decided to read the first book on the list, The Catcher in the Rye, which was the shortest of the rest of them. It would probably be an easy start.</p><p>It was late by the time your eyes started drooping and you were getting bored, so you scrolled through Instagram for a while and then snapchat, feeling a little nostalgic and deciding to look through your memories.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>You were chuckling through the first couple - you had some goofy selfies you took with Ned during class when the teacher wasn&rsquo;t looking. The next ones were Liz and MJ posing with mannequins at the mall. There was one video of you and MJ pointing at Betty and Ned sitting together and yelling &ldquo;Is that allowed!&rdquo;</p><p>Going back further showed pictures of you and the decathlon team at finals, finding some selfies that Flash took on your phone when you probably weren&rsquo;t looking, which made you snort. You had a few videos of Abe ringing the bell every time Flash spoke, and some from the bus rides to and from competitions. You could see now the ugly yellow color the jackets were, making you chuckle at how stupid they looked.</p><p>One of them made you stop.</p><p>You remembered when you took the picture. It was of MJ, completely knocked out on the bus. It made you laugh because despite the driver going over every single bump, and all the noise from the team and someone who brought their speaker, she had managed to pass out and sleep the whole ride. </p><p>But now you focused on the background of the picture, which made your heart ache.</p><p>Liz, pretty as ever, sitting on a seat in the back with a wide smile on her face. Peter was leaning forward on the seat across from her, his hands under his chin while he talked to her, with the most adoring look you&rsquo;d ever seen on someone&rsquo;s face. He was staring at her like she was the only person that mattered.</p><p>You hadn&rsquo;t noticed them in the background of this picture when you took it, and you wished you hadn&rsquo;t now.</p><p>Seeing the look Peter was giving Liz made you feel more crappy than you had for the last several weeks. It took a while for you to get over the hurt (and honestly, you still hadn&rsquo;t gotten over it), but seeing this picture made you feel it even worse, and you felt your eyes sting.</p><p>You thought about Peter pretty much every day. It was lucky that you hadn&rsquo;t seen him since summer started, and it was easier to move on that way. Clearly, the last few weeks didn&rsquo;t do much to help that, though, as you were now crying over a stupid picture that you happened to come across.</p><p>Feeling like this sucked. And was kind of pathetic.</p><p>The thing about the sunburn was that it made your feelings for your soulmate more intense.

With a curse you grabbed your phone, seeing it was five am.</p><p>&ldquo;You kept me up until sunrise!&rdquo; You complained, ignoring him laughing and holding his stomach at your expression.</p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve said you were tired, I would&rsquo;ve left you alone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you would&rsquo;ve,&rdquo; you grabbed your book and old blanket, stuffing it under your arm as you started to feel how tired you actually were. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna sleep until like, two pm now, so thanks for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; he said cheekily, ignoring your dirty look. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, goodnight, then. Or morning, whatever,&rdquo; you muttered, sliding your window open and starting to crawl in, but he put his gloved hand on your shoulder, stopping you briefly.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, uh, will you be out here tomorrow?&rdquo; He asked carefully, making you smile a little.</p><p>A weird hopeful feeling went through your emotions, but you chose to ignore it.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>",

Your favorite month of the year. It was a time for celebration and embracing who you were. Yet each May when June begins approaching, you feel yourself dreading it, though you weren\u2019t sure why. Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were trans and you were afraid they would.</p><p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter\u2019s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?\u201d Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cHm? Oh shit sorry Peter I zoned out.\u201d You muttered, glancing at his book and flipping the pages in yours until it matched.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You responded, hoping he\u2019d get the message and move on. He did not.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve gotta be thinking about something! You really zoned out, clearly something\u2019s on your mind!\u201d He teased, chemistry long forgotten for him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing chem?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cChem is boring, besides we\u2019ve been doing it for ages.\u201d He whined. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201c\u2018M goin\u2019 to pride.\u201d You mumbled, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d He asked, eyebrows furrowed. You nodded. A silence took over the two of you.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should consider going with someone. Just want you to be safe, is all.\u201d He finally spoke, voice soft.</p><p>You shook your head, furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhy n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trans!\u201d You yelled, cutting him off. Peter\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m trans and no one knows. Except you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you are?\u201d He whispered, like he couldn\u2019t believe it. You nodded, your eyes on the floor. When Peter said nothing else, you panicked, beginning to grab your stuff.</p><p>\u201cUh, pretend I never said anything. I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo! No wait- Y/N wait.\u201d Peter called, following you to his front door where he stopped you from opening the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like I didn\u2019t care or anything.\u201d He started. \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d</p><p>This time it was your eyes that widened. \u201cReally?\u201d You asked. He nodded, pulling you in for a hug.</p><p>\u201c\u2018M proud of you.\u201d He muttered into your shoulder as you gripped his shirt tighter.</p><p>\u201c\u2018M proud of you too.\u201d You responded as the two of you pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWanna come to pride with me?\u201d You asked, Peter chuckling and nodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cPeter come on we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d You said, Peter mumbling an \u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d in response.</p><p>He finally emerged from his room in a bi pride t-shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cFinally. Took ya long enough.\u201d You teased as he rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He laughed, telling May the two of you would be back later before heading off to the parade.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cPeter this is awesome!\u201d You squealed, looking around at all the pride decorations on the New York City street. Peter smiled, nodding in response.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You just nodded, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cHey, before we get into the real fun festivities, I wanna show you something.\u201d</p><p>He pulled you off to the side to avoid getting in people\u2019s way. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He instructed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Parker?\u201d You asked as you shut your eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see just keep your eyes shut.\u201d He told you. You heard the unzipping of his small backpack, feeling something placed in your hands before you heard his bag being zipped back up. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d He instructed.</p><p>It took a minute for your eyes to adjust to the bright sun after being shut, glancing down at your hands where you saw a trans pride flag.</p><p>\u201cPeter-\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018S yours.\u201d He smiled as you just looked at him, the smile on your face growing. </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do.\u201d You said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou can keep it at my place if you want. May knows I\u2019m bi, she\u2019ll be cool if I keep anything pride related there.\u201d</p><p>You threw yourself in his arms, squeezing him tightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you thank you thank you.\u201d You mumbled as his arms wrapped around your body.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He whispered as you two separated.</p><p>\u201cShall we go celebrate?\u201d You asked, Peter nodding. \u201cWell let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh by the way,\u201d Peter started. \u201cFigured now would be a good time to mention this. I\u2019m Spiderman.\u201d He paused, showing you the suit in his bag while you were clearly in shock, trying to process it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d You gasped, finally finding your words.</p><p>\u201cNo cops at this pride, just your friendly neighborhood bisexual Spiderman.\u201d</p><p>_______________________________________________________________________</p><p> tags + some mutuals: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVZTWe1UaQH7s3eQsiPDpfw\">@harmfulfiz</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmEgYgee3kdLU3NndUcYkhw\">@avispate</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m44Dmt7xDGY9BJGt-11qX1Q\">@tintedsnowrose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mS1pLdaFlUyOax36ESDqtCw\">@izzythefanfreak</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vxBi6bTUy5w6MfG8dvLhA\">@itzmegaaaaaaan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mKyE4hPtVsqe3tlBLQFHI9w\">@trashqueenbitch</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7wOdzJ8rJCuRKkaJPS3Tmg\">@biggalaxytrashcollection</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2sGOmRlq8MwFleb1fFMs7Q\">@dottirose</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvbXKHbKPoE4QEqJpYDopgA\">@pianista-bookworm</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvuUXaPIFmLprYh8RJK-kvg\">@squeakyfive</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mj35CJEbKN_LdGUpw_1Iueg\">@thatshortanimegirl</a> <strike>@unicornoncrack</strike> <strike>@obsessivereader36</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPFxHY8REuuznMmvEVgTZSw\">@im-peter-bytheway</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFXd-QeGKaC70sheZ_s0YVw\">@lemirabitur</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8vUxZR8qg4e8iMYkr_TigQ\">@embrace-themagic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJImvoCRjTLeJ9b-kXC5Xkg\">@thatonepanhuman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msPK2gSl972-H7sCAI0_ceg\">@anastasiaformarvel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPG3dCtgYjCSr9l0TsM7CAQ\">@pleasantlysecretdream</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_bjew_o6hmvY25rTGjVwaA\">@totallyreadyforthis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mh-l_1nAEnw1asGaHKx_Yjw\">@assbuttplaid</a><strike>@lordabby</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbtHTeE3_XqmFwNeHpBWuWQ\">@linkpk88</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn24ZUmNiDnobMTsTvFaNAg\">@crxssourbones</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mo1Yj8U6xBJgbppYmrgN9oQ\">@anaprieto0</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrleVcH6YprB5lyvfl_uqsA\">@babebenhardy</a><strike>@meeeeeeeeeps</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSlAYZRuXzh_5xcKI-QwRvw\">@bitchacho25</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGPu3C1uGC4J7tnZ0gQ8Ghg\">@dangerousluv1</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAUoKt4RJF-nbqpQs5f84VA\">@alex\u2013awesome\u201322</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzjN8EWGdAWfbhgiJdujZNg\">@gummyhoneybees</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2UWu9oPe9SeRY3OddUKxEw\">@bigmcchickenmood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma0UHsI1AxsLkBOUe35FfTA\">@captainbuckyy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLDF7kbUiItX64tYPzS6-rA\">@parkeroffline</a> <strike>@0oof-oof0</strike> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSJqulxO7QybhnAJ1VXrOkQ\">@spidey-holland7</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2kt74kDHqM5BU5U09mgRFA\">@13-breadsticks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maaY8py5WNK8Ftux4I1JLdQ\">@its-the-unknownspidey</a> \u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXk1P_lqJGTX4UXJFK1NFQQ\">@darlingxholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwoFuu5hzk-y5VbDvQsoRSw\">@bellamyblakemorley</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEsnslz1vUv5_Kh5P2sI3Pg\">@spiderboytotherescue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZHLoejFFyYHjgR5CnNM2ig\">@spideypeach</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mu-cuKUPj0YkYMKak5wJTYQ\">@astrospideys</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mAOWx55aDqElM1MmP63JGuQ\">@hollandroos</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3WadIP9NySuw2fE3WxaO4w\">@loverholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTsCjJQIx5NXgxzB-znf3sQ\">@moonlit-void-to-the-far-unknown</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m57JD5arDGPQkxn9DyRK14Q\">@tomshufflepuf</a>f <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY502FLoAHXSjqkG2iiCEcg\">@tommyhollandd</a><br/></p>",

Your favorite month of the year. It was a time for celebration and embracing who you were. Yet each May when June begins approaching, you feel yourself dreading it, though you weren\u2019t sure why. Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were trans and you were afraid they would.</p><p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter\u2019s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?\u201d Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHm? Oh shit sorry Peter I zoned out.\u201d You muttered, glancing at his book and flipping the pages in yours until it matched.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You responded, hoping he\u2019d get the message and move on. He did not.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you\u2019ve gotta be thinking about something! You really zoned out, clearly something\u2019s on your mind!\u201d He teased, chemistry long forgotten for him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing chem?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cChem is boring, besides we\u2019ve been doing it for ages.\u201d He whined. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You sighed. \u201c\u2018M goin\u2019 to pride.\u201d You mumbled, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d He asked, eyebrows furrowed. You nodded. A silence took over the two of you.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should consider going with someone. Just want you to be safe, is all.\u201d He finally spoke, voice soft.</p><p>You shook your head, furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhy n-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trans!\u201d You yelled, cutting him off. Peter\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m trans and no one knows. Except you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026you are?\u201d He whispered, like he couldn\u2019t believe it. You nodded, your eyes on the floor. When Peter said nothing else, you panicked, beginning to grab your stuff.</p><p>\u201cUh, pretend I never said anything. I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow.\u201d You muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo! No wait- Y/N wait.\u201d Peter called, following you to his front door where he stopped you from opening the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like I didn\u2019t care or anything.\u201d He started. \u201cI\u2019m bi.\u201d</p><p>This time it was your eyes that widened. \u201cReally?\u201d You asked.

Maybe it was because no one in your life knew you were trans and you were afraid they would.</p><p>You were sure the people in your life would be fine if you told them. Especially Peter, your best friend. There was no doubt in your mind that Peter would be your number one supporter if you were to come out. But you decorated your closet comfortably, and knew you would rather stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>June arrived quickly and you made plans to go to pride by yourself but only for a couple hours. It would be a nice break from studying for final exams and you could celebrate for once! You were at Peter&rsquo;s studying for chemistry when you zoned out, thinking about what it would be like.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N? Helloooo, anyone in there?&rdquo; Peter asked, waving his hand in front of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm? Oh shit sorry Peter I zoned out.&rdquo; You muttered, glancing at his book and flipping the pages in yours until it matched.</p><p>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; You responded, hoping he&rsquo;d get the message and move on. He did not.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on, you&rsquo;ve gotta be thinking about something! You really zoned out, clearly something&rsquo;s on your mind!&rdquo; He teased, chemistry long forgotten for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be doing chem?&rdquo; You asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Chem is boring, besides we&rsquo;ve been doing it for ages.&rdquo; He whined. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed. &ldquo;&lsquo;M goin&rsquo; to pride.&rdquo; You mumbled, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>&ldquo;By yourself?&rdquo; He asked, eyebrows furrowed. You nodded. A silence took over the two of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you should consider going with someone. Just want you to be safe, is all.&rdquo; He finally spoke, voice soft.</p><p>You shook your head, furiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Why n-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trans!&rdquo; You yelled, cutting him off. Peter&rsquo;s eyes widened.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trans and no one knows. Except you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&hellip;you are?&rdquo; He whispered, like he couldn&rsquo;t believe it. You nodded, your eyes on the floor. When Peter said nothing else, you panicked, beginning to grab your stuff.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, pretend I never said anything. I&rsquo;ll see you at school tomorrow.&rdquo; You muttered.</p><p>&ldquo;No! No wait- Y/N wait.&rdquo; Peter called, following you to his front door where he stopped you from opening the door.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you feel like I didn&rsquo;t care or anything.&rdquo; He started. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bi.&rdquo;</p><p>This time it was your eyes that widened. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; You asked. He nodded, pulling you in for a hug.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M proud of you.&rdquo; He muttered into your shoulder as you gripped his shirt tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M proud of you too.&rdquo; You responded as the two of you pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;Wanna come to pride with me?&rdquo; You asked, Peter chuckling and nodding.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Peter come on we&rsquo;re gonna be late!&rdquo; You said, Peter mumbling an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; in response.</p><p>He finally emerged from his room in a bi pride t-shirt and jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;Finally. Took ya long enough.&rdquo; You teased as he rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo; He laughed, telling May the two of you would be back later before heading off to the parade.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Peter this is awesome!&rdquo; You squealed, looking around at all the pride decorations on the New York City street. Peter smiled, nodding in response.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty sick, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; You just nodded, smiling from ear to ear. &ldquo;Hey, before we get into the real fun festivities, I wanna show you something.&rdquo;</p><p>He pulled you off to the side to avoid getting in people&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Close your eyes.&rdquo; He instructed.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing, Parker?&rdquo; You asked as you shut your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see just keep your eyes shut.&rdquo; He told you. You heard the unzipping of his small backpack, feeling something placed in your hands before you heard his bag being zipped back up. &ldquo;Open your eyes.&rdquo; He instructed.</p><p>It took a minute for your eyes to adjust to the bright sun after being shut, glancing down at your hands where you saw a trans pride flag.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;S yours.&rdquo; He smiled as you just looked at him, the smile on your face growing. </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do.&rdquo; You said quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;You can keep it at my place if you want.
