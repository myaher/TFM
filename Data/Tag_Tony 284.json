        "answer": "<p>I have written this fic three times since tumblr keeps eating my work.\u00a0</p><p>Frostironstrange mall AU</p><p><br/></p><p>They had all met at a gala. Specific, the Rainbow Ball held one a year at the mall\u2019s center for queer youth. It was meant for donors and center users alike, and while Tony had been attending every year since the center was founded, it was the first time Stephen had worked up the nerves to attend despite being a long time donor and Loki had only recently moved into the area. Tony had seen the both of them in passing before, their stores were all right next to one another after all, so it was hard to not have, but he had never had reason to speak to either of them. He\u2019d given up suits when he had retired from being the CEO of Stark Games to run the original store and he\u2019d never really been one for any of that herbal stuff.\u00a0</p><p>Having said that, he\u2019d actually found himself quite taken with both of them. Loki was a self-made store owner who\u2019d run away (escaped) from home at 16 and worked their way through college to dual-major in fashion design and business. They had several suit lines unique to their company built for all sorts of body types, and most of their business was done online. Loki still loved owning their store though and did free fittings for kids referred to them by the center, they\u2019d said there was nothing quite like fitting a young trans boy for his first proper suit or helping a young lesbian couple get ready for prom night. Loki themselves wore a form fitting green and gold suit that had felt like clouds when Tony had brushed their wrist, and Tony was starting to wonder if maybe it wasn\u2019t time for a new suit after all.\u00a0</p><p>Stephen on the other hand, Tony hadn\u2019t expected to get along with. He\u2019d never been fond of the whole esoteric scene. Too much fake science and dead bodies from lack of proper medical care. At the Rainbow Ball, Tony had broached the subject after polite small talk and been delighted to discover that Stephen was not only an actual medical doctor formerly (poor guys hands couldn\u2019t do it anymore, he hadn\u2019t even been able to write prescriptions towards the end), but Stephen preached vaccines and proper medical care to every person who came to his store even going so far as to ban or report certain customers that failed to get their children important medical care in favor of crystals. Instead his store was focused on education, proper home remedies that had scientific backing for mild conditions and some ingredients for potions and spells that Stephen always made sure people never put too much stock in. Tony found himself quite taken by the man. Between Stephen and Loki, Tony had spent the entire night talking to just the two of them.\u00a0</p><p>The next day, he\u2019d been teased endlessly by his two sales clerks working that day. Peter and Shuri had also both attended the Rainbow Ball unfortunately and neither were going to leave him alone.</p><p>\u201cSooooo.\u201d Shuri had both eyebrows up and a grin on her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Tony repeated back to her, trying his very best to put on his \u2018I\u2019m-your-manager\u2019 face and failing.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSo when can we expect you to start having lawyers and lobbyists calling while you\u2019re getting polyamorus marriage legalized?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>That caught Tony off guard, and he resolutely turned back to stocking games so neither Shuri nor Peter who was now giggling the background could see his blush. After a moment to breath he responded.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I am done with dealing with lawyers. I\u2019d ask Pepper to deal with that. Second, I\u2019ve spoke to the both of them once max. You\u2019ve got no idea if either of them are even okay with poly relationships like I am or if we\u2019ll ever speak again.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong~!\u201d Shuri singsonged and all the sudden she had Tony\u2019s attention. One of the reasons he\u2019d be convincing himself not to even try with Stephen or Loki was that most people weren\u2019t cool with the fact he was poly, it was what had ruined his (romantic) relationship with Pepper. If they were already okay with that though&hellip; He tried to keep his cool, just barely managing to not turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Keep it casual. That\u2019s it Tony.<br/></p><p>It was Peter that replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI actually asked them about it after you had to leave last night! Mostly because Shuri dared me to since she\u2019s a bad friend. Loki is poly too, but hasn\u2019t dated anyone for quite awhile since a lot of people aren\u2019t cool with the genderfluid thing. Mr. Stephen hadn\u2019t dated anyone poly before but was open to the idea, said he\u2019s nervous about the whole pan thing but never really been the jealous type.\u201d Peter reported all of this in a very matter of fact tone, and god bless him for his through information gathering.\u00a0</p><p>Before Tony could reply to any of that, Shuri piped up as she turned back to where she was finishing an xbox repair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, also, Pepper called and she\u2019s making you go to the Stark Gaming Annual Company Whatever. Apparently something about setting an example since our store does so well in customer satisfaction. So it looks like you\u2019ll be needing a new suit soon.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even had to look at her to know she was giving him the eyebrow wiggle. He rolled his eyes as he tucked the last game onto the shelf and turned around to face the two of them, hands on his hips as they both gave him their best innocent expressions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine. I\u2019ll go tomorrow, but there\u2019s no promises this goes anywhere, and no trying to set me up with the two them.

Specific, the Rainbow Ball held one a year at the mall\u2019s center for queer youth. It was meant for donors and center users alike, and while Tony had been attending every year since the center was founded, it was the first time Stephen had worked up the nerves to attend despite being a long time donor and Loki had only recently moved into the area. Tony had seen the both of them in passing before, their stores were all right next to one another after all, so it was hard to not have, but he had never had reason to speak to either of them. He\u2019d given up suits when he had retired from being the CEO of Stark Games to run the original store and he\u2019d never really been one for any of that herbal stuff.\u00a0</p><p>Having said that, he\u2019d actually found himself quite taken with both of them. Loki was a self-made store owner who\u2019d run away (escaped) from home at 16 and worked their way through college to dual-major in fashion design and business. They had several suit lines unique to their company built for all sorts of body types, and most of their business was done online. Loki still loved owning their store though and did free fittings for kids referred to them by the center, they\u2019d said there was nothing quite like fitting a young trans boy for his first proper suit or helping a young lesbian couple get ready for prom night. Loki themselves wore a form fitting green and gold suit that had felt like clouds when Tony had brushed their wrist, and Tony was starting to wonder if maybe it wasn\u2019t time for a new suit after all.\u00a0</p><p>Stephen on the other hand, Tony hadn\u2019t expected to get along with. He\u2019d never been fond of the whole esoteric scene. Too much fake science and dead bodies from lack of proper medical care. At the Rainbow Ball, Tony had broached the subject after polite small talk and been delighted to discover that Stephen was not only an actual medical doctor formerly (poor guys hands couldn\u2019t do it anymore, he hadn\u2019t even been able to write prescriptions towards the end), but Stephen preached vaccines and proper medical care to every person who came to his store even going so far as to ban or report certain customers that failed to get their children important medical care in favor of crystals. Instead his store was focused on education, proper home remedies that had scientific backing for mild conditions and some ingredients for potions and spells that Stephen always made sure people never put too much stock in. Tony found himself quite taken by the man. Between Stephen and Loki, Tony had spent the entire night talking to just the two of them.\u00a0</p><p>The next day, he\u2019d been teased endlessly by his two sales clerks working that day. Peter and Shuri had also both attended the Rainbow Ball unfortunately and neither were going to leave him alone.</p><p>\u201cSooooo.\u201d Shuri had both eyebrows up and a grin on her face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Tony repeated back to her, trying his very best to put on his \u2018I\u2019m-your-manager\u2019 face and failing.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSo when can we expect you to start having lawyers and lobbyists calling while you\u2019re getting polyamorus marriage legalized?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>That caught Tony off guard, and he resolutely turned back to stocking games so neither Shuri nor Peter who was now giggling the background could see his blush. After a moment to breath he responded.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I am done with dealing with lawyers. I\u2019d ask Pepper to deal with that. Second, I\u2019ve spoke to the both of them once max. You\u2019ve got no idea if either of them are even okay with poly relationships like I am or if we\u2019ll ever speak again.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong~!\u201d Shuri singsonged and all the sudden she had Tony\u2019s attention. One of the reasons he\u2019d be convincing himself not to even try with Stephen or Loki was that most people weren\u2019t cool with the fact he was poly, it was what had ruined his (romantic) relationship with Pepper. If they were already okay with that though\u2026 He tried to keep his cool, just barely managing to not turn to face her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Keep it casual. That\u2019s it Tony.<br></p><p>It was Peter that replied.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI actually asked them about it after you had to leave last night! Mostly because Shuri dared me to since she\u2019s a bad friend. Loki is poly too, but hasn\u2019t dated anyone for quite awhile since a lot of people aren\u2019t cool with the genderfluid thing. Mr. Stephen hadn\u2019t dated anyone poly before but was open to the idea, said he\u2019s nervous about the whole pan thing but never really been the jealous type.\u201d Peter reported all of this in a very matter of fact tone, and god bless him for his through information gathering.\u00a0</p><p>Before Tony could reply to any of that, Shuri piped up as she turned back to where she was finishing an xbox repair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, also, Pepper called and she\u2019s making you go to the Stark Gaming Annual Company Whatever. Apparently something about setting an example since our store does so well in customer satisfaction. So it looks like you\u2019ll be needing a new suit soon.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Tony didn\u2019t even had to look at her to know she was giving him the eyebrow wiggle. He rolled his eyes as he tucked the last game onto the shelf and turned around to face the two of them, hands on his hips as they both gave him their best innocent expressions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlright, fine. I\u2019ll go tomorrow, but there\u2019s no promises this goes anywhere, and no trying to set me up with the two them. Am I clear?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes Mr. Stark.\u201d with two matching expressions that told him his orders were absolutely going to be disregarded.

She&rsquo;d brought it up over sushi from the little store built into the mall and after some discussion on boundaries, how to ask him, and some very enthusiastic planning, Tony had been more then happy to agree.&nbsp;</p><p>They asked him together one night close to closing time, and after convincing him that they really meant it, Stephen had agreed.&nbsp;</p><p>As it so happened, it was two years from that point when Tony gave Pepper a call and asked for her help in pulling some legal strings and after a lot of money put into lobbying, a very passionate movement and quite a few lawsuits later, at year four in their relationship the legislation passed and the next day Tony went to the alter, walking away with his husband and spouse.&nbsp;</p>",
