He said,\u00a0\u201cIt is swords I need from them, not kisses.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>So here is Jon the diplomat, Jon the reconciler, Jon the realist.\u00a0 Jon understands instinctively that the best rulers are loved, that a ruler should strive to win his people\u2019s affection. \u00a0</p><p>Instead we get this fanatic line from Melisandre:</p><p>\u201cOne realm, one god, one king!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not an exact translation, but it\u2019s pretty close to the Nazis\u2019\u00a0\u201cEin Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Fuehrer.\u201d\u00a0 I think GRRM meant us to make that association.</p><p>Jon remains focused on his central mission.\u00a0 He tells Bowen Marsh:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe have seen the face of our real foe, a dead white face with bright blue eyes. The free folk have seen that face as well. Stannis is not wrong in this.\u00a0 <b>We must make common cause with the wildlings.\u201d</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p></blockquote><p>When Marsh argues that the Night\u2019s Watch would be safer if the gates of Castle Black were sealed and the wildlings kept beyond the Wall, Jon replies carefully but carries the argument.</p><blockquote><p>&hellip;what Bowen was suggesting went against all of Jon\u2019s <b>instincts.</b>\u00a0\u201cIf we seal the gates, we cannot send out rangers,\u201d he pointed out.\u00a0\u201cWe will be as good as blind.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>An alchemy hero, the\u00a0\u201cheart\u201d character, always has empathy.\u00a0 And this empathy is inborn&ndash;instinctive&ndash;not learned. \u00a0 (I gave up counting the number of times Harry Potter is described as acting\u00a0\u201cinstinctively.\u201d)</p><p>Jon\u2019s next test comes from his own men, his best friends in the Night\u2019s Watch.\u00a0 He goes to join them for dinner, but they are mocking Melisandre and her religion. Pyp says,</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe night is dark and full of turnips&hellip;.\u201d\u00a0 His friends laughed&ndash;Grenn, Toad, Satin, the whole lot of them.</p></blockquote><p>Jon has to reprove them several times before they stop:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMaking mock of another man\u2019s prayer is fool\u2019s work, Pyp. And dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your gods and she has hers. Leave her be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Melisandre is not part of my command. You are. I won\u2019t have bad blood between the king\u2019s men and my own.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>So again we see Jon attempting to reconcile opposites.\u00a0 The men finally calm down and Grenn invites him to dine with them.\u00a0 But Jon has\u00a0\u201ckilled the boy\u201d and realizes that the days of easy companionship are over.\u00a0 We get this paragraph that sums up how Jon now realizes and accepts his new role. \u00a0</p><blockquote><p>No, he had to tell himself,<i> those days are gone</i>. The realization twisted in his belly like a knife. They had chosen him to rule. The Wall was his, and their lives were his as well. <i>A lord may love the men that he commands</i>, he could hear his lord father saying, b<i>ut he cannot be a friend to them. One day he may need to sit in judgment on them, or send them forth to die.</i>\u00a0\u201cAnother day,\u201d the lord commander lied.\u00a0\u201cEdd. best see to your own supper. I have work to finish.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This is the only time in the chapter when Jon thinks about the advice of his very first alchemist, his father. \u00a0</p><p>Once he\u2019s alone, Jon reflects on his choice to reject Stannis\u2019 offer of Val and Winterfell.</p><blockquote><p>Instead he had chosen a black cloak and a wall of ice. Instead he had chosen honor. <i>A bastard\u2019s sort of honor.</i></p></blockquote><p><i>S</i>o here is the word honor again.\u00a0 In AFFC we saw Jaime Lannister choose honor and stick to it in his dealings with Brienne and Riverrun, among others.\u00a0 Now Jon has done the same, consciously and deliberately.\u00a0 Jon thinks to himself<i>,\u00a0\u201cI should be walking the <b>ice. The Wall is mine.</b>\u201d</i></p><p>Jon, as the Mercury/Argentvive of the story, is water and earth.\u00a0 Here we have an explicit statement of his mastery of water, i.e., ice in this case.</p><p>Ghost appears at Jon\u2019s side, and Jon\u2019s warg sense detects the \u201ctaste of hot blood.\u201d</p><blockquote><p><i>No, </i>he thought<i>. I am a man, not a wolf.</i></p></blockquote><p>The obvious meaning of the words is that Jon is denying his animalistic, warg self.\u00a0 But there is a strong alchemical meaning too.</p><p>When I first started my blog I wrote about how Jon\u2019s association with a white wolf doesn\u2019t just mark him as White (the Stark sigell does that too).\u00a0 It marks him as the prima materia, the raw material that is being transformed.\u00a0 The prima materia used by the alchemists of history was an ore of antimony, and antimony was called the\u00a0\u201cwolf of<i> </i>metals.\u201d\u00a0 So in alchemical illustrations, the prima materia<i> </i>was often symbolized by a wolf<i>. (</i>Michael Maier<i>, Atalanta fugiens)</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"232\" data-orig-height=\"218\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/134c04121a4aedd1b01c26a7e28069dd/tumblr_inline_ppat5hWg5b1qfc575_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"232\" data-orig-height=\"218\"/></figure><p>For the prima materia to be transformed, it must be \u201ckilled\u201d\u00a0 in the alchemical process of <i>solve et coagula</i>.\u00a0 So in Jon\u2019s declaration that\u00a0\u201cI am a man, not a wolf,\u201d he is saying, in a different way, that he has killed the boy and let the man be born. \u00a0</p><p>Only Jon, Daenerys, and Jaime are associated with animals that symbolize the early stages of the alchemical process:\u00a0 Jon with antimony, the prima materia; Daenerys with dragons, the symbol for Mercurius; and Jaime with the green lion, another symbol for the prima materia. \u00a0</p><p>So yes, logically, we could expect Ghost and the dragons to die at the end, as their masters achieve full transformation to the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.</p><p>Jon finally finds someone to talk to&ndash;Clydas, the 60-year-old steward.\u00a0 Jon reveals that he has obeyed Aemon Targaryen\u2019s other instruction, to read the <i>Jade Compendium</i>, a history of Westeros.\u00a0 It\u2019s quite an odd title, but I suspect it\u2019s GRRM\u2019s play on the legendary founding document of alchemy, the Emerald Tablet. \u00a0</p><p>Here is where the Lightbringer/Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa prophecy is laid out.\u00a0 Jon explains how the original Lightbringer was always warm to the touch, while Stannis\u2019 Lightbringer is cold.\u00a0 So it\u2019s not just the wrong colors but the wrong temperature!</p><p>The chapter ends with Jon\u2019s rueful comment about his fate:</p><blockquote><p><i>This is my lot</i>, he realized as he undressed, <i>from now until the end of my days.</i></p></blockquote><p>And of course he\u2019s wrong.</p>",

The Wall is mine.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon, as the Mercury/Argentvive of the story, is water and earth.&nbsp; Here we have an explicit statement of his mastery of water, i.e., ice in this case.</p><p>Ghost appears at Jon&rsquo;s side, and Jon&rsquo;s warg sense detects the &ldquo;taste of hot blood.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p><i>No, </i>he thought<i>. I am a man, not a wolf.</i></p></blockquote><p>The obvious meaning of the words is that Jon is denying his animalistic, warg self.&nbsp; But there is a strong alchemical meaning too.</p><p>When I first started my blog I wrote about how Jon&rsquo;s association with a white wolf doesn&rsquo;t just mark him as White (the Stark sigell does that too).&nbsp; It marks him as the prima materia, the raw material that is being transformed.&nbsp; The prima materia used by the alchemists of history was an ore of antimony, and antimony was called the&nbsp;&ldquo;wolf of<i> </i>metals.&rdquo;&nbsp; So in alchemical illustrations, the prima materia<i> </i>was often symbolized by a wolf<i>. (</i>Michael Maier<i>, Atalanta fugiens)</i></p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/134c04121a4aedd1b01c26a7e28069dd/tumblr_inline_ppat5hWg5b1qfc575_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>For the prima materia to be transformed, it must be &ldquo;killed&rdquo;&nbsp; in the alchemical process of <i>solve et coagula</i>.&nbsp; So in Jon&rsquo;s declaration that&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a man, not a wolf,&rdquo; he is saying, in a different way, that he has killed the boy and let the man be born. &nbsp;</p><p>Only Jon, Daenerys, and Jaime are associated with animals that symbolize the early stages of the alchemical process:&nbsp; Jon with antimony, the prima materia; Daenerys with dragons, the symbol for Mercurius; and Jaime with the green lion, another symbol for the prima materia. &nbsp;</p><p>So yes, logically, we could expect Ghost and the dragons to die at the end, as their masters achieve full transformation to the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone.</p><p>Jon finally finds someone to talk to&ndash;Clydas, the 60-year-old steward.&nbsp; Jon reveals that he has obeyed Aemon Targaryen&rsquo;s other instruction, to read the <i>Jade Compendium</i>, a history of Westeros.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite an odd title, but I suspect it&rsquo;s GRRM&rsquo;s play on the legendary founding document of alchemy, the Emerald Tablet. &nbsp;</p><p>Here is where the Lightbringer/Azor Ahai/Nissa Nissa prophecy is laid out.&nbsp; Jon explains how the original Lightbringer was always warm to the touch, while Stannis&rsquo; Lightbringer is cold.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s not just the wrong colors but the wrong temperature!</p><p>The chapter ends with Jon&rsquo;s rueful comment about his fate:</p><blockquote><p><i>This is my lot</i>, he realized as he undressed, <i>from now until the end of my days.</i></p></blockquote><p>And of course he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>",
