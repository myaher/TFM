By all means, it should be easier but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like Tony wants to be killed or something, he\u2019s always attending parties late and bringing home strangers (mostly women). If Tony gets killed whilst she\u2019s on the job, she\u2019ll get fired, Grace knows that because it\u2019s her duty to protect this man.<br/></p><p>The schedule given to her is hardly his actual day, he spends most of it down in his work-lab, that she isn&rsquo;t allowed in or he goes out- requesting she does all the work Pepper usually does. It\u2019s like looking after a child, a child that thinks he\u2019s in charge and can do as he pleases, but yet has responsibilities that he refuses to acknowledge. All it took was two days, two days for Grace to flip. </p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d Grace sternly tells the sleeping Stark, he groans as she commands Jarvis to open his black-out blinds, \u201cyou\u2019re not having me attend <i>YOUR </i>meetings for you, you have to go to them and I\u2019ll come along with you.\u201d </p><p>Tony sits up and rubs his eyes, scowling at the woman before him. Dressed in a lilac blazer, matching pencil skirt and arms crossed. The look reminded Tony one of which his mother used to wear, it made a chill shoot up his spine. A small part of him didn\u2019t believe she was a simple PA, from her steely glare and her eyes always scanning her surroundings. It\u2019s like she was looking for some form of trouble, always on guard and, usually, PA\u2019s don\u2019t have a \u2018fuck off\u2019 attitude. They\u2019re meant to be welcoming and always happy to help and do, yet Grace is different.</p><p>Tony thought better to argue with the woman, deciding to get out of bed and dressed. Grace averted her eyes away as he searched for clothes, throwing on some band tee and jeans. Running his fingers through his hair quickly, turning to Grace with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attending a meeting for a multi-million dollar business,\u201d Grace began, \u201cand you\u2019re attending in a band-tee?\u201d Grace sighed when Tony only shrugged, grabbing a dark navy blazer and throwing that on over it. \u201cwell, hurry up and find some shoes, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Grace walks out of Tony\u2019s bedroom and releases a long sigh, she isn\u2019t scared of him but telling a billionaire what to do or even being stern with him\u2026 felt slightly terrifying. She didn\u2019t want to push her luck and have him fire her, then how is she meant to protect him? 24hr surveillance outside his house? She\u2019s done that before and it killed her back having to sleep in the back of a car.</p><p>Tony exits his room, with a grumpy frown, she would\u2019ve told him to have a shower but they didn\u2019t have enough time, but he still reeked of whatever alcohol he was inducing the night before. The smell of sweat, booze and perfume lingered on his skin, it was a little hard to breathe around him. Grace pulled out a pocket-sized perfume spray, spritzing it on him as they walked to the car. </p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Tony harshly slapped her hand away making her almost drop the perfume. </p><p>\u201cWell if you were a responsible human I wouldn\u2019t be having to spray you just to make you smell, somewhat, lovely.\u201d Grace snaps back, \u201cthank you, Happy.\u201d She kindly smiles at the man she had gotten a little closer with. </p><p>Turns out, Tony would rather drive himself places - when he\u2019s sober, at least- Happy often drives behind Tony being his security detail, they have a close relationship, almost sibling-like. Happy is the only person Grace has come across that has anything nice to say about Stark, apart from the obvious brown-nosers, the people that want something from Tony, Happy seems to really know him and still attests to the fact Tony is a good man. </p><p>The drive is long and silent, \u201cSo\u2026 what is this meeting about?\u201d Grace asked, eyeing Tony from the side and toying with her hands in her lap. </p><p>\u201cJust Stark Industries stuff, future of the company and so forth, you know, we\u2019re making weapons for the government so it\u2019s best to keep on top of legal stuff,\u201d Tony explained and Grace nodded along. \u201cI\u2019m CEO it\u2019s good for me to attend these things, I prefer the little events we do, the testers and reveals of the latest weapons.\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckled slightly, \u201cCEO, really?\u201d Tony only nodded his head, \u201cbut you\u2019re only thirty.\u201d </p><p>He simply shrugs, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Grace held her hands up in defence, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you inherit a company, I was only twenty when my parents died. I wasn\u2019t old enough to run the company, so Obadiah Stane was CEO till I turned twenty-one. He\u2019s been friends of my family for years, he mostly attends the meetings and does all this boring stuff.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been difficult for him to hand over the company back to you,\u201d Tony frowned and looked at Grace, who only shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m just saying being CEO of a company, only for some twenty-one-year-old know-it-all take over. Think I\u2019d go insane,\u201d Grace joked and snorted loudly before calming down. </p><p>They both walked inside the Stark Industries building, Tony nodding \u2018hello\u2019 at a few employees. Grace hung a little behind, feeling a tad out of place. A big part of her praying that she\u2019ll get a phone call saying they caught the guy, that she can stop and go back to her normal desk and be an Agent again. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d A deep voice carries across the building, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for you to turn up.\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes the taller man\u2019s hand, a smile on both of their faces. \u201cYeah, well my temporary personal assistant insisted I attended today.\u201d </p><p>Grace gives a little wave, Stane only nods in her direction before putting an arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and walking him towards the meeting room. In a deep conversation about the company and other things that Grace doesn\u2019t care about, her eyes scan the room of the faces. Anyone of these people could be working for whoever wants to take Stark down, she\u2019d have to remember to get the team to look into every Stark employee. </p><p>It\u2019d be quicker to ask JARVIS but she didn\u2019t want to raise alarm bells to Tony, despite the technology being at her fingertips, she had to be smart about this. Listen to instruction and just keep Tony safe, no searching or prying for the person; priority is Anthony Stark. </p><p>\u201cOh, she can wait out here. Usually, you don\u2019t attend, since you\u2019re here, no one has to take notes.\u201d Stane smiles and leads Tony into the room, shutting it on Grace\u2019s face. </p><p>She scowled at the door for a moment before turning and sitting on a chair, crossing her legs and huffing loudly. She pulled the skirt down a little, grumbling under her breath. She\u2019s used to pant-suits, not skirts and dresses- thankfully, she hasn\u2019t had to wear a dress, yet. Whoever Miss Potts is, she\u2019s a saint, that\u2019s for sure. Having to deal with Tony all day, every day: it\u2019s hard work. Honestly, she couldn\u2019t wait to go back and just do desk duty again. </p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Happy\u2019s voice breaks her out of her mind, she sighs heavily and crosses her arms causing Happy to chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad working for him, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d </p><p>Grace scoffs, \u201cI hope I never have to, I just can\u2019t wait to go back to being an Agent again.\u201d Graces eyes scan over everyone again, \u201chave you done background checks on everyone that works here?\u201d Happy nods, \u201cdo you have any ideas on who could be doing this?\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cThe list of enemies for a Stark is\u2026 long, believe it or not. Being a billionaire kinds puts a bullseye on your back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat about that Stane guy?\u201d Happy scoffs loudly, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cI get a weird vibe from him, especially since he used to be CEO then Tony took over. Imagine putting your life&rsquo;s work into something, only for the bosses son to get all the glory. \u00a0Plus in the short while, Tony has been CEO here, he\u2019s really made this place flourish. That type of-\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not Stane. He\u2019s been friends with Howard for years, he\u2019s really helped Tony steer this company and lead him. He\u2019s the last person that would want Tony dead.\u201d </p><p>Grace could only nod at what Happy said, yet a gut feeling told her to look into the man. She couldn\u2019t rule anyone out till she checked herself, even though technically it isn\u2019t her job to do so, part of looking out for Tony was making sure the people he had close were safe. Despite not wanting this job, she\u2019s going to take it seriously and that means going all in. </p><p>It was half an hour later that Tony finally exited the meeting, a group of men all in suits all following behind. Laughing at some joke that must\u2019ve been told, Grace instantly stands and begins to follow the crowd of men. The loud chatter of business and pleasure being apparent, Grace rolled her eyes and followed silently.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see your face in a meeting for once,\u201d Stane chuckled as Tony walked up the car, \u201cI have your assistant here to thank.\u201d He extends a hand to Grace, she smiles tightly and shakes his hand, almost instantly letting go when she could. \u201cLook after this guy, he\u2019s a little wild but don\u2019t let him push you around.\u201d </p><p>Grace nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to.\u201d </p><p>They all get into the car in silence, Happy driving Tony home in silence. Grace sits staring out of the window, her mind preoccupied with a million thoughts. </p><p>\u201cHey, Happy, can you drop me off at the Burger King coming up?\u201d He gives a little nod, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a burger and fries to make it through today.\u201d She mutters mostly to her self, ignoring Tony who is staring at her. </p><p>Tony can survive an hour without her, he\u2019s going home with Happy, who she trusts will, and has been, looking after him. The car pulls into the carpark and Grace gets out, smiling when she sees it\u2019s hardly packed inside. Before she can walk she hears two more car doors open, Tony stepping out along with Happy. Tony doesn\u2019t say anything only starts walking towards the food place, Grace quickly catches up and Happy follows behind. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to one of these since college,\u201d Tony muses and Grace raises an eyebrow. She mostly gets take-out or some form of fast food; late nights at work often meant easy food. Tony steps up, the server looking a tad shocked over Stark ordering food, \u201cWhat do you want Happy?\u201d </p><p>Happy squints as he looks at the menu but instantly says, \u201cI\u2019ll have a Whopper meal, extra large and a diet coke.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, \u201cI imagine that\u2019s a good choice, I\u2019ll have the same.\u201d He then turns his attention to Grace, who just shrugs and gets the same. The server passes three large cups, Tony grabs one of the cups and walks over to the machine and places it under the diet coke one. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Grace amuses, \u201csurprised you remembered how one of these works.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know, contrary to popular belief, I am not that far removed from society.\u201d Tony grabs a straw and begins to sip, watching as Grace adds ice cubes to her own drink. </p><p>Grace gave a disgruntled look, \u201cNo. But you only attended a private boarding school in Europe, where they have \u2018house mothers\u2019, not that far removed at all.\u201d </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve read up on me. I can\u2019t help the fact my dad wanted me gone for the duration of the year.\u201d </p><p>Grace was about to apologise but Happy came over with two trays of food, a big smile on his face. Leading the two of them to a nearby booth, where they sat and started to tear into their food. It\u2019s silent as they eat, a few people taking photos of Tony in Burger King, probably, a little shook up over the fact he\u2019s even dining here. </p><p>\u201cSo, Grace tell me about yourself,\u201d Tony speaks up and looks at her with raised eyebrows, curiosity in his eyes that she hadn\u2019t seen before. </p><p>Grace glances at Happy for a second, \u201cWell, I grew up a tough neighbourhood. I have two older brothers, I don\u2019t see much of them because working - it\u2019s difficult to find off time, you know? My parents divorced when I was seventeen, I haven\u2019t seen my dad since and my mum died when I was nineteen.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods slowly, biting into a fry, \u201cWhat do you do in your spare time?\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckles and raises an eyebrow at Tony, who simply smiles and shrugs. \u201cI do nothing, I have no hobbies or interests. Seriously, I\u2019m a workaholic and I don\u2019t have any friends outside of work because it\u2019s hard to keep them when you have no time for anyone.\u201d It falls silent again, \u201cwhat about you? You must have more friends than just Happy and Pepper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJames Rhodes met him back in college and we have this brotherly-rivalry that has lasted up to now,\u201d Tony smiles and Grace nods, \u201cgood guy, you\u2019d like him actually. He\u2019s very\u2026 responsible and always tries to make me take life seriously.\u201d </p><p>Grace frowns, \u201cYou should take life a little more seriously, Tony.\u201d He only rolls his eyes in response, \u201cYou work and social life, you should take that stuff seriously. It\u2019s gonna come to a point where you\u2019re not gonna know what\u2019s going on in your business, and you\u2019re CEO.\u201d </p><p>It goes back to being silent again, only it\u2019s mutual silence that is sometimes broken by Happy commenting on something. You finish the meal and head back to Tony\u2019s where he goes straight to his workshop, Grace wouldn\u2019t see him for a couple hours now. Deciding to get to work on \u201cemails\u201d, mostly any intel they found on Stane. </p><p><b>**Two days later**</b></p><p>Five days of looking after Stark and it was surprisingly getting easier. Although he still went out and partied a lot, it was much easier to figure out his whereabouts with the tracker she placed in all his shoes. Every move he made, she knew about it. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing?\u201d Grace snapped down the line to Matthews, who had left his vacation early to be in on the mission. \u201cHis assailant is still out there and I\u2019m just one person, Matthews. If anything happens to him\u2026\u201d </p><p>Matthews chuckles down the line, \u201cSounds like you care about this guy.\u201d Grace sighed, rolling her dark eyes, \u201cDo you know if he\u2019s been sent any more threats?\u201d Grace sighs a \u2018no\u2019 down the phone, \u201cseems they\u2019ve gone silent, probably, planning their next move since the helicopter stunt didn\u2019t work. Keep your eye out, Grace. You\u2019re not the only one looking out for him, by the way. Colonel Rhodes made us put more men on security detail, they follow his every move too.\u201d </p><p>Grace let out a sigh of relief, \u201cGood. Just\u2026 keep me updated on everything, got it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bet, don\u2019t get him killed, Hart.\u201d The call ends and Grace sighs heavily.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Grace jumps and swiftly turns to face Tony, \u201con the phone? Who was that? You looked pissed off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust a friend, he\u2019s having trouble at work, like I could help him or something.\u201d Grace snorts with her laugh, high-fiving herself for thinking fast for that lie. </p><p>Tony only nods and chuckles, \u201cOkay. Well, tomorrow you\u2019ll be meeting me and Happy for shopping, I\u2019ve got this Gala thing and I have to attend. I need help on suits, you good at that type of stuff?\u201d </p><p>Grace raised her eyebrows at Tony, he never normally asks for her opinion\u2026 on anything. Maybe these past couples of days, spending most of the day together has meant she\u2019s earnt his trust and approval. He\u2019d normally leave her and have Happy go with him, Happy promising her to keep her updated on everything that\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cUh-sure, I know a bit.\u201d Tony nodded with a half smile, before walking back inside his house. </p><p><b>(The first part can be viewed over on my blog, just scroll down a little bit and you\u2019ll find it or can be found on my That\u2019s Stark\u2019s Boy masterlist.

By all means, it should be easier but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like Tony wants to be killed or something, he\u2019s always attending parties late and bringing home strangers (mostly women). If Tony gets killed whilst she\u2019s on the job, she\u2019ll get fired, Grace knows that because it\u2019s her duty to protect this man.<br></p><p>The schedule given to her is hardly his actual day, he spends most of it down in his work-lab, that she isn\u2019t allowed in or he goes out- requesting she does all the work Pepper usually does. It\u2019s like looking after a child, a child that thinks he\u2019s in charge and can do as he pleases, but yet has responsibilities that he refuses to acknowledge. All it took was two days, two days for Grace to flip. </p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d Grace sternly tells the sleeping Stark, he groans as she commands Jarvis to open his black-out blinds, \u201cyou\u2019re not having me attend <i>YOUR </i>meetings for you, you have to go to them and I\u2019ll come along with you.\u201d </p><p>Tony sits up and rubs his eyes, scowling at the woman before him. Dressed in a lilac blazer, matching pencil skirt and arms crossed. The look reminded Tony one of which his mother used to wear, it made a chill shoot up his spine. A small part of him didn\u2019t believe she was a simple PA, from her steely glare and her eyes always scanning her surroundings. It\u2019s like she was looking for some form of trouble, always on guard and, usually, PA\u2019s don\u2019t have a \u2018fuck off\u2019 attitude. They\u2019re meant to be welcoming and always happy to help and do, yet Grace is different.</p><p>Tony thought better to argue with the woman, deciding to get out of bed and dressed. Grace averted her eyes away as he searched for clothes, throwing on some band tee and jeans. Running his fingers through his hair quickly, turning to Grace with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attending a meeting for a multi-million dollar business,\u201d Grace began, \u201cand you\u2019re attending in a band-tee?\u201d Grace sighed when Tony only shrugged, grabbing a dark navy blazer and throwing that on over it. \u201cwell, hurry up and find some shoes, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Grace walks out of Tony\u2019s bedroom and releases a long sigh, she isn\u2019t scared of him but telling a billionaire what to do or even being stern with him\u2026 felt slightly terrifying. She didn\u2019t want to push her luck and have him fire her, then how is she meant to protect him? 24hr surveillance outside his house? She\u2019s done that before and it killed her back having to sleep in the back of a car.</p><p>Tony exits his room, with a grumpy frown, she would\u2019ve told him to have a shower but they didn\u2019t have enough time, but he still reeked of whatever alcohol he was inducing the night before. The smell of sweat, booze and perfume lingered on his skin, it was a little hard to breathe around him. Grace pulled out a pocket-sized perfume spray, spritzing it on him as they walked to the car. </p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Tony harshly slapped her hand away making her almost drop the perfume. </p><p>\u201cWell if you were a responsible human I wouldn\u2019t be having to spray you just to make you smell, somewhat, lovely.\u201d Grace snaps back, \u201cthank you, Happy.\u201d She kindly smiles at the man she had gotten a little closer with. </p><p>Turns out, Tony would rather drive himself places - when he\u2019s sober, at least- Happy often drives behind Tony being his security detail, they have a close relationship, almost sibling-like. Happy is the only person Grace has come across that has anything nice to say about Stark, apart from the obvious brown-nosers, the people that want something from Tony, Happy seems to really know him and still attests to the fact Tony is a good man. </p><p>The drive is long and silent, \u201cSo\u2026 what is this meeting about?\u201d Grace asked, eyeing Tony from the side and toying with her hands in her lap. </p><p>\u201cJust Stark Industries stuff, future of the company and so forth, you know, we\u2019re making weapons for the government so it\u2019s best to keep on top of legal stuff,\u201d Tony explained and Grace nodded along. \u201cI\u2019m CEO it\u2019s good for me to attend these things, I prefer the little events we do, the testers and reveals of the latest weapons.\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckled slightly, \u201cCEO, really?\u201d Tony only nodded his head, \u201cbut you\u2019re only thirty.\u201d </p><p>He simply shrugs, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Grace held her hands up in defence, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you inherit a company, I was only twenty when my parents died. I wasn\u2019t old enough to run the company, so Obadiah Stane was CEO till I turned twenty-one. He\u2019s been friends of my family for years, he mostly attends the meetings and does all this boring stuff.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been difficult for him to hand over the company back to you,\u201d Tony frowned and looked at Grace, who only shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m just saying being CEO of a company, only for some twenty-one-year-old know-it-all take over. Think I\u2019d go insane,\u201d Grace joked and snorted loudly before calming down. </p><p>They both walked inside the Stark Industries building, Tony nodding \u2018hello\u2019 at a few employees. Grace hung a little behind, feeling a tad out of place. A big part of her praying that she\u2019ll get a phone call saying they caught the guy, that she can stop and go back to her normal desk and be an Agent again. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d A deep voice carries across the building, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for you to turn up.\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes the taller man\u2019s hand, a smile on both of their faces. \u201cYeah, well my temporary personal assistant insisted I attended today.\u201d </p><p>Grace gives a little wave, Stane only nods in her direction before putting an arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and walking him towards the meeting room. In a deep conversation about the company and other things that Grace doesn\u2019t care about, her eyes scan the room of the faces. Anyone of these people could be working for whoever wants to take Stark down, she\u2019d have to remember to get the team to look into every Stark employee. </p><p>It\u2019d be quicker to ask JARVIS but she didn\u2019t want to raise alarm bells to Tony, despite the technology being at her fingertips, she had to be smart about this. Listen to instruction and just keep Tony safe, no searching or prying for the person; priority is Anthony Stark. </p><p>\u201cOh, she can wait out here. Usually, you don\u2019t attend, since you\u2019re here, no one has to take notes.\u201d Stane smiles and leads Tony into the room, shutting it on Grace\u2019s face. </p><p>She scowled at the door for a moment before turning and sitting on a chair, crossing her legs and huffing loudly. She pulled the skirt down a little, grumbling under her breath. She\u2019s used to pant-suits, not skirts and dresses- thankfully, she hasn\u2019t had to wear a dress, yet. Whoever Miss Potts is, she\u2019s a saint, that\u2019s for sure. Having to deal with Tony all day, every day: it\u2019s hard work. Honestly, she couldn\u2019t wait to go back and just do desk duty again. </p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Happy\u2019s voice breaks her out of her mind, she sighs heavily and crosses her arms causing Happy to chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad working for him, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d </p><p>Grace scoffs, \u201cI hope I never have to, I just can\u2019t wait to go back to being an Agent again.\u201d Graces eyes scan over everyone again, \u201chave you done background checks on everyone that works here?\u201d Happy nods, \u201cdo you have any ideas on who could be doing this?\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cThe list of enemies for a Stark is\u2026 long, believe it or not. Being a billionaire kinds puts a bullseye on your back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat about that Stane guy?\u201d Happy scoffs loudly, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cI get a weird vibe from him, especially since he used to be CEO then Tony took over. Imagine putting your life\u2019s work into something, only for the bosses son to get all the glory. \u00a0Plus in the short while, Tony has been CEO here, he\u2019s really made this place flourish. That type of-\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not Stane. He\u2019s been friends with Howard for years, he\u2019s really helped Tony steer this company and lead him. He\u2019s the last person that would want Tony dead.\u201d </p><p>Grace could only nod at what Happy said, yet a gut feeling told her to look into the man. She couldn\u2019t rule anyone out till she checked herself, even though technically it isn\u2019t her job to do so, part of looking out for Tony was making sure the people he had close were safe. Despite not wanting this job, she\u2019s going to take it seriously and that means going all in. </p><p>It was half an hour later that Tony finally exited the meeting, a group of men all in suits all following behind. Laughing at some joke that must\u2019ve been told, Grace instantly stands and begins to follow the crowd of men. The loud chatter of business and pleasure being apparent, Grace rolled her eyes and followed silently.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see your face in a meeting for once,\u201d Stane chuckled as Tony walked up the car, \u201cI have your assistant here to thank.\u201d He extends a hand to Grace, she smiles tightly and shakes his hand, almost instantly letting go when she could. \u201cLook after this guy, he\u2019s a little wild but don\u2019t let him push you around.\u201d </p><p>Grace nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to.\u201d </p><p>They all get into the car in silence, Happy driving Tony home in silence. Grace sits staring out of the window, her mind preoccupied with a million thoughts. </p><p>\u201cHey, Happy, can you drop me off at the Burger King coming up?\u201d He gives a little nod, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a burger and fries to make it through today.\u201d She mutters mostly to her self, ignoring Tony who is staring at her. </p><p>Tony can survive an hour without her, he\u2019s going home with Happy, who she trusts will, and has been, looking after him. The car pulls into the carpark and Grace gets out, smiling when she sees it\u2019s hardly packed inside. Before she can walk she hears two more car doors open, Tony stepping out along with Happy. Tony doesn\u2019t say anything only starts walking towards the food place, Grace quickly catches up and Happy follows behind. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to one of these since college,\u201d Tony muses and Grace raises an eyebrow. She mostly gets take-out or some form of fast food; late nights at work often meant easy food. Tony steps up, the server looking a tad shocked over Stark ordering food, \u201cWhat do you want Happy?\u201d </p><p>Happy squints as he looks at the menu but instantly says, \u201cI\u2019ll have a Whopper meal, extra large and a diet coke.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, \u201cI imagine that\u2019s a good choice, I\u2019ll have the same.\u201d He then turns his attention to Grace, who just shrugs and gets the same. The server passes three large cups, Tony grabs one of the cups and walks over to the machine and places it under the diet coke one. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Grace amuses, \u201csurprised you remembered how one of these works.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know, contrary to popular belief, I am not that far removed from society.\u201d Tony grabs a straw and begins to sip, watching as Grace adds ice cubes to her own drink. </p><p>Grace gave a disgruntled look, \u201cNo. But you only attended a private boarding school in Europe, where they have \u2018house mothers\u2019, not that far removed at all.\u201d </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve read up on me. I can\u2019t help the fact my dad wanted me gone for the duration of the year.\u201d </p><p>Grace was about to apologise but Happy came over with two trays of food, a big smile on his face. Leading the two of them to a nearby booth, where they sat and started to tear into their food. It\u2019s silent as they eat, a few people taking photos of Tony in Burger King, probably, a little shook up over the fact he\u2019s even dining here. </p><p>\u201cSo, Grace tell me about yourself,\u201d Tony speaks up and looks at her with raised eyebrows, curiosity in his eyes that she hadn\u2019t seen before. </p><p>Grace glances at Happy for a second, \u201cWell, I grew up a tough neighbourhood. I have two older brothers, I don\u2019t see much of them because working - it\u2019s difficult to find off time, you know? My parents divorced when I was seventeen, I haven\u2019t seen my dad since and my mum died when I was nineteen.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods slowly, biting into a fry, \u201cWhat do you do in your spare time?\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckles and raises an eyebrow at Tony, who simply smiles and shrugs. \u201cI do nothing, I have no hobbies or interests. Seriously, I\u2019m a workaholic and I don\u2019t have any friends outside of work because it\u2019s hard to keep them when you have no time for anyone.\u201d It falls silent again, \u201cwhat about you? You must have more friends than just Happy and Pepper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJames Rhodes met him back in college and we have this brotherly-rivalry that has lasted up to now,\u201d Tony smiles and Grace nods, \u201cgood guy, you\u2019d like him actually. He\u2019s very\u2026 responsible and always tries to make me take life seriously.\u201d </p><p>Grace frowns, \u201cYou should take life a little more seriously, Tony.\u201d He only rolls his eyes in response, \u201cYou work and social life, you should take that stuff seriously. It\u2019s gonna come to a point where you\u2019re not gonna know what\u2019s going on in your business, and you\u2019re CEO.\u201d </p><p>It goes back to being silent again, only it\u2019s mutual silence that is sometimes broken by Happy commenting on something. You finish the meal and head back to Tony\u2019s where he goes straight to his workshop, Grace wouldn\u2019t see him for a couple hours now. Deciding to get to work on \u201cemails\u201d, mostly any intel they found on Stane. </p><p><b>**Two days later**</b></p><p>Five days of looking after Stark and it was surprisingly getting easier. Although he still went out and partied a lot, it was much easier to figure out his whereabouts with the tracker she placed in all his shoes. Every move he made, she knew about it. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing?\u201d Grace snapped down the line to Matthews, who had left his vacation early to be in on the mission. \u201cHis assailant is still out there and I\u2019m just one person, Matthews. If anything happens to him\u2026\u201d </p><p>Matthews chuckles down the line, \u201cSounds like you care about this guy.\u201d Grace sighed, rolling her dark eyes, \u201cDo you know if he\u2019s been sent any more threats?\u201d Grace sighs a \u2018no\u2019 down the phone, \u201cseems they\u2019ve gone silent, probably, planning their next move since the helicopter stunt didn\u2019t work. Keep your eye out, Grace. You\u2019re not the only one looking out for him, by the way. Colonel Rhodes made us put more men on security detail, they follow his every move too.\u201d </p><p>Grace let out a sigh of relief, \u201cGood. Just\u2026 keep me updated on everything, got it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bet, don\u2019t get him killed, Hart.\u201d The call ends and Grace sighs heavily.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Grace jumps and swiftly turns to face Tony, \u201con the phone? Who was that? You looked pissed off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust a friend, he\u2019s having trouble at work, like I could help him or something.\u201d Grace snorts with her laugh, high-fiving herself for thinking fast for that lie. </p><p>Tony only nods and chuckles, \u201cOkay. Well, tomorrow you\u2019ll be meeting me and Happy for shopping, I\u2019ve got this Gala thing and I have to attend. I need help on suits, you good at that type of stuff?\u201d </p><p>Grace raised her eyebrows at Tony, he never normally asks for her opinion\u2026 on anything. Maybe these past couples of days, spending most of the day together has meant she\u2019s earnt his trust and approval. He\u2019d normally leave her and have Happy go with him, Happy promising her to keep her updated on everything that\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cUh-sure, I know a bit.\u201d Tony nodded with a half smile, before walking back inside his house. </p><p><b>(The first part can be viewed over on my blog, just scroll down a little bit and you\u2019ll find it or can be found on my That\u2019s Stark\u2019s Boy masterlist.

By all means, it should be easier but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like Tony wants to be killed or something, he\u2019s always attending parties late and bringing home strangers (mostly women). If Tony gets killed whilst she\u2019s on the job, she\u2019ll get fired, Grace knows that because it\u2019s her duty to protect this man.<br></p><p>The schedule given to her is hardly his actual day, he spends most of it down in his work-lab, that she isn\u2019t allowed in or he goes out- requesting she does all the work Pepper usually does. It\u2019s like looking after a child, a child that thinks he\u2019s in charge and can do as he pleases, but yet has responsibilities that he refuses to acknowledge. All it took was two days, two days for Grace to flip. </p><p>\u201cGet up.\u201d Grace sternly tells the sleeping Stark, he groans as she commands Jarvis to open his black-out blinds, \u201cyou\u2019re not having me attend <i>YOUR </i>meetings for you, you have to go to them and I\u2019ll come along with you.\u201d </p><p>Tony sits up and rubs his eyes, scowling at the woman before him. Dressed in a lilac blazer, matching pencil skirt and arms crossed. The look reminded Tony one of which his mother used to wear, it made a chill shoot up his spine. A small part of him didn\u2019t believe she was a simple PA, from her steely glare and her eyes always scanning her surroundings. It\u2019s like she was looking for some form of trouble, always on guard and, usually, PA\u2019s don\u2019t have a \u2018fuck off\u2019 attitude. They\u2019re meant to be welcoming and always happy to help and do, yet Grace is different.</p><p>Tony thought better to argue with the woman, deciding to get out of bed and dressed. Grace averted her eyes away as he searched for clothes, throwing on some band tee and jeans. Running his fingers through his hair quickly, turning to Grace with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attending a meeting for a multi-million dollar business,\u201d Grace began, \u201cand you\u2019re attending in a band-tee?\u201d Grace sighed when Tony only shrugged, grabbing a dark navy blazer and throwing that on over it. \u201cwell, hurry up and find some shoes, we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Grace walks out of Tony\u2019s bedroom and releases a long sigh, she isn\u2019t scared of him but telling a billionaire what to do or even being stern with him\u2026 felt slightly terrifying. She didn\u2019t want to push her luck and have him fire her, then how is she meant to protect him? 24hr surveillance outside his house? She\u2019s done that before and it killed her back having to sleep in the back of a car.</p><p>Tony exits his room, with a grumpy frown, she would\u2019ve told him to have a shower but they didn\u2019t have enough time, but he still reeked of whatever alcohol he was inducing the night before. The smell of sweat, booze and perfume lingered on his skin, it was a little hard to breathe around him. Grace pulled out a pocket-sized perfume spray, spritzing it on him as they walked to the car. </p><p>\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Tony harshly slapped her hand away making her almost drop the perfume. </p><p>\u201cWell if you were a responsible human I wouldn\u2019t be having to spray you just to make you smell, somewhat, lovely.\u201d Grace snaps back, \u201cthank you, Happy.\u201d She kindly smiles at the man she had gotten a little closer with. </p><p>Turns out, Tony would rather drive himself places - when he\u2019s sober, at least- Happy often drives behind Tony being his security detail, they have a close relationship, almost sibling-like. Happy is the only person Grace has come across that has anything nice to say about Stark, apart from the obvious brown-nosers, the people that want something from Tony, Happy seems to really know him and still attests to the fact Tony is a good man. </p><p>The drive is long and silent, \u201cSo\u2026 what is this meeting about?\u201d Grace asked, eyeing Tony from the side and toying with her hands in her lap. </p><p>\u201cJust Stark Industries stuff, future of the company and so forth, you know, we\u2019re making weapons for the government so it\u2019s best to keep on top of legal stuff,\u201d Tony explained and Grace nodded along. \u201cI\u2019m CEO it\u2019s good for me to attend these things, I prefer the little events we do, the testers and reveals of the latest weapons.\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckled slightly, \u201cCEO, really?\u201d Tony only nodded his head, \u201cbut you\u2019re only thirty.\u201d </p><p>He simply shrugs, \u201cPlease, don\u2019t remind me.\u201d Grace held her hands up in defence, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you inherit a company, I was only twenty when my parents died. I wasn\u2019t old enough to run the company, so Obadiah Stane was CEO till I turned twenty-one. He\u2019s been friends of my family for years, he mostly attends the meetings and does all this boring stuff.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve been difficult for him to hand over the company back to you,\u201d Tony frowned and looked at Grace, who only shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m just saying being CEO of a company, only for some twenty-one-year-old know-it-all take over. Think I\u2019d go insane,\u201d Grace joked and snorted loudly before calming down. </p><p>They both walked inside the Stark Industries building, Tony nodding \u2018hello\u2019 at a few employees. Grace hung a little behind, feeling a tad out of place. A big part of her praying that she\u2019ll get a phone call saying they caught the guy, that she can stop and go back to her normal desk and be an Agent again. </p><p>\u201cTony?\u201d A deep voice carries across the building, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for you to turn up.\u201d </p><p>Tony shakes the taller man\u2019s hand, a smile on both of their faces. \u201cYeah, well my temporary personal assistant insisted I attended today.\u201d </p><p>Grace gives a little wave, Stane only nods in her direction before putting an arm around Tony\u2019s shoulders and walking him towards the meeting room. In a deep conversation about the company and other things that Grace doesn\u2019t care about, her eyes scan the room of the faces. Anyone of these people could be working for whoever wants to take Stark down, she\u2019d have to remember to get the team to look into every Stark employee. </p><p>It\u2019d be quicker to ask JARVIS but she didn\u2019t want to raise alarm bells to Tony, despite the technology being at her fingertips, she had to be smart about this. Listen to instruction and just keep Tony safe, no searching or prying for the person; priority is Anthony Stark. </p><p>\u201cOh, she can wait out here. Usually, you don\u2019t attend, since you\u2019re here, no one has to take notes.\u201d Stane smiles and leads Tony into the room, shutting it on Grace\u2019s face. </p><p>She scowled at the door for a moment before turning and sitting on a chair, crossing her legs and huffing loudly. She pulled the skirt down a little, grumbling under her breath. She\u2019s used to pant-suits, not skirts and dresses- thankfully, she hasn\u2019t had to wear a dress, yet. Whoever Miss Potts is, she\u2019s a saint, that\u2019s for sure. Having to deal with Tony all day, every day: it\u2019s hard work. Honestly, she couldn\u2019t wait to go back and just do desk duty again. </p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Happy\u2019s voice breaks her out of her mind, she sighs heavily and crosses her arms causing Happy to chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad working for him, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d </p><p>Grace scoffs, \u201cI hope I never have to, I just can\u2019t wait to go back to being an Agent again.\u201d Graces eyes scan over everyone again, \u201chave you done background checks on everyone that works here?\u201d Happy nods, \u201cdo you have any ideas on who could be doing this?\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cThe list of enemies for a Stark is\u2026 long, believe it or not. Being a billionaire kinds puts a bullseye on your back.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat about that Stane guy?\u201d Happy scoffs loudly, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. \u201cI get a weird vibe from him, especially since he used to be CEO then Tony took over. Imagine putting your life\u2019s work into something, only for the bosses son to get all the glory. \u00a0Plus in the short while, Tony has been CEO here, he\u2019s really made this place flourish. That type of-\u201d </p><p>Happy shakes his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not Stane. He\u2019s been friends with Howard for years, he\u2019s really helped Tony steer this company and lead him. He\u2019s the last person that would want Tony dead.\u201d </p><p>Grace could only nod at what Happy said, yet a gut feeling told her to look into the man. She couldn\u2019t rule anyone out till she checked herself, even though technically it isn\u2019t her job to do so, part of looking out for Tony was making sure the people he had close were safe. Despite not wanting this job, she\u2019s going to take it seriously and that means going all in. </p><p>It was half an hour later that Tony finally exited the meeting, a group of men all in suits all following behind. Laughing at some joke that must\u2019ve been told, Grace instantly stands and begins to follow the crowd of men. The loud chatter of business and pleasure being apparent, Grace rolled her eyes and followed silently.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see your face in a meeting for once,\u201d Stane chuckled as Tony walked up the car, \u201cI have your assistant here to thank.\u201d He extends a hand to Grace, she smiles tightly and shakes his hand, almost instantly letting go when she could. \u201cLook after this guy, he\u2019s a little wild but don\u2019t let him push you around.\u201d </p><p>Grace nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to.\u201d </p><p>They all get into the car in silence, Happy driving Tony home in silence. Grace sits staring out of the window, her mind preoccupied with a million thoughts. </p><p>\u201cHey, Happy, can you drop me off at the Burger King coming up?\u201d He gives a little nod, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a burger and fries to make it through today.\u201d She mutters mostly to her self, ignoring Tony who is staring at her. </p><p>Tony can survive an hour without her, he\u2019s going home with Happy, who she trusts will, and has been, looking after him. The car pulls into the carpark and Grace gets out, smiling when she sees it\u2019s hardly packed inside. Before she can walk she hears two more car doors open, Tony stepping out along with Happy. Tony doesn\u2019t say anything only starts walking towards the food place, Grace quickly catches up and Happy follows behind. </p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to one of these since college,\u201d Tony muses and Grace raises an eyebrow. She mostly gets take-out or some form of fast food; late nights at work often meant easy food. Tony steps up, the server looking a tad shocked over Stark ordering food, \u201cWhat do you want Happy?\u201d </p><p>Happy squints as he looks at the menu but instantly says, \u201cI\u2019ll have a Whopper meal, extra large and a diet coke.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods, \u201cI imagine that\u2019s a good choice, I\u2019ll have the same.\u201d He then turns his attention to Grace, who just shrugs and gets the same. The server passes three large cups, Tony grabs one of the cups and walks over to the machine and places it under the diet coke one. </p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Grace amuses, \u201csurprised you remembered how one of these works.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou know, contrary to popular belief, I am not that far removed from society.\u201d Tony grabs a straw and begins to sip, watching as Grace adds ice cubes to her own drink. </p><p>Grace gave a disgruntled look, \u201cNo. But you only attended a private boarding school in Europe, where they have \u2018house mothers\u2019, not that far removed at all.\u201d </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow, \u201cSo, you\u2019ve read up on me. I can\u2019t help the fact my dad wanted me gone for the duration of the year.\u201d </p><p>Grace was about to apologise but Happy came over with two trays of food, a big smile on his face. Leading the two of them to a nearby booth, where they sat and started to tear into their food. It\u2019s silent as they eat, a few people taking photos of Tony in Burger King, probably, a little shook up over the fact he\u2019s even dining here. </p><p>\u201cSo, Grace tell me about yourself,\u201d Tony speaks up and looks at her with raised eyebrows, curiosity in his eyes that she hadn\u2019t seen before. </p><p>Grace glances at Happy for a second, \u201cWell, I grew up a tough neighbourhood. I have two older brothers, I don\u2019t see much of them because working - it\u2019s difficult to find off time, you know? My parents divorced when I was seventeen, I haven\u2019t seen my dad since and my mum died when I was nineteen.\u201d </p><p>Tony nods slowly, biting into a fry, \u201cWhat do you do in your spare time?\u201d </p><p>Grace chuckles and raises an eyebrow at Tony, who simply smiles and shrugs. \u201cI do nothing, I have no hobbies or interests. Seriously, I\u2019m a workaholic and I don\u2019t have any friends outside of work because it\u2019s hard to keep them when you have no time for anyone.\u201d It falls silent again, \u201cwhat about you? You must have more friends than just Happy and Pepper.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJames Rhodes met him back in college and we have this brotherly-rivalry that has lasted up to now,\u201d Tony smiles and Grace nods, \u201cgood guy, you\u2019d like him actually. He\u2019s very\u2026 responsible and always tries to make me take life seriously.\u201d </p><p>Grace frowns, \u201cYou should take life a little more seriously, Tony.\u201d He only rolls his eyes in response, \u201cYou work and social life, you should take that stuff seriously. It\u2019s gonna come to a point where you\u2019re not gonna know what\u2019s going on in your business, and you\u2019re CEO.\u201d </p><p>It goes back to being silent again, only it\u2019s mutual silence that is sometimes broken by Happy commenting on something. You finish the meal and head back to Tony\u2019s where he goes straight to his workshop, Grace wouldn\u2019t see him for a couple hours now. Deciding to get to work on \u201cemails\u201d, mostly any intel they found on Stane. </p><p><b>**Two days later**</b></p><p>Five days of looking after Stark and it was surprisingly getting easier. Although he still went out and partied a lot, it was much easier to figure out his whereabouts with the tracker she placed in all his shoes. Every move he made, she knew about it. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing?\u201d Grace snapped down the line to Matthews, who had left his vacation early to be in on the mission. \u201cHis assailant is still out there and I\u2019m just one person, Matthews. If anything happens to him\u2026\u201d </p><p>Matthews chuckles down the line, \u201cSounds like you care about this guy.\u201d Grace sighed, rolling her dark eyes, \u201cDo you know if he\u2019s been sent any more threats?\u201d Grace sighs a \u2018no\u2019 down the phone, \u201cseems they\u2019ve gone silent, probably, planning their next move since the helicopter stunt didn\u2019t work. Keep your eye out, Grace. You\u2019re not the only one looking out for him, by the way. Colonel Rhodes made us put more men on security detail, they follow his every move too.\u201d </p><p>Grace let out a sigh of relief, \u201cGood. Just\u2026 keep me updated on everything, got it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou bet, don\u2019t get him killed, Hart.\u201d The call ends and Grace sighs heavily.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Grace jumps and swiftly turns to face Tony, \u201con the phone? Who was that? You looked pissed off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust a friend, he\u2019s having trouble at work, like I could help him or something.\u201d Grace snorts with her laugh, high-fiving herself for thinking fast for that lie. </p><p>Tony only nods and chuckles, \u201cOkay. Well, tomorrow you\u2019ll be meeting me and Happy for shopping, I\u2019ve got this Gala thing and I have to attend. I need help on suits, you good at that type of stuff?\u201d </p><p>Grace raised her eyebrows at Tony, he never normally asks for her opinion\u2026 on anything. Maybe these past couples of days, spending most of the day together has meant she\u2019s earnt his trust and approval. He\u2019d normally leave her and have Happy go with him, Happy promising her to keep her updated on everything that\u2019s happening. </p><p>\u201cUh-sure, I know a bit.\u201d Tony nodded with a half smile, before walking back inside his house. </p><p><b>(The first part can be viewed over on my blog, just scroll down a little bit and you\u2019ll find it or can be found on my That\u2019s Stark\u2019s Boy masterlist.

By all means, it should be easier but it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s like Tony wants to be killed or something, he&rsquo;s always attending parties late and bringing home strangers (mostly women). If Tony gets killed whilst she&rsquo;s on the job, she&rsquo;ll get fired, Grace knows that because it&rsquo;s her duty to protect this man.<br /></p><p>The schedule given to her is hardly his actual day, he spends most of it down in his work-lab, that she isn&rsquo;t allowed in or he goes out- requesting she does all the work Pepper usually does. It&rsquo;s like looking after a child, a child that thinks he&rsquo;s in charge and can do as he pleases, but yet has responsibilities that he refuses to acknowledge. All it took was two days, two days for Grace to flip. </p><p>&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; Grace sternly tells the sleeping Stark, he groans as she commands Jarvis to open his black-out blinds, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not having me attend <i>YOUR </i>meetings for you, you have to go to them and I&rsquo;ll come along with you.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony sits up and rubs his eyes, scowling at the woman before him.

Grace sits staring out of the window, her mind preoccupied with a million thoughts. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Happy, can you drop me off at the Burger King coming up?&rdquo; He gives a little nod, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna need a burger and fries to make it through today.&rdquo; She mutters mostly to her self, ignoring Tony who is staring at her. </p><p>Tony can survive an hour without her, he&rsquo;s going home with Happy, who she trusts will, and has been, looking after him. The car pulls into the carpark and Grace gets out, smiling when she sees it&rsquo;s hardly packed inside. Before she can walk she hears two more car doors open, Tony stepping out along with Happy. Tony doesn&rsquo;t say anything only starts walking towards the food place, Grace quickly catches up and Happy follows behind. </p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been to one of these since college,&rdquo; Tony muses and Grace raises an eyebrow. She mostly gets take-out or some form of fast food; late nights at work often meant easy food. Tony steps up, the server looking a tad shocked over Stark ordering food, &ldquo;What do you want Happy?&rdquo; </p><p>Happy squints as he looks at the menu but instantly says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a Whopper meal, extra large and a diet coke.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods, &ldquo;I imagine that&rsquo;s a good choice, I&rsquo;ll have the same.&rdquo; He then turns his attention to Grace, who just shrugs and gets the same. The server passes three large cups, Tony grabs one of the cups and walks over to the machine and places it under the diet coke one. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Grace amuses, &ldquo;surprised you remembered how one of these works.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You know, contrary to popular belief, I am not that far removed from society.&rdquo; Tony grabs a straw and begins to sip, watching as Grace adds ice cubes to her own drink. </p><p>Grace gave a disgruntled look, &ldquo;No. But you only attended a private boarding school in Europe, where they have &lsquo;house mothers&rsquo;, not that far removed at all.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony raised an eyebrow, &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;ve read up on me. I can&rsquo;t help the fact my dad wanted me gone for the duration of the year.&rdquo; </p><p>Grace was about to apologise but Happy came over with two trays of food, a big smile on his face. Leading the two of them to a nearby booth, where they sat and started to tear into their food. It&rsquo;s silent as they eat, a few people taking photos of Tony in Burger King, probably, a little shook up over the fact he&rsquo;s even dining here. </p><p>&ldquo;So, Grace tell me about yourself,&rdquo; Tony speaks up and looks at her with raised eyebrows, curiosity in his eyes that she hadn&rsquo;t seen before. </p><p>Grace glances at Happy for a second, &ldquo;Well, I grew up a tough neighbourhood. I have two older brothers, I don&rsquo;t see much of them because working - it&rsquo;s difficult to find off time, you know? My parents divorced when I was seventeen, I haven&rsquo;t seen my dad since and my mum died when I was nineteen.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony nods slowly, biting into a fry, &ldquo;What do you do in your spare time?&rdquo; </p><p>Grace chuckles and raises an eyebrow at Tony, who simply smiles and shrugs. &ldquo;I do nothing, I have no hobbies or interests. Seriously, I&rsquo;m a workaholic and I don&rsquo;t have any friends outside of work because it&rsquo;s hard to keep them when you have no time for anyone.&rdquo; It falls silent again, &ldquo;what about you? You must have more friends than just Happy and Pepper.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;James Rhodes met him back in college and we have this brotherly-rivalry that has lasted up to now,&rdquo; Tony smiles and Grace nods, &ldquo;good guy, you&rsquo;d like him actually. He&rsquo;s very&hellip; responsible and always tries to make me take life seriously.&rdquo; </p><p>Grace frowns, &ldquo;You should take life a little more seriously, Tony.&rdquo; He only rolls his eyes in response, &ldquo;You work and social life, you should take that stuff seriously. It&rsquo;s gonna come to a point where you&rsquo;re not gonna know what&rsquo;s going on in your business, and you&rsquo;re CEO.&rdquo; </p><p>It goes back to being silent again, only it&rsquo;s mutual silence that is sometimes broken by Happy commenting on something. You finish the meal and head back to Tony&rsquo;s where he goes straight to his workshop, Grace wouldn&rsquo;t see him for a couple hours now. Deciding to get to work on &ldquo;emails&rdquo;, mostly any intel they found on Stane. </p><p><b>**Two days later**</b></p><p>Five days of looking after Stark and it was surprisingly getting easier. Although he still went out and partied a lot, it was much easier to figure out his whereabouts with the tracker she placed in all his shoes. Every move he made, she knew about it. </p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean there&rsquo;s nothing?&rdquo; Grace snapped down the line to Matthews, who had left his vacation early to be in on the mission. &ldquo;His assailant is still out there and I&rsquo;m just one person, Matthews. If anything happens to him&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Matthews chuckles down the line, &ldquo;Sounds like you care about this guy.&rdquo; Grace sighed, rolling her dark eyes, &ldquo;Do you know if he&rsquo;s been sent any more threats?&rdquo; Grace sighs a &lsquo;no&rsquo; down the phone, &ldquo;seems they&rsquo;ve gone silent, probably, planning their next move since the helicopter stunt didn&rsquo;t work. Keep your eye out, Grace. You&rsquo;re not the only one looking out for him, by the way. Colonel Rhodes made us put more men on security detail, they follow his every move too.&rdquo; </p><p>Grace let out a sigh of relief, &ldquo;Good. Just&hellip; keep me updated on everything, got it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You bet, don&rsquo;t get him killed, Hart.&rdquo; The call ends and Grace sighs heavily.</p><p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Grace jumps and swiftly turns to face Tony, &ldquo;on the phone? Who was that? You looked pissed off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just a friend, he&rsquo;s having trouble at work, like I could help him or something.&rdquo; Grace snorts with her laugh, high-fiving herself for thinking fast for that lie. </p><p>Tony only nods and chuckles, &ldquo;Okay. Well, tomorrow you&rsquo;ll be meeting me and Happy for shopping, I&rsquo;ve got this Gala thing and I have to attend. I need help on suits, you good at that type of stuff?&rdquo; </p><p>Grace raised her eyebrows at Tony, he never normally asks for her opinion&hellip; on anything. Maybe these past couples of days, spending most of the day together has meant she&rsquo;s earnt his trust and approval. He&rsquo;d normally leave her and have Happy go with him, Happy promising her to keep her updated on everything that&rsquo;s happening. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh-sure, I know a bit.&rdquo; Tony nodded with a half smile, before walking back inside his house. </p><p><b>(The first part can be viewed over on my blog, just scroll down a little bit and you&rsquo;ll find it or can be found on my That&rsquo;s Stark&rsquo;s Boy masterlist. Let me know what you think about this, thank you - Rosalie)</b></p>",
