Taking the lead his arm nudged you to the right. \u201cYour\nhealing abilities could do wonders for my people. One of our main principles is\nto capture and cleanse any with traits unworthy of our people and those useful\nto us are claimed.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you asked, \u201cClaimed how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are extracted through blood or removal of limbs. Others\nrequire more primitive attempts for carrying on in our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning breeding?\u201d He nodded and you let out a weak giggle,\n\u201cSo I take it had I a great number for my race they would be captured by\nyours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d His eyes lingered on you watching your smirk\ngrow, \u201cThe thought amuses you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am wondering how many races have been stolen by yours\nto form the ones I have encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a race since the mortals a few thousand\nyears back. The Asguardians seemed to grow irritated with it. We abandoned our\nstudies when the hassle outweighed the progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him with a soft giggle then shook your head\nmaking him look you over, focusing on your curves mainly in an attempt to inspect\nyour breathing. Only to lose his train of thought until your hand on his arm\nbrought his focus back to the present just a few inches from a wall just a foot\nfrom the hall he had been leading you to. In a side step to your right he did\nthe same felling a sting at your hand leaving his arm. The open mess hall ahead\nmade your step pause when the sea of blue heads turned to you each sending\nrespectful bows of their head between Kreeish growls of your title as Ronan\u2019s\nKeeper. Through the room Ronan led you to the end of the line asking, \u201cWhat did\nyou wish to eat. You may have your fill of anything we can supply.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him after eyeing the odd long supply of\nfoods you could not identify, \u201cYou can pick for me.\u201d</p><p>He looked you over then faced forward listing a supply of food\nbefore reaching down and claiming your hand to lead you at his side to his\ntable, also claiming one of the silver cups set on the window opening\nseparating you from the food the others accepted their trays through. You\naccepted the other cup and raised it higher to give it a curious whiff while\nKorath and Gamora placed their orders and accepted their trays. A table in an\nalcove atop a couple steps came into view on your left. Extending his arm he\nguided you up first to claim one of the seats while he accepted the other at\nyour side through a pair of Kree approaching to set plates of tall piles of\nfood in front of you along with a set of spoons.</p><p>Looking you over in their step back he asked, \u201cYou do not\napprove of your drink?\u201d</p><p>Your head turned to look at him, \u201cIt smells like mangoes.\u201d\nRaising it to your lips you blinked through your sip as other Kree in the mess\nhall within sight eyed your reaction. In a stoic face you lowered the\nsurprisingly hot mixture tasting nothing like mangoes, more like green beans\nmixed with honey glazed ham strangely enough. \u201cHmm. Definitely not mangoes.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at him after he had taken a sip of his darker\ndrink choice reeking of melted butter on toast that darkened his teeth coating\nit in a thin black layer of liquid<b>,\n\u201cRoob.\u201d</b> He named his drink in Kreeish at your curious glance in his cup.\n\u201cFor our warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour teeth.\u201d After a pause you asked, \u201cDoes mine change my\nteeth?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, \u201cNo. <b>Gref</b>\ndoes not have those effects. We give it to our Children and Keepers to build\ntheir health on our ships.\u201d</p><p>You raised a brow, \u201cI am in need of building then?\u201d</p><p>He eased his eyes over your face taking in your playful glint\nin your eyes Gamora and Korath missed in their claiming the table behind you\nwith oddly yellow drinks you were too far from to smell you eyed curiously,\n\u201cYou do not want <b>Nrog</b>.\u201d You turned\nto look at him again, \u201cIt is poison to most races. We supply it for only them,\nto counter the toxins Thanos unleashed in their bodies. Grants them time to\nremain among us before having to return to him for the antidote.\u201d</p><p>Turning again you asked Gamora, \u201cDoes Nebula need that?\u201d</p><p>Gamora looked to her glass then shook her head, \u201cNo. She does\nnot need it. We can survive days without it.\u201d</p><p>A snap of your fingers later Nebula dropped heavily with legs\ncrossed jolting her awake to look you over then jump up with dagger drawn until\nyou stated, \u201cYou should eat.\u201d</p><p>Angrily she scowled at you, \u201cI do not require sustenance for\nweeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick. Eat something, drink your medicine.\u201d</p><p>At this she growled, \u201cI do not take orders from the likes of you!\u201d\n</p><p>Around her the Kree halted and Ronan lowered his glass only to\nremain still at your crossed leg moving to rest against his through his\ngrowling out in Kreeish, \u201c<b>Kneel or fall</b>.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned to you, \u201cI am not in need of sustenance, and I\nwill not respect any who show weakness at the suffering of others!\u201d</p><p>With a smile you lowered your glass from a sip of the odd\nliquid, \u201cYour respect has little value for me.\u201d Those words made her lips part\nand the Kree grow silent as they took in what you had missed as the worst sort\nof insult to their kind marking her even below the worth of a servant, marking\nher as a waste of being in their translation. \u201cLife really sucks. I know what\nyou have suffered, and suffer from still. Eat, drink, feel better. When you\nshow me something useful in your book of tricks past being Thanos\u2019 play thing\nthen we can bring up respect again.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply she blinked then seemingly had to jerk her\nbody into moving to turn and claim her place in line through the Kree stealing\nsmirking glances at you as Ronan nipped at his lower lip to contain his pleased\ngrin and raised his spoon from the table. In his first scoop your eyes turned\nto his food as you claimed your own spoon to fill. Curiously you tasted the\nbland yet scalding hot rice like food, eating it stoically until the next\nspoonful that was a jolt of spices and somehow freezing cold. Each bite grew\nmore intriguing until you cleared your plate and finished your drink somehow\nspreading Ronan\u2019s grin at your taking to the food so well and being able to\nfinish the large supply so easily.</p><p>Again you were on your feet when two Kree arrived to clear\nyour table. Through the mess hall you felt all eyes on you with pleased smirks\non the faces of the dispersing Warriors all returning to their own quarters and\nposts to either dress or report for duties. Glancing up at him you asked, \u201cWhat\ndo you have planned for today?\u201d</p><p>Curiously he blinked at you trying to pinpoint just what\nemotions you were feeling. The jumble of pleasure and intrigue washed through\nhim at once, \u201cWhat did you wish for me to do?\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to disturb your duties. I\nimagine you\u2019ve a great deal to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Playfully you replied, \u201cNo it can\u2019t.\u201d When you reached your\ndoor you tapped the knot by the door on the wall opening the door you passed\nthrough walking backwards, \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man. Don\u2019t mind me, plenty to keep me\noccupied.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he stepped inside with the door closing behind him\nto follow you into the bathroom where he watched you set your makeup bag on the\ncounter by the sink where you had set up a tall mirror. A small dab of eye\nprimer was added to your pinky finger and smoothed on your upper eye lid before\nanother was applied to the other. \u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make a stop in a Korna.\u201d Making his lips part,\n\u201cUnless you disapprove.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lowered to watch you draw out your eye liner and add\na sleek line around your upper lid, \u201cI am going with you if you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you have the time? I don\u2019t want to take you\nfrom your crew if they need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you alone ever. Especially on Korna.\u201d He\nshifted to peek in your bag eyeing the eye shadow you chose from after\noutlining your other eye. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Korna, I\u2019ve been there dozens of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire planet is filled with scavengers and vagabonds.\nNowhere near worthy of your visit. What business do you have there?\u201d</p><p>In a glance at him you let out a weak giggle saying, \u201cI\nsuppose you would only feel comfortable leaving me with your crew then. After\nall, they are just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were true I would not be their commander.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk you opened the square of pale silver to peach eye\nshadows with brush in hand, \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant, and you should leave.\u201d His\nbrow rose but he did not move, watching you smooth three shades above your eye,\n\u201cUnless you want to go dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>Flatly he replied, \u201cI will require my armor. We do not have\nallies on Korna.\u201d</p><p>With a final swipe of your brush you put them away saying,\n\u201cMarshmallow it is then.\u201d</p><p>In your path to your bedroom again he watched as you pulled\noff your shorts, eyeing the curves the hems of your panties hugged and\naccentuated so perfectly almost drawing a growl from him in his struggle not to\ncross the room to you. Your bend over to dig out a pair of jeans and socks only\nworsening things. In place he stood as you pulled on your socks then bounced\ninto your jeans you added your belt to the loops at the waistband. When you\nglanced up at him you bent to grab your converse and your flannel shirt.</p><p>You crossed the room to him spotting his hungry eyes looking\nyou over then all but smirking openly when your hand planted on his upper arm\nguiding him to turn towards the door. In a low growl he repeated,\n\u201cMarshmallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour alias, remember? First, you need shoes at least.\u201d Your hand\ndropped and he hit the knot on the wall by your door leading you out into the\nhall as you pulled on your flannel.\u00a0</p><p>In his room you stood by the door pulling\non your converse and tied them and stood watching as he grabbed his under shirt\nand chest plate. The slow rippling of his back in his easing the sleeves of his\nshirt over his arms and head through the neck hole almost making him freeze at\nthe rush of an almost starving lust coming from you in your inspection of him.\nThe layer dropped over his back and he turned hearing your steps closer to him.\nThrough a broken inhale his eyes watched as you claimed his chest plate and\nhelped him settle it over his torso before he tightened the sides.</p><p>In a searching gaze over your face you grabbed his socks he\u2019d\nset aside and held them between you signaling his hand to rise and claim them\nin his wonder at your now muddled blur of emotions poorly hiding under the\nremaining cloud of lust, making sure to glide his fingers against yours in\nclaiming the pair he pulled on before bending to add his boots.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"leepace71:e55eYxwOC3VjbUjm7RulPg:ZicWDo2dkg44M\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5de02c2b672e5acb5d3b9675a0e323/tumblr_pi69opql6B1tugymxo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p>Upright again\nhe watched your amused glint in your eyes as his appearance shifted back to the\njean and smurf t shirt wearing doppelganger with scruff and shaggy hair, \u201cFor\nthe record, I despise this disguise.\u201d</p><p>Your smile and soft giggle came with your saying, \u201cStop being\nso cute. You know you enjoy hiding.\u201d Before he could say anything you were both\ntransported in the center of a bustling city packed with grime coated\ndilapidated towers around you on a packed street full of passing sneers and\ndiscerning glares at you and Ronan. Firmly his hand claimed yours in your\nguiding him through the street as a voice shouted out in Nian, <b>\u201cHow about you\nmake me?!\u201d </b></p><p>His grip tightened with each block you passed as creature\nafter creature eyed you both in disappointment at the lack of any valuables to\nsteal. In a lean down he growled close to your ear almost dropping himself to\nhis knees at the allured response it drew in you, \u201cNext time-.\u201d</p><p>At once his voice broke off and his eyes dropped hungrily to\nyour lips just inches from his, \u201cFew more minutes then we can get back to your\nship. Next time will be simpler.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he eyed your figure in your turn to guide him around\nthe corner and down the next alley where he let out another growl in your\nentering the first beaded string coated doorway on your left. Under furrowed\nbrows he eyed the seedy shop around you with row after row of wooden slat\nformed benches packed with obscure items and weapons. A single glance at you a\nDark Elf left the shop at the sight of you mumbling, \u201cI am out of here.\u201d\nGrabbing his small honking winged lizard from the ground beside him he mumbled\nto, \u201cWe have a schedule to keep.\u201d</p><p>On his path out however he paused smirking at the small twig\nlike object you drew from your pocket and offered to the lizard that gleefully\nate it while his owner thanked you for the lizard\u2019s favorite treat on his\nbirthday, to which you answered, \u201cOf course I remembered his favorite!\u201d</p><p>Quietly the Elf left and you looked back to the displays as\nRonan lowly asked, \u201cFriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him, \u201cThe Cropiscaner yes. Never met the Elf\nbefore. They demand the treat each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly do you befriend a Cropiscaner? They are notorious\nfor attacking villages. Full herds have been known to send full planets into collapse.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cPicked him up on Troufless before it exploded.\nThor really didn\u2019t trust him, but if you had to choose between an exploding\nplanet or a ship with creatures that could kill you even the worst of the worst\ncould agree to get along.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cTrue.\u201d In another scanning look over you he asked,\n\u201cHow close to the worst of the worst would you consider Kree to be?\u201d</p><p>With a giggle you peered up at him catching his darkening eyes\nlowering to your lips again, \u201cI would never consider the Kree to be the worst,\nat anything.\u201d</p><p>Your answer drawing a smirk across his lips in your turn and\nstep away to continue your browsing in a determined step and lean forward he\ngrowled lowly beside your ear. \u201cFlirtation does not excuse my desire,\u201d his eyes\ntraveled over your neck at the row of bumps rising over your skin through the\nnext wave of your emotions coursed through his body and burned in his veins,\n\u201cFor an answer.\u201d</p><p>Just as soon as he\u2019d finished his sentence you turned easing\nyour lips just barely a breath from his urging a clear low growling exhale from\nhim in his attempt to announce his sheer invitation for any contact from you. \u201cJust\nwhat are you accusing me of?\u201d His eyes lowered to your lips in your step back\nto give his hand a tug after your finger tapping just under his chin in what\nyou missed as an all but promised contact later making him smirk again after a nip at his lip.</p><p>Three benches later he peered over your shoulder stealing a\nteasing brush of his free hand\u2019s fingers along the strip of skin\non your hip under your shirts when you reached for an crudely carved statue barely a few inches\nlong. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>You giggled softly saying, \u201cFrom Morag. Part of my nursery.\u201d\nHe nodded and followed you to the counter where the tentacle faced man eyed the\nstatue then you both then smirked at the bag of peppermints you drew from your\nenchanted pouch in your pocket and passed it to him as he handed you the statue\nin a small velvet pouch he slid it into. </p><p>With traded smirks you pocketed your goods and you led the\nshielded warrior through the alley again as he asked, \u201cWas that all you\nneeded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another planet nearby if you don\u2019t mind another\nstop.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNot at all. Wherever you need to go I will\nescort you.\u201d</p><p>Locking your eyes with his purple glowing pair you asked, \u201cHow\nbusy are your days if you can just spend all day following me around.\u201d Unable\nto help it his smirk deepened as you added, \u201cI just picture you lounging about\nbetween chosen destinations now with your men listening to your tales of Kree Warriors of old.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>A pop later the world changed to a desert coated planet you\nlanded on the outskirt of a small town in the center of nowhere with small\nfabric tents across from a stone formed city in the distance. Under foot the\nsand shifted awkwardly as Ronan walked beside you through the nothingness.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that arrow shaped column ahead?\u201d He nodded, \u201cJust past\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are we searching for?\u201d Adjusting his hand to fit\nmore around yours after your unsteady foot sliding off a tipping rock making\nyou bump into his side. \u201cAnother statue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat use could that statue be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone, not much to the unknowing eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d</p><p>You let out a weak giggle, \u201cMy Father left me gifts to find,\nshould I need them. But with Thanos running about it\u2019s best I gather them first\nbefore he tries to steal any of them again.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cThanos tried to steal one of your statues?\u201d</p><p>You shook you head, \u201cNo, my tesseract.\u201d Ronan\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>\u201cThe tesseract is yours?\u201d</p><p>You nodded then glanced up at him, \u201cTechnically the case is\nAsguardian but what it is holding, powering the cube is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Loki stole the tesseract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came to an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour marriage.\u201d</p><p>You let out a stunned giggle drawing his eyes from the blowing\nsand obstructing the path ahead to you, \u201cNo. A ride home to safety in exchange\nfor tabs on Thanos.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cYou were Loki\u2019s puppet master then.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cWe prefer ally. Heard him in passing\nwhen Frigga sent out word he fell from the Bifrost. She guaranteed the safety\nof my tesseract, I wasn\u2019t about to let her Son vanish into the vacuum of space.\nThanos found him, but not until after he heard my whisper in his ear of his\nMother\u2019s promise.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cHow did marriage come about then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been declared dead a couple times. Needed a place to\nhide. Nowhere near as obstinate as his Brother would lead others to assume.\u201d In\nanother glance up at Ronan you smirked, \u201cJust like you. So very agreeable for a\nconqueror of worlds. A welcome change, usually I tend to get trapped with\nothers like Nebula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for you to be harmed.\u201d</p><p>You smirked again, \u201cOnly a simple hostage trade right?\u201d</p><p>Another squeeze came around your hand, \u201cYou are not my\nhostage.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle you replied, \u201cOh yes. You only have no intention of letting\nme out of your sight ever again, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is only fitting. Healing my Mother has aided my people in\nways you cannot grasp just yet. I would be foolish to repay that by leaving you\nunprotected.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you smirked, \u201cWho says I\u2019m not the one\nprotecting you for something, hmm?\u201d As you looked forward his lips parted and\nthe thought raced through his mind running through the validity of your\nsuggestion, leaving him to wonder just what it could be and how you letting him\ntake you could fit into a plan to protect him.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly an hour later your sneaker hit a thick rock in your hop\nup out of the sand into the rocky climb ahead leading to the arrow shaped rock.\nTenderly his fingers brushed along your palm releasing your hands to aid in\nyour climbing, he hopped up behind you and wet his lips as he pulled himself up\nover another large boulder after you. Around a winding jagged path you trekked\nand walked until he watched you kneel at the base of the rock feature. At the\nbase you shifted a sand covered chunk of amber and dug out a trio of velvet\nwrapped statues you pocketed with the other in your enchanted pouch after Ronan\ngave the trio a curious once over. \u201cThey look like game pieces.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk at him you said, \u201cIn a way they are.\u201d The amber\nwas buried again and you climbed down after your glance up at the yellow sky as\nthe green sun rose to claim the sinking blue sun\u2019s position summoning a wall of\ndust on the horizon. Looking towards the stone city you stated, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to\nstay the night.\u201d He eyed the same wall of dust in the start of your climb as\nyou stated, \u201cThe green sun only makes the air thinner, I zap us out of here\nit\u2019ll ignite.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI take it you have allies here as well for\nshelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. But I do have some parsnip seeds.\u201d He looked at you\nwhen you jumped down to the sand you sunk in to your ankles. He jumped down\nbeside you and shook each foot free just as you did in your path to the city in\nthe distance.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you travel? Barter your way through the\nuniverse?\u201d</p><p>You giggled again, \u201cWell not all of us have a fleet of blue\nwarriors willing to tear through planets at our beck and call as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d</p><p>With another giggle you replied, \u201cDo not promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cYou should probably read through my\nlist of enemies before you go promising me that. I doubt you would after giving\nit a read. More than a few of your allies I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Ronan\u2019s chin tilted and his eyes fell to your hand again,\n\u201cKree do not collect allies.\u201d </p><p>His eyes looked you over as you said, \u201cWell consider yourself\nthe exception.\u201d</p><p>He smirked as he stated, \u201cI did not collect you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cNope you just kidnap yours.\u201d Giggling again as\nyour eyes met then broke apart as you faced the city again.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly halfway the temperature dropped as you passed through\nwhat felt to be a icy barrier marking the shift from sand to brittle broken\ngrey earth surrounded by jagged half buried stones. Across a frozen lake you\ncrossed with your hand locked in Ronan\u2019s holding him steady on the climb up\nonto the broken bridge to enter the city just as a blast of frigid icy air blew\nstraight at you. In a shift closer to you Ronan asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people train to withstand great climate shifts.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle as the wind picked up you replied, \u201cSo that\u2019s a\nyes, you\u2019re just too stubborn to admit it.\u201d Making him smirk at your back as\nyou led the way through the city.</p><p>Winding streets later past the surprisingly hundreds of\nscantily clad species between the bundled rarities of visitors eyed you both\ncuriously as the only humanoids in sight until Ronan paused watching your fist\nraise and crash loudly into the metal door at the base of a jagged tower wall\nwith a growing sheet of ice forming on it. Roughly a voice in a tongue he did\nnot recognize called out, <b>\u201cGo away!\u201d</b></p><p>Harshly you shouted back over the growing wind, <b>\u201cNaq, you will\nopen this door!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo vacancy!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come over there myself! I will break your door\ndown!\u201d</b></p><p>A shuffling was heard through the metal, <b>\u201cNo room!\u201d</b></p><p>You nodded, <b>\u201cMore Parsnip seeds for myself then!\u201d</b></p><p>At that a hidden slot on the door opened revealing twelve eyes\non the end of shifting stalks appeared peering at you both as the voice called\nback, <b>\u201cThere is only one bed.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cOpen the door.\u201d</b></p><p>The slot was shut and the door was cracked signaling the\ncrowds around you to halt and dart towards the door, only to fall at the cracks\nin the walls from above opened revealing a set of rotating barrels on a gun\nshooting out spikes at each that dared enter but you and Ronan. The floating\norb of eyes coiled up behind the door you and Ronan slammed then bolted shut\nagain behind you. The warmly lit room grew when you turned to face the\nexpanding orb that turned from a sickly grey to its dark green shade in the\nwarmth again.</p><p>You dug in your pocket for the seeds half of the eyes scanned\nover until you passed the small vial into the tentacle extended for it after it\nstopped in front of the doorway to the room you were offered. Curiously Ronan\nlooked it over as the gleefully popping orb floated to his greenhouse down the\nhall to plant three of the seeds and save the rest for later. As you sat at the\nfoot of the bed Ronan lit the fire in the room before moving to close the door\nleaving you alone again finally then turned to sit beside you to remove his\nboots. </p><p>Before he could say anything he turned his head seeing the\npurple veins showing through your skin under the flannel shirt you set aside\nthen stood. In a deep growl he stated, \u201cYou\u2019re injured!\u201d</p><p>You glanced back at him, \u201cNo. It\u2019s, hard to explain. It\u2019s an\neffect from the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re harming you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m shielding their power until we return to your ship.\u201d\nYou moved to the water basin in the wall fed from a small fountain feeding\nthrough to the wall into the greenhouse next door. Gingerly you smoothed the\nwarm water over your hands and the back of your neck as Ronan turned to look\nback at the bed he eyed then laid in the center of on his right side facing the\nside you had slept on the night before. In his own struggle to remain conscious\nin hopes of making good on your promised affection from earlier his body\nsettled fully clothed under the covers facing away from the door. All at once\ndarkness dropped on the city as the reinforcing shields on the tower rose\nthrough the shouts of the creatures outside bursting into panicked rages for\nshelter from the freezing rain and formerly hidden beasts now diving for them.</p><p>Your eyes shut trying to block out the noise in your mind for\na few moments until the near purring exhales from the shielded Kree brought a\nsmirk to your lips. On the bed you sat trying to grip the blanket only to find\nit tucked under the back of the warrior hoarding the blankets towards his\nfront. Under your breath you mumbled, \u201cOf course you\u2019re a blanket hog.\u201d You\nsighed continuing, \u201cWhat am I supposed to when you\u2019re purring like that, nudge\nyou and say please wake up?\u201d You sighed then flinched at the loud crash\nsounding from outside before you hopped over Ronan. You brushed down the blankets\nthere and laying in the space he had left there and eased them up over your\nshoulder when you laid on your side facing away from him.</p><p>Through the roaring storm and brutal battle outside your eyes\nclosed as you focused on the purring of the giant behind you. Purring that grew\ncloser the deeper you sank into your dreams as his body folded around yours in\na search for the warmth coming from you. Arms gripped you tightly as your legs\ntangled and his face buried in the back of your neck with your loose ponytail\ndraped around the top of his head.\u00a0</p><p>Firmly he held you until the noise outside\nceased at once urging the warrior\u2019s eyes open, a silent mental inspection of\nhis surroundings later his tensing body eased at your soft grumble. A\nstruggling shift later your hips were eased into a more comfortable yet awkward\nlooking position as your legs wove more between his signaling his arms to\ntighten holding you in place while his head pressed more against yours hoping\nto hold this for as long as he could. </p><p>Each moment more precious to him than the last, memorizing\nevery inch of your body pressed against his, even in this form he clung to your\nusing his body as a shield in your sleep while you burrowed deeper under his\nlarge frame making his smile grow through his eyes shutting again. Alone in\nthis silent tundra half to this strange planet fire rippled through his skin as\nhe could feel the contact sealing his bond with his Keeper. True this was\nnormally done in fewer layers but for now this would do, a brush of your hand\non his cheek or even a pressing of your lips to his cheek was what he assumed\nto have earned and yet he\u2019d been granted this marker. An embrace left to bonds\nfirmer than what he\u2019d assumed to have earned before a year had passed.</p><p>Through the door soft music played in discoordinate notes that\nyour host popped along to contently drawing a deeper breath from you making\nRonan grip you tighter in hopes of holding you in place just a few moments\nlonger. A few moments later however his body shifted to rise at yours shifting\nunder him. A pained grunt later he froze eyeing you with hand planted on the\nhard mattress asking, \u201cYour hand, right where it is could you press there on my\nback.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips timidly moving his hand from the rough sheet\nto your bare back under your brushed up shirt, \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Your head nodded, \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>Gradually he added pressure until he heard a clear pop\nfollowed by a pleased grumble from you. Slowly his hand shifted higher on your\nback, following the tension in your muscles that were firmly massaged in his\nrise to straddle your hips as he saw your body relaxing more at his touch, \u201cWas\nmy weight too much for you?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cNo.\u201d another pleased sigh left you at\nhis other hand moving higher on your back over its twin. \u201cYou aren\u2019t nearly as\nheavy as you imagine yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other stops?\u201d</p><p>A clang through the door made his hands pull back as he\nstraightened up moving his hands to his thighs to look at the door with\ncuriously furrowed brows. \u201cShould be clear to head back. Just have to say bye\nto the Brucey first though. Just lounging today I think.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and peered down at you when you wiggled onto your\nback under him brushing your hair from your face, \u201cBrucey?\u201d</p><p>As he eased back off you to the foot of the bed he watched\nyour rise to fix your hair and shirt to cover your bra before you both added\nyour shoes. With the bed made you added your flannel again and led the way out\nto the kitchen where the orb eyed you both and grumbled to you in that same\nlanguage from the night before, passing you both a thin tortilla each coated\nwith orange jam you thanked him for then floated back to his greenhouse. Warmly\nRonan\u2019s hand rested on your side and you popped back to your room in his ship\nwhere you shifted him back to his normal form then moved to hop on the bed. On\nyour knees you rested then twisted and plopped onto your back through his eyes\nlooking you over.</p><p>Through your door the noise grew as your eyes closed again\nmaking his brows furrow and sent him into the hall making the noise slowly die\ndown as news of your return spread. Quickly Ronan settled the matters requiring\nhim then returned to find you still asleep, with a determined sigh he turned to leave,\nstraight for the mess hall he went and returned with a floating tray behind him\ncoated in food and drinks. The shift of your mattress stirred your eyes open\nearning a smile from you while his hand moved to ease back the front of your\nflannel eyeing your shoulder ensuring your veins had all turned back from their\nformer purple state. \u201cI brought food. Have you gotten enough rest?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and sat up brushing your hair from your face, \u201cYes.\nWere there problems with me taking you for so long?\u201d</p><p>Ronan shook his head, \u201cNo, just a few squabbles. Nebula has\nbeen trying to gain trust again.\u201d</p><p>Your brow rose, \u201cGain it how, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ronan chuckled shifting your servings closer to you on the\ntray now resting on the legs he pulled out from under the tray to cover both\nyour laps as he faced you with his own legs crossed in front of him. \u201cSeries of\nduels and challenges, as per Kree tradition. Though she hasn\u2019t gained much\nfavor in our absence, it tends to work with the accuser in sight.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk and playfully furrowed brows you asked him, \u201cDid\nyou just refer to yourself in the third person?\u201d</p><p>His eyes rose and he replied, \u201cOh. No. In this instance you\nwould be the accuser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how are duels supposed to gain my trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are meant to prove she is willing and able to serve you\nno matter the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Filling his spoon again he locked his eyes with yours as a\nsmirk eased onto his face, \u201cHmm?\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://blankdblank.tumblr.com/post/183496802069/prisoner-pt-5\" target=\"_blank\">Pt 5</a></p>",

Taking the lead his arm nudged you to the right. \u201cYour\nhealing abilities could do wonders for my people. One of our main principles is\nto capture and cleanse any with traits unworthy of our people and those useful\nto us are claimed.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you asked, \u201cClaimed how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are extracted through blood or removal of limbs. Others\nrequire more primitive attempts for carrying on in our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning breeding?\u201d He nodded and you let out a weak giggle,\n\u201cSo I take it had I a great number for my race they would be captured by\nyours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d His eyes lingered on you watching your smirk\ngrow, \u201cThe thought amuses you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am wondering how many races have been stolen by yours\nto form the ones I have encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a race since the mortals a few thousand\nyears back. The Asguardians seemed to grow irritated with it. We abandoned our\nstudies when the hassle outweighed the progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him with a soft giggle then shook your head\nmaking him look you over, focusing on your curves mainly in an attempt to inspect\nyour breathing. Only to lose his train of thought until your hand on his arm\nbrought his focus back to the present just a few inches from a wall just a foot\nfrom the hall he had been leading you to. In a side step to your right he did\nthe same felling a sting at your hand leaving his arm. The open mess hall ahead\nmade your step pause when the sea of blue heads turned to you each sending\nrespectful bows of their head between Kreeish growls of your title as Ronan\u2019s\nKeeper. Through the room Ronan led you to the end of the line asking, \u201cWhat did\nyou wish to eat. You may have your fill of anything we can supply.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him after eyeing the odd long supply of\nfoods you could not identify, \u201cYou can pick for me.\u201d</p><p>He looked you over then faced forward listing a supply of food\nbefore reaching down and claiming your hand to lead you at his side to his\ntable, also claiming one of the silver cups set on the window opening\nseparating you from the food the others accepted their trays through. You\naccepted the other cup and raised it higher to give it a curious whiff while\nKorath and Gamora placed their orders and accepted their trays. A table in an\nalcove atop a couple steps came into view on your left. Extending his arm he\nguided you up first to claim one of the seats while he accepted the other at\nyour side through a pair of Kree approaching to set plates of tall piles of\nfood in front of you along with a set of spoons.</p><p>Looking you over in their step back he asked, \u201cYou do not\napprove of your drink?\u201d</p><p>Your head turned to look at him, \u201cIt smells like mangoes.\u201d\nRaising it to your lips you blinked through your sip as other Kree in the mess\nhall within sight eyed your reaction. In a stoic face you lowered the\nsurprisingly hot mixture tasting nothing like mangoes, more like green beans\nmixed with honey glazed ham strangely enough. \u201cHmm. Definitely not mangoes.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at him after he had taken a sip of his darker\ndrink choice reeking of melted butter on toast that darkened his teeth coating\nit in a thin black layer of liquid<b>,\n\u201cRoob.\u201d</b> He named his drink in Kreeish at your curious glance in his cup.\n\u201cFor our warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour teeth.\u201d After a pause you asked, \u201cDoes mine change my\nteeth?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, \u201cNo. <b>Gref</b>\ndoes not have those effects. We give it to our Children and Keepers to build\ntheir health on our ships.\u201d</p><p>You raised a brow, \u201cI am in need of building then?\u201d</p><p>He eased his eyes over your face taking in your playful glint\nin your eyes Gamora and Korath missed in their claiming the table behind you\nwith oddly yellow drinks you were too far from to smell you eyed curiously,\n\u201cYou do not want <b>Nrog</b>.\u201d You turned\nto look at him again, \u201cIt is poison to most races. We supply it for only them,\nto counter the toxins Thanos unleashed in their bodies. Grants them time to\nremain among us before having to return to him for the antidote.\u201d</p><p>Turning again you asked Gamora, \u201cDoes Nebula need that?\u201d</p><p>Gamora looked to her glass then shook her head, \u201cNo. She does\nnot need it. We can survive days without it.\u201d</p><p>A snap of your fingers later Nebula dropped heavily with legs\ncrossed jolting her awake to look you over then jump up with dagger drawn until\nyou stated, \u201cYou should eat.\u201d</p><p>Angrily she scowled at you, \u201cI do not require sustenance for\nweeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick. Eat something, drink your medicine.\u201d</p><p>At this she growled, \u201cI do not take orders from the likes of you!\u201d\n</p><p>Around her the Kree halted and Ronan lowered his glass only to\nremain still at your crossed leg moving to rest against his through his\ngrowling out in Kreeish, \u201c<b>Kneel or fall</b>.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned to you, \u201cI am not in need of sustenance, and I\nwill not respect any who show weakness at the suffering of others!\u201d</p><p>With a smile you lowered your glass from a sip of the odd\nliquid, \u201cYour respect has little value for me.\u201d Those words made her lips part\nand the Kree grow silent as they took in what you had missed as the worst sort\nof insult to their kind marking her even below the worth of a servant, marking\nher as a waste of being in their translation. \u201cLife really sucks. I know what\nyou have suffered, and suffer from still. Eat, drink, feel better. When you\nshow me something useful in your book of tricks past being Thanos\u2019 play thing\nthen we can bring up respect again.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply she blinked then seemingly had to jerk her\nbody into moving to turn and claim her place in line through the Kree stealing\nsmirking glances at you as Ronan nipped at his lower lip to contain his pleased\ngrin and raised his spoon from the table. In his first scoop your eyes turned\nto his food as you claimed your own spoon to fill. Curiously you tasted the\nbland yet scalding hot rice like food, eating it stoically until the next\nspoonful that was a jolt of spices and somehow freezing cold. Each bite grew\nmore intriguing until you cleared your plate and finished your drink somehow\nspreading Ronan\u2019s grin at your taking to the food so well and being able to\nfinish the large supply so easily.</p><p>Again you were on your feet when two Kree arrived to clear\nyour table. Through the mess hall you felt all eyes on you with pleased smirks\non the faces of the dispersing Warriors all returning to their own quarters and\nposts to either dress or report for duties. Glancing up at him you asked, \u201cWhat\ndo you have planned for today?\u201d</p><p>Curiously he blinked at you trying to pinpoint just what\nemotions you were feeling. The jumble of pleasure and intrigue washed through\nhim at once, \u201cWhat did you wish for me to do?\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to disturb your duties. I\nimagine you\u2019ve a great deal to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Playfully you replied, \u201cNo it can\u2019t.\u201d When you reached your\ndoor you tapped the knot by the door on the wall opening the door you passed\nthrough walking backwards, \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man. Don\u2019t mind me, plenty to keep me\noccupied.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he stepped inside with the door closing behind him\nto follow you into the bathroom where he watched you set your makeup bag on the\ncounter by the sink where you had set up a tall mirror. A small dab of eye\nprimer was added to your pinky finger and smoothed on your upper eye lid before\nanother was applied to the other. \u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make a stop in a Korna.\u201d Making his lips part,\n\u201cUnless you disapprove.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lowered to watch you draw out your eye liner and add\na sleek line around your upper lid, \u201cI am going with you if you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you have the time? I don\u2019t want to take you\nfrom your crew if they need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you alone ever. Especially on Korna.\u201d He\nshifted to peek in your bag eyeing the eye shadow you chose from after\noutlining your other eye. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Korna, I\u2019ve been there dozens of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire planet is filled with scavengers and vagabonds.\nNowhere near worthy of your visit. What business do you have there?\u201d</p><p>In a glance at him you let out a weak giggle saying, \u201cI\nsuppose you would only feel comfortable leaving me with your crew then. After\nall, they are just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were true I would not be their commander.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk you opened the square of pale silver to peach eye\nshadows with brush in hand, \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant, and you should leave.\u201d His\nbrow rose but he did not move, watching you smooth three shades above your eye,\n\u201cUnless you want to go dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>Flatly he replied, \u201cI will require my armor. We do not have\nallies on Korna.\u201d</p><p>With a final swipe of your brush you put them away saying,\n\u201cMarshmallow it is then.\u201d</p><p>In your path to your bedroom again he watched as you pulled\noff your shorts, eyeing the curves the hems of your panties hugged and\naccentuated so perfectly almost drawing a growl from him in his struggle not to\ncross the room to you. Your bend over to dig out a pair of jeans and socks only\nworsening things. In place he stood as you pulled on your socks then bounced\ninto your jeans you added your belt to the loops at the waistband. When you\nglanced up at him you bent to grab your converse and your flannel shirt.</p><p>You crossed the room to him spotting his hungry eyes looking\nyou over then all but smirking openly when your hand planted on his upper arm\nguiding him to turn towards the door. In a low growl he repeated,\n\u201cMarshmallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour alias, remember? First, you need shoes at least.\u201d Your hand\ndropped and he hit the knot on the wall by your door leading you out into the\nhall as you pulled on your flannel.\u00a0</p><p>In his room you stood by the door pulling\non your converse and tied them and stood watching as he grabbed his under shirt\nand chest plate. The slow rippling of his back in his easing the sleeves of his\nshirt over his arms and head through the neck hole almost making him freeze at\nthe rush of an almost starving lust coming from you in your inspection of him.\nThe layer dropped over his back and he turned hearing your steps closer to him.\nThrough a broken inhale his eyes watched as you claimed his chest plate and\nhelped him settle it over his torso before he tightened the sides.</p><p>In a searching gaze over your face you grabbed his socks he\u2019d\nset aside and held them between you signaling his hand to rise and claim them\nin his wonder at your now muddled blur of emotions poorly hiding under the\nremaining cloud of lust, making sure to glide his fingers against yours in\nclaiming the pair he pulled on before bending to add his boots.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"leepace71:e55eYxwOC3VjbUjm7RulPg:ZicWDo2dkg44M\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5de02c2b672e5acb5d3b9675a0e323/tumblr_pi69opql6B1tugymxo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>Upright again\nhe watched your amused glint in your eyes as his appearance shifted back to the\njean and smurf t shirt wearing doppelganger with scruff and shaggy hair, \u201cFor\nthe record, I despise this disguise.\u201d</p><p>Your smile and soft giggle came with your saying, \u201cStop being\nso cute. You know you enjoy hiding.\u201d Before he could say anything you were both\ntransported in the center of a bustling city packed with grime coated\ndilapidated towers around you on a packed street full of passing sneers and\ndiscerning glares at you and Ronan. Firmly his hand claimed yours in your\nguiding him through the street as a voice shouted out in Nian, <b>\u201cHow about you\nmake me?!\u201d </b></p><p>His grip tightened with each block you passed as creature\nafter creature eyed you both in disappointment at the lack of any valuables to\nsteal. In a lean down he growled close to your ear almost dropping himself to\nhis knees at the allured response it drew in you, \u201cNext time-.\u201d</p><p>At once his voice broke off and his eyes dropped hungrily to\nyour lips just inches from his, \u201cFew more minutes then we can get back to your\nship. Next time will be simpler.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he eyed your figure in your turn to guide him around\nthe corner and down the next alley where he let out another growl in your\nentering the first beaded string coated doorway on your left. Under furrowed\nbrows he eyed the seedy shop around you with row after row of wooden slat\nformed benches packed with obscure items and weapons. A single glance at you a\nDark Elf left the shop at the sight of you mumbling, \u201cI am out of here.\u201d\nGrabbing his small honking winged lizard from the ground beside him he mumbled\nto, \u201cWe have a schedule to keep.\u201d</p><p>On his path out however he paused smirking at the small twig\nlike object you drew from your pocket and offered to the lizard that gleefully\nate it while his owner thanked you for the lizard\u2019s favorite treat on his\nbirthday, to which you answered, \u201cOf course I remembered his favorite!\u201d</p><p>Quietly the Elf left and you looked back to the displays as\nRonan lowly asked, \u201cFriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him, \u201cThe Cropiscaner yes. Never met the Elf\nbefore. They demand the treat each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly do you befriend a Cropiscaner? They are notorious\nfor attacking villages. Full herds have been known to send full planets into collapse.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cPicked him up on Troufless before it exploded.\nThor really didn\u2019t trust him, but if you had to choose between an exploding\nplanet or a ship with creatures that could kill you even the worst of the worst\ncould agree to get along.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cTrue.\u201d In another scanning look over you he asked,\n\u201cHow close to the worst of the worst would you consider Kree to be?\u201d</p><p>With a giggle you peered up at him catching his darkening eyes\nlowering to your lips again, \u201cI would never consider the Kree to be the worst,\nat anything.\u201d</p><p>Your answer drawing a smirk across his lips in your turn and\nstep away to continue your browsing in a determined step and lean forward he\ngrowled lowly beside your ear. \u201cFlirtation does not excuse my desire,\u201d his eyes\ntraveled over your neck at the row of bumps rising over your skin through the\nnext wave of your emotions coursed through his body and burned in his veins,\n\u201cFor an answer.\u201d</p><p>Just as soon as he\u2019d finished his sentence you turned easing\nyour lips just barely a breath from his urging a clear low growling exhale from\nhim in his attempt to announce his sheer invitation for any contact from you. \u201cJust\nwhat are you accusing me of?\u201d His eyes lowered to your lips in your step back\nto give his hand a tug after your finger tapping just under his chin in what\nyou missed as an all but promised contact later making him smirk again after a nip at his lip.</p><p>Three benches later he peered over your shoulder stealing a\nteasing brush of his free hand\u2019s fingers along the strip of skin\non your hip under your shirts when you reached for an crudely carved statue barely a few inches\nlong. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>You giggled softly saying, \u201cFrom Morag. Part of my nursery.\u201d\nHe nodded and followed you to the counter where the tentacle faced man eyed the\nstatue then you both then smirked at the bag of peppermints you drew from your\nenchanted pouch in your pocket and passed it to him as he handed you the statue\nin a small velvet pouch he slid it into. </p><p>With traded smirks you pocketed your goods and you led the\nshielded warrior through the alley again as he asked, \u201cWas that all you\nneeded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another planet nearby if you don\u2019t mind another\nstop.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNot at all. Wherever you need to go I will\nescort you.\u201d</p><p>Locking your eyes with his purple glowing pair you asked, \u201cHow\nbusy are your days if you can just spend all day following me around.\u201d Unable\nto help it his smirk deepened as you added, \u201cI just picture you lounging about\nbetween chosen destinations now with your men listening to your tales of Kree Warriors of old.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>A pop later the world changed to a desert coated planet you\nlanded on the outskirt of a small town in the center of nowhere with small\nfabric tents across from a stone formed city in the distance. Under foot the\nsand shifted awkwardly as Ronan walked beside you through the nothingness.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that arrow shaped column ahead?\u201d He nodded, \u201cJust past\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are we searching for?\u201d Adjusting his hand to fit\nmore around yours after your unsteady foot sliding off a tipping rock making\nyou bump into his side. \u201cAnother statue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat use could that statue be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone, not much to the unknowing eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d</p><p>You let out a weak giggle, \u201cMy Father left me gifts to find,\nshould I need them. But with Thanos running about it\u2019s best I gather them first\nbefore he tries to steal any of them again.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cThanos tried to steal one of your statues?\u201d</p><p>You shook you head, \u201cNo, my tesseract.\u201d Ronan\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>\u201cThe tesseract is yours?\u201d</p><p>You nodded then glanced up at him, \u201cTechnically the case is\nAsguardian but what it is holding, powering the cube is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Loki stole the tesseract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came to an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour marriage.\u201d</p><p>You let out a stunned giggle drawing his eyes from the blowing\nsand obstructing the path ahead to you, \u201cNo. A ride home to safety in exchange\nfor tabs on Thanos.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cYou were Loki\u2019s puppet master then.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cWe prefer ally. Heard him in passing\nwhen Frigga sent out word he fell from the Bifrost. She guaranteed the safety\nof my tesseract, I wasn\u2019t about to let her Son vanish into the vacuum of space.\nThanos found him, but not until after he heard my whisper in his ear of his\nMother\u2019s promise.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cHow did marriage come about then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been declared dead a couple times. Needed a place to\nhide. Nowhere near as obstinate as his Brother would lead others to assume.\u201d In\nanother glance up at Ronan you smirked, \u201cJust like you. So very agreeable for a\nconqueror of worlds. A welcome change, usually I tend to get trapped with\nothers like Nebula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for you to be harmed.\u201d</p><p>You smirked again, \u201cOnly a simple hostage trade right?\u201d</p><p>Another squeeze came around your hand, \u201cYou are not my\nhostage.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle you replied, \u201cOh yes. You only have no intention of letting\nme out of your sight ever again, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is only fitting. Healing my Mother has aided my people in\nways you cannot grasp just yet. I would be foolish to repay that by leaving you\nunprotected.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you smirked, \u201cWho says I\u2019m not the one\nprotecting you for something, hmm?\u201d As you looked forward his lips parted and\nthe thought raced through his mind running through the validity of your\nsuggestion, leaving him to wonder just what it could be and how you letting him\ntake you could fit into a plan to protect him.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly an hour later your sneaker hit a thick rock in your hop\nup out of the sand into the rocky climb ahead leading to the arrow shaped rock.\nTenderly his fingers brushed along your palm releasing your hands to aid in\nyour climbing, he hopped up behind you and wet his lips as he pulled himself up\nover another large boulder after you. Around a winding jagged path you trekked\nand walked until he watched you kneel at the base of the rock feature. At the\nbase you shifted a sand covered chunk of amber and dug out a trio of velvet\nwrapped statues you pocketed with the other in your enchanted pouch after Ronan\ngave the trio a curious once over. \u201cThey look like game pieces.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk at him you said, \u201cIn a way they are.\u201d The amber\nwas buried again and you climbed down after your glance up at the yellow sky as\nthe green sun rose to claim the sinking blue sun\u2019s position summoning a wall of\ndust on the horizon. Looking towards the stone city you stated, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to\nstay the night.\u201d He eyed the same wall of dust in the start of your climb as\nyou stated, \u201cThe green sun only makes the air thinner, I zap us out of here\nit\u2019ll ignite.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI take it you have allies here as well for\nshelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. But I do have some parsnip seeds.\u201d He looked at you\nwhen you jumped down to the sand you sunk in to your ankles. He jumped down\nbeside you and shook each foot free just as you did in your path to the city in\nthe distance.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you travel? Barter your way through the\nuniverse?\u201d</p><p>You giggled again, \u201cWell not all of us have a fleet of blue\nwarriors willing to tear through planets at our beck and call as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d</p><p>With another giggle you replied, \u201cDo not promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cYou should probably read through my\nlist of enemies before you go promising me that. I doubt you would after giving\nit a read. More than a few of your allies I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Ronan\u2019s chin tilted and his eyes fell to your hand again,\n\u201cKree do not collect allies.\u201d </p><p>His eyes looked you over as you said, \u201cWell consider yourself\nthe exception.\u201d</p><p>He smirked as he stated, \u201cI did not collect you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cNope you just kidnap yours.\u201d Giggling again as\nyour eyes met then broke apart as you faced the city again.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly halfway the temperature dropped as you passed through\nwhat felt to be a icy barrier marking the shift from sand to brittle broken\ngrey earth surrounded by jagged half buried stones. Across a frozen lake you\ncrossed with your hand locked in Ronan\u2019s holding him steady on the climb up\nonto the broken bridge to enter the city just as a blast of frigid icy air blew\nstraight at you. In a shift closer to you Ronan asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people train to withstand great climate shifts.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle as the wind picked up you replied, \u201cSo that\u2019s a\nyes, you\u2019re just too stubborn to admit it.\u201d Making him smirk at your back as\nyou led the way through the city.</p><p>Winding streets later past the surprisingly hundreds of\nscantily clad species between the bundled rarities of visitors eyed you both\ncuriously as the only humanoids in sight until Ronan paused watching your fist\nraise and crash loudly into the metal door at the base of a jagged tower wall\nwith a growing sheet of ice forming on it. Roughly a voice in a tongue he did\nnot recognize called out, <b>\u201cGo away!\u201d</b></p><p>Harshly you shouted back over the growing wind, <b>\u201cNaq, you will\nopen this door!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo vacancy!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come over there myself! I will break your door\ndown!\u201d</b></p><p>A shuffling was heard through the metal, <b>\u201cNo room!\u201d</b></p><p>You nodded, <b>\u201cMore Parsnip seeds for myself then!\u201d</b></p><p>At that a hidden slot on the door opened revealing twelve eyes\non the end of shifting stalks appeared peering at you both as the voice called\nback, <b>\u201cThere is only one bed.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cOpen the door.\u201d</b></p><p>The slot was shut and the door was cracked signaling the\ncrowds around you to halt and dart towards the door, only to fall at the cracks\nin the walls from above opened revealing a set of rotating barrels on a gun\nshooting out spikes at each that dared enter but you and Ronan. The floating\norb of eyes coiled up behind the door you and Ronan slammed then bolted shut\nagain behind you. The warmly lit room grew when you turned to face the\nexpanding orb that turned from a sickly grey to its dark green shade in the\nwarmth again.</p><p>You dug in your pocket for the seeds half of the eyes scanned\nover until you passed the small vial into the tentacle extended for it after it\nstopped in front of the doorway to the room you were offered. Curiously Ronan\nlooked it over as the gleefully popping orb floated to his greenhouse down the\nhall to plant three of the seeds and save the rest for later. As you sat at the\nfoot of the bed Ronan lit the fire in the room before moving to close the door\nleaving you alone again finally then turned to sit beside you to remove his\nboots. </p><p>Before he could say anything he turned his head seeing the\npurple veins showing through your skin under the flannel shirt you set aside\nthen stood. In a deep growl he stated, \u201cYou\u2019re injured!\u201d</p><p>You glanced back at him, \u201cNo. It\u2019s, hard to explain. It\u2019s an\neffect from the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re harming you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m shielding their power until we return to your ship.\u201d\nYou moved to the water basin in the wall fed from a small fountain feeding\nthrough to the wall into the greenhouse next door. Gingerly you smoothed the\nwarm water over your hands and the back of your neck as Ronan turned to look\nback at the bed he eyed then laid in the center of on his right side facing the\nside you had slept on the night before. In his own struggle to remain conscious\nin hopes of making good on your promised affection from earlier his body\nsettled fully clothed under the covers facing away from the door. All at once\ndarkness dropped on the city as the reinforcing shields on the tower rose\nthrough the shouts of the creatures outside bursting into panicked rages for\nshelter from the freezing rain and formerly hidden beasts now diving for them.</p><p>Your eyes shut trying to block out the noise in your mind for\na few moments until the near purring exhales from the shielded Kree brought a\nsmirk to your lips. On the bed you sat trying to grip the blanket only to find\nit tucked under the back of the warrior hoarding the blankets towards his\nfront. Under your breath you mumbled, \u201cOf course you\u2019re a blanket hog.\u201d You\nsighed continuing, \u201cWhat am I supposed to when you\u2019re purring like that, nudge\nyou and say please wake up?\u201d You sighed then flinched at the loud crash\nsounding from outside before you hopped over Ronan. You brushed down the blankets\nthere and laying in the space he had left there and eased them up over your\nshoulder when you laid on your side facing away from him.</p><p>Through the roaring storm and brutal battle outside your eyes\nclosed as you focused on the purring of the giant behind you. Purring that grew\ncloser the deeper you sank into your dreams as his body folded around yours in\na search for the warmth coming from you. Arms gripped you tightly as your legs\ntangled and his face buried in the back of your neck with your loose ponytail\ndraped around the top of his head.\u00a0</p><p>Firmly he held you until the noise outside\nceased at once urging the warrior\u2019s eyes open, a silent mental inspection of\nhis surroundings later his tensing body eased at your soft grumble. A\nstruggling shift later your hips were eased into a more comfortable yet awkward\nlooking position as your legs wove more between his signaling his arms to\ntighten holding you in place while his head pressed more against yours hoping\nto hold this for as long as he could. </p><p>Each moment more precious to him than the last, memorizing\nevery inch of your body pressed against his, even in this form he clung to your\nusing his body as a shield in your sleep while you burrowed deeper under his\nlarge frame making his smile grow through his eyes shutting again. Alone in\nthis silent tundra half to this strange planet fire rippled through his skin as\nhe could feel the contact sealing his bond with his Keeper. True this was\nnormally done in fewer layers but for now this would do, a brush of your hand\non his cheek or even a pressing of your lips to his cheek was what he assumed\nto have earned and yet he\u2019d been granted this marker. An embrace left to bonds\nfirmer than what he\u2019d assumed to have earned before a year had passed.</p><p>Through the door soft music played in discoordinate notes that\nyour host popped along to contently drawing a deeper breath from you making\nRonan grip you tighter in hopes of holding you in place just a few moments\nlonger. A few moments later however his body shifted to rise at yours shifting\nunder him. A pained grunt later he froze eyeing you with hand planted on the\nhard mattress asking, \u201cYour hand, right where it is could you press there on my\nback.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips timidly moving his hand from the rough sheet\nto your bare back under your brushed up shirt, \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Your head nodded, \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>Gradually he added pressure until he heard a clear pop\nfollowed by a pleased grumble from you. Slowly his hand shifted higher on your\nback, following the tension in your muscles that were firmly massaged in his\nrise to straddle your hips as he saw your body relaxing more at his touch, \u201cWas\nmy weight too much for you?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cNo.\u201d another pleased sigh left you at\nhis other hand moving higher on your back over its twin. \u201cYou aren\u2019t nearly as\nheavy as you imagine yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other stops?\u201d</p><p>A clang through the door made his hands pull back as he\nstraightened up moving his hands to his thighs to look at the door with\ncuriously furrowed brows. \u201cShould be clear to head back. Just have to say bye\nto the Brucey first though. Just lounging today I think.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and peered down at you when you wiggled onto your\nback under him brushing your hair from your face, \u201cBrucey?\u201d</p><p>As he eased back off you to the foot of the bed he watched\nyour rise to fix your hair and shirt to cover your bra before you both added\nyour shoes. With the bed made you added your flannel again and led the way out\nto the kitchen where the orb eyed you both and grumbled to you in that same\nlanguage from the night before, passing you both a thin tortilla each coated\nwith orange jam you thanked him for then floated back to his greenhouse. Warmly\nRonan\u2019s hand rested on your side and you popped back to your room in his ship\nwhere you shifted him back to his normal form then moved to hop on the bed. On\nyour knees you rested then twisted and plopped onto your back through his eyes\nlooking you over.</p><p>Through your door the noise grew as your eyes closed again\nmaking his brows furrow and sent him into the hall making the noise slowly die\ndown as news of your return spread. Quickly Ronan settled the matters requiring\nhim then returned to find you still asleep, with a determined sigh he turned to leave,\nstraight for the mess hall he went and returned with a floating tray behind him\ncoated in food and drinks. The shift of your mattress stirred your eyes open\nearning a smile from you while his hand moved to ease back the front of your\nflannel eyeing your shoulder ensuring your veins had all turned back from their\nformer purple state. \u201cI brought food. Have you gotten enough rest?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and sat up brushing your hair from your face, \u201cYes.\nWere there problems with me taking you for so long?\u201d</p><p>Ronan shook his head, \u201cNo, just a few squabbles. Nebula has\nbeen trying to gain trust again.\u201d</p><p>Your brow rose, \u201cGain it how, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ronan chuckled shifting your servings closer to you on the\ntray now resting on the legs he pulled out from under the tray to cover both\nyour laps as he faced you with his own legs crossed in front of him. \u201cSeries of\nduels and challenges, as per Kree tradition. Though she hasn\u2019t gained much\nfavor in our absence, it tends to work with the accuser in sight.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk and playfully furrowed brows you asked him, \u201cDid\nyou just refer to yourself in the third person?\u201d</p><p>His eyes rose and he replied, \u201cOh. No. In this instance you\nwould be the accuser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how are duels supposed to gain my trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are meant to prove she is willing and able to serve you\nno matter the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Filling his spoon again he locked his eyes with yours as a\nsmirk eased onto his face, \u201cHmm?\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://blankdblank.tumblr.com/post/183496802069/prisoner-pt-5\" target=\"_blank\">Pt 5</a></p></p>",

Taking the lead his arm nudged you to the right. \u201cYour\nhealing abilities could do wonders for my people. One of our main principles is\nto capture and cleanse any with traits unworthy of our people and those useful\nto us are claimed.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you asked, \u201cClaimed how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are extracted through blood or removal of limbs. Others\nrequire more primitive attempts for carrying on in our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning breeding?\u201d He nodded and you let out a weak giggle,\n\u201cSo I take it had I a great number for my race they would be captured by\nyours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d His eyes lingered on you watching your smirk\ngrow, \u201cThe thought amuses you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am wondering how many races have been stolen by yours\nto form the ones I have encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a race since the mortals a few thousand\nyears back. The Asguardians seemed to grow irritated with it. We abandoned our\nstudies when the hassle outweighed the progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him with a soft giggle then shook your head\nmaking him look you over, focusing on your curves mainly in an attempt to inspect\nyour breathing. Only to lose his train of thought until your hand on his arm\nbrought his focus back to the present just a few inches from a wall just a foot\nfrom the hall he had been leading you to. In a side step to your right he did\nthe same felling a sting at your hand leaving his arm. The open mess hall ahead\nmade your step pause when the sea of blue heads turned to you each sending\nrespectful bows of their head between Kreeish growls of your title as Ronan\u2019s\nKeeper. Through the room Ronan led you to the end of the line asking, \u201cWhat did\nyou wish to eat. You may have your fill of anything we can supply.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him after eyeing the odd long supply of\nfoods you could not identify, \u201cYou can pick for me.\u201d</p><p>He looked you over then faced forward listing a supply of food\nbefore reaching down and claiming your hand to lead you at his side to his\ntable, also claiming one of the silver cups set on the window opening\nseparating you from the food the others accepted their trays through. You\naccepted the other cup and raised it higher to give it a curious whiff while\nKorath and Gamora placed their orders and accepted their trays. A table in an\nalcove atop a couple steps came into view on your left. Extending his arm he\nguided you up first to claim one of the seats while he accepted the other at\nyour side through a pair of Kree approaching to set plates of tall piles of\nfood in front of you along with a set of spoons.</p><p>Looking you over in their step back he asked, \u201cYou do not\napprove of your drink?\u201d</p><p>Your head turned to look at him, \u201cIt smells like mangoes.\u201d\nRaising it to your lips you blinked through your sip as other Kree in the mess\nhall within sight eyed your reaction. In a stoic face you lowered the\nsurprisingly hot mixture tasting nothing like mangoes, more like green beans\nmixed with honey glazed ham strangely enough. \u201cHmm. Definitely not mangoes.\u201d</p><p>You glanced at him after he had taken a sip of his darker\ndrink choice reeking of melted butter on toast that darkened his teeth coating\nit in a thin black layer of liquid<b>,\n\u201cRoob.\u201d</b> He named his drink in Kreeish at your curious glance in his cup.\n\u201cFor our warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour teeth.\u201d After a pause you asked, \u201cDoes mine change my\nteeth?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, \u201cNo. <b>Gref</b>\ndoes not have those effects. We give it to our Children and Keepers to build\ntheir health on our ships.\u201d</p><p>You raised a brow, \u201cI am in need of building then?\u201d</p><p>He eased his eyes over your face taking in your playful glint\nin your eyes Gamora and Korath missed in their claiming the table behind you\nwith oddly yellow drinks you were too far from to smell you eyed curiously,\n\u201cYou do not want <b>Nrog</b>.\u201d You turned\nto look at him again, \u201cIt is poison to most races. We supply it for only them,\nto counter the toxins Thanos unleashed in their bodies. Grants them time to\nremain among us before having to return to him for the antidote.\u201d</p><p>Turning again you asked Gamora, \u201cDoes Nebula need that?\u201d</p><p>Gamora looked to her glass then shook her head, \u201cNo. She does\nnot need it. We can survive days without it.\u201d</p><p>A snap of your fingers later Nebula dropped heavily with legs\ncrossed jolting her awake to look you over then jump up with dagger drawn until\nyou stated, \u201cYou should eat.\u201d</p><p>Angrily she scowled at you, \u201cI do not require sustenance for\nweeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick. Eat something, drink your medicine.\u201d</p><p>At this she growled, \u201cI do not take orders from the likes of you!\u201d\n</p><p>Around her the Kree halted and Ronan lowered his glass only to\nremain still at your crossed leg moving to rest against his through his\ngrowling out in Kreeish, \u201c<b>Kneel or fall</b>.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned to you, \u201cI am not in need of sustenance, and I\nwill not respect any who show weakness at the suffering of others!\u201d</p><p>With a smile you lowered your glass from a sip of the odd\nliquid, \u201cYour respect has little value for me.\u201d Those words made her lips part\nand the Kree grow silent as they took in what you had missed as the worst sort\nof insult to their kind marking her even below the worth of a servant, marking\nher as a waste of being in their translation. \u201cLife really sucks. I know what\nyou have suffered, and suffer from still. Eat, drink, feel better. When you\nshow me something useful in your book of tricks past being Thanos\u2019 play thing\nthen we can bring up respect again.\u201d</p><p>Inhaling sharply she blinked then seemingly had to jerk her\nbody into moving to turn and claim her place in line through the Kree stealing\nsmirking glances at you as Ronan nipped at his lower lip to contain his pleased\ngrin and raised his spoon from the table. In his first scoop your eyes turned\nto his food as you claimed your own spoon to fill. Curiously you tasted the\nbland yet scalding hot rice like food, eating it stoically until the next\nspoonful that was a jolt of spices and somehow freezing cold. Each bite grew\nmore intriguing until you cleared your plate and finished your drink somehow\nspreading Ronan\u2019s grin at your taking to the food so well and being able to\nfinish the large supply so easily.</p><p>Again you were on your feet when two Kree arrived to clear\nyour table. Through the mess hall you felt all eyes on you with pleased smirks\non the faces of the dispersing Warriors all returning to their own quarters and\nposts to either dress or report for duties. Glancing up at him you asked, \u201cWhat\ndo you have planned for today?\u201d</p><p>Curiously he blinked at you trying to pinpoint just what\nemotions you were feeling. The jumble of pleasure and intrigue washed through\nhim at once, \u201cWhat did you wish for me to do?\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to disturb your duties. I\nimagine you\u2019ve a great deal to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>Playfully you replied, \u201cNo it can\u2019t.\u201d When you reached your\ndoor you tapped the knot by the door on the wall opening the door you passed\nthrough walking backwards, \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man. Don\u2019t mind me, plenty to keep me\noccupied.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he stepped inside with the door closing behind him\nto follow you into the bathroom where he watched you set your makeup bag on the\ncounter by the sink where you had set up a tall mirror. A small dab of eye\nprimer was added to your pinky finger and smoothed on your upper eye lid before\nanother was applied to the other. \u201cWhat will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to make a stop in a Korna.\u201d Making his lips part,\n\u201cUnless you disapprove.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lowered to watch you draw out your eye liner and add\na sleek line around your upper lid, \u201cI am going with you if you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you have the time? I don\u2019t want to take you\nfrom your crew if they need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not leaving you alone ever. Especially on Korna.\u201d He\nshifted to peek in your bag eyeing the eye shadow you chose from after\noutlining your other eye. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Korna, I\u2019ve been there dozens of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire planet is filled with scavengers and vagabonds.\nNowhere near worthy of your visit. What business do you have there?\u201d</p><p>In a glance at him you let out a weak giggle saying, \u201cI\nsuppose you would only feel comfortable leaving me with your crew then. After\nall, they are just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were true I would not be their commander.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk you opened the square of pale silver to peach eye\nshadows with brush in hand, \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant, and you should leave.\u201d His\nbrow rose but he did not move, watching you smooth three shades above your eye,\n\u201cUnless you want to go dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>Flatly he replied, \u201cI will require my armor. We do not have\nallies on Korna.\u201d</p><p>With a final swipe of your brush you put them away saying,\n\u201cMarshmallow it is then.\u201d</p><p>In your path to your bedroom again he watched as you pulled\noff your shorts, eyeing the curves the hems of your panties hugged and\naccentuated so perfectly almost drawing a growl from him in his struggle not to\ncross the room to you. Your bend over to dig out a pair of jeans and socks only\nworsening things. In place he stood as you pulled on your socks then bounced\ninto your jeans you added your belt to the loops at the waistband. When you\nglanced up at him you bent to grab your converse and your flannel shirt.</p><p>You crossed the room to him spotting his hungry eyes looking\nyou over then all but smirking openly when your hand planted on his upper arm\nguiding him to turn towards the door. In a low growl he repeated,\n\u201cMarshmallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour alias, remember? First, you need shoes at least.\u201d Your hand\ndropped and he hit the knot on the wall by your door leading you out into the\nhall as you pulled on your flannel.\u00a0</p><p>In his room you stood by the door pulling\non your converse and tied them and stood watching as he grabbed his under shirt\nand chest plate. The slow rippling of his back in his easing the sleeves of his\nshirt over his arms and head through the neck hole almost making him freeze at\nthe rush of an almost starving lust coming from you in your inspection of him.\nThe layer dropped over his back and he turned hearing your steps closer to him.\nThrough a broken inhale his eyes watched as you claimed his chest plate and\nhelped him settle it over his torso before he tightened the sides.</p><p>In a searching gaze over your face you grabbed his socks he\u2019d\nset aside and held them between you signaling his hand to rise and claim them\nin his wonder at your now muddled blur of emotions poorly hiding under the\nremaining cloud of lust, making sure to glide his fingers against yours in\nclaiming the pair he pulled on before bending to add his boots.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"leepace71:e55eYxwOC3VjbUjm7RulPg:ZicWDo2dkg44M\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab5de02c2b672e5acb5d3b9675a0e323/tumblr_pi69opql6B1tugymxo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p>Upright again\nhe watched your amused glint in your eyes as his appearance shifted back to the\njean and smurf t shirt wearing doppelganger with scruff and shaggy hair, \u201cFor\nthe record, I despise this disguise.\u201d</p><p>Your smile and soft giggle came with your saying, \u201cStop being\nso cute. You know you enjoy hiding.\u201d Before he could say anything you were both\ntransported in the center of a bustling city packed with grime coated\ndilapidated towers around you on a packed street full of passing sneers and\ndiscerning glares at you and Ronan. Firmly his hand claimed yours in your\nguiding him through the street as a voice shouted out in Nian, <b>\u201cHow about you\nmake me?!\u201d </b></p><p>His grip tightened with each block you passed as creature\nafter creature eyed you both in disappointment at the lack of any valuables to\nsteal. In a lean down he growled close to your ear almost dropping himself to\nhis knees at the allured response it drew in you, \u201cNext time-.\u201d</p><p>At once his voice broke off and his eyes dropped hungrily to\nyour lips just inches from his, \u201cFew more minutes then we can get back to your\nship. Next time will be simpler.\u201d</p><p>Curiously he eyed your figure in your turn to guide him around\nthe corner and down the next alley where he let out another growl in your\nentering the first beaded string coated doorway on your left. Under furrowed\nbrows he eyed the seedy shop around you with row after row of wooden slat\nformed benches packed with obscure items and weapons. A single glance at you a\nDark Elf left the shop at the sight of you mumbling, \u201cI am out of here.\u201d\nGrabbing his small honking winged lizard from the ground beside him he mumbled\nto, \u201cWe have a schedule to keep.\u201d</p><p>On his path out however he paused smirking at the small twig\nlike object you drew from your pocket and offered to the lizard that gleefully\nate it while his owner thanked you for the lizard\u2019s favorite treat on his\nbirthday, to which you answered, \u201cOf course I remembered his favorite!\u201d</p><p>Quietly the Elf left and you looked back to the displays as\nRonan lowly asked, \u201cFriend of yours?\u201d</p><p>You glanced up at him, \u201cThe Cropiscaner yes. Never met the Elf\nbefore. They demand the treat each year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exactly do you befriend a Cropiscaner? They are notorious\nfor attacking villages. Full herds have been known to send full planets into collapse.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cPicked him up on Troufless before it exploded.\nThor really didn\u2019t trust him, but if you had to choose between an exploding\nplanet or a ship with creatures that could kill you even the worst of the worst\ncould agree to get along.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cTrue.\u201d In another scanning look over you he asked,\n\u201cHow close to the worst of the worst would you consider Kree to be?\u201d</p><p>With a giggle you peered up at him catching his darkening eyes\nlowering to your lips again, \u201cI would never consider the Kree to be the worst,\nat anything.\u201d</p><p>Your answer drawing a smirk across his lips in your turn and\nstep away to continue your browsing in a determined step and lean forward he\ngrowled lowly beside your ear. \u201cFlirtation does not excuse my desire,\u201d his eyes\ntraveled over your neck at the row of bumps rising over your skin through the\nnext wave of your emotions coursed through his body and burned in his veins,\n\u201cFor an answer.\u201d</p><p>Just as soon as he\u2019d finished his sentence you turned easing\nyour lips just barely a breath from his urging a clear low growling exhale from\nhim in his attempt to announce his sheer invitation for any contact from you. \u201cJust\nwhat are you accusing me of?\u201d His eyes lowered to your lips in your step back\nto give his hand a tug after your finger tapping just under his chin in what\nyou missed as an all but promised contact later making him smirk again after a nip at his lip.</p><p>Three benches later he peered over your shoulder stealing a\nteasing brush of his free hand\u2019s fingers along the strip of skin\non your hip under your shirts when you reached for an crudely carved statue barely a few inches\nlong. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>You giggled softly saying, \u201cFrom Morag. Part of my nursery.\u201d\nHe nodded and followed you to the counter where the tentacle faced man eyed the\nstatue then you both then smirked at the bag of peppermints you drew from your\nenchanted pouch in your pocket and passed it to him as he handed you the statue\nin a small velvet pouch he slid it into. </p><p>With traded smirks you pocketed your goods and you led the\nshielded warrior through the alley again as he asked, \u201cWas that all you\nneeded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another planet nearby if you don\u2019t mind another\nstop.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, \u201cNot at all. Wherever you need to go I will\nescort you.\u201d</p><p>Locking your eyes with his purple glowing pair you asked, \u201cHow\nbusy are your days if you can just spend all day following me around.\u201d Unable\nto help it his smirk deepened as you added, \u201cI just picture you lounging about\nbetween chosen destinations now with your men listening to your tales of Kree Warriors of old.\u201d</p><p>.</p><p>A pop later the world changed to a desert coated planet you\nlanded on the outskirt of a small town in the center of nowhere with small\nfabric tents across from a stone formed city in the distance. Under foot the\nsand shifted awkwardly as Ronan walked beside you through the nothingness.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that arrow shaped column ahead?\u201d He nodded, \u201cJust past\nthat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are we searching for?\u201d Adjusting his hand to fit\nmore around yours after your unsteady foot sliding off a tipping rock making\nyou bump into his side. \u201cAnother statue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat use could that statue be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone, not much to the unknowing eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d</p><p>You let out a weak giggle, \u201cMy Father left me gifts to find,\nshould I need them. But with Thanos running about it\u2019s best I gather them first\nbefore he tries to steal any of them again.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cThanos tried to steal one of your statues?\u201d</p><p>You shook you head, \u201cNo, my tesseract.\u201d Ronan\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>\u201cThe tesseract is yours?\u201d</p><p>You nodded then glanced up at him, \u201cTechnically the case is\nAsguardian but what it is holding, powering the cube is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Loki stole the tesseract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came to an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour marriage.\u201d</p><p>You let out a stunned giggle drawing his eyes from the blowing\nsand obstructing the path ahead to you, \u201cNo. A ride home to safety in exchange\nfor tabs on Thanos.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cYou were Loki\u2019s puppet master then.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cWe prefer ally. Heard him in passing\nwhen Frigga sent out word he fell from the Bifrost. She guaranteed the safety\nof my tesseract, I wasn\u2019t about to let her Son vanish into the vacuum of space.\nThanos found him, but not until after he heard my whisper in his ear of his\nMother\u2019s promise.\u201d</p><p>Ronan, \u201cHow did marriage come about then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been declared dead a couple times. Needed a place to\nhide. Nowhere near as obstinate as his Brother would lead others to assume.\u201d In\nanother glance up at Ronan you smirked, \u201cJust like you. So very agreeable for a\nconqueror of worlds. A welcome change, usually I tend to get trapped with\nothers like Nebula.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant for you to be harmed.\u201d</p><p>You smirked again, \u201cOnly a simple hostage trade right?\u201d</p><p>Another squeeze came around your hand, \u201cYou are not my\nhostage.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle you replied, \u201cOh yes. You only have no intention of letting\nme out of your sight ever again, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is only fitting. Healing my Mother has aided my people in\nways you cannot grasp just yet. I would be foolish to repay that by leaving you\nunprotected.\u201d</p><p>In a glance up at him you smirked, \u201cWho says I\u2019m not the one\nprotecting you for something, hmm?\u201d As you looked forward his lips parted and\nthe thought raced through his mind running through the validity of your\nsuggestion, leaving him to wonder just what it could be and how you letting him\ntake you could fit into a plan to protect him.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly an hour later your sneaker hit a thick rock in your hop\nup out of the sand into the rocky climb ahead leading to the arrow shaped rock.\nTenderly his fingers brushed along your palm releasing your hands to aid in\nyour climbing, he hopped up behind you and wet his lips as he pulled himself up\nover another large boulder after you. Around a winding jagged path you trekked\nand walked until he watched you kneel at the base of the rock feature. At the\nbase you shifted a sand covered chunk of amber and dug out a trio of velvet\nwrapped statues you pocketed with the other in your enchanted pouch after Ronan\ngave the trio a curious once over. \u201cThey look like game pieces.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk at him you said, \u201cIn a way they are.\u201d The amber\nwas buried again and you climbed down after your glance up at the yellow sky as\nthe green sun rose to claim the sinking blue sun\u2019s position summoning a wall of\ndust on the horizon. Looking towards the stone city you stated, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to\nstay the night.\u201d He eyed the same wall of dust in the start of your climb as\nyou stated, \u201cThe green sun only makes the air thinner, I zap us out of here\nit\u2019ll ignite.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, \u201cI take it you have allies here as well for\nshelter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne. But I do have some parsnip seeds.\u201d He looked at you\nwhen you jumped down to the sand you sunk in to your ankles. He jumped down\nbeside you and shook each foot free just as you did in your path to the city in\nthe distance.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you travel? Barter your way through the\nuniverse?\u201d</p><p>You giggled again, \u201cWell not all of us have a fleet of blue\nwarriors willing to tear through planets at our beck and call as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now.\u201d</p><p>With another giggle you replied, \u201cDo not promise me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true.\u201d</p><p>You smirked up at him, \u201cYou should probably read through my\nlist of enemies before you go promising me that. I doubt you would after giving\nit a read. More than a few of your allies I imagine.\u201d</p><p>Ronan\u2019s chin tilted and his eyes fell to your hand again,\n\u201cKree do not collect allies.\u201d </p><p>His eyes looked you over as you said, \u201cWell consider yourself\nthe exception.\u201d</p><p>He smirked as he stated, \u201cI did not collect you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded, \u201cNope you just kidnap yours.\u201d Giggling again as\nyour eyes met then broke apart as you faced the city again.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly halfway the temperature dropped as you passed through\nwhat felt to be a icy barrier marking the shift from sand to brittle broken\ngrey earth surrounded by jagged half buried stones. Across a frozen lake you\ncrossed with your hand locked in Ronan\u2019s holding him steady on the climb up\nonto the broken bridge to enter the city just as a blast of frigid icy air blew\nstraight at you. In a shift closer to you Ronan asked, \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people train to withstand great climate shifts.\u201d</p><p>In a giggle as the wind picked up you replied, \u201cSo that\u2019s a\nyes, you\u2019re just too stubborn to admit it.\u201d Making him smirk at your back as\nyou led the way through the city.</p><p>Winding streets later past the surprisingly hundreds of\nscantily clad species between the bundled rarities of visitors eyed you both\ncuriously as the only humanoids in sight until Ronan paused watching your fist\nraise and crash loudly into the metal door at the base of a jagged tower wall\nwith a growing sheet of ice forming on it. Roughly a voice in a tongue he did\nnot recognize called out, <b>\u201cGo away!\u201d</b></p><p>Harshly you shouted back over the growing wind, <b>\u201cNaq, you will\nopen this door!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cNo vacancy!\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come over there myself! I will break your door\ndown!\u201d</b></p><p>A shuffling was heard through the metal, <b>\u201cNo room!\u201d</b></p><p>You nodded, <b>\u201cMore Parsnip seeds for myself then!\u201d</b></p><p>At that a hidden slot on the door opened revealing twelve eyes\non the end of shifting stalks appeared peering at you both as the voice called\nback, <b>\u201cThere is only one bed.\u201d</b></p><p><b>\u201cOpen the door.\u201d</b></p><p>The slot was shut and the door was cracked signaling the\ncrowds around you to halt and dart towards the door, only to fall at the cracks\nin the walls from above opened revealing a set of rotating barrels on a gun\nshooting out spikes at each that dared enter but you and Ronan. The floating\norb of eyes coiled up behind the door you and Ronan slammed then bolted shut\nagain behind you. The warmly lit room grew when you turned to face the\nexpanding orb that turned from a sickly grey to its dark green shade in the\nwarmth again.</p><p>You dug in your pocket for the seeds half of the eyes scanned\nover until you passed the small vial into the tentacle extended for it after it\nstopped in front of the doorway to the room you were offered. Curiously Ronan\nlooked it over as the gleefully popping orb floated to his greenhouse down the\nhall to plant three of the seeds and save the rest for later. As you sat at the\nfoot of the bed Ronan lit the fire in the room before moving to close the door\nleaving you alone again finally then turned to sit beside you to remove his\nboots. </p><p>Before he could say anything he turned his head seeing the\npurple veins showing through your skin under the flannel shirt you set aside\nthen stood. In a deep growl he stated, \u201cYou\u2019re injured!\u201d</p><p>You glanced back at him, \u201cNo. It\u2019s, hard to explain. It\u2019s an\neffect from the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re harming you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m shielding their power until we return to your ship.\u201d\nYou moved to the water basin in the wall fed from a small fountain feeding\nthrough to the wall into the greenhouse next door. Gingerly you smoothed the\nwarm water over your hands and the back of your neck as Ronan turned to look\nback at the bed he eyed then laid in the center of on his right side facing the\nside you had slept on the night before. In his own struggle to remain conscious\nin hopes of making good on your promised affection from earlier his body\nsettled fully clothed under the covers facing away from the door. All at once\ndarkness dropped on the city as the reinforcing shields on the tower rose\nthrough the shouts of the creatures outside bursting into panicked rages for\nshelter from the freezing rain and formerly hidden beasts now diving for them.</p><p>Your eyes shut trying to block out the noise in your mind for\na few moments until the near purring exhales from the shielded Kree brought a\nsmirk to your lips. On the bed you sat trying to grip the blanket only to find\nit tucked under the back of the warrior hoarding the blankets towards his\nfront. Under your breath you mumbled, \u201cOf course you\u2019re a blanket hog.\u201d You\nsighed continuing, \u201cWhat am I supposed to when you\u2019re purring like that, nudge\nyou and say please wake up?\u201d You sighed then flinched at the loud crash\nsounding from outside before you hopped over Ronan. You brushed down the blankets\nthere and laying in the space he had left there and eased them up over your\nshoulder when you laid on your side facing away from him.</p><p>Through the roaring storm and brutal battle outside your eyes\nclosed as you focused on the purring of the giant behind you. Purring that grew\ncloser the deeper you sank into your dreams as his body folded around yours in\na search for the warmth coming from you. Arms gripped you tightly as your legs\ntangled and his face buried in the back of your neck with your loose ponytail\ndraped around the top of his head.\u00a0</p><p>Firmly he held you until the noise outside\nceased at once urging the warrior\u2019s eyes open, a silent mental inspection of\nhis surroundings later his tensing body eased at your soft grumble. A\nstruggling shift later your hips were eased into a more comfortable yet awkward\nlooking position as your legs wove more between his signaling his arms to\ntighten holding you in place while his head pressed more against yours hoping\nto hold this for as long as he could. </p><p>Each moment more precious to him than the last, memorizing\nevery inch of your body pressed against his, even in this form he clung to your\nusing his body as a shield in your sleep while you burrowed deeper under his\nlarge frame making his smile grow through his eyes shutting again. Alone in\nthis silent tundra half to this strange planet fire rippled through his skin as\nhe could feel the contact sealing his bond with his Keeper. True this was\nnormally done in fewer layers but for now this would do, a brush of your hand\non his cheek or even a pressing of your lips to his cheek was what he assumed\nto have earned and yet he\u2019d been granted this marker. An embrace left to bonds\nfirmer than what he\u2019d assumed to have earned before a year had passed.</p><p>Through the door soft music played in discoordinate notes that\nyour host popped along to contently drawing a deeper breath from you making\nRonan grip you tighter in hopes of holding you in place just a few moments\nlonger. A few moments later however his body shifted to rise at yours shifting\nunder him. A pained grunt later he froze eyeing you with hand planted on the\nhard mattress asking, \u201cYour hand, right where it is could you press there on my\nback.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips timidly moving his hand from the rough sheet\nto your bare back under your brushed up shirt, \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Your head nodded, \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>Gradually he added pressure until he heard a clear pop\nfollowed by a pleased grumble from you. Slowly his hand shifted higher on your\nback, following the tension in your muscles that were firmly massaged in his\nrise to straddle your hips as he saw your body relaxing more at his touch, \u201cWas\nmy weight too much for you?\u201d</p><p>You shook your head, \u201cNo.\u201d another pleased sigh left you at\nhis other hand moving higher on your back over its twin. \u201cYou aren\u2019t nearly as\nheavy as you imagine yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other stops?\u201d</p><p>A clang through the door made his hands pull back as he\nstraightened up moving his hands to his thighs to look at the door with\ncuriously furrowed brows. \u201cShould be clear to head back. Just have to say bye\nto the Brucey first though. Just lounging today I think.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and peered down at you when you wiggled onto your\nback under him brushing your hair from your face, \u201cBrucey?\u201d</p><p>As he eased back off you to the foot of the bed he watched\nyour rise to fix your hair and shirt to cover your bra before you both added\nyour shoes. With the bed made you added your flannel again and led the way out\nto the kitchen where the orb eyed you both and grumbled to you in that same\nlanguage from the night before, passing you both a thin tortilla each coated\nwith orange jam you thanked him for then floated back to his greenhouse. Warmly\nRonan\u2019s hand rested on your side and you popped back to your room in his ship\nwhere you shifted him back to his normal form then moved to hop on the bed. On\nyour knees you rested then twisted and plopped onto your back through his eyes\nlooking you over.</p><p>Through your door the noise grew as your eyes closed again\nmaking his brows furrow and sent him into the hall making the noise slowly die\ndown as news of your return spread. Quickly Ronan settled the matters requiring\nhim then returned to find you still asleep, with a determined sigh he turned to leave,\nstraight for the mess hall he went and returned with a floating tray behind him\ncoated in food and drinks. The shift of your mattress stirred your eyes open\nearning a smile from you while his hand moved to ease back the front of your\nflannel eyeing your shoulder ensuring your veins had all turned back from their\nformer purple state. \u201cI brought food. Have you gotten enough rest?\u201d</p><p>You nodded and sat up brushing your hair from your face, \u201cYes.\nWere there problems with me taking you for so long?\u201d</p><p>Ronan shook his head, \u201cNo, just a few squabbles. Nebula has\nbeen trying to gain trust again.\u201d</p><p>Your brow rose, \u201cGain it how, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ronan chuckled shifting your servings closer to you on the\ntray now resting on the legs he pulled out from under the tray to cover both\nyour laps as he faced you with his own legs crossed in front of him. \u201cSeries of\nduels and challenges, as per Kree tradition. Though she hasn\u2019t gained much\nfavor in our absence, it tends to work with the accuser in sight.\u201d</p><p>With a smirk and playfully furrowed brows you asked him, \u201cDid\nyou just refer to yourself in the third person?\u201d</p><p>His eyes rose and he replied, \u201cOh. No. In this instance you\nwould be the accuser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how are duels supposed to gain my trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are meant to prove she is willing and able to serve you\nno matter the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Filling his spoon again he locked his eyes with yours as a\nsmirk eased onto his face, \u201cHmm?\u201d </p><p><a href=\"https://blankdblank.tumblr.com/post/183496802069/prisoner-pt-5\" target=\"_blank\">Pt 5</a></p></p>",

Taking the lead his arm nudged you to the right. &ldquo;Your\nhealing abilities could do wonders for my people. One of our main principles is\nto capture and cleanse any with traits unworthy of our people and those useful\nto us are claimed.&rdquo;</p><p>In a glance up at him you asked, &ldquo;Claimed how?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some are extracted through blood or removal of limbs. Others\nrequire more primitive attempts for carrying on in our people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Meaning breeding?&rdquo; He nodded and you let out a weak giggle,\n&ldquo;So I take it had I a great number for my race they would be captured by\nyours?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; His eyes lingered on you watching your smirk\ngrow, &ldquo;The thought amuses you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I am wondering how many races have been stolen by yours\nto form the ones I have encountered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t taken a race since the mortals a few thousand\nyears back. The Asguardians seemed to grow irritated with it. We abandoned our\nstudies when the hassle outweighed the progress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced up at him with a soft giggle then shook your head\nmaking him look you over, focusing on your curves mainly in an attempt to inspect\nyour breathing. Only to lose his train of thought until your hand on his arm\nbrought his focus back to the present just a few inches from a wall just a foot\nfrom the hall he had been leading you to. In a side step to your right he did\nthe same felling a sting at your hand leaving his arm. The open mess hall ahead\nmade your step pause when the sea of blue heads turned to you each sending\nrespectful bows of their head between Kreeish growls of your title as Ronan&rsquo;s\nKeeper. Through the room Ronan led you to the end of the line asking, &ldquo;What did\nyou wish to eat. You may have your fill of anything we can supply.&rdquo;</p><p>In a glance up at him after eyeing the odd long supply of\nfoods you could not identify, &ldquo;You can pick for me.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked you over then faced forward listing a supply of food\nbefore reaching down and claiming your hand to lead you at his side to his\ntable, also claiming one of the silver cups set on the window opening\nseparating you from the food the others accepted their trays through. You\naccepted the other cup and raised it higher to give it a curious whiff while\nKorath and Gamora placed their orders and accepted their trays. A table in an\nalcove atop a couple steps came into view on your left. Extending his arm he\nguided you up first to claim one of the seats while he accepted the other at\nyour side through a pair of Kree approaching to set plates of tall piles of\nfood in front of you along with a set of spoons.</p><p>Looking you over in their step back he asked, &ldquo;You do not\napprove of your drink?&rdquo;</p><p>Your head turned to look at him, &ldquo;It smells like mangoes.&rdquo;\nRaising it to your lips you blinked through your sip as other Kree in the mess\nhall within sight eyed your reaction. In a stoic face you lowered the\nsurprisingly hot mixture tasting nothing like mangoes, more like green beans\nmixed with honey glazed ham strangely enough. &ldquo;Hmm. Definitely not mangoes.&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced at him after he had taken a sip of his darker\ndrink choice reeking of melted butter on toast that darkened his teeth coating\nit in a thin black layer of liquid<b>,\n&ldquo;Roob.&rdquo;</b> He named his drink in Kreeish at your curious glance in his cup.\n&ldquo;For our warriors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your teeth.&rdquo; After a pause you asked, &ldquo;Does mine change my\nteeth?&rdquo;</p><p>He smirked, &ldquo;No. <b>Gref</b>\ndoes not have those effects. We give it to our Children and Keepers to build\ntheir health on our ships.&rdquo;</p><p>You raised a brow, &ldquo;I am in need of building then?&rdquo;</p><p>He eased his eyes over your face taking in your playful glint\nin your eyes Gamora and Korath missed in their claiming the table behind you\nwith oddly yellow drinks you were too far from to smell you eyed curiously,\n&ldquo;You do not want <b>Nrog</b>.&rdquo; You turned\nto look at him again, &ldquo;It is poison to most races. We supply it for only them,\nto counter the toxins Thanos unleashed in their bodies. Grants them time to\nremain among us before having to return to him for the antidote.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning again you asked Gamora, &ldquo;Does Nebula need that?&rdquo;</p><p>Gamora looked to her glass then shook her head, &ldquo;No. She does\nnot need it. We can survive days without it.&rdquo;</p><p>A snap of your fingers later Nebula dropped heavily with legs\ncrossed jolting her awake to look you over then jump up with dagger drawn until\nyou stated, &ldquo;You should eat.&rdquo;</p><p>Angrily she scowled at you, &ldquo;I do not require sustenance for\nweeks.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick. Eat something, drink your medicine.&rdquo;</p><p>At this she growled, &ldquo;I do not take orders from the likes of you!&rdquo;\n</p><p>Around her the Kree halted and Ronan lowered his glass only to\nremain still at your crossed leg moving to rest against his through his\ngrowling out in Kreeish, &ldquo;<b>Kneel or fall</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes turned to you, &ldquo;I am not in need of sustenance, and I\nwill not respect any who show weakness at the suffering of others!&rdquo;</p><p>With a smile you lowered your glass from a sip of the odd\nliquid, &ldquo;Your respect has little value for me.&rdquo; Those words made her lips part\nand the Kree grow silent as they took in what you had missed as the worst sort\nof insult to their kind marking her even below the worth of a servant, marking\nher as a waste of being in their translation. &ldquo;Life really sucks. I know what\nyou have suffered, and suffer from still. Eat, drink, feel better. When you\nshow me something useful in your book of tricks past being Thanos&rsquo; play thing\nthen we can bring up respect again.&rdquo;</p><p>Inhaling sharply she blinked then seemingly had to jerk her\nbody into moving to turn and claim her place in line through the Kree stealing\nsmirking glances at you as Ronan nipped at his lower lip to contain his pleased\ngrin and raised his spoon from the table. In his first scoop your eyes turned\nto his food as you claimed your own spoon to fill. Curiously you tasted the\nbland yet scalding hot rice like food, eating it stoically until the next\nspoonful that was a jolt of spices and somehow freezing cold. Each bite grew\nmore intriguing until you cleared your plate and finished your drink somehow\nspreading Ronan&rsquo;s grin at your taking to the food so well and being able to\nfinish the large supply so easily.</p><p>Again you were on your feet when two Kree arrived to clear\nyour table. Through the mess hall you felt all eyes on you with pleased smirks\non the faces of the dispersing Warriors all returning to their own quarters and\nposts to either dress or report for duties. Glancing up at him you asked, &ldquo;What\ndo you have planned for today?&rdquo;</p><p>Curiously he blinked at you trying to pinpoint just what\nemotions you were feeling. The jumble of pleasure and intrigue washed through\nhim at once, &ldquo;What did you wish for me to do?&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked up at him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to disturb your duties. I\nimagine you&rsquo;ve a great deal to handle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It can wait.&rdquo;</p><p>Playfully you replied, &ldquo;No it can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; When you reached your\ndoor you tapped the knot by the door on the wall opening the door you passed\nthrough walking backwards, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a busy man. Don&rsquo;t mind me, plenty to keep me\noccupied.&rdquo;</p><p>Curiously he stepped inside with the door closing behind him\nto follow you into the bathroom where he watched you set your makeup bag on the\ncounter by the sink where you had set up a tall mirror. A small dab of eye\nprimer was added to your pinky finger and smoothed on your upper eye lid before\nanother was applied to the other. &ldquo;What will you be doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to make a stop in a Korna.&rdquo; Making his lips part,\n&ldquo;Unless you disapprove.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes lowered to watch you draw out your eye liner and add\na sleek line around your upper lid, &ldquo;I am going with you if you need to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain you have the time? I don&rsquo;t want to take you\nfrom your crew if they need you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not leaving you alone ever. Especially on Korna.&rdquo; He\nshifted to peek in your bag eyeing the eye shadow you chose from after\noutlining your other eye. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Korna, I&rsquo;ve been there dozens of times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The entire planet is filled with scavengers and vagabonds.\nNowhere near worthy of your visit. What business do you have there?&rdquo;</p><p>In a glance at him you let out a weak giggle saying, &ldquo;I\nsuppose you would only feel comfortable leaving me with your crew then. After\nall, they are just like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that were true I would not be their commander.&rdquo;</p><p>With a smirk you opened the square of pale silver to peach eye\nshadows with brush in hand, &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I meant, and you should leave.&rdquo; His\nbrow rose but he did not move, watching you smooth three shades above your eye,\n&ldquo;Unless you want to go dressed like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Flatly he replied, &ldquo;I will require my armor. We do not have\nallies on Korna.&rdquo;</p><p>With a final swipe of your brush you put them away saying,\n&ldquo;Marshmallow it is then.&rdquo;</p><p>In your path to your bedroom again he watched as you pulled\noff your shorts, eyeing the curves the hems of your panties hugged and\naccentuated so perfectly almost drawing a growl from him in his struggle not to\ncross the room to you. Your bend over to dig out a pair of jeans and socks only\nworsening things. In place he stood as you pulled on your socks then bounced\ninto your jeans you added your belt to the loops at the waistband. When you\nglanced up at him you bent to grab your converse and your flannel shirt.</p><p>You crossed the room to him spotting his hungry eyes looking\nyou over then all but smirking openly when your hand planted on his upper arm\nguiding him to turn towards the door. In a low growl he repeated,\n&ldquo;Marshmallow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your alias, remember? First, you need shoes at least.&rdquo; Your hand\ndropped and he hit the knot on the wall by your door leading you out into the\nhall as you pulled on your flannel.&nbsp;</p><p>In his room you stood by the door pulling\non your converse and tied them and stood watching as he grabbed his under shirt\nand chest plate. The slow rippling of his back in his easing the sleeves of his\nshirt over his arms and head through the neck hole almost making him freeze at\nthe rush of an almost starving lust coming from you in your inspection of him.\nThe layer dropped over his back and he turned hearing your steps closer to him.\nThrough a broken inhale his eyes watched as you claimed his chest plate and\nhelped him settle it over his torso before he tightened the sides.</p><p>In a searching gaze over your face you grabbed his socks he&rsquo;d\nset aside and held them between you signaling his hand to rise and claim them\nin his wonder at your now muddled blur of emotions poorly hiding under the\nremaining cloud of lust, making sure to glide his fingers against yours in\nclaiming the pair he pulled on before bending to add his boots.&nbsp;</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Upright again\nhe watched your amused glint in your eyes as his appearance shifted back to the\njean and smurf t shirt wearing doppelganger with scruff and shaggy hair, &ldquo;For\nthe record, I despise this disguise.&rdquo;</p><p>Your smile and soft giggle came with your saying, &ldquo;Stop being\nso cute. You know you enjoy hiding.&rdquo; Before he could say anything you were both\ntransported in the center of a bustling city packed with grime coated\ndilapidated towers around you on a packed street full of passing sneers and\ndiscerning glares at you and Ronan. Firmly his hand claimed yours in your\nguiding him through the street as a voice shouted out in Nian, <b>&ldquo;How about you\nmake me?!&rdquo; </b></p><p>His grip tightened with each block you passed as creature\nafter creature eyed you both in disappointment at the lack of any valuables to\nsteal. In a lean down he growled close to your ear almost dropping himself to\nhis knees at the allured response it drew in you, &ldquo;Next time-.&rdquo;</p><p>At once his voice broke off and his eyes dropped hungrily to\nyour lips just inches from his, &ldquo;Few more minutes then we can get back to your\nship. Next time will be simpler.&rdquo;</p><p>Curiously he eyed your figure in your turn to guide him around\nthe corner and down the next alley where he let out another growl in your\nentering the first beaded string coated doorway on your left. Under furrowed\nbrows he eyed the seedy shop around you with row after row of wooden slat\nformed benches packed with obscure items and weapons. A single glance at you a\nDark Elf left the shop at the sight of you mumbling, &ldquo;I am out of here.&rdquo;\nGrabbing his small honking winged lizard from the ground beside him he mumbled\nto, &ldquo;We have a schedule to keep.&rdquo;</p><p>On his path out however he paused smirking at the small twig\nlike object you drew from your pocket and offered to the lizard that gleefully\nate it while his owner thanked you for the lizard&rsquo;s favorite treat on his\nbirthday, to which you answered, &ldquo;Of course I remembered his favorite!&rdquo;</p><p>Quietly the Elf left and you looked back to the displays as\nRonan lowly asked, &ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced up at him, &ldquo;The Cropiscaner yes. Never met the Elf\nbefore. They demand the treat each year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How exactly do you befriend a Cropiscaner? They are notorious\nfor attacking villages. Full herds have been known to send full planets into collapse.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;Picked him up on Troufless before it exploded.\nThor really didn&rsquo;t trust him, but if you had to choose between an exploding\nplanet or a ship with creatures that could kill you even the worst of the worst\ncould agree to get along.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;True.&rdquo; In another scanning look over you he asked,\n&ldquo;How close to the worst of the worst would you consider Kree to be?&rdquo;</p><p>With a giggle you peered up at him catching his darkening eyes\nlowering to your lips again, &ldquo;I would never consider the Kree to be the worst,\nat anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Your answer drawing a smirk across his lips in your turn and\nstep away to continue your browsing in a determined step and lean forward he\ngrowled lowly beside your ear. &ldquo;Flirtation does not excuse my desire,&rdquo; his eyes\ntraveled over your neck at the row of bumps rising over your skin through the\nnext wave of your emotions coursed through his body and burned in his veins,\n&ldquo;For an answer.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as soon as he&rsquo;d finished his sentence you turned easing\nyour lips just barely a breath from his urging a clear low growling exhale from\nhim in his attempt to announce his sheer invitation for any contact from you. &ldquo;Just\nwhat are you accusing me of?&rdquo; His eyes lowered to your lips in your step back\nto give his hand a tug after your finger tapping just under his chin in what\nyou missed as an all but promised contact later making him smirk again after a nip at his lip.</p><p>Three benches later he peered over your shoulder stealing a\nteasing brush of his free hand&rsquo;s fingers along the strip of skin\non your hip under your shirts when you reached for an crudely carved statue barely a few inches\nlong. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled softly saying, &ldquo;From Morag. Part of my nursery.&rdquo;\nHe nodded and followed you to the counter where the tentacle faced man eyed the\nstatue then you both then smirked at the bag of peppermints you drew from your\nenchanted pouch in your pocket and passed it to him as he handed you the statue\nin a small velvet pouch he slid it into. </p><p>With traded smirks you pocketed your goods and you led the\nshielded warrior through the alley again as he asked, &ldquo;Was that all you\nneeded?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is another planet nearby if you don&rsquo;t mind another\nstop.&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head, &ldquo;Not at all. Wherever you need to go I will\nescort you.&rdquo;</p><p>Locking your eyes with his purple glowing pair you asked, &ldquo;How\nbusy are your days if you can just spend all day following me around.&rdquo; Unable\nto help it his smirk deepened as you added, &ldquo;I just picture you lounging about\nbetween chosen destinations now with your men listening to your tales of Kree Warriors of old.&rdquo;</p><p>.</p><p>A pop later the world changed to a desert coated planet you\nlanded on the outskirt of a small town in the center of nowhere with small\nfabric tents across from a stone formed city in the distance. Under foot the\nsand shifted awkwardly as Ronan walked beside you through the nothingness.\n&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See that arrow shaped column ahead?&rdquo; He nodded, &ldquo;Just past\nthat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what are we searching for?&rdquo; Adjusting his hand to fit\nmore around yours after your unsteady foot sliding off a tipping rock making\nyou bump into his side. &ldquo;Another statue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What use could that statue be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alone, not much to the unknowing eye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To you?&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a weak giggle, &ldquo;My Father left me gifts to find,\nshould I need them. But with Thanos running about it&rsquo;s best I gather them first\nbefore he tries to steal any of them again.&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan, &ldquo;Thanos tried to steal one of your statues?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook you head, &ldquo;No, my tesseract.&rdquo; Ronan&rsquo;s lips parted.</p><p>&ldquo;The tesseract is yours?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded then glanced up at him, &ldquo;Technically the case is\nAsguardian but what it is holding, powering the cube is mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought Loki stole the tesseract?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We came to an agreement.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a stunned giggle drawing his eyes from the blowing\nsand obstructing the path ahead to you, &ldquo;No. A ride home to safety in exchange\nfor tabs on Thanos.&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan, &ldquo;You were Loki&rsquo;s puppet master then.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked up at him, &ldquo;We prefer ally. Heard him in passing\nwhen Frigga sent out word he fell from the Bifrost. She guaranteed the safety\nof my tesseract, I wasn&rsquo;t about to let her Son vanish into the vacuum of space.\nThanos found him, but not until after he heard my whisper in his ear of his\nMother&rsquo;s promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan, &ldquo;How did marriage come about then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has been declared dead a couple times. Needed a place to\nhide. Nowhere near as obstinate as his Brother would lead others to assume.&rdquo; In\nanother glance up at Ronan you smirked, &ldquo;Just like you. So very agreeable for a\nconqueror of worlds. A welcome change, usually I tend to get trapped with\nothers like Nebula.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never meant for you to be harmed.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked again, &ldquo;Only a simple hostage trade right?&rdquo;</p><p>Another squeeze came around your hand, &ldquo;You are not my\nhostage.&rdquo;</p><p>In a giggle you replied, &ldquo;Oh yes. You only have no intention of letting\nme out of your sight ever again, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is only fitting. Healing my Mother has aided my people in\nways you cannot grasp just yet. I would be foolish to repay that by leaving you\nunprotected.&rdquo;</p><p>In a glance up at him you smirked, &ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m not the one\nprotecting you for something, hmm?&rdquo; As you looked forward his lips parted and\nthe thought raced through his mind running through the validity of your\nsuggestion, leaving him to wonder just what it could be and how you letting him\ntake you could fit into a plan to protect him.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly an hour later your sneaker hit a thick rock in your hop\nup out of the sand into the rocky climb ahead leading to the arrow shaped rock.\nTenderly his fingers brushed along your palm releasing your hands to aid in\nyour climbing, he hopped up behind you and wet his lips as he pulled himself up\nover another large boulder after you. Around a winding jagged path you trekked\nand walked until he watched you kneel at the base of the rock feature. At the\nbase you shifted a sand covered chunk of amber and dug out a trio of velvet\nwrapped statues you pocketed with the other in your enchanted pouch after Ronan\ngave the trio a curious once over. &ldquo;They look like game pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>With a smirk at him you said, &ldquo;In a way they are.&rdquo; The amber\nwas buried again and you climbed down after your glance up at the yellow sky as\nthe green sun rose to claim the sinking blue sun&rsquo;s position summoning a wall of\ndust on the horizon. Looking towards the stone city you stated, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to\nstay the night.&rdquo; He eyed the same wall of dust in the start of your climb as\nyou stated, &ldquo;The green sun only makes the air thinner, I zap us out of here\nit&rsquo;ll ignite.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, &ldquo;I take it you have allies here as well for\nshelter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One. But I do have some parsnip seeds.&rdquo; He looked at you\nwhen you jumped down to the sand you sunk in to your ankles. He jumped down\nbeside you and shook each foot free just as you did in your path to the city in\nthe distance.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this how you travel? Barter your way through the\nuniverse?&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled again, &ldquo;Well not all of us have a fleet of blue\nwarriors willing to tear through planets at our beck and call as you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do now.&rdquo;</p><p>With another giggle you replied, &ldquo;Do not promise me that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p><p>You smirked up at him, &ldquo;You should probably read through my\nlist of enemies before you go promising me that. I doubt you would after giving\nit a read. More than a few of your allies I imagine.&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan&rsquo;s chin tilted and his eyes fell to your hand again,\n&ldquo;Kree do not collect allies.&rdquo; </p><p>His eyes looked you over as you said, &ldquo;Well consider yourself\nthe exception.&rdquo;</p><p>He smirked as he stated, &ldquo;I did not collect you.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded, &ldquo;Nope you just kidnap yours.&rdquo; Giggling again as\nyour eyes met then broke apart as you faced the city again.</p><p>.</p><p>Nearly halfway the temperature dropped as you passed through\nwhat felt to be a icy barrier marking the shift from sand to brittle broken\ngrey earth surrounded by jagged half buried stones. Across a frozen lake you\ncrossed with your hand locked in Ronan&rsquo;s holding him steady on the climb up\nonto the broken bridge to enter the city just as a blast of frigid icy air blew\nstraight at you. In a shift closer to you Ronan asked, &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head, &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My people train to withstand great climate shifts.&rdquo;</p><p>In a giggle as the wind picked up you replied, &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a\nyes, you&rsquo;re just too stubborn to admit it.&rdquo; Making him smirk at your back as\nyou led the way through the city.</p><p>Winding streets later past the surprisingly hundreds of\nscantily clad species between the bundled rarities of visitors eyed you both\ncuriously as the only humanoids in sight until Ronan paused watching your fist\nraise and crash loudly into the metal door at the base of a jagged tower wall\nwith a growing sheet of ice forming on it. Roughly a voice in a tongue he did\nnot recognize called out, <b>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;</b></p><p>Harshly you shouted back over the growing wind, <b>&ldquo;Naq, you will\nopen this door!&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;No vacancy!&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me come over there myself! I will break your door\ndown!&rdquo;</b></p><p>A shuffling was heard through the metal, <b>&ldquo;No room!&rdquo;</b></p><p>You nodded, <b>&ldquo;More Parsnip seeds for myself then!&rdquo;</b></p><p>At that a hidden slot on the door opened revealing twelve eyes\non the end of shifting stalks appeared peering at you both as the voice called\nback, <b>&ldquo;There is only one bed.&rdquo;</b></p><p><b>&ldquo;Open the door.&rdquo;</b></p><p>The slot was shut and the door was cracked signaling the\ncrowds around you to halt and dart towards the door, only to fall at the cracks\nin the walls from above opened revealing a set of rotating barrels on a gun\nshooting out spikes at each that dared enter but you and Ronan. The floating\norb of eyes coiled up behind the door you and Ronan slammed then bolted shut\nagain behind you. The warmly lit room grew when you turned to face the\nexpanding orb that turned from a sickly grey to its dark green shade in the\nwarmth again.</p><p>You dug in your pocket for the seeds half of the eyes scanned\nover until you passed the small vial into the tentacle extended for it after it\nstopped in front of the doorway to the room you were offered. Curiously Ronan\nlooked it over as the gleefully popping orb floated to his greenhouse down the\nhall to plant three of the seeds and save the rest for later. As you sat at the\nfoot of the bed Ronan lit the fire in the room before moving to close the door\nleaving you alone again finally then turned to sit beside you to remove his\nboots. </p><p>Before he could say anything he turned his head seeing the\npurple veins showing through your skin under the flannel shirt you set aside\nthen stood. In a deep growl he stated, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re injured!&rdquo;</p><p>You glanced back at him, &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s, hard to explain. It&rsquo;s an\neffect from the pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re harming you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m shielding their power until we return to your ship.&rdquo;\nYou moved to the water basin in the wall fed from a small fountain feeding\nthrough to the wall into the greenhouse next door. Gingerly you smoothed the\nwarm water over your hands and the back of your neck as Ronan turned to look\nback at the bed he eyed then laid in the center of on his right side facing the\nside you had slept on the night before. In his own struggle to remain conscious\nin hopes of making good on your promised affection from earlier his body\nsettled fully clothed under the covers facing away from the door. All at once\ndarkness dropped on the city as the reinforcing shields on the tower rose\nthrough the shouts of the creatures outside bursting into panicked rages for\nshelter from the freezing rain and formerly hidden beasts now diving for them.</p><p>Your eyes shut trying to block out the noise in your mind for\na few moments until the near purring exhales from the shielded Kree brought a\nsmirk to your lips. On the bed you sat trying to grip the blanket only to find\nit tucked under the back of the warrior hoarding the blankets towards his\nfront. Under your breath you mumbled, &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re a blanket hog.&rdquo; You\nsighed continuing, &ldquo;What am I supposed to when you&rsquo;re purring like that, nudge\nyou and say please wake up?&rdquo; You sighed then flinched at the loud crash\nsounding from outside before you hopped over Ronan. You brushed down the blankets\nthere and laying in the space he had left there and eased them up over your\nshoulder when you laid on your side facing away from him.</p><p>Through the roaring storm and brutal battle outside your eyes\nclosed as you focused on the purring of the giant behind you. Purring that grew\ncloser the deeper you sank into your dreams as his body folded around yours in\na search for the warmth coming from you. Arms gripped you tightly as your legs\ntangled and his face buried in the back of your neck with your loose ponytail\ndraped around the top of his head.&nbsp;</p><p>Firmly he held you until the noise outside\nceased at once urging the warrior&rsquo;s eyes open, a silent mental inspection of\nhis surroundings later his tensing body eased at your soft grumble. A\nstruggling shift later your hips were eased into a more comfortable yet awkward\nlooking position as your legs wove more between his signaling his arms to\ntighten holding you in place while his head pressed more against yours hoping\nto hold this for as long as he could. </p><p>Each moment more precious to him than the last, memorizing\nevery inch of your body pressed against his, even in this form he clung to your\nusing his body as a shield in your sleep while you burrowed deeper under his\nlarge frame making his smile grow through his eyes shutting again. Alone in\nthis silent tundra half to this strange planet fire rippled through his skin as\nhe could feel the contact sealing his bond with his Keeper. True this was\nnormally done in fewer layers but for now this would do, a brush of your hand\non his cheek or even a pressing of your lips to his cheek was what he assumed\nto have earned and yet he&rsquo;d been granted this marker. An embrace left to bonds\nfirmer than what he&rsquo;d assumed to have earned before a year had passed.</p><p>Through the door soft music played in discoordinate notes that\nyour host popped along to contently drawing a deeper breath from you making\nRonan grip you tighter in hopes of holding you in place just a few moments\nlonger. A few moments later however his body shifted to rise at yours shifting\nunder him. A pained grunt later he froze eyeing you with hand planted on the\nhard mattress asking, &ldquo;Your hand, right where it is could you press there on my\nback.&rdquo;</p><p>He wet his lips timidly moving his hand from the rough sheet\nto your bare back under your brushed up shirt, &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p><p>Your head nodded, &ldquo;Right there.&rdquo;</p><p>Gradually he added pressure until he heard a clear pop\nfollowed by a pleased grumble from you. Slowly his hand shifted higher on your\nback, following the tension in your muscles that were firmly massaged in his\nrise to straddle your hips as he saw your body relaxing more at his touch, &ldquo;Was\nmy weight too much for you?&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; another pleased sigh left you at\nhis other hand moving higher on your back over its twin. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t nearly as\nheavy as you imagine yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Any other stops?&rdquo;</p><p>A clang through the door made his hands pull back as he\nstraightened up moving his hands to his thighs to look at the door with\ncuriously furrowed brows. &ldquo;Should be clear to head back. Just have to say bye\nto the Brucey first though. Just lounging today I think.&rdquo;</p><p>He smirked and peered down at you when you wiggled onto your\nback under him brushing your hair from your face, &ldquo;Brucey?&rdquo;</p><p>As he eased back off you to the foot of the bed he watched\nyour rise to fix your hair and shirt to cover your bra before you both added\nyour shoes. With the bed made you added your flannel again and led the way out\nto the kitchen where the orb eyed you both and grumbled to you in that same\nlanguage from the night before, passing you both a thin tortilla each coated\nwith orange jam you thanked him for then floated back to his greenhouse. Warmly\nRonan&rsquo;s hand rested on your side and you popped back to your room in his ship\nwhere you shifted him back to his normal form then moved to hop on the bed. On\nyour knees you rested then twisted and plopped onto your back through his eyes\nlooking you over.</p><p>Through your door the noise grew as your eyes closed again\nmaking his brows furrow and sent him into the hall making the noise slowly die\ndown as news of your return spread. Quickly Ronan settled the matters requiring\nhim then returned to find you still asleep, with a determined sigh he turned to leave,\nstraight for the mess hall he went and returned with a floating tray behind him\ncoated in food and drinks. The shift of your mattress stirred your eyes open\nearning a smile from you while his hand moved to ease back the front of your\nflannel eyeing your shoulder ensuring your veins had all turned back from their\nformer purple state. &ldquo;I brought food. Have you gotten enough rest?&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded and sat up brushing your hair from your face, &ldquo;Yes.\nWere there problems with me taking you for so long?&rdquo;</p><p>Ronan shook his head, &ldquo;No, just a few squabbles.
