        "body": "<p>You had\nthought that <i>Brendon\u2019s</i> cold, hard\nstare was the most intimidatingly unnerving one you had ever been on the\nreceiving end of, but it was <i>nothing</i>\ncompared to that of The Director.</p><p>Sitting\non an uncomfortably stiff leather chair in his cube glass office, you felt as\nif you were back in middle school, called into the principal\u2019s office for doing\nsomething wrong. Which, when you made a comparison, wasn\u2019t too far off from the\nactual scenario you were currently immersed in. </p><!-- more --><p>As soon\nas you had arrived back at HQ an hour ago, after having taken a shower and\nsettled a bit, you had been summoned to The Director\u2019s office, where you had\nbeen instructed to take a seat alongside Brendon. Timidly, you slunk into the\nhard chair, shifting awkwardly under The Director\u2019s piercing gaze. You snuck a\nglance at Brendon and even though the both of you knew you were about to\nreceive a talking-to that would make you want to crawl into the deepest,\ndarkest corner of the earth and never come out, your bodyguard looked as calm\nand collected as ever \u2013 jaw taut and radiating coolness and confidence just\nlike he had the first time you saw him.</p><p>Tearing\nyour gaze away from the block of ice sitting next to you, you chanced a look in\nThe Director\u2019s direction. He was sitting behind his desk, resting his elbows on\nit as he steepled his fingers and cast an iron glare on your blanching face.\nYou felt as if he was boring a hole through you and staring into your soul, and\nyou gulped down what minuscule amount of saliva that was left in your mouth. </p><p>The\nscene stayed like this for the better part of an hour; The Director\u2019s gaze\nnever wavered, and neither you nor Brendon dared to move or say anything, even\nthough you were dying to alleviate the daunting silence and tense atmosphere\nthat had fallen over the glass room. </p><p>The\nDirector had a way of using his steely gaze to play with your head in such a\nway that after only a few minutes under his penetrative stare, you were\nsilently praying that he would yell or toss things around in anger, rather than\njust torturing you with silence. But he was perfectly aware of what he was\ndoing, and he continued with his form of silent torture for as long as he\ndeemed necessary. Which, apparently, was fifty-three minutes and thirty-seven\nseconds. </p><p>When he\ndid finally break the silence, he spoke slowly and deliberately and kept his\ntone neutral, so that what he was saying would resound clearly in your and\nBrendon\u2019s heads. </p><p>\u201cWhat,\npray tell,\u201d he started, looking from you to Brendon, \u201cwere you thinking?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t respond at first, and neither did your bodyguard, but when the superior\nbegan tapping his index fingers together as if to say <i>I\u2019m waiting</i>, you let out a short sigh and straightened up in your seat.\nOpening your mouth, you were about to try account for the clear violation of\nrules that had occurred, but your bodyguard beat you to the punch. </p><p>\u201cI was\nthinking that since (Y/N) has been holed up in this place for the past few\nmonths, it would be good for her to get out for a little while,\u201d Brendon said\nsmoothly, the words that held so much trouble spilling from his lips without so\nmuch as a hint of reluctance, \u201cAnd what better day to do it on than her\nbirthday?\u201d</p><p>The\nDirector raised an eyebrow at his agent. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he muttered, \u201cAnd, tell\nme, Agent Urie,\u201d he continued, voice clearer now as he steadied his gaze on the\noffice door behind you two, \u201cthis plan of yours \u2013 the one you amassed to take\n(Y/N) out tonight\u2026 did you think it through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\nthat I had, sir,\u201d he answered, voice unwavering despite the challenge of\nauthority he was facing; you were gobsmacked by his lack of concern, \u201cbut\nunfortunately I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d\ncame the reply. After a moment of no words being spoken, The Director stood up\nand made his way around the desk to the front before he proceeded to lean back\nagainst it, eyes once again darting from you to Brendon. \u201cI could have lost you\ntonight,\u201d he said softly, allowing his facial features to soften for a minute,\n\u201cI could have lost <i>both of you. </i>And\nwhy? All because of some stupid ass decision that <i>you </i>made, Agent,\u201d he spat, pointing an accusatory finger at\nBrendon, who simply clenched his jaw in response.</p><p>\u201cI\nexpected better from you, Urie, I really did,\u201d The Director spoke, rubbing a\nhand over and around his mouth, \u201cYou of all people know how dangerous of a feat\ntonight was. You <i>knew </i>how great of a\npossibility there was that something bad would happen. You <i>knew </i>that she,\u201d he darted his eyes to you, \u201ccould have died. Or\nworse \u2013 captured by Hydra. Now, for someone who is supposed to be protecting\nher at all costs, you tell me,\u201d he leaned in closer to Brendon, \u201cdo you think\nthat the stunt you pulled tonight was a good move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nsir,\u201d Brendon replied. You noticed that his grip on the edge of the chair\u2019s\narmrest had tightened. </p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy the hell did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\njust trying to do something nice,\u201d you interjected, causing Brendon to turn and\nlook at you. The Director, on the other hand, kept his eyes locked on Brendon,\nnot even bothering to glimpse at you.</p><p>\u201cSomething\nnice that could\u2019ve cost you your life,\u201d he countered, making Brendon turn to\nface him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>couldn\u2019t</i> cost me my life?\u201d you huffed,\nrolling your eyes, \u201cFrom the very first moment I set foot in this hellhole,\nI\u2019ve been on lockdown. I felt like a <i>prisoner</i>,\nnot able to go anywhere, do anything, see anyone\u2026 it was driving me insane. So\nBrendon, unlike everyone else around here, decided to do something about it.\nAnd it was the best I\u2019ve felt in a long time, so yes, it wasn\u2019t the smartest of\nmoves, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the dumbest of ones either,\u201d you hissed,\nglaring at your dad\u2019s oldest friend. You thought you caught sight of Brendon\u2019s\nlips curve into a smirk, but you couldn\u2019t be sure. </p><p>\u201cHis job\nis not to take pity on you,\u201d The Director stated, returning your unfriendly\nglare, \u201cHis job is to protect you. And by the looks of it, he hasn\u2019t quite been\nso strict in adhering to what the job entails. I trusted that he was the best\nfit for the job, but now I\u2019m not so sure. Maybe I should reappoint you a new\nbodyguard.\u201d</p><p>With a\nscoff, you stood up from your seat. \u201cLike hell you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nheard me,\u201d you sassed, anger boiling up inside of you, shocking both men with\nyour assertiveness, \u201cBrendon is literally <i>the\nonly reason </i>I\u2019m still alive right now; he\u2019s never failed to protect me. Not\nonce. He\u2019s also a better agent than all of the rest of SHIELD combined, and we\nall know it. You are <i>not </i>reappointing\nme a bodyguard. He stays. Or so help me God, I will turn <i>myself </i>in to Hydra.\u201d</p><p>At\nfirst, both of them just stared at you, no doubt in shock over your sudden\noutburst. Eventually, The Director gave a slow nod, and you were certain that\nyou caught a smirk from Brendon this time around. </p><p>\u201cAlright\nthen,\u201d The Director said, still nodding, \u201cBrendon stays.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled triumphantly. \u201cSo, are we free to leave, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare, yes. I need to speak with Brendon.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring\nthe suspiciousness of the situation, you headed for the door, brushing it off\nas just The Director wanting to reprimand him some more. Sighing, you walked\ndown the hallway to your room.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cSo much\nfeistiness for such a tiny person,\u201d Brendon remarked, referring to your\noutburst in The Director\u2019s office as he leaned against the doorframe of your\nroom, not at all looking like someone who undoubtedly just got yelled at.</p><p>\u201cI am\nnot tiny,\u201d you defended, closing the book you were reading and tossing it back\nonto the pile at the foot of your bed. </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe crossed over to take a seat next to you, \u201ctiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwell, this tiny person just saved your job so\u2026\u201d you pointed out, tossing him a\nsmug look as you brought crossed your legs on the bed, \u201cEven though I know that\nyou were probably aching to get rid of me. But I live to bring you misery,\u201d you\ncheeked. </p><p>Brendon\u2019s\nface turned serious. \u201c(Y/N),\u201d he frowned, and you tilted your head to the side\nin confusion. He studied your face for a while before whispering. \u201cYou know\nthat I\u2019d die before I\u2019d let anything happen to you, right? And I\u2019d never, ever\ndo anything to purposefully put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>You felt\na lump form in your throat that wouldn\u2019t go away no matter how many times you\nswallowed. Your bodyguard was looking at you earnestly, and you stared back\nwith a blank face, caught off guard by what he\u2019d just said. It was unlike him\nto show so much emotion in one night. Or even one month, for that matter. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nyou whispered, nodding, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d\nhe nodded, looking at you the same way he had earlier, in the office.

Which, when you made a comparison, wasn\u2019t too far off from the\nactual scenario you were currently immersed in. </p>[[MORE]]<p>As soon\nas you had arrived back at HQ an hour ago, after having taken a shower and\nsettled a bit, you had been summoned to The Director\u2019s office, where you had\nbeen instructed to take a seat alongside Brendon. Timidly, you slunk into the\nhard chair, shifting awkwardly under The Director\u2019s piercing gaze. You snuck a\nglance at Brendon and even though the both of you knew you were about to\nreceive a talking-to that would make you want to crawl into the deepest,\ndarkest corner of the earth and never come out, your bodyguard looked as calm\nand collected as ever \u2013 jaw taut and radiating coolness and confidence just\nlike he had the first time you saw him.</p><p>Tearing\nyour gaze away from the block of ice sitting next to you, you chanced a look in\nThe Director\u2019s direction. He was sitting behind his desk, resting his elbows on\nit as he steepled his fingers and cast an iron glare on your blanching face.\nYou felt as if he was boring a hole through you and staring into your soul, and\nyou gulped down what minuscule amount of saliva that was left in your mouth. </p><p>The\nscene stayed like this for the better part of an hour; The Director\u2019s gaze\nnever wavered, and neither you nor Brendon dared to move or say anything, even\nthough you were dying to alleviate the daunting silence and tense atmosphere\nthat had fallen over the glass room. </p><p>The\nDirector had a way of using his steely gaze to play with your head in such a\nway that after only a few minutes under his penetrative stare, you were\nsilently praying that he would yell or toss things around in anger, rather than\njust torturing you with silence. But he was perfectly aware of what he was\ndoing, and he continued with his form of silent torture for as long as he\ndeemed necessary. Which, apparently, was fifty-three minutes and thirty-seven\nseconds. </p><p>When he\ndid finally break the silence, he spoke slowly and deliberately and kept his\ntone neutral, so that what he was saying would resound clearly in your and\nBrendon\u2019s heads. </p><p>\u201cWhat,\npray tell,\u201d he started, looking from you to Brendon, \u201cwere you thinking?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t respond at first, and neither did your bodyguard, but when the superior\nbegan tapping his index fingers together as if to say <i>I\u2019m waiting</i>, you let out a short sigh and straightened up in your seat.\nOpening your mouth, you were about to try account for the clear violation of\nrules that had occurred, but your bodyguard beat you to the punch. </p><p>\u201cI was\nthinking that since (Y/N) has been holed up in this place for the past few\nmonths, it would be good for her to get out for a little while,\u201d Brendon said\nsmoothly, the words that held so much trouble spilling from his lips without so\nmuch as a hint of reluctance, \u201cAnd what better day to do it on than her\nbirthday?\u201d</p><p>The\nDirector raised an eyebrow at his agent. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he muttered, \u201cAnd, tell\nme, Agent Urie,\u201d he continued, voice clearer now as he steadied his gaze on the\noffice door behind you two, \u201cthis plan of yours \u2013 the one you amassed to take\n(Y/N) out tonight\u2026 did you think it through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\nthat I had, sir,\u201d he answered, voice unwavering despite the challenge of\nauthority he was facing; you were gobsmacked by his lack of concern, \u201cbut\nunfortunately I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d\ncame the reply. After a moment of no words being spoken, The Director stood up\nand made his way around the desk to the front before he proceeded to lean back\nagainst it, eyes once again darting from you to Brendon. \u201cI could have lost you\ntonight,\u201d he said softly, allowing his facial features to soften for a minute,\n\u201cI could have lost <i>both of you. </i>And\nwhy? All because of some stupid ass decision that <i>you </i>made, Agent,\u201d he spat, pointing an accusatory finger at\nBrendon, who simply clenched his jaw in response.</p><p>\u201cI\nexpected better from you, Urie, I really did,\u201d The Director spoke, rubbing a\nhand over and around his mouth, \u201cYou of all people know how dangerous of a feat\ntonight was. You <i>knew </i>how great of a\npossibility there was that something bad would happen. You <i>knew </i>that she,\u201d he darted his eyes to you, \u201ccould have died. Or\nworse \u2013 captured by Hydra. Now, for someone who is supposed to be protecting\nher at all costs, you tell me,\u201d he leaned in closer to Brendon, \u201cdo you think\nthat the stunt you pulled tonight was a good move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nsir,\u201d Brendon replied. You noticed that his grip on the edge of the chair\u2019s\narmrest had tightened. </p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy the hell did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\njust trying to do something nice,\u201d you interjected, causing Brendon to turn and\nlook at you. The Director, on the other hand, kept his eyes locked on Brendon,\nnot even bothering to glimpse at you.</p><p>\u201cSomething\nnice that could\u2019ve cost you your life,\u201d he countered, making Brendon turn to\nface him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>couldn\u2019t</i> cost me my life?\u201d you huffed,\nrolling your eyes, \u201cFrom the very first moment I set foot in this hellhole,\nI\u2019ve been on lockdown. I felt like a <i>prisoner</i>,\nnot able to go anywhere, do anything, see anyone\u2026 it was driving me insane. So\nBrendon, unlike everyone else around here, decided to do something about it.\nAnd it was the best I\u2019ve felt in a long time, so yes, it wasn\u2019t the smartest of\nmoves, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the dumbest of ones either,\u201d you hissed,\nglaring at your dad\u2019s oldest friend. You thought you caught sight of Brendon\u2019s\nlips curve into a smirk, but you couldn\u2019t be sure. </p><p>\u201cHis job\nis not to take pity on you,\u201d The Director stated, returning your unfriendly\nglare, \u201cHis job is to protect you. And by the looks of it, he hasn\u2019t quite been\nso strict in adhering to what the job entails. I trusted that he was the best\nfit for the job, but now I\u2019m not so sure. Maybe I should reappoint you a new\nbodyguard.\u201d</p><p>With a\nscoff, you stood up from your seat. \u201cLike hell you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nheard me,\u201d you sassed, anger boiling up inside of you, shocking both men with\nyour assertiveness, \u201cBrendon is literally <i>the\nonly reason </i>I\u2019m still alive right now; he\u2019s never failed to protect me. Not\nonce. He\u2019s also a better agent than all of the rest of SHIELD combined, and we\nall know it. You are <i>not </i>reappointing\nme a bodyguard. He stays.

Timidly, you slunk into the\nhard chair, shifting awkwardly under The Director\u2019s piercing gaze. You snuck a\nglance at Brendon and even though the both of you knew you were about to\nreceive a talking-to that would make you want to crawl into the deepest,\ndarkest corner of the earth and never come out, your bodyguard looked as calm\nand collected as ever \u2013 jaw taut and radiating coolness and confidence just\nlike he had the first time you saw him.</p><p>Tearing\nyour gaze away from the block of ice sitting next to you, you chanced a look in\nThe Director\u2019s direction. He was sitting behind his desk, resting his elbows on\nit as he steepled his fingers and cast an iron glare on your blanching face.\nYou felt as if he was boring a hole through you and staring into your soul, and\nyou gulped down what minuscule amount of saliva that was left in your mouth. </p><p>The\nscene stayed like this for the better part of an hour; The Director\u2019s gaze\nnever wavered, and neither you nor Brendon dared to move or say anything, even\nthough you were dying to alleviate the daunting silence and tense atmosphere\nthat had fallen over the glass room. </p><p>The\nDirector had a way of using his steely gaze to play with your head in such a\nway that after only a few minutes under his penetrative stare, you were\nsilently praying that he would yell or toss things around in anger, rather than\njust torturing you with silence. But he was perfectly aware of what he was\ndoing, and he continued with his form of silent torture for as long as he\ndeemed necessary. Which, apparently, was fifty-three minutes and thirty-seven\nseconds. </p><p>When he\ndid finally break the silence, he spoke slowly and deliberately and kept his\ntone neutral, so that what he was saying would resound clearly in your and\nBrendon\u2019s heads. </p><p>\u201cWhat,\npray tell,\u201d he started, looking from you to Brendon, \u201cwere you thinking?\u201d</p><p>You\ndidn\u2019t respond at first, and neither did your bodyguard, but when the superior\nbegan tapping his index fingers together as if to say <i>I\u2019m waiting</i>, you let out a short sigh and straightened up in your seat.\nOpening your mouth, you were about to try account for the clear violation of\nrules that had occurred, but your bodyguard beat you to the punch. </p><p>\u201cI was\nthinking that since (Y/N) has been holed up in this place for the past few\nmonths, it would be good for her to get out for a little while,\u201d Brendon said\nsmoothly, the words that held so much trouble spilling from his lips without so\nmuch as a hint of reluctance, \u201cAnd what better day to do it on than her\nbirthday?\u201d</p><p>The\nDirector raised an eyebrow at his agent. \u201cIs that so?\u201d he muttered, \u201cAnd, tell\nme, Agent Urie,\u201d he continued, voice clearer now as he steadied his gaze on the\noffice door behind you two, \u201cthis plan of yours \u2013 the one you amassed to take\n(Y/N) out tonight\u2026 did you think it through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\nthat I had, sir,\u201d he answered, voice unwavering despite the challenge of\nauthority he was facing; you were gobsmacked by his lack of concern, \u201cbut\nunfortunately I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d\ncame the reply. After a moment of no words being spoken, The Director stood up\nand made his way around the desk to the front before he proceeded to lean back\nagainst it, eyes once again darting from you to Brendon. \u201cI could have lost you\ntonight,\u201d he said softly, allowing his facial features to soften for a minute,\n\u201cI could have lost <i>both of you. </i>And\nwhy? All because of some stupid ass decision that <i>you </i>made, Agent,\u201d he spat, pointing an accusatory finger at\nBrendon, who simply clenched his jaw in response.</p><p>\u201cI\nexpected better from you, Urie, I really did,\u201d The Director spoke, rubbing a\nhand over and around his mouth, \u201cYou of all people know how dangerous of a feat\ntonight was. You <i>knew </i>how great of a\npossibility there was that something bad would happen. You <i>knew </i>that she,\u201d he darted his eyes to you, \u201ccould have died. Or\nworse \u2013 captured by Hydra. Now, for someone who is supposed to be protecting\nher at all costs, you tell me,\u201d he leaned in closer to Brendon, \u201cdo you think\nthat the stunt you pulled tonight was a good move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\nsir,\u201d Brendon replied. You noticed that his grip on the edge of the chair\u2019s\narmrest had tightened. </p><p>\u201cThen\nwhy the hell did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\njust trying to do something nice,\u201d you interjected, causing Brendon to turn and\nlook at you. The Director, on the other hand, kept his eyes locked on Brendon,\nnot even bothering to glimpse at you.</p><p>\u201cSomething\nnice that could\u2019ve cost you your life,\u201d he countered, making Brendon turn to\nface him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat <i>couldn\u2019t</i> cost me my life?\u201d you huffed,\nrolling your eyes, \u201cFrom the very first moment I set foot in this hellhole,\nI\u2019ve been on lockdown. I felt like a <i>prisoner</i>,\nnot able to go anywhere, do anything, see anyone\u2026 it was driving me insane. So\nBrendon, unlike everyone else around here, decided to do something about it.\nAnd it was the best I\u2019ve felt in a long time, so yes, it wasn\u2019t the smartest of\nmoves, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the dumbest of ones either,\u201d you hissed,\nglaring at your dad\u2019s oldest friend. You thought you caught sight of Brendon\u2019s\nlips curve into a smirk, but you couldn\u2019t be sure. </p><p>\u201cHis job\nis not to take pity on you,\u201d The Director stated, returning your unfriendly\nglare, \u201cHis job is to protect you. And by the looks of it, he hasn\u2019t quite been\nso strict in adhering to what the job entails. I trusted that he was the best\nfit for the job, but now I\u2019m not so sure. Maybe I should reappoint you a new\nbodyguard.\u201d</p><p>With a\nscoff, you stood up from your seat. \u201cLike hell you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nheard me,\u201d you sassed, anger boiling up inside of you, shocking both men with\nyour assertiveness, \u201cBrendon is literally <i>the\nonly reason </i>I\u2019m still alive right now; he\u2019s never failed to protect me. Not\nonce. He\u2019s also a better agent than all of the rest of SHIELD combined, and we\nall know it. You are <i>not </i>reappointing\nme a bodyguard. He stays. Or so help me God, I will turn <i>myself </i>in to Hydra.\u201d</p><p>At\nfirst, both of them just stared at you, no doubt in shock over your sudden\noutburst. Eventually, The Director gave a slow nod, and you were certain that\nyou caught a smirk from Brendon this time around. </p><p>\u201cAlright\nthen,\u201d The Director said, still nodding, \u201cBrendon stays.\u201d</p><p>You\nsmiled triumphantly. \u201cSo, are we free to leave, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\nare, yes. I need to speak with Brendon.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring\nthe suspiciousness of the situation, you headed for the door, brushing it off\nas just The Director wanting to reprimand him some more. Sighing, you walked\ndown the hallway to your room.</p><p>~</p><p>\u201cSo much\nfeistiness for such a tiny person,\u201d Brendon remarked, referring to your\noutburst in The Director\u2019s office as he leaned against the doorframe of your\nroom, not at all looking like someone who undoubtedly just got yelled at.</p><p>\u201cI am\nnot tiny,\u201d you defended, closing the book you were reading and tossing it back\nonto the pile at the foot of your bed. </p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d\nhe crossed over to take a seat next to you, \u201ctiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\nwell, this tiny person just saved your job so\u2026\u201d you pointed out, tossing him a\nsmug look as you brought crossed your legs on the bed, \u201cEven though I know that\nyou were probably aching to get rid of me. But I live to bring you misery,\u201d you\ncheeked. </p><p>Brendon\u2019s\nface turned serious. \u201c(Y/N),\u201d he frowned, and you tilted your head to the side\nin confusion. He studied your face for a while before whispering. \u201cYou know\nthat I\u2019d die before I\u2019d let anything happen to you, right? And I\u2019d never, ever\ndo anything to purposefully put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>You felt\na lump form in your throat that wouldn\u2019t go away no matter how many times you\nswallowed. Your bodyguard was looking at you earnestly, and you stared back\nwith a blank face, caught off guard by what he\u2019d just said. It was unlike him\nto show so much emotion in one night. Or even one month, for that matter. </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d\nyou whispered, nodding, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d\nhe nodded, looking at you the same way he had earlier, in the office. Which\nreminded you\u2026</p><p>\u201cBrendon?\u201d\nyou furrowed your brow.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\ndid Fury want to speak to you about?\u201d</p><p>Instead\nof replying, he lifted his hand and brought it to your face, gently cupping it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d he said, \u201cGet some rest. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>___________________________________________________________________________</p><p><i>Thank you for reading x</i></p><p><b>Taglist:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkddIlOym5ZqR9jFPC7rVUQ\">@avangardv</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maPKiSTh-JX43mYWx0T_mLw\">@arosebyname</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUw0T_3yrVFAJa1o8YBtivQ\">@avengertrash21</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWLXO6QZCRXj_4y_5pfhOFg\">@ryan-ross-that-fucking-gay</a></p><p>@azumitoshiki</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSnpoedOApBN8qHK9T4tjUw\">@tiffisnotnormal</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtKwcUYXI1Md9vD8xA6UTQQ\">@darknessdancing</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6N9XN1-YFfC0CUaiVFt11A\">@raversam</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mN0rIvZKAOB2WmmgTqZ8Usg\">@theieroenthusiast</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mr-_J5-z_SwfSgoJNSE3QVw\">@the-ghost-of-hemingway</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m783x5p-duskrCVgx7oufXQ\">@laerkers</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m45SZ7yG1yR3gRhY26Qom1Q\">@peters-vlogs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWu-jqLN6ioDFnUDbhr65-g\">@brendon-is-my-daddy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msdm_yCznOUa46HKDaJbKpw\">@hockeyswag-boll</a></p><p>@gutsbonesandbeauty</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2l82lnRydAGcoz9WACt4qg\">@username-number-01834</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4YJW_TPxgdUHhE3dWSvA3A\">@moosesmoose</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4nRNrpIqTTOAnOa8YOJoTQ\">@underscoredarcy</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwtiH1WLtIhkDdPAMUrKuVw\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwtiH1WLtIhkDdPAMUrKuVw\">@aminasmells</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdcO3rQKWgtEzohttCsOGOQ\">@becausebands</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma3IiU9g4rMIZfVo-GO7f8A\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/ma3IiU9g4rMIZfVo-GO7f8A\">@converseskyline</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEVyoC2oUmRvrCVlKlgHtzA\">@opheren</a></p><p>@justalineinasong15</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9PK0B4K3xK0s2SQLjedgqg\">@vinyloider</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9M6wLcOnc-7x4fyqrNPicg\">@attractiveugly</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOlvgC9AQKVQVD2PAUg_7tA\">@twentzy\u2014dun\u2014fandoms</a></p><p>@tirzahs-heart</p>",

She pulls the door open, her hair rumbled with sleep, a little tank top\nand sleep shorts on. She squints in the bright light, trying to fix her hair.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Y/N squeaks bashful.<br/></p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen before Doll.\u201d He chuckles.<br/></p><p>\u201cUgh, still.\u201d She turns walking away leaving him to follow. He pushes the door\nclosed behind him, watching her shuffle through the house.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere are your keys?\u201d He looks on the table by the door.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She calls, he could smell coffee.<br/></p><p>\u201cCough them up.\u201d He chuckles.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with my car?\u201d She squints at him as she peeks around the\nopening to the kitchen.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having it fixed nosey.\u201d He chuckles softly.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat? How? Why? I didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d She stares at him in shock.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause you raised our daughter on your own for three years and this is only\nthe start of what I owe you, so give up the keys, babe.\u201d He smirks at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where they are.\u201d She scratches the side of her head a little\nashamed.<br/></p><p>\u201cMan, somethings just don\u2019t change.\u201d He shakes his head, setting about to find\nthe keys.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She points at him, he laughs. \u201cI might have left them on my dresser.\u201d\nShe groans. <br/></p><p>He waves her off and jogs up the stairs towards the master bedroom.\nHe pushes open the door, he looks around from the dresser by the door, that\nused to house his things, it sat empty now. He moves to the night stands, only\none side of her bed unmade. Nothing on the other side he used to occupy, except\na box in the open slot under the table top. His fingers pull it out, a condom\nbox. <br/></p><p>Jealousy and anger bubbled in his chest, even though he knew he had no right.\nWas he stepping in on something? He never saw her with anyone else. She kissed\nhim last night. He shakes his head, it doesn\u2019t matter, this was his family, who\never this guy was he was gone. Y/N and Aria were his and he would make sure it\nwas that way before this guy came sniffing around again.<br/></p><p>\u201cHey I found,\u201d she stops behind him \u201cthem.\u201d She finishes slowly. <br/></p><p>\u201cAm I stepping in on something?\u201d He drops the box on the nightstand top.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head, blinking bright eyes at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He tips his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cI have a friend?\u201d She shrugs, sounding unsure. \u201cOnce in a while we sleep\ntogether. He\u2019s never met Ari, he\u2019s never met mom, dad would hate him. He called\nthe other day and wanted to get together.\u201d She waves her hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cGet together?\u201d Steve\u2019s brow snaps up, scuffing at the words. Sure, he\u2019d slept\nwith other woman, but he never stuck to one. He used them to get off, but every\ntime he was inside someone else he could only picture Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t judge me Steven. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been real chaste\nsince you bailed on me.\u201d She rolls her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never met Ari?\u201d He mutters, his jaw clenched, the idea\nof another man around his daughter lights something deep and dark in his chest.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, god you idiot. I didn\u2019t just introduce her to an Tom, Dick and Henry I\nslept with.\u201d You flicks him in the neck.<br/></p><p>\u201cBeen that many?\u201d He smirks at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She throws her hands up.<br/></p><p>\u201cI hate him.\u201d He turns picking up the box and throwing it in the little trash\nbin next to the dresser.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah well I\u2019m sure he hates you too.\u201d She rolls her eyes again.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d He smirks.<br/></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve never had anything serious more than a date,\nliterally they never get past the first date, and why I settled with a fuck\nbuddy. No feelings, no strings, no way to hurt me.\u201d She waves him off.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou know what this means Y/N.\u201d His voice set, deep and serious.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She mutters refusing to look up at him. His fingers grip her jaw, not\nharsh, just enough to get her to look up.<br/></p><p>\u201cI find him here. I find him near you. I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d His brows lifted, as he\nstares down at her. She gives a half nod, blinking in surprise. He leans in\nplacing a chaste kiss on her lips. He takes the keys from her hand, heading for\nthe door. \u201cGet dressed and maybe I\u2019ll take you for ice cream while we study.\u201d\nHe smirks at her. Her mouth smooshed together as if she was pouting. \u201cAnd if\nyou need a fuck buddy, we can add that to the list of things we need to\ndiscuss.\u201d He winks and walks out.<br/></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She calls after him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He calls back jogging back down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThings all good?\u201d Sam and Peter chuckle, leaning on the\nporch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Peter you grew up here. Any secluded area?\u201d He smirks\nslapping the keys to Y/N\u2019s car into Sam\u2019s hand.<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah a few miles out of town.\u201d Peter chuckles.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat did you kill her?\u201d Sam snorts.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo his ego is just massive and he\u2019s a one possessive ass.\u201d Y/N adds from the doorway.\nThe three of them turn looking at her. She\u2019s dressed in a little teal colored\nsundress, that hangs off her frame and stops around her thighs.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d He shrugs.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo many things I could say right now.\u201d She glares at him.<br/></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be studying?\u201d He cocks his eyebrow at her.<br/></p><p>\u201cMom called. She said she\u2019s making brunch, and Ari asked if you were coming\nover again.\u201d She smirks.<br/></p><p>\u201cReally? She asked about me?\u201d He breaks into a massive grin, he was a pussy ass\nsofty when it came to Ari and Y/N.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes wanted to know if you would come over, apparently she\u2019s been talking to\nNana none stop about you.\u201d She looks almost smug.<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take my truck.\u201d He grins.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf you plan for ice cream later, you have to take Ari this time or you\u2019ll never\nhear the end of it.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ll need the car seat out of my Four\nRunner.\u201d She tips her head.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot to be nosey, but who is Ari?\u201d Sam lifts his hand looking around.<br/></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s daughter.\u201d Y/N smirks.<br/></p><p>\u201cAYYYY!\u201d Peter and Sam cheer at the same time, making Y/N laugh. They pat Steve\non the back, congratulating him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the car seat, you get those cards, you\u2019re studying today.\u201d He points\nat her, she rolls her eyes and disappears into the house.</p><hr><p><b>AU Summer Tag List:</b> (Open still)<br/><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5JRss-OXjnC1DH8O4QPBBA\">@doa1518</a> \u00a0 \u00a0<br/><a

She pulls the door open, her hair rumbled with sleep, a little tank top\nand sleep shorts on. She squints in the bright light, trying to fix her hair.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Y/N squeaks bashful.<br></p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen before Doll.\u201d He chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cUgh, still.\u201d She turns walking away leaving him to follow. He pushes the door\nclosed behind him, watching her shuffle through the house.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere are your keys?\u201d He looks on the table by the door.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She calls, he could smell coffee.<br></p><p>\u201cCough them up.\u201d He chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with my car?\u201d She squints at him as she peeks around the\nopening to the kitchen.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having it fixed nosey.\u201d He chuckles softly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? How? Why? I didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d She stares at him in shock.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause you raised our daughter on your own for three years and this is only\nthe start of what I owe you, so give up the keys, babe.\u201d He smirks at her.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where they are.\u201d She scratches the side of her head a little\nashamed.<br></p><p>\u201cMan, somethings just don\u2019t change.\u201d He shakes his head, setting about to find\nthe keys.<br></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She points at him, he laughs. \u201cI might have left them on my dresser.\u201d\nShe groans. <br></p><p>He waves her off and jogs up the stairs towards the master bedroom.\nHe pushes open the door, he looks around from the dresser by the door, that\nused to house his things, it sat empty now. He moves to the night stands, only\none side of her bed unmade. Nothing on the other side he used to occupy, except\na box in the open slot under the table top. His fingers pull it out, a condom\nbox. <br></p><p>Jealousy and anger bubbled in his chest, even though he knew he had no right.\nWas he stepping in on something? He never saw her with anyone else. She kissed\nhim last night. He shakes his head, it doesn\u2019t matter, this was his family, who\never this guy was he was gone. Y/N and Aria were his and he would make sure it\nwas that way before this guy came sniffing around again.<br></p><p>\u201cHey I found,\u201d she stops behind him \u201cthem.\u201d She finishes slowly. <br></p><p>\u201cAm I stepping in on something?\u201d He drops the box on the nightstand top.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head, blinking bright eyes at him.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He tips his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI have a friend?\u201d She shrugs, sounding unsure. \u201cOnce in a while we sleep\ntogether. He\u2019s never met Ari, he\u2019s never met mom, dad would hate him. He called\nthe other day and wanted to get together.\u201d She waves her hand.<br></p><p>\u201cGet together?\u201d Steve\u2019s brow snaps up, scuffing at the words. Sure, he\u2019d slept\nwith other woman, but he never stuck to one. He used them to get off, but every\ntime he was inside someone else he could only picture Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t judge me Steven. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been real chaste\nsince you bailed on me.\u201d She rolls her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never met Ari?\u201d He mutters, his jaw clenched, the idea\nof another man around his daughter lights something deep and dark in his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, god you idiot. I didn\u2019t just introduce her to an Tom, Dick and Henry I\nslept with.\u201d You flicks him in the neck.<br></p><p>\u201cBeen that many?\u201d He smirks at her.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She throws her hands up.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate him.\u201d He turns picking up the box and throwing it in the little trash\nbin next to the dresser.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah well I\u2019m sure he hates you too.\u201d She rolls her eyes again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d He smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve never had anything serious more than a date,\nliterally they never get past the first date, and why I settled with a fuck\nbuddy. No feelings, no strings, no way to hurt me.\u201d She waves him off.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what this means Y/N.\u201d His voice set, deep and serious.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She mutters refusing to look up at him. His fingers grip her jaw, not\nharsh, just enough to get her to look up.<br></p><p>\u201cI find him here. I find him near you. I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d His brows lifted, as he\nstares down at her. She gives a half nod, blinking in surprise. He leans in\nplacing a chaste kiss on her lips. He takes the keys from her hand, heading for\nthe door. \u201cGet dressed and maybe I\u2019ll take you for ice cream while we study.\u201d\nHe smirks at her. Her mouth smooshed together as if she was pouting. \u201cAnd if\nyou need a fuck buddy, we can add that to the list of things we need to\ndiscuss.\u201d He winks and walks out.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She calls after him.<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He calls back jogging back down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThings all good?\u201d Sam and Peter chuckle, leaning on the\nporch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Peter you grew up here. Any secluded area?\u201d He smirks\nslapping the keys to Y/N\u2019s car into Sam\u2019s hand.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah a few miles out of town.\u201d Peter chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat did you kill her?\u201d Sam snorts.<br></p><p>\u201cNo his ego is just massive and he\u2019s a one possessive ass.\u201d Y/N adds from the doorway.\nThe three of them turn looking at her. She\u2019s dressed in a little teal colored\nsundress, that hangs off her frame and stops around her thighs.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d He shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cSo many things I could say right now.\u201d She glares at him.<br></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be studying?\u201d He cocks his eyebrow at her.<br></p><p>\u201cMom called. She said she\u2019s making brunch, and Ari asked if you were coming\nover again.\u201d She smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cReally? She asked about me?\u201d He breaks into a massive grin, he was a pussy ass\nsofty when it came to Ari and Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cYes wanted to know if you would come over, apparently she\u2019s been talking to\nNana none stop about you.\u201d She looks almost smug.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take my truck.\u201d He grins.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you plan for ice cream later, you have to take Ari this time or you\u2019ll never\nhear the end of it.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ll need the car seat out of my Four\nRunner.\u201d She tips her head.<br></p><p>\u201cNot to be nosey, but who is Ari?\u201d Sam lifts his hand looking around.<br></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s daughter.\u201d Y/N smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cAYYYY!\u201d Peter and Sam cheer at the same time, making Y/N laugh. They pat Steve\non the back, congratulating him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the car seat, you get those cards, you\u2019re studying today.\u201d He points\nat her, she rolls her eyes and disappears into the house.</p><hr><p><b>AU Summer Tag List:</b> (Open still)<br><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5JRss-OXjnC1DH8O4QPBBA\">@doa1518</a> \u00a0 \u00a0<br><a class=\"tumblelog\"

She pulls the door open, her hair rumbled with sleep, a little tank top\nand sleep shorts on. She squints in the bright light, trying to fix her hair.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Y/N squeaks bashful.<br></p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen before Doll.\u201d He chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cUgh, still.\u201d She turns walking away leaving him to follow. He pushes the door\nclosed behind him, watching her shuffle through the house.<br></p><p>\u201cWhere are your keys?\u201d He looks on the table by the door.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She calls, he could smell coffee.<br></p><p>\u201cCough them up.\u201d He chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with my car?\u201d She squints at him as she peeks around the\nopening to the kitchen.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having it fixed nosey.\u201d He chuckles softly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat? How? Why? I didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d She stares at him in shock.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause you raised our daughter on your own for three years and this is only\nthe start of what I owe you, so give up the keys, babe.\u201d He smirks at her.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure where they are.\u201d She scratches the side of her head a little\nashamed.<br></p><p>\u201cMan, somethings just don\u2019t change.\u201d He shakes his head, setting about to find\nthe keys.<br></p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She points at him, he laughs. \u201cI might have left them on my dresser.\u201d\nShe groans. <br></p><p>He waves her off and jogs up the stairs towards the master bedroom.\nHe pushes open the door, he looks around from the dresser by the door, that\nused to house his things, it sat empty now. He moves to the night stands, only\none side of her bed unmade. Nothing on the other side he used to occupy, except\na box in the open slot under the table top. His fingers pull it out, a condom\nbox. <br></p><p>Jealousy and anger bubbled in his chest, even though he knew he had no right.\nWas he stepping in on something? He never saw her with anyone else. She kissed\nhim last night. He shakes his head, it doesn\u2019t matter, this was his family, who\never this guy was he was gone. Y/N and Aria were his and he would make sure it\nwas that way before this guy came sniffing around again.<br></p><p>\u201cHey I found,\u201d she stops behind him \u201cthem.\u201d She finishes slowly. <br></p><p>\u201cAm I stepping in on something?\u201d He drops the box on the nightstand top.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head, blinking bright eyes at him.<br></p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He tips his head.<br></p><p>\u201cI have a friend?\u201d She shrugs, sounding unsure. \u201cOnce in a while we sleep\ntogether. He\u2019s never met Ari, he\u2019s never met mom, dad would hate him. He called\nthe other day and wanted to get together.\u201d She waves her hand.<br></p><p>\u201cGet together?\u201d Steve\u2019s brow snaps up, scuffing at the words. Sure, he\u2019d slept\nwith other woman, but he never stuck to one. He used them to get off, but every\ntime he was inside someone else he could only picture Y/N\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t judge me Steven. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been real chaste\nsince you bailed on me.\u201d She rolls her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never met Ari?\u201d He mutters, his jaw clenched, the idea\nof another man around his daughter lights something deep and dark in his chest.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, god you idiot. I didn\u2019t just introduce her to an Tom, Dick and Henry I\nslept with.\u201d You flicks him in the neck.<br></p><p>\u201cBeen that many?\u201d He smirks at her.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She throws her hands up.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate him.\u201d He turns picking up the box and throwing it in the little trash\nbin next to the dresser.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah well I\u2019m sure he hates you too.\u201d She rolls her eyes again.<br></p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d He smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the reason I\u2019ve never had anything serious more than a date,\nliterally they never get past the first date, and why I settled with a fuck\nbuddy. No feelings, no strings, no way to hurt me.\u201d She waves him off.<br></p><p>\u201cYou know what this means Y/N.\u201d His voice set, deep and serious.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She mutters refusing to look up at him. His fingers grip her jaw, not\nharsh, just enough to get her to look up.<br></p><p>\u201cI find him here. I find him near you. I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d His brows lifted, as he\nstares down at her. She gives a half nod, blinking in surprise. He leans in\nplacing a chaste kiss on her lips. He takes the keys from her hand, heading for\nthe door. \u201cGet dressed and maybe I\u2019ll take you for ice cream while we study.\u201d\nHe smirks at her. Her mouth smooshed together as if she was pouting. \u201cAnd if\nyou need a fuck buddy, we can add that to the list of things we need to\ndiscuss.\u201d He winks and walks out.<br></p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She calls after him.<br></p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He calls back jogging back down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThings all good?\u201d Sam and Peter chuckle, leaning on the\nporch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Peter you grew up here. Any secluded area?\u201d He smirks\nslapping the keys to Y/N\u2019s car into Sam\u2019s hand.<br></p><p>\u201cYeah a few miles out of town.\u201d Peter chuckles.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat did you kill her?\u201d Sam snorts.<br></p><p>\u201cNo his ego is just massive and he\u2019s a one possessive ass.\u201d Y/N adds from the doorway.\nThe three of them turn looking at her. She\u2019s dressed in a little teal colored\nsundress, that hangs off her frame and stops around her thighs.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t share what\u2019s mine.\u201d He shrugs.<br></p><p>\u201cSo many things I could say right now.\u201d She glares at him.<br></p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be studying?\u201d He cocks his eyebrow at her.<br></p><p>\u201cMom called. She said she\u2019s making brunch, and Ari asked if you were coming\nover again.\u201d She smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cReally? She asked about me?\u201d He breaks into a massive grin, he was a pussy ass\nsofty when it came to Ari and Y/N.<br></p><p>\u201cYes wanted to know if you would come over, apparently she\u2019s been talking to\nNana none stop about you.\u201d She looks almost smug.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take my truck.\u201d He grins.<br></p><p>\u201cIf you plan for ice cream later, you have to take Ari this time or you\u2019ll never\nhear the end of it.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ll need the car seat out of my Four\nRunner.\u201d She tips her head.<br></p><p>\u201cNot to be nosey, but who is Ari?\u201d Sam lifts his hand looking around.<br></p><p>\u201cSteve\u2019s daughter.\u201d Y/N smirks.<br></p><p>\u201cAYYYY!\u201d Peter and Sam cheer at the same time, making Y/N laugh. They pat Steve\non the back, congratulating him.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the car seat, you get those cards, you\u2019re studying today.\u201d He points\nat her, she rolls her eyes and disappears into the house.</p><hr><p><b>AU Summer Tag List:</b> (Open still)<br><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5JRss-OXjnC1DH8O4QPBBA\">@doa1518</a> \u00a0 \u00a0<br><a class=\"tumblelog\"

She pulls the door open, her hair rumbled with sleep, a little tank top\nand sleep shorts on. She squints in the bright light, trying to fix her hair.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re early.&rdquo; Y/N squeaks bashful.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nothing I haven&rsquo;t seen before Doll.&rdquo; He chuckles.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, still.&rdquo; She turns walking away leaving him to follow. He pushes the door\nclosed behind him, watching her shuffle through the house.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where are your keys?&rdquo; He looks on the table by the door.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She calls, he could smell coffee.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Cough them up.&rdquo; He chuckles.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you want with my car?&rdquo; She squints at him as she peeks around the\nopening to the kitchen.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having it fixed nosey.&rdquo; He chuckles softly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What? How? Why? I didn&rsquo;t ask you to do that.&rdquo; She stares at him in shock.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because you raised our daughter on your own for three years and this is only\nthe start of what I owe you, so give up the keys, babe.&rdquo; He smirks at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure where they are.&rdquo; She scratches the side of her head a little\nashamed.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Man, somethings just don&rsquo;t change.&rdquo; He shakes his head, setting about to find\nthe keys.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; She points at him, he laughs. &ldquo;I might have left them on my dresser.&rdquo;\nShe groans. <br /></p><p>He waves her off and jogs up the stairs towards the master bedroom.\nHe pushes open the door, he looks around from the dresser by the door, that\nused to house his things, it sat empty now. He moves to the night stands, only\none side of her bed unmade. Nothing on the other side he used to occupy, except\na box in the open slot under the table top. His fingers pull it out, a condom\nbox. <br /></p><p>Jealousy and anger bubbled in his chest, even though he knew he had no right.\nWas he stepping in on something? He never saw her with anyone else. She kissed\nhim last night. He shakes his head, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, this was his family, who\never this guy was he was gone. Y/N and Aria were his and he would make sure it\nwas that way before this guy came sniffing around again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey I found,&rdquo; she stops behind him &ldquo;them.&rdquo; She finishes slowly. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Am I stepping in on something?&rdquo; He drops the box on the nightstand top.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shakes her head, blinking bright eyes at him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; He tips his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have a friend?&rdquo; She shrugs, sounding unsure. &ldquo;Once in a while we sleep\ntogether. He&rsquo;s never met Ari, he&rsquo;s never met mom, dad would hate him. He called\nthe other day and wanted to get together.&rdquo; She waves her hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Get together?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s brow snaps up, scuffing at the words. Sure, he&rsquo;d slept\nwith other woman, but he never stuck to one. He used them to get off, but every\ntime he was inside someone else he could only picture Y/N&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t judge me Steven. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been real chaste\nsince you bailed on me.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes at him.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never met Ari?&rdquo; He mutters, his jaw clenched, the idea\nof another man around his daughter lights something deep and dark in his chest.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, god you idiot. I didn&rsquo;t just introduce her to an Tom, Dick and Henry I\nslept with.&rdquo; You flicks him in the neck.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Been that many?&rdquo; He smirks at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; She throws her hands up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I hate him.&rdquo; He turns picking up the box and throwing it in the little trash\nbin next to the dresser.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah well I&rsquo;m sure he hates you too.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes again.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He smirks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re the reason I&rsquo;ve never had anything serious more than a date,\nliterally they never get past the first date, and why I settled with a fuck\nbuddy. No feelings, no strings, no way to hurt me.&rdquo; She waves him off.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You know what this means Y/N.&rdquo; His voice set, deep and serious.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She mutters refusing to look up at him. His fingers grip her jaw, not\nharsh, just enough to get her to look up.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I find him here. I find him near you. I&rsquo;ll kill him.&rdquo; His brows lifted, as he\nstares down at her. She gives a half nod, blinking in surprise. He leans in\nplacing a chaste kiss on her lips. He takes the keys from her hand, heading for\nthe door. &ldquo;Get dressed and maybe I&rsquo;ll take you for ice cream while we study.&rdquo;\nHe smirks at her. Her mouth smooshed together as if she was pouting. &ldquo;And if\nyou need a fuck buddy, we can add that to the list of things we need to\ndiscuss.&rdquo; He winks and walks out.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I hate you.&rdquo; She calls after him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; He calls back jogging back down the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Things all good?&rdquo; Sam and Peter chuckle, leaning on the\nporch.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Peter you grew up here. Any secluded area?&rdquo; He smirks\nslapping the keys to Y/N&rsquo;s car into Sam&rsquo;s hand.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah a few miles out of town.&rdquo; Peter chuckles.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What did you kill her?&rdquo; Sam snorts.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No his ego is just massive and he&rsquo;s a one possessive ass.&rdquo; Y/N adds from the doorway.\nThe three of them turn looking at her. She&rsquo;s dressed in a little teal colored\nsundress, that hangs off her frame and stops around her thighs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t share what&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; He shrugs.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So many things I could say right now.&rdquo; She glares at him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be studying?&rdquo; He cocks his eyebrow at her.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mom called. She said she&rsquo;s making brunch, and Ari asked if you were coming\nover again.&rdquo; She smirks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Really? She asked about me?&rdquo; He breaks into a massive grin, he was a pussy ass\nsofty when it came to Ari and Y/N.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes wanted to know if you would come over, apparently she&rsquo;s been talking to\nNana none stop about you.&rdquo; She looks almost smug.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take my truck.&rdquo; He grins.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If you plan for ice cream later, you have to take Ari this time or you&rsquo;ll never\nhear the end of it.&rdquo; She shrugs. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need the car seat out of my Four\nRunner.&rdquo; She tips her head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not to be nosey, but who is Ari?&rdquo; Sam lifts his hand looking around.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Steve&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; Y/N smirks.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;AYYYY!&rdquo; Peter and Sam cheer at the same time, making Y/N laugh. They pat Steve\non the back, congratulating him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the car seat, you get those cards, you&rsquo;re studying today.&rdquo; He points\nat her, she rolls her eyes and disappears into the house.</p><hr /><p><b>AU Summer Tag List:</b> (Open still)<br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5JRss-OXjnC1DH8O4QPBBA\">@doa1518</a> &nbsp;

I sat upon a window seat that outlooked the forest  outside the Avengers tower. The rain hit the window in such calming patterns. It was nice to finally be home after a long mission. </p><p>A knock came across my door pulling my.out of my thoughts. I slowly trudged my way to the door and opened it. Behind the door stood Clint, he and I have been friends for a good amount of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it seems that everyone else is busy. Wanna go to town and get a drink&rdquo; I looked down to my clothes and back up. Clint was in a black button up and some nice jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but first I&rsquo;ll need to change&rdquo; Clint nodded and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the living area&rdquo; I closed the door and turned around. My closet was pretty decent in size, but I didn&rsquo;t have very many clothing options.</p><p>Quickly I grabbed some jeans, a shirt, and a leather jacket. There wasn&rsquo;t anything else I needed after changing, that&rsquo;s until I passed the mirror. My hair was thrown around. I grabbed my brush and powered through the tangles and hurried out the door.</p><p>The halls were slightly dark from the storm. It was pretty peaceful. As I walked down the hall I looked through the room that I passed. Everyone was working at something, or sleeping. </p><p>As he said, Clint was down in the living area. He sat watching some boring show. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready&rdquo; Clint slightly jumped and turned. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; He stood and walked around the couch. We walked to the door and were met with a cash of lightning. He chuckled and held the door open.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; He nodded and stepped out himself. As we walked I constantly looked up at the lightning and rain. Clint opened the door for me. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; I chuckled again. He got in as I shut mine. It was a dark car, but it was simple. Clint started up the car and we began our journey to town.</p><p>About 30 minutes later we arrived into town. The whole ride consisted of us talking about the mission and things that we missed out on while we were gone. Once we arrive I quickly got out before he could open my door.</p><p>&ldquo;That was my job&rdquo; Clint walked around the car with his arms crossed. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I took matters into my own hands&rdquo; He jokingly rolled his eyes and walked towards the door. Of course he held it open for me. I stuck my tongue out and he just smiled.</p><p>The bar wasn&rsquo;t too packed, just a few men and women conversing. Clint motioned for me to sit next to him at the bar. </p><p>&ldquo;Two beers&rdquo; He flagged down the bartender and she took notice. She passed us the drinks and leaned against the table.</p><p>&ldquo;If.I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you must be Hawkeye&rdquo; She smiled a white grin and I sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am&rdquo; Clint took a swig if his beer and chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to thank you for saving New York. It would have been much worse if you weren&rsquo;t there&rdquo; The lady walked away to take an order. Clint looked at me, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed I had a disgusted look on my face.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I shook my head and looked away as she came back.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, my name&rsquo;s Jackie&rdquo; She stuck her hand out and waited for his.</p><p>&ldquo;Clint&rdquo; He responded while shaking her hand. </p><p>The night continued on with them talking. Do It drinks in and I began to realize how much I really liked him. I sighed and stood up. My balance was still decent. I walked out the door and into the pouring rain. Clint probably wouldn&rsquo;t notice I was gone anyways.</p><p>After some time I heard a scoff. I turned my head to see Clint staring down at me. Standing up from the bench I fixed my wet hair and looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Clint shook his head and started walking off. I followed behind him slowly trying to avoid conversation. He got into the drivers side and I got in the passenger side. We sat for a few minutes in silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you walk out&rdquo; He turned and looked at me as he said that.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt your conversation with&hellip;Jackie&rdquo; Clint rolled his eyes and laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Wowww. Really?&rdquo; I looked at the ground and kept my eyes on my feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,She was all over you&rdquo; He looked at me and rose a brow.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Wait a minute. Are you jealous</b>?&rdquo; My face grew red as I looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;So what if I am. Ever since I moved here I&rsquo;ve liked you. Is it a sin? I let my self fall for you even though I have no chance in hell.&rdquo; Clint&rsquo;s eyes widened and he began to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Have I entered an alternate universe.or did you really just admit that you like me?</b>&rdquo; The car went silent and all that was heard was rain.</p><p>&ldquo;Just- I- Stop asking questions&rdquo; By now my face was bright red and I was regretting everything. He started up the car and we headed back.</p><p>Once we got back it was storming much harder. The two of us quickly got out of the car and ran up to the building. Before I opened the door Clint grabbed my arm. The sudden movement turned me around to face him. Clint leaned forward and his lips landed on mine. My heart began to beat really fast. My hand rested on his cheek as we backed out of the kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;All you had to say was that you liked me and I would&rsquo;ve considered that a date&rdquo; We both chuckled. He dragged me inside the building and we sat on the couch watching movies all night.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"imaginary-desires:whCKMQJpA1ELbUhnduFBFw:ZZJDLd2SVYUjm\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c902e956928844ac66b4fc64dbe99ce/tumblr_ozh714nSjq1wvuj0co1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>",

I sat upon a window seat that outlooked the forest  outside the Avengers tower. The rain hit the window in such calming patterns. It was nice to finally be home after a long mission. </p><p>A knock came across my door pulling my.out of my thoughts. I slowly trudged my way to the door and opened it. Behind the door stood Clint, he and I have been friends for a good amount of time. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it seems that everyone else is busy. Wanna go to town and get a drink&rdquo; I looked down to my clothes and back up. Clint was in a black button up and some nice jeans.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but first I&rsquo;ll need to change&rdquo; Clint nodded and smiled.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the living area&rdquo; I closed the door and turned around. My closet was pretty decent in size, but I didn&rsquo;t have very many clothing options.</p><p>Quickly I grabbed some jeans, a shirt, and a leather jacket. There wasn&rsquo;t anything else I needed after changing, that&rsquo;s until I passed the mirror. My hair was thrown around. I grabbed my brush and powered through the tangles and hurried out the door.</p><p>The halls were slightly dark from the storm. It was pretty peaceful. As I walked down the hall I looked through the room that I passed. Everyone was working at something, or sleeping. </p><p>As he said, Clint was down in the living area. He sat watching some boring show. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready&rdquo; Clint slightly jumped and turned. </p><p>&ldquo;Yep&rdquo; He stood and walked around the couch. We walked to the door and were met with a cash of lightning. He chuckled and held the door open.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; He nodded and stepped out himself. As we walked I constantly looked up at the lightning and rain. Clint opened the door for me. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; I chuckled again. He got in as I shut mine. It was a dark car, but it was simple. Clint started up the car and we began our journey to town.</p><p>About 30 minutes later we arrived into town. The whole ride consisted of us talking about the mission and things that we missed out on while we were gone. Once we arrive I quickly got out before he could open my door.</p><p>&ldquo;That was my job&rdquo; Clint walked around the car with his arms crossed. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I took matters into my own hands&rdquo; He jokingly rolled his eyes and walked towards the door. Of course he held it open for me. I stuck my tongue out and he just smiled.</p><p>The bar wasn&rsquo;t too packed, just a few men and women conversing. Clint motioned for me to sit next to him at the bar. </p><p>&ldquo;Two beers&rdquo; He flagged down the bartender and she took notice. She passed us the drinks and leaned against the table.</p><p>&ldquo;If.I&rsquo;m not mistaken, you must be Hawkeye&rdquo; She smiled a white grin and I sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am&rdquo; Clint took a swig if his beer and chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to thank you for saving New York.
