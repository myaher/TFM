Under BTS chronicle there are 5 boxes that show the all the concepts they did from the school trilogy to Love Yourself.

You take a sip of your coffee, cheeks growing red even before you could speak. </p><p>\u201cI was this close to kissing Jeonguk when you called me yesterday, you better have a good reason or I\u2019m disowning you,\u201d Taehyung continues talking as you took another sip of your coffee. Jimin is sitting next to him and you see his smirk before he starts signing. <b><i>You don\u2019t even own her, loser.</i></b></p><p>\u201cHyung! Why are you always on her side? I thought I have enough betrayal from my own sibling,\u201d Jimin\u2019s face forms another victory smile before you heard whispering laughter from the older. You love it, the voice Jimin produces when he laughs, it sounds almost magical.</p><p>Jimin is Taehyung\u2019s brother. He has problem with his hearing. While not being totally deaf, both of them have decided to communicate with sign language. When you first met Jimin, Taehyung had told you that he is special and that you might need more time to understand him. Turns out Jimin is the nicest person you have ever met.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Jimin tell you?\u201d you asked, looking at Taehyung. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, but you have not, I repeat, have not answered my question yet and you wanted to know what\u2019s the topic of our conversation? My brother and I, when it is obviously, you?\u201d Taehyung is defeated. You see Jimin writes something down frantically on his notebook he conveniently placed on the table before.</p><p><b>I told him he does not even own you in the first place, how can he disown you then. </b></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but laughed at Taehyung. He pouted as he quickly signed back to Jimin, sometimes you really want to know what they are talking about, you want to be included in their conversations somehow. The brothers continue to <i>talk</i>to each other. The speed of their signing looks like they are ready and about to fight each other. You chuckle at how loud they are even though there is barely any sound in the room. </p><p>You notice how Jimin stops signing and scribbles down something on the notebook. One second later, holding it up and let you read them. </p><p><b>So, what with this guy you met the other day? He seems interesting.</b></p><p>You took a deep breath before speaking slowly, but not so painfully slow. Jimin could read lips well, he could sometimes get some parts of your conversation with Taehyung without his little brother signing everything for him.</p><p>\u201cI only know his name. Yoongi. He came to the library yesterday, obviously when you are not around, Tae,\u201d you look at Jimin and he nods his head, telling you that he gets what you are talking about. </p><p>\u201cAnd why do you suddenly ask about sign language? I thought you have given up on it when you left the class last year, barely remembering how to sign your own name.\u201d Taehyung replied you in a faster pace while signing at the same time. </p><p>\u201cHe is deaf,\u201d you said shortly. Jimin quickly writes another short sentence on his notebook, while Taehyung is still trying to recover from the chocking and coughing he experienced when you have told the two brothers that Yoongi is deaf. </p><p><b>You like him? Already?</b></p><p>Now you are the one who almost choke yourself with your coffee. \u201cNo! I barely know him,\u201d you replied to Jimin, sounding almost like a whisper. </p><p>\u201cSo, why the dedication to learn the sign language though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he will come visit again next weekend, and I want to talk to him, you know without his interpreter,\u201d you replied to Taehyung\u2019s question. </p><p>\u201cSo, he does have an interpreter.\u201d You nodded. \u201cBut Tae, I really wanted to talk to him personally. At least remind me how to sign \u2018How are you,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 or \u2018What do you do\u2019,\u201d if Jimin could hear, he will probably laugh at you like how Taehyung is laughing at your desperate tones now. Jimin taps his younger brother\u2019s shoulder lightly and starts signing. It takes them awhile, probably because Jimin could not catch up with your speed anymore. </p><p>\u201cSo, hyung, what do you think?\u201d Taehyung said verbally, while giving a wink to Jimin. </p><p><b>We will help you, Y/n, </b>it reads and you swear to God you love this two men more than anyone else. </p><p>It takes you such a long time just to remember how to sign the alphabets. It takes you even longer time to sign specific words, phrases or sentences. But whenever you are ready to give up, Yoongi\u2019s crescent eyes come into your mind and you are once again ready to learn more. You actually thank yourself for taking the Sign Language class a year ago because some of them is still actually there in your memories. </p><p>It is Saturday again and it is raining. The library is always less crowded on rainy days, probably because it is such a good day to spend in bed. Whenever the door is opened, you immediately look up, only to be greeted by unfamiliar faces over and over again. </p><p>\u201cStop looking at the door,\u201d Taehyung said, eyes focused on his phone screen. </p><p>\u201cI think he will not be here today, it\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generalization over there, young lady.\u201d A girl approaches your counter and hands you several books. You quickly scan all of them and give them back to her, reminding her she needs to return it in one month time. It was already three in the afternoon and nothing has happened. <i>What might even happen, Y/n?</i></p><p>\u201cJeonguk asks me to go out with him tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Taehyung shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhere to? I thought you almost kissed him the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I <i>almost </i>kissed him, guess why I didn\u2019t,\u201d he grinned sarcastically, showing his annoyance. You actually felt guilty about that. \u201cI am so sorry, Tae. How about lamb skewer? Bills on me, next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make sure I am free that day, you know what, yes I am free!\u201d his ultimate boxy smile showing on his perfectly shaped face. <i>This son of a bitch, if I didn\u2019t love you I would have disown you first.</i></p><p>\u201cAnd I think someone you are looking for from just now is here,\u201d his chin moving slightly, pointing at the door of the library. You ran to greet him, leaving Taehyung alone on the check-out counter. </p><p>Yoongi is smiling when you run to him. His black hair is combed and styled properly compared to the first time you meet him. They do not cover his eyes anymore, making his cat eyes more prominent while his pale skin compliments. God, he is the epitome of beautiful.</p><p><b><i>Hello, y/n. </i></b>Yoongi starts signing. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Yoongi. </i></b>You sign back to him as precisely as you could. \u201cAnd Hello, Namjoon.\u201d Namjoon smiles to you before whispering a small <i>hello. </i>Yoongi signs out something to Namjoon, very fast and short but you know what it is. When Namjoon was about to tell you what Yoongi wants to say, you sign back the reply him instead. </p><p><b><i>I am fine, Yoongi. How are you? </i></b>Yoongi\u2019s eyes sparkle and by now you are very familiar with that crescent shape of his eyes if he smiles. </p><p><b><i>I\u2019m good! You, </i></b>he hesitates <b><i>Do you learn the sign language? </i></b>He signs, waiting for me to sign back with enthusiasm, and when I sign out a <b><i>Yes</i></b>, Yoongi\u2019s smile grows even wider exposing his gum. Your heart skips a bit when he signs out a <b><i>Thank you</i></b>. <i>Why is he thanking me?</i></p><p>Yoongi pulls the fabric on Namjoon shoulder, trying to shift his attention from his cellphone screen to him. The taller one turns his head, <b><i>what?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Joonie, can we spend some times with y/n after her shift ends today?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Why don\u2019t you ask her yourself, hyung?</i></b></p><p>Yoongi stops signing. He forgets that you are standing in front of him, probably seeing everything. To be honest, you do not understand anything other than Namjoon\u2019s first <i>What. </i>Yoongi signs quickly towards you trying to explain something, his face red with embarrassment. He probably thought you understand him. You smile to him nevertheless, not wanting him to be disappointed. Namjoon notices how confused you are and chuckles. </p><p>\u201cY/n, you don\u2019t get him, do you?\u201d Namjoon asked quietly, and you shake your head, feeling guilty of not understanding Yoongi. But you do not want Namjoon to tell Yoongi you do not understand him. So, when Yoongi stops signing because Namjoon speaks to you, you immediately sign back to him. </p><p><b><i>I am sorry, Yoongi. It is too fast and the sentences are too complex. I do not understand you. </i></b>You sign out with a sad facial expression followed by an awkward laugh, but Yoongi smiles instead before continues to sign towards Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s okay and he is grateful that you learn that much for him,\u201d you bring your eyes back to Yoongi who is just slightly taller than you. His smile doesn\u2019t fade, not even for a slight moment. </p><p>\u201cY/n, Yoongi is asking whether you want to spend some time with him after your shifts ended. It\u2019s okay if you say no, you are probably tired and it will probably be boring,\u201d Namjoon asked. You see Yoongi waiting with anticipation, and you sign out a <b><i>Yes. </i></b>What is the reason to say no, anyway?</p><p>Yoongi and Namjoon waited for you in the library. Namjoon is busy with his phone and Yoongi seemingly writing things out in a book on the table. There\u2019s a lot of thing you want to know about Yoongi. What he does for living, is he a university student, what color does he like, what he does during his free time, everything mundane. You notice that Yoongi sometimes stands up from his seat in order to talk to Namjoon. How they sign is very similar to Jimin and Taehyung. It feels very familiar. </p><p>\u201cY/n, stop smiling like that, you are scaring me,\u201d You roll your eyes but let him slides this time, and it reminds you of the very familiar feelings. </p><p>\u201cTae, you can probably talk to Yoongi, you know sign language, right? I think he will be happy to meet more people.\u201d</p><p><b><i>I will, but not now. You go and pursue him, stupid. </i></b>Taehyung starts to sign. </p><p>\u201cDid you just mock me, Kim Taehyung, or perhaps curse at me?\u201d you folded your arms. </p><p>\u201cFirst, I do not, and yes, I will talk to him but only when you understand what I signed just now.\u201d You just breaths out a small laughter. Taehyung is annoying, but he is the only person you could rely on and you believe in. He probably knows you better than you know yourself. </p><p>Your shift ended at six. The library is not closed until eight, so Namjoon decides that it is the best just to stay here for a small talk since it is also raining outside. You sit on the chair across to Yoongi\u2019s. He is so focused and do not even bother looking up when your arm accidentally pushes the table a little bit. Sitting like this, watching Yoongi doing his things passionately, while sometimes biting his lower lips when he runs out of idea, is more than enough for you to cure the tiredness. When you notice that he was not writing letters however, you turn to Namjoon to ask him question but it seems like the taller man already know what you are going to ask. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a song,\u201d he says shortly. You thought you heard it wrong when Namjoon says that. \u201cYoongi is a composer.\u201d <i>A composer</i>. When you were about to ask Namjoon another question, Yoongi gently taps you on your shoulder, an apologetic smile on his face. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Y/n. Sorry, I didn\u2019t notice you just now.</i></b></p><p>There are so many things I want to know about you, Min Yoongi. </p>",

Namjoon notices how confused you are and chuckles. </p><p>\u201cY/n, you don\u2019t get him, do you?\u201d Namjoon asked quietly, and you shake your head, feeling guilty of not understanding Yoongi. But you do not want Namjoon to tell Yoongi you do not understand him. So, when Yoongi stops signing because Namjoon speaks to you, you immediately sign back to him. </p><p><b><i>I am sorry, Yoongi. It is too fast and the sentences are too complex. I do not understand you. </i></b>You sign out with a sad facial expression followed by an awkward laugh, but Yoongi smiles instead before continues to sign towards Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s okay and he is grateful that you learn that much for him,\u201d you bring your eyes back to Yoongi who is just slightly taller than you. His smile doesn\u2019t fade, not even for a slight moment. </p><p>\u201cY/n, Yoongi is asking whether you want to spend some time with him after your shifts ended. It\u2019s okay if you say no, you are probably tired and it will probably be boring,\u201d Namjoon asked. You see Yoongi waiting with anticipation, and you sign out a <b><i>Yes. </i></b>What is the reason to say no, anyway?</p><p>Yoongi and Namjoon waited for you in the library. Namjoon is busy with his phone and Yoongi seemingly writing things out in a book on the table. There\u2019s a lot of thing you want to know about Yoongi. What he does for living, is he a university student, what color does he like, what he does during his free time, everything mundane. You notice that Yoongi sometimes stands up from his seat in order to talk to Namjoon. How they sign is very similar to Jimin and Taehyung. It feels very familiar. </p><p>\u201cY/n, stop smiling like that, you are scaring me,\u201d You roll your eyes but let him slides this time, and it reminds you of the very familiar feelings. </p><p>\u201cTae, you can probably talk to Yoongi, you know sign language, right? I think he will be happy to meet more people.\u201d</p><p><b><i>I will, but not now. You go and pursue him, stupid. </i></b>Taehyung starts to sign. </p><p>\u201cDid you just mock me, Kim Taehyung, or perhaps curse at me?\u201d you folded your arms. </p><p>\u201cFirst, I do not, and yes, I will talk to him but only when you understand what I signed just now.\u201d You just breaths out a small laughter. Taehyung is annoying, but he is the only person you could rely on and you believe in. He probably knows you better than you know yourself. </p><p>Your shift ended at six. The library is not closed until eight, so Namjoon decides that it is the best just to stay here for a small talk since it is also raining outside. You sit on the chair across to Yoongi\u2019s. He is so focused and do not even bother looking up when your arm accidentally pushes the table a little bit. Sitting like this, watching Yoongi doing his things passionately, while sometimes biting his lower lips when he runs out of idea, is more than enough for you to cure the tiredness. When you notice that he was not writing letters however, you turn to Namjoon to ask him question but it seems like the taller man already know what you are going to ask. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a song,\u201d he says shortly. You thought you heard it wrong when Namjoon says that. \u201cYoongi is a composer.\u201d <i>A composer</i>. When you were about to ask Namjoon another question, Yoongi gently taps you on your shoulder, an apologetic smile on his face. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Y/n. Sorry, I didn\u2019t notice you just now.</i></b></p><p>There are so many things I want to know about you, Min Yoongi. </p></p>",

A boy, who screamed the loudest and heard the deepest. </i></p><p><i>\u2014</i></p><p><i><b>chapter II</b></i></p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about this guy who manages to enlighten you about the importance of sign language,\u201d a deep voice echoes in the empty room, sounding more like a complaint. You take a sip of your coffee, cheeks growing red even before you could speak. </p><p>\u201cI was this close to kissing Jeonguk when you called me yesterday, you better have a good reason or I\u2019m disowning you,\u201d Taehyung continues talking as you took another sip of your coffee. Jimin is sitting next to him and you see his smirk before he starts signing. <b><i>You don\u2019t even own her, loser.</i></b></p><p>\u201cHyung! Why are you always on her side? I thought I have enough betrayal from my own sibling,\u201d Jimin\u2019s face forms another victory smile before you heard whispering laughter from the older. You love it, the voice Jimin produces when he laughs, it sounds almost magical.</p><p>Jimin is Taehyung\u2019s brother. He has problem with his hearing. While not being totally deaf, both of them have decided to communicate with sign language. When you first met Jimin, Taehyung had told you that he is special and that you might need more time to understand him. Turns out Jimin is the nicest person you have ever met.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Jimin tell you?\u201d you asked, looking at Taehyung. </p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, but you have not, I repeat, have not answered my question yet and you wanted to know what\u2019s the topic of our conversation? My brother and I, when it is obviously, you?\u201d Taehyung is defeated. You see Jimin writes something down frantically on his notebook he conveniently placed on the table before.</p><p><b>I told him he does not even own you in the first place, how can he disown you then. </b></p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but laughed at Taehyung. He pouted as he quickly signed back to Jimin, sometimes you really want to know what they are talking about, you want to be included in their conversations somehow. The brothers continue to <i>talk</i>to each other. The speed of their signing looks like they are ready and about to fight each other. You chuckle at how loud they are even though there is barely any sound in the room. </p><p>You notice how Jimin stops signing and scribbles down something on the notebook. One second later, holding it up and let you read them. </p><p><b>So, what with this guy you met the other day? He seems interesting.</b></p><p>You took a deep breath before speaking slowly, but not so painfully slow. Jimin could read lips well, he could sometimes get some parts of your conversation with Taehyung without his little brother signing everything for him.</p><p>\u201cI only know his name. Yoongi. He came to the library yesterday, obviously when you are not around, Tae,\u201d you look at Jimin and he nods his head, telling you that he gets what you are talking about. </p><p>\u201cAnd why do you suddenly ask about sign language? I thought you have given up on it when you left the class last year, barely remembering how to sign your own name.\u201d Taehyung replied you in a faster pace while signing at the same time. </p><p>\u201cHe is deaf,\u201d you said shortly. Jimin quickly writes another short sentence on his notebook, while Taehyung is still trying to recover from the chocking and coughing he experienced when you have told the two brothers that Yoongi is deaf. </p><p><b>You like him? Already?</b></p><p>Now you are the one who almost choke yourself with your coffee. \u201cNo! I barely know him,\u201d you replied to Jimin, sounding almost like a whisper. </p><p>\u201cSo, why the dedication to learn the sign language though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he will come visit again next weekend, and I want to talk to him, you know without his interpreter,\u201d you replied to Taehyung\u2019s question. </p><p>\u201cSo, he does have an interpreter.\u201d You nodded. \u201cBut Tae, I really wanted to talk to him personally. At least remind me how to sign \u2018How are you,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 or \u2018What do you do\u2019,\u201d if Jimin could hear, he will probably laugh at you like how Taehyung is laughing at your desperate tones now. Jimin taps his younger brother\u2019s shoulder lightly and starts signing. It takes them awhile, probably because Jimin could not catch up with your speed anymore. </p><p>\u201cSo, hyung, what do you think?\u201d Taehyung said verbally, while giving a wink to Jimin. </p><p><b>We will help you, Y/n, </b>it reads and you swear to God you love this two men more than anyone else. </p><p>It takes you such a long time just to remember how to sign the alphabets. It takes you even longer time to sign specific words, phrases or sentences. But whenever you are ready to give up, Yoongi\u2019s crescent eyes come into your mind and you are once again ready to learn more. You actually thank yourself for taking the Sign Language class a year ago because some of them is still actually there in your memories. </p><p>It is Saturday again and it is raining. The library is always less crowded on rainy days, probably because it is such a good day to spend in bed. Whenever the door is opened, you immediately look up, only to be greeted by unfamiliar faces over and over again. </p><p>\u201cStop looking at the door,\u201d Taehyung said, eyes focused on his phone screen. </p><p>\u201cI think he will not be here today, it\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s generalization over there, young lady.\u201d A girl approaches your counter and hands you several books. You quickly scan all of them and give them back to her, reminding her she needs to return it in one month time. It was already three in the afternoon and nothing has happened. <i>What might even happen, Y/n?</i></p><p>\u201cJeonguk asks me to go out with him tomorrow.\u201d </p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d Taehyung shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhere to? I thought you almost kissed him the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I <i>almost </i>kissed him, guess why I didn\u2019t,\u201d he grinned sarcastically, showing his annoyance. You actually felt guilty about that. \u201cI am so sorry, Tae. How about lamb skewer? Bills on me, next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make sure I am free that day, you know what, yes I am free!\u201d his ultimate boxy smile showing on his perfectly shaped face. <i>This son of a bitch, if I didn\u2019t love you I would have disown you first.</i></p><p>\u201cAnd I think someone you are looking for from just now is here,\u201d his chin moving slightly, pointing at the door of the library. You ran to greet him, leaving Taehyung alone on the check-out counter. </p><p>Yoongi is smiling when you run to him. His black hair is combed and styled properly compared to the first time you meet him. They do not cover his eyes anymore, making his cat eyes more prominent while his pale skin compliments. God, he is the epitome of beautiful.</p><p><b><i>Hello, y/n. </i></b>Yoongi starts signing. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Yoongi. </i></b>You sign back to him as precisely as you could. \u201cAnd Hello, Namjoon.\u201d Namjoon smiles to you before whispering a small <i>hello. </i>Yoongi signs out something to Namjoon, very fast and short but you know what it is. When Namjoon was about to tell you what Yoongi wants to say, you sign back the reply him instead. </p><p><b><i>I am fine, Yoongi. How are you? </i></b>Yoongi\u2019s eyes sparkle and by now you are very familiar with that crescent shape of his eyes if he smiles. </p><p><b><i>I\u2019m good! You, </i></b>he hesitates <b><i>Do you learn the sign language? </i></b>He signs, waiting for me to sign back with enthusiasm, and when I sign out a <b><i>Yes</i></b>, Yoongi\u2019s smile grows even wider exposing his gum. Your heart skips a bit when he signs out a <b><i>Thank you</i></b>. <i>Why is he thanking me?</i></p><p>Yoongi pulls the fabric on Namjoon shoulder, trying to shift his attention from his cellphone screen to him. The taller one turns his head, <b><i>what?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Joonie, can we spend some times with y/n after her shift ends today?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Why don\u2019t you ask her yourself, hyung?</i></b></p><p>Yoongi stops signing. He forgets that you are standing in front of him, probably seeing everything. To be honest, you do not understand anything other than Namjoon\u2019s first <i>What. </i>Yoongi signs quickly towards you trying to explain something, his face red with embarrassment. He probably thought you understand him. You smile to him nevertheless, not wanting him to be disappointed.

I thought you almost kissed him the other day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I <i>almost </i>kissed him, guess why I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he grinned sarcastically, showing his annoyance. You actually felt guilty about that. &ldquo;I am so sorry, Tae. How about lamb skewer? Bills on me, next weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will make sure I am free that day, you know what, yes I am free!&rdquo; his ultimate boxy smile showing on his perfectly shaped face. <i>This son of a bitch, if I didn&rsquo;t love you I would have disown you first.</i></p><p>&ldquo;And I think someone you are looking for from just now is here,&rdquo; his chin moving slightly, pointing at the door of the library. You ran to greet him, leaving Taehyung alone on the check-out counter. </p><p>Yoongi is smiling when you run to him. His black hair is combed and styled properly compared to the first time you meet him. They do not cover his eyes anymore, making his cat eyes more prominent while his pale skin compliments. God, he is the epitome of beautiful.</p><p><b><i>Hello, y/n. </i></b>Yoongi starts signing. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Yoongi. </i></b>You sign back to him as precisely as you could. &ldquo;And Hello, Namjoon.&rdquo; Namjoon smiles to you before whispering a small <i>hello. </i>Yoongi signs out something to Namjoon, very fast and short but you know what it is. When Namjoon was about to tell you what Yoongi wants to say, you sign back the reply him instead. </p><p><b><i>I am fine, Yoongi. How are you? </i></b>Yoongi&rsquo;s eyes sparkle and by now you are very familiar with that crescent shape of his eyes if he smiles. </p><p><b><i>I&rsquo;m good! You, </i></b>he hesitates <b><i>Do you learn the sign language? </i></b>He signs, waiting for me to sign back with enthusiasm, and when I sign out a <b><i>Yes</i></b>, Yoongi&rsquo;s smile grows even wider exposing his gum. Your heart skips a bit when he signs out a <b><i>Thank you</i></b>. <i>Why is he thanking me?</i></p><p>Yoongi pulls the fabric on Namjoon shoulder, trying to shift his attention from his cellphone screen to him. The taller one turns his head, <b><i>what?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Joonie, can we spend some times with y/n after her shift ends today?</i></b></p><p><b><i>Why don&rsquo;t you ask her yourself, hyung?</i></b></p><p>Yoongi stops signing. He forgets that you are standing in front of him, probably seeing everything. To be honest, you do not understand anything other than Namjoon&rsquo;s first <i>What. </i>Yoongi signs quickly towards you trying to explain something, his face red with embarrassment. He probably thought you understand him. You smile to him nevertheless, not wanting him to be disappointed. Namjoon notices how confused you are and chuckles. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, you don&rsquo;t get him, do you?&rdquo; Namjoon asked quietly, and you shake your head, feeling guilty of not understanding Yoongi. But you do not want Namjoon to tell Yoongi you do not understand him. So, when Yoongi stops signing because Namjoon speaks to you, you immediately sign back to him. </p><p><b><i>I am sorry, Yoongi. It is too fast and the sentences are too complex. I do not understand you. </i></b>You sign out with a sad facial expression followed by an awkward laugh, but Yoongi smiles instead before continues to sign towards Namjoon. </p><p>&ldquo;He said it&rsquo;s okay and he is grateful that you learn that much for him,&rdquo; you bring your eyes back to Yoongi who is just slightly taller than you. His smile doesn&rsquo;t fade, not even for a slight moment. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, Yoongi is asking whether you want to spend some time with him after your shifts ended. It&rsquo;s okay if you say no, you are probably tired and it will probably be boring,&rdquo; Namjoon asked. You see Yoongi waiting with anticipation, and you sign out a <b><i>Yes. </i></b>What is the reason to say no, anyway?</p><p>Yoongi and Namjoon waited for you in the library. Namjoon is busy with his phone and Yoongi seemingly writing things out in a book on the table. There&rsquo;s a lot of thing you want to know about Yoongi. What he does for living, is he a university student, what color does he like, what he does during his free time, everything mundane. You notice that Yoongi sometimes stands up from his seat in order to talk to Namjoon. How they sign is very similar to Jimin and Taehyung. It feels very familiar. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, stop smiling like that, you are scaring me,&rdquo; You roll your eyes but let him slides this time, and it reminds you of the very familiar feelings. </p><p>&ldquo;Tae, you can probably talk to Yoongi, you know sign language, right? I think he will be happy to meet more people.&rdquo;</p><p><b><i>I will, but not now. You go and pursue him, stupid. </i></b>Taehyung starts to sign. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you just mock me, Kim Taehyung, or perhaps curse at me?&rdquo; you folded your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;First, I do not, and yes, I will talk to him but only when you understand what I signed just now.&rdquo; You just breaths out a small laughter. Taehyung is annoying, but he is the only person you could rely on and you believe in. He probably knows you better than you know yourself. </p><p>Your shift ended at six. The library is not closed until eight, so Namjoon decides that it is the best just to stay here for a small talk since it is also raining outside. You sit on the chair across to Yoongi&rsquo;s. He is so focused and do not even bother looking up when your arm accidentally pushes the table a little bit. Sitting like this, watching Yoongi doing his things passionately, while sometimes biting his lower lips when he runs out of idea, is more than enough for you to cure the tiredness. When you notice that he was not writing letters however, you turn to Namjoon to ask him question but it seems like the taller man already know what you are going to ask. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a song,&rdquo; he says shortly. You thought you heard it wrong when Namjoon says that. &ldquo;Yoongi is a composer.&rdquo; <i>A composer</i>. When you were about to ask Namjoon another question, Yoongi gently taps you on your shoulder, an apologetic smile on his face. </p><p><b><i>Hello, Y/n. Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t notice you just now.</i></b></p><p>There are so many things I want to know about you, Min Yoongi. </p></p>",
