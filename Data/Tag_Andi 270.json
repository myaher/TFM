This part deals with that angsty exchange of looks we saw in the cafeteria :-))) </p><p>**********</p><p>This felt like the longest day ever. Cyrus\u2019 eyes were fixed on the clock that was mounted above the whiteboard. 11:25 AM. Ugh, more than a half an hour left until he was able to talk to TJ. Cyrus had texted TJ multiple times that morning, but there was no reply. This only made Cyrus even more anxious about the whole situation. </p><p>\u201cGoodman.\u201d </p><p>It actually kind of hurt him that TJ was so hesitant to talk to him. He thought they\u2019ve gotten to the point in their friendship where they could pretty much talk about anything. But apparently not, he guessed? </p><p>\u201cGOODMAN!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus was brought back to reality by the booming sound of his Literature teacher\u2019s voice. Cyrus heard soft giggles around him and realised he\u2019d been spacing out. </p><p>\u201cDo me a favour, quit daydreaming and read paragraph 4, will you?\u201d he crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. Cyrus blinked a couple times, tried to find said paragraph, and did as he was told. </p><p>The lunch bell rang after what felt like an eternity, and Cyrus rushed out of the classroom to his locker. He stuffed books in, pulled other books out and practically ran to the cafeteria. He stood and scanned the entire cafeteria until his eyes stopped at a bright aquamarine shirt. TJ was sitting at a table by himself, and had his head down. Cyrus watched him with a pained expression for a few seconds, until TJ looked up and made eye contact. TJ\u2019s breath hitched when he saw Cyrus approaching his table. He looked back down when Cyrus took a seat. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus said quietly. </p><p>\u201cHey&hellip;\u201d TJ responded solemnly. </p><p>There was a good minute or so of silence, until TJ finally spoke up. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know Caleb?\u201d TJ didn\u2019t look up. </p><p>\u201cHe was in my History class last year. He was the only person I really talked to in that class,\u201d Cyrus explained, watching TJ carefully. TJ hummed in response. He was eventually going to come out to Cyrus, but he didn\u2019t want it to be like this. He wanted to come out to him when he was completely ready, but Caleb came along and ruined everything. TJ sighed and decided there was nothing that could be done about it, except move forward. TJ looked up at Cyrus and shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you know now. I\u2019m gay, and Caleb and I used to date,\u201d TJ started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he put you in that awkward situation, with him thinking that you were my \u2018new boyfriend\u2019 and whatever. I mean, I get it if you might not wanna hang out with me anymore&hellip;I know-\u201c </p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus interrupted him. \u201cFirst of all, why would I want to stop hanging out with you? You\u2019re one of my best friends.\u201d Cyrus got up from the opposite side of the table and sat beside his taller friend. </p><p>\u201cAnd second of all,\u201d Cyrus softly added, \u201cI\u2019m gay, too.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s mouth dropped open, but he wasn\u2019t able to get any words out. Cyrus put his hand on TJ\u2019s shoulder and smiled. The basketball player\u2019s open mouth transformed into a sweet smile and he almost looked like he was about to cry. </p><p>\u201cSo, tell me. What did Caleb even mean when he said I\u2019d be a \u2018better boyfriend than he was\u2019?\u201d Cyrus lifted one leg over the bench and turned to face TJ more. </p><p>\u201cCaleb was a straight up asshole. We only dated for like two months, and it was great during the first month, but out of nowhere he just started acting like a completely different person,\u201d TJ began his rant. </p><p>\u201cWait, before you tell me why he was an asshole, tell me about the great first month,\u201d Cyrus rested his elbow on the table and smiled. TJ slightly blushed. He definitely wasn\u2019t expecting to talk about his love life with his crush. That just wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>\u201cW-well, he was always really nice to me, and even though we kept everything lowkey, he still took me out to some really nice places. He was really into astronomy. I remember one time we went to a planetarium together and he would tell me about all the different planets and constellations. I remember going to his grandmother\u2019s house in the countryside and just lying in the grass with him at night, and watching the stars. Wow, sorry this is so gross, hahaha,\u201d TJ realised how much he was rambling. Cyrus had the cutest smile on his face and said, \u201cNo, keep going. That sounds amazing.\u201d TJ blushed again and softly chuckled. </p><p>\u201cWell it was amazing, not gonna lie. But after that first month, he stopped taking me out. He kinda took really long to reply to my messages, and he always made excuses when I tried to take him out,\u201d TJ\u2019s eyes were fixed on the ant that was crawling across the table. \u201cI remember trying to check his Instagram once, but I found out that he blocked me. I was so confused. I stopped him in the hallway one day to ask him what was going on. Then, another guy walked up to us and kissed him on the cheek. Turned out that he was cheating on me and just decided to find another guy without even having the decency to break up with me first,\u201d TJ\u2019s heart started to beat faster as the feelings of anger and humiliation were beginning to seep in. </p><p>\u201cWhat??? That\u2019s terrible&hellip;I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you,\u201d Cyrus placed his hand on TJ\u2019s leg in comfort. TJ turned his head to look at Cyrus and smiled pitifully. </p><p>\u201cYeah&hellip;that\u2019s pretty much the reason why I turned into \u2018scary-basketball-guy,\u2019\u201d TJ laughed. \u201cI was so deeply hurt that I felt as if I needed to build walls around me so it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I turned into this tough mean guy who everyone was scared of, and while that had its advantages, I still felt really lonely,\u201d TJ sighed, \u201cUntil I met you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what&hellip;?\u201d Cyrus stared at TJ with a surprised look. TJ realised what he got himself into. He was about to confess. Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, ever since we became friends, I felt those walls slowly breaking down. I felt that I could be more open around you. I wanted to be around you more and more. And then I realised,\u201d TJ gulped, \u201cthat I liked you&hellip;more than a friend.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus took a couple seconds to register this information, and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cWait&hellip;you&hellip;like me?\u201d Cyrus couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d TJ glanced at Cyrus and could feel the heat in his face. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy&hellip;I never thought you\u2019d actually like me back,\u201d Cyrus said sheepishly. </p><p>\u201cLike you&hellip;back??\u201d TJ slowly turned around in his seat to face Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus softly laughed and took one of TJ\u2019s hands in his. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cyrus looked TJ in the eye, \u201cand I\u2019d definitely try to be a boyfriend who\u2019s a thousand times better than that Caleb&hellip;Well, o-only if you want, of course.\u201d </p><p>TJ felt the anger from talking about Caleb blossom into the happiest and warmest feeling he\u2019s felt in a while. TJ smiled widely and held Cyrus\u2019 hand with both of his. </p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d </p><p>The bell signaling the end of lunch rang, and the two boys realised they didn\u2019t even get anything to eat. They laughed, got up from the table and made their way to a vending machine, hand in hand. </p>",

I\u2019m gay, and Caleb and I used to date,\u201d TJ started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he put you in that awkward situation, with him thinking that you were my \u2018new boyfriend\u2019 and whatever. I mean, I get it if you might not wanna hang out with me anymore\u2026I know-\u201c </p><p>\u201cTJ,\u201d Cyrus interrupted him. \u201cFirst of all, why would I want to stop hanging out with you? You\u2019re one of my best friends.\u201d Cyrus got up from the opposite side of the table and sat beside his taller friend. </p><p>\u201cAnd second of all,\u201d Cyrus softly added, \u201cI\u2019m gay, too.\u201d </p><p>TJ\u2019s mouth dropped open, but he wasn\u2019t able to get any words out. Cyrus put his hand on TJ\u2019s shoulder and smiled. The basketball player\u2019s open mouth transformed into a sweet smile and he almost looked like he was about to cry. </p><p>\u201cSo, tell me. What did Caleb even mean when he said I\u2019d be a \u2018better boyfriend than he was\u2019?\u201d Cyrus lifted one leg over the bench and turned to face TJ more. </p><p>\u201cCaleb was a straight up asshole. We only dated for like two months, and it was great during the first month, but out of nowhere he just started acting like a completely different person,\u201d TJ began his rant. </p><p>\u201cWait, before you tell me why he was an asshole, tell me about the great first month,\u201d Cyrus rested his elbow on the table and smiled. TJ slightly blushed. He definitely wasn\u2019t expecting to talk about his love life with his crush. That just wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><p>\u201cW-well, he was always really nice to me, and even though we kept everything lowkey, he still took me out to some really nice places. He was really into astronomy. I remember one time we went to a planetarium together and he would tell me about all the different planets and constellations. I remember going to his grandmother\u2019s house in the countryside and just lying in the grass with him at night, and watching the stars. Wow, sorry this is so gross, hahaha,\u201d TJ realised how much he was rambling. Cyrus had the cutest smile on his face and said, \u201cNo, keep going. That sounds amazing.\u201d TJ blushed again and softly chuckled. </p><p>\u201cWell it was amazing, not gonna lie. But after that first month, he stopped taking me out. He kinda took really long to reply to my messages, and he always made excuses when I tried to take him out,\u201d TJ\u2019s eyes were fixed on the ant that was crawling across the table. \u201cI remember trying to check his Instagram once, but I found out that he blocked me. I was so confused. I stopped him in the hallway one day to ask him what was going on. Then, another guy walked up to us and kissed him on the cheek. Turned out that he was cheating on me and just decided to find another guy without even having the decency to break up with me first,\u201d TJ\u2019s heart started to beat faster as the feelings of anger and humiliation were beginning to seep in. </p><p>\u201cWhat??? That\u2019s terrible\u2026I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you,\u201d Cyrus placed his hand on TJ\u2019s leg in comfort. TJ turned his head to look at Cyrus and smiled pitifully. </p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026that\u2019s pretty much the reason why I turned into \u2018scary-basketball-guy,\u2019\u201d TJ laughed. \u201cI was so deeply hurt that I felt as if I needed to build walls around me so it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I turned into this tough mean guy who everyone was scared of, and while that had its advantages, I still felt really lonely,\u201d TJ sighed, \u201cUntil I met you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2026?\u201d Cyrus stared at TJ with a surprised look. TJ realised what he got himself into. He was about to confess. Well, here goes nothing.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, ever since we became friends, I felt those walls slowly breaking down. I felt that I could be more open around you. I wanted to be around you more and more. And then I realised,\u201d TJ gulped, \u201cthat I liked you\u2026more than a friend.\u201d </p><p>Cyrus took a couple seconds to register this information, and shook his head. </p><p>\u201cWait\u2026you\u2026like me?\u201d Cyrus couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d TJ glanced at Cyrus and could feel the heat in his face. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy\u2026I never thought you\u2019d actually like me back,\u201d Cyrus said sheepishly. </p><p>\u201cLike you\u2026back??\u201d TJ slowly turned around in his seat to face Cyrus. </p><p>Cyrus softly laughed and took one of TJ\u2019s hands in his. </p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cyrus looked TJ in the eye, \u201cand I\u2019d definitely try to be a boyfriend who\u2019s a thousand times better than that Caleb\u2026Well, o-only if you want, of course.\u201d </p><p>TJ felt the anger from talking about Caleb blossom into the happiest and warmest feeling he\u2019s felt in a while. TJ smiled widely and held Cyrus\u2019 hand with both of his. </p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d </p><p>The bell signaling the end of lunch rang, and the two boys realised they didn\u2019t even get anything to eat. They laughed, got up from the table and made their way to a vending machine, hand in hand. </p></p>",

This part deals with that angsty exchange of looks we saw in the cafeteria :-))) </p><p>**********</p><p>This felt like the longest day ever. Cyrus\u2019 eyes were fixed on the clock that was mounted above the whiteboard. 11:25 AM. Ugh, more than a half an hour left until he was able to talk to TJ. Cyrus had texted TJ multiple times that morning, but there was no reply. This only made Cyrus even more anxious about the whole situation. </p><p>\u201cGoodman.\u201d </p><p>It actually kind of hurt him that TJ was so hesitant to talk to him. He thought they\u2019ve gotten to the point in their friendship where they could pretty much talk about anything. But apparently not, he guessed? </p><p>\u201cGOODMAN!\u201d </p><p>Cyrus was brought back to reality by the booming sound of his Literature teacher\u2019s voice. Cyrus heard soft giggles around him and realised he\u2019d been spacing out. </p><p>\u201cDo me a favour, quit daydreaming and read paragraph 4, will you?\u201d he crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. Cyrus blinked a couple times, tried to find said paragraph, and did as he was told. </p><p>The lunch bell rang after what felt like an eternity, and Cyrus rushed out of the classroom to his locker. He stuffed books in, pulled other books out and practically ran to the cafeteria. He stood and scanned the entire cafeteria until his eyes stopped at a bright aquamarine shirt. TJ was sitting at a table by himself, and had his head down. Cyrus watched him with a pained expression for a few seconds, until TJ looked up and made eye contact. TJ\u2019s breath hitched when he saw Cyrus approaching his table. He looked back down when Cyrus took a seat. </p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cyrus said quietly. </p><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d TJ responded solemnly. </p><p>There was a good minute or so of silence, until TJ finally spoke up. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know Caleb?\u201d TJ didn\u2019t look up. </p><p>\u201cHe was in my History class last year. He was the only person I really talked to in that class,\u201d Cyrus explained, watching TJ carefully. TJ hummed in response. He was eventually going to come out to Cyrus, but he didn\u2019t want it to be like this. He wanted to come out to him when he was completely ready, but Caleb came along and ruined everything. TJ sighed and decided there was nothing that could be done about it, except move forward. TJ looked up at Cyrus and shrugged. </p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you know now.
