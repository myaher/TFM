I know fuck all about agriculture but I <i>do</i> have chickens so here\u2019s the weirdly angsty drabble wherein Nott, Caleb and Yeza talk about countryside life and owning hens with some relatively tragic subtext.</p><p>Set in, like, episode 58??</p><p>The biting chill was perhaps, of everything they\u2019d encountered in Xhorhas, the one thing that Nott found the most unfamiliar, the most unsettling. Maybe it was odd, that it was the wind and the spitting rain in the air that felt alien to her here, rather than the great stone giants that traipsed through the streets; the strange voices and languages, guttural, that surrounded them; the sky that stayed dark and star-dappled no matter how many times Caleb muttered that it was noon; the fact that her hair was tied back and her shoulders exposed, sallow and green but somehow inconspicuous, the hostile looks and curious glances passing over her and onto her friends. (Maybe she liked that. Just a bit, just maybe.)</p><p>But when she closed her eyes and gripped Yeza\u2019s hand, the chill was the thing that didn\u2019t go away. She had felt it too, back when they first travelled North all those months ago, the tangible sting that was <i>knowing</i>, more than just knowing, that she was far, far from home. Felderwin was warm, tucked safely away with only one hard, cold winter she could call to memory.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>Glancing over at her husband, she saw he was gazing off at something in the distance, distracted. She watched him as they walked, his head twisting this way and that, with his mouth slightly open, as if slowly processing each and every little detail.</p><p>They came up to the door of the inn, and his attention refocused as she gave his arm a fond tug. \u201cWhat were you so distracted by, hun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d He replied, looking at her with a puzzled expression as they entered into the warm interior, shuffling forward and seating themselves at an empty table.</p><p>The rest immediately broke out into discussion about something or other, while she turned to Yeza again and said \u201cYou kept looking around, like you were a house cat seeing the outside world for the first time or something. It was cute.\u201d</p><p>She noticed Caleb\u2019s head perk up out of the corner of her eye as soon as she said the word \u2018cat\u2019 (of course), and Yeza flushed slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, it just isn\u2019t very often I leave Felderwin, let alone visit a place like this, or, well, it isn\u2019t really visiting. I mean, I\u2019m scared of literally everyone here but I guess it\u2019s also overwhelming\u2026 in a good way?\u201d he looked at her and smiled, \u201cthough you\u2019re probably more used to it than I am, after all your travels.\u201d</p><p>Before Nott could reply, Caleb chimed in. smiling, \u201cI understand how you feel. I\u2019m from a small town also, but I remember -\u201d he faltered slightly, as if troubled by a memory he couldn\u2019t quite recall, \u201cI remember what it was like going to Rexxentrum for the first time. You described the feeling well, friend. Overwhelming in a good way.\u201d</p><p>Yeza smiled back, albeit awkwardly. Every one of their interactions were equal parts painful and endearing to watch; she should have expected this.</p><p>\u201cWhy are all my favourite people total nerds?\u201d She muttered quietly, before Beau shifted to join the conversation which she had apparently been listening into this entire time.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you and No- uh, Veth, are sort of the farming kids of the group, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She asked, leaning on the table with a pint in hand and gesturing between the two.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s meant to be an insult,\u201d Nott replied drily, but Caleb just looked thoughtful for a second then turned to her.</p><p>\u201cI suppose she\u2019s right. Blumenthal wasn\u2019t so different to Felderwin, though I didn\u2019t come from a farming family.\u201d</p><p>Nott groaned loudly. \u201c<i>I</i> did. It was the <i>worst</i>. Early mornings and the constant smell of pig shit. I thought I\u2019d be stuck doing it forever too - thank god I managed to bag someone clever.\u201d She threw a joking wink in Yeza\u2019s direction and he sniggered quietly. Caleb looked as if he was going to say something before she continued, \u201cI mean, <i>most</i> of it sucked. I remember enjoying taking care of the chickens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we kept a few as well. They were good for eggs, but also for when we couldn\u2019t afford to buy meat.\u201d Caleb looked thoughtful, \u201cI remember my father tried to teach me to kill and pluck one once. I told him I didn\u2019t want to hurt B\u00f6hnchen and he got angry at me for giving them names. I was\u2026 Careful not to get attached after that.\u201d</p><p>Nott paused for a moment, concerned but unable to read Caleb\u2019s body language properly, before Yeza prodded her lightly and said, \u201cyou\u2019ve never told me about your chickens before.\u201d</p><p>She sat for a moment, all the semi-fond memories of chalky corn and feathers coming back to her. \u201cOur chickens were for eggs only, really - <i>way</i> too skinny to eat, so us kids were allowed to give them names. There was Pebbles and Sandals, those two were sisters, then Lady, Flora, Fern, and my personal favourite, Egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid <i>you</i> name that one?\u201d Beau questioned, eyebrow raised. </p><p>\u201cI was, like, six okay?\u201d Yeza giggled quietly beside her. \u201cBut I loved playing with them. Did you know they\u2019re actually really cuddly and nice to pick up? I remember they would always bend down and stay still when I went to grab them.\u201d She grimaced slightly, \u201cI thought it was because they liked me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the real reason?\u201d Beau asked. Caleb snorted very quietly,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say my big brother ruined chickens for me forever after he told me. He also told me that eggs are technically just chicken periods, so there\u2019s that too.\u201d</p><p>Beau made a sound of abject disgust and turned to Caleb. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo that\u2019s fairly accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, <i>god</i>,\u201d she turned and started to walk away, \u201cCaduceus, never make anything for us with eggs ever again, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nott laughed and called out, \u201cIf I have to bear this knowledge, so do you,\u201d before turning back to the other two. \u201cHey Yez, since we\u2019re talking about nature and shit, now seems like a good opportunity to ramble about mushrooms to Deucey over there. Catch him while you can, you know?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up at that, turning to her excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s honestly fascinating. A fungi-based magical signature, like, what even are the properties of those plants? The potential functions I mean \u2013\u201c she threw him a pointed look, \u201cyes, right, I should go over there and actually find out this stuff.\u201d He smiled sheepishly and hopped down from the table, going to join the others who had apparently migrated to the bar.</p><p>Nott turned to Caleb, who still seemed thoughtful. \u201cAre you\u2026 Okay?\u201d She questioned carefully.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ja</i>, of course. Your husband seems to be a good fellow,\u201d he replied, smiling and genuine.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she paused, \u201cit\u2019s just you don\u2019t talk about home very often.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her for a moment and replied, quieter now, \u201cno,\u201d another pause, \u201cbut it was good. I had a good home.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a minute, not awkward, just quiet, before Caleb looked up again, and fixed her with a mirthful smile, \u201cReally though, chicken periods?\u201d</p><p>She grinned widely, and fixed him with a mischievous look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started.\u201d</p><p>And thus the newly dubbed Farm Kids proceeded to ruin everyone\u2019s lives with <i>all</i> the gross animal facts.

I know fuck all about agriculture but I <i>do</i> have chickens so here\u2019s the weirdly angsty drabble wherein Nott, Caleb and Yeza talk about countryside life and owning hens with some relatively tragic subtext.</p><p>Set in, like, episode 58??</p><p>The biting chill was perhaps, of everything they\u2019d encountered in Xhorhas, the one thing that Nott found the most unfamiliar, the most unsettling. Maybe it was odd, that it was the wind and the spitting rain in the air that felt alien to her here, rather than the great stone giants that traipsed through the streets; the strange voices and languages, guttural, that surrounded them; the sky that stayed dark and star-dappled no matter how many times Caleb muttered that it was noon; the fact that her hair was tied back and her shoulders exposed, sallow and green but somehow inconspicuous, the hostile looks and curious glances passing over her and onto her friends. (Maybe she liked that. Just a bit, just maybe.)</p><p>But when she closed her eyes and gripped Yeza\u2019s hand, the chill was the thing that didn\u2019t go away. She had felt it too, back when they first travelled North all those months ago, the tangible sting that was <i>knowing</i>, more than just knowing, that she was far, far from home. Felderwin was warm, tucked safely away with only one hard, cold winter she could call to memory.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>Glancing over at her husband, she saw he was gazing off at something in the distance, distracted. She watched him as they walked, his head twisting this way and that, with his mouth slightly open, as if slowly processing each and every little detail.</p><p>They came up to the door of the inn, and his attention refocused as she gave his arm a fond tug. \u201cWhat were you so distracted by, hun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d He replied, looking at her with a puzzled expression as they entered into the warm interior, shuffling forward and seating themselves at an empty table.</p><p>The rest immediately broke out into discussion about something or other, while she turned to Yeza again and said \u201cYou kept looking around, like you were a house cat seeing the outside world for the first time or something. It was cute.\u201d</p><p>She noticed Caleb\u2019s head perk up out of the corner of her eye as soon as she said the word \u2018cat\u2019 (of course), and Yeza flushed slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, it just isn\u2019t very often I leave Felderwin, let alone visit a place like this, or, well, it isn\u2019t really visiting. I mean, I\u2019m scared of literally everyone here but I guess it\u2019s also overwhelming\u2026 in a good way?\u201d he looked at her and smiled, \u201cthough you\u2019re probably more used to it than I am, after all your travels.\u201d</p><p>Before Nott could reply, Caleb chimed in. smiling, \u201cI understand how you feel. I\u2019m from a small town also, but I remember -\u201d he faltered slightly, as if troubled by a memory he couldn\u2019t quite recall, \u201cI remember what it was like going to Rexxentrum for the first time. You described the feeling well, friend. Overwhelming in a good way.\u201d</p><p>Yeza smiled back, albeit awkwardly. Every one of their interactions were equal parts painful and endearing to watch; she should have expected this.</p><p>\u201cWhy are all my favourite people total nerds?\u201d She muttered quietly, before Beau shifted to join the conversation which she had apparently been listening into this entire time.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you and No- uh, Veth, are sort of the farming kids of the group, aren\u2019t you?\u201d She asked, leaning on the table with a pint in hand and gesturing between the two.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s meant to be an insult,\u201d Nott replied drily, but Caleb just looked thoughtful for a second then turned to her.</p><p>\u201cI suppose she\u2019s right. Blumenthal wasn\u2019t so different to Felderwin, though I didn\u2019t come from a farming family.\u201d</p><p>Nott groaned loudly. \u201c<i>I</i> did. It was the <i>worst</i>. Early mornings and the constant smell of pig shit. I thought I\u2019d be stuck doing it forever too - thank god I managed to bag someone clever.\u201d She threw a joking wink in Yeza\u2019s direction and he sniggered quietly. Caleb looked as if he was going to say something before she continued, \u201cI mean, <i>most</i> of it sucked. I remember enjoying taking care of the chickens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, we kept a few as well. They were good for eggs, but also for when we couldn\u2019t afford to buy meat.\u201d Caleb looked thoughtful, \u201cI remember my father tried to teach me to kill and pluck one once. I told him I didn\u2019t want to hurt B\u00f6hnchen and he got angry at me for giving them names. I was\u2026 Careful not to get attached after that.\u201d</p><p>Nott paused for a moment, concerned but unable to read Caleb\u2019s body language properly, before Yeza prodded her lightly and said, \u201cyou\u2019ve never told me about your chickens before.\u201d</p><p>She sat for a moment, all the semi-fond memories of chalky corn and feathers coming back to her. \u201cOur chickens were for eggs only, really - <i>way</i> too skinny to eat, so us kids were allowed to give them names. There was Pebbles and Sandals, those two were sisters, then Lady, Flora, Fern, and my personal favourite, Egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid <i>you</i> name that one?\u201d Beau questioned, eyebrow raised. </p><p>\u201cI was, like, six okay?\u201d Yeza giggled quietly beside her. \u201cBut I loved playing with them. Did you know they\u2019re actually really cuddly and nice to pick up? I remember they would always bend down and stay still when I went to grab them.\u201d She grimaced slightly, \u201cI thought it was because they liked me\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the real reason?\u201d Beau asked. Caleb snorted very quietly,</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say my big brother ruined chickens for me forever after he told me. He also told me that eggs are technically just chicken periods, so there\u2019s that too.\u201d</p><p>Beau made a sound of abject disgust and turned to Caleb. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo that\u2019s fairly accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, <i>god</i>,\u201d she turned and started to walk away, \u201cCaduceus, never make anything for us with eggs ever again, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nott laughed and called out, \u201cIf I have to bear this knowledge, so do you,\u201d before turning back to the other two. \u201cHey Yez, since we\u2019re talking about nature and shit, now seems like a good opportunity to ramble about mushrooms to Deucey over there. Catch him while you can, you know?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up at that, turning to her excitedly, \u201cIt\u2019s honestly fascinating. A fungi-based magical signature, like, what even are the properties of those plants? The potential functions I mean \u2013\u201c she threw him a pointed look, \u201cyes, right, I should go over there and actually find out this stuff.\u201d He smiled sheepishly and hopped down from the table, going to join the others who had apparently migrated to the bar.</p><p>Nott turned to Caleb, who still seemed thoughtful. \u201cAre you\u2026 Okay?\u201d She questioned carefully.</p><p>\u201c<i>Ja</i>, of course. Your husband seems to be a good fellow,\u201d he replied, smiling and genuine.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she paused, \u201cit\u2019s just you don\u2019t talk about home very often.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her for a moment and replied, quieter now, \u201cno,\u201d another pause, \u201cbut it was good. I had a good home.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a minute, not awkward, just quiet, before Caleb looked up again, and fixed her with a mirthful smile, \u201cReally though, chicken periods?\u201d</p><p>She grinned widely, and fixed him with a mischievous look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started.\u201d</p><p>And thus the newly dubbed Farm Kids proceeded to ruin everyone\u2019s lives with <i>all</i> the gross animal facts.

Is a skilled blacksmith and made her whole family\u2019s armor. Has muscles in places you don\u2019t even know existed.</p><p><b>Celia </b>is a <i>Ranger </i>and <i>Beastmaster </i>and her animal companion is a Giant Badger called Honeydew. Honeydew is mostly specialized on stealing food from Celias\u2019s siblings whenever she wants seconds. Is the second eldest and also tallest of the Clay siblings. Very chubby and soft. Has a talent for languages and driving most of her siblings crazy with her terrible singing voice.</p><p><b>Caduceus </b>is the third in line and he is, apart from his youngest sibling Corrin, the smallest of his family. Something especially Clarabelle and Celia like to remind him and Corrin of. As we all know, <i>Grave Cleric</i> of the Wildmother. <br/></p><p><b>Cormac </b>is a <i>Druid </i>in the <i>Circle of Spores</i>. Much like Caduceus he specializes in decomposition processes of bodies and he used to lead the funeral services alongside his mother before he left his home like Clarabelle and Celia before him. Is a rather timid and introverted guy, but will come out of his shell if you ask about butterflies or astronomy. <br/></p><p><b>Camille </b>stands out as the only Clay sibling <i>without a class</i>. She is as much a passionate scientist as she\u2019s a hobby historian, always reading and learning new things which sets her apart from most of her siblings, many of whom never much cared for reading. Super stubborn, but mostly a giant nerd. Picked the name Camille herself (since Cailan never much felt true to who she is) after one of her favorite historic figures. <br/></p><p><b>Clementine </b>is a <i>Cleric </i>of the Raven Queen and much like her brother she masters the <i>Grave Domain</i>. She was born deaf and uses all her spells with sign language. Is the tea expert in the family as well as a talented artist. Her sketchbooks filled with plants, animals and drawings of all her family were left behind when she followed Clarabelle to find a cure for their home. <br/></p><p><b>Corrin </b>is the baby of the family and also the shortest Clay sibling. They\u2019re a <i>Druid </i>like Cormac but they chose the <i>Circle of the Land</i> (Forest specialization). Corrin has probably climbed every living and dead tree in the near proximity of the Blooming Grove. Always wanted to leave and see the world, but was actually the third to last to actually leave it behind. Curious and caring and oh so much in love with trees and all that grows. <br/><br/></p>",
