Fourth floor, west wing corridor,\u201d</p><p>I panicked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cFuck!\u201d I audibly\nscreamed.</p><p>I began running down the hallway until I came to a room on\nthe left side of the hallway.</p><p>It looked like a hotel room with everything from a small\nkitchenette to a bed and a living area.</p><p>I ducked into the room and started to hide when I remembered\nthat I can just portal out.</p><p>I opened a portal and jumped through, landing back in my\nkitchen looking very dishevelled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWhat did you bring\nme?\u201d Axell asked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cShit!\u201d I\u2019d forgotten to get a souvenir. \u201chang\non,\u201d</p><p>I opened another portal back to that room and looked around\nfor something to nick.</p><p>Again, the voice called over the PA system.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cIntruder Alert.\nIntruder is in Captain Rogers\u2019s living quarters,\u201d</p><p><i>Fuck</i></p><p><i>Fuck fuck fuck fuck</i></p><p>I began frantically searching the room for something to\nsteal.</p><p>My gaze landed on a dark blue baseball cap on the\nkitchenette bench top.</p><p>I ran across the room and grabbed the hat.</p><p>As I opened a portal to leave once again, a large man ran into\nthe room.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHey!\u201d I shouted,\nwaving the cap in the air. \u201cSorry to bother y\u2019all. I needed this to settle a\nbet! Bye!\u201d</p><p>I was about to jump through when the man (who was not\nCaptain America) called out to me in a gruff voice.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cHold it!\u201d he\nshouted.</p><p>Some other voices overlapped his and I heard a <i>pop! </i>before I felt a sharp pinch in my\narm.</p><p>I jumped through and landed in the middle of my living room\nwith a thud.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cOw what the fuck!\u201d\nI dropped the hat and looked at the dart in my arm. \u201cGuys I think they sedated\nme!\u201d </p><p>I ripped the dart from my arm and looked up at my friends.</p><p>They ran over from the kitchen with worry in their eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cDude sit down!\u201d Lillian\nshouted, gesturing wildly at the couch behind me.</p><p>I did as she said and waited to pass out.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cguys I feel fine,\u201d\nI looked up at them. \u201cWhat if it\u2019 not a sedative dart,\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWhat else could it\nbe?\u201d Axell took it from my hands and examined it. \u201cIt\u2019s got a little red\nflashing light,\u201d</p><p>Lillian looked up from me to the dart in Axell\u2019s hands.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a tracker!\u201d\nshe shouted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cShit!\u201d the blood\ndrained from his face. \u201cWhat do we do?!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She\ncried back. \u201cuhhh\u2026. Throw it out the window!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSeriously?!\u201d he\nscreamed.</p><p>HE clamoured around for a bit before he nodded fearfully and\nopened the window he\u2019d shouted out of earlier.</p><p>With one last look back at us he readied his throwing arm.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cWait!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>I jumped up from the couch and took the dart from him,\ntaking it to the kitchen.</p><p>I placed it on the bench then opened the second drawer and\npulled out the rolling pin.</p><p>I put the dart on the cutting board, still on the bench from\nlunch earlier, and brought the rolling pin down, smashing the dart to pieces.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cjust to be sure,\u201d\nI shrugged.</p><p>I scooped up the chunks of tech and handed then back to\nAxell.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cNow throw it,\u201d I\nsaid firmly.</p><p>He nodded and drew his arm back before tossing the shards of\nthe dart as far as he could into the darkness outside.</p><p>We stood around in silence for a few seconds waiting for\nanything to happen.</p><p>Nothing did.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cDude what now?\u201d\nAxell broke the silence.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSeason 10 of Doctor\nWho was just added to Netflix,\u201d Lillian said quietly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll get the\nsnacks,\u201d I turned back to the kitchen.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d\nAxell asked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s it for\nnow,\u201d I shrugged.</p><hr>",
