        "body": "<p>There are many articles being written lately about which\ncharacter will be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end of the final season of\nGame of Thrones.</p>\n\n<p>The most common opinion\nseems to be that either Daenerys Targaryen or Jon Snow will emerge victorious\nas the ruler of Westeros. This is the most obvious outcome. Others opinions are that it will be Gendry Waters, Sansa Stark or\neven Tyrion Lannister who will rule Westeros. George RR Martin only promises that the ending will be bittersweet\nmeaning that there will be victories but no one will end up completely happy.</p><p>I think Daenerys will make\nit to the end of the story, but I think her fate is tied with her dragons\nrather than Jon or anyone else. If the dragons perish, she will die with her\nchildren. If the dragons defeat the Night King and his ice dragon and live, then she might\nbe the Queen of Westeros and rule as the Dragon Queen. I think more likely she will die a heroic death.\nIf she does have a child with Jon, this child might live to rule Westeros but\nwith someone else as a regent.</p><p>Jon Snow sitting on the Iron Throne might be a possibility. The\nWar of the Roses on which this story is based ended with Henry VII on the throne.\nHe was a distant cousin\u00a0of the Lancaster family and his ancestors were\nthe illegitimate children of Owen Tudor and Catherine, Henry V\u2019s widow. Henry VII\u2019s marriage to York heiress Elizabeth ended the war. So Jon could be the outsider who claims the seven kingdoms as\nhis own. After all, his mother was a Stark and his father was a Targaryen and the romance of his parents cast a long shadow over the story.</p><p></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 11.25pt 0in; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;\">Of course this argument\ncould be used for Gendry. After all he is the son of the late king. I don\u2019t\nthink that Gendry will end up on the Iron Throne, but I do think he will be the\nheir to the Crownlands.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 11.25pt 0in; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;\">Sam will make it to the end\nand possibly marry Gilly. Ok, that is what I dearly wish. Same deserves a win\nand I like them together. I see her as lady of\u00a0Horn Hill. He will be there\nto be to write it all down. Perhaps he will be the hand of the next king.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 11.25pt 0in; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;\">I have no guesses as to\nBran Stark\u2019s fate. I do not think that he will ever walk again nor be the Lord\nof Winterfell. It would be interesting to have a scene between him and\nJaime.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Sansa\u2019s fate is a bit if\nmystery. The way she has presented in the story as a Katherine of York figure\nwhose marriage might prove the political alliance to end the war. At the end of\nFeast of Crows she is still in the Vale and there was no horrific marriage to\nRamsey Bolton. Nevertheless, in the published chapter of Winds of Winter,\nLittlefinger is pimping her out to Harry the Heir who does not appear in the series. In the books Ramsey marries\nand mistreats a minor character named Jeyne Poole who he thinks is Arya Stark.\nOn the show Sansa has become the Lady of Winterfell and as an important heiress\nshe will marry again to form an alliance but who would she marry? The poor girl\nhas been engaged and married off twice. On possibility is Gendry, Jon is\nanother, or she might go back to her first husband Tyrion. In the original\noutline for the books, the\u00a0role of the romantic object of desire is\nactually Arya as Jon and Tyrion become rivals for her love but this role is now\ntaken by Daenerys.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t think Sansa will marry Jon, Gendry or\nTyrion. Sansa ending up in a relationship with the Hound is a possibility. This\nis hinted at in the books and this pairing has a considerable fandom. In the\nbooks Sansa and the Hound are deeply attracted to each other and he is never\nfar from Sansa\u2019s thoughts. If Sansa is a warg and Martin suggested that all the\nStark children are wargs, The Hound is the person Sansa might be able to\nconnect to. Unfortunately, the show runners have sidestepped that entire\nsubplot and I am guessing that this might not happen on the show. My best guess\nis that Sansa will stay at Winterfell and remain its lady. They might leave the\nHound with her as a protector but they won\u2019t do a romance between them. That\nsaid the Winterfell she will preside over will be in ruin.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 11.25pt 0in; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;\">It goes without saying that\nThe Hound will win Clegane Bowl. There will be riot in the streets if this does\nnot happen. But he might take some pity on his brother when he realizes that\nGregor was made into a monster by Cersei\u2019s henchman Qyburn. That would be an\ninteresting plot twist.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 11.25pt 0in; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;\">I heard about a story leak\nthat there was a scene filmed where the Hound is driving a wagon out of\nWinterfell and Sansa and Arya are with them.

George\nRR Martin\u2019s wife made him promise not to kill Arya off. I think Arya will\nremain alone and a warrior, but it might be that she has to pay for time with\nthe faceless men. She might also defeat them. In the original outline, Martin\nplanned to have Arya lose her taste for vengeance and eventually be with Jon\nwhen she realizes that he is not her brother. In my own fanfiction, I have Arya\nas the maiden aunt to Sansa and Sandor\u2019s children but that is wishful thinking on my part.</p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that Cersei\nand Jaime are doomed to die together as prophesized. Cersei is based on\nMargaret of Anjou the Lancaster Queen who after losing both her husband and son in battle, was defeated by the House of York.\nShe spent the last few years of her life living as a poor relation in the\nFrench court and died in penury. That would be my choice for Cersei but I think\nshe will die.

He will never win Daenerys\u2019\nlove nor will be reunited with Sansa. He might betray Jon over Daenerys or to be reunited with his brother. He\nmight take over his family\u2019s fortunes but I suspect he will be alone at the\nend.</p><p>The casts has hinted that\nthere will be many deaths during season eight and many battles. Martin mentioned that the story will end with a Game of Thrones version of the <i>\u201cScouring of the Shire\u201d</i> which means there will be destruction and battles. I think the\nshow will be more action driven rather than character driven as there are only\nsix episodes and there will not be time to flesh out character driven subplots. I am\nguessing that most of the minor characters are doomed.</p><p>Euron Greyjoy and Theon\nGreyjoy will most likely die as will most minor characters. They are doomed and rather expendable.

                "content": "<p>There are many articles being written lately about which\ncharacter will be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end of the final season of\nGame of Thrones.</p>\n\n<p>The most common opinion\nseems to be that either Daenerys Targaryen or Jon Snow will emerge victorious\nas the ruler of Westeros. This is the most obvious outcome. Others opinions are that it will be Gendry Waters, Sansa Stark or\neven Tyrion Lannister who will rule Westeros. George RR Martin only promises that the ending will be bittersweet\nmeaning that there will be victories but no one will end up completely happy.</p><p>I think Daenerys will make\nit to the end of the story, but I think her fate is tied with her dragons\nrather than Jon or anyone else. If the dragons perish, she will die with her\nchildren. If the dragons defeat the Night King and his ice dragon and live, then she might\nbe the Queen of Westeros and rule as the Dragon Queen. I think more likely she will die a heroic death.\nIf she does have a child with Jon, this child might live to rule Westeros but\nwith someone else as a regent.</p><p>Jon Snow sitting on the Iron Throne might be a possibility. The\nWar of the Roses on which this story is based ended with Henry VII on the throne.\nHe was a distant cousin&nbsp;of the Lancaster family and his ancestors were\nthe illegitimate children of Owen Tudor and Catherine, Henry V&rsquo;s widow. Henry VII&rsquo;s marriage to York heiress Elizabeth ended the war. So Jon could be the outsider who claims the seven kingdoms as\nhis own. After all, his mother was a Stark and his father was a Targaryen and the romance of his parents cast a long shadow over the story.</p>\n\n<p>Of course this argument\ncould be used for Gendry. After all he is the son of the late king. I don&rsquo;t\nthink that Gendry will end up on the Iron Throne, but I do think he will be the\nheir to the Crownlands.</p>\n\n<p>Sam will make it to the end\nand possibly marry Gilly. Ok, that is what I dearly wish. Same deserves a win\nand I like them together. I see her as lady of&nbsp;Horn Hill. He will be there\nto be to write it all down. Perhaps he will be the hand of the next king.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I have no guesses as to\nBran Stark&rsquo;s fate. I do not think that he will ever walk again nor be the Lord\nof Winterfell. It would be interesting to have a scene between him and\nJaime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sansa&rsquo;s fate is a bit if\nmystery. The way she has presented in the story as a Katherine of York figure\nwhose marriage might prove the political alliance to end the war. At the end of\nFeast of Crows she is still in the Vale and there was no horrific marriage to\nRamsey Bolton. Nevertheless, in the published chapter of Winds of Winter,\nLittlefinger is pimping her out to Harry the Heir who does not appear in the series. In the books Ramsey marries\nand mistreats a minor character named Jeyne Poole who he thinks is Arya Stark.\nOn the show Sansa has become the Lady of Winterfell and as an important heiress\nshe will marry again to form an alliance but who would she marry? The poor girl\nhas been engaged and married off twice. On possibility is Gendry, Jon is\nanother, or she might go back to her first husband Tyrion. In the original\noutline for the books, the&nbsp;role of the romantic object of desire is\nactually Arya as Jon and Tyrion become rivals for her love but this role is now\ntaken by Daenerys.&nbsp; So I don&rsquo;t think Sansa will marry Jon, Gendry or\nTyrion. Sansa ending up in a relationship with the Hound is a possibility. This\nis hinted at in the books and this pairing has a considerable fandom. In the\nbooks Sansa and the Hound are deeply attracted to each other and he is never\nfar from Sansa&rsquo;s thoughts. If Sansa is a warg and Martin suggested that all the\nStark children are wargs, The Hound is the person Sansa might be able to\nconnect to. Unfortunately, the show runners have sidestepped that entire\nsubplot and I am guessing that this might not happen on the show. My best guess\nis that Sansa will stay at Winterfell and remain its lady. They might leave the\nHound with her as a protector but they won&rsquo;t do a romance between them. That\nsaid the Winterfell she will preside over will be in ruin.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying that\nThe Hound will win Clegane Bowl. There will be riot in the streets if this does\nnot happen. But he might take some pity on his brother when he realizes that\nGregor was made into a monster by Cersei&rsquo;s henchman Qyburn. That would be an\ninteresting plot twist.</p>\n\n<p>I heard about a story leak\nthat there was a scene filmed where the Hound is driving a wagon out of\nWinterfell and Sansa and Arya are with them. Are they escaping the armies of\nthe Night King? I guess we will have to wait to find out if this report is\naccurate.&nbsp; This is a bit of wishful\nthinking bit for my fellow Sansan fans.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Arya is a question. George\nRR Martin&rsquo;s wife made him promise not to kill Arya off. I think Arya will\nremain alone and a warrior, but it might be that she has to pay for time with\nthe faceless men. She might also defeat them. In the original outline, Martin\nplanned to have Arya lose her taste for vengeance and eventually be with Jon\nwhen she realizes that he is not her brother. In my own fanfiction, I have Arya\nas the maiden aunt to Sansa and Sandor&rsquo;s children but that is wishful thinking on my part.</p>\n\n<p>I am convinced that Cersei\nand Jaime are doomed to die together as prophesized. Cersei is based on\nMargaret of Anjou the Lancaster Queen who after losing both her husband and son in battle, was defeated by the House of York.\nShe spent the last few years of her life living as a poor relation in the\nFrench court and died in penury. That would be my choice for Cersei but I think\nshe will die. Qyburn do some sorcery to make her pregnant and if this so, it\nmight be the means of her death.</p><p>I think that Tyrion will\nsurvive but I think his fate will be bittersweet. He will never win Daenerys&rsquo;\nlove nor will be reunited with Sansa. He might betray Jon over Daenerys or to be reunited with his brother. He\nmight take over his family&rsquo;s fortunes but I suspect he will be alone at the\nend.</p><p>The casts has hinted that\nthere will be many deaths during season eight and many battles.
