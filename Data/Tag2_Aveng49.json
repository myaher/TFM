As if Bucky isn&rsquo;t an adult who can function on his own with the knowing and the peace that his best friend, the person who risked everything he had to help him, had also a second chance. Bucky&rsquo;s second chance is in the now. The future. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back and live in the past. The things he did under Hydra&rsquo;s control were done in that past.</p><p>Steve? Steve didn&rsquo;t want anything else than going back to what he knew. He never stopped loving Peggy. He never stopped thinking about what his life could have been like.</p><p>I know y'all are big on interpreting Bucky as a deffenseless, fragile little thing that can only function with Steve by his side (that is until y'all gotta write him fucking your brains or Steve&rsquo;s brains out, then he is an adult). But allow me to remind you that Bucky spent the better part of two years on his own, minding his own business, until Zemo popped out of the ruins of Sokovia and decided to use him as a pawn on his vendetta against the Avengers (that should have been directed at Tony as the others were only helping him clean up his mess, but whatevs), living his life independently of Steve. After CW he stayed in Wakanda where he definitely got help (and a cute lil&rsquo; farm) while Steve was out in the world with Natasha and Sam battling villains. They are both adults that can function on their own. You might bee surprised to find out that you can love and care about someone and not be with them every second of their lives. </p><p>Bucky is an adult. And Steve already did what he could to save him. But the thing is: Even if Steve had stayed in the present y'all would have had problems with his life not revolving around Bucky. Because the moment Steve kissed Sharon y'all were down everyone&rsquo;s throats screaming at how everyone was being homophobic for not making a character that has always been straight (both in comics and movies) gay. That&rsquo;s The core of the problem here. </p><p>There I said it: Is not that Steve went to the past&hellip; Is that he did so to be with Peggy and didn&rsquo;t stayed to be Bucky&rsquo;s nanny/lover. I don&rsquo;t know how y'all didn&rsquo;t saw that one coming. The moment it was decided Steve was the one to return the Stones, it was obvious he wasn&rsquo;t coming back. But he did come back. With a bit more life and happiness in his bagagge than before. For all we know&hellip; Steve could live another 100 years before dying of old age. </p><p>And I have such a hard time seing Bucky or Sam holding a grudge over Steve for living his life, on his terms and with someone he loves. He already saved Bucky. He already saved the world. He already helped save the Universe&hellip; There&rsquo;s not much else anyone could ask of him. He already gave everything he had. He already made sure Bucky got a second chance. What Bucky decides to with it is not up to Steve, he doesn&rsquo;t have hold Bucky&rsquo;s hand through it. Their relationship and friendship is strong enough for Bucky to accept and respect what Steve wants.</p><p>Stop acting like Steve is Bucky&rsquo;s nanny. He isn&rsquo;t. Bucky doesn&rsquo;t need one.</p>",

I've been watching anime since I caught a Sailor Moon marathon on Thanksgiving day in 1995. I've been gaming longer than I can remember, starting with my mom's Atari 2600 before getting my own Nintendo Entertainment System. I'd ride my bike to the local library to search anime fansites & read gaming magazines.

                "content": "<p>I saw <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>a second time, and I pretty much felt the same way as the first time: I overall enjoyed and liked it, but some things I disliked too much to really love the film.</p><p>- I think I might have liked it a teensy but more this time, only because I expecting the things that I disliked the first time around, so I wasn&rsquo;t blindsided with&nbsp;&ldquo;wow, I really don&rsquo;t like this&rdquo; emotions.</p><p>- (I mean, I still didn&rsquo;t like the stuff with Thor, and Natasha&rsquo;s death, and there should have been a few less jokes. But with things such as Thor&rsquo;s ending, I felt more resigned than angry this time.)</p><p>- I also ended up crying quite a bit more, because I knew all the emotional moments and started crying in, like, anticipation for those sad moments?</p><p>- Nebula&rsquo;s arc is so good!!! Everything with her and her past self is just perfect. I just love her and her relationship with Gamora so much (and seeing as they&rsquo;ve completed dropped the Thor &amp; Loki relationship, I will live vicariously through this complicated sibling relationship. Seriously, who&rsquo;d have thought the sad, sometimes-murder-y, complicated sister relationship would be better done in the end than the sad, sometimes-murder-y, complicated brother relationship? Not the patriarchy, that&rsquo;s for sure!)</p><p>- After Rocket steals the Aether, the Asgardians running after him shout&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop that rabbit!&rdquo; So it&rsquo;s not just Thor.</p><p>- If that&rsquo;s what an Asgardian rabbit looks like, I&rsquo;m afraid to see what their raccoons looks like.</p><p>- I know that if Clint had died instead of Natasha - after Natasha has been in a hell of a lot more movies and been so central to the team and each of its members - maybe the emotional impact wouldn&rsquo;t have been as great&hellip;<i>but Clint still should have died instead of Natasha</i>. Natasha should live and go retire, maybe with Laura Barton to help her around the farm and with the kids. Something like that.</p><p>- On a rewatch, Bucky <i>definitely</i> knew what Steve was going to do before he did it. That is the face of a man who knows his best friend isn&rsquo;t coming back, at least not for the next 70 years.</p><p>- And&hellip;that&rsquo;s pretty much it. I think I said everything else in my previous blurb.</p><p>- Except that&hellip;every since <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, I&rsquo;ve felt out of step with most of the MCU fandom. The fandom loved <i>T:R</i>, I can&rsquo;t stand it. I loved <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, the fandom hated it. I mostly liked&nbsp;<i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, the fandom&hellip;also hated it.&nbsp;</p><p>- Hell, even with <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, it was just fine in my opinion - not spectacular, but not terrible - and I liked it okay. But according to the fandom it was complete garbage. It was garbage and Joss Whedon was garbage (and this was before his ex-wife spoke about him being shitty - if it was afterward, I&rsquo;d get it, but she hadn&rsquo;t talked about that yet). And now the same thing is happening with the Russos and this movie.</p><p>- This fandom is exhausting. I&rsquo;m exhausted of it. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll get to the point where I&rsquo;ll start blacklisting things and unfollowing people, but&hellip;ugh.</p>",
