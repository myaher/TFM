Should he go over to Chris&rsquo; house or not? Would it even be a good time? Hell, he didn&rsquo;t even know if Jay was over there now that Tegan was living there. Lord, he didn&rsquo;t want to see that smug douchebag with Tegan. His stomach started to curl just by the sheer thought of the two of them. Did it outweigh that Sebastian hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Chris in almost two weeks? No, it didn&rsquo;t. Sebastian knew after what happened at the hospital, it left his relationship with his best friend on thin ice. Chris nor Daphne were speaking to him right now and it made him feel alone.</p><p>They were his best friends in the world and people he turned for advice or problems. It didn&rsquo;t justify that he honestly thought it was Jay&rsquo;s fault for Tegan getting hurt. Excuse him for actually standing up for Tegan knowing she couldn&rsquo;t do it herself. It made his stomach sick seeing Tegan in crutches and bullet wound in her leg. This was her senior year after all and the recital meant the world to her. Now, it was partially put on hold because of the injury. </p><p>Opening the refrigerator, he saw the bottle of Vodka that still remained in there. Lord, he wanted a drink or a cigarette to calm his nerves but it had been almost a month since he stopped. Sebastian took the bottle out of the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. Opening the junk drawer, he saw a pack of cigarettes that still remained. Back and forth in Sebastian&rsquo;s head to have one or not. </p><!-- more --><p>Sebastian took the bottle and threw it against the wall hearing it shatter on the floor. It was a pure and simple distraction for him. It would never solve his problem and would only make it worse. Sinking deeper and deeper with the possibility of never getting out. He couldn&rsquo;t risk it now, not with so much progress that was already achieved. Taking the cigarettes, Sebastian went to the bathroom and threw them down the toilet. This wasn&rsquo;t going to set him back. </p><p>Looking in the mirror, he could see the dark circles that remained underneath his eyes. The few gray hairs that remained in his beard signifying that he wasn&rsquo;t getting any younger and yet settled down. Almost as if time was running out for him to find someone and to just be happy. Maybe one day that would happen but until then, it was best to work on himself. </p><p>Sebastian took one last look at himself and realized that he needed to fix this. He needed to talk to Chris and or Daphne. Apologize and make it right. Leaving the bathroom, Sebastian grabbed his leather jacket, keys, wallet and left the apartment. The cold air hit in his lungs the moment he stepped outside. Hailing a taxi, Sebastian was on his way to his best friend&rsquo;s house to hopefully make it right.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As the taxi drove through the streets of Chicago, Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t help but remember the first time he saw Tegan dance. It was almost like love at first sight. The look of happiness radiated off her as she moved across the stage. The world just seemed to fade in his eyes as the attention was only on her. </p><p><i><b>Three Years ago - Fall Semester.</b></i><br/></p><p><i>Sebastian had just moved down to Chicago from New York. It was the start of a new life for him. Not like he was leaving anything behind besides painful memories of a life that once was there. He had found a nice apartment overlooking Lake Michigan, a newly appointed title of a History Professor at Colombia and a new start of life. At the same time, Chris was also appointed as a History Professor and moved with Sebastian. This was the perfect time to start a new life, maybe love would find them both.</i></p><p><i>Sebastian looked at himself in the mirror as he got dressed. He had a white dress shirt with black slacks and blazer. His black tie was perfectly tucked behind the jacket. Slipping on his black dress shoes, Sebastian grabbed his wallet and headed out of the apartment. Walking outside, Chris had pulled up in his Black 2013 Nissan 370Z. Opening the car door, Sebastian just shook his head at his best friend. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice car. Just bought it?&rdquo; Sebastian snickered as they sped off through the city of Chicago. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I thought since I got a new job, a new car was in the works. Come on, it&rsquo;s a nice car. If you ever need to borrow it for a date, you are more than welcome to.&rdquo; Chris was focused on the road as he drove. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit anxious at this new job. There was going to be a lot expected of them and hopefully, they could handle the task. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Eh, right now, I am focused on the job. If I find the right person then it will work itself out, but right now the job will be number one.&rdquo; Chris nodded his head in agreement with Sebastian&rsquo;s words but couldn&rsquo;t help but feel alone at the same time. He just hoped there was someone out there for him as well.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are right. When we meet the right person, it will just happen.&rdquo; Chris pulled into the parking lot and took a good look at there new job. It was a huge campus with several different buildings. Different showcases flooded the light poles up high. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head in and meet the staff.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>With that, Sebastian and Chris left the car and made their way towards the college. Sebastian noticed several women were definitely checking them out but none seemed to catch his eye. They were just &ldquo;eh&rdquo; to him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe this won&rsquo;t be so bad after all,&rdquo; Chris turned around watching some of the women pass right by him and flashed a pretty boy smile. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo; Sebastian laughed as they entered the office building. Just then two gentlemen approached them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You must be our new professors. I want to be the first to welcome you to Colombia. My name is Jack Stevens and I am the President of Colombia.&rdquo; Jack extended his hand out to shake there hands. &ldquo;I also would like to introduce you to both our deans, this is Dean Kevin Alter and this is assistant Dean Megan Albright&rdquo; Sebastian and Chris shock both of there hands as well. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have both of you here. I know the students will be looking forward to there new teachers. We do have an assembly in a few moments, so how about we take you there and then go around the campus.&rdquo; Dean Kevin suggested.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course, lead the way,&rdquo; Chris said following in Kevin&rsquo;s direction. Sebastian turned his attention to Megan who was definitely checking him out by the flirty eyes she was giving him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, Sebastian. Where did you move from?&rdquo; Megan asked with a smile on her face. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We both moved from New York about a week ago.&rdquo; Sebastian was looking around the campus as they walked outside, doing his best to distract himself.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow, New York. I always wanted to go. Any particular reason why you moved?&rdquo; Megan looked up at Sebastian and flashed a smile. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Megan, I am sure that&rsquo;s personal.&rdquo; Kevin looked over at her and gave her a stern look. Sebastian just focused on walking towards the gym, not listening to what anyone was saying. </i></p><p><i>His mind was elsewhere as his body did the work. The next forty-five minutes were spent in the gym introducing Chris and himself to the school. Most of the woman in the room were dead focused on them. In his mind, this was going to be exactly like New York where most of the female students were trying to get him. This wasn&rsquo;t the type of woman he wanted. Sebastian wanted someone down to earth, sweet, kind, with a tough side to her. Someone who wasn&rsquo;t easy and just wanted to get laid by him. Was this girl even around? </i></p><p><i>Once the assembly was over with, Kevin had dismissed Megan back to the office and decided to show them around the campus. Both Chris and Sebastian would be sharing the same office room. Several other important places were also shown including the cafeteria, the library, along with some other professors as well. Next came the rooms they both would be teaching their classes in. The rooms were close to each other only being separated by another classroom in the middle. </i></p><p><i>Both Sebastian and Chris would have two different class of students with one being Monday and Wednesday at 11 am and then Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am being the other. It was slightly different than most colleges but Colombia was a much smaller school than Harvard or Yale. So the student ratio was about half. It honestly didn&rsquo;t bother him as much because it meant less work to grade. </i></p><p><i>The auditorium was the last place that was shown and the moment Sebastian walked into - he nearly slammed into a post. There on stage was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her brunette hair was pinned up, the curves in all the right places and the way she flowed across the stage. The moment she spun around, Sebastian noticed her smile. The feeling of his heart hammered against his chest and started to feel a bit of sweat form. This had completely caught him off guard. </i></p><p><i>Who was this girl and why was this happening to him? He had to get to know her. What was her name? Who was that guy on stage with her? Did she have a boyfriend? Was she single? So many questions plagued his mind just watching her dance across the stage. But before he could finish watching her dance, they left the auditorium and back to the office. </i></p><p><i><b>Two Hours Later</b></i></p><p><i>Sebastian and Chris had just come out of the office after spending the last two hours finalizing the paperwork. His mind was still on the beautiful girl dancing on stage and wanting to know about her. Doubt started to take over wondering if he would ever see her again. It was a pretty big campus but Dean Kevin had reassured him that in order to graduate there class was a requirement. So, there was that piece of information that brought his mind at ease. Maybe he would see her again, just didn&rsquo;t know when that would be. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some coffee, I don&rsquo;t know about you but I could see a pick me up,&rdquo; Chris said bringing Sebastian out of his thoughts that plagued his mind. Nodding in agreement, he followed in the direction of the small coffee shop that was nearby. </i></p><p><i>Just as they were both walking in line a brunette and a man with dark hair walked in front of them taking their place in line. Both of them got in line behind them as Sebastian&rsquo;s mind was elsewhere. Chris watched looked over at his best friend and could see something was plaguing his mind.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; Chris nudged him causing Sebastian to give him the stink eye. &ldquo;You have been awfully quiet these past few hours.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am perfectly fine. There is just a lot that needs to be done and figuring it out.&rdquo; Sebastian focused on the female in front of him and noticed that she looked familiar. </i></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you Tegan, but this is going to be the best four years of our life. We are going to dance our best selves and maybe find someone special.&rdquo; Travis nudged her causing her to smile. They both had been on a high since they left the auditorium. Just the sheer thought of them dancing in front of crowds and making people smile. It was the one thing they both wanted to do. This was their passion. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes it will be but I think I will let the finding someone special take a backseat. I just want to focus on us. We are going to be partners after all right, T&rdquo; Tegan smiled over her new best friend. From the moment they met, it was an instant friendship and Tegan couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;T, I like that as a nickname. What about you T?&rdquo; Travis laughed as they moved up in the line. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I kinda like that as a nickname too.&rdquo; Both of them couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing causing a few people to stare at them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What can I get you miss?&rdquo; the barista asked </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A hot chocolate with peppermint and no whip cream,&rdquo; Tegan said looking at the muffins as well and realized that they hadn&rsquo;t even eaten yet. &ldquo;Oh and a banana muffin.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;For you sir?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A hot chocolate and a blueberry muffin,&rdquo; Travis said looking at the muffins as well as his own stomach growled. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Name for the order?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Tegan Mitchell.&rdquo; Travis pulled out his wallet to hand Tegan some money but stopped him. &ldquo;My treat.&rdquo; Tegan handed the barista the money and stood to the side.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Next one is on me.&rdquo; Travis turned around facing the outside of the small shop and noticed that someone was checking Tegan out. His eyes were only focused on her and couldn&rsquo;t deny that the guy was pretty handsome. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look now, but there is a guy completely checking you out.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Tegan turned her head slightly and saw that indeed there was a guy checking her out. \u00a0That wasn&rsquo;t the only catching her eye as several women behind them were also checking out the guy as they giggled. Tegan couldn&rsquo;t deny that he was attractive with his chiseled jaw, blue eyes and pretty boy smile. This was definitely the type of guy that would just break her heart and not even care. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;name for the order.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s when Tegan heard his name - Sebastian. Turning her attention back towards Travis who was holding her hot chocolate and muffin in his hand with a smirk. Tegan took both of them and gave him a small smile as Travis was trying to hold in the snicker.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tegan asked as they walked out of the coffee shop.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Just there is a completely hot guy checking you out and you are ignoring it. It&rsquo;s adorable.&rdquo; Travis looked over at Tegan and could see that there were a few tears coming down her cheek. &ldquo;I am sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay. Just something from my past that I haven&rsquo;t been able to let go. How about we go find somewhere to sit and eat. Maybe tell you the story?&rdquo; Tegan suggested as they started to walk off campus and saw a small park nearby. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; \u00a0Travis said as they found a bench and settled down on the seat.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, I think I need to get this off my chest.&rdquo; Tegan took a deep breath and started to tell Travis the story of the events. There was no way she would ever fall for that pretty boy type ever again. They were nothing but bad news.</i></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i></p><p><i>Lord, she was even beautiful up close with the small freckles on her cheeks, her short little frame as he was more than a foot taller than her, there were a sparkle in her eyes and a glow behind her smile. That\u2019s when Sebastian heard her first name \u201cTegan\u201d which meant \u201cdarling\u201d, \u201cloved one\u201d and \u201cfavourite\u201d which fitted her so perfectly. His only attention was on listening to what she was saying - the guy&rsquo;s name was Travis, ordered a peppermint hot chocolate without any whip cream which meant she probably wasn\u2019t into sweets that much and a banana muffin to resemble some sort of healthiness. That\u2019s when he heard her last name \u201cMitchell\u201d - \u201cTegan Mitchell\u201d.</i></p><p><i>Chris could see that his best friend was staring at a girl in front of him. It was the same girl who was dancing on stage in the auditorium. Sebastian had the same look there that he did right now looking at her. Turning his attention to the barista to his order than turned his attention to Sebastian who was elsewhere. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sebastian?&rdquo; Chris poked him in the arm bring him back to reality. Sebastian turned his attention to the barista and gave his order. &ldquo;Just a black coffee.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Name for the order.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sebastian&rdquo; Sebastian answered and turned back around to see Tegan had left with Travis as they walked outside. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a piece of him was missing the moment she left. The fact he didn&rsquo;t know this girl at all and simply by her leaving had left him empty inside? What in the world was happening and why was he feeling like this? Taking his coffee, they walked out in the cool September air and headed towards there car. </i></p><p><i>Maybe the move to Chicago wasn&rsquo;t going to be bad after all. </i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>That day still played in his head as the car drove through the city. That this girl had been in his dreams for four years. Four very long years. In that time, his feelings only grew stronger and stronger. He was desperately trying to figure it all out but still came up with no answer as to why Tegan had this effect on him. </p><p>That one day, Sebastian would ask her out on a date and show her the world. A new sense of determination took over inside of him now. Fate wouldn&rsquo;t be so cruel as to flash her in front of him not for them to get together. Whatever the reason for Tegan, he just hoped to figure it out soon. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, we are here.&rdquo; Sebastian&rsquo;s attention turned towards the taxi driver as it arrived at Chris house. Handing him the money, Sebastian exited the taxi and walked up to the house. The beating of his heart thumped against his chest as he walked up to the door. Lightly knocking on the door, he waited for someone to answer the door.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sebastian, what are you doing here? It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo; Chris said looking at his best friend standing in his doorway at 11p at night.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to talk to you.&rdquo; Sebastian walked right into the house and stopped dead as to who was in the living room. </p><p>&ldquo;Just come right in.&rdquo; Chris rolled his eyes and closed the door. &ldquo;Not here.&rdquo; Chris lead Sebastian out of the living room and to the backyard. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is he doing here?&rdquo; Sebastian turned around and looked at Chris who was closing the sliding glass door.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay was helping me load stuff out of Tegan&rsquo;s apartment. It was getting late and Daphne had him stay for dinner. I honestly don&rsquo;t see how any of this is your business. You aren&rsquo;t dating Tegan, Sebastian. Another thing, if you saw that place Tegan was staying in you would understand. Tegan is going to be staying here but of course, you already knew that. It isn&rsquo;t Jay&rsquo;s fault Tegan got hurt. Her neighbors moved into the apartment next to her and were planning on kidnapping her to use as a sex slave. We haven&rsquo;t told Tegan any of this because honestly, she doesn&rsquo;t need to know that. </p><p>But I am so sick and tired of YOU blaming Jay. Tegan and Jay are together right now. You are just going to have to get used to that. If you don&rsquo;t like it then there&rsquo;s the door&rdquo; Chris pointed towards the back door and continued on, &ldquo;I am not going to keep tolerating this from you. You are my best friend in the world but Tegan is family. I won&rsquo;t have you upsetting her, getting the way of her relationship, filling her head with lies or hurting her. Is any of this even registering with you?&rdquo; Chris stared at Sebastian who was focused on something else. Maybe he was trying to process this information or maybe figuring out what to say. The complete blank facial expression on Sebastian&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t sit too well with Chris. &ldquo;SEBASTIAN!&rdquo;</p><p>Sebastian turned his attention towards Chris was looking at him seriously. He couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was actually hearing. That someone so evil wanted to use Tegan like that. Just the pure thought of it made his blood boil. He was thankful for Jay getting the person responsible for hurting Tegan but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from disliking the guy. THAT was always going to remain no matter what as long as Jay was with Tegan. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you even listening to me?&rdquo; Chris was way beyond annoyed now. His best friend wasn&rsquo;t even listening to him which annoyed him even more. </p><p>&ldquo;Chris, I am sorry for being an ass. We all know that I can be a huge asshole and I am sorry. You are completely right and I shouldn&rsquo;t have jumped to conclusions regarding Jay. Tegan is allowed to date anyone that she wants and I have no say otherwise. &rdquo; Sebastian took a seat on one of the chairs and watched Chris followed suit himself. &ldquo;I am not going to deny or pretend that I don&rsquo;t have feelings for Tegan. I do, but I am not going to interfere with them. If it&rsquo;s meant to be then it will happen.&rdquo; Sebastian looked up at the stars and saw there was a meteor that went across the sky. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Sebastian made a small wish on that night with the meteor in the sky. <i>&ldquo;Just let Tegan see me.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Would either of you like a beer?&rdquo; Daphne made her way towards the two of them sitting on the porch.</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Daphne.&rdquo; Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne. &ldquo;Look Daph, I know I am not your favorite person right now and I fucked up a lot. I am sorry for being an ass at the hospital and in general. I shouldn&rsquo;t have acted that way at all. Tegan is allowed to date who she wants too as long as she is happy that is all that matters. I just have to accept it.&rdquo; Sebastian looked down at his hands and wish there was a cigarette here to ease this anxiety he was feeling right now. Feeling a hand on his shoulder, Sebastian looked up and saw it was Daphne.</p><p>&ldquo;Look Seb, I know you have feelings for Tegan. I have known for three years, mind you, but Tegan is with Jay. I am not going to lie, I like Jay. I think he&rsquo;s good for her especially after what happened in high school. If it&rsquo;s meant to be, things will work out the way they are supposed to but until then, there is nothing wrong with being her friend. That&rsquo;s how it happened with us too. I was dating some douchebag asshole named Marcus who I later found out was cheating on me. The day after we broke up, Chris came over with flowers and a bottle of wine. We stayed up all night by the fire and just talked to one another. One thing led to another and Chris kissed me that night. I realized that breaking up with Marcus was the best thing ever because I realized that I was in love with Chris.&rdquo; Daphne had walked over towards Chris and took a seat on his lap. She placed a small kiss on his lips and then rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I think what Daphne is trying to say is - friendship is the best base for a relationship. Spend time with her and get to know her as a FRIEND. Let her get to know you as well. Just don&rsquo;t be a slick and kiss her when she&rsquo;s dating Jay. Let it naturally just happened. I understand that you have feelings for her. I have known since the first day we saw her in the auditorium and in the coffee shop.&rdquo; Chris was doing his best not to laugh as he continued, &ldquo;Lord knows you just kept staring at her the whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Daphne started to laugh as she looked over at Sebastian. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, laugh it up at my expense.&rdquo; Sebastian just rolled his eyes as both of them were now making fun of him. If he knew they would be laughing at him, he would have never come over in the first place. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean it was adorable sweetie.&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; attention was now on Daphne then looked over at Sebastian. &ldquo;He was kind of star-struck.&rdquo; Daphne looked over at Sebastian who wasn&rsquo;t even paying attention to the conversation at this point. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Seb?&rdquo; Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne who looking at him. &ldquo;We forgive you. Just don&rsquo;t do anything to mess up Tegan&rsquo;s relationship and just be friends with her. That&rsquo;s what she needs.&rdquo; Daphne could still see it was eating him up inside but Tegan&rsquo;s happiness was more important than anything. </p><p>Sebastian just looked up at the stars and watched as the meteors light up the night sky. He secretly wished that Tegan was laying here with him to watch it. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was fate or his wish was coming true but Sebastian turned his head towards the sliding glass door which had opened. His heart was now hammering in his chest at the sight walking towards him.</p><p>There in front of him was Tegan with a small smile on her face. </p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: </b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzhZCk1C1501DeGVnvo77ow\">@moonriv-err</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

Should he go over to Chris\u2019 house or not? Would it even be a good time? Hell, he didn\u2019t even know if Jay was over there now that Tegan was living there. Lord, he didn\u2019t want to see that smug douchebag with Tegan. His stomach started to curl just by the sheer thought of the two of them. Did it outweigh that Sebastian hadn\u2019t spoken to Chris in almost two weeks? No, it didn\u2019t. Sebastian knew after what happened at the hospital, it left his relationship with his best friend on thin ice. Chris nor Daphne were speaking to him right now and it made him feel alone.</p><p>They were his best friends in the world and people he turned for advice or problems. It didn\u2019t justify that he honestly thought it was Jay\u2019s fault for Tegan getting hurt. Excuse him for actually standing up for Tegan knowing she couldn\u2019t do it herself. It made his stomach sick seeing Tegan in crutches and bullet wound in her leg. This was her senior year after all and the recital meant the world to her. Now, it was partially put on hold because of the injury. </p><p>Opening the refrigerator, he saw the bottle of Vodka that still remained in there. Lord, he wanted a drink or a cigarette to calm his nerves but it had been almost a month since he stopped. Sebastian took the bottle out of the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. Opening the junk drawer, he saw a pack of cigarettes that still remained. Back and forth in Sebastian\u2019s head to have one or not. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sebastian took the bottle and threw it against the wall hearing it shatter on the floor. It was a pure and simple distraction for him. It would never solve his problem and would only make it worse. Sinking deeper and deeper with the possibility of never getting out. He couldn\u2019t risk it now, not with so much progress that was already achieved. Taking the cigarettes, Sebastian went to the bathroom and threw them down the toilet. This wasn\u2019t going to set him back. </p><p>Looking in the mirror, he could see the dark circles that remained underneath his eyes. The few gray hairs that remained in his beard signifying that he wasn\u2019t getting any younger and yet settled down. Almost as if time was running out for him to find someone and to just be happy. Maybe one day that would happen but until then, it was best to work on himself. </p><p>Sebastian took one last look at himself and realized that he needed to fix this. He needed to talk to Chris and or Daphne. Apologize and make it right. Leaving the bathroom, Sebastian grabbed his leather jacket, keys, wallet and left the apartment. The cold air hit in his lungs the moment he stepped outside. Hailing a taxi, Sebastian was on his way to his best friend\u2019s house to hopefully make it right.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>As the taxi drove through the streets of Chicago, Sebastian couldn\u2019t help but remember the first time he saw Tegan dance. It was almost like love at first sight. The look of happiness radiated off her as she moved across the stage. The world just seemed to fade in his eyes as the attention was only on her. </p><p><i><b>Three Years ago - Fall Semester.</b></i><br></p><p><i>Sebastian had just moved down to Chicago from New York. It was the start of a new life for him. Not like he was leaving anything behind besides painful memories of a life that once was there. He had found a nice apartment overlooking Lake Michigan, a newly appointed title of a History Professor at Colombia and a new start of life. At the same time, Chris was also appointed as a History Professor and moved with Sebastian. This was the perfect time to start a new life, maybe love would find them both.</i></p><p><i>Sebastian looked at himself in the mirror as he got dressed. He had a white dress shirt with black slacks and blazer. His black tie was perfectly tucked behind the jacket. Slipping on his black dress shoes, Sebastian grabbed his wallet and headed out of the apartment. Walking outside, Chris had pulled up in his Black 2013 Nissan 370Z. Opening the car door, Sebastian just shook his head at his best friend. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNice car. Just bought it?\u201d Sebastian snickered as they sped off through the city of Chicago. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI thought since I got a new job, a new car was in the works. Come on, it\u2019s a nice car. If you ever need to borrow it for a date, you are more than welcome to.\u201d Chris was focused on the road as he drove. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit anxious at this new job. There was going to be a lot expected of them and hopefully, they could handle the task. </i></p><p><i>\u201cEh, right now, I am focused on the job. If I find the right person then it will work itself out, but right now the job will be number one.\u201d Chris nodded his head in agreement with Sebastian\u2019s words but couldn\u2019t help but feel alone at the same time. He just hoped there was someone out there for him as well.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are right. When we meet the right person, it will just happen.\u201d Chris pulled into the parking lot and took a good look at there new job. It was a huge campus with several different buildings. Different showcases flooded the light poles up high. \u201cLet\u2019s head in and meet the staff.\u201d </i></p><p><i>With that, Sebastian and Chris left the car and made their way towards the college. Sebastian noticed several women were definitely checking them out but none seemed to catch his eye. They were just \u201ceh\u201d to him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all,\u201d Chris turned around watching some of the women pass right by him and flashed a pretty boy smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Sebastian laughed as they entered the office building. Just then two gentlemen approached them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must be our new professors. I want to be the first to welcome you to Colombia. My name is Jack Stevens and I am the President of Colombia.\u201d Jack extended his hand out to shake there hands. \u201cI also would like to introduce you to both our deans, this is Dean Kevin Alter and this is assistant Dean Megan Albright\u201d Sebastian and Chris shock both of there hands as well. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have both of you here. I know the students will be looking forward to there new teachers. We do have an assembly in a few moments, so how about we take you there and then go around the campus.\u201d Dean Kevin suggested.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, lead the way,\u201d Chris said following in Kevin\u2019s direction. Sebastian turned his attention to Megan who was definitely checking him out by the flirty eyes she was giving him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sebastian. Where did you move from?\u201d Megan asked with a smile on her face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe both moved from New York about a week ago.\u201d Sebastian was looking around the campus as they walked outside, doing his best to distract himself.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow, New York. I always wanted to go. Any particular reason why you moved?\u201d Megan looked up at Sebastian and flashed a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMegan, I am sure that\u2019s personal.\u201d Kevin looked over at her and gave her a stern look. Sebastian just focused on walking towards the gym, not listening to what anyone was saying. </i></p><p><i>His mind was elsewhere as his body did the work. The next forty-five minutes were spent in the gym introducing Chris and himself to the school. Most of the woman in the room were dead focused on them. In his mind, this was going to be exactly like New York where most of the female students were trying to get him. This wasn\u2019t the type of woman he wanted. Sebastian wanted someone down to earth, sweet, kind, with a tough side to her. Someone who wasn\u2019t easy and just wanted to get laid by him. Was this girl even around? </i></p><p><i>Once the assembly was over with, Kevin had dismissed Megan back to the office and decided to show them around the campus. Both Chris and Sebastian would be sharing the same office room. Several other important places were also shown including the cafeteria, the library, along with some other professors as well. Next came the rooms they both would be teaching their classes in. The rooms were close to each other only being separated by another classroom in the middle. </i></p><p><i>Both Sebastian and Chris would have two different class of students with one being Monday and Wednesday at 11 am and then Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am being the other. It was slightly different than most colleges but Colombia was a much smaller school than Harvard or Yale. So the student ratio was about half. It honestly didn\u2019t bother him as much because it meant less work to grade. </i></p><p><i>The auditorium was the last place that was shown and the moment Sebastian walked into - he nearly slammed into a post. There on stage was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her brunette hair was pinned up, the curves in all the right places and the way she flowed across the stage. The moment she spun around, Sebastian noticed her smile. The feeling of his heart hammered against his chest and started to feel a bit of sweat form. This had completely caught him off guard. </i></p><p><i>Who was this girl and why was this happening to him? He had to get to know her. What was her name? Who was that guy on stage with her? Did she have a boyfriend? Was she single? So many questions plagued his mind just watching her dance across the stage. But before he could finish watching her dance, they left the auditorium and back to the office. </i></p><p><i><b>Two Hours Later</b></i></p><p><i>Sebastian and Chris had just come out of the office after spending the last two hours finalizing the paperwork. His mind was still on the beautiful girl dancing on stage and wanting to know about her. Doubt started to take over wondering if he would ever see her again. It was a pretty big campus but Dean Kevin had reassured him that in order to graduate there class was a requirement. So, there was that piece of information that brought his mind at ease. Maybe he would see her again, just didn\u2019t know when that would be. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s get some coffee, I don\u2019t know about you but I could see a pick me up,\u201d Chris said bringing Sebastian out of his thoughts that plagued his mind. Nodding in agreement, he followed in the direction of the small coffee shop that was nearby. </i></p><p><i>Just as they were both walking in line a brunette and a man with dark hair walked in front of them taking their place in line. Both of them got in line behind them as Sebastian\u2019s mind was elsewhere. Chris watched looked over at his best friend and could see something was plaguing his mind.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Chris nudged him causing Sebastian to give him the stink eye. \u201cYou have been awfully quiet these past few hours.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am perfectly fine. There is just a lot that needs to be done and figuring it out.\u201d Sebastian focused on the female in front of him and noticed that she looked familiar. </i></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you Tegan, but this is going to be the best four years of our life. We are going to dance our best selves and maybe find someone special.\u201d Travis nudged her causing her to smile. They both had been on a high since they left the auditorium. Just the sheer thought of them dancing in front of crowds and making people smile. It was the one thing they both wanted to do. This was their passion. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes it will be but I think I will let the finding someone special take a backseat. I just want to focus on us. We are going to be partners after all right, T\u201d Tegan smiled over her new best friend. From the moment they met, it was an instant friendship and Tegan couldn\u2019t have been happier. </i></p><p><i>\u201cT, I like that as a nickname. What about you T?\u201d Travis laughed as they moved up in the line. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI kinda like that as a nickname too.\u201d Both of them couldn\u2019t stop laughing causing a few people to stare at them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat can I get you miss?\u201d the barista asked </i></p><p><i>\u201cA hot chocolate with peppermint and no whip cream,\u201d Tegan said looking at the muffins as well and realized that they hadn\u2019t even eaten yet. \u201cOh and a banana muffin.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cFor you sir?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cA hot chocolate and a blueberry muffin,\u201d Travis said looking at the muffins as well as his own stomach growled. </i></p><p><i>\u201cName for the order?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cTegan Mitchell.\u201d Travis pulled out his wallet to hand Tegan some money but stopped him. \u201cMy treat.\u201d Tegan handed the barista the money and stood to the side.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNext one is on me.\u201d Travis turned around facing the outside of the small shop and noticed that someone was checking Tegan out. His eyes were only focused on her and couldn\u2019t deny that the guy was pretty handsome. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but there is a guy completely checking you out.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tegan turned her head slightly and saw that indeed there was a guy checking her out. \u00a0That wasn\u2019t the only catching her eye as several women behind them were also checking out the guy as they giggled. Tegan couldn\u2019t deny that he was attractive with his chiseled jaw, blue eyes and pretty boy smile. This was definitely the type of guy that would just break her heart and not even care. </i></p><p><i>\u201cname for the order.\u201d </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s when Tegan heard his name - Sebastian. Turning her attention back towards Travis who was holding her hot chocolate and muffin in his hand with a smirk. Tegan took both of them and gave him a small smile as Travis was trying to hold in the snicker.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tegan asked as they walked out of the coffee shop.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, nothing. Just there is a completely hot guy checking you out and you are ignoring it. It\u2019s adorable.\u201d Travis looked over at Tegan and could see that there were a few tears coming down her cheek. \u201cI am sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Just something from my past that I haven\u2019t been able to let go. How about we go find somewhere to sit and eat. Maybe tell you the story?\u201d Tegan suggested as they started to walk off campus and saw a small park nearby. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d \u00a0Travis said as they found a bench and settled down on the seat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cit\u2019s okay, I think I need to get this off my chest.\u201d Tegan took a deep breath and started to tell Travis the story of the events. There was no way she would ever fall for that pretty boy type ever again. They were nothing but bad news.</i></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</i></p><p><i>Lord, she was even beautiful up close with the small freckles on her cheeks, her short little frame as he was more than a foot taller than her, there were a sparkle in her eyes and a glow behind her smile. That\u2019s when Sebastian heard her first name \u201cTegan\u201d which meant \u201cdarling\u201d, \u201cloved one\u201d and \u201cfavourite\u201d which fitted her so perfectly. His only attention was on listening to what she was saying - the guy\u2019s name was Travis, ordered a peppermint hot chocolate without any whip cream which meant she probably wasn\u2019t into sweets that much and a banana muffin to resemble some sort of healthiness. That\u2019s when he heard her last name \u201cMitchell\u201d - \u201cTegan Mitchell\u201d.</i></p><p><i>Chris could see that his best friend was staring at a girl in front of him. It was the same girl who was dancing on stage in the auditorium. Sebastian had the same look there that he did right now looking at her. Turning his attention to the barista to his order than turned his attention to Sebastian who was elsewhere. </i></p><p><i>\u201cSebastian?\u201d Chris poked him in the arm bring him back to reality. Sebastian turned his attention to the barista and gave his order. \u201cJust a black coffee.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cName for the order.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSebastian\u201d Sebastian answered and turned back around to see Tegan had left with Travis as they walked outside. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a piece of him was missing the moment she left. The fact he didn\u2019t know this girl at all and simply by her leaving had left him empty inside? What in the world was happening and why was he feeling like this? Taking his coffee, they walked out in the cool September air and headed towards there car. </i></p><p><i>Maybe the move to Chicago wasn\u2019t going to be bad after all. </i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>That day still played in his head as the car drove through the city. That this girl had been in his dreams for four years. Four very long years. In that time, his feelings only grew stronger and stronger. He was desperately trying to figure it all out but still came up with no answer as to why Tegan had this effect on him. </p><p>That one day, Sebastian would ask her out on a date and show her the world. A new sense of determination took over inside of him now. Fate wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to flash her in front of him not for them to get together. Whatever the reason for Tegan, he just hoped to figure it out soon. </p><p>\u201cSir, we are here.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s attention turned towards the taxi driver as it arrived at Chris house. Handing him the money, Sebastian exited the taxi and walked up to the house. The beating of his heart thumped against his chest as he walked up to the door. Lightly knocking on the door, he waited for someone to answer the door.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cSebastian, what are you doing here? It\u2019s late.\u201d Chris said looking at his best friend standing in his doorway at 11p at night.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Sebastian walked right into the house and stopped dead as to who was in the living room. </p><p>\u201cJust come right in.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes and closed the door. \u201cNot here.\u201d Chris lead Sebastian out of the living room and to the backyard. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d Sebastian turned around and looked at Chris who was closing the sliding glass door.</p><p>\u201cJay was helping me load stuff out of Tegan\u2019s apartment. It was getting late and Daphne had him stay for dinner. I honestly don\u2019t see how any of this is your business. You aren\u2019t dating Tegan, Sebastian. Another thing, if you saw that place Tegan was staying in you would understand. Tegan is going to be staying here but of course, you already knew that. It isn\u2019t Jay\u2019s fault Tegan got hurt. Her neighbors moved into the apartment next to her and were planning on kidnapping her to use as a sex slave. We haven\u2019t told Tegan any of this because honestly, she doesn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>But I am so sick and tired of YOU blaming Jay. Tegan and Jay are together right now. You are just going to have to get used to that. If you don\u2019t like it then there\u2019s the door\u201d Chris pointed towards the back door and continued on, \u201cI am not going to keep tolerating this from you. You are my best friend in the world but Tegan is family. I won\u2019t have you upsetting her, getting the way of her relationship, filling her head with lies or hurting her. Is any of this even registering with you?\u201d Chris stared at Sebastian who was focused on something else. Maybe he was trying to process this information or maybe figuring out what to say. The complete blank facial expression on Sebastian\u2019s face didn\u2019t sit too well with Chris. \u201cSEBASTIAN!\u201d</p><p>Sebastian turned his attention towards Chris was looking at him seriously. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was actually hearing. That someone so evil wanted to use Tegan like that. Just the pure thought of it made his blood boil. He was thankful for Jay getting the person responsible for hurting Tegan but it didn\u2019t stop him from disliking the guy. THAT was always going to remain no matter what as long as Jay was with Tegan. </p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d Chris was way beyond annoyed now. His best friend wasn\u2019t even listening to him which annoyed him even more. </p><p>\u201cChris, I am sorry for being an ass. We all know that I can be a huge asshole and I am sorry. You are completely right and I shouldn\u2019t have jumped to conclusions regarding Jay. Tegan is allowed to date anyone that she wants and I have no say otherwise. \u201d Sebastian took a seat on one of the chairs and watched Chris followed suit himself. \u201cI am not going to deny or pretend that I don\u2019t have feelings for Tegan. I do, but I am not going to interfere with them. If it\u2019s meant to be then it will happen.\u201d Sebastian looked up at the stars and saw there was a meteor that went across the sky. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Sebastian made a small wish on that night with the meteor in the sky. <i>\u201cJust let Tegan see me.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWould either of you like a beer?\u201d Daphne made her way towards the two of them sitting on the porch.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Daphne.\u201d Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne. \u201cLook Daph, I know I am not your favorite person right now and I fucked up a lot. I am sorry for being an ass at the hospital and in general. I shouldn\u2019t have acted that way at all. Tegan is allowed to date who she wants too as long as she is happy that is all that matters. I just have to accept it.\u201d Sebastian looked down at his hands and wish there was a cigarette here to ease this anxiety he was feeling right now. Feeling a hand on his shoulder, Sebastian looked up and saw it was Daphne.</p><p>\u201cLook Seb, I know you have feelings for Tegan. I have known for three years, mind you, but Tegan is with Jay. I am not going to lie, I like Jay. I think he\u2019s good for her especially after what happened in high school. If it\u2019s meant to be, things will work out the way they are supposed to but until then, there is nothing wrong with being her friend. That\u2019s how it happened with us too. I was dating some douchebag asshole named Marcus who I later found out was cheating on me. The day after we broke up, Chris came over with flowers and a bottle of wine. We stayed up all night by the fire and just talked to one another. One thing led to another and Chris kissed me that night. I realized that breaking up with Marcus was the best thing ever because I realized that I was in love with Chris.\u201d Daphne had walked over towards Chris and took a seat on his lap. She placed a small kiss on his lips and then rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI think what Daphne is trying to say is - friendship is the best base for a relationship. Spend time with her and get to know her as a FRIEND. Let her get to know you as well. Just don\u2019t be a slick and kiss her when she\u2019s dating Jay. Let it naturally just happened. I understand that you have feelings for her. I have known since the first day we saw her in the auditorium and in the coffee shop.\u201d Chris was doing his best not to laugh as he continued, \u201cLord knows you just kept staring at her the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Daphne started to laugh as she looked over at Sebastian. </p><p>\u201cYes, laugh it up at my expense.\u201d Sebastian just rolled his eyes as both of them were now making fun of him. If he knew they would be laughing at him, he would have never come over in the first place. </p><p>\u201cI mean it was adorable sweetie.\u201d Chris\u2019 attention was now on Daphne then looked over at Sebastian. \u201cHe was kind of star-struck.\u201d Daphne looked over at Sebastian who wasn\u2019t even paying attention to the conversation at this point. </p><p>\u201cHey, Seb?\u201d Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne who looking at him. \u201cWe forgive you. Just don\u2019t do anything to mess up Tegan\u2019s relationship and just be friends with her. That\u2019s what she needs.\u201d Daphne could still see it was eating him up inside but Tegan\u2019s happiness was more important than anything. </p><p>Sebastian just looked up at the stars and watched as the meteors light up the night sky. He secretly wished that Tegan was laying here with him to watch it. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was fate or his wish was coming true but Sebastian turned his head towards the sliding glass door which had opened. His heart was now hammering in his chest at the sight walking towards him.</p><p>There in front of him was Tegan with a small smile on her face. </p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: </b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzhZCk1C1501DeGVnvo77ow\">@moonriv-err</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

Should he go over to Chris\u2019 house or not? Would it even be a good time? Hell, he didn\u2019t even know if Jay was over there now that Tegan was living there. Lord, he didn\u2019t want to see that smug douchebag with Tegan. His stomach started to curl just by the sheer thought of the two of them. Did it outweigh that Sebastian hadn\u2019t spoken to Chris in almost two weeks? No, it didn\u2019t. Sebastian knew after what happened at the hospital, it left his relationship with his best friend on thin ice. Chris nor Daphne were speaking to him right now and it made him feel alone.</p><p>They were his best friends in the world and people he turned for advice or problems. It didn\u2019t justify that he honestly thought it was Jay\u2019s fault for Tegan getting hurt. Excuse him for actually standing up for Tegan knowing she couldn\u2019t do it herself. It made his stomach sick seeing Tegan in crutches and bullet wound in her leg. This was her senior year after all and the recital meant the world to her. Now, it was partially put on hold because of the injury. </p><p>Opening the refrigerator, he saw the bottle of Vodka that still remained in there. Lord, he wanted a drink or a cigarette to calm his nerves but it had been almost a month since he stopped. Sebastian took the bottle out of the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. Opening the junk drawer, he saw a pack of cigarettes that still remained. Back and forth in Sebastian\u2019s head to have one or not. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Sebastian took the bottle and threw it against the wall hearing it shatter on the floor. It was a pure and simple distraction for him. It would never solve his problem and would only make it worse. Sinking deeper and deeper with the possibility of never getting out. He couldn\u2019t risk it now, not with so much progress that was already achieved. Taking the cigarettes, Sebastian went to the bathroom and threw them down the toilet. This wasn\u2019t going to set him back. </p><p>Looking in the mirror, he could see the dark circles that remained underneath his eyes. The few gray hairs that remained in his beard signifying that he wasn\u2019t getting any younger and yet settled down. Almost as if time was running out for him to find someone and to just be happy. Maybe one day that would happen but until then, it was best to work on himself. </p><p>Sebastian took one last look at himself and realized that he needed to fix this. He needed to talk to Chris and or Daphne. Apologize and make it right. Leaving the bathroom, Sebastian grabbed his leather jacket, keys, wallet and left the apartment. The cold air hit in his lungs the moment he stepped outside. Hailing a taxi, Sebastian was on his way to his best friend\u2019s house to hopefully make it right.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>As the taxi drove through the streets of Chicago, Sebastian couldn\u2019t help but remember the first time he saw Tegan dance. It was almost like love at first sight. The look of happiness radiated off her as she moved across the stage. The world just seemed to fade in his eyes as the attention was only on her. </p><p><i><b>Three Years ago - Fall Semester.</b></i><br></p><p><i>Sebastian had just moved down to Chicago from New York. It was the start of a new life for him. Not like he was leaving anything behind besides painful memories of a life that once was there. He had found a nice apartment overlooking Lake Michigan, a newly appointed title of a History Professor at Colombia and a new start of life. At the same time, Chris was also appointed as a History Professor and moved with Sebastian. This was the perfect time to start a new life, maybe love would find them both.</i></p><p><i>Sebastian looked at himself in the mirror as he got dressed. He had a white dress shirt with black slacks and blazer. His black tie was perfectly tucked behind the jacket. Slipping on his black dress shoes, Sebastian grabbed his wallet and headed out of the apartment. Walking outside, Chris had pulled up in his Black 2013 Nissan 370Z. Opening the car door, Sebastian just shook his head at his best friend. </i></p><p><i>\u201cNice car. Just bought it?\u201d Sebastian snickered as they sped off through the city of Chicago. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI thought since I got a new job, a new car was in the works. Come on, it\u2019s a nice car. If you ever need to borrow it for a date, you are more than welcome to.\u201d Chris was focused on the road as he drove. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit anxious at this new job. There was going to be a lot expected of them and hopefully, they could handle the task. </i></p><p><i>\u201cEh, right now, I am focused on the job. If I find the right person then it will work itself out, but right now the job will be number one.\u201d Chris nodded his head in agreement with Sebastian\u2019s words but couldn\u2019t help but feel alone at the same time. He just hoped there was someone out there for him as well.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou are right. When we meet the right person, it will just happen.\u201d Chris pulled into the parking lot and took a good look at there new job. It was a huge campus with several different buildings. Different showcases flooded the light poles up high. \u201cLet\u2019s head in and meet the staff.\u201d </i></p><p><i>With that, Sebastian and Chris left the car and made their way towards the college. Sebastian noticed several women were definitely checking them out but none seemed to catch his eye. They were just \u201ceh\u201d to him. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMaybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all,\u201d Chris turned around watching some of the women pass right by him and flashed a pretty boy smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Sebastian laughed as they entered the office building. Just then two gentlemen approached them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou must be our new professors. I want to be the first to welcome you to Colombia. My name is Jack Stevens and I am the President of Colombia.\u201d Jack extended his hand out to shake there hands. \u201cI also would like to introduce you to both our deans, this is Dean Kevin Alter and this is assistant Dean Megan Albright\u201d Sebastian and Chris shock both of there hands as well. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have both of you here. I know the students will be looking forward to there new teachers. We do have an assembly in a few moments, so how about we take you there and then go around the campus.\u201d Dean Kevin suggested.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOf course, lead the way,\u201d Chris said following in Kevin\u2019s direction. Sebastian turned his attention to Megan who was definitely checking him out by the flirty eyes she was giving him.</i></p><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Sebastian. Where did you move from?\u201d Megan asked with a smile on her face. </i></p><p><i>\u201cWe both moved from New York about a week ago.\u201d Sebastian was looking around the campus as they walked outside, doing his best to distract himself.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWow, New York. I always wanted to go. Any particular reason why you moved?\u201d Megan looked up at Sebastian and flashed a smile. </i></p><p><i>\u201cMegan, I am sure that\u2019s personal.\u201d Kevin looked over at her and gave her a stern look. Sebastian just focused on walking towards the gym, not listening to what anyone was saying. </i></p><p><i>His mind was elsewhere as his body did the work. The next forty-five minutes were spent in the gym introducing Chris and himself to the school. Most of the woman in the room were dead focused on them. In his mind, this was going to be exactly like New York where most of the female students were trying to get him. This wasn\u2019t the type of woman he wanted. Sebastian wanted someone down to earth, sweet, kind, with a tough side to her. Someone who wasn\u2019t easy and just wanted to get laid by him. Was this girl even around? </i></p><p><i>Once the assembly was over with, Kevin had dismissed Megan back to the office and decided to show them around the campus. Both Chris and Sebastian would be sharing the same office room. Several other important places were also shown including the cafeteria, the library, along with some other professors as well. Next came the rooms they both would be teaching their classes in. The rooms were close to each other only being separated by another classroom in the middle. </i></p><p><i>Both Sebastian and Chris would have two different class of students with one being Monday and Wednesday at 11 am and then Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am being the other. It was slightly different than most colleges but Colombia was a much smaller school than Harvard or Yale. So the student ratio was about half. It honestly didn\u2019t bother him as much because it meant less work to grade. </i></p><p><i>The auditorium was the last place that was shown and the moment Sebastian walked into - he nearly slammed into a post. There on stage was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her brunette hair was pinned up, the curves in all the right places and the way she flowed across the stage. The moment she spun around, Sebastian noticed her smile. The feeling of his heart hammered against his chest and started to feel a bit of sweat form. This had completely caught him off guard. </i></p><p><i>Who was this girl and why was this happening to him? He had to get to know her. What was her name? Who was that guy on stage with her? Did she have a boyfriend? Was she single? So many questions plagued his mind just watching her dance across the stage. But before he could finish watching her dance, they left the auditorium and back to the office. </i></p><p><i><b>Two Hours Later</b></i></p><p><i>Sebastian and Chris had just come out of the office after spending the last two hours finalizing the paperwork. His mind was still on the beautiful girl dancing on stage and wanting to know about her. Doubt started to take over wondering if he would ever see her again. It was a pretty big campus but Dean Kevin had reassured him that in order to graduate there class was a requirement. So, there was that piece of information that brought his mind at ease. Maybe he would see her again, just didn\u2019t know when that would be. </i></p><p><i>\u201cLet\u2019s get some coffee, I don\u2019t know about you but I could see a pick me up,\u201d Chris said bringing Sebastian out of his thoughts that plagued his mind. Nodding in agreement, he followed in the direction of the small coffee shop that was nearby. </i></p><p><i>Just as they were both walking in line a brunette and a man with dark hair walked in front of them taking their place in line. Both of them got in line behind them as Sebastian\u2019s mind was elsewhere. Chris watched looked over at his best friend and could see something was plaguing his mind.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Chris nudged him causing Sebastian to give him the stink eye. \u201cYou have been awfully quiet these past few hours.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI am perfectly fine. There is just a lot that needs to be done and figuring it out.\u201d Sebastian focused on the female in front of him and noticed that she looked familiar. </i></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</i></p><p><i>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you Tegan, but this is going to be the best four years of our life. We are going to dance our best selves and maybe find someone special.\u201d Travis nudged her causing her to smile. They both had been on a high since they left the auditorium. Just the sheer thought of them dancing in front of crowds and making people smile. It was the one thing they both wanted to do. This was their passion. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYes it will be but I think I will let the finding someone special take a backseat. I just want to focus on us. We are going to be partners after all right, T\u201d Tegan smiled over her new best friend. From the moment they met, it was an instant friendship and Tegan couldn\u2019t have been happier. </i></p><p><i>\u201cT, I like that as a nickname. What about you T?\u201d Travis laughed as they moved up in the line. </i></p><p><i>\u201cI kinda like that as a nickname too.\u201d Both of them couldn\u2019t stop laughing causing a few people to stare at them.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat can I get you miss?\u201d the barista asked </i></p><p><i>\u201cA hot chocolate with peppermint and no whip cream,\u201d Tegan said looking at the muffins as well and realized that they hadn\u2019t even eaten yet. \u201cOh and a banana muffin.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cFor you sir?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cA hot chocolate and a blueberry muffin,\u201d Travis said looking at the muffins as well as his own stomach growled. </i></p><p><i>\u201cName for the order?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cTegan Mitchell.\u201d Travis pulled out his wallet to hand Tegan some money but stopped him. \u201cMy treat.\u201d Tegan handed the barista the money and stood to the side.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNext one is on me.\u201d Travis turned around facing the outside of the small shop and noticed that someone was checking Tegan out. His eyes were only focused on her and couldn\u2019t deny that the guy was pretty handsome. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but there is a guy completely checking you out.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Tegan turned her head slightly and saw that indeed there was a guy checking her out. \u00a0That wasn\u2019t the only catching her eye as several women behind them were also checking out the guy as they giggled. Tegan couldn\u2019t deny that he was attractive with his chiseled jaw, blue eyes and pretty boy smile. This was definitely the type of guy that would just break her heart and not even care. </i></p><p><i>\u201cname for the order.\u201d </i></p><p><i>That\u2019s when Tegan heard his name - Sebastian. Turning her attention back towards Travis who was holding her hot chocolate and muffin in his hand with a smirk. Tegan took both of them and gave him a small smile as Travis was trying to hold in the snicker.</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tegan asked as they walked out of the coffee shop.</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh, nothing. Just there is a completely hot guy checking you out and you are ignoring it. It\u2019s adorable.\u201d Travis looked over at Tegan and could see that there were a few tears coming down her cheek. \u201cI am sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Just something from my past that I haven\u2019t been able to let go. How about we go find somewhere to sit and eat. Maybe tell you the story?\u201d Tegan suggested as they started to walk off campus and saw a small park nearby. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d \u00a0Travis said as they found a bench and settled down on the seat.</i></p><p><i>\u201cit\u2019s okay, I think I need to get this off my chest.\u201d Tegan took a deep breath and started to tell Travis the story of the events. There was no way she would ever fall for that pretty boy type ever again. They were nothing but bad news.</i></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</i></p><p><i>Lord, she was even beautiful up close with the small freckles on her cheeks, her short little frame as he was more than a foot taller than her, there were a sparkle in her eyes and a glow behind her smile. That\u2019s when Sebastian heard her first name \u201cTegan\u201d which meant \u201cdarling\u201d, \u201cloved one\u201d and \u201cfavourite\u201d which fitted her so perfectly. His only attention was on listening to what she was saying - the guy\u2019s name was Travis, ordered a peppermint hot chocolate without any whip cream which meant she probably wasn\u2019t into sweets that much and a banana muffin to resemble some sort of healthiness. That\u2019s when he heard her last name \u201cMitchell\u201d - \u201cTegan Mitchell\u201d.</i></p><p><i>Chris could see that his best friend was staring at a girl in front of him. It was the same girl who was dancing on stage in the auditorium. Sebastian had the same look there that he did right now looking at her. Turning his attention to the barista to his order than turned his attention to Sebastian who was elsewhere. </i></p><p><i>\u201cSebastian?\u201d Chris poked him in the arm bring him back to reality. Sebastian turned his attention to the barista and gave his order. \u201cJust a black coffee.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cName for the order.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSebastian\u201d Sebastian answered and turned back around to see Tegan had left with Travis as they walked outside. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a piece of him was missing the moment she left. The fact he didn\u2019t know this girl at all and simply by her leaving had left him empty inside? What in the world was happening and why was he feeling like this? Taking his coffee, they walked out in the cool September air and headed towards there car. </i></p><p><i>Maybe the move to Chicago wasn\u2019t going to be bad after all. </i></p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>That day still played in his head as the car drove through the city. That this girl had been in his dreams for four years. Four very long years. In that time, his feelings only grew stronger and stronger. He was desperately trying to figure it all out but still came up with no answer as to why Tegan had this effect on him. </p><p>That one day, Sebastian would ask her out on a date and show her the world. A new sense of determination took over inside of him now. Fate wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to flash her in front of him not for them to get together. Whatever the reason for Tegan, he just hoped to figure it out soon. </p><p>\u201cSir, we are here.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s attention turned towards the taxi driver as it arrived at Chris house. Handing him the money, Sebastian exited the taxi and walked up to the house. The beating of his heart thumped against his chest as he walked up to the door. Lightly knocking on the door, he waited for someone to answer the door.</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u201cSebastian, what are you doing here? It\u2019s late.\u201d Chris said looking at his best friend standing in his doorway at 11p at night.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d Sebastian walked right into the house and stopped dead as to who was in the living room. </p><p>\u201cJust come right in.\u201d Chris rolled his eyes and closed the door. \u201cNot here.\u201d Chris lead Sebastian out of the living room and to the backyard. </p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d Sebastian turned around and looked at Chris who was closing the sliding glass door.</p><p>\u201cJay was helping me load stuff out of Tegan\u2019s apartment. It was getting late and Daphne had him stay for dinner. I honestly don\u2019t see how any of this is your business. You aren\u2019t dating Tegan, Sebastian. Another thing, if you saw that place Tegan was staying in you would understand. Tegan is going to be staying here but of course, you already knew that. It isn\u2019t Jay\u2019s fault Tegan got hurt. Her neighbors moved into the apartment next to her and were planning on kidnapping her to use as a sex slave. We haven\u2019t told Tegan any of this because honestly, she doesn\u2019t need to know that. </p><p>But I am so sick and tired of YOU blaming Jay. Tegan and Jay are together right now. You are just going to have to get used to that. If you don\u2019t like it then there\u2019s the door\u201d Chris pointed towards the back door and continued on, \u201cI am not going to keep tolerating this from you. You are my best friend in the world but Tegan is family. I won\u2019t have you upsetting her, getting the way of her relationship, filling her head with lies or hurting her. Is any of this even registering with you?\u201d Chris stared at Sebastian who was focused on something else. Maybe he was trying to process this information or maybe figuring out what to say. The complete blank facial expression on Sebastian\u2019s face didn\u2019t sit too well with Chris. \u201cSEBASTIAN!\u201d</p><p>Sebastian turned his attention towards Chris was looking at him seriously. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was actually hearing. That someone so evil wanted to use Tegan like that. Just the pure thought of it made his blood boil. He was thankful for Jay getting the person responsible for hurting Tegan but it didn\u2019t stop him from disliking the guy. THAT was always going to remain no matter what as long as Jay was with Tegan. </p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d Chris was way beyond annoyed now. His best friend wasn\u2019t even listening to him which annoyed him even more. </p><p>\u201cChris, I am sorry for being an ass. We all know that I can be a huge asshole and I am sorry. You are completely right and I shouldn\u2019t have jumped to conclusions regarding Jay. Tegan is allowed to date anyone that she wants and I have no say otherwise. \u201d Sebastian took a seat on one of the chairs and watched Chris followed suit himself. \u201cI am not going to deny or pretend that I don\u2019t have feelings for Tegan. I do, but I am not going to interfere with them. If it\u2019s meant to be then it will happen.\u201d Sebastian looked up at the stars and saw there was a meteor that went across the sky. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Sebastian made a small wish on that night with the meteor in the sky. <i>\u201cJust let Tegan see me.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cWould either of you like a beer?\u201d Daphne made her way towards the two of them sitting on the porch.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Daphne.\u201d Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne. \u201cLook Daph, I know I am not your favorite person right now and I fucked up a lot. I am sorry for being an ass at the hospital and in general. I shouldn\u2019t have acted that way at all. Tegan is allowed to date who she wants too as long as she is happy that is all that matters. I just have to accept it.\u201d Sebastian looked down at his hands and wish there was a cigarette here to ease this anxiety he was feeling right now. Feeling a hand on his shoulder, Sebastian looked up and saw it was Daphne.</p><p>\u201cLook Seb, I know you have feelings for Tegan. I have known for three years, mind you, but Tegan is with Jay. I am not going to lie, I like Jay. I think he\u2019s good for her especially after what happened in high school. If it\u2019s meant to be, things will work out the way they are supposed to but until then, there is nothing wrong with being her friend. That\u2019s how it happened with us too. I was dating some douchebag asshole named Marcus who I later found out was cheating on me. The day after we broke up, Chris came over with flowers and a bottle of wine. We stayed up all night by the fire and just talked to one another. One thing led to another and Chris kissed me that night. I realized that breaking up with Marcus was the best thing ever because I realized that I was in love with Chris.\u201d Daphne had walked over towards Chris and took a seat on his lap. She placed a small kiss on his lips and then rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI think what Daphne is trying to say is - friendship is the best base for a relationship. Spend time with her and get to know her as a FRIEND. Let her get to know you as well. Just don\u2019t be a slick and kiss her when she\u2019s dating Jay. Let it naturally just happened. I understand that you have feelings for her. I have known since the first day we saw her in the auditorium and in the coffee shop.\u201d Chris was doing his best not to laugh as he continued, \u201cLord knows you just kept staring at her the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Daphne started to laugh as she looked over at Sebastian. </p><p>\u201cYes, laugh it up at my expense.\u201d Sebastian just rolled his eyes as both of them were now making fun of him. If he knew they would be laughing at him, he would have never come over in the first place. </p><p>\u201cI mean it was adorable sweetie.\u201d Chris\u2019 attention was now on Daphne then looked over at Sebastian. \u201cHe was kind of star-struck.\u201d Daphne looked over at Sebastian who wasn\u2019t even paying attention to the conversation at this point. </p><p>\u201cHey, Seb?\u201d Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne who looking at him. \u201cWe forgive you. Just don\u2019t do anything to mess up Tegan\u2019s relationship and just be friends with her. That\u2019s what she needs.\u201d Daphne could still see it was eating him up inside but Tegan\u2019s happiness was more important than anything. </p><p>Sebastian just looked up at the stars and watched as the meteors light up the night sky. He secretly wished that Tegan was laying here with him to watch it. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was fate or his wish was coming true but Sebastian turned his head towards the sliding glass door which had opened. His heart was now hammering in his chest at the sight walking towards him.</p><p>There in front of him was Tegan with a small smile on her face. </p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: </b>\u00a0<a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzhZCk1C1501DeGVnvo77ow\">@moonriv-err</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

Should he go over to Chris&rsquo; house or not? Would it even be a good time? Hell, he didn&rsquo;t even know if Jay was over there now that Tegan was living there. Lord, he didn&rsquo;t want to see that smug douchebag with Tegan. His stomach started to curl just by the sheer thought of the two of them. Did it outweigh that Sebastian hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Chris in almost two weeks? No, it didn&rsquo;t. Sebastian knew after what happened at the hospital, it left his relationship with his best friend on thin ice. Chris nor Daphne were speaking to him right now and it made him feel alone.</p><p>They were his best friends in the world and people he turned for advice or problems. It didn&rsquo;t justify that he honestly thought it was Jay&rsquo;s fault for Tegan getting hurt. Excuse him for actually standing up for Tegan knowing she couldn&rsquo;t do it herself. It made his stomach sick seeing Tegan in crutches and bullet wound in her leg. This was her senior year after all and the recital meant the world to her. Now, it was partially put on hold because of the injury. </p><p>Opening the refrigerator, he saw the bottle of Vodka that still remained in there. Lord, he wanted a drink or a cigarette to calm his nerves but it had been almost a month since he stopped. Sebastian took the bottle out of the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. Opening the junk drawer, he saw a pack of cigarettes that still remained. Back and forth in Sebastian&rsquo;s head to have one or not. </p><p>Sebastian took the bottle and threw it against the wall hearing it shatter on the floor. It was a pure and simple distraction for him. It would never solve his problem and would only make it worse. Sinking deeper and deeper with the possibility of never getting out. He couldn&rsquo;t risk it now, not with so much progress that was already achieved. Taking the cigarettes, Sebastian went to the bathroom and threw them down the toilet. This wasn&rsquo;t going to set him back. </p><p>Looking in the mirror, he could see the dark circles that remained underneath his eyes. The few gray hairs that remained in his beard signifying that he wasn&rsquo;t getting any younger and yet settled down. Almost as if time was running out for him to find someone and to just be happy. Maybe one day that would happen but until then, it was best to work on himself. </p><p>Sebastian took one last look at himself and realized that he needed to fix this. He needed to talk to Chris and or Daphne. Apologize and make it right. Leaving the bathroom, Sebastian grabbed his leather jacket, keys, wallet and left the apartment. The cold air hit in his lungs the moment he stepped outside. Hailing a taxi, Sebastian was on his way to his best friend&rsquo;s house to hopefully make it right.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>As the taxi drove through the streets of Chicago, Sebastian couldn&rsquo;t help but remember the first time he saw Tegan dance. It was almost like love at first sight. The look of happiness radiated off her as she moved across the stage. The world just seemed to fade in his eyes as the attention was only on her. </p><p><i><b>Three Years ago - Fall Semester.</b></i><br /></p><p><i>Sebastian had just moved down to Chicago from New York. It was the start of a new life for him. Not like he was leaving anything behind besides painful memories of a life that once was there. He had found a nice apartment overlooking Lake Michigan, a newly appointed title of a History Professor at Colombia and a new start of life. At the same time, Chris was also appointed as a History Professor and moved with Sebastian. This was the perfect time to start a new life, maybe love would find them both.</i></p><p><i>Sebastian looked at himself in the mirror as he got dressed. He had a white dress shirt with black slacks and blazer. His black tie was perfectly tucked behind the jacket. Slipping on his black dress shoes, Sebastian grabbed his wallet and headed out of the apartment. Walking outside, Chris had pulled up in his Black 2013 Nissan 370Z. Opening the car door, Sebastian just shook his head at his best friend. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Nice car. Just bought it?&rdquo; Sebastian snickered as they sped off through the city of Chicago. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I thought since I got a new job, a new car was in the works. Come on, it&rsquo;s a nice car. If you ever need to borrow it for a date, you are more than welcome to.&rdquo; Chris was focused on the road as he drove. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit anxious at this new job. There was going to be a lot expected of them and hopefully, they could handle the task. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Eh, right now, I am focused on the job. If I find the right person then it will work itself out, but right now the job will be number one.&rdquo; Chris nodded his head in agreement with Sebastian&rsquo;s words but couldn&rsquo;t help but feel alone at the same time. He just hoped there was someone out there for him as well.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are right. When we meet the right person, it will just happen.&rdquo; Chris pulled into the parking lot and took a good look at there new job. It was a huge campus with several different buildings. Different showcases flooded the light poles up high. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head in and meet the staff.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>With that, Sebastian and Chris left the car and made their way towards the college. Sebastian noticed several women were definitely checking them out but none seemed to catch his eye. They were just &ldquo;eh&rdquo; to him. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Maybe this won&rsquo;t be so bad after all,&rdquo; Chris turned around watching some of the women pass right by him and flashed a pretty boy smile. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo; Sebastian laughed as they entered the office building. Just then two gentlemen approached them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You must be our new professors. I want to be the first to welcome you to Colombia. My name is Jack Stevens and I am the President of Colombia.&rdquo; Jack extended his hand out to shake there hands. &ldquo;I also would like to introduce you to both our deans, this is Dean Kevin Alter and this is assistant Dean Megan Albright&rdquo; Sebastian and Chris shock both of there hands as well. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have both of you here. I know the students will be looking forward to there new teachers. We do have an assembly in a few moments, so how about we take you there and then go around the campus.&rdquo; Dean Kevin suggested.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Of course, lead the way,&rdquo; Chris said following in Kevin&rsquo;s direction. Sebastian turned his attention to Megan who was definitely checking him out by the flirty eyes she was giving him.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, Sebastian. Where did you move from?&rdquo; Megan asked with a smile on her face. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;We both moved from New York about a week ago.&rdquo; Sebastian was looking around the campus as they walked outside, doing his best to distract himself.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Wow, New York. I always wanted to go. Any particular reason why you moved?&rdquo; Megan looked up at Sebastian and flashed a smile. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Megan, I am sure that&rsquo;s personal.&rdquo; Kevin looked over at her and gave her a stern look. Sebastian just focused on walking towards the gym, not listening to what anyone was saying. </i></p><p><i>His mind was elsewhere as his body did the work. The next forty-five minutes were spent in the gym introducing Chris and himself to the school. Most of the woman in the room were dead focused on them. In his mind, this was going to be exactly like New York where most of the female students were trying to get him. This wasn&rsquo;t the type of woman he wanted. Sebastian wanted someone down to earth, sweet, kind, with a tough side to her. Someone who wasn&rsquo;t easy and just wanted to get laid by him. Was this girl even around? </i></p><p><i>Once the assembly was over with, Kevin had dismissed Megan back to the office and decided to show them around the campus. Both Chris and Sebastian would be sharing the same office room. Several other important places were also shown including the cafeteria, the library, along with some other professors as well. Next came the rooms they both would be teaching their classes in. The rooms were close to each other only being separated by another classroom in the middle. </i></p><p><i>Both Sebastian and Chris would have two different class of students with one being Monday and Wednesday at 11 am and then Tuesday and Thursday at 9 am being the other. It was slightly different than most colleges but Colombia was a much smaller school than Harvard or Yale. So the student ratio was about half. It honestly didn&rsquo;t bother him as much because it meant less work to grade. </i></p><p><i>The auditorium was the last place that was shown and the moment Sebastian walked into - he nearly slammed into a post. There on stage was the most beautiful woman in the world. Her brunette hair was pinned up, the curves in all the right places and the way she flowed across the stage. The moment she spun around, Sebastian noticed her smile. The feeling of his heart hammered against his chest and started to feel a bit of sweat form. This had completely caught him off guard. </i></p><p><i>Who was this girl and why was this happening to him? He had to get to know her. What was her name? Who was that guy on stage with her? Did she have a boyfriend? Was she single? So many questions plagued his mind just watching her dance across the stage. But before he could finish watching her dance, they left the auditorium and back to the office. </i></p><p><i><b>Two Hours Later</b></i></p><p><i>Sebastian and Chris had just come out of the office after spending the last two hours finalizing the paperwork. His mind was still on the beautiful girl dancing on stage and wanting to know about her. Doubt started to take over wondering if he would ever see her again. It was a pretty big campus but Dean Kevin had reassured him that in order to graduate there class was a requirement. So, there was that piece of information that brought his mind at ease. Maybe he would see her again, just didn&rsquo;t know when that would be. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get some coffee, I don&rsquo;t know about you but I could see a pick me up,&rdquo; Chris said bringing Sebastian out of his thoughts that plagued his mind. Nodding in agreement, he followed in the direction of the small coffee shop that was nearby. </i></p><p><i>Just as they were both walking in line a brunette and a man with dark hair walked in front of them taking their place in line. Both of them got in line behind them as Sebastian&rsquo;s mind was elsewhere. Chris watched looked over at his best friend and could see something was plaguing his mind.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo; Chris nudged him causing Sebastian to give him the stink eye. &ldquo;You have been awfully quiet these past few hours.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I am perfectly fine. There is just a lot that needs to be done and figuring it out.&rdquo; Sebastian focused on the female in front of him and noticed that she looked familiar. </i></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about you Tegan, but this is going to be the best four years of our life. We are going to dance our best selves and maybe find someone special.&rdquo; Travis nudged her causing her to smile. They both had been on a high since they left the auditorium. Just the sheer thought of them dancing in front of crowds and making people smile. It was the one thing they both wanted to do. This was their passion. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes it will be but I think I will let the finding someone special take a backseat. I just want to focus on us. We are going to be partners after all right, T&rdquo; Tegan smiled over her new best friend. From the moment they met, it was an instant friendship and Tegan couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;T, I like that as a nickname. What about you T?&rdquo; Travis laughed as they moved up in the line. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I kinda like that as a nickname too.&rdquo; Both of them couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing causing a few people to stare at them.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What can I get you miss?&rdquo; the barista asked </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A hot chocolate with peppermint and no whip cream,&rdquo; Tegan said looking at the muffins as well and realized that they hadn&rsquo;t even eaten yet. &ldquo;Oh and a banana muffin.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;For you sir?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A hot chocolate and a blueberry muffin,&rdquo; Travis said looking at the muffins as well as his own stomach growled. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Name for the order?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Tegan Mitchell.&rdquo; Travis pulled out his wallet to hand Tegan some money but stopped him. &ldquo;My treat.&rdquo; Tegan handed the barista the money and stood to the side.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Next one is on me.&rdquo; Travis turned around facing the outside of the small shop and noticed that someone was checking Tegan out. His eyes were only focused on her and couldn&rsquo;t deny that the guy was pretty handsome. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look now, but there is a guy completely checking you out.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Tegan turned her head slightly and saw that indeed there was a guy checking her out. &nbsp;That wasn&rsquo;t the only catching her eye as several women behind them were also checking out the guy as they giggled. Tegan couldn&rsquo;t deny that he was attractive with his chiseled jaw, blue eyes and pretty boy smile. This was definitely the type of guy that would just break her heart and not even care. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;name for the order.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s when Tegan heard his name - Sebastian. Turning her attention back towards Travis who was holding her hot chocolate and muffin in his hand with a smirk. Tegan took both of them and gave him a small smile as Travis was trying to hold in the snicker.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tegan asked as they walked out of the coffee shop.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Just there is a completely hot guy checking you out and you are ignoring it. It&rsquo;s adorable.&rdquo; Travis looked over at Tegan and could see that there were a few tears coming down her cheek. &ldquo;I am sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay. Just something from my past that I haven&rsquo;t been able to let go. How about we go find somewhere to sit and eat. Maybe tell you the story?&rdquo; Tegan suggested as they started to walk off campus and saw a small park nearby. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; &nbsp;Travis said as they found a bench and settled down on the seat.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, I think I need to get this off my chest.&rdquo; Tegan took a deep breath and started to tell Travis the story of the events. There was no way she would ever fall for that pretty boy type ever again. They were nothing but bad news.</i></p><p><i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i></p><p><i>Lord, she was even beautiful up close with the small freckles on her cheeks, her short little frame as he was more than a foot taller than her, there were a sparkle in her eyes and a glow behind her smile. That&rsquo;s when Sebastian heard her first name &ldquo;Tegan&rdquo; which meant &ldquo;darling&rdquo;, &ldquo;loved one&rdquo; and &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; which fitted her so perfectly. His only attention was on listening to what she was saying - the guy&rsquo;s name was Travis, ordered a peppermint hot chocolate without any whip cream which meant she probably wasn&rsquo;t into sweets that much and a banana muffin to resemble some sort of healthiness. That&rsquo;s when he heard her last name &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; - &ldquo;Tegan Mitchell&rdquo;.</i></p><p><i>Chris could see that his best friend was staring at a girl in front of him. It was the same girl who was dancing on stage in the auditorium. Sebastian had the same look there that he did right now looking at her. Turning his attention to the barista to his order than turned his attention to Sebastian who was elsewhere. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sebastian?&rdquo; Chris poked him in the arm bring him back to reality. Sebastian turned his attention to the barista and gave his order. &ldquo;Just a black coffee.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Name for the order.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sebastian&rdquo; Sebastian answered and turned back around to see Tegan had left with Travis as they walked outside. He couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a piece of him was missing the moment she left. The fact he didn&rsquo;t know this girl at all and simply by her leaving had left him empty inside? What in the world was happening and why was he feeling like this? Taking his coffee, they walked out in the cool September air and headed towards there car. </i></p><p><i>Maybe the move to Chicago wasn&rsquo;t going to be bad after all. </i></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>That day still played in his head as the car drove through the city. That this girl had been in his dreams for four years. Four very long years. In that time, his feelings only grew stronger and stronger. He was desperately trying to figure it all out but still came up with no answer as to why Tegan had this effect on him. </p><p>That one day, Sebastian would ask her out on a date and show her the world. A new sense of determination took over inside of him now. Fate wouldn&rsquo;t be so cruel as to flash her in front of him not for them to get together. Whatever the reason for Tegan, he just hoped to figure it out soon. </p><p>&ldquo;Sir, we are here.&rdquo; Sebastian&rsquo;s attention turned towards the taxi driver as it arrived at Chris house. Handing him the money, Sebastian exited the taxi and walked up to the house. The beating of his heart thumped against his chest as he walked up to the door. Lightly knocking on the door, he waited for someone to answer the door.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sebastian, what are you doing here? It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo; Chris said looking at his best friend standing in his doorway at 11p at night.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to talk to you.&rdquo; Sebastian walked right into the house and stopped dead as to who was in the living room. </p><p>&ldquo;Just come right in.&rdquo; Chris rolled his eyes and closed the door. &ldquo;Not here.&rdquo; Chris lead Sebastian out of the living room and to the backyard. </p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is he doing here?&rdquo; Sebastian turned around and looked at Chris who was closing the sliding glass door.</p><p>&ldquo;Jay was helping me load stuff out of Tegan&rsquo;s apartment. It was getting late and Daphne had him stay for dinner. I honestly don&rsquo;t see how any of this is your business. You aren&rsquo;t dating Tegan, Sebastian. Another thing, if you saw that place Tegan was staying in you would understand. Tegan is going to be staying here but of course, you already knew that. It isn&rsquo;t Jay&rsquo;s fault Tegan got hurt. Her neighbors moved into the apartment next to her and were planning on kidnapping her to use as a sex slave. We haven&rsquo;t told Tegan any of this because honestly, she doesn&rsquo;t need to know that. </p><p>But I am so sick and tired of YOU blaming Jay. Tegan and Jay are together right now. You are just going to have to get used to that. If you don&rsquo;t like it then there&rsquo;s the door&rdquo; Chris pointed towards the back door and continued on, &ldquo;I am not going to keep tolerating this from you. You are my best friend in the world but Tegan is family. I won&rsquo;t have you upsetting her, getting the way of her relationship, filling her head with lies or hurting her. Is any of this even registering with you?&rdquo; Chris stared at Sebastian who was focused on something else. Maybe he was trying to process this information or maybe figuring out what to say. The complete blank facial expression on Sebastian&rsquo;s face didn&rsquo;t sit too well with Chris. &ldquo;SEBASTIAN!&rdquo;</p><p>Sebastian turned his attention towards Chris was looking at him seriously. He couldn&rsquo;t believe what he was actually hearing. That someone so evil wanted to use Tegan like that. Just the pure thought of it made his blood boil. He was thankful for Jay getting the person responsible for hurting Tegan but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from disliking the guy. THAT was always going to remain no matter what as long as Jay was with Tegan. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you even listening to me?&rdquo; Chris was way beyond annoyed now. His best friend wasn&rsquo;t even listening to him which annoyed him even more. </p><p>&ldquo;Chris, I am sorry for being an ass. We all know that I can be a huge asshole and I am sorry. You are completely right and I shouldn&rsquo;t have jumped to conclusions regarding Jay. Tegan is allowed to date anyone that she wants and I have no say otherwise. &rdquo; Sebastian took a seat on one of the chairs and watched Chris followed suit himself. &ldquo;I am not going to deny or pretend that I don&rsquo;t have feelings for Tegan. I do, but I am not going to interfere with them. If it&rsquo;s meant to be then it will happen.&rdquo; Sebastian looked up at the stars and saw there was a meteor that went across the sky. </p><p>Closing his eyes, Sebastian made a small wish on that night with the meteor in the sky. <i>&ldquo;Just let Tegan see me.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Would either of you like a beer?&rdquo; Daphne made her way towards the two of them sitting on the porch.</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Daphne.&rdquo; Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne. &ldquo;Look Daph, I know I am not your favorite person right now and I fucked up a lot. I am sorry for being an ass at the hospital and in general. I shouldn&rsquo;t have acted that way at all. Tegan is allowed to date who she wants too as long as she is happy that is all that matters. I just have to accept it.&rdquo; Sebastian looked down at his hands and wish there was a cigarette here to ease this anxiety he was feeling right now. Feeling a hand on his shoulder, Sebastian looked up and saw it was Daphne.</p><p>&ldquo;Look Seb, I know you have feelings for Tegan. I have known for three years, mind you, but Tegan is with Jay. I am not going to lie, I like Jay. I think he&rsquo;s good for her especially after what happened in high school. If it&rsquo;s meant to be, things will work out the way they are supposed to but until then, there is nothing wrong with being her friend. That&rsquo;s how it happened with us too. I was dating some douchebag asshole named Marcus who I later found out was cheating on me. The day after we broke up, Chris came over with flowers and a bottle of wine. We stayed up all night by the fire and just talked to one another. One thing led to another and Chris kissed me that night. I realized that breaking up with Marcus was the best thing ever because I realized that I was in love with Chris.&rdquo; Daphne had walked over towards Chris and took a seat on his lap. She placed a small kiss on his lips and then rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;I think what Daphne is trying to say is - friendship is the best base for a relationship. Spend time with her and get to know her as a FRIEND. Let her get to know you as well. Just don&rsquo;t be a slick and kiss her when she&rsquo;s dating Jay. Let it naturally just happened. I understand that you have feelings for her. I have known since the first day we saw her in the auditorium and in the coffee shop.&rdquo; Chris was doing his best not to laugh as he continued, &ldquo;Lord knows you just kept staring at her the whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Daphne started to laugh as she looked over at Sebastian. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, laugh it up at my expense.&rdquo; Sebastian just rolled his eyes as both of them were now making fun of him. If he knew they would be laughing at him, he would have never come over in the first place. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean it was adorable sweetie.&rdquo; Chris&rsquo; attention was now on Daphne then looked over at Sebastian. &ldquo;He was kind of star-struck.&rdquo; Daphne looked over at Sebastian who wasn&rsquo;t even paying attention to the conversation at this point. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Seb?&rdquo; Sebastian turned his attention towards Daphne who looking at him. &ldquo;We forgive you. Just don&rsquo;t do anything to mess up Tegan&rsquo;s relationship and just be friends with her. That&rsquo;s what she needs.&rdquo; Daphne could still see it was eating him up inside but Tegan&rsquo;s happiness was more important than anything. </p><p>Sebastian just looked up at the stars and watched as the meteors light up the night sky. He secretly wished that Tegan was laying here with him to watch it. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was fate or his wish was coming true but Sebastian turned his head towards the sliding glass door which had opened. His heart was now hammering in his chest at the sight walking towards him.</p><p>There in front of him was Tegan with a small smile on her face. </p><p><b>Do You See Me Taglist: </b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mW5ssh_HpQSSs4kyjRhe9vA\">@hehurst23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSQ8RXPV_K5CBpeHj6cPsw\">@fangirlfiction</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPeJwFWMRmS8pvLzN_lQAWA\">@writing-in-the-impala</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mK5sYAuxIuAF6WSSFLdXNhw\">@emercat</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mARSIftlXw_99S9YvPIZ3MQ\">@cootie06</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muqRvbe0mEj95uNt_yVzXuw\">@kyber-hearts-and-stardust-souls</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTrt1frH3lYtqeYiaqMLhiA\">@lovejessejay</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mM3UeVBrk2zdM_9tQRO8Cog\">@canumoveurseatup-no</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrg5dyIjtxkXJkfauPnLA6w\">@all1e23</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3oVXVm_CJfrBWJsvf7wX4Q\">@buckmesideways22</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mzhZCk1C1501DeGVnvo77ow\">@moonriv-err</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDBZ6G6dGwaeFSodTIVmV-A\">@cap-evanns</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mklkZ0WDDCgHBRbTDgg_EfA\">@cmorgana</a> // <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mA4_8wswWZ_qSkEMMQ_5V0w\">@givebuckyhisplum</a> </p>",

Should he go over to Chris&rsquo; house or not? Would it even be a good time? Hell, he didn&rsquo;t even know if Jay was over there now that Tegan was living there. Lord, he didn&rsquo;t want to see that smug douchebag with Tegan. His stomach started to curl just by the sheer thought of the two of them. Did it outweigh that Sebastian hadn&rsquo;t spoken to Chris in almost two weeks? No, it didn&rsquo;t. Sebastian knew after what happened at the hospital, it left his relationship with his best friend on thin ice. Chris nor Daphne were speaking to him right now and it made him feel alone.</p>\n<p>They were his best friends in the world and people he turned for advice or problems. It didn&rsquo;t justify that he honestly thought it was Jay&rsquo;s fault for Tegan getting hurt. Excuse him for actually standing up for Tegan knowing she couldn&rsquo;t do it herself. It made his stomach sick seeing Tegan in crutches and bullet wound in her leg. This was her senior year after all and the recital meant the world to her. Now, it was partially put on hold because of the injury. </p>\n<p>Opening the refrigerator, he saw the bottle of Vodka that still remained in there. Lord, he wanted a drink or a cigarette to calm his nerves but it had been almost a month since he stopped. Sebastian took the bottle out of the refrigerator and placed it on the counter. Opening the junk drawer, he saw a pack of cigarettes that still remained. Back and forth in Sebastian&rsquo;s head to have one or not. </p>\n</p>",

It was relaxing. Monotonous movements bringing the slightest peace to her roaming mind.</p><p>\u201cHe was nice.\u201d She said, thinking about the man she set with less than two hours ago. Blond, blue eyes, not entirely dissimilar from the one below her. \u201cI think he wants a second date.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s chest tensed in a nearly subtle flex she wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was aware of, \u201cdo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d Y/n knew he wouldn\u2019t admit it, but the sudden way the air settled in his lungs under her resting head told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If he\u2019s nice, and likes you\u2026Why not?\u201d</p><p>Y/n thought back to the second her date brought her home; they kissed. She felt the taste of the beer he drank on his tongue, devouring her passionately. His teeth sank in her bottom lip as he brushed their noses together, saying he wants to see her tomorrow. One hand laid gently on her neck and the other shuffled between clutching her waist and massaging her right breast through her blouse. Her own hands never left her lap.</p><p>She thought back to the desperate way she texted Steve, didn\u2019t even let her keys stop their jingling, didn\u2019t stop to let her blush fade away from her cheeks. She only left him one message, <i>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</i></p><p>An hour and a half later, there they were. Naked in Steve\u2019s bed, covered in dried sweat, avoiding words they know they shouldn\u2019t say - or perhaps, should. Talking about a stupid date she thought would mean something. Would help somehow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Steve. Something about his energy, I- I don\u2019t know, I was a bit uncomfortable, I guess. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed, rich vocabulary not disclosing much. She stared at her hand on his smooth chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first date, doll, it\u2019s supposed to be uncomfortable.\u201d Steve vibrated with laugh under her, breathy and with the tiniest hint of patronizing. It pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you\u2019ve been on plenty, I\u2019m sure. Besides, I don\u2019t like being uncomfortable.\u201d She shifted, trying to roll off him as the hand on her bottom tightened, holding her secure in place. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, y/n, m\u2019sorry.\u201d He said, nudging her temple with his chin to get her to look at him, he could sense he said the wrong thing, \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just\u2026you should get out there, you know.\u201d<br/>He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, a comforting smile oh his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d Her sigh had a ton of finality to it, she didn\u2019t want to dwell on the subject, so despite his curiosity, Steve didn\u2019t push.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d He moved up gently, patting her head, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d She stated simply, watching his impressive figure as he left the bed, muscles shift under his skin as he walked swimmingly to his pile of clothes. She could never get used to how perfect he was, every part of him.</p><p>Steve reached for his boxers, pulling them up in a smooth motion, stretching his biceps behind his head.\u00a0<br/>\u201cHe didn\u2019t feed you then?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>Y/n rolled her eyes, wrapping the soft blanket around her as she got up as well, following him to the kitchen, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>She watched him making food for her, fascinated. Back muscles reacting to his movements; curve and flex and change, hips gracefully taking him from one side to another, gathering the products he needed.</p><p> It was well past midnight, New York so uncharacteristically quiet. The lack of noise pulling her deeper into thoughts, her imagination flying as far as the new freedom given to it allowed;</p><p>She could almost imagine them, together. Sitting in the kitchen after a long day at work, talking about each other\u2019s day, so accustomed to living together it\u2019s no longer a source of excitement but comforting and reassuring. Like deep rooted love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want something with your eggs?\u201d Steve asked nonchalantly, his back to her still, ripping her back to reality. Good thing he didn\u2019t see the tears starting to form at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>She blinked them out quickly, adjusting the soft blanket that was still the only thing covering her, \u201cno thanks. Just the eggs is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He said lightly, placing a teal colored plate before her, handing her a fork.</p><p>She nodded at him as he set on the chair in front of her with a teal plate of his own, starting to eat promptly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d She smiled at him, shuffling the food more than eating it. </p><p>He nodded back, mouth stuffed to the point he couldn\u2019t talk. She smiled a little wider. </p><p><br/></p><p>They ate in silence after that, filling the air with the sound of metal on china. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable one, like they often shared; it was charged, air static and unmoving around them, y/n said the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cSo do you have someone? I mean\u2026dating? I mean\u2026you know.\u201d She stumbled over her words, already regretting ever opening her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve remarked, \u201cgod no.\u201d</p><p>Her lips shaped into an adorable pout for a brief moment, turning back into the straight face she had before, failing to hide her obvious dissatisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d She finally said, pushing away the half empty plate.</p><p>\u201cI told you before, y/n. I\u2019m not looking for this, I can\u2019t be. Not just with you, but with anyone. I\u2019m not that guy anymore, I moved on.\u201d His eyes were kind when he looked at her, almost mistaken for pity. He placed his hand on top of hers, voice suddenly softer than before, \u201cso should you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him wide eyed, yanking her hand violently, \u201cme? Moving on?\u201d She scuffed, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to open the door for me every single time, you know. No one is forcing you to undress me every single time I arrive, Steve. Don\u2019t play all innocent on me now, you have faults just as much as me.\u201d</p><p>He was standing up now, towering over her more than usual. Eyes dark but somehow, very calm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026don\u2019t you think I know it\u2019s wrong?\u201d He swallowed, arms to his side, tone still collected, \u201cI hate that I\u2019m leading you on,\u201d she snorted, \u201cI hate it. I really do.\u201d He stepped away from her, grabbing his head in his hands.</p><p>She cleared her throat, speaking almost professionally, \u201cyou made it very clear we are not together, that we cannot be and will never be. I don\u2019t know how naive you think I am, that I don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d She sighed, tears prickling in her eyes again. Damn her and her inability to argue.<br/>\u201cI never should\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>Y/n got up from her chair, pushing it backwards. She fixed the sheet around her again and walked determined to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cY/n, it\u2019s not like that! You\u2026you know it\u2019s not\u2026Dammit.\u201d Steve called after her, easily catching up with quick steps. He grabbed her elbow, more forcefully than he intended and she jerked backwards, dropping the white fabric that covered her.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She muttered, meaning to bend over to pick it up when Steve stopped her; holding her in place with his hand on her chin, tilting it up to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would never be cruel enough to make you be with me.\u201d He whispered, \u201cyou deserve way better y/n. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his beautifully crafted lips, angry red and waiting to be kissed. She bit her own, trying to stop herself from doing something she knew she will.</p><p>The air was buzzing around them again, tension so thick it could be heard. Steve swallowed, eyes fixated on how eager her gaze was on his mouth, suddenly very aware of how naked she was again.</p><p>Her breasts laid soft, hardening nipples erect, raising and falling in a short pace. He could hear her heartbeats from over here. Or was it his own?</p><p>Steve knew it was his fault just as much as it was hers. He could turn her down. He should turn her down; but as her tongue wetted her bottom lip, locking eyes with him, breaking the spell but creating a brand new one, he knew he was gone.</p><p>He took a step closer, inhaling the air she breathed out, looking down to her face, shadow masking half of it, emphasizing the bags under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Steve whispered in defeat, cupping her jaw with both of his hands and pulling her to reach him. </p><p>Y/n stood on her tiptoes, attaching their lips together and bringing her hands up to find his hair. She tugged, inhaling sharply when she felt two strong hands securing themselves around her thighs; Steve hoisted her up in a sleek motion, mouths separating only for a moment before they started kissing again. She took his bottom lips in hers, allowing his tongue to enter.</p><p>He stroked the insides of her cheeks slowly, exploring the already known, making her breathe softly into him, her tongue aching to find his. </p><p>Steve moved them forward, her back to the open door of the room they left not long ago. Y/n was finally able to reach him; tongues almost dancing, for a second in the free air, then back to her mouth, then back to his. </p><p>He sat on the bed still with her in his arms. Her thighs fell to either side of his lap, her bare sex inevitably rubbing against his clothed one, shooting sparks of pleasure up their spines.</p><p>Steve pulled back, holding her face between his large hands; He was literally holding her, yet she was still so out of his reach. <br/>\nHe never really took the time to memorize her features, he realized then- the curve of her eyelashes and the small hairs on her eyebrows and that freckle she had near her nose. </p><p>This face deserved to be cherished, appreciated, by someone better than him. </p><p>He kissed her cheek, staring at her wide eyes, then kissed the edge of her jaw, then her neck, and then behind her ear. She made the most beautiful sound. Only for him. </p><p>\u201c<i>I want you to ride me</i>.\u201d He whispered softly into her ear, instructions sharp and undisputed.</p><p>As she nodded, pupils dilated with lust, he pulled both of them farther into the bed, reaching the cushy river of pillows covered in twisted peach colored sheets, evidence of their last actions earlier. </p><p>Steve placed himself, head leaned again the wooden headboard, creating the perfect view of her. She bent down to kiss the end of his abs, placing a quiet blow on the skin above the black waistband of his boxers. Her nose brushed against the bright trail of hairs decorating his stomach, disappearing under the dark fabric that grew larger every second.</p><p>Y/n pushed down his underwear, revealing his hard cock. Perfect and incredibly big when it hit his stomach. </p><p>Steve groaned, buckling his hips up with impatience, but stopping when she brought one hand to her heat, burying two of her fingers inside and gathering her wetness.</p><p>She moved her palm to his hardening boner, coating it with her juices and pumping him ready.</p><p>When a bit of precum emerged from the tip of him, long vein pulsing and throbbing, she raised her hips up, placing him directly at her entrance. Steve moaned, guiding himself farther between her folds and sliding inside her slowly. The size of him stretching her in the most welcomed way.\u00a0</p><p>Even when it hurt more than pleased, she still loved the feeling of him inside her; So intimate and irreplaceable, the sound of skin on skin. His motions in her, painfully slow and sensible, each movement defined against her walls.</p><p>He was perfect. And she was ruined.<br/>She was ruined because she didn\u2019t think she could ever love someone like she loves him.</p><p>Y/n gripped his bicep, clinging for balance as he thrusted particularly hard, his hands supporting her waist.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d She moaned, trying to speed up against him, rolling her hips in an increasing pace. </p><p>\u201cShh, baby doll. I want to take it slow, okay?\u201d She whined, nodding reluctantly as he steadied her, every thrust long and meaningful, like it was the last time.<br/><i>Maybe it was.</i></p><p>Her eyes rolled back in pleasure, Steve filling her up perfectly, her breasts bounced softly with every movement of him, desperate for attention. </p><p><br/></p><p>The light huffs and bids of sweat forming on her forehead were telling Steve she was close. Y/n collapsed on top of him as her last measure, needy for more friction and speed to get to her high.</p><p>She was laying on top of him, lower waist secured by his hands as he began to slam into her, rocking her whole body against him as he went relentlessly, promises of taking it slow long forgotten. Pounding deeper and faster with how urgent his name fell from her lips, desperate and dripping wanton. </p><p>She buried her face in his chest, letting him do as he pleased, knowing he can take care of her. </p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m, I\u2019m coming-\u201c She came with a loud cry, her hand trapped between their bodies, two fingers rubbing her clit rapidly, riding her orgasm and clutching her walls around him. </p><p>His cock was twitching inside her, and she raised her head to look at him; eyebrows furrowed in concentration, bottom lip between his teeth capturing a shade so deep she thought was inhumanly possible, sharp cheekbones softened by splatters of rosy blush. </p><p>Steve opened his previously shut eyes, sensing the linger of her gaze on his face as he fucked into her still, enhancing her bliss while chasing his own.</p><p>She kissed the pulsing vain on his neck and the freckle on his shoulder, listening to his moans gradually becoming more desperate, his thrusts less controlled. </p><p>\u201cI want to feel you come Steve.\u201d Y/n hummed lazily in his ear, holding herself higher on his chest, clenching around him with the little strength she had left.</p><p>Steve inhaled sharply, groaning and muttering hushed curses under his breath, releasing loads of warm cum inside her, chipped nails sunken in her smooth back.</p><p>She brought her fingers up from her sensitive clit, laughing at Steve\u2019s frown as she cleaned them with the sheets, bringing her arms back to his chest.</p><p>He kissed her sweaty temple, sliding out of her along with his cum - white streak of liquid dripping out of her hole, slowly finding its way down her thigh.</p><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d She said tiredly, embracing his shoulder and forcing him to stay down when he tried to clean her up, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Steve bit the inside of his cheek and smirked, holding her closer instead.</p><p>-</p><p>He woke up just when the first rays of sun emerged from the night. Skies dark, still, but now in shades of orange and blue instead of black. Biological clock doing his work.</p><p>There was no note. Not even a text. If it wasn\u2019t for the aching boner, coated with juices that weren\u2019t his - he would\u2019ve thought it was all a dream.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201c<i>Twenty minutes.

It was relaxing. Monotonous movements bringing the slightest peace to her roaming mind.</p><p>\u201cHe was nice.\u201d She said, thinking about the man she set with less than two hours ago. Blond, blue eyes, not entirely dissimilar from the one below her. \u201cI think he wants a second date.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s chest tensed in a nearly subtle flex she wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was aware of, \u201cdo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d Y/n knew he wouldn\u2019t admit it, but the sudden way the air settled in his lungs under her resting head told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If he\u2019s nice, and likes you\u2026Why not?\u201d</p><p>Y/n thought back to the second her date brought her home; they kissed. She felt the taste of the beer he drank on his tongue, devouring her passionately. His teeth sank in her bottom lip as he brushed their noses together, saying he wants to see her tomorrow. One hand laid gently on her neck and the other shuffled between clutching her waist and massaging her right breast through her blouse. Her own hands never left her lap.</p><p>She thought back to the desperate way she texted Steve, didn\u2019t even let her keys stop their jingling, didn\u2019t stop to let her blush fade away from her cheeks. She only left him one message, <i>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</i></p><p>An hour and a half later, there they were. Naked in Steve\u2019s bed, covered in dried sweat, avoiding words they know they shouldn\u2019t say - or perhaps, should. Talking about a stupid date she thought would mean something. Would help somehow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Steve. Something about his energy, I- I don\u2019t know, I was a bit uncomfortable, I guess. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed, rich vocabulary not disclosing much. She stared at her hand on his smooth chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first date, doll, it\u2019s supposed to be uncomfortable.\u201d Steve vibrated with laugh under her, breathy and with the tiniest hint of patronizing. It pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you\u2019ve been on plenty, I\u2019m sure. Besides, I don\u2019t like being uncomfortable.\u201d She shifted, trying to roll off him as the hand on her bottom tightened, holding her secure in place. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, y/n, m\u2019sorry.\u201d He said, nudging her temple with his chin to get her to look at him, he could sense he said the wrong thing, \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just\u2026you should get out there, you know.\u201d<br>He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, a comforting smile oh his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d Her sigh had a ton of finality to it, she didn\u2019t want to dwell on the subject, so despite his curiosity, Steve didn\u2019t push.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d He moved up gently, patting her head, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d She stated simply, watching his impressive figure as he left the bed, muscles shift under his skin as he walked swimmingly to his pile of clothes. She could never get used to how perfect he was, every part of him.</p><p>Steve reached for his boxers, pulling them up in a smooth motion, stretching his biceps behind his head.\u00a0<br>\u201cHe didn\u2019t feed you then?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>Y/n rolled her eyes, wrapping the soft blanket around her as she got up as well, following him to the kitchen, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>She watched him making food for her, fascinated. Back muscles reacting to his movements; curve and flex and change, hips gracefully taking him from one side to another, gathering the products he needed.</p><p> It was well past midnight, New York so uncharacteristically quiet. The lack of noise pulling her deeper into thoughts, her imagination flying as far as the new freedom given to it allowed;</p><p>She could almost imagine them, together. Sitting in the kitchen after a long day at work, talking about each other\u2019s day, so accustomed to living together it\u2019s no longer a source of excitement but comforting and reassuring. Like deep rooted love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want something with your eggs?\u201d Steve asked nonchalantly, his back to her still, ripping her back to reality. Good thing he didn\u2019t see the tears starting to form at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>She blinked them out quickly, adjusting the soft blanket that was still the only thing covering her, \u201cno thanks. Just the eggs is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He said lightly, placing a teal colored plate before her, handing her a fork.</p><p>She nodded at him as he set on the chair in front of her with a teal plate of his own, starting to eat promptly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d She smiled at him, shuffling the food more than eating it. </p><p>He nodded back, mouth stuffed to the point he couldn\u2019t talk. She smiled a little wider. </p><p><br></p><p>They ate in silence after that, filling the air with the sound of metal on china. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable one, like they often shared; it was charged, air static and unmoving around them, y/n said the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cSo do you have someone? I mean\u2026dating? I mean\u2026you know.\u201d She stumbled over her words, already regretting ever opening her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve remarked, \u201cgod no.\u201d</p><p>Her lips shaped into an adorable pout for a brief moment, turning back into the straight face she had before, failing to hide her obvious dissatisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d She finally said, pushing away the half empty plate.</p><p>\u201cI told you before, y/n. I\u2019m not looking for this, I can\u2019t be. Not just with you, but with anyone. I\u2019m not that guy anymore, I moved on.\u201d His eyes were kind when he looked at her, almost mistaken for pity. He placed his hand on top of hers, voice suddenly softer than before, \u201cso should you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him wide eyed, yanking her hand violently, \u201cme? Moving on?\u201d She scuffed, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to open the door for me every single time, you know. No one is forcing you to undress me every single time I arrive, Steve. Don\u2019t play all innocent on me now, you have faults just as much as me.\u201d</p><p>He was standing up now, towering over her more than usual. Eyes dark but somehow, very calm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026don\u2019t you think I know it\u2019s wrong?\u201d He swallowed, arms to his side, tone still collected, \u201cI hate that I\u2019m leading you on,\u201d she snorted, \u201cI hate it. I really do.\u201d He stepped away from her, grabbing his head in his hands.</p><p>She cleared her throat, speaking almost professionally, \u201cyou made it very clear we are not together, that we cannot be and will never be. I don\u2019t know how naive you think I am, that I don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d She sighed, tears prickling in her eyes again. Damn her and her inability to argue.<br>\u201cI never should\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>Y/n got up from her chair, pushing it backwards. She fixed the sheet around her again and walked determined to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cY/n, it\u2019s not like that! You\u2026you know it\u2019s not\u2026Dammit.\u201d Steve called after her, easily catching up with quick steps. He grabbed her elbow, more forcefully than he intended and she jerked backwards, dropping the white fabric that covered her.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She muttered, meaning to bend over to pick it up when Steve stopped her; holding her in place with his hand on her chin, tilting it up to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would never be cruel enough to make you be with me.\u201d He whispered, \u201cyou deserve way better y/n. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his beautifully crafted lips, angry red and waiting to be kissed. She bit her own, trying to stop herself from doing something she knew she will.</p><p>The air was buzzing around them again, tension so thick it could be heard. Steve swallowed, eyes fixated on how eager her gaze was on his mouth, suddenly very aware of how naked she was again.</p><p>Her breasts laid soft, hardening nipples erect, raising and falling in a short pace.

It was relaxing. Monotonous movements bringing the slightest peace to her roaming mind.</p><p>\u201cHe was nice.\u201d She said, thinking about the man she set with less than two hours ago. Blond, blue eyes, not entirely dissimilar from the one below her. \u201cI think he wants a second date.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s chest tensed in a nearly subtle flex she wasn\u2019t entirely sure he was aware of, \u201cdo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d Y/n knew he wouldn\u2019t admit it, but the sudden way the air settled in his lungs under her resting head told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If he\u2019s nice, and likes you\u2026Why not?\u201d</p><p>Y/n thought back to the second her date brought her home; they kissed. She felt the taste of the beer he drank on his tongue, devouring her passionately. His teeth sank in her bottom lip as he brushed their noses together, saying he wants to see her tomorrow. One hand laid gently on her neck and the other shuffled between clutching her waist and massaging her right breast through her blouse. Her own hands never left her lap.</p><p>She thought back to the desperate way she texted Steve, didn\u2019t even let her keys stop their jingling, didn\u2019t stop to let her blush fade away from her cheeks. She only left him one message, <i>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</i></p><p>An hour and a half later, there they were. Naked in Steve\u2019s bed, covered in dried sweat, avoiding words they know they shouldn\u2019t say - or perhaps, should. Talking about a stupid date she thought would mean something. Would help somehow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Steve. Something about his energy, I- I don\u2019t know, I was a bit uncomfortable, I guess. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She sighed, rich vocabulary not disclosing much. She stared at her hand on his smooth chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first date, doll, it\u2019s supposed to be uncomfortable.\u201d Steve vibrated with laugh under her, breathy and with the tiniest hint of patronizing. It pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you\u2019ve been on plenty, I\u2019m sure. Besides, I don\u2019t like being uncomfortable.\u201d She shifted, trying to roll off him as the hand on her bottom tightened, holding her secure in place. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, y/n, m\u2019sorry.\u201d He said, nudging her temple with his chin to get her to look at him, he could sense he said the wrong thing, \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just\u2026you should get out there, you know.\u201d<br>He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, a comforting smile oh his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know.\u201d Her sigh had a ton of finality to it, she didn\u2019t want to dwell on the subject, so despite his curiosity, Steve didn\u2019t push.</p><p>\u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d He moved up gently, patting her head, \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d She stated simply, watching his impressive figure as he left the bed, muscles shift under his skin as he walked swimmingly to his pile of clothes. She could never get used to how perfect he was, every part of him.</p><p>Steve reached for his boxers, pulling them up in a smooth motion, stretching his biceps behind his head.\u00a0<br>\u201cHe didn\u2019t feed you then?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>Y/n rolled her eyes, wrapping the soft blanket around her as she got up as well, following him to the kitchen, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>She watched him making food for her, fascinated. Back muscles reacting to his movements; curve and flex and change, hips gracefully taking him from one side to another, gathering the products he needed.</p><p> It was well past midnight, New York so uncharacteristically quiet. The lack of noise pulling her deeper into thoughts, her imagination flying as far as the new freedom given to it allowed;</p><p>She could almost imagine them, together. Sitting in the kitchen after a long day at work, talking about each other\u2019s day, so accustomed to living together it\u2019s no longer a source of excitement but comforting and reassuring. Like deep rooted love.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou want something with your eggs?\u201d Steve asked nonchalantly, his back to her still, ripping her back to reality. Good thing he didn\u2019t see the tears starting to form at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>She blinked them out quickly, adjusting the soft blanket that was still the only thing covering her, \u201cno thanks. Just the eggs is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d He said lightly, placing a teal colored plate before her, handing her a fork.</p><p>She nodded at him as he set on the chair in front of her with a teal plate of his own, starting to eat promptly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d She smiled at him, shuffling the food more than eating it. </p><p>He nodded back, mouth stuffed to the point he couldn\u2019t talk. She smiled a little wider. </p><p><br></p><p>They ate in silence after that, filling the air with the sound of metal on china. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable one, like they often shared; it was charged, air static and unmoving around them, y/n said the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cSo do you have someone? I mean\u2026dating? I mean\u2026you know.\u201d She stumbled over her words, already regretting ever opening her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve remarked, \u201cgod no.\u201d</p><p>Her lips shaped into an adorable pout for a brief moment, turning back into the straight face she had before, failing to hide her obvious dissatisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d She finally said, pushing away the half empty plate.</p><p>\u201cI told you before, y/n. I\u2019m not looking for this, I can\u2019t be. Not just with you, but with anyone. I\u2019m not that guy anymore, I moved on.\u201d His eyes were kind when he looked at her, almost mistaken for pity. He placed his hand on top of hers, voice suddenly softer than before, \u201cso should you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him wide eyed, yanking her hand violently, \u201cme? Moving on?\u201d She scuffed, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to open the door for me every single time, you know. No one is forcing you to undress me every single time I arrive, Steve. Don\u2019t play all innocent on me now, you have faults just as much as me.\u201d</p><p>He was standing up now, towering over her more than usual. Eyes dark but somehow, very calm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026don\u2019t you think I know it\u2019s wrong?\u201d He swallowed, arms to his side, tone still collected, \u201cI hate that I\u2019m leading you on,\u201d she snorted, \u201cI hate it. I really do.\u201d He stepped away from her, grabbing his head in his hands.</p><p>She cleared her throat, speaking almost professionally, \u201cyou made it very clear we are not together, that we cannot be and will never be. I don\u2019t know how naive you think I am, that I don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d She sighed, tears prickling in her eyes again. Damn her and her inability to argue.<br>\u201cI never should\u2019ve come.\u201d</p><p>Y/n got up from her chair, pushing it backwards. She fixed the sheet around her again and walked determined to his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cY/n, it\u2019s not like that! You\u2026you know it\u2019s not\u2026Dammit.\u201d Steve called after her, easily catching up with quick steps. He grabbed her elbow, more forcefully than he intended and she jerked backwards, dropping the white fabric that covered her.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She muttered, meaning to bend over to pick it up when Steve stopped her; holding her in place with his hand on her chin, tilting it up to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI would never be cruel enough to make you be with me.\u201d He whispered, \u201cyou deserve way better y/n. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his beautifully crafted lips, angry red and waiting to be kissed. She bit her own, trying to stop herself from doing something she knew she will.</p><p>The air was buzzing around them again, tension so thick it could be heard. Steve swallowed, eyes fixated on how eager her gaze was on his mouth, suddenly very aware of how naked she was again.</p><p>Her breasts laid soft, hardening nipples erect, raising and falling in a short pace. He could hear her heartbeats from over here. Or was it his own?</p><p>Steve knew it was his fault just as much as it was hers. He could turn her down. He should turn her down; but as her tongue wetted her bottom lip, locking eyes with him, breaking the spell but creating a brand new one, he knew he was gone.</p><p>He took a step closer, inhaling the air she breathed out, looking down to her face, shadow masking half of it, emphasizing the bags under her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Steve whispered in defeat, cupping her jaw with both of his hands and pulling her to reach him. </p><p>Y/n stood on her tiptoes, attaching their lips together and bringing her hands up to find his hair. She tugged, inhaling sharply when she felt two strong hands securing themselves around her thighs; Steve hoisted her up in a sleek motion, mouths separating only for a moment before they started kissing again. She took his bottom lips in hers, allowing his tongue to enter.</p><p>He stroked the insides of her cheeks slowly, exploring the already known, making her breathe softly into him, her tongue aching to find his. </p><p>Steve moved them forward, her back to the open door of the room they left not long ago. Y/n was finally able to reach him; tongues almost dancing, for a second in the free air, then back to her mouth, then back to his. </p><p>He sat on the bed still with her in his arms. Her thighs fell to either side of his lap, her bare sex inevitably rubbing against his clothed one, shooting sparks of pleasure up their spines.</p><p>Steve pulled back, holding her face between his large hands; He was literally holding her, yet she was still so out of his reach. <br>\nHe never really took the time to memorize her features, he realized then- the curve of her eyelashes and the small hairs on her eyebrows and that freckle she had near her nose. </p><p>This face deserved to be cherished, appreciated, by someone better than him. </p><p>He kissed her cheek, staring at her wide eyes, then kissed the edge of her jaw, then her neck, and then behind her ear. She made the most beautiful sound. Only for him. </p><p>\u201c<i>I want you to ride me</i>.\u201d He whispered softly into her ear, instructions sharp and undisputed.</p><p>As she nodded, pupils dilated with lust, he pulled both of them farther into the bed, reaching the cushy river of pillows covered in twisted peach colored sheets, evidence of their last actions earlier. </p><p>Steve placed himself, head leaned again the wooden headboard, creating the perfect view of her. She bent down to kiss the end of his abs, placing a quiet blow on the skin above the black waistband of his boxers. Her nose brushed against the bright trail of hairs decorating his stomach, disappearing under the dark fabric that grew larger every second.</p><p>Y/n pushed down his underwear, revealing his hard cock. Perfect and incredibly big when it hit his stomach. </p><p>Steve groaned, buckling his hips up with impatience, but stopping when she brought one hand to her heat, burying two of her fingers inside and gathering her wetness.</p><p>She moved her palm to his hardening boner, coating it with her juices and pumping him ready.</p><p>When a bit of precum emerged from the tip of him, long vein pulsing and throbbing, she raised her hips up, placing him directly at her entrance. Steve moaned, guiding himself farther between her folds and sliding inside her slowly. The size of him stretching her in the most welcomed way.\u00a0</p><p>Even when it hurt more than pleased, she still loved the feeling of him inside her; So intimate and irreplaceable, the sound of skin on skin. His motions in her, painfully slow and sensible, each movement defined against her walls.</p><p>He was perfect. And she was ruined.<br>She was ruined because she didn\u2019t think she could ever love someone like she loves him.</p><p>Y/n gripped his bicep, clinging for balance as he thrusted particularly hard, his hands supporting her waist.</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d She moaned, trying to speed up against him, rolling her hips in an increasing pace. </p><p>\u201cShh, baby doll. I want to take it slow, okay?\u201d She whined, nodding reluctantly as he steadied her, every thrust long and meaningful, like it was the last time.<br><i>Maybe it was.</i></p><p>Her eyes rolled back in pleasure, Steve filling her up perfectly, her breasts bounced softly with every movement of him, desperate for attention. </p><p><br></p><p>The light huffs and bids of sweat forming on her forehead were telling Steve she was close. Y/n collapsed on top of him as her last measure, needy for more friction and speed to get to her high.</p><p>She was laying on top of him, lower waist secured by his hands as he began to slam into her, rocking her whole body against him as he went relentlessly, promises of taking it slow long forgotten. Pounding deeper and faster with how urgent his name fell from her lips, desperate and dripping wanton. </p><p>She buried her face in his chest, letting him do as he pleased, knowing he can take care of her. </p><p>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m, I\u2019m coming-\u201c She came with a loud cry, her hand trapped between their bodies, two fingers rubbing her clit rapidly, riding her orgasm and clutching her walls around him. </p><p>His cock was twitching inside her, and she raised her head to look at him; eyebrows furrowed in concentration, bottom lip between his teeth capturing a shade so deep she thought was inhumanly possible, sharp cheekbones softened by splatters of rosy blush. </p><p>Steve opened his previously shut eyes, sensing the linger of her gaze on his face as he fucked into her still, enhancing her bliss while chasing his own.</p><p>She kissed the pulsing vain on his neck and the freckle on his shoulder, listening to his moans gradually becoming more desperate, his thrusts less controlled. </p><p>\u201cI want to feel you come Steve.\u201d Y/n hummed lazily in his ear, holding herself higher on his chest, clenching around him with the little strength she had left.</p><p>Steve inhaled sharply, groaning and muttering hushed curses under his breath, releasing loads of warm cum inside her, chipped nails sunken in her smooth back.</p><p>She brought her fingers up from her sensitive clit, laughing at Steve\u2019s frown as she cleaned them with the sheets, bringing her arms back to his chest.</p><p>He kissed her sweaty temple, sliding out of her along with his cum - white streak of liquid dripping out of her hole, slowly finding its way down her thigh.</p><p>\u201cLeave it.\u201d She said tiredly, embracing his shoulder and forcing him to stay down when he tried to clean her up, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Steve bit the inside of his cheek and smirked, holding her closer instead.</p><p>-</p><p>He woke up just when the first rays of sun emerged from the night. Skies dark, still, but now in shades of orange and blue instead of black. Biological clock doing his work.</p><p>There was no note. Not even a text. If it wasn\u2019t for the aching boner, coated with juices that weren\u2019t his - he would\u2019ve thought it was all a dream.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201c<i>Twenty minutes. I\u2019m coming</i>.\u201d </p><p>Y/n typed carefully while the guy in front of her kept talking.</p><p>He was so full of himself, in a restaurant that was too fancy for a first date, and a suit that was too tight for his extremely tall figure. He was too tall. At least a head taller than\u2026</p><p>She cut the thought, immediately. Looking up from her phone to meet his eyes. </p><p>They weren\u2019t blue. And they shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She unlocked her phone again and stared at the cursed send button. A blue arrow pointing up as the embodiment of evil.\u00a0</p><p>She sighed, choosing again to press a long delete instead and looking up to meet his eyes again. He didn\u2019t even notice, adjusting the leather strap of the expensive looking watch on his wrist as to draw her attention to it.</p><p>This man is not Steve. He can\u2019t be. No man can. And as soon as she realizes that, the better.</p><p>Moving on must be better than moving backwards, <i>right</i>?</p>",

Eyes dark but somehow, very calm.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&hellip;don&rsquo;t you think I know it&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He swallowed, arms to his side, tone still collected, &ldquo;I hate that I&rsquo;m leading you on,&rdquo; she snorted, &ldquo;I hate it. I really do.&rdquo; He stepped away from her, grabbing his head in his hands.</p><p>She cleared her throat, speaking almost professionally, &ldquo;you made it very clear we are not together, that we cannot be and will never be. I don&rsquo;t know how naive you think I am, that I don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re doing here.&rdquo; She sighed, tears prickling in her eyes again. Damn her and her inability to argue.<br />&ldquo;I never should&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/n got up from her chair, pushing it backwards. She fixed the sheet around her again and walked determined to his bedroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/n, it&rsquo;s not like that! You&hellip;you know it&rsquo;s not&hellip;Dammit.&rdquo; Steve called after her, easily catching up with quick steps. He grabbed her elbow, more forcefully than he intended and she jerked backwards, dropping the white fabric that covered her.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; She muttered, meaning to bend over to pick it up when Steve stopped her; holding her in place with his hand on her chin, tilting it up to meet his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I would never be cruel enough to make you be with me.&rdquo; He whispered, &ldquo;you deserve way better y/n. Trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>She glanced at his beautifully crafted lips, angry red and waiting to be kissed. She bit her own, trying to stop herself from doing something she knew she will.</p><p>The air was buzzing around them again, tension so thick it could be heard. Steve swallowed, eyes fixated on how eager her gaze was on his mouth, suddenly very aware of how naked she was again.</p><p>Her breasts laid soft, hardening nipples erect, raising and falling in a short pace. He could hear her heartbeats from over here. Or was it his own?</p><p>Steve knew it was his fault just as much as it was hers. He could turn her down. He should turn her down; but as her tongue wetted her bottom lip, locking eyes with him, breaking the spell but creating a brand new one, he knew he was gone.</p><p>He took a step closer, inhaling the air she breathed out, looking down to her face, shadow masking half of it, emphasizing the bags under her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Steve whispered in defeat, cupping her jaw with both of his hands and pulling her to reach him. </p><p>Y/n stood on her tiptoes, attaching their lips together and bringing her hands up to find his hair. She tugged, inhaling sharply when she felt two strong hands securing themselves around her thighs; Steve hoisted her up in a sleek motion, mouths separating only for a moment before they started kissing again. She took his bottom lips in hers, allowing his tongue to enter.</p><p>He stroked the insides of her cheeks slowly, exploring the already known, making her breathe softly into him, her tongue aching to find his. </p><p>Steve moved them forward, her back to the open door of the room they left not long ago. Y/n was finally able to reach him; tongues almost dancing, for a second in the free air, then back to her mouth, then back to his. </p><p>He sat on the bed still with her in his arms. Her thighs fell to either side of his lap, her bare sex inevitably rubbing against his clothed one, shooting sparks of pleasure up their spines.</p><p>Steve pulled back, holding her face between his large hands; He was literally holding her, yet she was still so out of his reach. <br />\nHe never really took the time to memorize her features, he realized then- the curve of her eyelashes and the small hairs on her eyebrows and that freckle she had near her nose. </p><p>This face deserved to be cherished, appreciated, by someone better than him. </p><p>He kissed her cheek, staring at her wide eyes, then kissed the edge of her jaw, then her neck, and then behind her ear. She made the most beautiful sound. Only for him. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I want you to ride me</i>.&rdquo; He whispered softly into her ear, instructions sharp and undisputed.</p><p>As she nodded, pupils dilated with lust, he pulled both of them farther into the bed, reaching the cushy river of pillows covered in twisted peach colored sheets, evidence of their last actions earlier. </p><p>Steve placed himself, head leaned again the wooden headboard, creating the perfect view of her. She bent down to kiss the end of his abs, placing a quiet blow on the skin above the black waistband of his boxers. Her nose brushed against the bright trail of hairs decorating his stomach, disappearing under the dark fabric that grew larger every second.</p><p>Y/n pushed down his underwear, revealing his hard cock. Perfect and incredibly big when it hit his stomach. </p><p>Steve groaned, buckling his hips up with impatience, but stopping when she brought one hand to her heat, burying two of her fingers inside and gathering her wetness.</p><p>She moved her palm to his hardening boner, coating it with her juices and pumping him ready.</p><p>When a bit of precum emerged from the tip of him, long vein pulsing and throbbing, she raised her hips up, placing him directly at her entrance. Steve moaned, guiding himself farther between her folds and sliding inside her slowly. The size of him stretching her in the most welcomed way.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when it hurt more than pleased, she still loved the feeling of him inside her; So intimate and irreplaceable, the sound of skin on skin. His motions in her, painfully slow and sensible, each movement defined against her walls.</p><p>He was perfect. And she was ruined.<br />She was ruined because she didn&rsquo;t think she could ever love someone like she loves him.</p><p>Y/n gripped his bicep, clinging for balance as he thrusted particularly hard, his hands supporting her waist.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve.&rdquo; She moaned, trying to speed up against him, rolling her hips in an increasing pace. </p><p>&ldquo;Shh, baby doll. I want to take it slow, okay?&rdquo; She whined, nodding reluctantly as he steadied her, every thrust long and meaningful, like it was the last time.<br /><i>Maybe it was.</i></p><p>Her eyes rolled back in pleasure, Steve filling her up perfectly, her breasts bounced softly with every movement of him, desperate for attention. </p><p><br /></p><p>The light huffs and bids of sweat forming on her forehead were telling Steve she was close. Y/n collapsed on top of him as her last measure, needy for more friction and speed to get to her high.</p><p>She was laying on top of him, lower waist secured by his hands as he began to slam into her, rocking her whole body against him as he went relentlessly, promises of taking it slow long forgotten. Pounding deeper and faster with how urgent his name fell from her lips, desperate and dripping wanton. </p><p>She buried her face in his chest, letting him do as he pleased, knowing he can take care of her. </p><p>&ldquo;Steve, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m coming-&ldquo; She came with a loud cry, her hand trapped between their bodies, two fingers rubbing her clit rapidly, riding her orgasm and clutching her walls around him. </p><p>His cock was twitching inside her, and she raised her head to look at him; eyebrows furrowed in concentration, bottom lip between his teeth capturing a shade so deep she thought was inhumanly possible, sharp cheekbones softened by splatters of rosy blush. </p><p>Steve opened his previously shut eyes, sensing the linger of her gaze on his face as he fucked into her still, enhancing her bliss while chasing his own.</p><p>She kissed the pulsing vain on his neck and the freckle on his shoulder, listening to his moans gradually becoming more desperate, his thrusts less controlled. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to feel you come Steve.&rdquo; Y/n hummed lazily in his ear, holding herself higher on his chest, clenching around him with the little strength she had left.</p><p>Steve inhaled sharply, groaning and muttering hushed curses under his breath, releasing loads of warm cum inside her, chipped nails sunken in her smooth back.</p><p>She brought her fingers up from her sensitive clit, laughing at Steve&rsquo;s frown as she cleaned them with the sheets, bringing her arms back to his chest.</p><p>He kissed her sweaty temple, sliding out of her along with his cum - white streak of liquid dripping out of her hole, slowly finding its way down her thigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it.&rdquo; She said tiredly, embracing his shoulder and forcing him to stay down when he tried to clean her up, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve bit the inside of his cheek and smirked, holding her closer instead.</p><p>-</p><p>He woke up just when the first rays of sun emerged from the night. Skies dark, still, but now in shades of orange and blue instead of black. Biological clock doing his work.</p><p>There was no note. Not even a text. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the aching boner, coated with juices that weren&rsquo;t his - he would&rsquo;ve thought it was all a dream.</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Twenty minutes. I&rsquo;m coming</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>Y/n typed carefully while the guy in front of her kept talking.</p><p>He was so full of himself, in a restaurant that was too fancy for a first date, and a suit that was too tight for his extremely tall figure. He was too tall. At least a head taller than&hellip;</p><p>She cut the thought, immediately. Looking up from her phone to meet his eyes. </p><p>They weren&rsquo;t blue. And they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>She unlocked her phone again and stared at the cursed send button. A blue arrow pointing up as the embodiment of evil.&nbsp;</p><p>She sighed, choosing again to press a long delete instead and looking up to meet his eyes again. He didn&rsquo;t even notice, adjusting the leather strap of the expensive looking watch on his wrist as to draw her attention to it.</p><p>This man is not Steve. He can&rsquo;t be. No man can. And as soon as she realizes that, the better.</p><p>Moving on must be better than moving backwards, <i>right</i>?</p>",

I hope you can still enjoy it.</p><p>This story is not beta\u2019d. Please forgive any errors or plot holes.</p><p><i>I do not know any of the individuals depicted in this story.

The man hadn\u2019t even been home twenty-four hours and he was already making a mess. </p><!-- more --><p>I finished squeezing the excess water from my hair and put both of our towels in the hamper before walking back into the bedroom to put on my usual lazy day attire of sweatpants and one of Chris\u2019 discarded hoodies before joining him in the living room.</p><p>\u201cHey babe,\u201d he said, instantly wrapping an arm around me and pulling me in for a swift kiss before settling back against the arm.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him, resting my head on his chest, and revealed in the feeling of being in his arms. I closed my eyes and let my body relax against his.</p><p>Being away from Chris was never something I looked forward to. The distance made keeping a relationship going hard. Doing so without being noticed when you were in the public eye was even more so. We\u2019d been together for a little over a year before he asked me to move in with him. Somehow we\u2019d been able to keep our relationship out of the papers by being very careful about our interactions in public. We never went to events together, and most of our dates had been incredibly low key to keep anyone from noticing us. </p><p>I guess that was one good thing about dating someone you\u2019d know for half your life. Dates could be a simple as pizza and a movie at someone\u2019s house. There was no need for grand gestures or places that would impress one another when you\u2019d known each other since grade school. </p><p>Chris and I had become fast friends when my father had been assigned to train recruits at the ROTC in Boston. We\u2019d been thick as thieves until my father had been assigned to Fort Hood and my family had been forced to move to Texas. We\u2019d tried to stay in touch over the years with varying degrees of success, but when I\u2019d moved back to Boston a few years ago, we\u2019d reconnected and eventually started dating. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chris ran his hand up and down my arm, \u201cwhat would you think about going to the premiere with me next month?\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot open. Carefully pressing against his chest to help myself sit up, I studied Chris\u2019 face for any sign that he was joking. For an actor, Chris had a terrible poker face. He never seemed to be able to keep the corner of his mouth from twitching when he was trying to pull one over on me, but that muscle wasn\u2019t twitching now. His expression was perfectly calm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I asked, barely able to believe it.</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He shifted into a seated position so that he could look me in the eye. \u201cI know we agreed to keep things private, and I still want to. What we do is our own business. \u00a0I just don\u2019t want to have to go to events without you anymore.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped open, but I quickly slammed it shut. \u201cYou want me to go with you? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>Chris gave me a sweetly seductive smile and nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to start taking you to events with me. That doesn\u2019t mean I plan on telling everyone everything. The only questions I will answer about us are ones that we\u2019ve agreed to first.\u201d He shifted a bit closer and took my hands in his. \u201cI just want you by my side when I do this.\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted back and forth between his. There was nothing but sincerity in his clear blue gaze. The open honest expression actually threatened to steal my breath away. </p><p>\u201cI,\u201d I paused to lick my lips and pull my thoughts together. I didn'\u2019t want Chris to think that I didn\u2019t want to be seen with him. Anybody on the planet would count themselves lucky to be on his arm. I just didn\u2019t know how to tell him I was worried about how I would come across without hurting his feelings. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea? I mean, I\u2019m not exactly a fancy clothes and makeup kind of person.\u201d \u00a0I gestured to my current attire. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even own a pair of heels.\u201d</p><p>An amused half smile formed on Chris\u2019 lips. \u201cI like wet hair and sweatpants. I like sneakers and ponytails. In fact,\u201d he slid a little closer to me. \u201c I think they\u2019re fucking sexy.\u201d He pressed his lips to mine in a swift but passionate kiss, letting me know exactly what he thought of the way I looked in his cast-off clothing. \u201cSo what do you say. Will you go with me?\u201d</p><p>Chris ran his thumb back and forth across my check. I closed my eyes and leaned into his touch, placing a kiss on the inside of his wrist. When I opened my eyes again, I felt at peace with my decision.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit

I closed my eyes and let my body relax against his.</p><p>Being away from Chris was never something I looked forward to. The distance made keeping a relationship going hard. Doing so without being noticed when you were in the public eye was even more so. We\u2019d been together for a little over a year before he asked me to move in with him. Somehow we\u2019d been able to keep our relationship out of the papers by being very careful about our interactions in public. We never went to events together, and most of our dates had been incredibly low key to keep anyone from noticing us. </p><p>I guess that was one good thing about dating someone you\u2019d know for half your life. Dates could be a simple as pizza and a movie at someone\u2019s house. There was no need for grand gestures or places that would impress one another when you\u2019d known each other since grade school. </p><p>Chris and I had become fast friends when my father had been assigned to train recruits at the ROTC in Boston. We\u2019d been thick as thieves until my father had been assigned to Fort Hood and my family had been forced to move to Texas. We\u2019d tried to stay in touch over the years with varying degrees of success, but when I\u2019d moved back to Boston a few years ago, we\u2019d reconnected and eventually started dating. </p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chris ran his hand up and down my arm, \u201cwhat would you think about going to the premiere with me next month?\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot open. Carefully pressing against his chest to help myself sit up, I studied Chris\u2019 face for any sign that he was joking. For an actor, Chris had a terrible poker face. He never seemed to be able to keep the corner of his mouth from twitching when he was trying to pull one over on me, but that muscle wasn\u2019t twitching now. His expression was perfectly calm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I asked, barely able to believe it.</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He shifted into a seated position so that he could look me in the eye. \u201cI know we agreed to keep things private, and I still want to. What we do is our own business. \u00a0I just don\u2019t want to have to go to events without you anymore.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped open, but I quickly slammed it shut. \u201cYou want me to go with you? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>Chris gave me a sweetly seductive smile and nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to start taking you to events with me. That doesn\u2019t mean I plan on telling everyone everything. The only questions I will answer about us are ones that we\u2019ve agreed to first.\u201d He shifted a bit closer and took my hands in his. \u201cI just want you by my side when I do this.\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted back and forth between his. There was nothing but sincerity in his clear blue gaze. The open honest expression actually threatened to steal my breath away. </p><p>\u201cI,\u201d I paused to lick my lips and pull my thoughts together. I didn'\u2019t want Chris to think that I didn\u2019t want to be seen with him. Anybody on the planet would count themselves lucky to be on his arm. I just didn\u2019t know how to tell him I was worried about how I would come across without hurting his feelings. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea? I mean, I\u2019m not exactly a fancy clothes and makeup kind of person.\u201d \u00a0I gestured to my current attire. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even own a pair of heels.\u201d</p><p>An amused half smile formed on Chris\u2019 lips. \u201cI like wet hair and sweatpants. I like sneakers and ponytails. In fact,\u201d he slid a little closer to me. \u201c I think they\u2019re fucking sexy.\u201d He pressed his lips to mine in a swift but passionate kiss, letting me know exactly what he thought of the way I looked in his cast-off clothing. \u201cSo what do you say. Will you go with me?\u201d</p><p>Chris ran his thumb back and forth across my check. I closed my eyes and leaned into his touch, placing a kiss on the inside of his wrist. When I opened my eyes again, I felt at peace with my decision.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b><i><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit

He never seemed to be able to keep the corner of his mouth from twitching when he was trying to pull one over on me, but that muscle wasn\u2019t twitching now. His expression was perfectly calm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I asked, barely able to believe it.</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He shifted into a seated position so that he could look me in the eye. \u201cI know we agreed to keep things private, and I still want to. What we do is our own business. \u00a0I just don\u2019t want to have to go to events without you anymore.\u201d</p><p>My mouth gaped open, but I quickly slammed it shut. \u201cYou want me to go with you? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>Chris gave me a sweetly seductive smile and nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to start taking you to events with me. That doesn\u2019t mean I plan on telling everyone everything. The only questions I will answer about us are ones that we\u2019ve agreed to first.\u201d He shifted a bit closer and took my hands in his. \u201cI just want you by my side when I do this.\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted back and forth between his. There was nothing but sincerity in his clear blue gaze. The open honest expression actually threatened to steal my breath away. </p><p>\u201cI,\u201d I paused to lick my lips and pull my thoughts together. I didn'\u2019t want Chris to think that I didn\u2019t want to be seen with him. Anybody on the planet would count themselves lucky to be on his arm. I just didn\u2019t know how to tell him I was worried about how I would come across without hurting his feelings. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea? I mean, I\u2019m not exactly a fancy clothes and makeup kind of person.\u201d \u00a0I gestured to my current attire. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even own a pair of heels.\u201d</p><p>An amused half smile formed on Chris\u2019 lips. \u201cI like wet hair and sweatpants. I like sneakers and ponytails. In fact,\u201d he slid a little closer to me. \u201c I think they\u2019re fucking sexy.\u201d He pressed his lips to mine in a swift but passionate kiss, letting me know exactly what he thought of the way I looked in his cast-off clothing. \u201cSo what do you say. Will you go with me?\u201d</p><p>Chris ran his thumb back and forth across my check. I closed my eyes and leaned into his touch, placing a kiss on the inside of his wrist. When I opened my eyes again, I felt at peace with my decision.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><b><i><a href=\"http://blacktithe7.tumblr.com/ask\" target=\"_blank\">Submit

Now Chris is thinking it may be time to change that.</p><p>Prompt: I like wet hair and sweatpants. I like sneakers and ponytails.</p><p>Word Count: 1000</p><p>Warning: language</p><p>Author&rsquo;s Note: This story is my submission for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdqJ3syPOMR3iOJOiNK9NCQ\" target=\"_blank\">@until-theend-oftheline</a>&rsquo;s Kari&rsquo;s Chris Evans Challenge. I had a lot more trouble with this story than I thought I would, and with me being gone so much&hellip; I ran out of time to polish it as much as I would like before the due date. I hope you can still enjoy it.</p><p>This story is not beta&rsquo;d. Please forgive any errors or plot holes.</p><p><i>I do not know any of the individuals depicted in this story.

The man hadn&rsquo;t even been home twenty-four hours and he was already making a mess. </p><p>I finished squeezing the excess water from my hair and put both of our towels in the hamper before walking back into the bedroom to put on my usual lazy day attire of sweatpants and one of Chris&rsquo; discarded hoodies before joining him in the living room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey babe,&rdquo; he said, instantly wrapping an arm around me and pulling me in for a swift kiss before settling back against the arm.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around him, resting my head on his chest, and revealed in the feeling of being in his arms. I closed my eyes and let my body relax against his.</p><p>Being away from Chris was never something I looked forward to. The distance made keeping a relationship going hard. Doing so without being noticed when you were in the public eye was even more so. We&rsquo;d been together for a little over a year before he asked me to move in with him. Somehow we&rsquo;d been able to keep our relationship out of the papers by being very careful about our interactions in public. We never went to events together, and most of our dates had been incredibly low key to keep anyone from noticing us. </p><p>I guess that was one good thing about dating someone you&rsquo;d know for half your life. Dates could be a simple as pizza and a movie at someone&rsquo;s house. There was no need for grand gestures or places that would impress one another when you&rsquo;d known each other since grade school. </p><p>Chris and I had become fast friends when my father had been assigned to train recruits at the ROTC in Boston. We&rsquo;d been thick as thieves until my father had been assigned to Fort Hood and my family had been forced to move to Texas. We&rsquo;d tried to stay in touch over the years with varying degrees of success, but when I&rsquo;d moved back to Boston a few years ago, we&rsquo;d reconnected and eventually started dating. </p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Chris ran his hand up and down my arm, &ldquo;what would you think about going to the premiere with me next month?&rdquo;</p><p>My eyes shot open. Carefully pressing against his chest to help myself sit up, I studied Chris&rsquo; face for any sign that he was joking. For an actor, Chris had a terrible poker face.

        "body": "<h1>Lovely </h1><p>I could feel it slipping deep inside me.  Consuming me, my body wasn&rsquo;t mine anymore, my mind, my voice. They were for someone else, all of it was for someone else. Lying there in that darkness, my form slipped along with it, coming loose, coming undone.  And I kept begging for it to stop, that I couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore, I couldn&rsquo;t see, it was scary. It was frightening.  I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t.  Ha&hellip;  Maybe that&rsquo;s what was wrong with me, maybe I was a liar. Cause I told her I wasn&rsquo;t scared. With a smile on my face and a gentle stroke against her body, I whispered to her , &ldquo;I want you to do it. Mess me up. I&rsquo;m not scared.&rdquo;  </p><p>But I was. Even then I was. And so even now I am. But maybe that was just it. The fear, the exhilarating feeling of danger, of the unknown. I loved it so much. I got high off it like drugs.  But who knew&hellip; Who knew this was going to happen.  Lying here. In this darkness. Who ever would be able to forsee this. Who could warn me.  Lying here, in this darkness. On this bed. This beautiful canopy bed. It was soft and warm. But it hurt my skin, my wrist, my ankles. My thick neck. Sometimes I couldn&rsquo;t breath. Wait- No&hellip; No, that was her hands. It was because of her hands, she likes to choke me. She&rsquo;s so different to everyone else. Smiling genuinely, being kind and making jokes, laughing, even acting timid at some points. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not even her, like I&rsquo;m seeing someone else&hellip;  I hate her, but I&rsquo;d never tell her cause I&rsquo;m scared of her. But I think she knows I&rsquo;m scared, I think she always knew. Sometimes she smiles at me like she does.  And then I get confused. I get confused and wonder if actually I love her . If all along that was what I was really scared of.  I get so confused. Even now as I glance over weakly into her dark doe brown eyes I&rsquo;m confused.  </p><p>Sometimes her eyes gleam red, shiny and taunting and heating up my skin like a torching fire. I wonder if every time I let her lay me down on this bed, I&rsquo;m allowing myself to enter the gates of hell.  Staring at her lips now I watch her lick away a bit of blood where I bit her and remember how my mom used to say women like her have demons. That I should stay away from them cause they bring nothing but bad karma. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t say how hard it would be, how good it felt to get lost in She never told me how beautiful she&rsquo;d be. She just said it was dangerous, I guess she expected me to know when I saw one of those &ldquo;women with a demon inside&rdquo;, I guess maybe she never met one so she just didn&rsquo;t know herself.  But I guess I should&rsquo;ve known, I always knew the most beautiful things were the most dangerous. So I should&rsquo;ve known.  But that&rsquo;d be unfair to say, everyday she walks amongst the world and not one person notices. No one ever has. </p><p>She&rsquo;s so good at it. Being normal, being human. Keeping her demons contained.  I didn&rsquo;t think they could love too you know. Mom never told me that either, and I suspect it&rsquo;s because she didn&rsquo;t think so. But demons love. Demons love too. You just can&rsquo;t tell, it&rsquo;s hard to understand cause it a bit twisted.  The way a demon loves is&hellip; Abnormal.  </p><p>Swirling of the colors, dark red, soft blues and greys, and then black. There&rsquo;s black everywhere. When you close your eyes, when you open them. The love is the kind that hums against your skin, and it stings, and then it cools down and flows through your blood and becomes so so good. It makes your body tremble for more. See&hellip; that&rsquo;s the dangerous kind of love. Because you&rsquo;re not yourself anymore, someone else has you, playing with you like a toy, pulling strings, pressing the right buttons.  Rewiring you. Messing you up. But you like it. You can&rsquo;t stop coming back for more. But is that really even love? One wonders. </p><p>Maybe not to many, too most, to the sane.  But demons love too, I promise you they do, even if it&rsquo;s a little different they do. Cause their voice touches your skin like silk and whips, and even when it&rsquo;s been days you can feel their hands touching places you&rsquo;ve never let anyone else touch. And then more. Your wrist cause they like to hold you down. Restrain you, they like to watch you fight&hellip; Cause she knows it&rsquo;s useless.  </p><p>Demons love too. Just not in the way humans do.  Like right now. She likes to watch me, I think that&rsquo;s how she tells me she loves me. It&rsquo;s also where I get confused about how I feel.  She likes to watch me seated in her chair, arms and legs crossed. She was good at just sitting there watching me. Her control was so well tamed it scared me.  But it wasn&rsquo;t the worst part. It was when she got up, it was what she&rsquo;d do next.  And she got up just now. She just got up walking steadily to me. Her brown eyes like hell fire, looking down at my naked weak state. Usually I couldn&rsquo;t see well, the way the lights were so dim in this room paired with how dazed I&rsquo;d usually be it was difficult to focus. </p><p>But I was okay now and I could see her soft body hovering over me while her hand rested at her sides. Slowly she huffs out, and then smiles a little bit. And I think shamefully of how she&rsquo;s got such a pretty smile.  When one of her hands raises from her hip, I flinch. She smiles wider when noticing my reaction and my eyes well up with tears. She sucks her teeth with a tsk tsk sound, shaking her head and looks at me with sympathy.  &ldquo;You poor thing,&rdquo; her soft voice is low and void, &ldquo;Just look at you&hellip;&rdquo; She leans down so her face is closer and she strokes my cheek gently, &ldquo;I pity you, you know that?&rdquo; She says that, but its almost as if she likes it.  She sucks her teeth again and then sighs before sitting down on the bed running a hand through her dark brown hair. She leans forward to my hands where she unbound my wrist, and then does the same to my ankles. Before resting her elbows on her knees having her lithe back facing me only.  Rubbing the sore areas I stare at her confused. But then I look away, remembering how I&rsquo;m not supposed to stare at her too long unless she asks me to.  &ldquo;Umm&hellip;&rdquo; My voice is so meak I don&rsquo;t think she even noticed me trying to speak.  </p><p>&ldquo;Get dressed and go home.&rdquo; She clasps her hands together.  I snap my head back up and again I&rsquo;m looking at her, &ldquo;Wha&hellip; What?&rdquo; We&rsquo;d barely done anything tonight, and I can&rsquo;t help but notice the sinking feeling of dissatisfaction in my stomach. I hadn&rsquo;t even climaxed yet. I can&rsquo;t just go home so bothered like this.  &ldquo;I said go home.&rdquo;  &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;  She turns around and looks at me but she doesn&rsquo;t seem angry. Instead she leans towards me again resting her right hand against the mattress beside my left hip. And quickly I felt trapped in between her current position. She was leaning in so close, &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; She ask  &ldquo;I&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t even,&rdquo; fidgeting, I look down and away from her face. You could tell she had a bit of freckles if you were close enough to see them, even against her sienna toned skin. </p><p>And she had sharp eyes, but you couldn&rsquo;t tell in her everyday attire. If she wanted to, she could make anyone who swung her way kneel before her . But she didn&rsquo;t only because it&rsquo;d ruin her everyday image.  &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; her other hand is touching my face again. Stroking my cheek touching my hair, &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; She says calmly and I do, suddenly finding it hard to breath. I hated looking at her when we were this close. I felt like I wanted to run away yet also kiss her , but I could do neither. </p><p>Instead I could only stay there gazing at her thinking of how beautiful of a woman she was&hellip;  &ldquo;Does it feel frustrating?&rdquo; She ask me and she sounds concerned.  I nod, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Mm&rdquo; she hand lowers to my chin and I watch her smile as she stares at my lips, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. When you go home. You can&rsquo;t touch yourself you hear me?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Wh-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Answer the question.&rdquo;  I look away for a split second, &ldquo;F-Fine.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Good boy.&rdquo; She kisses my cheek and whispers, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a good boy you know that? Makes me want to eat you whole.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What about you then, won&rsquo;t you-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey, hey&hellip;&rdquo; She says gently then her lids lower a bit and she cocks her head as she looks at me, and still smiling she says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that okay. If you question me one more time though, I&rsquo;ll do something to make you cry okay.&rdquo;  </p><p>I swallow a lump in my throat and shut my eyes tightly pulling my knees close to my chest, &ldquo;S-Sorry.&rdquo;  Immediately she begins stroking my arm in a coaxing manner, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s okay. Just be good and listen and I won&rsquo;t do anything bad okay. I promise. We don&rsquo;t want that right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I whisper. I open my eyes slowly but I still don&rsquo;t look at her .  &ldquo;Okay, okay good then. Now get dresssed.&rdquo;  I do as she says. </p><p>Moving out of bed slowly since my body was a bit sore. I try to put my clothing on as quick as possible. It was my work clothes since I&rsquo;d came here straight from it. A cheap suit I\u2019d had sitting in the back of my closet. I put my dress shoes on and grab my keys  then stand there in the the middle of the room staring at her back for a moment waiting for her to say something. I&rsquo;m not sure if she knows I was done getting dressed since she hadn&rsquo;t turned around to look at me.  &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m done, so&hellip; I&rsquo;m just gonna go.&rdquo;  She doesn&rsquo;t say anything and I make my way to the door. Before I can open it though, she stops me, &ldquo;Wait. Come here.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ah&hellip; Okay.&rdquo; I put my keys in my pocket and walk to the other side of the bed and stand before her .  &ldquo;Come closer&hellip; get on your knees&hellip; Good.&rdquo;  </p><p>She smiles, seemingly satisfied and my face heats. She grabs my pale hands into her brown ones and places one on each of her knees. I look up at her confused her bangs cover her eyes as she looks down at me. She had springy curls that fell over her forehead in the front. All I could see was her upturned button nose, her lips which still has a bit of blood, and the under-defined, gentle shaped lower half of her face. Her jaw was soft but mature.  &ldquo;Were you planning on leaving without kissing me goodbye,&rdquo; she pats my head and her fingers rest in between the locks of my short tossled hair. </p><p>I had washed it and did my best to style it knowing I was coming here today. Sometimes she gives me compliments and foolishly I become pleased by them.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t know-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; She almost laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;d be rude to say now wouldn&rsquo;t it. Surely I&rsquo;ve taught you better than that.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;  She sighs heavily then shakes her head, &ldquo;You say that a lot don&rsquo;t you&hellip; Sorry. Stop saying sorry. Just do better.&quot;She grabs my chin and lifts my face higher, &quot;It&rsquo;s okay for today. Come here.&rdquo;  She presses her lips against mine and not once do I feel her tongue against my own and I think about how well she restricted herself tonight. Sometimes I wonder if she likes the pent up tension. </p><p>Cause whenever she does this, it calls for a future session of heavy and long activities.  I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t like it too.  When she pulls away from me I lick my lips and taste her blood against my tongue.  &ldquo;Ah, yes&hellip;&rdquo; She notices, &ldquo;You like to bite a lot, Stevie. I&rsquo;ll have to punish you for that one of these days right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Y-You said you liked it&hellip;&rdquo; I whisper.  &ldquo;Yes I did.&rdquo; She laughs then just stares a moment until satisfied and she says, &ldquo;Well go on then. Drive safe love. Good night.&rdquo;  I stare at her then, boldly in the eyes as she leans back and her bangs shift out of the way. Her smile is playful and she looks amused. I look away then and leave.  </p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo; I say before shutting the door behind me.  I walk quickly out the apartment building, not stopping to say hello to anyone or even meeting anyone&rsquo;s gaze. And in the car I sit there in the parking lot for a few minutes. Starting the car but not moving. The radio played lowly in the background a song I&rsquo;ve heard frequently now and I wonder if it&rsquo;s a top hit.  I hear her sing it sometimes.  She&rsquo;s got a nice voice. Gentle and deep. </p><p>Very coaxing, the kind that can put you to sleep. It wasn&rsquo;t monotone though, but instead a nice mixure of peaceful yet sexy&hellip;  I stare down at my hands playing with my bitten up nails. Then I notice my sheer black stalkings, I\u2019m still lost on when and how she convinced me to wear them for her. She had torn them before pushing me onto her bed and tying me up. And then she played with me. Endlessly teasing. Stopping just before I climaxed, and continued the cycle. Before she left me tied onto the bed, and then sat in her chair to just watch me, she&rsquo;d tell to me open my legs wider, or to arch my back, to turn my head, expose my neck. Sometimes she&rsquo;d untie my hands and tell me to touch myself and to not take my eyes off of her as I do.  And at times she&rsquo;d do that for so so long, I&rsquo;d lose track of time. </p><p>But it was mostly from the cause of me being unable to think straight.  Sighing I raise the radios volume and then remove my stockings, stuffing them in glove compartment. I had suggested not wearing stockings once and she told me not to ask her about it ever again. She liked seeing me in them through out the day, she liked the idea of having to rip them off. She even tried giving me the money to buy new ones. Which had become constant now.  Throughout the day it was kind of different. The habits were a bit switched mainly, and she was much more lenient usually because she had to be. But at the same time, I never could expect what she&rsquo;d do. It was always sudden always new. Always sensual.  Sighing, I feel my pants tighten as I remember the ways she&rsquo;s touched my body. But then I lift my hands gripping the wheel as I remember how she&rsquo;s told me not to touch myself.  So instead I switch the gear to drive, and I head home. </p><p>My apartment was much bigger than hers. But it was more dark and less welcoming. Bucky liked to come over a lot and decorate. I had soft beige carpeting, while she had grey. My kitchen was bigger but had less food. My bathroom a bit messy, my bed king sized and by the window so I had view of the sky at night. Her average sized canopy bed rested far from the window, more against the wall in the middle of the room. Her windows were small , her decorations orderly and sleek. Minimal. </p><p>The curtains in her room which were light and colored lilac were always kept open, which contributed to the brightness of her room.  But it fit her. That night I slept holding a T-shirt I had stolen from her in secrecy only because she wouldn&rsquo;t let me keep any of her clothing. I remember taking it to help me feel as though I slept with her at night. She&rsquo;d send me back home usually after spending time together, and if it was too late she&rsquo;d let me sleep in her bed while she slept on the sofa.  I slip my hands in between my legs and curl into a ball underneath my covers. It was cold that night. Middle November.  So it was starting to chill.</p>",

I put my dress shoes on and grab my keys  then stand there in the the middle of the room staring at her back for a moment waiting for her to say something. I\u2019m not sure if she knows I was done getting dressed since she hadn\u2019t turned around to look at me.  \u201cI-I\u2019m done, so\u2026 I\u2019m just gonna go.\u201d  She doesn\u2019t say anything and I make my way to the door. Before I can open it though, she stops me, \u201cWait. Come here.\u201d  \u201cAh\u2026 Okay.\u201d I put my keys in my pocket and walk to the other side of the bed and stand before her .  \u201cCome closer\u2026 get on your knees\u2026 Good.\u201d  </p><p>She smiles, seemingly satisfied and my face heats. She grabs my pale hands into her brown ones and places one on each of her knees. I look up at her confused her bangs cover her eyes as she looks down at me. She had springy curls that fell over her forehead in the front. All I could see was her upturned button nose, her lips which still has a bit of blood, and the under-defined, gentle shaped lower half of her face. Her jaw was soft but mature.  \u201cWere you planning on leaving without kissing me goodbye,\u201d she pats my head and her fingers rest in between the locks of my short tossled hair. </p><p>I had washed it and did my best to style it knowing I was coming here today. Sometimes she gives me compliments and foolishly I become pleased by them.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know-\u201d  \u201cDidn\u2019t know?\u201d She almost laughed, \u201cThat\u2019d be rude to say now wouldn\u2019t it. Surely I\u2019ve taught you better than that.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d  She sighs heavily then shakes her head, \u201cYou say that a lot don\u2019t you\u2026 Sorry. Stop saying sorry. Just do better.\"She grabs my chin and lifts my face higher, \"It\u2019s okay for today. Come here.\u201d  She presses her lips against mine and not once do I feel her tongue against my own and I think about how well she restricted herself tonight. Sometimes I wonder if she likes the pent up tension. </p><p>Cause whenever she does this, it calls for a future session of heavy and long activities.  I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t like it too.  When she pulls away from me I lick my lips and taste her blood against my tongue.  \u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201d She notices, \u201cYou like to bite a lot, Stevie. I\u2019ll have to punish you for that one of these days right?\u201d  \u201cY-You said you liked it\u2026\u201d I whisper.  \u201cYes I did.\u201d She laughs then just stares a moment until satisfied and she says, \u201cWell go on then. Drive safe love. Good night.\u201d  I stare at her then, boldly in the eyes as she leans back and her bangs shift out of the way. Her smile is playful and she looks amused. I look away then and leave.  </p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d I say before shutting the door behind me.  I walk quickly out the apartment building, not stopping to say hello to anyone or even meeting anyone\u2019s gaze. And in the car I sit there in the parking lot for a few minutes. Starting the car but not moving. The radio played lowly in the background a song I\u2019ve heard frequently now and I wonder if it\u2019s a top hit.  I hear her sing it sometimes.  She\u2019s got a nice voice. Gentle and deep. </p><p>Very coaxing, the kind that can put you to sleep. It wasn\u2019t monotone though, but instead a nice mixure of peaceful yet sexy\u2026  I stare down at my hands playing with my bitten up nails. Then I notice my sheer black stalkings, I\u2019m still lost on when and how she convinced me to wear them for her. She had torn them before pushing me onto her bed and tying me up. And then she played with me. Endlessly teasing. Stopping just before I climaxed, and continued the cycle. Before she left me tied onto the bed, and then sat in her chair to just watch me, she\u2019d tell to me open my legs wider, or to arch my back, to turn my head, expose my neck. Sometimes she\u2019d untie my hands and tell me to touch myself and to not take my eyes off of her as I do.  And at times she\u2019d do that for so so long, I\u2019d lose track of time. </p><p>But it was mostly from the cause of me being unable to think straight.  Sighing I raise the radios volume and then remove my stockings, stuffing them in glove compartment. I had suggested not wearing stockings once and she told me not to ask her about it ever again. She liked seeing me in them through out the day, she liked the idea of having to rip them off. She even tried giving me the money to buy new ones. Which had become constant now.  Throughout the day it was kind of different. The habits were a bit switched mainly, and she was much more lenient usually because she had to be. But at the same time, I never could expect what she\u2019d do. It was always sudden always new. Always sensual.  Sighing, I feel my pants tighten as I remember the ways she\u2019s touched my body. But then I lift my hands gripping the wheel as I remember how she\u2019s told me not to touch myself.  So instead I switch the gear to drive, and I head home. </p><p>My apartment was much bigger than hers. But it was more dark and less welcoming. Bucky liked to come over a lot and decorate. I had soft beige carpeting, while she had grey. My kitchen was bigger but had less food. My bathroom a bit messy, my bed king sized and by the window so I had view of the sky at night. Her average sized canopy bed rested far from the window, more against the wall in the middle of the room. Her windows were small , her decorations orderly and sleek. Minimal. </p><p>The curtains in her room which were light and colored lilac were always kept open, which contributed to the brightness of her room.  But it fit her. That night I slept holding a T-shirt I had stolen from her in secrecy only because she wouldn\u2019t let me keep any of her clothing. I remember taking it to help me feel as though I slept with her at night. She\u2019d send me back home usually after spending time together, and if it was too late she\u2019d let me sleep in her bed while she slept on the sofa.  I slip my hands in between my legs and curl into a ball underneath my covers. It was cold that night. Middle November.  So it was starting to chill.</p></p>",

They were for someone else, all of it was for someone else. Lying there in that darkness, my form slipped along with it, coming loose, coming undone.  And I kept begging for it to stop, that I couldn\u2019t do it anymore, I couldn\u2019t see, it was scary. It was frightening.  I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t.  Ha\u2026  Maybe that\u2019s what was wrong with me, maybe I was a liar. Cause I told her I wasn\u2019t scared. With a smile on my face and a gentle stroke against her body, I whispered to her , \u201cI want you to do it. Mess me up. I\u2019m not scared.\u201d  </p><p>But I was. Even then I was. And so even now I am. But maybe that was just it. The fear, the exhilarating feeling of danger, of the unknown. I loved it so much. I got high off it like drugs.  But who knew\u2026 Who knew this was going to happen.  Lying here. In this darkness. Who ever would be able to forsee this. Who could warn me.  Lying here, in this darkness. On this bed. This beautiful canopy bed. It was soft and warm. But it hurt my skin, my wrist, my ankles. My thick neck. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t breath. Wait- No\u2026 No, that was her hands. It was because of her hands, she likes to choke me. She\u2019s so different to everyone else. Smiling genuinely, being kind and making jokes, laughing, even acting timid at some points. It\u2019s like it\u2019s not even her, like I\u2019m seeing someone else\u2026  I hate her, but I\u2019d never tell her cause I\u2019m scared of her. But I think she knows I\u2019m scared, I think she always knew. Sometimes she smiles at me like she does.  And then I get confused. I get confused and wonder if actually I love her . If all along that was what I was really scared of.  I get so confused. Even now as I glance over weakly into her dark doe brown eyes I\u2019m confused.  </p><p>Sometimes her eyes gleam red, shiny and taunting and heating up my skin like a torching fire. I wonder if every time I let her lay me down on this bed, I\u2019m allowing myself to enter the gates of hell.  Staring at her lips now I watch her lick away a bit of blood where I bit her and remember how my mom used to say women like her have demons. That I should stay away from them cause they bring nothing but bad karma. </p><p>She didn\u2019t say how hard it would be, how good it felt to get lost in She never told me how beautiful she\u2019d be. She just said it was dangerous, I guess she expected me to know when I saw one of those \u201cwomen with a demon inside\u201d, I guess maybe she never met one so she just didn\u2019t know herself.  But I guess I should\u2019ve known, I always knew the most beautiful things were the most dangerous. So I should\u2019ve known.  But that\u2019d be unfair to say, everyday she walks amongst the world and not one person notices. No one ever has. </p><p>She\u2019s so good at it. Being normal, being human. Keeping her demons contained.  I didn\u2019t think they could love too you know. Mom never told me that either, and I suspect it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t think so. But demons love. Demons love too. You just can\u2019t tell, it\u2019s hard to understand cause it a bit twisted.  The way a demon loves is\u2026 Abnormal.  </p><p>Swirling of the colors, dark red, soft blues and greys, and then black. There\u2019s black everywhere. When you close your eyes, when you open them. The love is the kind that hums against your skin, and it stings, and then it cools down and flows through your blood and becomes so so good. It makes your body tremble for more. See\u2026 that\u2019s the dangerous kind of love. Because you\u2019re not yourself anymore, someone else has you, playing with you like a toy, pulling strings, pressing the right buttons.  Rewiring you. Messing you up. But you like it. You can\u2019t stop coming back for more. But is that really even love? One wonders. </p><p>Maybe not to many, too most, to the sane.  But demons love too, I promise you they do, even if it\u2019s a little different they do. Cause their voice touches your skin like silk and whips, and even when it\u2019s been days you can feel their hands touching places you\u2019ve never let anyone else touch. And then more. Your wrist cause they like to hold you down. Restrain you, they like to watch you fight\u2026 Cause she knows it\u2019s useless.  </p><p>Demons love too. Just not in the way humans do.  Like right now. She likes to watch me, I think that\u2019s how she tells me she loves me. It\u2019s also where I get confused about how I feel.  She likes to watch me seated in her chair, arms and legs crossed. She was good at just sitting there watching me. Her control was so well tamed it scared me.  But it wasn\u2019t the worst part. It was when she got up, it was what she\u2019d do next.  And she got up just now. She just got up walking steadily to me. Her brown eyes like hell fire, looking down at my naked weak state. Usually I couldn\u2019t see well, the way the lights were so dim in this room paired with how dazed I\u2019d usually be it was difficult to focus. </p><p>But I was okay now and I could see her soft body hovering over me while her hand rested at her sides. Slowly she huffs out, and then smiles a little bit. And I think shamefully of how she\u2019s got such a pretty smile.  When one of her hands raises from her hip, I flinch. She smiles wider when noticing my reaction and my eyes well up with tears. She sucks her teeth with a tsk tsk sound, shaking her head and looks at me with sympathy.  \u201cYou poor thing,\u201d her soft voice is low and void, \u201cJust look at you\u2026\u201d She leans down so her face is closer and she strokes my cheek gently, \u201cI pity you, you know that?\u201d She says that, but its almost as if she likes it.  She sucks her teeth again and then sighs before sitting down on the bed running a hand through her dark brown hair. She leans forward to my hands where she unbound my wrist, and then does the same to my ankles. Before resting her elbows on her knees having her lithe back facing me only.  Rubbing the sore areas I stare at her confused. But then I look away, remembering how I\u2019m not supposed to stare at her too long unless she asks me to.  \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d My voice is so meak I don\u2019t think she even noticed me trying to speak.  </p><p>\u201cGet dressed and go home.\u201d She clasps her hands together.  I snap my head back up and again I\u2019m looking at her, \u201cWha\u2026 What?\u201d We\u2019d barely done anything tonight, and I can\u2019t help but notice the sinking feeling of dissatisfaction in my stomach. I hadn\u2019t even climaxed yet. I can\u2019t just go home so bothered like this.  \u201cI said go home.\u201d  \u201cBut\u2026\u201d  She turns around and looks at me but she doesn\u2019t seem angry. Instead she leans towards me again resting her right hand against the mattress beside my left hip. And quickly I felt trapped in between her current position. She was leaning in so close, \u201cBut what?\u201d She ask  \u201cI\u2026 I haven\u2019t even,\u201d fidgeting, I look down and away from her face. You could tell she had a bit of freckles if you were close enough to see them, even against her sienna toned skin. </p><p>And she had sharp eyes, but you couldn\u2019t tell in her everyday attire. If she wanted to, she could make anyone who swung her way kneel before her . But she didn\u2019t only because it\u2019d ruin her everyday image.  \u201cI know,\u201d her other hand is touching my face again. Stroking my cheek touching my hair, \u201cLook at me.\u201d She says calmly and I do, suddenly finding it hard to breath. I hated looking at her when we were this close. I felt like I wanted to run away yet also kiss her , but I could do neither. </p><p>Instead I could only stay there gazing at her thinking of how beautiful of a woman she was\u2026  \u201cDoes it feel frustrating?\u201d She ask me and she sounds concerned.  I nod, \u201cYes.\u201d  \u201cMm\u201d she hand lowers to my chin and I watch her smile as she stares at my lips, \u201cThat\u2019s good. When you go home. You can\u2019t touch yourself you hear me?\u201d  \u201cWh-\u201d  \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d  I look away for a split second, \u201cF-Fine.\u201d  \u201cGood boy.\u201d She kisses my cheek and whispers, \u201cYou\u2019re such a good boy you know that? Makes me want to eat you whole.\u201d  \u201cWhat about you then, won\u2019t you-\u201d  \u201cHey, hey\u2026\u201d She says gently then her lids lower a bit and she cocks her head as she looks at me, and still smiling she says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that okay. If you question me one more time though, I\u2019ll do something to make you cry okay.\u201d  </p><p>I swallow a lump in my throat and shut my eyes tightly pulling my knees close to my chest, \u201cS-Sorry.\u201d  Immediately she begins stroking my arm in a coaxing manner, \u201cDon\u2019t do that. It\u2019s okay. Just be good and listen and I won\u2019t do anything bad okay. I promise. We don\u2019t want that right?\u201d  \u201cNo,\u201d I whisper. I open my eyes slowly but I still don\u2019t look at her .  \u201cOkay, okay good then. Now get dresssed.\u201d  I do as she says. </p><p>Moving out of bed slowly since my body was a bit sore. I try to put my clothing on as quick as possible. It was my work clothes since I\u2019d came here straight from it. A cheap suit I\u2019d had sitting in the back of my closet. I put my dress shoes on and grab my keys  then stand there in the the middle of the room staring at her back for a moment waiting for her to say something. I\u2019m not sure if she knows I was done getting dressed since she hadn\u2019t turned around to look at me.  \u201cI-I\u2019m done, so\u2026 I\u2019m just gonna go.\u201d  She doesn\u2019t say anything and I make my way to the door. Before I can open it though, she stops me, \u201cWait. Come here.\u201d  \u201cAh\u2026 Okay.\u201d I put my keys in my pocket and walk to the other side of the bed and stand before her .  \u201cCome closer\u2026 get on your knees\u2026 Good.\u201d  </p><p>She smiles, seemingly satisfied and my face heats. She grabs my pale hands into her brown ones and places one on each of her knees. I look up at her confused her bangs cover her eyes as she looks down at me. She had springy curls that fell over her forehead in the front. All I could see was her upturned button nose, her lips which still has a bit of blood, and the under-defined, gentle shaped lower half of her face. Her jaw was soft but mature.  \u201cWere you planning on leaving without kissing me goodbye,\u201d she pats my head and her fingers rest in between the locks of my short tossled hair. </p><p>I had washed it and did my best to style it knowing I was coming here today. Sometimes she gives me compliments and foolishly I become pleased by them.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know-\u201d  \u201cDidn\u2019t know?\u201d She almost laughed, \u201cThat\u2019d be rude to say now wouldn\u2019t it. Surely I\u2019ve taught you better than that.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d  She sighs heavily then shakes her head, \u201cYou say that a lot don\u2019t you\u2026 Sorry. Stop saying sorry. Just do better.\"She grabs my chin and lifts my face higher, \"It\u2019s okay for today. Come here.\u201d  She presses her lips against mine and not once do I feel her tongue against my own and I think about how well she restricted herself tonight. Sometimes I wonder if she likes the pent up tension. </p><p>Cause whenever she does this, it calls for a future session of heavy and long activities.  I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t like it too.  When she pulls away from me I lick my lips and taste her blood against my tongue.  \u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201d She notices, \u201cYou like to bite a lot, Stevie. I\u2019ll have to punish you for that one of these days right?\u201d  \u201cY-You said you liked it\u2026\u201d I whisper.  \u201cYes I did.\u201d She laughs then just stares a moment until satisfied and she says, \u201cWell go on then. Drive safe love. Good night.\u201d  I stare at her then, boldly in the eyes as she leans back and her bangs shift out of the way. Her smile is playful and she looks amused. I look away then and leave.  </p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d I say before shutting the door behind me.  I walk quickly out the apartment building, not stopping to say hello to anyone or even meeting anyone\u2019s gaze. And in the car I sit there in the parking lot for a few minutes.

She\u2019s got a nice voice. Gentle and deep. </p><p>Very coaxing, the kind that can put you to sleep.

I had soft beige carpeting, while she had grey. My kitchen was bigger but had less food. My bathroom a bit messy, my bed king sized and by the window so I had view of the sky at night. Her average sized canopy bed rested far from the window, more against the wall in the middle of the room. Her windows were small , her decorations orderly and sleek. Minimal. </p><p>The curtains in her room which were light and colored lilac were always kept open, which contributed to the brightness of her room.  But it fit her. That night I slept holding a T-shirt I had stolen from her in secrecy only because she wouldn\u2019t let me keep any of her clothing. I remember taking it to help me feel as though I slept with her at night. She\u2019d send me back home usually after spending time together, and if it was too late she\u2019d let me sleep in her bed while she slept on the sofa.  I slip my hands in between my legs and curl into a ball underneath my covers. It was cold that night. Middle November.  So it was starting to chill.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Lovely </h1><p>I could feel it slipping deep inside me.  Consuming me, my body wasn&rsquo;t mine anymore, my mind, my voice. They were for someone else, all of it was for someone else. Lying there in that darkness, my form slipped along with it, coming loose, coming undone.  And I kept begging for it to stop, that I couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore, I couldn&rsquo;t see, it was scary. It was frightening.  I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t.  Ha&hellip;  Maybe that&rsquo;s what was wrong with me, maybe I was a liar. Cause I told her I wasn&rsquo;t scared. With a smile on my face and a gentle stroke against her body, I whispered to her , &ldquo;I want you to do it. Mess me up. I&rsquo;m not scared.&rdquo;  </p><p>But I was. Even then I was. And so even now I am. But maybe that was just it. The fear, the exhilarating feeling of danger, of the unknown. I loved it so much. I got high off it like drugs.  But who knew&hellip; Who knew this was going to happen.  Lying here. In this darkness. Who ever would be able to forsee this. Who could warn me.  Lying here, in this darkness. On this bed. This beautiful canopy bed. It was soft and warm. But it hurt my skin, my wrist, my ankles. My thick neck. Sometimes I couldn&rsquo;t breath. Wait- No&hellip; No, that was her hands. It was because of her hands, she likes to choke me. She&rsquo;s so different to everyone else. Smiling genuinely, being kind and making jokes, laughing, even acting timid at some points. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not even her, like I&rsquo;m seeing someone else&hellip;  I hate her, but I&rsquo;d never tell her cause I&rsquo;m scared of her. But I think she knows I&rsquo;m scared, I think she always knew. Sometimes she smiles at me like she does.  And then I get confused. I get confused and wonder if actually I love her . If all along that was what I was really scared of.  I get so confused. Even now as I glance over weakly into her dark doe brown eyes I&rsquo;m confused.  </p><p>Sometimes her eyes gleam red, shiny and taunting and heating up my skin like a torching fire. I wonder if every time I let her lay me down on this bed, I&rsquo;m allowing myself to enter the gates of hell.  Staring at her lips now I watch her lick away a bit of blood where I bit her and remember how my mom used to say women like her have demons. That I should stay away from them cause they bring nothing but bad karma. </p><p>She didn&rsquo;t say how hard it would be, how good it felt to get lost in She never told me how beautiful she&rsquo;d be. She just said it was dangerous, I guess she expected me to know when I saw one of those &ldquo;women with a demon inside&rdquo;, I guess maybe she never met one so she just didn&rsquo;t know herself.  But I guess I should&rsquo;ve known, I always knew the most beautiful things were the most dangerous. So I should&rsquo;ve known.  But that&rsquo;d be unfair to say, everyday she walks amongst the world and not one person notices. No one ever has. </p><p>She&rsquo;s so good at it. Being normal, being human. Keeping her demons contained.  I didn&rsquo;t think they could love too you know. Mom never told me that either, and I suspect it&rsquo;s because she didn&rsquo;t think so. But demons love. Demons love too. You just can&rsquo;t tell, it&rsquo;s hard to understand cause it a bit twisted.  The way a demon loves is&hellip; Abnormal.  </p><p>Swirling of the colors, dark red, soft blues and greys, and then black. There&rsquo;s black everywhere. When you close your eyes, when you open them. The love is the kind that hums against your skin, and it stings, and then it cools down and flows through your blood and becomes so so good. It makes your body tremble for more. See&hellip; that&rsquo;s the dangerous kind of love. Because you&rsquo;re not yourself anymore, someone else has you, playing with you like a toy, pulling strings, pressing the right buttons.  Rewiring you. Messing you up. But you like it. You can&rsquo;t stop coming back for more. But is that really even love? One wonders. </p><p>Maybe not to many, too most, to the sane.  But demons love too, I promise you they do, even if it&rsquo;s a little different they do. Cause their voice touches your skin like silk and whips, and even when it&rsquo;s been days you can feel their hands touching places you&rsquo;ve never let anyone else touch. And then more. Your wrist cause they like to hold you down. Restrain you, they like to watch you fight&hellip; Cause she knows it&rsquo;s useless.  </p><p>Demons love too. Just not in the way humans do.  Like right now. She likes to watch me, I think that&rsquo;s how she tells me she loves me. It&rsquo;s also where I get confused about how I feel.  She likes to watch me seated in her chair, arms and legs crossed. She was good at just sitting there watching me. Her control was so well tamed it scared me.  But it wasn&rsquo;t the worst part. It was when she got up, it was what she&rsquo;d do next.  And she got up just now. She just got up walking steadily to me. Her brown eyes like hell fire, looking down at my naked weak state. Usually I couldn&rsquo;t see well, the way the lights were so dim in this room paired with how dazed I&rsquo;d usually be it was difficult to focus. </p><p>But I was okay now and I could see her soft body hovering over me while her hand rested at her sides. Slowly she huffs out, and then smiles a little bit. And I think shamefully of how she&rsquo;s got such a pretty smile.  When one of her hands raises from her hip, I flinch. She smiles wider when noticing my reaction and my eyes well up with tears. She sucks her teeth with a tsk tsk sound, shaking her head and looks at me with sympathy.  &ldquo;You poor thing,&rdquo; her soft voice is low and void, &ldquo;Just look at you&hellip;&rdquo; She leans down so her face is closer and she strokes my cheek gently, &ldquo;I pity you, you know that?&rdquo; She says that, but its almost as if she likes it.  She sucks her teeth again and then sighs before sitting down on the bed running a hand through her dark brown hair. She leans forward to my hands where she unbound my wrist, and then does the same to my ankles. Before resting her elbows on her knees having her lithe back facing me only.  Rubbing the sore areas I stare at her confused. But then I look away, remembering how I&rsquo;m not supposed to stare at her too long unless she asks me to.  &ldquo;Umm&hellip;&rdquo; My voice is so meak I don&rsquo;t think she even noticed me trying to speak.  </p><p>&ldquo;Get dressed and go home.&rdquo; She clasps her hands together.  I snap my head back up and again I&rsquo;m looking at her, &ldquo;Wha&hellip; What?&rdquo; We&rsquo;d barely done anything tonight, and I can&rsquo;t help but notice the sinking feeling of dissatisfaction in my stomach. I hadn&rsquo;t even climaxed yet. I can&rsquo;t just go home so bothered like this.  &ldquo;I said go home.&rdquo;  &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;  She turns around and looks at me but she doesn&rsquo;t seem angry. Instead she leans towards me again resting her right hand against the mattress beside my left hip. And quickly I felt trapped in between her current position. She was leaning in so close, &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; She ask  &ldquo;I&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t even,&rdquo; fidgeting, I look down and away from her face. You could tell she had a bit of freckles if you were close enough to see them, even against her sienna toned skin. </p><p>And she had sharp eyes, but you couldn&rsquo;t tell in her everyday attire. If she wanted to, she could make anyone who swung her way kneel before her . But she didn&rsquo;t only because it&rsquo;d ruin her everyday image.  &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; her other hand is touching my face again. Stroking my cheek touching my hair, &ldquo;Look at me.&rdquo; She says calmly and I do, suddenly finding it hard to breath. I hated looking at her when we were this close. I felt like I wanted to run away yet also kiss her , but I could do neither. </p><p>Instead I could only stay there gazing at her thinking of how beautiful of a woman she was&hellip;  &ldquo;Does it feel frustrating?&rdquo; She ask me and she sounds concerned.  I nod, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Mm&rdquo; she hand lowers to my chin and I watch her smile as she stares at my lips, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. When you go home. You can&rsquo;t touch yourself you hear me?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Wh-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Answer the question.&rdquo;  I look away for a split second, &ldquo;F-Fine.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Good boy.&rdquo; She kisses my cheek and whispers, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a good boy you know that? Makes me want to eat you whole.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What about you then, won&rsquo;t you-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Hey, hey&hellip;&rdquo; She says gently then her lids lower a bit and she cocks her head as she looks at me, and still smiling she says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that okay. If you question me one more time though, I&rsquo;ll do something to make you cry okay.&rdquo;  </p><p>I swallow a lump in my throat and shut my eyes tightly pulling my knees close to my chest, &ldquo;S-Sorry.&rdquo;  Immediately she begins stroking my arm in a coaxing manner, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s okay. Just be good and listen and I won&rsquo;t do anything bad okay. I promise. We don&rsquo;t want that right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I whisper. I open my eyes slowly but I still don&rsquo;t look at her .  &ldquo;Okay, okay good then. Now get dresssed.&rdquo;  I do as she says. </p><p>Moving out of bed slowly since my body was a bit sore. I try to put my clothing on as quick as possible. It was my work clothes since I&rsquo;d came here straight from it. A cheap suit I&rsquo;d had sitting in the back of my closet. I put my dress shoes on and grab my keys  then stand there in the the middle of the room staring at her back for a moment waiting for her to say something. I&rsquo;m not sure if she knows I was done getting dressed since she hadn&rsquo;t turned around to look at me.  &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m done, so&hellip; I&rsquo;m just gonna go.&rdquo;  She doesn&rsquo;t say anything and I make my way to the door. Before I can open it though, she stops me, &ldquo;Wait. Come here.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ah&hellip; Okay.&rdquo; I put my keys in my pocket and walk to the other side of the bed and stand before her .  &ldquo;Come closer&hellip; get on your knees&hellip; Good.&rdquo;  </p><p>She smiles, seemingly satisfied and my face heats. She grabs my pale hands into her brown ones and places one on each of her knees. I look up at her confused her bangs cover her eyes as she looks down at me. She had springy curls that fell over her forehead in the front. All I could see was her upturned button nose, her lips which still has a bit of blood, and the under-defined, gentle shaped lower half of her face. Her jaw was soft but mature.  &ldquo;Were you planning on leaving without kissing me goodbye,&rdquo; she pats my head and her fingers rest in between the locks of my short tossled hair. </p><p>I had washed it and did my best to style it knowing I was coming here today. Sometimes she gives me compliments and foolishly I become pleased by them.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t know-&rdquo;  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; She almost laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;d be rude to say now wouldn&rsquo;t it. Surely I&rsquo;ve taught you better than that.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;  She sighs heavily then shakes her head, &ldquo;You say that a lot don&rsquo;t you&hellip; Sorry. Stop saying sorry. Just do better.\"She grabs my chin and lifts my face higher, \"It&rsquo;s okay for today. Come here.&rdquo;  She presses her lips against mine and not once do I feel her tongue against my own and I think about how well she restricted herself tonight. Sometimes I wonder if she likes the pent up tension. </p><p>Cause whenever she does this, it calls for a future session of heavy and long activities.  I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t like it too.  When she pulls away from me I lick my lips and taste her blood against my tongue.  &ldquo;Ah, yes&hellip;&rdquo; She notices, &ldquo;You like to bite a lot, Stevie. I&rsquo;ll have to punish you for that one of these days right?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Y-You said you liked it&hellip;&rdquo; I whisper.  &ldquo;Yes I did.&rdquo; She laughs then just stares a moment until satisfied and she says, &ldquo;Well go on then. Drive safe love. Good night.&rdquo;  I stare at her then, boldly in the eyes as she leans back and her bangs shift out of the way. Her smile is playful and she looks amused. I look away then and leave.  </p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo; I say before shutting the door behind me.  I walk quickly out the apartment building, not stopping to say hello to anyone or even meeting anyone&rsquo;s gaze. And in the car I sit there in the parking lot for a few minutes. Starting the car but not moving. The radio played lowly in the background a song I&rsquo;ve heard frequently now and I wonder if it&rsquo;s a top hit.  I hear her sing it sometimes.  She&rsquo;s got a nice voice. Gentle and deep. </p><p>Very coaxing, the kind that can put you to sleep. It wasn&rsquo;t monotone though, but instead a nice mixure of peaceful yet sexy&hellip;  I stare down at my hands playing with my bitten up nails. Then I notice my sheer black stalkings, I&rsquo;m still lost on when and how she convinced me to wear them for her. She had torn them before pushing me onto her bed and tying me up. And then she played with me. Endlessly teasing. Stopping just before I climaxed, and continued the cycle. Before she left me tied onto the bed, and then sat in her chair to just watch me, she&rsquo;d tell to me open my legs wider, or to arch my back, to turn my head, expose my neck. Sometimes she&rsquo;d untie my hands and tell me to touch myself and to not take my eyes off of her as I do.  And at times she&rsquo;d do that for so so long, I&rsquo;d lose track of time. </p><p>But it was mostly from the cause of me being unable to think straight.  Sighing I raise the radios volume and then remove my stockings, stuffing them in glove compartment. I had suggested not wearing stockings once and she told me not to ask her about it ever again. She liked seeing me in them through out the day, she liked the idea of having to rip them off. She even tried giving me the money to buy new ones. Which had become constant now.  Throughout the day it was kind of different. The habits were a bit switched mainly, and she was much more lenient usually because she had to be. But at the same time, I never could expect what she&rsquo;d do. It was always sudden always new. Always sensual.  Sighing, I feel my pants tighten as I remember the ways she&rsquo;s touched my body. But then I lift my hands gripping the wheel as I remember how she&rsquo;s told me not to touch myself.  So instead I switch the gear to drive, and I head home. </p><p>My apartment was much bigger than hers. But it was more dark and less welcoming. Bucky liked to come over a lot and decorate. I had soft beige carpeting, while she had grey. My kitchen was bigger but had less food. My bathroom a bit messy, my bed king sized and by the window so I had view of the sky at night. Her average sized canopy bed rested far from the window, more against the wall in the middle of the room. Her windows were small , her decorations orderly and sleek. Minimal. </p><p>The curtains in her room which were light and colored lilac were always kept open, which contributed to the brightness of her room.  But it fit her. That night I slept holding a T-shirt I had stolen from her in secrecy only because she wouldn&rsquo;t let me keep any of her clothing. I remember taking it to help me feel as though I slept with her at night. She&rsquo;d send me back home usually after spending time together, and if it was too late she&rsquo;d let me sleep in her bed while she slept on the sofa.  I slip my hands in between my legs and curl into a ball underneath my covers. It was cold that night. Middle November.  So it was starting to chill.</p></p>",
