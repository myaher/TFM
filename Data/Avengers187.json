But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn\u2019t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another.

Steve\ntried to remember it, his heart pounded in his chest. He didn&rsquo;t know what to\nsay.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>.&rdquo; His voice barely came out as a whisper.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Oh. You know what, forget it. It&rsquo;s not important, we don&rsquo;t have to talk\nabout it and-&rdquo; Steve cut him off.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>.&rdquo; Steve repeated and Tony sighed.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah cap?&rdquo; Steve couldn&rsquo;t contain his smile.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You are impossible and difficult and I hate it when you go three days\nwithout sleep. You once yelled at me for making your coffee wrong and you are\none of the most irrational people I know. But you are good and loving and I\nwouldn&rsquo;t want anyone else to be Peter&rsquo;s father. You&rsquo;re one of the best men I\nknow and I know I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but telling you I love\nyou in the hospital wasn&rsquo;t one of them. I love you Tony.&rdquo; And it was like\na massive weight fell off of Steve&rsquo;s shoulders. He watched Tony&rsquo;s eyes widened\nand Steve&rsquo;s heart pounded in his chest. He&rsquo;d said it. It was out there in the\nworld.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Steve-&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say it back Tony. I know I said we&rsquo;d take this slow but\nI am in love with you and it&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re not in love with me.&rdquo; Steve\ntold him gently.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony was speechless. He was loved. Someone else\non this damn planet loved him and of all people, it was Steve. Steven Grant\nRogers had fallen in love with Anthony Edward Stark and that in itself was a\nfucking miracle. Steve had chosen Tony and had fallen in love with him and\nwants to raise Peter with him.<br/>\n&ldquo;Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth Rogers. But these\npast couple months with you and Peter have been the best of my life and I guess\nsomewhere along the way I fell in love with you too.&rdquo; Tony confessed and Steve&rsquo;s\neyes widened.<br/>\n&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked and Tony rolled his eyes.<br/>\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to drive me insane Rogers.&rdquo; Tony muttered and crossed\nthe distance to Steve, crashing his lips against Steve&rsquo;s. Steve responded\ninstantly and gripped the side of Tony&rsquo;s face. Steve&rsquo;s hands moved and pulled Tony\ninto his lap, and Tony kissed Steve&rsquo;s lips furiously, taking and taking and\ntaking. Steve was his, that was just the way it was. He and Steve belonged\ntogether. Steve finally pulled back and leaned his forehead against Tony&rsquo;s.<br/>\n&ldquo;Easy, easy.&rdquo; He breathed and Tony smirked.<br/>\n&ldquo;Easy has never been my style Steve.&rdquo; He murmured and kissed Steve&rsquo;s\nneck, claiming him as his own. Steve moaned and just hearing that sound sent\nshivers through Tony&rsquo;s body. Steve&rsquo;s hands slid down to Tony&rsquo;s ass and Tony\nrocked into Steve, causing the blonde to moan even louder this time.<br/>\n&ldquo;Are you sure Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve nodded.<br/>\n&ldquo;Absolutely positive.&rdquo; And then Steve brought his lips against Tony&rsquo;s,\nkissing him and Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but smile against his lips. Tony rocked his\nhips again and he was relieved Peter was with May.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;<i>Tony</i>.&rdquo; Steve groaned and Tony smirked. He loved knowing he\nhad this effect on Steve.<br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah Cap?&rdquo; Tony asked and something darkened in Steve&rsquo;s eyes. He\ncrashed his lips against Tony&rsquo;s and Tony&rsquo;s fingers entangled themselves in Steve&rsquo;s\nhair. Soon Steve was lifting Tony up and carrying him towards Steve&rsquo;s bedroom.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve and Tony were simply gazing into one\nanother&rsquo;s eyes in blissful silence. The sun was rising and everything had\nturned into a golden haze as the light filtered in through the window.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;So now what?&rdquo; Steve asked, his voice rough. Steve had decided to\nfinally break the silence. Tony looked away and that simple act alone was\nenough to make Steve wish he&rsquo;d never said anything.<br/>\n&ldquo;Now we should probably get up and get ready for the day. I&rsquo;ve got a\nmeeting with Fury and Bruce wants to check up on you.&rdquo; Tony said, rolling\nover and getting out of Steve&rsquo;s bed. Steve watched him, a slight frown on his\nface and then Tony left his room. With a sigh, Steve rolled onto his back and\nstared up at the ceiling. Great. After declaring their love for one another and\nfor what came\u00a0<i>after</i>\u00a0that, Steve was supposed to get a check up\nfrom Bruce and Tony was going to have a meeting with Fury. Like any other,\nboring, normal and completely-average day. Great.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony knew exactly what Steve had been asking in\nbed this morning. But he wasn&rsquo;t ready to have that discussion. He and Steve\nwere practically together already, and the night before had only solidified\nthat. But to officially say it out loud felt different somehow. It felt more\nvulnerable and a part of Tony was terrified that Steve was only seconds from\nturning around and declaring that the night before had been a huge mistake. So\nlike always, he ran. Not far, only into the next room. But he&rsquo;d still gotten\nout of there as quickly as possible. And now he was sitting in a cab, mere\ninches away from Steve. Neither of them said a word. Tony glanced at Peter who\nwas sitting on Steve&rsquo;s lap, looking back and forth between them both. The cab\npulled up to the compound, Tony paid and they got out. Tony looked to Steve to\nfind Steve was already watching him.<br/>\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up Rogers?&rdquo; Tony hated how much it sounded like he didn&rsquo;t\ncare. He knew this looked bad and he knew it was a defense mechanism. He didn&rsquo;t\nwant walls up when it came to Steve, but some old habits simply die hard.<br/>\n&ldquo;Are we going to go in there and pretend like last night didn&rsquo;t\nhappen?&rdquo; Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.<br/>\n&ldquo;What do you want exactly Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked, he didn&rsquo;t want to say\nor do the wrong thing.<br/>\n&ldquo;You.&rdquo; Steve smirked and Tony swallowed.<br/>\n&ldquo;oh.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;I understand that this is messy and complicated and there are a million\npeople out there who are going to think this is twisted and wrong and Maybe\nthis doesn&rsquo;t last. But it&rsquo;s here now and I love you and you love me and that&rsquo;s\nall that matters to me now. So I want\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0Tony.&rdquo; It sent\nthe warm and fuzzies through Tony&rsquo;s body. He was wanted, he was loved, he had\nbeen chosen. And simply knowing that made Tony&rsquo;s heart swell, so he crossed the\nspace between them and crashed his lips against Steve&rsquo;s.<br/>\n&ldquo;Why are you so perfect?&rdquo; he asked as he pulled back, leaning his\nforehead against Steve&rsquo;s.<br/>\n&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; Steve whispered and Tony grinned.<br/>\n&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; Tony whispered and Steve grinned. Then hand in\nhand, they entered the avengers compound. Together.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt like Steve was in a dream, like none of\nthis was real. It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be real. This couldn&rsquo;t be happening to him.\nBut it was real, his life had fallen perfectly together. And it was all because\nof the little boy in his arms.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You are a miracle.&rdquo; Steve told Peter as they entered Bruce&rsquo;s\nlab.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; Bruce asked and Steve felt like he was the\nluckiest person alive.<br/>\n&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He murmured and sat down. He sat through all the tests,\nwatched as Bruce checked on Peter. But when Bruce investigated some of Steve&rsquo;s\nbroken ribs, he frowned.<br/>\n&ldquo;These have gotten worse.&rdquo; He murmured and Steve&rsquo;s heart rate sped\nup. Just a little.<br/>\n&ldquo;Been doing strenuous exercise Steve?&rdquo; Nat said from the doorway. Steve\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the blush, he simply looked down at his hands.<br/>\n&ldquo;A couple weeks rest won&rsquo;t hurt Steve. You need to heal first.&rdquo; Bruce\ntold him and Steve nodded his head.<br/>\n&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some coffee, want anything?&rdquo; Bruce asked. Both Steve\nand Natasha shook their heads. The second Bruce was out the door, Natasha\npunched his arm.<br/>\n&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about you and Tony?&rdquo; she demanded and Steve\nrubbed the spot she had hit.<br/>\n&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he demanded.<br/>\n&ldquo;I figured it out at the hospital, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut and sighed.<br/>\n&ldquo;It was all so new, I guess we just sort of wanted to stay in our own\nlittle happy bubble before telling everyone.&rdquo; Steve shrugged and Nat was\nscowling.<br/>\n&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not everyone.&rdquo; She said in a small voice.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I was going to tell you first anyway.&rdquo; Steve told her and she nodded\nher head.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You better have.&rdquo; She told him and Steve grinned.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I told him I love him.&rdquo; Nat&rsquo;s eyes widened and Steve looked at Peter,\nat his son.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;And what did Tony say?&rdquo; She demanded and Steve couldn&rsquo;t stop the\ngrin.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;He told me he loved me.&rdquo; Even Nat smiled.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you two.&rdquo; She told him and Steve nodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for us and for all we know Tony and I\ncould break up tomorrow. But this feels good and it feels right and I can\npicture a future with Tony.&rdquo; Steve explained and Nat nodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Good. You and Stark deserve to be happy.&rdquo; She told you and he\nnodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Thanks Nat. You deserve to be happy too.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;My standards are too high.&rdquo; She told him dryly and Steve couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but raise an eyebrow.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Too high or is it simply that you&rsquo;ve already found the person?&rdquo; Steve\nasked and she glared at him.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;We already have had this discussion Steve.&rdquo; She said in a voice that\nmade Steve rethink pursuing this conversation.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d be happy with-&rdquo; she squeezed her eyes shut.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;He has a girlfriend.&rdquo; She said at long last and Steve&rsquo;s eyes\nwidened.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry-&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Laura&rsquo;s nice. She&rsquo;s good for Clint.&rdquo; But Steve could see\nthe pain in Nat&rsquo;s eyes.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m here if you ever want to talk about it.&rdquo; She\nnodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Thanks Steve. And you shouldn&rsquo;t be training when you&rsquo;re injured.&rdquo; Nat\nscolded and Steve smirked.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Who said I was training?&rdquo; He asked and she groaned.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need to know that.&rdquo; And Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but grin. Peter\nwas his. Tony Stark was his. He had everything he could have ever wanted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n<br/></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly Tony and Steve let the avengers know they\nwere together. Most people had already accepted that idea months ago which had\nsurprised Tony. But everyone had simply decided that they&rsquo;d fall in love once\nthey had adopted Peter. It was nice that they all approved, but Tony wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave cared even if they hadn&rsquo;t approved. He loved Steve and Steve was his and\nthat was all that mattered. A part of Tony kept waiting for him to wake up. To\nfind out this was all a dream. He&rsquo;d be on that awful couch and none of this\nwould have happened. Maybe Steve chose Bucky. Maybe none of this was real. But\neach time Steve hugged him or kissed him or said he loved him, it hit Tony that\nthis was his reality. And it was the best feeling in the whole damn\nworld.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Steve&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off and Steve looked up at him.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;<br/>\n&ldquo;You look ridiculous.&rdquo; Steve broke out laughing. Tony had recently\nbought him an apron that said\u00a0<i>hot stuff</i>. Tony meant is as a joke\nbut now Steve wore it every time he cooked.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve thought it through when you bought it for me then.&rdquo; Tony\ngroaned.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Just come sit with me and Peter. We can order pizza!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed\nand Steve chuckled.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;If you had your way we would have pizza every night.&rdquo; Tony\nshrugged.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a downside of that.&rdquo; Steve shook his head.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Play the movie, I&rsquo;ll make dinner.&rdquo; Steve told him and Tony sighed. Peter\nwas playing with one of his toys, so Tony stood up and walked to the\nkitchen.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I feel bad.&rdquo; He murmured and watched Steve chop up a carrot.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Go watch the movie Tony.&rdquo; Instead Tony wrapped his arms around Steve&rsquo;s\nwaist, pressing his face into Steve&rsquo;s back.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;I can help with dinner.&rdquo; He knew Steve was grinning, Tony was\ngrinning himself.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;You will be nothing but a distraction.&rdquo; Steve told him gently.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;A distraction? Do I distract you Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve\nchuckled.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Go watch the movie Tony. I&rsquo;ll be there soon.&rdquo; With a heavy sigh Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Okay. But give me a kiss first.&rdquo; So Steve turned in his arms and\npressed his lips against Tony&rsquo;s.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Now go watch the movie so I can make dinner.&rdquo; Steve murmured and Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br/>\n&ldquo;Alright Rogers.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n<br/></p>",

You once yelled at me for making your coffee wrong and you are\none of the most irrational people I know. But you are good and loving and I\nwouldn\u2019t want anyone else to be Peter\u2019s father. You\u2019re one of the best men I\nknow and I know I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but telling you I love\nyou in the hospital wasn\u2019t one of them. I love you Tony.\u201d And it was like\na massive weight fell off of Steve\u2019s shoulders. He watched Tony\u2019s eyes widened\nand Steve\u2019s heart pounded in his chest. He\u2019d said it. It was out there in the\nworld.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cSteve-\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back Tony. I know I said we\u2019d take this slow but\nI am in love with you and it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not in love with me.\u201d Steve\ntold him gently.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony was speechless. He was loved. Someone else\non this damn planet loved him and of all people, it was Steve. Steven Grant\nRogers had fallen in love with Anthony Edward Stark and that in itself was a\nfucking miracle. Steve had chosen Tony and had fallen in love with him and\nwants to raise Peter with him.<br>\n\u201cSometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth Rogers. But these\npast couple months with you and Peter have been the best of my life and I guess\nsomewhere along the way I fell in love with you too.\u201d Tony confessed and Steve\u2019s\neyes widened.<br>\n\u201cReally?\u201d he asked and Tony rolled his eyes.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to drive me insane Rogers.\u201d Tony muttered and crossed\nthe distance to Steve, crashing his lips against Steve\u2019s. Steve responded\ninstantly and gripped the side of Tony\u2019s face. Steve\u2019s hands moved and pulled Tony\ninto his lap, and Tony kissed Steve\u2019s lips furiously, taking and taking and\ntaking. Steve was his, that was just the way it was. He and Steve belonged\ntogether. Steve finally pulled back and leaned his forehead against Tony\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cEasy, easy.\u201d He breathed and Tony smirked.<br>\n\u201cEasy has never been my style Steve.\u201d He murmured and kissed Steve\u2019s\nneck, claiming him as his own. Steve moaned and just hearing that sound sent\nshivers through Tony\u2019s body. Steve\u2019s hands slid down to Tony\u2019s ass and Tony\nrocked into Steve, causing the blonde to moan even louder this time.<br>\n\u201cAre you sure Steve?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded.<br>\n\u201cAbsolutely positive.\u201d And then Steve brought his lips against Tony\u2019s,\nkissing him and Tony couldn\u2019t help but smile against his lips. Tony rocked his\nhips again and he was relieved Peter was with May.\u00a0<br>\n\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve groaned and Tony smirked. He loved knowing he\nhad this effect on Steve.<br>\n\u201cYeah Cap?\u201d Tony asked and something darkened in Steve\u2019s eyes. He\ncrashed his lips against Tony\u2019s and Tony\u2019s fingers entangled themselves in Steve\u2019s\nhair. Soon Steve was lifting Tony up and carrying him towards Steve\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve and Tony were simply gazing into one\nanother\u2019s eyes in blissful silence. The sun was rising and everything had\nturned into a golden haze as the light filtered in through the window.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d Steve asked, his voice rough. Steve had decided to\nfinally break the silence. Tony looked away and that simple act alone was\nenough to make Steve wish he\u2019d never said anything.<br>\n\u201cNow we should probably get up and get ready for the day. I\u2019ve got a\nmeeting with Fury and Bruce wants to check up on you.\u201d Tony said, rolling\nover and getting out of Steve\u2019s bed. Steve watched him, a slight frown on his\nface and then Tony left his room. With a sigh, Steve rolled onto his back and\nstared up at the ceiling. Great. After declaring their love for one another and\nfor what came\u00a0<i>after</i>\u00a0that, Steve was supposed to get a check up\nfrom Bruce and Tony was going to have a meeting with Fury. Like any other,\nboring, normal and completely-average day. Great.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony knew exactly what Steve had been asking in\nbed this morning. But he wasn\u2019t ready to have that discussion. He and Steve\nwere practically together already, and the night before had only solidified\nthat. But to officially say it out loud felt different somehow. It felt more\nvulnerable and a part of Tony was terrified that Steve was only seconds from\nturning around and declaring that the night before had been a huge mistake. So\nlike always, he ran. Not far, only into the next room. But he\u2019d still gotten\nout of there as quickly as possible. And now he was sitting in a cab, mere\ninches away from Steve. Neither of them said a word. Tony glanced at Peter who\nwas sitting on Steve\u2019s lap, looking back and forth between them both. The cab\npulled up to the compound, Tony paid and they got out. Tony looked to Steve to\nfind Steve was already watching him.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Rogers?\u201d Tony hated how much it sounded like he didn\u2019t\ncare. He knew this looked bad and he knew it was a defense mechanism. He didn\u2019t\nwant walls up when it came to Steve, but some old habits simply die hard.<br>\n\u201cAre we going to go in there and pretend like last night didn\u2019t\nhappen?\u201d Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.<br>\n\u201cWhat do you want exactly Steve?\u201d Tony asked, he didn\u2019t want to say\nor do the wrong thing.<br>\n\u201cYou.\u201d Steve smirked and Tony swallowed.<br>\n\u201coh.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI understand that this is messy and complicated and there are a million\npeople out there who are going to think this is twisted and wrong and Maybe\nthis doesn\u2019t last. But it\u2019s here now and I love you and you love me and that\u2019s\nall that matters to me now. So I want\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0Tony.\u201d It sent\nthe warm and fuzzies through Tony\u2019s body. He was wanted, he was loved, he had\nbeen chosen. And simply knowing that made Tony\u2019s heart swell, so he crossed the\nspace between them and crashed his lips against Steve\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cWhy are you so perfect?\u201d he asked as he pulled back, leaning his\nforehead against Steve\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Steve whispered and Tony grinned.<br>\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Tony whispered and Steve grinned. Then hand in\nhand, they entered the avengers compound. Together.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt like Steve was in a dream, like none of\nthis was real. It couldn\u2019t possibly be real. This couldn\u2019t be happening to him.\nBut it was real, his life had fallen perfectly together. And it was all because\nof the little boy in his arms.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou are a miracle.\u201d Steve told Peter as they entered Bruce\u2019s\nlab.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Bruce asked and Steve felt like he was the\nluckiest person alive.<br>\n\u201cGood.\u201d He murmured and sat down. He sat through all the tests,\nwatched as Bruce checked on Peter. But when Bruce investigated some of Steve\u2019s\nbroken ribs, he frowned.<br>\n\u201cThese have gotten worse.\u201d He murmured and Steve\u2019s heart rate sped\nup. Just a little.<br>\n\u201cBeen doing strenuous exercise Steve?\u201d Nat said from the doorway. Steve\ncouldn\u2019t stop the blush, he simply looked down at his hands.<br>\n\u201cA couple weeks rest won\u2019t hurt Steve. You need to heal first.\u201d Bruce\ntold him and Steve nodded his head.<br>\n\u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get some coffee, want anything?\u201d Bruce asked. Both Steve\nand Natasha shook their heads. The second Bruce was out the door, Natasha\npunched his arm.<br>\n\u201cOw!\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about you and Tony?\u201d she demanded and Steve\nrubbed the spot she had hit.<br>\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he demanded.<br>\n\u201cI figured it out at the hospital, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut and sighed.<br>\n\u201cIt was all so new, I guess we just sort of wanted to stay in our own\nlittle happy bubble before telling everyone.\u201d Steve shrugged and Nat was\nscowling.<br>\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not everyone.\u201d She said in a small voice.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI was going to tell you first anyway.\u201d Steve told her and she nodded\nher head.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou better have.\u201d She told him and Steve grinned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI told him I love him.\u201d Nat\u2019s eyes widened and Steve looked at Peter,\nat his son.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cAnd what did Tony say?\u201d She demanded and Steve couldn\u2019t stop the\ngrin.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHe told me he loved me.\u201d Even Nat smiled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you two.\u201d She told him and Steve nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds for us and for all we know Tony and I\ncould break up tomorrow. But this feels good and it feels right and I can\npicture a future with Tony.\u201d Steve explained and Nat nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGood. You and Stark deserve to be happy.\u201d She told you and he\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThanks Nat. You deserve to be happy too.\u201d She rolled her eyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cMy standards are too high.\u201d She told him dryly and Steve couldn\u2019t\nhelp but raise an eyebrow.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cToo high or is it simply that you\u2019ve already found the person?\u201d Steve\nasked and she glared at him.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWe already have had this discussion Steve.\u201d She said in a voice that\nmade Steve rethink pursuing this conversation.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cBut you\u2019d be happy with-\u201d she squeezed her eyes shut.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHe has a girlfriend.\u201d She said at long last and Steve\u2019s eyes\nwidened.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry-\u201d<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Laura\u2019s nice. She\u2019s good for Clint.\u201d But Steve could see\nthe pain in Nat\u2019s eyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk about it.\u201d She\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThanks Steve. And you shouldn\u2019t be training when you\u2019re injured.\u201d Nat\nscolded and Steve smirked.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWho said I was training?\u201d He asked and she groaned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d And Steve couldn\u2019t help but grin. Peter\nwas his. Tony Stark was his. He had everything he could have ever wanted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly Tony and Steve let the avengers know they\nwere together. Most people had already accepted that idea months ago which had\nsurprised Tony. But everyone had simply decided that they\u2019d fall in love once\nthey had adopted Peter. It was nice that they all approved, but Tony wouldn\u2019t\nhave cared even if they hadn\u2019t approved. He loved Steve and Steve was his and\nthat was all that mattered. A part of Tony kept waiting for him to wake up. To\nfind out this was all a dream. He\u2019d be on that awful couch and none of this\nwould have happened. Maybe Steve chose Bucky. Maybe none of this was real. But\neach time Steve hugged him or kissed him or said he loved him, it hit Tony that\nthis was his reality. And it was the best feeling in the whole damn\nworld.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off and Steve looked up at him.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou look ridiculous.\u201d Steve broke out laughing. Tony had recently\nbought him an apron that said\u00a0<i>hot stuff</i>. Tony meant is as a joke\nbut now Steve wore it every time he cooked.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought it through when you bought it for me then.\u201d Tony\ngroaned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cJust come sit with me and Peter. We can order pizza!\u201d Tony exclaimed\nand Steve chuckled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cIf you had your way we would have pizza every night.\u201d Tony\nshrugged.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a downside of that.\u201d Steve shook his head.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cPlay the movie, I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d Steve told him and Tony sighed. Peter\nwas playing with one of his toys, so Tony stood up and walked to the\nkitchen.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI feel bad.\u201d He murmured and watched Steve chop up a carrot.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGo watch the movie Tony.\u201d Instead Tony wrapped his arms around Steve\u2019s\nwaist, pressing his face into Steve\u2019s back.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI can help with dinner.\u201d He knew Steve was grinning, Tony was\ngrinning himself.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou will be nothing but a distraction.\u201d Steve told him gently.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cA distraction? Do I distract you Steve?\u201d Tony asked and Steve\nchuckled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGo watch the movie Tony. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d With a heavy sigh Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOkay. But give me a kiss first.\u201d So Steve turned in his arms and\npressed his lips against Tony\u2019s.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cNow go watch the movie so I can make dinner.\u201d Steve murmured and Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cAlright Rogers.\u201d\n\n\n\n<br></p>",

He was loved. Someone else\non this damn planet loved him and of all people, it was Steve. Steven Grant\nRogers had fallen in love with Anthony Edward Stark and that in itself was a\nfucking miracle. Steve had chosen Tony and had fallen in love with him and\nwants to raise Peter with him.<br>\n\u201cSometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth Rogers. But these\npast couple months with you and Peter have been the best of my life and I guess\nsomewhere along the way I fell in love with you too.\u201d Tony confessed and Steve\u2019s\neyes widened.<br>\n\u201cReally?\u201d he asked and Tony rolled his eyes.<br>\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to drive me insane Rogers.\u201d Tony muttered and crossed\nthe distance to Steve, crashing his lips against Steve\u2019s. Steve responded\ninstantly and gripped the side of Tony\u2019s face. Steve\u2019s hands moved and pulled Tony\ninto his lap, and Tony kissed Steve\u2019s lips furiously, taking and taking and\ntaking. Steve was his, that was just the way it was. He and Steve belonged\ntogether. Steve finally pulled back and leaned his forehead against Tony\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cEasy, easy.\u201d He breathed and Tony smirked.<br>\n\u201cEasy has never been my style Steve.\u201d He murmured and kissed Steve\u2019s\nneck, claiming him as his own. Steve moaned and just hearing that sound sent\nshivers through Tony\u2019s body. Steve\u2019s hands slid down to Tony\u2019s ass and Tony\nrocked into Steve, causing the blonde to moan even louder this time.<br>\n\u201cAre you sure Steve?\u201d Tony asked and Steve nodded.<br>\n\u201cAbsolutely positive.\u201d And then Steve brought his lips against Tony\u2019s,\nkissing him and Tony couldn\u2019t help but smile against his lips. Tony rocked his\nhips again and he was relieved Peter was with May.\u00a0<br>\n\u201c<i>Tony</i>.\u201d Steve groaned and Tony smirked. He loved knowing he\nhad this effect on Steve.<br>\n\u201cYeah Cap?\u201d Tony asked and something darkened in Steve\u2019s eyes. He\ncrashed his lips against Tony\u2019s and Tony\u2019s fingers entangled themselves in Steve\u2019s\nhair. Soon Steve was lifting Tony up and carrying him towards Steve\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve and Tony were simply gazing into one\nanother\u2019s eyes in blissful silence. The sun was rising and everything had\nturned into a golden haze as the light filtered in through the window.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cSo now what?\u201d Steve asked, his voice rough. Steve had decided to\nfinally break the silence. Tony looked away and that simple act alone was\nenough to make Steve wish he\u2019d never said anything.<br>\n\u201cNow we should probably get up and get ready for the day. I\u2019ve got a\nmeeting with Fury and Bruce wants to check up on you.\u201d Tony said, rolling\nover and getting out of Steve\u2019s bed. Steve watched him, a slight frown on his\nface and then Tony left his room. With a sigh, Steve rolled onto his back and\nstared up at the ceiling. Great. After declaring their love for one another and\nfor what came\u00a0<i>after</i>\u00a0that, Steve was supposed to get a check up\nfrom Bruce and Tony was going to have a meeting with Fury. Like any other,\nboring, normal and completely-average day. Great.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTony knew exactly what Steve had been asking in\nbed this morning. But he wasn\u2019t ready to have that discussion. He and Steve\nwere practically together already, and the night before had only solidified\nthat. But to officially say it out loud felt different somehow. It felt more\nvulnerable and a part of Tony was terrified that Steve was only seconds from\nturning around and declaring that the night before had been a huge mistake. So\nlike always, he ran. Not far, only into the next room. But he\u2019d still gotten\nout of there as quickly as possible. And now he was sitting in a cab, mere\ninches away from Steve. Neither of them said a word. Tony glanced at Peter who\nwas sitting on Steve\u2019s lap, looking back and forth between them both. The cab\npulled up to the compound, Tony paid and they got out. Tony looked to Steve to\nfind Steve was already watching him.<br>\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up Rogers?\u201d Tony hated how much it sounded like he didn\u2019t\ncare. He knew this looked bad and he knew it was a defense mechanism. He didn\u2019t\nwant walls up when it came to Steve, but some old habits simply die hard.<br>\n\u201cAre we going to go in there and pretend like last night didn\u2019t\nhappen?\u201d Steve asked and Tony bit his lip.<br>\n\u201cWhat do you want exactly Steve?\u201d Tony asked, he didn\u2019t want to say\nor do the wrong thing.<br>\n\u201cYou.\u201d Steve smirked and Tony swallowed.<br>\n\u201coh.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI understand that this is messy and complicated and there are a million\npeople out there who are going to think this is twisted and wrong and Maybe\nthis doesn\u2019t last. But it\u2019s here now and I love you and you love me and that\u2019s\nall that matters to me now. So I want\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0Tony.\u201d It sent\nthe warm and fuzzies through Tony\u2019s body. He was wanted, he was loved, he had\nbeen chosen. And simply knowing that made Tony\u2019s heart swell, so he crossed the\nspace between them and crashed his lips against Steve\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cWhy are you so perfect?\u201d he asked as he pulled back, leaning his\nforehead against Steve\u2019s.<br>\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Steve whispered and Tony grinned.<br>\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d Tony whispered and Steve grinned. Then hand in\nhand, they entered the avengers compound. Together.\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt like Steve was in a dream, like none of\nthis was real. It couldn\u2019t possibly be real. This couldn\u2019t be happening to him.\nBut it was real, his life had fallen perfectly together. And it was all because\nof the little boy in his arms.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou are a miracle.\u201d Steve told Peter as they entered Bruce\u2019s\nlab.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Bruce asked and Steve felt like he was the\nluckiest person alive.<br>\n\u201cGood.\u201d He murmured and sat down. He sat through all the tests,\nwatched as Bruce checked on Peter. But when Bruce investigated some of Steve\u2019s\nbroken ribs, he frowned.<br>\n\u201cThese have gotten worse.\u201d He murmured and Steve\u2019s heart rate sped\nup. Just a little.<br>\n\u201cBeen doing strenuous exercise Steve?\u201d Nat said from the doorway. Steve\ncouldn\u2019t stop the blush, he simply looked down at his hands.<br>\n\u201cA couple weeks rest won\u2019t hurt Steve. You need to heal first.\u201d Bruce\ntold him and Steve nodded his head.<br>\n\u201cAlright.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get some coffee, want anything?\u201d Bruce asked. Both Steve\nand Natasha shook their heads. The second Bruce was out the door, Natasha\npunched his arm.<br>\n\u201cOw!\u201d<br>\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about you and Tony?\u201d she demanded and Steve\nrubbed the spot she had hit.<br>\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he demanded.<br>\n\u201cI figured it out at the hospital, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut and sighed.<br>\n\u201cIt was all so new, I guess we just sort of wanted to stay in our own\nlittle happy bubble before telling everyone.\u201d Steve shrugged and Nat was\nscowling.<br>\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not everyone.\u201d She said in a small voice.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI was going to tell you first anyway.\u201d Steve told her and she nodded\nher head.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou better have.\u201d She told him and Steve grinned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI told him I love him.\u201d Nat\u2019s eyes widened and Steve looked at Peter,\nat his son.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cAnd what did Tony say?\u201d She demanded and Steve couldn\u2019t stop the\ngrin.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHe told me he loved me.\u201d Even Nat smiled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for you two.\u201d She told him and Steve nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds for us and for all we know Tony and I\ncould break up tomorrow. But this feels good and it feels right and I can\npicture a future with Tony.\u201d Steve explained and Nat nodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGood. You and Stark deserve to be happy.\u201d She told you and he\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThanks Nat. You deserve to be happy too.\u201d She rolled her eyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cMy standards are too high.\u201d She told him dryly and Steve couldn\u2019t\nhelp but raise an eyebrow.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cToo high or is it simply that you\u2019ve already found the person?\u201d Steve\nasked and she glared at him.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWe already have had this discussion Steve.\u201d She said in a voice that\nmade Steve rethink pursuing this conversation.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cBut you\u2019d be happy with-\u201d she squeezed her eyes shut.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cHe has a girlfriend.\u201d She said at long last and Steve\u2019s eyes\nwidened.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry-\u201d<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Laura\u2019s nice. She\u2019s good for Clint.\u201d But Steve could see\nthe pain in Nat\u2019s eyes.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk about it.\u201d She\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cThanks Steve. And you shouldn\u2019t be training when you\u2019re injured.\u201d Nat\nscolded and Steve smirked.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cWho said I was training?\u201d He asked and she groaned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need to know that.\u201d And Steve couldn\u2019t help but grin. Peter\nwas his. Tony Stark was his. He had everything he could have ever wanted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n<br></p><hr><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly Tony and Steve let the avengers know they\nwere together. Most people had already accepted that idea months ago which had\nsurprised Tony. But everyone had simply decided that they\u2019d fall in love once\nthey had adopted Peter. It was nice that they all approved, but Tony wouldn\u2019t\nhave cared even if they hadn\u2019t approved. He loved Steve and Steve was his and\nthat was all that mattered. A part of Tony kept waiting for him to wake up. To\nfind out this was all a dream. He\u2019d be on that awful couch and none of this\nwould have happened. Maybe Steve chose Bucky. Maybe none of this was real. But\neach time Steve hugged him or kissed him or said he loved him, it hit Tony that\nthis was his reality. And it was the best feeling in the whole damn\nworld.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d Tony trailed off and Steve looked up at him.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\n\u201cYou look ridiculous.\u201d Steve broke out laughing. Tony had recently\nbought him an apron that said\u00a0<i>hot stuff</i>. Tony meant is as a joke\nbut now Steve wore it every time he cooked.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought it through when you bought it for me then.\u201d Tony\ngroaned.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cJust come sit with me and Peter. We can order pizza!\u201d Tony exclaimed\nand Steve chuckled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cIf you had your way we would have pizza every night.\u201d Tony\nshrugged.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a downside of that.\u201d Steve shook his head.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cPlay the movie, I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d Steve told him and Tony sighed. Peter\nwas playing with one of his toys, so Tony stood up and walked to the\nkitchen.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI feel bad.\u201d He murmured and watched Steve chop up a carrot.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGo watch the movie Tony.\u201d Instead Tony wrapped his arms around Steve\u2019s\nwaist, pressing his face into Steve\u2019s back.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cI can help with dinner.\u201d He knew Steve was grinning, Tony was\ngrinning himself.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cYou will be nothing but a distraction.\u201d Steve told him gently.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cA distraction? Do I distract you Steve?\u201d Tony asked and Steve\nchuckled.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cGo watch the movie Tony. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d With a heavy sigh Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cOkay. But give me a kiss first.\u201d So Steve turned in his arms and\npressed his lips against Tony\u2019s.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cNow go watch the movie so I can make dinner.\u201d Steve murmured and Tony\nnodded.\u00a0<br>\n\u201cAlright Rogers.\u201d\n\n\n\n<br></p>",

Steve\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop the blush, he simply looked down at his hands.<br />\n&ldquo;A couple weeks rest won&rsquo;t hurt Steve. You need to heal first.&rdquo; Bruce\ntold him and Steve nodded his head.<br />\n&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get some coffee, want anything?&rdquo; Bruce asked. Both Steve\nand Natasha shook their heads. The second Bruce was out the door, Natasha\npunched his arm.<br />\n&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about you and Tony?&rdquo; she demanded and Steve\nrubbed the spot she had hit.<br />\n&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he demanded.<br />\n&ldquo;I figured it out at the hospital, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Steve\nsqueezed his eyes shut and sighed.<br />\n&ldquo;It was all so new, I guess we just sort of wanted to stay in our own\nlittle happy bubble before telling everyone.&rdquo; Steve shrugged and Nat was\nscowling.<br />\n&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not everyone.&rdquo; She said in a small voice.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I was going to tell you first anyway.&rdquo; Steve told her and she nodded\nher head.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You better have.&rdquo; She told him and Steve grinned.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I told him I love him.&rdquo; Nat&rsquo;s eyes widened and Steve looked at Peter,\nat his son.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;And what did Tony say?&rdquo; She demanded and Steve couldn&rsquo;t stop the\ngrin.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;He told me he loved me.&rdquo; Even Nat smiled.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you two.&rdquo; She told him and Steve nodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for us and for all we know Tony and I\ncould break up tomorrow. But this feels good and it feels right and I can\npicture a future with Tony.&rdquo; Steve explained and Nat nodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Good. You and Stark deserve to be happy.&rdquo; She told you and he\nnodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Thanks Nat. You deserve to be happy too.&rdquo; She rolled her eyes.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;My standards are too high.&rdquo; She told him dryly and Steve couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but raise an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Too high or is it simply that you&rsquo;ve already found the person?&rdquo; Steve\nasked and she glared at him.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;We already have had this discussion Steve.&rdquo; She said in a voice that\nmade Steve rethink pursuing this conversation.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d be happy with-&rdquo; she squeezed her eyes shut.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;He has a girlfriend.&rdquo; She said at long last and Steve&rsquo;s eyes\nwidened.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry-&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Laura&rsquo;s nice. She&rsquo;s good for Clint.&rdquo; But Steve could see\nthe pain in Nat&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m here if you ever want to talk about it.&rdquo; She\nnodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Thanks Steve. And you shouldn&rsquo;t be training when you&rsquo;re injured.&rdquo; Nat\nscolded and Steve smirked.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Who said I was training?&rdquo; He asked and she groaned.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need to know that.&rdquo; And Steve couldn&rsquo;t help but grin. Peter\nwas his. Tony Stark was his. He had everything he could have ever wanted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<br /></p><hr /><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly Tony and Steve let the avengers know they\nwere together. Most people had already accepted that idea months ago which had\nsurprised Tony. But everyone had simply decided that they&rsquo;d fall in love once\nthey had adopted Peter. It was nice that they all approved, but Tony wouldn&rsquo;t\nhave cared even if they hadn&rsquo;t approved. He loved Steve and Steve was his and\nthat was all that mattered. A part of Tony kept waiting for him to wake up. To\nfind out this was all a dream. He&rsquo;d be on that awful couch and none of this\nwould have happened. Maybe Steve chose Bucky. Maybe none of this was real. But\neach time Steve hugged him or kissed him or said he loved him, it hit Tony that\nthis was his reality. And it was the best feeling in the whole damn\nworld.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Steve&hellip;&rdquo; Tony trailed off and Steve looked up at him.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;<br />\n&ldquo;You look ridiculous.&rdquo; Steve broke out laughing. Tony had recently\nbought him an apron that said&nbsp;<i>hot stuff</i>. Tony meant is as a joke\nbut now Steve wore it every time he cooked.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve thought it through when you bought it for me then.&rdquo; Tony\ngroaned.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Just come sit with me and Peter. We can order pizza!&rdquo; Tony exclaimed\nand Steve chuckled.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;If you had your way we would have pizza every night.&rdquo; Tony\nshrugged.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a downside of that.&rdquo; Steve shook his head.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Play the movie, I&rsquo;ll make dinner.&rdquo; Steve told him and Tony sighed. Peter\nwas playing with one of his toys, so Tony stood up and walked to the\nkitchen.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I feel bad.&rdquo; He murmured and watched Steve chop up a carrot.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Go watch the movie Tony.&rdquo; Instead Tony wrapped his arms around Steve&rsquo;s\nwaist, pressing his face into Steve&rsquo;s back.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;I can help with dinner.&rdquo; He knew Steve was grinning, Tony was\ngrinning himself.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You will be nothing but a distraction.&rdquo; Steve told him gently.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;A distraction? Do I distract you Steve?&rdquo; Tony asked and Steve\nchuckled.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Go watch the movie Tony. I&rsquo;ll be there soon.&rdquo; With a heavy sigh Tony\nnodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Okay. But give me a kiss first.&rdquo; So Steve turned in his arms and\npressed his lips against Tony&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Now go watch the movie so I can make dinner.&rdquo; Steve murmured and Tony\nnodded.&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Alright Rogers.&rdquo;\n\n\n\n<br /></p>",

But now that Peter is here,Steve and Tony both feel protective over him. It doesn&rsquo;t help that Peter hates everyone other than Steve and tony. But as Steve and tony raise Peter, they start to fall for one another. Will this superfamily work out or will it all turn to hell?<br />A/N: My exams are officially over! i had my last exam today, so i put this together for you all.
