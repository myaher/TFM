Possessors of pear wands are, in my experience, usually popular and well-respected. I do not know of a single instance where a pear wand has been discovered in the possession of a Dark witch or wizard.&nbsp;<br /></i></p><p><i>\n\nAs a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p><i><br /></i></p><p><b>Patronus: macaw<br /></b></p><ul><li><i>Colorful</i></li><li><i>Loud</i></li><li><i>Constantly talking, singing or both</i></li><li><i>Will violently defend/guard her mate if deemed necessary</i></li></ul><p><i><br /></i></p><p><b>Tina Belcher ~</b></p><p><b>House: Gryffindor</b></p><blockquote><p><i>She read her erotic friend-fiction aloud in school, took charge of the situation when locked in a morgue with her younger siblings, climbed a mountain on her own, studied martial arts, braved water balloons full of pee to rescue some kids, devised a plan to out a Scout troop mole, graffiti&rsquo;d and then un-graffiti&rsquo;s the Land Ship, overcame terrible stage fright, and she flirts with every boy and attempts to befriend every girl no matter how much she&rsquo;s rejected.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s not bravery I don&rsquo;t know what is.&nbsp; And she tends to not make great decisions/think with her heart rather than her head,&nbsp; be a bit impulsive, hot-tempered and a show-off, and stands up to anyone, even her family and her teachers, for what she believes in, even if it makes her unpopular.</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Wand: Black walnut with a unicorn hair core </b>(my first instinct was ebony wood though; both are perfect for Tina)</p><blockquote><p><i>[Black walnut wood] has one pronounced quirk, which is that it is abnormally attuned to inner conflict, and loses power dramatically if its possessor practises any form of self-deception. If the witch or wizard is unable or unwilling to be honest with themselves or others, the wand often fails to perform adequately and must be matched with a new owner if it is to regain its former prowess. Paired with a sincere, self-aware owner, however, it becomes one of the most loyal and impressive wands of all, with a particular flair in all kinds of charmwork.</i></p><p><i>[Wands with unicorn cores] are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard&hellip;they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may &lsquo;die&rsquo; and need replacing.&nbsp; - Garrick Ollivander</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Patronus: crow</b></p><ul><li><i>A crow appeared to Tina at the moment of her nature-piphany.&nbsp; That seems like a clear message.</i></li></ul><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><b>Gene Belcher ~&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>House: Hufflepuff</b></p><blockquote><p><i>I mean&hellip;come on. &nbsp;Where else could Gene be?&nbsp; Despite his love for showing off and attention, which admittedly is very Gryffindor, Gene cares the most about family, music and food.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s loyal to a fault - even when he&rsquo;s angry enough with his best friend to intentionally give him diarrhea, he can&rsquo;t go through with it - looks out for the little guy, is quirky, and would definitely prefer a dorm right next to the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Wand: ebony wood with a dragon heartstring core</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\n\nEbony is happiest in the hand of those with the courage to be themselves. Frequently non-conformist, highly individual or comfortable with the status of outsider&hellip;the ebony wand&rsquo;s perfect match is one who will hold fast to his or her beliefs, no matter what the external pressure, and will not be swayed lightly from their purpose.\n\n</i><br /></p><p><i>\n\nAs a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells.&nbsp; - Garrick Ollivander<br /></i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Patronus: boxer</b></p><ul><li><i>Often confused</i></li><li><i>Baffled by/fascinated with simple everyday objects</i></li><li><i>Will try to eat anything</i></li><li><i>Farts</i></li><li><i>Not stupid, but would rather have fun than act smart</i></li><li><i>Food motivated&nbsp;</i></li><li><i>Zero attention span</i></li><li><i>Very attached to family and prone to separation anxiety</i></li><li><i>Clumsy</i></li></ul><p><i><br /></i></p><p><b>Louise Belcher ~&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>House: Slytherin</b></p><blockquote><p><i>The Slytherin we all wanted but never got; a heart and a conscience, but will use any means to get their way.&nbsp; Would rather be feared than liked.</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Wand: Yew wood with a dragon heartstring core</b></p><blockquote><p><i>Yew wands are among the rarer kinds, and their ideal matches are likewise unusual, and occasionally notorious. The wand of yew is reputed to endow its possessor with the power of life and death, which might, of course, be said of all wands; and yet yew retains a particularly dark and fearsome reputation in the spheres of duelling and all curses. However, it is untrue to say (as those unlearned in wandlore often do) that those who use yew wands are more likely to be attracted to the Dark Arts than another. The witch or wizard best suited to a yew wand might equally prove a fierce protector of others. Wands hewn from these most long-lived trees have been found in the possession of heroes quite as often as of villains. Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owner&rsquo;s grave. What is certain, in my experience, is that the yew wand never chooses either a mediocre or a timid owner.</i></p><p><i>As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant spells.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The dragon wand tends to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental. - Garrick Ollivander</i></p></blockquote><p><br /></p><p><b>Patronus: honey badger</b></p><ul><li><i>Tough as nails</i></li><li><i>Scares apex predators literally 17x its size</i></li><li><i>Looks adorable</i></li><li><i>Will fuck you up</i></li><li><i>Prefers to act scary rather than inflict actual harm</i></li><li><i>But will fuck you up</i></li><li><i>Will pick fights when in the mood</i></li><li><i>Prefers to be left alone</i></li><li><i>Never gives up</i></li></ul></p>",
