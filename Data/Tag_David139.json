I had made a post earlier about how the song actually reflects the Doctor quite well and even though we don\u2019t actually hear what the Doctor tells Rose on the beach, this song does. It wasn&rsquo;t long enough though, and some people wanted more so, here\u2019s take two.\u00a0In this essay I will-</p><!-- more --><p>Verse 1</p><p>Well, I&rsquo;ve roamed about this Earth<br/>With just a suitcase in my hand<br/>And I&rsquo;ve met some bug-eyed Joes<br/>I&rsquo;ve met the blessed I&rsquo;ve met the damned\u00a0<br/>But of all the strange, strange creatures<br/>In the air, at sea, on land<br/>Oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl<br/>I love you, you understand<br/><br/></p><p>We start the song with words that speak of a traveller who has gone all over the world and is just left with his suitcase. Sound familiar? Just a little? It should. Because this traveller is none other than the Doctor.\u00a0</p><p>The whole show is about his travels and the people he meets and songs aren\u2019t random in television, or <i>good </i>television for that matter. They\u2019re carefully picked and the fact that this song plays when the camera focuses on the Doctor hints that it\u2019s about him. \u00a0</p><p>To go even further, he\u2019s the last of his kind and the TARDIS, or the suitcase, is all he has left.\u00a0He\u2019s met\u00a0\u201cthe blessed\u201d and\u00a0\u201cthe damned\u201d. All different kinds of people, but also, gods and devils e.g The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>But, Sab, strange creatures? How does that relate to the Doctor?</p><p>Good question. The answer?</p><p>Also, The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>In that episode, The Doctor is faced with the actual devil and when he does he has this super long monologue. Long, but super important. He talks about how he\u2019s met so many gods in his lifetime and seen them with his own eyes. He knows they exist; a question that most humans contemplate today.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c87dadb3de7f7431f6708a3818f5962/tumblr_inline_pmmrbjoyuB1tc7rqp_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/></figure><p>He goes on to say how even though he&rsquo;s actually <i>seen</i>\u00a0all of these gods, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t believe in any of them. Who does he believe in then? Rose Tyler. <i>Yeah, we know, Sab, why are you telling us something we already know?</i> Well, because this exact monologue is also described in the song&hellip;just much simpler:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met the blessed\u00a0I&rsquo;ve met the damned, But of all the strange, strange creatures, in the air, in the sea, on land, oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl, I love you, you understand\u201d</p><p>It can best be explained as this: Blessed and damned-gods and devils. <i>But out of all</i>- besides the numerous gods and devils. My girl-Rose Tyler. I love you- I <i>believe </i>in her. \u00a0</p><p>Not only can this line refer to the monologue, but it could also just refer to all of the companions the Doctor has met, which I will go more in depth with when I get to verse 3.\u00a0</p><p>But for now, I\u2019m gonna skip the chorus and go straight to the second verse because that\u2019s where the song begins in the actual scene and really takes a look at the doctor\u2019s psyche.\u00a0</p><p>Verse 2:\u00a0</p><p>I have wandered, I have rambled<br/>I have crossed this crowded sphere<br/>And I&rsquo;ve seen a mess of problems<br/>That I long to disappear<br/>And all I have&rsquo;s this anguished heart<br/>For you have vanished too<br/>Oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl<br/>Just what is this man to do?<br/></p><p>Again, it speaks of a man who\u2019s travelled which is established to be The Doctor. \u00a0It\u2019s confirmed with the next line:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve seen a mess of problems, that I long to disappear\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>On his travels, the Doctor\u2019s goal is always to solve what is wrong with that particular place. Sometimes he\u2019s meant to go there specifically because of the problem, other times he just happens to be there when bad things happen, but whatever the case, he never leaves without fixing it. However, he <i>does</i>\u00a0leave, or\u00a0\u201cdisappear\u201d,\u00a0when the cleaning up needs to be done.\u00a0</p><p>Not only can this refer to physical problems, but emotional ones too. The Doctor has extreme emotional baggage, Regret, loss, pain, and his whole character development is revolved around trying to heal from it. Specifically, in Ten\u2019s case, the pain of losing Rose to the parallel world.\u00a0</p><p>This reception happens and the song plays just after he\u2019s lost her. More importantly, this verse plays just before he has a flashback with her in it. This can all be traced back to the line\u00a0\u201cAnd all I have\u2019s this anguished heart, for you have vanished too,\u201d.</p><p>The Doctor is constantly left with loss and regret, and this is only heightened when he loses Rose. She made him better; helped him heal. But, now that she\u2019s gone, all he\u2019s left with are the problems and an\u00a0\u201canguished heart\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Verse 3:\u00a0</p><p>Well, you took me in<br/>You stole my heart<br/>I cannot roam no more<br/>Because love, it stays within you<br/>It doesn&rsquo;t wash up on a shore<br/>And a fighting man forgets each cut<br/>Each knock, each bruise, each fall<br/>But a fighting man cannot forget<br/>Why his love don&rsquo;t roam no more<br/></p><p>Now this is the verse that really gives us a look into the Doctor\u2019s heart. What\u2019s super important about this verse is that\u00a0it\u2019s what plays when The Doctor has his flashback of Rose. The line\u00a0\u201cyou stole my heart\u201d coincides with the beginning of the flashback and the\u00a0<i>exact </i>moment that the Doctor catches Rose.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"doctorwhogeneration:9-nInUnumgNhagz377xG1A:ZVruyl2Vo88pg\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4ec9c7678013fbbe0a37f4d7ecaf121/tumblr_p54xl1SL5I1u4r6fqo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\"/></figure><p>Call it meta, or literal, or whatever you want, but this\u00a0doesn\u2019t happen just by chance. In fact, the song\u2019s been playing since way before the flashback happens which shows that this verse is meant to be playing when the flashback happens.\u00a0</p><p>What does it actually mean, then? Well, just as the lyric says. Rose Tyler stole the\u00a0Doctor\u2019s heart, er, hearts that is. The fact that he catches her at the exact same moment says it all; The Doctor loves Rose Tyler.\u00a0</p><p>As for the whole\u00a0\u201cI cannot roam anymore\u201d, well, that goes back to what I was saying about the companions in the first verse.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s met so many people over his 900 years of existence and he\u2019s travelled with many, <i>many</i>, companions. Sarah Jane Smith, Martha Jones, Donna Noble. The list goes on. And he\u2019s cared about them all. All in different ways.</p><p>But the thing with all the other companions, is that he was perfectly fine leaving them. He knew it was going to happen at some point. He wasn\u2019t necessarily okay with it, but he was content. It was just what happened. He was a traveller and he\u00a0didn\u2019t stay in one place or with one person too long.\u00a0</p><p>With Rose, though, it was different. She stole his heart. This was established in the first verse. He\u2019s met all these strange creatures, or all these different companions, but it was Rose that he loved. He couldn&rsquo;t just leave her, hence the lyrics\u00a0\u201cI cannot roam no more, because love stays within you, it doesn\u2019t wash up on a shore\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Rose stayed with him, even though she wasn\u2019t physically there. She stole his heart and with her gone, he didn\u2019t really have one. He was just left with all this turmoil, unable to just replace her with another companion, like he would do with others.\u00a0</p><p>And not only does the line\u00a0\u201cit\u00a0doesn\u2019t wash up on a shore\u201d refer to The Doctor\u2019s inner psyche, but it could also refer to the actual beach that he left Rose on; Bad Wolf Bay. While an actual duplicate of him showed up on the shore, it wasn\u2019t him. The duplicate had the memories and the love for Rose, but he himself wasn\u2019t physically there. It was the duplicate that was.\u00a0</p><p><i>But Sab, we don\u2019t know the Doctor loved Rose for certain, he\u2019s never said it.</i></p><p>uh-huh. Well, if you really need me to tell you, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re watching the same show, but for good measures, here\u2019s the chorus.\u00a0</p><p>chorus<br/></p><p>Reel me in, my precious girl<br/>Come on, take me home<br/>My body&rsquo;s tired of traveling<br/>And my heart don&rsquo;t wish to roam</p><p>This is what plays just before the Doctor has his flashback. As he\u2019s watching all of the people on the dance floor, his eyes fixate on this one specific couple, the woman having blonde hair, just like Rose did. He fixates on this couple just after the lines\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy body\u2019s tired of traveling, and my heart don\u2019t wish to roam\u201d.</p><p>It\u2019s also important to note that the man dips the woman while dancing, and \u201creels\u201d her in, which is when the flashback of Rose begins in which a similar thing happens. This is important because again, it solidifies that this song is about the Doctor and Rose.\u00a0</p><p>So, what about the rest of the chorus, then? Well,\u00a0it\u2019s basically all been said. The Doctor has had all of these different companions which whom he loves and cherishes. However, the chorus adds this idea that he doesn\u2019t want to, or physically can&rsquo;t, be with all those companions anymore.</p><p>All he wants is to live a life where he can grow old like humans and not have to live with all of this constant regret and pain that comes with the passing of time. He just wants to settle down, have a more permanent life. He\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to do it alone, though. No, he wants to live a permanent life with Rose.</p><p>\u201cMy precious girl, come on, take me home\u201d says it all. He wants to be the one standing on that beach. He wants to be in Pete\u2019s world with Rose. He\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to travel with all of these different people anymore. He only wants <i>her.\u00a0</i></p><p>And\u00a0that\u2019s because the Doctor <i>loves </i>Rose Tyler.\u00a0</p><p>If you still don\u2019t believe me, maybe you\u2019ll believe Murray Gold, who composed the soundtrack:</p><p>\u201cIn the 2006 special\u00a0\u201cThe Runaway Bride\u201d we needed <a href=\"https://genius.com/Murray-gold-love-dont-roam-lyrics\">a song</a> that reflected the Doctor\u2019s inner thoughts whilst also being something you could imagine a crowd at a wedding dancing to. The third verse is especially inspired by David Tennant. The song is as much his as Song for Ten was before\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>I know what you must be thinking now. <i>Sab, why go through all that trouble when you could\u2019ve literally just posted this quote?</i> I could\u2019ve, but what\u2019s the fun in that?</p>",

Sound familiar? Just a little? It should. Because this traveller is none other than the Doctor.\u00a0</p><p>The whole show is about his travels and the people he meets and songs aren\u2019t random in television, or <i>good </i>television for that matter. They\u2019re carefully picked and the fact that this song plays when the camera focuses on the Doctor hints that it\u2019s about him. \u00a0</p><p>To go even further, he\u2019s the last of his kind and the TARDIS, or the suitcase, is all he has left.\u00a0He\u2019s met\u00a0\u201cthe blessed\u201d and\u00a0\u201cthe damned\u201d. All different kinds of people, but also, gods and devils e.g The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>But, Sab, strange creatures? How does that relate to the Doctor?</p><p>Good question. The answer?</p><p>Also, The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>In that episode, The Doctor is faced with the actual devil and when he does he has this super long monologue. Long, but super important. He talks about how he\u2019s met so many gods in his lifetime and seen them with his own eyes.

I had made a post earlier about how the song actually reflects the Doctor quite well and even though we don\u2019t actually hear what the Doctor tells Rose on the beach, this song does. It wasn\u2019t long enough though, and some people wanted more so, here\u2019s take two.\u00a0In this essay I will-</p>[[MORE]]<p>Verse 1</p><p>Well, I\u2019ve roamed about this Earth<br>With just a suitcase in my hand<br>And I\u2019ve met some bug-eyed Joes<br>I\u2019ve met the blessed I\u2019ve met the damned\u00a0<br>But of all the strange, strange creatures<br>In the air, at sea, on land<br>Oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl<br>I love you, you understand<br><br></p><p>We start the song with words that speak of a traveller who has gone all over the world and is just left with his suitcase. Sound familiar? Just a little? It should. Because this traveller is none other than the Doctor.\u00a0</p><p>The whole show is about his travels and the people he meets and songs aren\u2019t random in television, or <i>good </i>television for that matter. They\u2019re carefully picked and the fact that this song plays when the camera focuses on the Doctor hints that it\u2019s about him. \u00a0</p><p>To go even further, he\u2019s the last of his kind and the TARDIS, or the suitcase, is all he has left.\u00a0He\u2019s met\u00a0\u201cthe blessed\u201d and\u00a0\u201cthe damned\u201d. All different kinds of people, but also, gods and devils e.g The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>But, Sab, strange creatures? How does that relate to the Doctor?</p><p>Good question. The answer?</p><p>Also, The Satan Pit.\u00a0</p><p>In that episode, The Doctor is faced with the actual devil and when he does he has this super long monologue. Long, but super important. He talks about how he\u2019s met so many gods in his lifetime and seen them with his own eyes. He knows they exist; a question that most humans contemplate today.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"400\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c87dadb3de7f7431f6708a3818f5962/tumblr_inline_pmmrbjoyuB1tc7rqp_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"211\" data-orig-width=\"400\"></figure><p>He goes on to say how even though he\u2019s actually <i>seen</i>\u00a0all of these gods, he\u00a0doesn\u2019t believe in any of them. Who does he believe in then? Rose Tyler. <i>Yeah, we know, Sab, why are you telling us something we already know?</i> Well, because this exact monologue is also described in the song\u2026just much simpler:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met the blessed\u00a0I\u2019ve met the damned, But of all the strange, strange creatures, in the air, in the sea, on land, oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl, I love you, you understand\u201d</p><p>It can best be explained as this: Blessed and damned-gods and devils. <i>But out of all</i>- besides the numerous gods and devils. My girl-Rose Tyler. I love you- I <i>believe </i>in her. \u00a0</p><p>Not only can this line refer to the monologue, but it could also just refer to all of the companions the Doctor has met, which I will go more in depth with when I get to verse 3.\u00a0</p><p>But for now, I\u2019m gonna skip the chorus and go straight to the second verse because that\u2019s where the song begins in the actual scene and really takes a look at the doctor\u2019s psyche.\u00a0</p><p>Verse 2:\u00a0</p><p>I have wandered, I have rambled<br>I have crossed this crowded sphere<br>And I\u2019ve seen a mess of problems<br>That I long to disappear<br>And all I have\u2019s this anguished heart<br>For you have vanished too<br>Oh my girl, my girl, my precious girl<br>Just what is this man to do?<br></p><p>Again, it speaks of a man who\u2019s travelled which is established to be The Doctor. \u00a0It\u2019s confirmed with the next line:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a mess of problems, that I long to disappear\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>On his travels, the Doctor\u2019s goal is always to solve what is wrong with that particular place. Sometimes he\u2019s meant to go there specifically because of the problem, other times he just happens to be there when bad things happen, but whatever the case, he never leaves without fixing it. However, he <i>does</i>\u00a0leave, or\u00a0\u201cdisappear\u201d,\u00a0when the cleaning up needs to be done.\u00a0</p><p>Not only can this refer to physical problems, but emotional ones too. The Doctor has extreme emotional baggage, Regret, loss, pain, and his whole character development is revolved around trying to heal from it. Specifically, in Ten\u2019s case, the pain of losing Rose to the parallel world.\u00a0</p><p>This reception happens and the song plays just after he\u2019s lost her. More importantly, this verse plays just before he has a flashback with her in it. This can all be traced back to the line\u00a0\u201cAnd all I have\u2019s this anguished heart, for you have vanished too,\u201d.</p><p>The Doctor is constantly left with loss and regret, and this is only heightened when he loses Rose. She made him better; helped him heal. But, now that she\u2019s gone, all he\u2019s left with are the problems and an\u00a0\u201canguished heart\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Verse 3:\u00a0</p><p>Well, you took me in<br>You stole my heart<br>I cannot roam no more<br>Because love, it stays within you<br>It doesn\u2019t wash up on a shore<br>And a fighting man forgets each cut<br>Each knock, each bruise, each fall<br>But a fighting man cannot forget<br>Why his love don\u2019t roam no more<br></p><p>Now this is the verse that really gives us a look into the Doctor\u2019s heart. What\u2019s super important about this verse is that\u00a0it\u2019s what plays when The Doctor has his flashback of Rose. The line\u00a0\u201cyou stole my heart\u201d coincides with the beginning of the flashback and the\u00a0<i>exact </i>moment that the Doctor catches Rose.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"doctorwhogeneration:9-nInUnumgNhagz377xG1A:ZVruyl2Vo88pg\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4ec9c7678013fbbe0a37f4d7ecaf121/tumblr_p54xl1SL5I1u4r6fqo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"213\"></figure><p>Call it meta, or literal, or whatever you want, but this\u00a0doesn\u2019t happen just by chance. In fact, the song\u2019s been playing since way before the flashback happens which shows that this verse is meant to be playing when the flashback happens.\u00a0</p><p>What does it actually mean, then? Well, just as the lyric says. Rose Tyler stole the\u00a0Doctor\u2019s heart, er, hearts that is. The fact that he catches her at the exact same moment says it all; The Doctor loves Rose Tyler.\u00a0</p><p>As for the whole\u00a0\u201cI cannot roam anymore\u201d, well, that goes back to what I was saying about the companions in the first verse.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019s met so many people over his 900 years of existence and he\u2019s travelled with many, <i>many</i>, companions. Sarah Jane Smith, Martha Jones, Donna Noble. The list goes on. And he\u2019s cared about them all. All in different ways.</p><p>But the thing with all the other companions, is that he was perfectly fine leaving them. He knew it was going to happen at some point. He wasn\u2019t necessarily okay with it, but he was content. It was just what happened. He was a traveller and he\u00a0didn\u2019t stay in one place or with one person too long.\u00a0</p><p>With Rose, though, it was different. She stole his heart. This was established in the first verse. He\u2019s met all these strange creatures, or all these different companions, but it was Rose that he loved. He couldn\u2019t just leave her, hence the lyrics\u00a0\u201cI cannot roam no more, because love stays within you, it doesn\u2019t wash up on a shore\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Rose stayed with him, even though she wasn\u2019t physically there. She stole his heart and with her gone, he didn\u2019t really have one. He was just left with all this turmoil, unable to just replace her with another companion, like he would do with others.\u00a0</p><p>And not only does the line\u00a0\u201cit\u00a0doesn\u2019t wash up on a shore\u201d refer to The Doctor\u2019s inner psyche, but it could also refer to the actual beach that he left Rose on; Bad Wolf Bay. While an actual duplicate of him showed up on the shore, it wasn\u2019t him. The duplicate had the memories and the love for Rose, but he himself wasn\u2019t physically there. It was the duplicate that was.\u00a0</p><p><i>But Sab, we don\u2019t know the Doctor loved Rose for certain, he\u2019s never said it.</i></p><p>uh-huh. Well, if you really need me to tell you, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re watching the same show, but for good measures, here\u2019s the chorus.\u00a0</p><p>chorus<br></p><p>Reel me in, my precious girl<br>Come on, take me home<br>My body\u2019s tired of traveling<br>And my heart don\u2019t wish to roam</p><p>This is what plays just before the Doctor has his flashback. As he\u2019s watching all of the people on the dance floor, his eyes fixate on this one specific couple, the woman having blonde hair, just like Rose did. He fixates on this couple just after the lines\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy body\u2019s tired of traveling, and my heart don\u2019t wish to roam\u201d.</p><p>It\u2019s also important to note that the man dips the woman while dancing, and \u201creels\u201d her in, which is when the flashback of Rose begins in which a similar thing happens. This is important because again, it solidifies that this song is about the Doctor and Rose.\u00a0</p><p>So, what about the rest of the chorus, then? Well,\u00a0it\u2019s basically all been said. The Doctor has had all of these different companions which whom he loves and cherishes. However, the chorus adds this idea that he doesn\u2019t want to, or physically can\u2019t, be with all those companions anymore.</p><p>All he wants is to live a life where he can grow old like humans and not have to live with all of this constant regret and pain that comes with the passing of time. He just wants to settle down, have a more permanent life. He\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to do it alone, though. No, he wants to live a permanent life with Rose.</p><p>\u201cMy precious girl, come on, take me home\u201d says it all. He wants to be the one standing on that beach. He wants to be in Pete\u2019s world with Rose. He\u00a0doesn\u2019t want to travel with all of these different people anymore. He only wants <i>her.\u00a0</i></p><p>And\u00a0that\u2019s because the Doctor <i>loves </i>Rose Tyler.\u00a0</p><p>If you still don\u2019t believe me, maybe you\u2019ll believe Murray Gold, who composed the soundtrack:</p><p>\u201cIn the 2006 special\u00a0\u201cThe Runaway Bride\u201d we needed <a href=\"https://genius.com/Murray-gold-love-dont-roam-lyrics\">a song</a> that reflected the Doctor\u2019s inner thoughts whilst also being something you could imagine a crowd at a wedding dancing to. The third verse is especially inspired by David Tennant. The song is as much his as Song for Ten was before\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>I know what you must be thinking now. <i>Sab, why go through all that trouble when you could\u2019ve literally just posted this quote?</i> I could\u2019ve, but what\u2019s the fun in that?</p>",
