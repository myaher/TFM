When she thought she lost Carol she was broken, but knowing that she was alive now made all the pain worth while. Monica looked up to her mother and smiled, she had been waiting for Carol to come back for a few days but she promised she&rsquo;d be back today. The warm evening air drifted through them and they smiled as that familiar glow wave through the air. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss me?&rdquo; Carol smirked as she landed on the ground. </p><p>Maria let Monica go and laughed as her daughter ran into her&hellip; other mother shall we say. Carol chuckled as Monica almost tipped her over. Maria smiled brightly as Carol looked deep within her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; Maria whispered as Carol wrapped her arms around her. Maria put both arms around her neck, breathing in her scent. Carol sneakily kissed her cheek, causing Monica to giggle behind them. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too, both of you so much.&rdquo; Carol let go and took Monica&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you do this time?&rdquo; Monica asked, looking up to Carol. </p><p>Carol laughed, &ldquo;Well, fought some aliens on another planet, you know how it is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo; Monica shouted as she jumped up to the porch. Maria followed on behind, Carol glanced over and they smiled. Carol held out her other hand and pulled Maria up the stairs, taking a quick peek at the ring on her finger. </p><p>*</p><p>Maria sat on the sofa and watched as her wife lit the fire.

Carol looked up to her and winked. Maria bit her lip, her mind only on her family in front. </p><p>*</p><p>That night, they were in bed. Maria was sitting there cross legged, watching Carol get dressed. </p><p>\u201cHave you ever thought about expanding the family?\u201d She asked the blonde. </p><p>Carol turned around, \u201cWhat like, surrogacy? Or adopting again?\u201d </p><p>Maria shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe adopting again. I always feel so sorry for the kids that don\u2019t have any one else.\u201d </p><p>Carol frowned sitting on the bed, taking her wife\u2019s hands into her own, \u201cWe can adopt if you want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Maria whispered, eyes lighting up. </p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Carol kissed her forehead, \u201cMonica\u2019s always banging on about having siblings after all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s not going to be happening straight away.\u201d Maria explained. \u201cI mean remember what Fury said?\u201d </p><p>Carol laughed, \u201cOh yeah, that he\u2019d be the 'Godfather\u2019.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLove that film.\u201d Maria laughed shaking her head. \u201cCan you imagine that though?\u201d </p><p>Carol nodded, grinning as she did so. \u201cOh God, I can only imagine the look on his face, surrounded by all the children and he just puts-\u201d Carol was cut off as Maria jumped on her, wrapping her arms around her. </p><p>\u201cSorry, couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d Maria said, sighing and sitting on Carol\u2019s knees. </p><p>Carol smiled, breathing her in. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, it\u2019s been a while. God, I missed this.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d Maria flipped Carol onto her back and climbed over her, \u201cHigher, further, faster.\u201d </p><p>Carol closed her eyes, barking in laughter, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d She whispered undoing Maria\u2019s shirt. \u201cLooking mighty fine.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAs do you.\u201d </p><p>\u201cErm, should we lock the er\u2026\u201d She asked, pointing to the door.</p><p>Maria nodded, swinging off the bed, \u201cDon\u2019t want that to happen again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFury\u2019s face was a picture though.\u201d Carol recalled, laughing. </p><p>Maria leapt back onto the bed, crawling over, she laid on top of her wife, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to but the universe needs me, the thing is though\u2026\u201d</p><p>Maria raised an eyebrow. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my world. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d Carol whispered, smiling at her. \u201cI can stay for longer.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou already are.\u201d Maria confessed, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though I don\u2019t approve of you doing this it\u2019s just\u2026 I miss you so much when you\u2019re not here.\u201d </p><p>Carol bit her lip, lowering her gaze, \u201cPregnancy wise, if I carried a baby, I wouldn\u2019t have to leave.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou said you never would though.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah I know.\u201d Carol groaned, \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t want to either.\u201d <br>Maria shrugged, \u201cRock paper scissors? Besides, it\u2019s only if the adopting thing doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe could do both?\u201d Carol suggested, her arms snaking around Maria\u2019s back, drawing her closer. </p><p>\u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d </p><p>Carol and Maria finished that night, snuggled into their arms and embracing the other. Neither knew what the future had in store for them but what they did know was that nothing would ever tear them apart. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Maria stood outside, in front of the moon, holding her daughter&rsquo;s shoulders, waiting patiently. When she thought she lost Carol she was broken, but knowing that she was alive now made all the pain worth while. Monica looked up to her mother and smiled, she had been waiting for Carol to come back for a few days but she promised she&rsquo;d be back today. The warm evening air drifted through them and they smiled as that familiar glow wave through the air. </p><p>&ldquo;Miss me?&rdquo; Carol smirked as she landed on the ground. </p><p>Maria let Monica go and laughed as her daughter ran into her&hellip; other mother shall we say. Carol chuckled as Monica almost tipped her over. Maria smiled brightly as Carol looked deep within her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you.&rdquo; Maria whispered as Carol wrapped her arms around her. Maria put both arms around her neck, breathing in her scent. Carol sneakily kissed her cheek, causing Monica to giggle behind them. </p><p>&ldquo;I missed you too, both of you so much.&rdquo; Carol let go and took Monica&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>&ldquo;What did you do this time?&rdquo; Monica asked, looking up to Carol. </p><p>Carol laughed, &ldquo;Well, fought some aliens on another planet, you know how it is.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so cool!&rdquo; Monica shouted as she jumped up to the porch. Maria followed on behind, Carol glanced over and they smiled. Carol held out her other hand and pulled Maria up the stairs, taking a quick peek at the ring on her finger. </p><p>*</p><p>Maria sat on the sofa and watched as her wife lit the fire. Monica was sitting on the floor, drawing in her notepad. Carol swiped her hands down her trousers, she clambered to her feet and sat on the sofa, snuggling into her chest. </p><p>&ldquo;God, I&rsquo;ve missed this.&rdquo; Carol mumbled into her. </p><p>Maria smiled and placed her head on top of hers, &ldquo;When are you leaving again?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Probably a few days but I won&rsquo;t stay away for long, never can.&rdquo; Carol said, putting her hands on Maria&rsquo;s knee, gripping in gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving. Have you ate yet?&rdquo; </p><p>Maria shook her head, &ldquo;No not yet. What do you fancy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Can we get takeout?&rdquo; Monica asked, spinning around. </p><p>Carol looked up to Maria&rsquo;s eyes, silently begging her to say yes. Maria chuckled under her breath, &ldquo;Sure, why not?&rdquo; </p><p>Monica cheered mentally to herself and turned back to colour in the picture she had created. Carol looked over the edge of the sofa, over Monica&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>&ldquo;What you drawing kiddo?&rdquo; </p><p>Monica showed her, &ldquo;Goose. Where is she anyway?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s still with Fury. I&rsquo;m going to go get her tomorrow, bring her back here.&rdquo; </p><p>Monica grinned, returning back to the drawing, coloring it in orange. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind having Goose here.&rdquo; Maria whispered. &ldquo;As long as she doesn&rsquo;t eat us.&rdquo; </p><p>Carol laughed to her, &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t eat you. I&rsquo;d eat her though. Starving!&rdquo; </p><p>Maria gently shoved her off and stood up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call them up, what you fancy?&rdquo; </p><p>Carol shrugged, &ldquo;Anything.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mon?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anything too Mom.&rdquo; Monica giggled as Carol ticked her head with her foot. </p><p>Maria smiled and walked into the kitchen. Carol slid off the sofa and sat by Monica, &ldquo;Got you something while I was away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; </p><p>Carol handed her a little silver necklace, &ldquo;Got it from an alien market. Supposed to bring you good luck.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Mum.&rdquo; Monica put her arms around Carol, Carol hugged her back, snuggling her close. &ldquo;Missed you kiddo.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Missed you too.&rdquo; Carol whispered to her. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you like being a superhero?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Superhero? Is that what I am?&rdquo; </p><p>Monica nodded, &ldquo;Hell yeah! You&rsquo;re so cool though!&rdquo; </p><p>Carol beamed at her and ruffled her head, &ldquo;Well, I have a pretty good kid to inspire me.&rdquo; She winked at Monica, Monica giggled as Carol began to tickle her, sending her into a fit of laughter. </p><p>Maria could hear them from the kitchen and her heart glowed lighter, she felt like one of the luckiest people in the world. She had an amazing wife, amazing daughter and an amazing home. She felt great pride knowing that her wife was off saving the galaxy and she smiled knowing what Carol had told her the last time she was here, &lsquo;you keep the peace on Earth while I&rsquo;m off on other planets&rsquo;, it was just nice to know that the woman who she loved more than anything saw her as a hero too. </p><p>She walked back into the living room and sat back down on the sofa, &ldquo;So, food&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are we having Mom?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just you wait.&rdquo; Maria giggled.

However, I have no interest in any Marvel movie due to my jaded attitude, so I prefer Marvel cartoons like 90s X-Men TAS and Avengers EMH. \nThose Marvel comics I love reading are New Warriors, X-Men, Young Avengers, X-Factor, Avengers (not that Bendis era), Generation X, Avengers Academy and X-Force. \nBig fan of New Warriors and X-Men. \nMy Favourite Marvel characters are...GAMBIT (Remy LeBeau), JUBILEE (Jubilation Lee), SPEEDBALL (Robbie Baldwin), WICCAN (Billy Kaplan), JUSTICE (Vance Astrovik), ROGUE (Anna Marie), SPEED (Tommy Shepherd), NIGHTCRAWLER (Kurt Wagner), FIRESTAR (Angelica Jones), QUICKSILVER (Pietro Maximoff), SHE-HULK (Jennifer Walters), QUASAR (Wendell Vaughn) and COSMO the space dog.",

The screen reads \u20189:27am\u2019 and you bite your lip in thought before bringing up your contacts and finding Brie\u2019s name.</p><p>Brie had been away for a while, on set of the new Avengers movie, and you had both tried to call each or FaceTime each other regularly, but the last couple weeks you just kept missing each other. Brie was always filming or sleeping, or you were always busy with work, so you\u2019d been mainly relying heavily on texts to communicate with each other.</p><p>The slight time difference of only three hours had made it harder than you thought it would to catch each other at the right time too. Luckily, you had managed to get the day off, and figuring it would be about lunch time in Atlanta where Brie is filming, you decide to try your luck and hit the video call button next to her name.</p><p>You\u2019re well aware that the exact time Brie and the rest of the cast are able to take their break from filming obviously varies from day to day, and you\u2019re about to accept that you\u2019ve probably chosen to call her at the wrong time when suddenly the ringing stops and Brie appears on your screen, a huge grin across her face.</p><p>\u201cHey babe!\u201d She seems so excited to see you and her eyes light up at the sight of your grin on her own phone screen. You\u2019re just as excited to see her as well, remembering just how much you missed seeing that smile everyday.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Brie turns her head away from the screen for a moment, your eyes immediately landing on her hair. Your mouth falls open slightly. \u201cOh my god, your hair? Did you cut it?\u201d Brie looks back at the screen and offers you a cheeky smile when she sees your reaction to her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a wig. Why? You like what you see?\u201d She smirks and quirks her eyebrows at you and you can\u2019t help but laugh at her, shaking your head. You become aware of some loud chatter in the background and you see Brie standing and walking somewhere else, the voices becoming quieter.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cBrie, have I called at a bad time?\u201d She shakes her head lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Robert\u2019s holding a \u2018Women of the MCU\u2019 lunch right now. A few people couldn\u2019t make it because of their schedules but most of us are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d You exclaim, looking at Brie in awe. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, Brie! What are you still doing talking to me? Go hang out with everyone!\u201d Brie\u2019s smile falters slightly.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t spoken properly in weeks. I can\u2019t even remember the last time we FaceTimed.\u201d</p><p>You sigh. You can imagine Brie\u2019s feelings about your lack of communication lately probably match yours, so you understand the disheartened expression that crosses her face.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. But I can call you again later when you\u2019re finished for the day.\u201d Brie still wears a forlorn expression, but it\u2019s quickly wiped off her face when you hear a voice call out to her from somewhere out of the frame.</p><p>\u201cBrie! What\u2019re you doing over here?\u201d Brie looks up just as Elizabeth Olsen appears on your screen next to Brie. She looks over Brie\u2019s shoulder at the screen and sees you.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, is this Y/N?\u201d You\u2019re definitely surprised Elizabeth knows who you are, but she doesn\u2019t give you time to grow starstruck or nervous as she continues speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to finally talk to you! We\u2019ve heard a lot about you from this one here.\u201d She bumps Brie\u2019s shoulder with her own and Brie shoots her a light glare.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d You smirk and Elizabeth chuckles. Brie rolls her eyes but you see the blush appearing on her cheeks which only makes your smirk grow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just being dramatic. I love you more than anything, but I swear I don\u2019t talk about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Elizabeth grins, looking over her shoulder. \u201cHey, Danai! How much would you say Brie talks about Y/N?\u201d Brie\u2019s cheeks continue to grow even redder and she covers her face with her free hand for a moment, mumbling a quiet \u2018oh my god\u2019 before Danai Gurira appears behind Brie and looks at the phone screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she talks about you, like, 90% of the time.\u201d She smiles in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Brie quickly defends and both Elizabeth and Danai break into laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, we aren\u2019t saying it\u2019s a bad thing. It\u2019s cute how much you talk about her.\u201d Elizabeth smirks at how flustered Brie has become and you giggle as she tries to duck her head in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you two have said enough,\u201d Brie mutters and walks away from the two women who you can hear still laughing at Brie even after they disappear from the screen. You bite your lip to hold in your own laughter, sparing Brie from your teasing for the time being.</p><p>You watch her sit down at a table and settle the phone down against something, freeing both of her hands now and allowing her to lean away from the camera a little. Her eyes move to the screen again and you wish more than anything to be able to reach out and comfort her to remove the slight pout that\u2019s found its way to her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good with everyone on the set, babe?\u201d You question, hoping the change of subject will bring that beautiful smile back to Brie\u2019s face. It only takes a moment before she grins and you feel yourself getting lost just staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everyone\u2019s been so welcoming and supportive. Joining the MCU right now is the most daunting thing but everyone\u2019s really helped me out with it. It\u2019s just still so crazy that I get to work with so many incredible people, you know?\u201d You grin and nod, feeling just so damn proud of her. You and Brie smile at each other before Gwyneth Paltrow enters your screen, sitting down next to Brie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about incredible people?\u201d She asks in a lighthearted tone, grinning at the phone at you and wrapping her arm loosely around Brie\u2019s shoulders. You smile back, somehow managing to keep your cool.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Just that you\u2019re without a doubt the most incredible person I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Brie teases.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously,\u201d Gwyneth jokes and Brie chuckles in response.</p><p>It kind of blows your mind a little at how relaxed Brie is sitting next to Gwyneth Paltrow. You know you\u2019d be a nervous wreck talking to every single one of these incredible women you look up to so much. But it just further proves to you how incredible Brie herself is, and how lucky you are to have her be such a huge part of your life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the incredible one here, though, <i>Captain Marvel</i>.\u201d Gwyneth seems to share your thoughts and you think you see a look of pride on her face as she looks at Brie.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Brie sits up a little, an incredulous look on her face. \u201cYou were, like, <i>the</i> original woman of the MCU. You started it for all of us. I\u2019m just continuing what you started here.\u201d Gwyneth tilts her head and smiles a knowing kind of smile at Brie.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Brie. You\u2019re doing a lot more than that.\u201d Gwyneth shoots you a look and you nod at her in complete agreement before someone calls her name, pulling her attention away for a moment. She places her hand on Brie\u2019s shoulder as she stands. Before she leaves, she quickly leans back down towards the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice to kind of meet you by the way, Y/N. I really hope we get to meet in person soon!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, you too, Gwyneth!\u201d She waves to you and you try to act calm as she leaves the frame. You look at Brie in awe, your mouth open and Brie laughs at you.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? Now you know how I feel being surrounded by these amazing humans all day.\u201d Brie folds her arms on the table and leans on them to get closer to the phone screen, smiling softly at you. You\u2019re still kind of in awe of the women you had just briefly talked to, and then with the sight of Brie with that haircut looking at you like <i>that</i>, you were left completely speechless.</p><p>After a few moments of content silence, Brie\u2019s head snaps up at the sound of voices somewhere offscreen. She nods before looking back at you.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cBabe, Robert wants to take some photos.\u201d She smiles sadly at you and you can\u2019t help but feel a slight wave of disappointment too.</p><p><br/>\n\u201cOh. That sounds fun,\u201d you try to offer optimistically.</p><p>\u201cWe barely even got to talk,\u201d Brie says quietly, the slight pout returning to her face as her eyes look down at the table.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you say, gaining her attention again. \u201cI told you, we can talk more later. Call me when you\u2019re done with everything today, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019ll probably be pretty late, even with the time difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, I don\u2019t care what time it is. I miss you and I want to talk to you, okay?\u201d She nods and you see a smile forming on her face again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, stop telling your girlfriend how much you love her and come take some photos with us already.\u201d Brie looks up in the direction of the voice to glare at who you assume is Elizabeth as the rest of the group laugh. Brie sighs and looks back to you.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, baby. I\u2019ll call you. I love you,\u201d she speaks softly, most likely to avoid more teasing from the other women.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Brie.\u201d You blow her a kiss and see a sweet smile spread across her face before ending the FaceTime call.</p><p>Later that night, after Brie finishes on set and you actually have time to talk to each other, she FaceTimes you. Even though it\u2019s pretty late, like Brie had anticipated, you can\u2019t help the tired grin that stays plastered on your face for the entire call.</p><p>When there\u2019s a natural break in the conversation, you smirk at Brie and she raises an eyebrow in question.</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t stop talking about me, huh?\u201d</p><p>You let out a loud laugh as you watch Brie\u2019s smile drop from her face and she starts to grumble.</p>",

You bite your lip to hold in your own laughter, sparing Brie from your teasing for the time being.</p><p>You watch her sit down at a table and settle the phone down against something, freeing both of her hands now and allowing her to lean away from the camera a little. Her eyes move to the screen again and you wish more than anything to be able to reach out and comfort her to remove the slight pout that\u2019s found its way to her lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good with everyone on the set, babe?\u201d You question, hoping the change of subject will bring that beautiful smile back to Brie\u2019s face. It only takes a moment before she grins and you feel yourself getting lost just staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everyone\u2019s been so welcoming and supportive. Joining the MCU right now is the most daunting thing but everyone\u2019s really helped me out with it. It\u2019s just still so crazy that I get to work with so many incredible people, you know?\u201d You grin and nod, feeling just so damn proud of her. You and Brie smile at each other before Gwyneth Paltrow enters your screen, sitting down next to Brie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about incredible people?\u201d She asks in a lighthearted tone, grinning at the phone at you and wrapping her arm loosely around Brie\u2019s shoulders. You smile back, somehow managing to keep your cool.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Just that you\u2019re without a doubt the most incredible person I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Brie teases.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously,\u201d Gwyneth jokes and Brie chuckles in response.</p><p>It kind of blows your mind a little at how relaxed Brie is sitting next to Gwyneth Paltrow. You know you\u2019d be a nervous wreck talking to every single one of these incredible women you look up to so much. But it just further proves to you how incredible Brie herself is, and how lucky you are to have her be such a huge part of your life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the incredible one here, though, <i>Captain Marvel</i>.\u201d Gwyneth seems to share your thoughts and you think you see a look of pride on her face as she looks at Brie.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Brie sits up a little, an incredulous look on her face. \u201cYou were, like, <i>the</i> original woman of the MCU. You started it for all of us. I\u2019m just continuing what you started here.\u201d Gwyneth tilts her head and smiles a knowing kind of smile at Brie.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Brie. You\u2019re doing a lot more than that.\u201d Gwyneth shoots you a look and you nod at her in complete agreement before someone calls her name, pulling her attention away for a moment. She places her hand on Brie\u2019s shoulder as she stands. Before she leaves, she quickly leans back down towards the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice to kind of meet you by the way, Y/N. I really hope we get to meet in person soon!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, you too, Gwyneth!\u201d She waves to you and you try to act calm as she leaves the frame. You look at Brie in awe, your mouth open and Brie laughs at you.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? Now you know how I feel being surrounded by these amazing humans all day.\u201d Brie folds her arms on the table and leans on them to get closer to the phone screen, smiling softly at you. You\u2019re still kind of in awe of the women you had just briefly talked to, and then with the sight of Brie with that haircut looking at you like <i>that</i>, you were left completely speechless.</p><p>After a few moments of content silence, Brie\u2019s head snaps up at the sound of voices somewhere offscreen. She nods before looking back at you.</p><p><br>\n\u201cBabe, Robert wants to take some photos.\u201d She smiles sadly at you and you can\u2019t help but feel a slight wave of disappointment too.</p><p><br>\n\u201cOh. That sounds fun,\u201d you try to offer optimistically.</p><p>\u201cWe barely even got to talk,\u201d Brie says quietly, the slight pout returning to her face as her eyes look down at the table.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you say, gaining her attention again. \u201cI told you, we can talk more later. Call me when you\u2019re done with everything today, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, it\u2019ll probably be pretty late, even with the time difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, I don\u2019t care what time it is. I miss you and I want to talk to you, okay?\u201d She nods and you see a smile forming on her face again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrie, stop telling your girlfriend how much you love her and come take some photos with us already.\u201d Brie looks up in the direction of the voice to glare at who you assume is Elizabeth as the rest of the group laugh. Brie sighs and looks back to you.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, baby. I\u2019ll call you. I love you,\u201d she speaks softly, most likely to avoid more teasing from the other women.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Brie.\u201d You blow her a kiss and see a sweet smile spread across her face before ending the FaceTime call.</p><p>Later that night, after Brie finishes on set and you actually have time to talk to each other, she FaceTimes you. Even though it\u2019s pretty late, like Brie had anticipated, you can\u2019t help the tired grin that stays plastered on your face for the entire call.</p><p>When there\u2019s a natural break in the conversation, you smirk at Brie and she raises an eyebrow in question.</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t stop talking about me, huh?\u201d</p><p>You let out a loud laugh as you watch Brie\u2019s smile drop from her face and she starts to grumble.</p>",

The screen reads \u20189:27am\u2019 and you bite your lip in thought before bringing up your contacts and finding Brie\u2019s name.</p><p>Brie had been away for a while, on set of the new Avengers movie, and you had both tried to call each or FaceTime each other regularly, but the last couple weeks you just kept missing each other. Brie was always filming or sleeping, or you were always busy with work, so you\u2019d been mainly relying heavily on texts to communicate with each other.</p><p>The slight time difference of only three hours had made it harder than you thought it would to catch each other at the right time too. Luckily, you had managed to get the day off, and figuring it would be about lunch time in Atlanta where Brie is filming, you decide to try your luck and hit the video call button next to her name.</p><p>You\u2019re well aware that the exact time Brie and the rest of the cast are able to take their break from filming obviously varies from day to day, and you\u2019re about to accept that you\u2019ve probably chosen to call her at the wrong time when suddenly the ringing stops and Brie appears on your screen, a huge grin across her face.</p><p>\u201cHey babe!\u201d She seems so excited to see you and her eyes light up at the sight of your grin on her own phone screen. You\u2019re just as excited to see her as well, remembering just how much you missed seeing that smile everyday.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Brie turns her head away from the screen for a moment, your eyes immediately landing on her hair. Your mouth falls open slightly. \u201cOh my god, your hair? Did you cut it?\u201d Brie looks back at the screen and offers you a cheeky smile when she sees your reaction to her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a wig. Why? You like what you see?\u201d She smirks and quirks her eyebrows at you and you can\u2019t help but laugh at her, shaking your head. You become aware of some loud chatter in the background and you see Brie standing and walking somewhere else, the voices becoming quieter.</p><p><br>\n\u201cBrie, have I called at a bad time?\u201d She shakes her head lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Robert\u2019s holding a \u2018Women of the MCU\u2019 lunch right now. A few people couldn\u2019t make it because of their schedules but most of us are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d You exclaim, looking at Brie in awe. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool, Brie! What are you still doing talking to me? Go hang out with everyone!\u201d Brie\u2019s smile falters slightly.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t spoken properly in weeks. I can\u2019t even remember the last time we FaceTimed.\u201d</p><p>You sigh. You can imagine Brie\u2019s feelings about your lack of communication lately probably match yours, so you understand the disheartened expression that crosses her face.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. But I can call you again later when you\u2019re finished for the day.\u201d Brie still wears a forlorn expression, but it\u2019s quickly wiped off her face when you hear a voice call out to her from somewhere out of the frame.</p><p>\u201cBrie! What\u2019re you doing over here?\u201d Brie looks up just as Elizabeth Olsen appears on your screen next to Brie. She looks over Brie\u2019s shoulder at the screen and sees you.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, is this Y/N?\u201d You\u2019re definitely surprised Elizabeth knows who you are, but she doesn\u2019t give you time to grow starstruck or nervous as she continues speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to finally talk to you! We\u2019ve heard a lot about you from this one here.\u201d She bumps Brie\u2019s shoulder with her own and Brie shoots her a light glare.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d You smirk and Elizabeth chuckles. Brie rolls her eyes but you see the blush appearing on her cheeks which only makes your smirk grow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just being dramatic. I love you more than anything, but I swear I don\u2019t talk about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Elizabeth grins, looking over her shoulder. \u201cHey, Danai! How much would you say Brie talks about Y/N?\u201d Brie\u2019s cheeks continue to grow even redder and she covers her face with her free hand for a moment, mumbling a quiet \u2018oh my god\u2019 before Danai Gurira appears behind Brie and looks at the phone screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say she talks about you, like, 90% of the time.\u201d She smiles in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Brie quickly defends and both Elizabeth and Danai break into laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, we aren\u2019t saying it\u2019s a bad thing.

How much would you say Brie talks about Y/N?&rdquo; Brie&rsquo;s cheeks continue to grow even redder and she covers her face with her free hand for a moment, mumbling a quiet &lsquo;oh my god&rsquo; before Danai Gurira appears behind Brie and looks at the phone screen.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say she talks about you, like, 90% of the time.&rdquo; She smiles in amusement.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; Brie quickly defends and both Elizabeth and Danai break into laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, we aren&rsquo;t saying it&rsquo;s a bad thing. It&rsquo;s cute how much you talk about her.&rdquo; Elizabeth smirks at how flustered Brie has become and you giggle as she tries to duck her head in embarrassment.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, you two have said enough,&rdquo; Brie mutters and walks away from the two women who you can hear still laughing at Brie even after they disappear from the screen. You bite your lip to hold in your own laughter, sparing Brie from your teasing for the time being.</p><p>You watch her sit down at a table and settle the phone down against something, freeing both of her hands now and allowing her to lean away from the camera a little. Her eyes move to the screen again and you wish more than anything to be able to reach out and comfort her to remove the slight pout that&rsquo;s found its way to her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been good with everyone on the set, babe?&rdquo; You question, hoping the change of subject will bring that beautiful smile back to Brie&rsquo;s face. It only takes a moment before she grins and you feel yourself getting lost just staring at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Everyone&rsquo;s been so welcoming and supportive. Joining the MCU right now is the most daunting thing but everyone&rsquo;s really helped me out with it. It&rsquo;s just still so crazy that I get to work with so many incredible people, you know?&rdquo; You grin and nod, feeling just so damn proud of her. You and Brie smile at each other before Gwyneth Paltrow enters your screen, sitting down next to Brie.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about incredible people?&rdquo; She asks in a lighthearted tone, grinning at the phone at you and wrapping her arm loosely around Brie&rsquo;s shoulders. You smile back, somehow managing to keep your cool.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you know. Just that you&rsquo;re without a doubt the most incredible person I&rsquo;ve ever worked with,&rdquo; Brie teases.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, obviously,&rdquo; Gwyneth jokes and Brie chuckles in response.</p><p>It kind of blows your mind a little at how relaxed Brie is sitting next to Gwyneth Paltrow. You know you&rsquo;d be a nervous wreck talking to every single one of these incredible women you look up to so much. But it just further proves to you how incredible Brie herself is, and how lucky you are to have her be such a huge part of your life.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the incredible one here, though, <i>Captain Marvel</i>.&rdquo; Gwyneth seems to share your thoughts and you think you see a look of pride on her face as she looks at Brie.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo; Brie sits up a little, an incredulous look on her face. &ldquo;You were, like, <i>the</i> original woman of the MCU. You started it for all of us. I&rsquo;m just continuing what you started here.&rdquo; Gwyneth tilts her head and smiles a knowing kind of smile at Brie.</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me, Brie. You&rsquo;re doing a lot more than that.&rdquo; Gwyneth shoots you a look and you nod at her in complete agreement before someone calls her name, pulling her attention away for a moment. She places her hand on Brie&rsquo;s shoulder as she stands. Before she leaves, she quickly leans back down towards the phone.</p><p>&ldquo;It was really nice to kind of meet you by the way, Y/N. I really hope we get to meet in person soon!&rdquo;</p><p>Yeah, you too, Gwyneth!&rdquo; She waves to you and you try to act calm as she leaves the frame. You look at Brie in awe, your mouth open and Brie laughs at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right? Now you know how I feel being surrounded by these amazing humans all day.&rdquo; Brie folds her arms on the table and leans on them to get closer to the phone screen, smiling softly at you. You&rsquo;re still kind of in awe of the women you had just briefly talked to, and then with the sight of Brie with that haircut looking at you like <i>that</i>, you were left completely speechless.</p><p>After a few moments of content silence, Brie&rsquo;s head snaps up at the sound of voices somewhere offscreen. She nods before looking back at you.</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;Babe, Robert wants to take some photos.&rdquo; She smiles sadly at you and you can&rsquo;t help but feel a slight wave of disappointment too.</p><p><br />\n&ldquo;Oh. That sounds fun,&rdquo; you try to offer optimistically.</p><p>&ldquo;We barely even got to talk,&rdquo; Brie says quietly, the slight pout returning to her face as her eyes look down at the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you say, gaining her attention again. &ldquo;I told you, we can talk more later. Call me when you&rsquo;re done with everything today, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, it&rsquo;ll probably be pretty late, even with the time difference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brie, I don&rsquo;t care what time it is. I miss you and I want to talk to you, okay?&rdquo; She nods and you see a smile forming on her face again.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brie, stop telling your girlfriend how much you love her and come take some photos with us already.&rdquo; Brie looks up in the direction of the voice to glare at who you assume is Elizabeth as the rest of the group laugh. Brie sighs and looks back to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I gotta go, baby. I&rsquo;ll call you. I love you,&rdquo; she speaks softly, most likely to avoid more teasing from the other women.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too, Brie.&rdquo; You blow her a kiss and see a sweet smile spread across her face before ending the FaceTime call.</p><p>Later that night, after Brie finishes on set and you actually have time to talk to each other, she FaceTimes you. Even though it&rsquo;s pretty late, like Brie had anticipated, you can&rsquo;t help the tired grin that stays plastered on your face for the entire call.</p><p>When there&rsquo;s a natural break in the conversation, you smirk at Brie and she raises an eyebrow in question.</p><p>&ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t stop talking about me, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a loud laugh as you watch Brie&rsquo;s smile drop from her face and she starts to grumble.</p>",

If you&rsquo;re still doing requests, can you write something about Brie interacting with all the mcu women? Like what happened during that lunch party Robert held. Or it could be a sequel to Home and Comfort where Reader is involved. Your choice. Thanks again.<br /></p>\n<p><b>Pairing:</b>&nbsp;Brie x Reader</p>\n<p><b>A/N: </b>I have been trying to figure out the best way to write this request with Reader still heavily in the story. I hope this is okay!
