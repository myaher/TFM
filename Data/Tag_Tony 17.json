Incoming call from Ned Leeds!&rdquo; FRIDAY&rsquo;s voice cut through Tony&rsquo;s fevered work rampage. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; he asked. His mind was still wrapped up in his new project.\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Ned Leeds is calling. Peter&rsquo;s friend from high school.&rdquo; FRIDAY tried again. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Huh&hellip; Why does he have my number?&rdquo; he blinked. Man, his eyes were burning. When was the last time he actually slept? </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Peter probably gave it to him,&rdquo; if FRIDAY could shrug, she would have done it. &ldquo;Boss. Do you want to answer it?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put him through!&rdquo; Tony waved. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark? Holly shit! Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s voice filled the lab. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Volume!&rdquo; Tony muttered. &ldquo;Leeds? How can I help you?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! You have to come here like immediately! It&rsquo;s Peter!&rdquo; the kid rambled. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony was fully awake and functional the next second. His eyes wide, anxiety activated and reaching level 9000. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Where is he?&rdquo; he asked. He moved quickly towards the lift. As soon as he stepped inside, the little cubic shot upwards. FRIDAY made sure that it was moving as fast as it could. He almost fell over, when it stopped suddenly. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the specifics, but something blew up and Peter is&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Peter is what?&rdquo; Tony snapped. He barely stepped out of the compound and already his suit was wrapping around his body. FRIDAY had the coordinates already thanks to her connection to Karen and she had a flight plan ready for him. He flew off at full speed towards the disaster zone. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Erm&hellip; high?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony nearly lost his balance as he heard the uttered words. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p><br/></p><p>He was nearing his destination. He could see thick, dark smoke curling in the sky above something that looked like the remains of a warehouse. \u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he is high!&rdquo; Leeds sounded way too cheerful for Tony&rsquo;s liking. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony decided that it was safer to end the call with the teenager if he wanted to keep his sanity. After all, he got his eyes on his protege already and man, things looked bad. First of all, it was not just a warehouse, it was a warehouse complex and half of it was on fire. Spiderman decided that it was a good idea to make a motherfucking hammock between the buildings and sit on it while rocking back and forth. The brat was lucky that he didn&rsquo;t catch on fire for God&rsquo;s sake! And was he&hellip; giggling? </p><p><br/></p><p>Oh, and they had caught the public attention all right. Phones and cameras everywhere. Great!</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Spiderman!&rdquo; he called out sternly. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>The kid&rsquo;s head swung towards him and holy shit! He almost lost his balance!</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! Look! Pretty!&rdquo; he waved at the flames. </p><p><br/></p><p>Mr. Stark groaned. Loudly. Prolonged. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;FRIDAY?&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;There is a huge amount of marijuana burning in building C&rdquo; she supplied. She sounded like someone who was laughing her head off. Bad AI!</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Get me through Karen!&rdquo; he snapped. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Boss!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What happened Karen?&rdquo; he asked. He kept his gaze on the wobbly teen. Fortunately, Peter didn&rsquo;t set off just yet.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;We accidentally caused a gas leak. After the explosion, Peter inhaled some of the smoke.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; Tony huffed. &ldquo;Take over the suit now!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t Mr. Stark.&rdquo; Karen actually sounded sad. &ldquo;Peter disabled me.&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Tony barked. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;He is getting really good at it! You should be proud!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony cursed himself. He should stop making AIs. They all end up sassing back at him in the end.</p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He sighed. More and more people crowed around the place. They needed to get out of there. &ldquo;Spiderman! It&rsquo;s time to go! Come on!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Peter let out a high pitched sound. Tony froze in the middle of descending next to the teen. The next moment a web was shot towards the nearest building and Peter was swinging away from him. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Yeeeeeeeet!&rdquo; the kid shouted as he got further away. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony stared after him for a couple of seconds. His face was frozen in shock under the mask. How did this become his life? </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Spiderman!&rdquo; he shouted enraged when he finally snapped out of his self-pity. He flew after the boy, who kept swinging from building to building while giggling crazily. They ended up in a supernatural game of tag. Tony avoided thinking about how comical the both of them must have looked as he tried unsuccessfully to capture the brat. </p><p><br/></p><p>In the end, though, luck ran out for the kid. Spider-senses and fast reflexes were good and very useful things if you were sober. However, being this high, things just slip out of perspective. Just like how the web slipped out of the kid&rsquo;s hand and he ended up slamming into the nearest building&rsquo;s wall. </p><p><br/></p><p>Tony winced at the sound, but he was there to catch Peter when he started falling. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You okay, kid?&rdquo; he asked hesitantly. </p><p><br/></p><p>The boy lazily raised his head and the mask&rsquo;s white eyes stared at him. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark!&rdquo; the boy sounded teary. Suddenly four way too strong limbs wrapped around the iron suit and squeezed. The billionaire yelped at the sudden shift and he nearly lost his balance. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! It hurt!&rdquo; \u00a0the kid squeezed again. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; Tony tried to reassure him. He sounded awkward even for his own ears. &ldquo;You are fine! Right, Karen?&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;He is still high as a kite, but no serious damage!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Sighing, Tony patted Spiderman&rsquo;s head as gently as he could in his suit, then he wrapped his arm around the kid&rsquo;s waist securing him against his armor. </p><p><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Hold on tight! We are going home!&rdquo; </p><p><br/></p><p>Oh man, the kid had strong arms! </p><p><br/></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMTTSAg6GZ7WOJQ_5Mj374A\">@moonestaly</a></p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJfd_GuHAIroD1VbD3Jz4iw\">@tonyparkerstark</a></p>",

Spider-senses and fast reflexes were good and very useful things if you were sober. However, being this high, things just slip out of perspective.

It hurt!\u201d \u00a0the kid squeezed again. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Tony tried to reassure him. He sounded awkward even for his own ears. \u201cYou are fine! Right, Karen?\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHe is still high as a kite, but no serious damage!\u201d </p><p><br></p><p>Sighing, Tony patted Spiderman\u2019s head as gently as he could in his suit, then he wrapped his arm around the kid\u2019s waist securing him against his armor. </p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHold on tight!

Incoming call from Ned Leeds!&rdquo; FRIDAY&rsquo;s voice cut through Tony&rsquo;s fevered work rampage. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; he asked. His mind was still wrapped up in his new project.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ned Leeds is calling. Peter&rsquo;s friend from high school.&rdquo; FRIDAY tried again. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Huh&hellip; Why does he have my number?&rdquo; he blinked. Man, his eyes were burning. When was the last time he actually slept? </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter probably gave it to him,&rdquo; if FRIDAY could shrug, she would have done it. &ldquo;Boss. Do you want to answer it?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put him through!&rdquo; Tony waved. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark? Holly shit! Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Ned&rsquo;s voice filled the lab. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Volume!&rdquo; Tony muttered. &ldquo;Leeds? How can I help you?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark! You have to come here like immediately! It&rsquo;s Peter!&rdquo; the kid rambled. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony was fully awake and functional the next second. His eyes wide, anxiety activated and reaching level 9000. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What happened? Where is he?&rdquo; he asked. He moved quickly towards the lift. As soon as he stepped inside, the little cubic shot upwards. FRIDAY made sure that it was moving as fast as it could. He almost fell over, when it stopped suddenly. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the specifics, but something blew up and Peter is&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Peter is what?&rdquo; Tony snapped. He barely stepped out of the compound and already his suit was wrapping around his body. FRIDAY had the coordinates already thanks to her connection to Karen and she had a flight plan ready for him. He flew off at full speed towards the disaster zone. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Erm&hellip; high?&rdquo; </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony nearly lost his balance as he heard the uttered words. </p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p><br /></p><p>He was nearing his destination. He could see thick, dark smoke curling in the sky above something that looked like the remains of a warehouse. &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he is high!&rdquo; Leeds sounded way too cheerful for Tony&rsquo;s liking. </p><p><br /></p><p>Tony decided that it was safer to end the call with the teenager if he wanted to keep his sanity.
