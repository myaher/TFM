River\u2019s Holiday Challenge</p><p>image by @maniploki</p><!-- more --><p>Chris exited the elevator in a short green dress and black leggings, orange fringe falling in her face again, arm looped around her boyfriend. \u00a0It had taken some effort, but she finally managed to convince Loki to come to the party. \u00a0He had found a nice green tunic and black slacks. \u00a0His shoulder-length raven curls looked immaculate against the tunic.<br/></p><p>An old man in a veteran\u2019s cap and a young blond woman hurried into the elevator behind them. \u00a0People were everywhere, standing, chatting and holding drinks. \u00a0They passed a man with braces on his knees and back. \u00a0He was wearing nice slacks and a winter-themed polo shirt. \u00a0\u201cBoom, ya\u2019 lookin\u2019 fo dis?\u201d he said to a round of chuckles. \u00a0Apparently, his story had been funny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I didn\u2019t receive an invitation directly from Tony?\u201d Loki whined for the um-teenth time. \u00a0\u201cEvery one of them agreed I was as much an Avenger now as any of them. \u00a0Yet, they still don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your titles,\u201d Chris explained absently, shaking the hand of a tipsy dignitary. \u00a0\u201cLiesmith, god of mischief, bringer of chaos. \u00a0They\u2019re afraid of you.\u201d \u00a0She spoke lightly enough, but really she hoped her words would comfort the gloomy god. \u00a0She was seldom afforded the opportunity to attend such illustrious events and she was determined to enjoy herself, even if Loki didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, the god of thunder sounds equally as frightening, along with his less familiar name, cosmic oaf.\u201d \u00a0Loki smiled sardonically as they passed into the first room from the elevator hall. \u00a0They passed a wall-sized TV and several teenagers sitting on fluffy furniture.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Peter,\u201d a pretty girl cried as she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I can, Princess,\u201d Peter replied. \u00a0These two were holding controllers while the wall-screen showed a split view of two cars.<br/><br/>\u201cYeah, you show her Peter,\u201d said a chubby Asian, supporting his best friend. \u00a0A brown-haired youth playing with glowing red mist seemed to support the princess.</p><p>\u201cI should in with that group,\u201d Loki pouted as they left the teens behind. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m closer comparatively to their age than to yours. \u00a0Yet they never invite me to &ndash; what\u2019s the Earth vernacular &ndash; hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to invite you, but you kept turning them down, remember? \u00a0Something about them being immature and primitive?\u201d \u00a0Chris took a moment to bow to a dark-skinned king wearing a silver claw-shaped necklace. \u00a0Loki followed suit, and the man returned it, but he was on a mission, so they did not stop and talk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth of those statements are true,\u201d Loki spat. \u00a0\u201cIt still would have been nice to be asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well. \u00a0If it isn\u2019t the bringer of woes,\u201d said a strong-jawed blond man with pecs to rival Thor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Loki said as he inclined his head and scowled.</p><p>\u201cI saw Tony\u2019s invitation list,\u201d Steve said with accusation in his tone. \u00a0\u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here as Thor\u2019s pluses,\u201d Chris chimed in sweetly. \u00a0The man in the ugly Christmas sweater looked down at her as if noticing her for the first time.</p><p>\u201cOf course Thor would invite his brother,\u201d Steve said glancing back at Loki. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce me to your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you\u2019d stop judging me long enough to speak, you\u2019d already know her name,\u201d The silvertongue hissed. \u00a0The two men glared at each other, but the little woman put a quick stop to it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Chris,\u201d she introduced, holding out her hand. \u00a0Steve blushed and put on a little smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Chris. \u00a0I\u2019m Steve.\u201d \u00a0He shook her hand as a brown-haired man in another ugly Christmas sweater joined us. \u00a0He held a drink in a metal hand. \u00a0\u201cChris, this is my best friend, Bucky.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Bucky held out his hand to the small woman, who took it kindly. \u00a0He\u2019d been asleep for most of Loki\u2019s crimes against Earth. \u00a0More than that, he understood the horrific torments of being controlled or influenced with no way of fighting back. \u00a0Bucky smiled warmly as he held out a hand to the trickster. \u00a0Loki took the offered hand slowly. \u00a0When he saw the familiar pain behind his eyes, he offered a small smile himself. \u00a0The two seemed to become instant friends without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Chris, nice to meet you Loki,\u201d he said at last, then engaged the glowering blond.</p><p>\u201cAh, Thor!\u201d Chris exclaimed, heading across the room. \u00a0Loki turned to engage a small Chinese doctor. \u00a0Chris returned just as the doctor was excusing herself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot, I got you something!\u201d Chris said excitedly. \u00a0She pulled a green santa hat out of her bag. \u00a0It had white fur trimming and a large white fur puff on the end of a point.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with that?\u201d Loki asked, pouting again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPut it on! \u00a0It\u2019s a hat!\u201d \u00a0Chris explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing that. \u00a0I actually have a sense of fashion.\u201d \u00a0Loki walked away, ignoring the offered gift. \u00a0Chris followed, holding out the accessory.</p><p>They passed the renowned Natasha and Clint, who looked intense if a bit rosied, and ready to start comparing scars. \u00a0Natasha was still sober enough to afford the god a nasty glaring smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fashion sense won\u2019t be offended by this. \u00a0It perfectly matches your tunic,\u201d Chris said when Loki finally stopped and she caught up to him.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t respect me here,\u201d Loki sighed dramatically. \u00a0\u201cThey say I\u2019m one of them, but they don\u2019t respect me the same. \u00a0Am I really so different from Thor?\u201d \u00a0They walked away toward a table laden with goodies. \u00a0Chris did not hesitate to help herself. \u00a0\u201cIt was my Seidr that helped us escape in Alfheim. \u00a0It was my silver tongue that almost got us out of battle with the frost giants. \u00a0It was my daggers that saved us on Svartalheim. \u00a0The avengers wouldn\u2019t even exist if it wasn\u2019t for me, my cunning and strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Chris asked politely. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just, you really should try these cookies. \u00a0Billionaires get the best of everything.\u201d \u00a0Loki, with his sweet tooth, was not about to turn down offered treats. \u00a0When Chris saw he was in the mood to be handed things, she held out the hat again. \u00a0\u201cAnd you should try this hat on.\u201d \u00a0She smiled coyly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to wear that thing! \u00a0It looks like it was made for a child,\u201d Loki sneered, walking away from the table. \u00a0Chris grabbed one more cheese ball before following.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was made for an old man.\u201d \u00a0The little woman pointed out a fat man in a bright red suit lined with white fur, like the green cap. \u00a0A dark man with very short hair and a chiseled, pointy face gave a jolly laugh as he interacted with the actor. \u00a0Loki laughed inside, but kept a stern exterior. \u00a0Finally, he dragged his eyes away from the happy scene.</p><p>\u201cWell I am neither a child nor an old man,\u201d Loki pouted. \u00a0\u201cSo I don\u2019t think it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki, you\u2019re the oldest man I know besides your big brother. \u00a0Come on, just wear the santa hat for a little bit?\u201d \u00a0Loki shook his head and Chris lowered it. \u00a0The red-head gasped and pointed dramatically at someone\u2019s back. \u00a0\u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d \u00a0She was suddenly extremely excited, but Loki didn\u2019t know why. \u00a0For one thing, he didn\u2019t know who his girlfriend was referring to.</p><p>Chris shot off away from Loki and he followed her with his gaze. \u00a0She gestured wildly and glowed a beautiful apricot as she spoke. \u00a0Loki had to hide a smile behind his hand as he watched her, amazed at his luck to have her. \u00a0The woman she talked to stood tall, bald, straight like a warrior. \u00a0But she wore an obscene amount of glitter! \u00a0Really, it was amazing she wasn\u2019t shedding any of it!</p><p>Chris returned with her Christmas green eyes dazzling and Loki donned the hardest frown he\u2019d ever had to wear.</p><p>\u201cI wish someone would approach me like that,\u201d he moaned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be a sourpuss,\u201d Chris said with a playful pout. \u00a0She stroked the bridge of the mournful man\u2019s nose.</p><p>They ambled through the party, seeing this one and that one. \u00a0They greeted more veterans. \u00a0They passed through a sea of pretty girls. \u00a0Bruce was leaning against the wall studying the fireplace. \u00a0Loki continued to pout.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think nobody likes me?\u201d he asked pointedly. \u00a0Chris hummed in slight irritation but answered cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cRight now, nobody likes you because you\u2019re being a party pooper.\u201d \u00a0She decided to make another push before he asked about the idiom. \u00a0\u201cWhy not put the hat on? \u00a0You\u2019ll look more festive and cheerful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO.\u201d \u00a0He spoke firmly and she dropped her smile. \u00a0A noise at the far end of the room grabbed their attention.</p><p>\u201cOh, look! \u00a0It\u2019s your brother Thor,\u201d Chris beamed. \u00a0\u201cWant to go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that either,\u201d Loki hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got his Christmas hat on,\u201d Chris pointed out. \u00a0Sure enough, the blond muscle-bound god wore a red Christmas hat fringed in white, just like the green one. \u00a0\u201cHe sure looks cheerful,\u201d Chris said with intrigue.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Loki said. \u00a0His defenses were weakening.</p><p>\u201cSo festive, having so much fun,\u201d Chris continued with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I care?\u201d Loki feigned, cracking around the edges.</p><p>\u201cHe sure looks more festive than you.\u201d \u00a0That did it. \u00a0Loki broke completely.</p><p>\u201cGive me the infernal accessory,\u201d Loki growled, snatching it. \u00a0He thrust it on his head, the bobble knocking against his forehead. \u00a0\u201cThere. \u00a0How do I look?\u201d</p><p>Chris adjusted the hat so it sat on the side of head, less annoying, and kissed his sugar-pink lips with her Christmas red ones. \u00a0\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d she beamed.</p><p>After this, Loki thought he\u2019d better at least appear to make an effort, so he calculated how much sass and how much charm to approach the other guests. \u00a0A man who was far too jovial was performing Earth magic for a group of onlookers. \u00a0He must have been doing a good job, because they sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loki, want to go over there and show them what real magic is?\u201d \u00a0Chris suggested. \u00a0The trickster would have liked nothing more, but time was drawing short.</p><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to waste my Seidr on some silly party trick.\u201d \u00a0Chris shook her head sadly and they moved on. \u00a0A man with red skin and a golden cape caught Chris\u2019s attention next. \u00a0She greeted him, and Loki was polite enough about it. \u00a0The little woman was drawn easily into a conversation, however.</p><p>Loki crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the door frame to the next room. \u00a0This was the place and the time was now. \u00a0Loki\u2019s eyes shined with mischief and a cunning half smile spread across his lips. \u00a0It started in the green box under the Christmas tree. \u00a0Loki scrambled for Chris\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cDarling, come look at this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Ms. Light. \u00a0I\u2019ll go see what Wanda is doing.\u201d \u00a0The android disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou should try to get to know him,\u201d Chris explained. \u00a0\u201cHe thinks of your brother as one of his fathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him,\u201d Loki said distracted. \u00a0\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d \u00a0But no explanation was needed. \u00a0One of the presents began to glow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, fire,\u201d someone called. \u00a0\u201cI think that present\u2019s on fire!\u201d \u00a0Alarm spread through the crowd as they all turned to see the danger. \u00a0Tony turned from the bar with another drink in hand. \u00a0He hurried to the front of the room. \u00a0Sure enough, golden light grew slowly out of the green box reaching slowly upward.</p><p>\u201cFriday, why isn\u2019t the fire suppression system coming on?\u201d \u00a0Tony asked, pulling out a small transparent tablet.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI replied cooley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking right at it. \u00a0Check the Christmas tree,\u201d Tony demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI repeated. \u00a0He spotted Loki, who stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he barked, pointing a violent finger. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing something\u2026 wizard. \u00a0Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you accuse me?\u201d Loki replied nonchalantly. \u00a0Chris just smiled knowingly and held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t even invited, Reindeer Games. \u00a0What are you doing here?\u201d Tony looked even more livid than he was suspicious. \u00a0</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they all craned to see. \u00a0The glowing yellow light suddenly shot several feet into the air and sent little sparks everywhere!</p><p>\u201cFriday, talk to me,\u201d Tony demanded as he watched in horror. \u00a0Chris crossed her arms and glared at Loki with that knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the fun, Darling,\u201d he warned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust tell me it\u2019s not deadly,\u201d Chris demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow should I\u201d&ndash; but the look on her face made him reconsider. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not deadly.\u201d</p><p>They watched the show together. \u00a0The sparks grew in number, but where they lighted, nothing burned. \u00a0The box had finished blazing, but it hadn\u2019t burnt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d someone asked above the chaos. \u00a0More people from other rooms were rushing in to see the comotion. \u00a0One of the sparks hovered over a man\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0He and his neighbors strained to look at it. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not fire, it\u2019s an insect.\u201d \u00a0A few women shrieked. \u00a0Others were making observations. \u00a0</p><p>A woman with orange hair and lots of freckles known as Mrs. Stark held out her hand to catch one. \u00a0A golden light landed lightly on her palm and started to dance. \u00a0\u201cFairies? \u00a0Who brought fairies?\u201d \u00a0But she thought she already knew. \u00a0She looked around for the perpetrator. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre those wild forest fairies from Alfheim?\u201d \u00a0Thor asked, placing a heavy hand on Loki\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not! \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t trust mortals with the wild ones. \u00a0These ones have been domesticated. \u00a0It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d \u00a0Thor smirked.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care about safety?\u201d \u00a0One fluttered close to Chris\u2019s nose and she couldn\u2019t help but gasp and giggle. \u00a0Loki had had enough watching.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, these are fairies,\u201d he said loudly, stepping into the room with his arms spread for effect. \u00a0\u201cI bring them to you straight from the land of the light elves, Alfheim. \u00a0Domesticated Forest fairies. \u00a0Please enjoy! \u00a0And Merry Christmas from the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0There was a roaring round of applause as Loki beamed and bowed. \u00a0Tony pulled him out of the spotlight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Loki. \u00a0How\u2019d you get in here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe invited guests were allowed plus ones, Tony,\u201d Mrs. Stark interrupted, her words only slightly slurred.</p><p>\u201cThor invited me, since I was the only Avenger to not get an invitation. \u00a0And I invited my sweetheart, Chris.\u201d \u00a0He held out his hand and the little woman in green came to his side.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas,\u201d Tony chortled. \u00a0The woman with short orange hair glowered.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it when people use her full name,\u201d Loki warned.</p><p>\u201cHer full name? \u00a0Chris &ndash; Christine? \u00a0Christina? \u00a0Christen? \u00a0Help me out here,\u201d Tony fumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou already said it. \u00a0How did you even know?\u201d Chris demanded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat Christmas? \u00a0Your first name is Christmas?\u201d \u00a0Tony seemed truly surprised. \u00a0\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas!\u201d he said again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I did not mean that in reference to your name. \u00a0That\u2019s an expression I picked up from my mother years ago. \u00a0It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s time for the presents to be opened,\u201d Friday said. \u00a0Tony looked excited and jumped to attention, rubbing his hands together. \u00a0\u201cOk, green bean, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0He jumped ahead and grabbed everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Two hours later, the gifts had all been opened and the guests were showing them off to each other. \u00a0Loki turned to Chris to show her the Dictionary someone thought he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the worst gift I\u2019ve ever received, to be honest,\u201d he dismissed. \u00a0\u201cCome, where\u2019s your present?\u201d \u00a0Chris held up empty hands. \u00a0\u201cWait, no one got you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Chris dismissed. \u00a0\u201cNo one knows me here. \u00a0It\u2019s not like they expected the guest of a guest anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will not do. \u00a0The prettiest girl needs a gift.\u201d \u00a0Chris tried to dismiss the idea, but Loki already seemed to have a plan. \u00a0He waved his hand and a tiny fairy appeared in it. \u00a0\u201cThis is a wishing fairy. \u00a0They are extremely rare and reserved only for monarchs and their immediate family.\u201d \u00a0The tiny creature fluttered over to the stunned woman and perched on her shoulder. \u00a0It was whiter and brighter than the forest fairies. \u00a0\u201cIt will grant you one wish per day, but you must repeat the wish with the exact same wording three times so the fairy knows you are serious about the wish.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t know what to say. \u00a0The gift was so extraordinary that she didn\u2019t feel worthy of it, but she also didn\u2019t know how to give it back. \u00a0Still, she thought she might test it. \u00a0She put her hand over her mouth and leaned in toward the fairy, whispering. \u00a0She said the same phrase three times, then she stood up straight and looked at her beloved.</p><p>Loki looked down at his beaming speechless beauty. \u00a0\u201cMy merry little Miss Chris,\u201d he smiled and leaned down to give her a sweet kiss on the lips.</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0Loki looked at the wishing fairy. \u00a0\u201cWhy, the nerve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Loki,\u201d Chris said with the most heartfelt appreciation she could muster. \u00a0Loki wrapped a hand tightly around her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMerry Mischief everybody, and good night!\u201d \u00a0With that, he teleported them home.</p><p><a

Holiday Challenge</p><p>image by @maniploki</p>[[MORE]]<p>Chris exited the elevator in a short green dress and black leggings, orange fringe falling in her face again, arm looped around her boyfriend. \u00a0It had taken some effort, but she finally managed to convince Loki to come to the party. \u00a0He had found a nice green tunic and black slacks. \u00a0His shoulder-length raven curls looked immaculate against the tunic.<br></p><p>An old man in a veteran\u2019s cap and a young blond woman hurried into the elevator behind them. \u00a0People were everywhere, standing, chatting and holding drinks. \u00a0They passed a man with braces on his knees and back. \u00a0He was wearing nice slacks and a winter-themed polo shirt. \u00a0\u201cBoom, ya\u2019 lookin\u2019 fo dis?\u201d he said to a round of chuckles. \u00a0Apparently, his story had been funny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I didn\u2019t receive an invitation directly from Tony?\u201d Loki whined for the um-teenth time. \u00a0\u201cEvery one of them agreed I was as much an Avenger now as any of them. \u00a0Yet, they still don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your titles,\u201d Chris explained absently, shaking the hand of a tipsy dignitary. \u00a0\u201cLiesmith, god of mischief, bringer of chaos. \u00a0They\u2019re afraid of you.\u201d \u00a0She spoke lightly enough, but really she hoped her words would comfort the gloomy god. \u00a0She was seldom afforded the opportunity to attend such illustrious events and she was determined to enjoy herself, even if Loki didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, the god of thunder sounds equally as frightening, along with his less familiar name, cosmic oaf.\u201d \u00a0Loki smiled sardonically as they passed into the first room from the elevator hall. \u00a0They passed a wall-sized TV and several teenagers sitting on fluffy furniture.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Peter,\u201d a pretty girl cried as she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I can, Princess,\u201d Peter replied. \u00a0These two were holding controllers while the wall-screen showed a split view of two cars.<br><br>\u201cYeah, you show her Peter,\u201d said a chubby Asian, supporting his best friend. \u00a0A brown-haired youth playing with glowing red mist seemed to support the princess.</p><p>\u201cI should in with that group,\u201d Loki pouted as they left the teens behind. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m closer comparatively to their age than to yours. \u00a0Yet they never invite me to \u2013 what\u2019s the Earth vernacular \u2013 hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to invite you, but you kept turning them down, remember? \u00a0Something about them being immature and primitive?\u201d \u00a0Chris took a moment to bow to a dark-skinned king wearing a silver claw-shaped necklace. \u00a0Loki followed suit, and the man returned it, but he was on a mission, so they did not stop and talk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth of those statements are true,\u201d Loki spat. \u00a0\u201cIt still would have been nice to be asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well. \u00a0If it isn\u2019t the bringer of woes,\u201d said a strong-jawed blond man with pecs to rival Thor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Loki said as he inclined his head and scowled.</p><p>\u201cI saw Tony\u2019s invitation list,\u201d Steve said with accusation in his tone. \u00a0\u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here as Thor\u2019s pluses,\u201d Chris chimed in sweetly. \u00a0The man in the ugly Christmas sweater looked down at her as if noticing her for the first time.</p><p>\u201cOf course Thor would invite his brother,\u201d Steve said glancing back at Loki. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce me to your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you\u2019d stop judging me long enough to speak, you\u2019d already know her name,\u201d The silvertongue hissed. \u00a0The two men glared at each other, but the little woman put a quick stop to it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Chris,\u201d she introduced, holding out her hand. \u00a0Steve blushed and put on a little smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Chris. \u00a0I\u2019m Steve.\u201d \u00a0He shook her hand as a brown-haired man in another ugly Christmas sweater joined us. \u00a0He held a drink in a metal hand. \u00a0\u201cChris, this is my best friend, Bucky.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Bucky held out his hand to the small woman, who took it kindly. \u00a0He\u2019d been asleep for most of Loki\u2019s crimes against Earth. \u00a0More than that, he understood the horrific torments of being controlled or influenced with no way of fighting back. \u00a0Bucky smiled warmly as he held out a hand to the trickster. \u00a0Loki took the offered hand slowly. \u00a0When he saw the familiar pain behind his eyes, he offered a small smile himself. \u00a0The two seemed to become instant friends without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Chris, nice to meet you Loki,\u201d he said at last, then engaged the glowering blond.</p><p>\u201cAh, Thor!\u201d Chris exclaimed, heading across the room. \u00a0Loki turned to engage a small Chinese doctor. \u00a0Chris returned just as the doctor was excusing herself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot, I got you something!\u201d Chris said excitedly. \u00a0She pulled a green santa hat out of her bag. \u00a0It had white fur trimming and a large white fur puff on the end of a point.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with that?\u201d Loki asked, pouting again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPut it on! \u00a0It\u2019s a hat!\u201d \u00a0Chris explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing that. \u00a0I actually have a sense of fashion.\u201d \u00a0Loki walked away, ignoring the offered gift. \u00a0Chris followed, holding out the accessory.</p><p>They passed the renowned Natasha and Clint, who looked intense if a bit rosied, and ready to start comparing scars. \u00a0Natasha was still sober enough to afford the god a nasty glaring smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fashion sense won\u2019t be offended by this. \u00a0It perfectly matches your tunic,\u201d Chris said when Loki finally stopped and she caught up to him.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t respect me here,\u201d Loki sighed dramatically. \u00a0\u201cThey say I\u2019m one of them, but they don\u2019t respect me the same. \u00a0Am I really so different from Thor?\u201d \u00a0They walked away toward a table laden with goodies. \u00a0Chris did not hesitate to help herself. \u00a0\u201cIt was my Seidr that helped us escape in Alfheim. \u00a0It was my silver tongue that almost got us out of battle with the frost giants. \u00a0It was my daggers that saved us on Svartalheim. \u00a0The avengers wouldn\u2019t even exist if it wasn\u2019t for me, my cunning and strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Chris asked politely. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just, you really should try these cookies. \u00a0Billionaires get the best of everything.\u201d \u00a0Loki, with his sweet tooth, was not about to turn down offered treats. \u00a0When Chris saw he was in the mood to be handed things, she held out the hat again. \u00a0\u201cAnd you should try this hat on.\u201d \u00a0She smiled coyly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to wear that thing! \u00a0It looks like it was made for a child,\u201d Loki sneered, walking away from the table. \u00a0Chris grabbed one more cheese ball before following.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was made for an old man.\u201d \u00a0The little woman pointed out a fat man in a bright red suit lined with white fur, like the green cap. \u00a0A dark man with very short hair and a chiseled, pointy face gave a jolly laugh as he interacted with the actor. \u00a0Loki laughed inside, but kept a stern exterior. \u00a0Finally, he dragged his eyes away from the happy scene.</p><p>\u201cWell I am neither a child nor an old man,\u201d Loki pouted. \u00a0\u201cSo I don\u2019t think it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki, you\u2019re the oldest man I know besides your big brother. \u00a0Come on, just wear the santa hat for a little bit?\u201d \u00a0Loki shook his head and Chris lowered it. \u00a0The red-head gasped and pointed dramatically at someone\u2019s back. \u00a0\u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d \u00a0She was suddenly extremely excited, but Loki didn\u2019t know why. \u00a0For one thing, he didn\u2019t know who his girlfriend was referring to.</p><p>Chris shot off away from Loki and he followed her with his gaze. \u00a0She gestured wildly and glowed a beautiful apricot as she spoke. \u00a0Loki had to hide a smile behind his hand as he watched her, amazed at his luck to have her. \u00a0The woman she talked to stood tall, bald, straight like a warrior. \u00a0But she wore an obscene amount of glitter! \u00a0Really, it was amazing she wasn\u2019t shedding any of it!</p><p>Chris returned with her Christmas green eyes dazzling and Loki donned the hardest frown he\u2019d ever had to wear.</p><p>\u201cI wish someone would approach me like that,\u201d he moaned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be a sourpuss,\u201d Chris said with a playful pout. \u00a0She stroked the bridge of the mournful man\u2019s nose.</p><p>They ambled through the party, seeing this one and that one. \u00a0They greeted more veterans. \u00a0They passed through a sea of pretty girls. \u00a0Bruce was leaning against the wall studying the fireplace. \u00a0Loki continued to pout.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think nobody likes me?\u201d he asked pointedly. \u00a0Chris hummed in slight irritation but answered cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cRight now, nobody likes you because you\u2019re being a party pooper.\u201d \u00a0She decided to make another push before he asked about the idiom. \u00a0\u201cWhy not put the hat on? \u00a0You\u2019ll look more festive and cheerful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO.\u201d \u00a0He spoke firmly and she dropped her smile. \u00a0A noise at the far end of the room grabbed their attention.</p><p>\u201cOh, look! \u00a0It\u2019s your brother Thor,\u201d Chris beamed. \u00a0\u201cWant to go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that either,\u201d Loki hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got his Christmas hat on,\u201d Chris pointed out. \u00a0Sure enough, the blond muscle-bound god wore a red Christmas hat fringed in white, just like the green one. \u00a0\u201cHe sure looks cheerful,\u201d Chris said with intrigue.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Loki said. \u00a0His defenses were weakening.</p><p>\u201cSo festive, having so much fun,\u201d Chris continued with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I care?\u201d Loki feigned, cracking around the edges.</p><p>\u201cHe sure looks more festive than you.\u201d \u00a0That did it. \u00a0Loki broke completely.</p><p>\u201cGive me the infernal accessory,\u201d Loki growled, snatching it. \u00a0He thrust it on his head, the bobble knocking against his forehead. \u00a0\u201cThere. \u00a0How do I look?\u201d</p><p>Chris adjusted the hat so it sat on the side of head, less annoying, and kissed his sugar-pink lips with her Christmas red ones. \u00a0\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d she beamed.</p><p>After this, Loki thought he\u2019d better at least appear to make an effort, so he calculated how much sass and how much charm to approach the other guests. \u00a0A man who was far too jovial was performing Earth magic for a group of onlookers. \u00a0He must have been doing a good job, because they sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loki, want to go over there and show them what real magic is?\u201d \u00a0Chris suggested. \u00a0The trickster would have liked nothing more, but time was drawing short.</p><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to waste my Seidr on some silly party trick.\u201d \u00a0Chris shook her head sadly and they moved on. \u00a0A man with red skin and a golden cape caught Chris\u2019s attention next. \u00a0She greeted him, and Loki was polite enough about it. \u00a0The little woman was drawn easily into a conversation, however.</p><p>Loki crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the door frame to the next room. \u00a0This was the place and the time was now. \u00a0Loki\u2019s eyes shined with mischief and a cunning half smile spread across his lips. \u00a0It started in the green box under the Christmas tree. \u00a0Loki scrambled for Chris\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cDarling, come look at this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Ms. Light. \u00a0I\u2019ll go see what Wanda is doing.\u201d \u00a0The android disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou should try to get to know him,\u201d Chris explained. \u00a0\u201cHe thinks of your brother as one of his fathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him,\u201d Loki said distracted. \u00a0\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d \u00a0But no explanation was needed. \u00a0One of the presents began to glow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, fire,\u201d someone called. \u00a0\u201cI think that present\u2019s on fire!\u201d \u00a0Alarm spread through the crowd as they all turned to see the danger. \u00a0Tony turned from the bar with another drink in hand. \u00a0He hurried to the front of the room. \u00a0Sure enough, golden light grew slowly out of the green box reaching slowly upward.</p><p>\u201cFriday, why isn\u2019t the fire suppression system coming on?\u201d \u00a0Tony asked, pulling out a small transparent tablet.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI replied cooley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking right at it. \u00a0Check the Christmas tree,\u201d Tony demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI repeated. \u00a0He spotted Loki, who stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he barked, pointing a violent finger. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing something\u2026 wizard. \u00a0Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you accuse me?\u201d Loki replied nonchalantly. \u00a0Chris just smiled knowingly and held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t even invited, Reindeer Games. \u00a0What are you doing here?\u201d Tony looked even more livid than he was suspicious. \u00a0</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they all craned to see. \u00a0The glowing yellow light suddenly shot several feet into the air and sent little sparks everywhere!</p><p>\u201cFriday, talk to me,\u201d Tony demanded as he watched in horror. \u00a0Chris crossed her arms and glared at Loki with that knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the fun, Darling,\u201d he warned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust tell me it\u2019s not deadly,\u201d Chris demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow should I\u201d\u2013 but the look on her face made him reconsider. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not deadly.\u201d</p><p>They watched the show together. \u00a0The sparks grew in number, but where they lighted, nothing burned. \u00a0The box had finished blazing, but it hadn\u2019t burnt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d someone asked above the chaos. \u00a0More people from other rooms were rushing in to see the comotion. \u00a0One of the sparks hovered over a man\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0He and his neighbors strained to look at it. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not fire, it\u2019s an insect.\u201d \u00a0A few women shrieked. \u00a0Others were making observations. \u00a0</p><p>A woman with orange hair and lots of freckles known as Mrs. Stark held out her hand to catch one. \u00a0A golden light landed lightly on her palm and started to dance. \u00a0\u201cFairies? \u00a0Who brought fairies?\u201d \u00a0But she thought she already knew. \u00a0She looked around for the perpetrator. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre those wild forest fairies from Alfheim?\u201d \u00a0Thor asked, placing a heavy hand on Loki\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not! \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t trust mortals with the wild ones. \u00a0These ones have been domesticated. \u00a0It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d \u00a0Thor smirked.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care about safety?\u201d \u00a0One fluttered close to Chris\u2019s nose and she couldn\u2019t help but gasp and giggle. \u00a0Loki had had enough watching.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, these are fairies,\u201d he said loudly, stepping into the room with his arms spread for effect. \u00a0\u201cI bring them to you straight from the land of the light elves, Alfheim. \u00a0Domesticated Forest fairies. \u00a0Please enjoy! \u00a0And Merry Christmas from the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0There was a roaring round of applause as Loki beamed and bowed. \u00a0Tony pulled him out of the spotlight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Loki. \u00a0How\u2019d you get in here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe invited guests were allowed plus ones, Tony,\u201d Mrs. Stark interrupted, her words only slightly slurred.</p><p>\u201cThor invited me, since I was the only Avenger to not get an invitation. \u00a0And I invited my sweetheart, Chris.\u201d \u00a0He held out his hand and the little woman in green came to his side.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas,\u201d Tony chortled. \u00a0The woman with short orange hair glowered.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it when people use her full name,\u201d Loki warned.</p><p>\u201cHer full name? \u00a0Chris \u2013 Christine? \u00a0Christina? \u00a0Christen? \u00a0Help me out here,\u201d Tony fumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou already said it. \u00a0How did you even know?\u201d Chris demanded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat Christmas? \u00a0Your first name is Christmas?\u201d \u00a0Tony seemed truly surprised. \u00a0\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas!\u201d he said again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I did not mean that in reference to your name. \u00a0That\u2019s an expression I picked up from my mother years ago. \u00a0It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s time for the presents to be opened,\u201d Friday said. \u00a0Tony looked excited and jumped to attention, rubbing his hands together. \u00a0\u201cOk, green bean, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0He jumped ahead and grabbed everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Two hours later, the gifts had all been opened and the guests were showing them off to each other. \u00a0Loki turned to Chris to show her the Dictionary someone thought he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the worst gift I\u2019ve ever received, to be honest,\u201d he dismissed. \u00a0\u201cCome, where\u2019s your present?\u201d \u00a0Chris held up empty hands. \u00a0\u201cWait, no one got you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Chris dismissed. \u00a0\u201cNo one knows me here. \u00a0It\u2019s not like they expected the guest of a guest anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will not do. \u00a0The prettiest girl needs a gift.\u201d \u00a0Chris tried to dismiss the idea, but Loki already seemed to have a plan. \u00a0He waved his hand and a tiny fairy appeared in it. \u00a0\u201cThis is a wishing fairy. \u00a0They are extremely rare and reserved only for monarchs and their immediate family.\u201d \u00a0The tiny creature fluttered over to the stunned woman and perched on her shoulder. \u00a0It was whiter and brighter than the forest fairies. \u00a0\u201cIt will grant you one wish per day, but you must repeat the wish with the exact same wording three times so the fairy knows you are serious about the wish.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t know what to say. \u00a0The gift was so extraordinary that she didn\u2019t feel worthy of it, but she also didn\u2019t know how to give it back. \u00a0Still, she thought she might test it. \u00a0She put her hand over her mouth and leaned in toward the fairy, whispering. \u00a0She said the same phrase three times, then she stood up straight and looked at her beloved.</p><p>Loki looked down at his beaming speechless beauty. \u00a0\u201cMy merry little Miss Chris,\u201d he smiled and leaned down to give her a sweet kiss on the lips.</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0Loki looked at the wishing fairy. \u00a0\u201cWhy, the nerve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Loki,\u201d Chris said with the most heartfelt appreciation she could muster. \u00a0Loki wrapped a hand tightly around her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMerry Mischief everybody, and good night!\u201d \u00a0With that, he teleported them home.</p><p><a

Holiday Challenge</p><p>image by @maniploki</p>[[MORE]]<p>Chris exited the elevator in a short green dress and black leggings, orange fringe falling in her face again, arm looped around her boyfriend. \u00a0It had taken some effort, but she finally managed to convince Loki to come to the party. \u00a0He had found a nice green tunic and black slacks. \u00a0His shoulder-length raven curls looked immaculate against the tunic.<br></p><p>An old man in a veteran\u2019s cap and a young blond woman hurried into the elevator behind them. \u00a0People were everywhere, standing, chatting and holding drinks. \u00a0They passed a man with braces on his knees and back. \u00a0He was wearing nice slacks and a winter-themed polo shirt. \u00a0\u201cBoom, ya\u2019 lookin\u2019 fo dis?\u201d he said to a round of chuckles. \u00a0Apparently, his story had been funny.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I didn\u2019t receive an invitation directly from Tony?\u201d Loki whined for the um-teenth time. \u00a0\u201cEvery one of them agreed I was as much an Avenger now as any of them. \u00a0Yet, they still don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your titles,\u201d Chris explained absently, shaking the hand of a tipsy dignitary. \u00a0\u201cLiesmith, god of mischief, bringer of chaos. \u00a0They\u2019re afraid of you.\u201d \u00a0She spoke lightly enough, but really she hoped her words would comfort the gloomy god. \u00a0She was seldom afforded the opportunity to attend such illustrious events and she was determined to enjoy herself, even if Loki didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, the god of thunder sounds equally as frightening, along with his less familiar name, cosmic oaf.\u201d \u00a0Loki smiled sardonically as they passed into the first room from the elevator hall. \u00a0They passed a wall-sized TV and several teenagers sitting on fluffy furniture.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Peter,\u201d a pretty girl cried as she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I can, Princess,\u201d Peter replied. \u00a0These two were holding controllers while the wall-screen showed a split view of two cars.<br><br>\u201cYeah, you show her Peter,\u201d said a chubby Asian, supporting his best friend. \u00a0A brown-haired youth playing with glowing red mist seemed to support the princess.</p><p>\u201cI should in with that group,\u201d Loki pouted as they left the teens behind. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m closer comparatively to their age than to yours. \u00a0Yet they never invite me to \u2013 what\u2019s the Earth vernacular \u2013 hang out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey used to invite you, but you kept turning them down, remember? \u00a0Something about them being immature and primitive?\u201d \u00a0Chris took a moment to bow to a dark-skinned king wearing a silver claw-shaped necklace. \u00a0Loki followed suit, and the man returned it, but he was on a mission, so they did not stop and talk. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth of those statements are true,\u201d Loki spat. \u00a0\u201cIt still would have been nice to be asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well. \u00a0If it isn\u2019t the bringer of woes,\u201d said a strong-jawed blond man with pecs to rival Thor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Loki said as he inclined his head and scowled.</p><p>\u201cI saw Tony\u2019s invitation list,\u201d Steve said with accusation in his tone. \u00a0\u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here as Thor\u2019s pluses,\u201d Chris chimed in sweetly. \u00a0The man in the ugly Christmas sweater looked down at her as if noticing her for the first time.</p><p>\u201cOf course Thor would invite his brother,\u201d Steve said glancing back at Loki. \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce me to your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you\u2019d stop judging me long enough to speak, you\u2019d already know her name,\u201d The silvertongue hissed. \u00a0The two men glared at each other, but the little woman put a quick stop to it.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Chris,\u201d she introduced, holding out her hand. \u00a0Steve blushed and put on a little smile. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Chris. \u00a0I\u2019m Steve.\u201d \u00a0He shook her hand as a brown-haired man in another ugly Christmas sweater joined us. \u00a0He held a drink in a metal hand. \u00a0\u201cChris, this is my best friend, Bucky.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Bucky held out his hand to the small woman, who took it kindly. \u00a0He\u2019d been asleep for most of Loki\u2019s crimes against Earth. \u00a0More than that, he understood the horrific torments of being controlled or influenced with no way of fighting back. \u00a0Bucky smiled warmly as he held out a hand to the trickster. \u00a0Loki took the offered hand slowly. \u00a0When he saw the familiar pain behind his eyes, he offered a small smile himself. \u00a0The two seemed to become instant friends without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you Chris, nice to meet you Loki,\u201d he said at last, then engaged the glowering blond.</p><p>\u201cAh, Thor!\u201d Chris exclaimed, heading across the room. \u00a0Loki turned to engage a small Chinese doctor. \u00a0Chris returned just as the doctor was excusing herself. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot, I got you something!\u201d Chris said excitedly. \u00a0She pulled a green santa hat out of her bag. \u00a0It had white fur trimming and a large white fur puff on the end of a point.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with that?\u201d Loki asked, pouting again. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cPut it on! \u00a0It\u2019s a hat!\u201d \u00a0Chris explained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing that. \u00a0I actually have a sense of fashion.\u201d \u00a0Loki walked away, ignoring the offered gift. \u00a0Chris followed, holding out the accessory.</p><p>They passed the renowned Natasha and Clint, who looked intense if a bit rosied, and ready to start comparing scars. \u00a0Natasha was still sober enough to afford the god a nasty glaring smile.</p><p>\u201cYour fashion sense won\u2019t be offended by this. \u00a0It perfectly matches your tunic,\u201d Chris said when Loki finally stopped and she caught up to him.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t respect me here,\u201d Loki sighed dramatically. \u00a0\u201cThey say I\u2019m one of them, but they don\u2019t respect me the same. \u00a0Am I really so different from Thor?\u201d \u00a0They walked away toward a table laden with goodies. \u00a0Chris did not hesitate to help herself. \u00a0\u201cIt was my Seidr that helped us escape in Alfheim. \u00a0It was my silver tongue that almost got us out of battle with the frost giants. \u00a0It was my daggers that saved us on Svartalheim. \u00a0The avengers wouldn\u2019t even exist if it wasn\u2019t for me, my cunning and strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Chris asked politely. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just, you really should try these cookies. \u00a0Billionaires get the best of everything.\u201d \u00a0Loki, with his sweet tooth, was not about to turn down offered treats. \u00a0When Chris saw he was in the mood to be handed things, she held out the hat again. \u00a0\u201cAnd you should try this hat on.\u201d \u00a0She smiled coyly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to wear that thing! \u00a0It looks like it was made for a child,\u201d Loki sneered, walking away from the table. \u00a0Chris grabbed one more cheese ball before following.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was made for an old man.\u201d \u00a0The little woman pointed out a fat man in a bright red suit lined with white fur, like the green cap. \u00a0A dark man with very short hair and a chiseled, pointy face gave a jolly laugh as he interacted with the actor. \u00a0Loki laughed inside, but kept a stern exterior. \u00a0Finally, he dragged his eyes away from the happy scene.</p><p>\u201cWell I am neither a child nor an old man,\u201d Loki pouted. \u00a0\u201cSo I don\u2019t think it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoki, you\u2019re the oldest man I know besides your big brother. \u00a0Come on, just wear the santa hat for a little bit?\u201d \u00a0Loki shook his head and Chris lowered it. \u00a0The red-head gasped and pointed dramatically at someone\u2019s back. \u00a0\u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d \u00a0She was suddenly extremely excited, but Loki didn\u2019t know why. \u00a0For one thing, he didn\u2019t know who his girlfriend was referring to.</p><p>Chris shot off away from Loki and he followed her with his gaze. \u00a0She gestured wildly and glowed a beautiful apricot as she spoke. \u00a0Loki had to hide a smile behind his hand as he watched her, amazed at his luck to have her. \u00a0The woman she talked to stood tall, bald, straight like a warrior. \u00a0But she wore an obscene amount of glitter! \u00a0Really, it was amazing she wasn\u2019t shedding any of it!</p><p>Chris returned with her Christmas green eyes dazzling and Loki donned the hardest frown he\u2019d ever had to wear.</p><p>\u201cI wish someone would approach me like that,\u201d he moaned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be a sourpuss,\u201d Chris said with a playful pout. \u00a0She stroked the bridge of the mournful man\u2019s nose.</p><p>They ambled through the party, seeing this one and that one. \u00a0They greeted more veterans. \u00a0They passed through a sea of pretty girls. \u00a0Bruce was leaning against the wall studying the fireplace. \u00a0Loki continued to pout.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think nobody likes me?\u201d he asked pointedly. \u00a0Chris hummed in slight irritation but answered cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cRight now, nobody likes you because you\u2019re being a party pooper.\u201d \u00a0She decided to make another push before he asked about the idiom. \u00a0\u201cWhy not put the hat on? \u00a0You\u2019ll look more festive and cheerful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO.\u201d \u00a0He spoke firmly and she dropped her smile. \u00a0A noise at the far end of the room grabbed their attention.</p><p>\u201cOh, look! \u00a0It\u2019s your brother Thor,\u201d Chris beamed. \u00a0\u201cWant to go talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that either,\u201d Loki hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got his Christmas hat on,\u201d Chris pointed out. \u00a0Sure enough, the blond muscle-bound god wore a red Christmas hat fringed in white, just like the green one. \u00a0\u201cHe sure looks cheerful,\u201d Chris said with intrigue.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Loki said. \u00a0His defenses were weakening.</p><p>\u201cSo festive, having so much fun,\u201d Chris continued with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I care?\u201d Loki feigned, cracking around the edges.</p><p>\u201cHe sure looks more festive than you.\u201d \u00a0That did it. \u00a0Loki broke completely.</p><p>\u201cGive me the infernal accessory,\u201d Loki growled, snatching it. \u00a0He thrust it on his head, the bobble knocking against his forehead. \u00a0\u201cThere. \u00a0How do I look?\u201d</p><p>Chris adjusted the hat so it sat on the side of head, less annoying, and kissed his sugar-pink lips with her Christmas red ones. \u00a0\u201cYou look amazing,\u201d she beamed.</p><p>After this, Loki thought he\u2019d better at least appear to make an effort, so he calculated how much sass and how much charm to approach the other guests. \u00a0A man who was far too jovial was performing Earth magic for a group of onlookers. \u00a0He must have been doing a good job, because they sounded impressed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Loki, want to go over there and show them what real magic is?\u201d \u00a0Chris suggested. \u00a0The trickster would have liked nothing more, but time was drawing short.</p><p>\u201cNo. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to waste my Seidr on some silly party trick.\u201d \u00a0Chris shook her head sadly and they moved on. \u00a0A man with red skin and a golden cape caught Chris\u2019s attention next. \u00a0She greeted him, and Loki was polite enough about it. \u00a0The little woman was drawn easily into a conversation, however.</p><p>Loki crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the door frame to the next room. \u00a0This was the place and the time was now. \u00a0Loki\u2019s eyes shined with mischief and a cunning half smile spread across his lips. \u00a0It started in the green box under the Christmas tree. \u00a0Loki scrambled for Chris\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cDarling, come look at this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Ms. Light. \u00a0I\u2019ll go see what Wanda is doing.\u201d \u00a0The android disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou should try to get to know him,\u201d Chris explained. \u00a0\u201cHe thinks of your brother as one of his fathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him,\u201d Loki said distracted. \u00a0\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch what?\u201d \u00a0But no explanation was needed. \u00a0One of the presents began to glow. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey, fire,\u201d someone called. \u00a0\u201cI think that present\u2019s on fire!\u201d \u00a0Alarm spread through the crowd as they all turned to see the danger. \u00a0Tony turned from the bar with another drink in hand. \u00a0He hurried to the front of the room. \u00a0Sure enough, golden light grew slowly out of the green box reaching slowly upward.</p><p>\u201cFriday, why isn\u2019t the fire suppression system coming on?\u201d \u00a0Tony asked, pulling out a small transparent tablet.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI replied cooley.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking right at it. \u00a0Check the Christmas tree,\u201d Tony demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo fire is detected, Boss,\u201d The AI repeated. \u00a0He spotted Loki, who stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he barked, pointing a violent finger. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re doing something\u2026 wizard. \u00a0Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you accuse me?\u201d Loki replied nonchalantly. \u00a0Chris just smiled knowingly and held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t even invited, Reindeer Games. \u00a0What are you doing here?\u201d Tony looked even more livid than he was suspicious. \u00a0</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they all craned to see. \u00a0The glowing yellow light suddenly shot several feet into the air and sent little sparks everywhere!</p><p>\u201cFriday, talk to me,\u201d Tony demanded as he watched in horror. \u00a0Chris crossed her arms and glared at Loki with that knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the fun, Darling,\u201d he warned. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust tell me it\u2019s not deadly,\u201d Chris demanded.</p><p>\u201cHow should I\u201d\u2013 but the look on her face made him reconsider. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not deadly.\u201d</p><p>They watched the show together. \u00a0The sparks grew in number, but where they lighted, nothing burned. \u00a0The box had finished blazing, but it hadn\u2019t burnt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on,\u201d someone asked above the chaos. \u00a0More people from other rooms were rushing in to see the comotion. \u00a0One of the sparks hovered over a man\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0He and his neighbors strained to look at it. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not fire, it\u2019s an insect.\u201d \u00a0A few women shrieked. \u00a0Others were making observations. \u00a0</p><p>A woman with orange hair and lots of freckles known as Mrs. Stark held out her hand to catch one. \u00a0A golden light landed lightly on her palm and started to dance. \u00a0\u201cFairies? \u00a0Who brought fairies?\u201d \u00a0But she thought she already knew. \u00a0She looked around for the perpetrator. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre those wild forest fairies from Alfheim?\u201d \u00a0Thor asked, placing a heavy hand on Loki\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not! \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t trust mortals with the wild ones. \u00a0These ones have been domesticated. \u00a0It\u2019s safer that way.\u201d \u00a0Thor smirked.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care about safety?\u201d \u00a0One fluttered close to Chris\u2019s nose and she couldn\u2019t help but gasp and giggle. \u00a0Loki had had enough watching.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, these are fairies,\u201d he said loudly, stepping into the room with his arms spread for effect. \u00a0\u201cI bring them to you straight from the land of the light elves, Alfheim. \u00a0Domesticated Forest fairies. \u00a0Please enjoy! \u00a0And Merry Christmas from the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0There was a roaring round of applause as Loki beamed and bowed. \u00a0Tony pulled him out of the spotlight.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Loki. \u00a0How\u2019d you get in here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe invited guests were allowed plus ones, Tony,\u201d Mrs. Stark interrupted, her words only slightly slurred.</p><p>\u201cThor invited me, since I was the only Avenger to not get an invitation. \u00a0And I invited my sweetheart, Chris.\u201d \u00a0He held out his hand and the little woman in green came to his side.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas,\u201d Tony chortled. \u00a0The woman with short orange hair glowered.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it when people use her full name,\u201d Loki warned.</p><p>\u201cHer full name? \u00a0Chris \u2013 Christine? \u00a0Christina? \u00a0Christen? \u00a0Help me out here,\u201d Tony fumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou already said it. \u00a0How did you even know?\u201d Chris demanded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat Christmas? \u00a0Your first name is Christmas?\u201d \u00a0Tony seemed truly surprised. \u00a0\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Christmas!\u201d he said again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I did not mean that in reference to your name. \u00a0That\u2019s an expression I picked up from my mother years ago. \u00a0It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s time for the presents to be opened,\u201d Friday said. \u00a0Tony looked excited and jumped to attention, rubbing his hands together. \u00a0\u201cOk, green bean, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s the best gift giver on the planet!\u201d \u00a0He jumped ahead and grabbed everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>Two hours later, the gifts had all been opened and the guests were showing them off to each other. \u00a0Loki turned to Chris to show her the Dictionary someone thought he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the worst gift I\u2019ve ever received, to be honest,\u201d he dismissed. \u00a0\u201cCome, where\u2019s your present?\u201d \u00a0Chris held up empty hands. \u00a0\u201cWait, no one got you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Chris dismissed. \u00a0\u201cNo one knows me here. \u00a0It\u2019s not like they expected the guest of a guest anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will not do. \u00a0The prettiest girl needs a gift.\u201d \u00a0Chris tried to dismiss the idea, but Loki already seemed to have a plan. \u00a0He waved his hand and a tiny fairy appeared in it. \u00a0\u201cThis is a wishing fairy. \u00a0They are extremely rare and reserved only for monarchs and their immediate family.\u201d \u00a0The tiny creature fluttered over to the stunned woman and perched on her shoulder. \u00a0It was whiter and brighter than the forest fairies. \u00a0\u201cIt will grant you one wish per day, but you must repeat the wish with the exact same wording three times so the fairy knows you are serious about the wish.\u201d</p><p>Chris didn\u2019t know what to say. \u00a0The gift was so extraordinary that she didn\u2019t feel worthy of it, but she also didn\u2019t know how to give it back. \u00a0Still, she thought she might test it. \u00a0She put her hand over her mouth and leaned in toward the fairy, whispering. \u00a0She said the same phrase three times, then she stood up straight and looked at her beloved.</p><p>Loki looked down at his beaming speechless beauty. \u00a0\u201cMy merry little Miss Chris,\u201d he smiled and leaned down to give her a sweet kiss on the lips.</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u00a0Loki looked at the wishing fairy. \u00a0\u201cWhy, the nerve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Loki,\u201d Chris said with the most heartfelt appreciation she could muster. \u00a0Loki wrapped a hand tightly around her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMerry Mischief everybody, and good night!\u201d \u00a0With that, he teleported them home.</p><p><a

lookin&rsquo; fo dis?&rdquo; he said to a round of chuckles. &nbsp;Apparently, his story had been funny.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I didn&rsquo;t receive an invitation directly from Tony?&rdquo; Loki whined for the um-teenth time. &nbsp;&ldquo;Every one of them agreed I was as much an Avenger now as any of them. &nbsp;Yet, they still don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your titles,&rdquo; Chris explained absently, shaking the hand of a tipsy dignitary. &nbsp;&ldquo;Liesmith, god of mischief, bringer of chaos. &nbsp;They&rsquo;re afraid of you.&rdquo; &nbsp;She spoke lightly enough, but really she hoped her words would comfort the gloomy god. &nbsp;She was seldom afforded the opportunity to attend such illustrious events and she was determined to enjoy herself, even if Loki didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, well, the god of thunder sounds equally as frightening, along with his less familiar name, cosmic oaf.&rdquo; &nbsp;Loki smiled sardonically as they passed into the first room from the elevator hall. &nbsp;They passed a wall-sized TV and several teenagers sitting on fluffy furniture.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, Peter,&rdquo; a pretty girl cried as she laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I can, Princess,&rdquo; Peter replied. &nbsp;These two were holding controllers while the wall-screen showed a split view of two cars.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, you show her Peter,&rdquo; said a chubby Asian, supporting his best friend. &nbsp;A brown-haired youth playing with glowing red mist seemed to support the princess.</p><p>&ldquo;I should in with that group,&rdquo; Loki pouted as they left the teens behind. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m closer comparatively to their age than to yours. &nbsp;Yet they never invite me to &ndash; what&rsquo;s the Earth vernacular &ndash; hang out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They used to invite you, but you kept turning them down, remember? &nbsp;Something about them being immature and primitive?&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris took a moment to bow to a dark-skinned king wearing a silver claw-shaped necklace. &nbsp;Loki followed suit, and the man returned it, but he was on a mission, so they did not stop and talk. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Both of those statements are true,&rdquo; Loki spat. &nbsp;&ldquo;It still would have been nice to be asked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well. &nbsp;If it isn&rsquo;t the bringer of woes,&rdquo; said a strong-jawed blond man with pecs to rival Thor&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; Loki said as he inclined his head and scowled.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw Tony&rsquo;s invitation list,&rdquo; Steve said with accusation in his tone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who invited you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here as Thor&rsquo;s pluses,&rdquo; Chris chimed in sweetly. &nbsp;The man in the ugly Christmas sweater looked down at her as if noticing her for the first time.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Thor would invite his brother,&rdquo; Steve said glancing back at Loki. &nbsp;&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to introduce me to your date?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you&rsquo;d stop judging me long enough to speak, you&rsquo;d already know her name,&rdquo; The silvertongue hissed. &nbsp;The two men glared at each other, but the little woman put a quick stop to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Chris,&rdquo; she introduced, holding out her hand. &nbsp;Steve blushed and put on a little smile. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Chris. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m Steve.&rdquo; &nbsp;He shook her hand as a brown-haired man in another ugly Christmas sweater joined us. &nbsp;He held a drink in a metal hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Chris, this is my best friend, Bucky.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Bucky held out his hand to the small woman, who took it kindly. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been asleep for most of Loki&rsquo;s crimes against Earth. &nbsp;More than that, he understood the horrific torments of being controlled or influenced with no way of fighting back. &nbsp;Bucky smiled warmly as he held out a hand to the trickster. &nbsp;Loki took the offered hand slowly. &nbsp;When he saw the familiar pain behind his eyes, he offered a small smile himself. &nbsp;The two seemed to become instant friends without saying a word.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you Chris, nice to meet you Loki,&rdquo; he said at last, then engaged the glowering blond.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Thor!&rdquo; Chris exclaimed, heading across the room. &nbsp;Loki turned to engage a small Chinese doctor. &nbsp;Chris returned just as the doctor was excusing herself. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I totally forgot, I got you something!&rdquo; Chris said excitedly. &nbsp;She pulled a green santa hat out of her bag. &nbsp;It had white fur trimming and a large white fur puff on the end of a point.</p><p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to do with that?&rdquo; Loki asked, pouting again. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Put it on! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a hat!&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris explained.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wearing that. &nbsp;I actually have a sense of fashion.&rdquo; &nbsp;Loki walked away, ignoring the offered gift. &nbsp;Chris followed, holding out the accessory.</p><p>They passed the renowned Natasha and Clint, who looked intense if a bit rosied, and ready to start comparing scars. &nbsp;Natasha was still sober enough to afford the god a nasty glaring smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Your fashion sense won&rsquo;t be offended by this. &nbsp;It perfectly matches your tunic,&rdquo; Chris said when Loki finally stopped and she caught up to him.</p><p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t respect me here,&rdquo; Loki sighed dramatically. &nbsp;&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m one of them, but they don&rsquo;t respect me the same. &nbsp;Am I really so different from Thor?&rdquo; &nbsp;They walked away toward a table laden with goodies. &nbsp;Chris did not hesitate to help herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was my Seidr that helped us escape in Alfheim. &nbsp;It was my silver tongue that almost got us out of battle with the frost giants. &nbsp;It was my daggers that saved us on Svartalheim. &nbsp;The avengers wouldn&rsquo;t even exist if it wasn&rsquo;t for me, my cunning and strategy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you done yet?&rdquo; Chris asked politely. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, you really should try these cookies. &nbsp;Billionaires get the best of everything.&rdquo; &nbsp;Loki, with his sweet tooth, was not about to turn down offered treats. &nbsp;When Chris saw he was in the mood to be handed things, she held out the hat again. &nbsp;&ldquo;And you should try this hat on.&rdquo; &nbsp;She smiled coyly.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to wear that thing! &nbsp;It looks like it was made for a child,&rdquo; Loki sneered, walking away from the table. &nbsp;Chris grabbed one more cheese ball before following.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, it was made for an old man.&rdquo; &nbsp;The little woman pointed out a fat man in a bright red suit lined with white fur, like the green cap. &nbsp;A dark man with very short hair and a chiseled, pointy face gave a jolly laugh as he interacted with the actor. &nbsp;Loki laughed inside, but kept a stern exterior. &nbsp;Finally, he dragged his eyes away from the happy scene.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I am neither a child nor an old man,&rdquo; Loki pouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t think it was for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, you&rsquo;re the oldest man I know besides your big brother. &nbsp;Come on, just wear the santa hat for a little bit?&rdquo; &nbsp;Loki shook his head and Chris lowered it. &nbsp;The red-head gasped and pointed dramatically at someone&rsquo;s back. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that who I think it is?&rdquo; &nbsp;She was suddenly extremely excited, but Loki didn&rsquo;t know why. &nbsp;For one thing, he didn&rsquo;t know who his girlfriend was referring to.</p><p>Chris shot off away from Loki and he followed her with his gaze. &nbsp;She gestured wildly and glowed a beautiful apricot as she spoke. &nbsp;Loki had to hide a smile behind his hand as he watched her, amazed at his luck to have her. &nbsp;The woman she talked to stood tall, bald, straight like a warrior. &nbsp;But she wore an obscene amount of glitter! &nbsp;Really, it was amazing she wasn&rsquo;t shedding any of it!</p><p>Chris returned with her Christmas green eyes dazzling and Loki donned the hardest frown he&rsquo;d ever had to wear.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish someone would approach me like that,&rdquo; he moaned. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a sourpuss,&rdquo; Chris said with a playful pout. &nbsp;She stroked the bridge of the mournful man&rsquo;s nose.</p><p>They ambled through the party, seeing this one and that one. &nbsp;They greeted more veterans. &nbsp;They passed through a sea of pretty girls. &nbsp;Bruce was leaning against the wall studying the fireplace. &nbsp;Loki continued to pout.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think nobody likes me?&rdquo; he asked pointedly. &nbsp;Chris hummed in slight irritation but answered cheerfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Right now, nobody likes you because you&rsquo;re being a party pooper.&rdquo; &nbsp;She decided to make another push before he asked about the idiom. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why not put the hat on? &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll look more festive and cheerful!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO.&rdquo; &nbsp;He spoke firmly and she dropped her smile. &nbsp;A noise at the far end of the room grabbed their attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, look! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your brother Thor,&rdquo; Chris beamed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Want to go talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to do that either,&rdquo; Loki hissed.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his Christmas hat on,&rdquo; Chris pointed out. &nbsp;Sure enough, the blond muscle-bound god wore a red Christmas hat fringed in white, just like the green one. &nbsp;&ldquo;He sure looks cheerful,&rdquo; Chris said with intrigue.</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Loki said. &nbsp;His defenses were weakening.</p><p>&ldquo;So festive, having so much fun,&rdquo; Chris continued with a mischievous smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo; Loki feigned, cracking around the edges.</p><p>&ldquo;He sure looks more festive than you.&rdquo; &nbsp;That did it. &nbsp;Loki broke completely.</p><p>&ldquo;Give me the infernal accessory,&rdquo; Loki growled, snatching it. &nbsp;He thrust it on his head, the bobble knocking against his forehead. &nbsp;&ldquo;There. &nbsp;How do I look?&rdquo;</p><p>Chris adjusted the hat so it sat on the side of head, less annoying, and kissed his sugar-pink lips with her Christmas red ones. &nbsp;&ldquo;You look amazing,&rdquo; she beamed.</p><p>After this, Loki thought he&rsquo;d better at least appear to make an effort, so he calculated how much sass and how much charm to approach the other guests. &nbsp;A man who was far too jovial was performing Earth magic for a group of onlookers. &nbsp;He must have been doing a good job, because they sounded impressed.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Loki, want to go over there and show them what real magic is?&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris suggested. &nbsp;The trickster would have liked nothing more, but time was drawing short.</p><p>&ldquo;No. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not going to waste my Seidr on some silly party trick.&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris shook her head sadly and they moved on. &nbsp;A man with red skin and a golden cape caught Chris&rsquo;s attention next. &nbsp;She greeted him, and Loki was polite enough about it. &nbsp;The little woman was drawn easily into a conversation, however.</p><p>Loki crossed his arms over his chest and leaned against the door frame to the next room. &nbsp;This was the place and the time was now. &nbsp;Loki&rsquo;s eyes shined with mischief and a cunning half smile spread across his lips. &nbsp;It started in the green box under the Christmas tree. &nbsp;Loki scrambled for Chris&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, come look at this,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Ms. Light. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll go see what Wanda is doing.&rdquo; &nbsp;The android disappeared.</p><p>&ldquo;You should try to get to know him,&rdquo; Chris explained. &nbsp;&ldquo;He thinks of your brother as one of his fathers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good for him,&rdquo; Loki said distracted. &nbsp;&ldquo;Watch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Watch what?&rdquo; &nbsp;But no explanation was needed. &nbsp;One of the presents began to glow. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, fire,&rdquo; someone called. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think that present&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo; &nbsp;Alarm spread through the crowd as they all turned to see the danger. &nbsp;Tony turned from the bar with another drink in hand. &nbsp;He hurried to the front of the room. &nbsp;Sure enough, golden light grew slowly out of the green box reaching slowly upward.</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, why isn&rsquo;t the fire suppression system coming on?&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony asked, pulling out a small transparent tablet.</p><p>&ldquo;No fire is detected, Boss,&rdquo; The AI replied cooley.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking right at it. &nbsp;Check the Christmas tree,&rdquo; Tony demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;No fire is detected, Boss,&rdquo; The AI repeated. &nbsp;He spotted Loki, who stood up straight.</p><p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he barked, pointing a violent finger. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing something&hellip; wizard. &nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would you accuse me?&rdquo; Loki replied nonchalantly. &nbsp;Chris just smiled knowingly and held her tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t even invited, Reindeer Games. &nbsp;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Tony looked even more livid than he was suspicious. &nbsp;</p><p>There was a noise behind them and they all craned to see. &nbsp;The glowing yellow light suddenly shot several feet into the air and sent little sparks everywhere!</p><p>&ldquo;Friday, talk to me,&rdquo; Tony demanded as he watched in horror. &nbsp;Chris crossed her arms and glared at Loki with that knowing smile.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing the fun, Darling,&rdquo; he warned. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just tell me it&rsquo;s not deadly,&rdquo; Chris demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;How should I&rdquo;&ndash; but the look on her face made him reconsider. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not deadly.&rdquo;</p><p>They watched the show together. &nbsp;The sparks grew in number, but where they lighted, nothing burned. &nbsp;The box had finished blazing, but it hadn&rsquo;t burnt.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; someone asked above the chaos. &nbsp;More people from other rooms were rushing in to see the comotion. &nbsp;One of the sparks hovered over a man&rsquo;s shoulder. &nbsp;He and his neighbors strained to look at it. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fire, it&rsquo;s an insect.&rdquo; &nbsp;A few women shrieked. &nbsp;Others were making observations. &nbsp;</p><p>A woman with orange hair and lots of freckles known as Mrs. Stark held out her hand to catch one. &nbsp;A golden light landed lightly on her palm and started to dance. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fairies? &nbsp;Who brought fairies?&rdquo; &nbsp;But she thought she already knew. &nbsp;She looked around for the perpetrator. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Are those wild forest fairies from Alfheim?&rdquo; &nbsp;Thor asked, placing a heavy hand on Loki&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;No, of course not! &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust mortals with the wild ones. &nbsp;These ones have been domesticated. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s safer that way.&rdquo;

&nbsp;There was a roaring round of applause as Loki beamed and bowed. &nbsp;Tony pulled him out of the spotlight.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, Loki. &nbsp;How&rsquo;d you get in here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;The invited guests were allowed plus ones, Tony,&rdquo; Mrs. Stark interrupted, her words only slightly slurred.</p><p>&ldquo;Thor invited me, since I was the only Avenger to not get an invitation. &nbsp;And I invited my sweetheart, Chris.&rdquo; &nbsp;He held out his hand and the little woman in green came to his side.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Christmas,&rdquo;

Christine? &nbsp;Christina? &nbsp;Christen? &nbsp;Help me out here,&rdquo; Tony fumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;You already said it. &nbsp;How did you even know?&rdquo; Chris demanded. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What Christmas? &nbsp;Your first name is Christmas?&rdquo; &nbsp;Tony seemed truly surprised. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Christmas!&rdquo; he said again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I did not mean that in reference to your name. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s an expression I picked up from my mother years ago. &nbsp;It has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s time for the presents to be opened,&rdquo;

&nbsp;Chris tried to dismiss the idea, but Loki already seemed to have a plan. &nbsp;He waved his hand and a tiny fairy appeared in it. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a wishing fairy. &nbsp;They are extremely rare and reserved only for monarchs and their immediate family.&rdquo; &nbsp;The tiny creature fluttered over to the stunned woman and perched on her shoulder. &nbsp;It was whiter and brighter than the forest fairies. &nbsp;&ldquo;It will grant you one wish per day, but you must repeat the wish with the exact same wording three times so the fairy knows you are serious about the wish.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris didn&rsquo;t know what to say. &nbsp;The gift was so extraordinary that she didn&rsquo;t feel worthy of it, but she also didn&rsquo;t know how to give it back. &nbsp;Still, she thought she might test it. &nbsp;She put her hand over her mouth and leaned in toward the fairy, whispering. &nbsp;She said the same phrase three times, then she stood up straight and looked at her beloved.</p><p>Loki looked down at his beaming speechless beauty. &nbsp;&ldquo;My merry little Miss Chris,&rdquo; he smiled and leaned down to give her a sweet kiss on the lips.</p><p>&ldquo;It works,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; &nbsp;Loki looked at the wishing fairy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why, the nerve!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Loki,&rdquo; Chris said with the most heartfelt appreciation she could muster. &nbsp;Loki wrapped a hand tightly around her shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Merry Mischief everybody, and good night!&rdquo; &nbsp;With that, he teleported them home.</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZn5PmoQN_aXdM8uWazM9XQ\">@loki-the-fox</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m4K7iutRt0ib7aTV7pIHBIw\">@manip-loki</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVq8lc7IzAdigHbtv-gob9w\">@sovereignoblivious</a></p></p>",
