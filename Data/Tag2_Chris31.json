Just text me whatever you decide that you want, and I\u2019ll pick it up. I\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he said, kissing you goodbye. </p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d You watched as he walked out the door, grabbing your phone as you pondered what you wanted for dinner. </p><p><b>&hellip; </b></p><p>You were sitting on the couch when you heard the door open and slam shut. You turned around to see Chris carrying a bag of food, suspiciously quiet. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You stood up and moved to where Chris stood. You could see him roll his eyes, thinking about why he was mad to begin with. </p><p>\u201cI agree to do these shows to talk about the film. I don\u2019t mind talking about my family, I don\u2019t mind giving stories about my life, but why the hell do they always have to question how old you are,\u201d he began to rant. \u201cIt\u2019s never, \u2018Chris, how is y/n? Are you and y/n happy?\u2019 No, it\u2019s always \u2018why are you dating y/n when she\u2019s so many years younger than you?\u201d As if that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Chris,\u201d you told him, not wanting him to really get worked up over this. \u201cI\u2019d rather they talk about my age than anything else, honestly. Some people can be ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why should they talk about you at all if it\u2019s just going to be something rude? That\u2019s like if someone were to ask me to explain why Scott\u2019s gay, it\u2019s wrong and you gain nothing from knowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not the same,\u201d you told him. </p><p>\u201cHow? Please enlighten me,\u201d Chris asked, the annoyance obvious in his voice. </p><p>\u201cScott isn\u2019t dating you. Everyone will always treat me different because I\u2019m dating Chris Evans- Captain America. Just about any woman in the world wants to be with you, but I\u2019m with you. So they will do everything in their power to pick apart our relationship to make it seem wrong so they feel better about themselves. I will never be good enough for you because I\u2019m not them,\u201d you explained. \u201cI don\u2019t let it get to me because I know you. I know us, and I know that\u2019s what\u2019s more important.\u201d</p><p>You could see the emotions in Chris\u2019s eyes begin to calm as he took in your words. \u201cAren\u2019t you the one that should be telling me stuff like this, gramps?\u201d You joked. </p><p>\u201cWell obviously older doesn\u2019t always mean wiser,\u201d he said, moving to pull you into him. You rest your chin against his chest as you looked up at him, a smile on your face. </p><p>\u201cNah, girls are just wiser than men,\u201d you said, biting down on your lip. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t argue with that one,\u201d he replied with a chuckle before leaning down to kiss you. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll try to hold my temper next time, be a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d you said as you kissed him once more before pulling away from him and turning toward the bag of food. \u201cNow please tell me what I have to eat.\u201d</p><p><b>&hellip; </b></p><p>A few weeks later, Chris\u2019s episode of Stephen Colbert was being aired. You sat down on the couch, ready to watch and see the question that got Chris all worked up. </p><p>\u201cThank you for being with us tonight,\u201d Stephen said. </p><p>\u201cThank you for having me,\u201d Chris replied as he sat in the chair, unbuttoning his coat. </p><p>\u201cSo, Avengers Endgame,\u201d Stephen began to say. \u201cCan you tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Chris said, making the crowd laugh. \u201cWe can talk about the suits though. Mine has gotten remarkably more comfortable than the first few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear from a lot of the superhero actors. Why can\u2019t any of you have comfortable suits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, but we should definitely invest in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we wanted to know, you\u2019re not single, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Chris answered simply. </p><p>\u201cCan you tell us about her?\u201d Stephen asked as a picture of the two of you popped up. </p><p>\u201cHer name is y/n- there she is, gorgeous as ever. She\u2019s such an kind person. I\u2019m so happy to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to find some information about her before you came, and we found that she\u2019s actually significantly younger than you. Why are you okay being with someone that inexperienced?\u201d Stephen asked him, not seeing the wrong in his question. </p><p>You had to admit, you thought Chris was overreacting a bit to being asked about your age, but he really did ask in an upsetting way. Chris tried to hold his demeanor, but you knew he was upset with the question as soon as it came out of his mouth. </p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met. She doesn\u2019t care what others think about her, but I do. And I\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t disrespect her like you just did.\u201d You had a smile on your face as you watched him respond. He defended you while also staying calm and professional, and that\u2019s all you could ask of him. You really did appreciate that he cared about instances like this because it showed how he cared about you. </p><p>You turned off the tv and moved to your bedroom where Chris has already retired for the night. You crawled into your side of the bed, cuddling into him. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, placing a kiss to his skin. </p><p>\u201cI love you more,\u201d he said back causing a big smile to creep onto your face. </p>",

Mine has gotten remarkably more comfortable than the first few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I hear from a lot of the superhero actors. Why can\u2019t any of you have comfortable suits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man, but we should definitely invest in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we wanted to know, you\u2019re not single, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Chris answered simply. </p><p>\u201cCan you tell us about her?\u201d Stephen asked as a picture of the two of you popped up. </p><p>\u201cHer name is y/n- there she is, gorgeous as ever. She\u2019s such an kind person. I\u2019m so happy to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to find some information about her before you came, and we found that she\u2019s actually significantly younger than you. Why are you okay being with someone that inexperienced?\u201d Stephen asked him, not seeing the wrong in his question. </p><p>You had to admit, you thought Chris was overreacting a bit to being asked about your age, but he really did ask in an upsetting way. Chris tried to hold his demeanor, but you knew he was upset with the question as soon as it came out of his mouth. </p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met. She doesn\u2019t care what others think about her, but I do. And I\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t disrespect her like you just did.\u201d You had a smile on your face as you watched him respond. He defended you while also staying calm and professional, and that\u2019s all you could ask of him. You really did appreciate that he cared about instances like this because it showed how he cared about you. </p><p>You turned off the tv and moved to your bedroom where Chris has already retired for the night. You crawled into your side of the bed, cuddling into him. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered, placing a kiss to his skin. </p><p>\u201cI love you more,\u201d he said back causing a big smile to creep onto your face. </p>",

I don\u2019t mind talking about my family, I don\u2019t mind giving stories about my life, but why the hell do they always have to question how old you are,\u201d he began to rant. \u201cIt\u2019s never, \u2018Chris, how is y/n? Are you and y/n happy?\u2019 No, it\u2019s always \u2018why are you dating y/n when she\u2019s so many years younger than you?\u201d As if that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Chris,\u201d you told him, not wanting him to really get worked up over this. \u201cI\u2019d rather they talk about my age than anything else, honestly. Some people can be ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why should they talk about you at all if it\u2019s just going to be something rude?

Please enlighten me,\u201d Chris asked, the annoyance obvious in his voice. </p><p>\u201cScott isn\u2019t dating you. Everyone will always treat me different because I\u2019m dating Chris Evans- Captain America. Just about any woman in the world wants to be with you, but I\u2019m with you. So they will do everything in their power to pick apart our relationship to make it seem wrong so they feel better about themselves.
