One\ndidn\u2019t have a physical form for six thousand years without accumulating a\nlittle wear-and-tear<sup>1</sup>, or scratches in the paint, so to speak. It\nhad, however, been a remarkably long time since his last jaunt through the\nmetaphysical. Only ninety short years<sup>2</sup> after he had turned his back\non the Garden of Eden for the last time, Aziraphale had rather unfortunately\nfound himself on the wrong end of an extremely unpleasant man with an extremely\nsharp dagger. Not yet knowing what would happen to him, he hadn\u2019t thought to counter\nthe attack, or even so much as move out of the way; after all, this was no\nweapon of divine or infernal design.</p><p>So he had been in for a rather nasty shock when he found\nhimself face-to-face with Heaven\u2019s quartermaster and the prospect of filling\nout innumerable forms<sup>3 </sup>and joining a thankfully short waiting list\nbefore he could be assigned a new body.</p><p>It had been enough to put him off the whole experience, and\nas such, he had endeavoured to avoid it at all costs in subsequent years. </p><p>He had done a commendable job of it, all told. There had\nbeen a couple of instances that had required a little last-minute intervention\nof demonic origin, but he tried not to dwell on those too much. Not, to be\nclear, because he felt it was a sign of personal failure, but rather because\nthe memory tended to give him the ethereal equivalent of heart palpitations.</p><p>This instance had been somewhat different \u2013 for a start, the\nonly violence had been in the form of a remarkably irate witchfinder bellowing\nnonsense and waving his finger around. For another, though Aziraphale had found\nhimself unexpectedly flung from his physical form, there had been no real harm\ndone to it<sup>4</sup> which made for a nice change. That had been several\nhours and four continents ago. Now, Aziraphale was starting to feel really\nquite exhausted.</p><p>It ought not to have been possible, he thought glumly to\nhimself. After all, exhaustion was, by definition, something that happened on\nthe material plane. Cells didn\u2019t have enough energy or something \u2013 he\u2019d never\nbothered himself with the particulars, as he\u2019d never considered any scenario\nthat it might apply to him. Really it should have been impossible for angels to\nget tired. They were fonts of divine energy, beings that existed on an utterly\nseparate level from the concept of exhaustion.</p><p>And yet, here he was, wherever that may be now. Exhausted.\nIncorporeal. No idea how much time had passed since he\u2019d stepped into the\ncircle, and therefore no idea just how long the world had left before it all\nwent a bit explodey.</p><p>As a matter of fact, though he didn\u2019t know it at that\nprecise moment, the world had been due some explosions approximately twelve\nminutes earlier, right around the time he had decided to do the metaphysical\nequivalent of tucking up his feet on the sofa and dozing in front of\nSpringwatch with a cup of tea tilting precariously in his hand. He had hoped\nthat this would go some way to restoring him to the point that he could\ncontinue looking for a suitable body to inhabit that was both receptive and at\nleast in the same country as the antichrist.</p><p>So far it didn\u2019t appear to be making much of a difference,\nbut Aziraphale was persevering nonetheless.</p><p>He was persevering so hard, in fact, that it took him what\nmay have been a small eternity \u2013 but was probably closer to a few seconds \u2013 to\nnotice that he was no longer alone in the space between dimensions.</p><p>Being that the other entity also lacked a body, and didn\u2019t\nappear to be an angel, demon, or Crowley, Aziraphale was rather thrown by this.\n</p><p>\u201cUm. Hello,\u201d he said<sup>5</sup> finally. He didn\u2019t really\nknow what else to do.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d said the being, in what might have been a curious\nvoice if he had a voice, and Aziraphale had ears capable of discerning a\ncurious tone. \u201cWhat are you doing stuck all the way out here then?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale, in a pale imitation of his\nusual bluster. He found himself wishing rather desperately that he had hands\nwith which to fuss shirt cuffs, and a throat to clear. \u201cWell you see, that\u2019s a\nrather long story, and I\u2019m afraid we may be on something of a tight schedule \u2013\nat least, I think we are, it\u2019s rather hard to tell, but I would hope that even\nlike this I might have noticed if things had, er, got under way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d said the being. \u201cBut I think\nI probably know most of it already, and it\u2019s just boring if you hafta hear the\nsame story twice so close together. Are you Aziraphale then? \u2018Cause if you\u2019re\nnot then I really think you should just tell me now. I\u2019ve already got a lotta\nwork to do, and I really do need to find this Aziraphale person. Angel.\nAngel-person \u2013 sorry, that\u2019s not rude, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 well, no, I don\u2019t believe so,\u201d Aziraphale said. He\ncontemplated lying to the being for just a moment, but some deeply-held\ninstinct told him just what a bad idea that would be. \u201cAnd yes, I am\nAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d this time, Aziraphale was swamped with an\nimpression of relief. \u201cIt really would\u2019a been a pain if I\u2019d \u2018ad to go \u2018round\nlooking for you everywhere and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Aziraphale said blankly. He tried to take a moment to\nrally himself, and failed miserably. \u201cTo, to whom am I speaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m Adam Young,\u201d said the voice, apparently oblivious to the\ntailspin this sent Aziraphale\u2019s poor, racing mind into. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re\nlast on my list of things to get sorted out. First I thought I could just put\nyou back the way you was and that\u2019d be jus\u2019 fine, but then I reckon\u2019d I should\nprobably come get you sorted m\u2019self. \u2018s tricky trying to get someone back in a\nbody that dun\u2019t exist when they\u2019re not even in the right place for bodies to\nbe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly; he was suddenly, acutely\naware of the fact that he was speaking currently to the antichrist, a being\nthat could theoretically wipe him from this and every other plane of existence<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 <i>then</i> I thought it\u2019d be rude if I just went and\nstuck you back in the same body as you had, an\u2019 din\u2019t even ask if that body was\nokay for you,\u201d Adam continued, and he somehow managed to give the impression of\na wide-eyed, if not entirely earnest, stare. This was impressive given that he\nhad no body, no eyes to widen, and no actual voice to give any sort of\ninflection. Aziraphale would no doubt spend a great deal of time later being\nappropriately impressed, when he was no longer trying to metaphysically\nhyperventilate.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I was rather fond of it,\u201d Aziraphale managed. In\nthat precise moment, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you if that was the\ntruth or not<sup>7</sup>. He only knew that he really didn\u2019t want to be putting\nin any special requests for a new body to the antichrist, who had, as far as he\nwas able to tell, not made the world go all explodey.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Adam in something like relief. \u201cTha\u2019s good. Easy,\nI mean. I\u2019ll hafta drop you off where you were, though. Jus\u2019 gimme a sec, I\u2019ll\nget you all fixed up proper.\u201d</p><p>And it was so.</p><p>Aziraphale opened his eyes and took a deep, unnecessary\nbreath. He patted his hands over his coat, and tried to twist himself around to\nsee that everything was present and correct. He thought that perhaps his coat\nwas a little longer, his sweater a little more fitted, but it was really quite\nhard to tell in a body that was still relearning what synapses were.</p><p>He turned slowly, but there was no sign of Adam \u2013 not even a\nlingering hint of ozone to suggest he had ever been there. He then continued\nturning, struck by the sudden realisation that he had no idea where on God\u2019s\ngreen Earth he was.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, followed swiftly by a word that may have been\ninappropriate in polite company \u2013 but, if there is no polite company to hear an\ninappropriate word fall in a forest, who\u2019s to say if it made a sound?<sup>8</sup></p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In that particular instance, it had been rather more\ntear than wear</p><p>2 \u2013 Give or take. Functioning calendars had only existed for\nsixty of those years</p><p>3 \u2013 Literally \u2013 humans hadn\u2019t invented numbers that could\ncount that high yet</p><p>4 \u2013 Aside from the unfortunate dissembling down to the\nmolecular level</p><p>5 \u2013 He did not speak as you or I might speak, as he lacked\nthe mouth necessary to do so. He did not even speak as you or I might imagine a\nformless denizen of Heaven would speak. To properly explain how he spoke would\nrequire a number of PhDs that don\u2019t exist on Earth and an in-depth understanding\nof the wavelengths that angels generally occupy outside the range of human\nperception, of which this author has neither</p><p>6 \u2013 He was also rapidly coming to terms with the fact that he\nhad listed \u2018child murder\u2019 as one of the possible solutions to the problems the\nday had presented. Very low down the list, mind you, but still certainly\npresent</p><p>7 \u2013 It was</p><p>8 \u2013 It did</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>The world had been restored for thirteen hours, and a lone\ndemon had been drinking solidly for twelve of them. The first hour had been\ndedicated to transporting himself back to London, or it would have been a solid\nthirteen.</p><p>Crowley couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had been this\ndrunk. It might have been in what would later become Croatia, in 1132 BC. It\nmay have been just after the Library of Alexandria \u2013 ahem \u2013 was destroyed. It\nmight have been sometime in the First World War<sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Certainly, he thought, staring at the empty bottle in his\nhand with something a little like betrayal, he had never been this drunk on his\nown.</p><p>And really, that was the crux of the problem, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>He let his head fall back against the plush pile of the rug\nbeneath him. It didn\u2019t make quite the satisfying <i>thunk</i> he\u2019d been hoping\nfor \u2013 more of a dull <i>whoomf</i>, really \u2013 so he waved unsteady fingers\nthrough the air to miracle up the delayed sound himself. That, he thought, was\nmuch better suited to his current mood.</p><p>The bottle in his other hand had once contained a rather\nfine 1947 Cheval Blanc that he hadn\u2019t tasted a single mouthful of, and now\ncontained little more than dregs. He hadn\u2019t bothered to get himself more\nbottles \u2013 only continued refilling this one every time it got too light. He\u2019d\njust tried to do so again, and managed nothing more than a faint headache, so\nfor the moment he\u2019d abandoned the attempt.</p><p>Crowley blinked blearily up at the ceiling, and lamented his\ninability to fall into a drunken coma. </p><p>Oh, he could sleep well enough \u2013 Crowley was a <i>champion</i>\nsleeper. He was also quite proficient in naps, snoozes, dozes, and the sort of\nlazy Sunday afternoon in which you are sure that you <i>were</i> awake, yet\nsomehow cannot produce a single piece of evidence to prove it. All of that was,\nunfortunately, very different from a drunken coma. They all involved being able\nto keep his blessed mind quiet for longer than two consecutive minutes.</p><p>Aziraphale had been keeping this bottle back \u2013 not for any\nsort of special occasion, but just because it hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d said, felt like the\nright time to drink it. Aziraphale was very big on listening to those odd\nlittle feelings of his. It had been exactly where it had been kept since\nAziraphale first bought it in 1948, still perfectly preserved, and Crowley\u2019s\nhand shook a little when he had picked it up. </p><p>There had been a part of him \u2013 small, but far too loud to\ncompletely ignore \u2013 that had hoped to hear the angel\u2019s huff behind him. To have\nthe bottle snatched away because it <i>still isn\u2019t time for this one, my dear,\nreally</i>. </p><p>Of course, it had been only him, the bottle, and the books.\nHe\u2019d almost tried spilling a little wine over the first-edition Dante, but\nhadn\u2019t been able to bring himself to, in the end. As satisfying as it might\nhave been, it still seemed like a step too far. Besides, he thought to himself.\nBesides. It had been bad enough being allowed to drink the wine. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat he\u2019d do if there was no-one to stop him ruining the books<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s wandering mind found itself pondering if Adam had\nrecreated the holy sigil that Aziraphale had hidden beneath this very rug. He\ncould find out, he supposed, then groaned as even the thought of standing made\nhis head swim. It was harmless to him inactive, but he still didn\u2019t like the\nthought of sitting atop a direct line to the big guys Upstairs.</p><p>Even if he did have a few choice words for them.</p><p>But then again, there was always the chance it wasn\u2019t Heaven\nat all. The Metatron <i>had</i> looked terribly confused<sup>3</sup> when he\u2019d\ncornered them about Aziraphale on the airfield. Maybe they really hadn\u2019t had\nanything to do with it. Maybe they really didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><p>Which only left Downstairs, something that Crowley felt only\nmarginally more equipped to deal with. Beyond that, there really wasn\u2019t a\nterribly long list of suspects.</p><p>Only the divine or the infernal were capable of true\nsmiting. And if Adam hadn\u2019t brought Aziraphale back, then that meant there was\nnothing left of him <i>to</i> bring back. It was a fairly simple progression of\nlogic that managed to completely stall Crowley about halfway through. <i>Six\nthousand years </i>he thought bitterly. <i>Just enough time to get used to\nhaving someone around</i>.</p><p>He lifted to bottle to his lips again, grimacing as he\nremembered his last attempt to refill it. Well, there was no rush. He had time.\nIt wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>Pity, that.</p><p>Well, no. That wasn\u2019t fair. After all, this world had always\nbeen more or less decent to them \u2013 <i>him</i>. And he <i>had</i> just spent the\nlast eleven years trying to make sure it could continue being decent. It would\nhave been a terrible shame if, after all that effort, it had just gone and\nended anyway.</p><p>It was just that. That. That Crowley had always trusted in\nthe universe to look out for him, one way or another. And he\u2019d never quite\nrealised that, in all of his optimism, he\u2019d somehow included Aziraphale in that\nassumption. That if there was something out there in the universe watching his\nback \u2013 be it God, Satan, someone else, or just the natural forces of cosmic\nentropy \u2013 then it only made sense that it would be watching out for the angel\nas well.</p><p>Crowley had been wrong about a lot of things \u2013 one of the\nperils of having been around since the Beginning. </p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been as wrong about anything as he\nwas about this.</p><p>\u201cBugger thissss,\u201d he said, trying to sit himself back up for\njust a moment, before abandoning the attempt when all it did was offer him a\nbetter view of the empty room, a mug of congealed cocoa still sat on the desk,\nand the tartan throw on the back of the sofa that Crowley had foolishly miracled\nup as a joke and Aziraphale had loved without the slightest hint of shame or\nirony.</p><p>\u201cSssshould the burn the placccce back down! \u2018d sssserve you\nright, Zira! Leaving me to deal with the apocap \u2013 apolac \u2013 Armageddon all by\nmysssself! Going and getting yoursssself all, all <i>ssssmoted</i>!\u201d</p><p>Crowley waved his hand towards the general vicinity of the\nrest of the shop in a gesture that he thought was appropriately menacing.</p><p>\u201cI will! I\u2019ll sssset fire to every one of your biblessss!\nYou\u2019ll, you\u2019ll have to <i>thwart</i> me!\u201d</p><p>And nothing happened. The books didn\u2019t catch fire. Crowley\ndid not feel thwarted, so it was probably just that he was in no fit state to\nbe setting fire to anything. He was too busy, he realised in a distant sort of\nway, making an awful keening wail as he scrunched his eyes shut as tight as he\ncould.</p><p>It was probably a good thing he\u2019d been in some sort of shock\non the drive back. If he\u2019d felt anything like this, he likely would have hit\nmultiple other road users, and then Aziraphale, from wherever he was or wasn\u2019t,\nwould have been exceptionally disappointed. Well, there was every chance Aziraphale\nwas exceptionally disappointed with Crowley right now, but he couldn\u2019t find it\nin himself to care. If the angel wanted to judge him, he could come right on\nback to life and do it to Crowley\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He moaned, from somewhere low in his throat. \u201cWhat\ndid he ever do? He wasn\u2019t the one who, who invented original sin. He wasn\u2019t the\none who mucked up the Plan. What did he do to desssserve <i>thissss</i>?\u201d</p><p>Unless \u2013 unless that was the point. Punishment wasn\u2019t really\npunishment is you didn\u2019t exist to suffer through it. Maybe it wasn\u2019t about\nAziraphale. </p><p>After all, Crowley was the only one suffering now.</p><p>Both Heaven and Hell, while unimaginative, were both <i>very</i>\nkeen on the ironic sorts of punishments. And while Crowley would have liked to\nthink that a benevolent God wouldn\u2019t approve of this sort of thing, he knew\nenough about the Creator \u2013 and all the things that had been going on since free\nwill really took off \u2013 to know that God wouldn\u2019t really care. At least, not\nenough to interfere.</p><p><i>Ineffable</i>, as the bloody angel would have said.\nExcept he wasn\u2019t here to say it now, and Crowley certainly wasn\u2019t going to\nstoop so low.</p><p>Begging on the other hand, was a low he had stooped to\nbefore, and would no doubt stoop to again.</p><p>\u201cJusssst,\u201d he started, and tried to get the hissing under\ncontrol. It probably wasn\u2019t a very polite way to address the Almighty,\nespecially not for one of the fallen. \u201cJussst, please, ssend him back. He should\nget to ssee that hiss books are all okay, and that the world isss ssstill sssspinning.\nHe\u2019ssss done enough good for that. Thwarted enough wilessss. And all the onessss\nhe didn\u2019t were my fault, really. Ssssso bring him \u2013 jussst bring him <i>back</i>.\nI know we haven\u2019t spoke in a really long time, and I know we aren\u2019t on good\ntermsss, but pleassse. For, for <i>Zira\u2019s </i>ssssake, pleassse, he\u2019sss all I\u2019ve\ngot left, he\u2019sss the only good thing I still have from Heaven, pleassse-\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked and gave up, but Crowley didn\u2019t notice. He\nkept up his pleas silently, mouth working awkwardly around a tongue just a\nlittle too long and forked to pass for human. His ears were ringing unpleasantly\n\u2013 either a product of the wine, or the fact that praying was always more than a\nlittle bit painful for demons.</p><p>But the ringing in his ears just grew louder for a brief, horrible\ninstant, before cutting out entirely.</p><p>Had Crowley been even slightly less of a drunken, mumbling\nmess, he may well have realised that the ringing was actually the doorbell of\nthe shop. He may have heard the click as the door was unlocked, or the\nshuffling of fine leather shoes over the mat. He may not have, of course, but\nwe will never know for certain. The reality was, he <i>was</i> that drunk, and\nhe <i>didn\u2019t</i> hear any of those things. The very next thing he heard, in\nfact, was an aggrieved sigh, and a rather put upon <i>tsk</i>. Crowley didn\u2019t\nhave the willpower at that precise moment to lift an eyelid; but then, he\ndidn\u2019t have to. He was very well acquainted with that put upon <i>tsk</i>. His\nmouth stretched into something that may have resembled a smile if it hadn\u2019t\nwobbled quite so much.</p><p>\u201cSsssstill wassssn\u2019t time for it then? Angel?\u201d He asked,\nwaving the bottle haphazardly around. A couple of drops splashed on his face,\nand more than a couple onto his shirt. He gestured to miracle them away, but\ndidn\u2019t bother to look and see if it had worked.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019ve never seen you in such a state,\u201d said a\nfamiliar voice to his left. Crowley\u2019s grasp on the bottle slackened, and he\nfelt it fall from between his fingers. It must have landed on the thick, soft\nrug somewhere beside him, because he didn\u2019t hear it hit the floor.</p><p>Crowley loved that rug. He could write sonnets devoted to\nthat rug. That rug and him had been through something real over the last twelve\nhours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this, Crowley,\u201d said the voice that Crowley knew\nbetter than any sound in the world, a little nonsensically.</p><p><a>It wasn\u2019t Aziraphale. Crowley knew\nthat \u2013 had several very good arguments for it, in fact<sup>4</sup>.</a></p><p>He didn\u2019t open his\neyes to check.</p><p>There was a\nsensation like fingers \u2013 soft, warm, and a little bit heavenly \u2013 running over\nhis hair. Crowley tilted his face up towards it. He may not look so much like a\nserpent these days, but he\u2019d never quite managed to shake the habit of seeking\nout warmth. If Crowley really concentrated, he could almost muster up the\nfamiliar scent of bergamot and dust that always seemed to cling to Aziraphale\u2019s\novercoat.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear boy,\nwhat happened?\u201d Asked Hallucination Aziraphale. \u201cI was only gone a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yesssss</i>!\u201d\nCrowley hissed despite himself. \u201cA whole \u2013 a whole blesssssed day! The firsssst\nday of, of, of the resssst of my life!\u201d </p><p>He hiccupped. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t a sob.\nCrowley didn\u2019t sob.</p><p>He did, however, drunkenly\nhiccup several times in a row, hard enough to make his chest ache and his eyes\nwater. He swiped furiously at his face and tried to curl himself into as small\na ball as possible \u2013 had he been sober enough, he might have even shrunk\nhimself down into a little snake to curl up even smaller and tighter. Snakes\ndidn\u2019t have treacherous tear ducts. Snakes didn\u2019t drunkenly imagine their dead\npartner gently lifting their head into a soft lap. Clearly, snakes were the\nsuperior beings, and it had only taken him six thousand years, one heartbreak,\nand one stage of grief to notice.</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d the\nvoice was somehow both kind and exasperated, a combination that Aziraphale had\nmastered several millennia ago, and that Crowley had clearly thought worth committing\nto memory. \u201cWhatever is the matter? The world is safe, my books are all here,\nand don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see your car outside. Anything else can be dealt with,\nhm?\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his\nhead wordlessly, but didn\u2019t trust himself to open his mouth. He\u2019d only end up\nhiccupping again.</p><p>\u201cCrowley? Can you\nsober up, dear?\u201d Crowley shook his head again, but this time managed a sullen\nlittle,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to be sssssober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare I ask why not?\u201d Crowley had long known he was the only\ndemon with something even approaching an imagination, but even he hadn\u2019t\nrealised just how good it was. He was quite certain he\u2019d managed to get\nAziraphale\u2019s stuffy, put-upon eye-rolling spot on.</p><p>It seemed perfectly obvious to Crowley why he should never\nlike to be sober again, and as a hallucination of his, it should be perfectly\nclear to Aziraphale too. He opened one suspicious eye just a crack; just enough\nto see a vague outline that may have been angel-shaped with none of the defining\ncharacteristics. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go away if I\u2019m ssssober,\u201d he said wretchedly. The\nlap under his head jolted slightly, which was really rather rude for a\nhallucinatory pillow, in Crowley\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly will not!\u201d Ah, yes, the bluster. Crowley always\ndid like tempting that out. \u201cFor a start, we\u2019re in <i>my</i> shop! And if you\nwill insist on staying drunk, I should at least like to know why on <i>Earth</i>\nyou thought it was a good idea to pass out on my nice rug!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDin\u2019t pass out,\u201d Crowley muttered sullenly, and didn\u2019t\npoint out that it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying. His brain and any products\nthereof would already know that, so it would be rather pointless. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>,\u201d said the angel warningly. </p><p>Crowley found himself overtaken by another sudden bought of\nhiccups.</p><p>\u201cThey killed my best friend,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t hiss at\nall. The hand that had been moving gently through his hair all this time, almost\nunnoticed, stopped for a second and shook, before starting again.</p><p>\u201cOh. I \u2013 well. I\u2019m terribly sorry to hear that, dearest,\u201d\nAziraphale said, and there was no hint of temper in his voice. Just something a\nlittle shaky that Crowley couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on.</p><p>\u201cHave you,\u201d there was hesitance now, where there hadn\u2019t been\nbefore. Crowley tried to reach up, in the vague direction he thought the angel\u2019s\nface might be, to pat at it reassuringly. Aziraphale was de \u2013 gone. He had\nnothing to be hesitant about, and Crowley tried to tell him that with a few\nclumsy swipes of his hand against what may have been a cheek. It felt like\nAziraphale was smiling, but his voice was still sad when he spoke. \u201cHave you tried\nasking Adam about it? He\u2019s really a terribly nice boy, under all of the Hellish\npowers.\u201d</p><p>Crowley managed a despondent shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSilly angel,\u201d he said, and it was fond now. He had decided,\nrather abruptly, that he could be as fond as he wanted. As fond as he had been\nfor six thousand year, under it all. \u201cCan\u2019t bring back something that dun\u2019t\neven exisssst anymore. He already fixed everythin\u2019 elsssse.\u201d He leaned up a\nlittle, and whispered, like it was some great secret,</p><p>\u201cI even assssked <i>Death</i>.\u201d He spoke over Aziraphale\u2019s squawk\nof <i>you what?</i> \u201cAnd y\u2019know what he ssssaid? That it wassssn\u2019t hissss\njurissssdiction anymore!\u201d</p><p>It had seemed something of a win-win at the time. Either\nDeath could do something about it, or he would be annoyed enough by Crowley\u2019s\nasking to do something else \u2013 at that point, Crowley hadn\u2019t been too picky. But\nit seemed his luck had run out \u2013 his optimistic streak had carried him as far as\nit was able, and not an inch further.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me about them?\u201d Aziraphale asked after a\nlong moment of silence. His voice small, and tight, and something about it\nstruck Crowley as wrong, but his brain was far too slippery to grasp what it was.\n\u201cThey must have been something truly special, to go to all that trouble. It\nmight \u2013 help. Help you, I mean.\u201d Crowley thought this through hazily, before\nnodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if it really made sense or not, but he was willing to\ntrust that Aziraphale would know more about this sort of thing than him.</p><p>\u201cKnown \u2018m since \u2013 sssince \u2013 forever. Before time was a\nthing,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cCould alwaysss count on him. And we din\u2019t have a lot in\ncommon, but we had all the important bitsss! And bessssides, you get used to people\nbeing around that long.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale laughed, a little uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWell now, you don\u2019t need to tell <i>me</i> that, my dear,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cBut I do!\u201d This, suddenly, seemed extremely important.\nCrowley pushed himself into a popstion that could be described as upright, if\none were feeling particularly generous<sup>5</sup>, and peered unsteadily into\nthe hallucination\u2019s eyes for the first time. They looked exactly like\nAziraphale\u2019s, complete with the little golden flecks that always caught the\nlight no matter which way he turned. <i>Bless it</i> but Crowley was good.</p><p>\u201cI never told you when you were alive, and now you\u2019ve gone\nand got yourself smited, so I\u2019ll never get to tell you again!\u201d</p><p>He had the singular pleasure of watching Aziraphale\u2019s eyes\nwiden, and a flood of colour rush up his cheeks, but didn\u2019t pause to appreciate\nthe sight, steamrolling over any of Aziraphale\u2019s attempts to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou were -! You were -! Huffy, and you had terrible taste\nin clothes, and I don\u2019t underssssstand what\u2019ssss so great about Classic FM that\nyou thought it had to be the only blessed channel you can get all over the\ncountry no matter how bad the ssssignal is, and sssometimes I hiss my words\njust because I know it makessss you smile, and I\u2019ve never unkilled a duck for\nanyone else, and none of it <i>mattersss</i> because Heaven or Hell or\nssssomeone decided to off you, and now I\u2019m sssstuck here on my own waiting for\nthe next go-around!\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a long time. Long enough for Crowley to\nslump back into the hallucination\u2019s lap and close his eyes again. They really\nwere so heavy, and sore after the hiccups made them water so much.</p><p>\u201cI really do think,\u201d Aziraphale said finally, \u201cthat you\nought to sober up.\u201d</p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t dignify that with a response beyond\ntightening his grip on the angel\u2019s calf.</p><p>\u201cIt would be in both our best interests?\u201d</p><p>Still not worth a reply.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>That made him pause a little, before shaking his head\ndefinitively no.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of \u2013 <i>someone</i>.\u201d The next thing\nCrowley knew, he was up on his feet, through no effort or will of his own.\nThere were a pair of arms wrapped rather solidly around his shoulders, and his\nfeet didn\u2019t want to move separately, apparently rather stuck on the idea that\nthey used to be a tail. His face was pressed heavily against a soft shoulder\nthough, so Crowley didn\u2019t complain, even when the wool tickled at his nose. He\nhad the vague feeling that he was being led somewhere, but he\u2019d be redeemed if\nhe could figure out where.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Aziraphale muttered, right before he dropped\nCrowley onto what felt like a bed \u2013 just the right side of springy, with a\nthread count that was honestly sinful. Crowley appreciated it for an\nall-too-brief second before he found himself gripped by panic.</p><p>He surged up, and halfway off the bed before Aziraphale\ncaught him again.</p><p>\u201cNuh \u2013 no!\u201d If Crowley lay down in a bed, then he would go\nto sleep. If Crowley went to sleep, then he would wake up sober. If he woke up\nsober, then Aziraphale would be gone. \u201cNonono.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s voice was firm, though his hands\nwere soft as anything where they were untangling Crowley\u2019s from his lapels. \u201cYou\nneed a good night\u2019s sleep my dear, and to face the morning with a clear head. I\npromise you it\u2019ll all seem much brighter.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his head where it was mashed against the side\nof Aziraphale\u2019s neck. The neck in question moved a little as Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I stayed with you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>That\u2026 gave Crowley pause. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. If the\nhallucination stayed with him while he slept, and Crowley held on tightly\nenough \u2013 well, he was pretty solid now. As long as Crowley didn\u2019t move a single\nmuscle as he slept<sup>6</sup> then it should be fine.</p><p>There was something amiss with that logic, but exhaustion\nhad crept up on him like a snake in the grass, and Crowley found himself being\nlowered back to the bed once more, this time unresistingly.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d was the last thing Crowley heard as he\nslipped off to sleep. He had just enough time to congratulate himself on\nmiracling up such a comfortable bed \u2013 he\u2019d even managed to permeate the pillows\nwith Aziraphale\u2019s scent, which he desperately pressed his nose into now \u2013\nbefore he was swept away<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In fact it was none of these, for the simple reason that\nCrowley had never been this drunk before in his very long existence</p><p>2 \u2013 Well, no, that\u2019s not entirely accurate. He did know what\nhe would do. He was just trying very hard not to think on it too long, when he\nknew that Aziraphale would disapprove most vehemently</p><p>3 \u2013 Insofar as a being with no face made of holy fire can\nlook confused</p><p>4 \u2013 The arguments went as follows:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had been smited. Smote? Smiten? </p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale would never approve of Crowley\u2019s deep\nlove for this rug</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had never, in six thousand years,\nsounded quite so fondly exasperated, and he wouldn\u2019t have started now</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale was dead</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t started nagging him about the\nwine</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t mentioned the new books that\nCrowley had noticed Adam stocked</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale wasn\u2019t coming back</p><p>5 \u2013 As well as a little hazy on the meaning of the word \u2018upright\u2019</p><p>6 \u2013 Which was, fortunately, how he naturally slept anyway</p><p>7 \u2013 Had he stayed awake any longer, he would have realised\nthat not even he would have miracle up such a hideous quilt cover. He also\nwould have felt the careful, cleansing touch of a kiss against his forehead to\nkeep away bad dreams \u2013 though demons have no other kind. But he did not stay\nawake, and so he noticed nothing.</p>",

One\ndidn\u2019t have a physical form for six thousand years without accumulating a\nlittle wear-and-tear<sup>1</sup>, or scratches in the paint, so to speak. It\nhad, however, been a remarkably long time since his last jaunt through the\nmetaphysical. Only ninety short years<sup>2</sup> after he had turned his back\non the Garden of Eden for the last time, Aziraphale had rather unfortunately\nfound himself on the wrong end of an extremely unpleasant man with an extremely\nsharp dagger. Not yet knowing what would happen to him, he hadn\u2019t thought to counter\nthe attack, or even so much as move out of the way; after all, this was no\nweapon of divine or infernal design.</p><p>So he had been in for a rather nasty shock when he found\nhimself face-to-face with Heaven\u2019s quartermaster and the prospect of filling\nout innumerable forms<sup>3 </sup>and joining a thankfully short waiting list\nbefore he could be assigned a new body.</p><p>It had been enough to put him off the whole experience, and\nas such, he had endeavoured to avoid it at all costs in subsequent years. </p><p>He had done a commendable job of it, all told. There had\nbeen a couple of instances that had required a little last-minute intervention\nof demonic origin, but he tried not to dwell on those too much. Not, to be\nclear, because he felt it was a sign of personal failure, but rather because\nthe memory tended to give him the ethereal equivalent of heart palpitations.</p><p>This instance had been somewhat different \u2013 for a start, the\nonly violence had been in the form of a remarkably irate witchfinder bellowing\nnonsense and waving his finger around. For another, though Aziraphale had found\nhimself unexpectedly flung from his physical form, there had been no real harm\ndone to it<sup>4</sup> which made for a nice change. That had been several\nhours and four continents ago. Now, Aziraphale was starting to feel really\nquite exhausted.</p><p>It ought not to have been possible, he thought glumly to\nhimself. After all, exhaustion was, by definition, something that happened on\nthe material plane. Cells didn\u2019t have enough energy or something \u2013 he\u2019d never\nbothered himself with the particulars, as he\u2019d never considered any scenario\nthat it might apply to him. Really it should have been impossible for angels to\nget tired. They were fonts of divine energy, beings that existed on an utterly\nseparate level from the concept of exhaustion.</p><p>And yet, here he was, wherever that may be now. Exhausted.\nIncorporeal. No idea how much time had passed since he\u2019d stepped into the\ncircle, and therefore no idea just how long the world had left before it all\nwent a bit explodey.</p><p>As a matter of fact, though he didn\u2019t know it at that\nprecise moment, the world had been due some explosions approximately twelve\nminutes earlier, right around the time he had decided to do the metaphysical\nequivalent of tucking up his feet on the sofa and dozing in front of\nSpringwatch with a cup of tea tilting precariously in his hand. He had hoped\nthat this would go some way to restoring him to the point that he could\ncontinue looking for a suitable body to inhabit that was both receptive and at\nleast in the same country as the antichrist.</p><p>So far it didn\u2019t appear to be making much of a difference,\nbut Aziraphale was persevering nonetheless.</p><p>He was persevering so hard, in fact, that it took him what\nmay have been a small eternity \u2013 but was probably closer to a few seconds \u2013 to\nnotice that he was no longer alone in the space between dimensions.</p><p>Being that the other entity also lacked a body, and didn\u2019t\nappear to be an angel, demon, or Crowley, Aziraphale was rather thrown by this.\n</p><p>\u201cUm. Hello,\u201d he said<sup>5</sup> finally. He didn\u2019t really\nknow what else to do.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d said the being, in what might have been a curious\nvoice if he had a voice, and Aziraphale had ears capable of discerning a\ncurious tone. \u201cWhat are you doing stuck all the way out here then?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale, in a pale imitation of his\nusual bluster. He found himself wishing rather desperately that he had hands\nwith which to fuss shirt cuffs, and a throat to clear. \u201cWell you see, that\u2019s a\nrather long story, and I\u2019m afraid we may be on something of a tight schedule \u2013\nat least, I think we are, it\u2019s rather hard to tell, but I would hope that even\nlike this I might have noticed if things had, er, got under way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d said the being. \u201cBut I think\nI probably know most of it already, and it\u2019s just boring if you hafta hear the\nsame story twice so close together. Are you Aziraphale then? \u2018Cause if you\u2019re\nnot then I really think you should just tell me now. I\u2019ve already got a lotta\nwork to do, and I really do need to find this Aziraphale person. Angel.\nAngel-person \u2013 sorry, that\u2019s not rude, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 well, no, I don\u2019t believe so,\u201d Aziraphale said. He\ncontemplated lying to the being for just a moment, but some deeply-held\ninstinct told him just what a bad idea that would be. \u201cAnd yes, I am\nAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d this time, Aziraphale was swamped with an\nimpression of relief. \u201cIt really would\u2019a been a pain if I\u2019d \u2018ad to go \u2018round\nlooking for you everywhere and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Aziraphale said blankly. He tried to take a moment to\nrally himself, and failed miserably. \u201cTo, to whom am I speaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m Adam Young,\u201d said the voice, apparently oblivious to the\ntailspin this sent Aziraphale\u2019s poor, racing mind into. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re\nlast on my list of things to get sorted out. First I thought I could just put\nyou back the way you was and that\u2019d be jus\u2019 fine, but then I reckon\u2019d I should\nprobably come get you sorted m\u2019self. \u2018s tricky trying to get someone back in a\nbody that dun\u2019t exist when they\u2019re not even in the right place for bodies to\nbe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly; he was suddenly, acutely\naware of the fact that he was speaking currently to the antichrist, a being\nthat could theoretically wipe him from this and every other plane of existence<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 <i>then</i> I thought it\u2019d be rude if I just went and\nstuck you back in the same body as you had, an\u2019 din\u2019t even ask if that body was\nokay for you,\u201d Adam continued, and he somehow managed to give the impression of\na wide-eyed, if not entirely earnest, stare. This was impressive given that he\nhad no body, no eyes to widen, and no actual voice to give any sort of\ninflection. Aziraphale would no doubt spend a great deal of time later being\nappropriately impressed, when he was no longer trying to metaphysically\nhyperventilate.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I was rather fond of it,\u201d Aziraphale managed. In\nthat precise moment, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you if that was the\ntruth or not<sup>7</sup>. He only knew that he really didn\u2019t want to be putting\nin any special requests for a new body to the antichrist, who had, as far as he\nwas able to tell, not made the world go all explodey.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Adam in something like relief. \u201cTha\u2019s good. Easy,\nI mean. I\u2019ll hafta drop you off where you were, though. Jus\u2019 gimme a sec, I\u2019ll\nget you all fixed up proper.\u201d</p><p>And it was so.</p><p>Aziraphale opened his eyes and took a deep, unnecessary\nbreath. He patted his hands over his coat, and tried to twist himself around to\nsee that everything was present and correct. He thought that perhaps his coat\nwas a little longer, his sweater a little more fitted, but it was really quite\nhard to tell in a body that was still relearning what synapses were.</p><p>He turned slowly, but there was no sign of Adam \u2013 not even a\nlingering hint of ozone to suggest he had ever been there. He then continued\nturning, struck by the sudden realisation that he had no idea where on God\u2019s\ngreen Earth he was.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, followed swiftly by a word that may have been\ninappropriate in polite company \u2013 but, if there is no polite company to hear an\ninappropriate word fall in a forest, who\u2019s to say if it made a sound?<sup>8</sup></p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In that particular instance, it had been rather more\ntear than wear</p><p>2 \u2013 Give or take. Functioning calendars had only existed for\nsixty of those years</p><p>3 \u2013 Literally \u2013 humans hadn\u2019t invented numbers that could\ncount that high yet</p><p>4 \u2013 Aside from the unfortunate dissembling down to the\nmolecular level</p><p>5 \u2013 He did not speak as you or I might speak, as he lacked\nthe mouth necessary to do so. He did not even speak as you or I might imagine a\nformless denizen of Heaven would speak. To properly explain how he spoke would\nrequire a number of PhDs that don\u2019t exist on Earth and an in-depth understanding\nof the wavelengths that angels generally occupy outside the range of human\nperception, of which this author has neither</p><p>6 \u2013 He was also rapidly coming to terms with the fact that he\nhad listed \u2018child murder\u2019 as one of the possible solutions to the problems the\nday had presented. Very low down the list, mind you, but still certainly\npresent</p><p>7 \u2013 It was</p><p>8 \u2013 It did</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>The world had been restored for thirteen hours, and a lone\ndemon had been drinking solidly for twelve of them. The first hour had been\ndedicated to transporting himself back to London, or it would have been a solid\nthirteen.</p><p>Crowley couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had been this\ndrunk. It might have been in what would later become Croatia, in 1132 BC. It\nmay have been just after the Library of Alexandria \u2013 ahem \u2013 was destroyed. It\nmight have been sometime in the First World War<sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Certainly, he thought, staring at the empty bottle in his\nhand with something a little like betrayal, he had never been this drunk on his\nown.</p><p>And really, that was the crux of the problem, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>He let his head fall back against the plush pile of the rug\nbeneath him. It didn\u2019t make quite the satisfying <i>thunk</i> he\u2019d been hoping\nfor \u2013 more of a dull <i>whoomf</i>, really \u2013 so he waved unsteady fingers\nthrough the air to miracle up the delayed sound himself. That, he thought, was\nmuch better suited to his current mood.</p><p>The bottle in his other hand had once contained a rather\nfine 1947 Cheval Blanc that he hadn\u2019t tasted a single mouthful of, and now\ncontained little more than dregs. He hadn\u2019t bothered to get himself more\nbottles \u2013 only continued refilling this one every time it got too light. He\u2019d\njust tried to do so again, and managed nothing more than a faint headache, so\nfor the moment he\u2019d abandoned the attempt.</p><p>Crowley blinked blearily up at the ceiling, and lamented his\ninability to fall into a drunken coma. </p><p>Oh, he could sleep well enough \u2013 Crowley was a <i>champion</i>\nsleeper. He was also quite proficient in naps, snoozes, dozes, and the sort of\nlazy Sunday afternoon in which you are sure that you <i>were</i> awake, yet\nsomehow cannot produce a single piece of evidence to prove it. All of that was,\nunfortunately, very different from a drunken coma. They all involved being able\nto keep his blessed mind quiet for longer than two consecutive minutes.</p><p>Aziraphale had been keeping this bottle back \u2013 not for any\nsort of special occasion, but just because it hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d said, felt like the\nright time to drink it. Aziraphale was very big on listening to those odd\nlittle feelings of his. It had been exactly where it had been kept since\nAziraphale first bought it in 1948, still perfectly preserved, and Crowley\u2019s\nhand shook a little when he had picked it up. </p><p>There had been a part of him \u2013 small, but far too loud to\ncompletely ignore \u2013 that had hoped to hear the angel\u2019s huff behind him. To have\nthe bottle snatched away because it <i>still isn\u2019t time for this one, my dear,\nreally</i>. </p><p>Of course, it had been only him, the bottle, and the books.\nHe\u2019d almost tried spilling a little wine over the first-edition Dante, but\nhadn\u2019t been able to bring himself to, in the end. As satisfying as it might\nhave been, it still seemed like a step too far. Besides, he thought to himself.\nBesides. It had been bad enough being allowed to drink the wine. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat he\u2019d do if there was no-one to stop him ruining the books<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s wandering mind found itself pondering if Adam had\nrecreated the holy sigil that Aziraphale had hidden beneath this very rug. He\ncould find out, he supposed, then groaned as even the thought of standing made\nhis head swim. It was harmless to him inactive, but he still didn\u2019t like the\nthought of sitting atop a direct line to the big guys Upstairs.</p><p>Even if he did have a few choice words for them.</p><p>But then again, there was always the chance it wasn\u2019t Heaven\nat all. The Metatron <i>had</i> looked terribly confused<sup>3</sup> when he\u2019d\ncornered them about Aziraphale on the airfield. Maybe they really hadn\u2019t had\nanything to do with it. Maybe they really didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><p>Which only left Downstairs, something that Crowley felt only\nmarginally more equipped to deal with. Beyond that, there really wasn\u2019t a\nterribly long list of suspects.</p><p>Only the divine or the infernal were capable of true\nsmiting. And if Adam hadn\u2019t brought Aziraphale back, then that meant there was\nnothing left of him <i>to</i> bring back. It was a fairly simple progression of\nlogic that managed to completely stall Crowley about halfway through. <i>Six\nthousand years </i>he thought bitterly. <i>Just enough time to get used to\nhaving someone around</i>.</p><p>He lifted to bottle to his lips again, grimacing as he\nremembered his last attempt to refill it. Well, there was no rush. He had time.\nIt wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>Pity, that.</p><p>Well, no. That wasn\u2019t fair. After all, this world had always\nbeen more or less decent to them \u2013 <i>him</i>. And he <i>had</i> just spent the\nlast eleven years trying to make sure it could continue being decent. It would\nhave been a terrible shame if, after all that effort, it had just gone and\nended anyway.</p><p>It was just that. That. That Crowley had always trusted in\nthe universe to look out for him, one way or another. And he\u2019d never quite\nrealised that, in all of his optimism, he\u2019d somehow included Aziraphale in that\nassumption. That if there was something out there in the universe watching his\nback \u2013 be it God, Satan, someone else, or just the natural forces of cosmic\nentropy \u2013 then it only made sense that it would be watching out for the angel\nas well.</p><p>Crowley had been wrong about a lot of things \u2013 one of the\nperils of having been around since the Beginning. </p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been as wrong about anything as he\nwas about this.</p><p>\u201cBugger thissss,\u201d he said, trying to sit himself back up for\njust a moment, before abandoning the attempt when all it did was offer him a\nbetter view of the empty room, a mug of congealed cocoa still sat on the desk,\nand the tartan throw on the back of the sofa that Crowley had foolishly miracled\nup as a joke and Aziraphale had loved without the slightest hint of shame or\nirony.</p><p>\u201cSssshould the burn the placccce back down! \u2018d sssserve you\nright, Zira! Leaving me to deal with the apocap \u2013 apolac \u2013 Armageddon all by\nmysssself! Going and getting yoursssself all, all <i>ssssmoted</i>!\u201d</p><p>Crowley waved his hand towards the general vicinity of the\nrest of the shop in a gesture that he thought was appropriately menacing.</p><p>\u201cI will! I\u2019ll sssset fire to every one of your biblessss!\nYou\u2019ll, you\u2019ll have to <i>thwart</i> me!\u201d</p><p>And nothing happened. The books didn\u2019t catch fire. Crowley\ndid not feel thwarted, so it was probably just that he was in no fit state to\nbe setting fire to anything. He was too busy, he realised in a distant sort of\nway, making an awful keening wail as he scrunched his eyes shut as tight as he\ncould.</p><p>It was probably a good thing he\u2019d been in some sort of shock\non the drive back. If he\u2019d felt anything like this, he likely would have hit\nmultiple other road users, and then Aziraphale, from wherever he was or wasn\u2019t,\nwould have been exceptionally disappointed. Well, there was every chance Aziraphale\nwas exceptionally disappointed with Crowley right now, but he couldn\u2019t find it\nin himself to care. If the angel wanted to judge him, he could come right on\nback to life and do it to Crowley\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He moaned, from somewhere low in his throat. \u201cWhat\ndid he ever do? He wasn\u2019t the one who, who invented original sin. He wasn\u2019t the\none who mucked up the Plan. What did he do to desssserve <i>thissss</i>?\u201d</p><p>Unless \u2013 unless that was the point. Punishment wasn\u2019t really\npunishment is you didn\u2019t exist to suffer through it. Maybe it wasn\u2019t about\nAziraphale. </p><p>After all, Crowley was the only one suffering now.</p><p>Both Heaven and Hell, while unimaginative, were both <i>very</i>\nkeen on the ironic sorts of punishments. And while Crowley would have liked to\nthink that a benevolent God wouldn\u2019t approve of this sort of thing, he knew\nenough about the Creator \u2013 and all the things that had been going on since free\nwill really took off \u2013 to know that God wouldn\u2019t really care. At least, not\nenough to interfere.</p><p><i>Ineffable</i>, as the bloody angel would have said.\nExcept he wasn\u2019t here to say it now, and Crowley certainly wasn\u2019t going to\nstoop so low.</p><p>Begging on the other hand, was a low he had stooped to\nbefore, and would no doubt stoop to again.</p><p>\u201cJusssst,\u201d he started, and tried to get the hissing under\ncontrol. It probably wasn\u2019t a very polite way to address the Almighty,\nespecially not for one of the fallen. \u201cJussst, please, ssend him back. He should\nget to ssee that hiss books are all okay, and that the world isss ssstill sssspinning.\nHe\u2019ssss done enough good for that. Thwarted enough wilessss. And all the onessss\nhe didn\u2019t were my fault, really. Ssssso bring him \u2013 jussst bring him <i>back</i>.\nI know we haven\u2019t spoke in a really long time, and I know we aren\u2019t on good\ntermsss, but pleassse. For, for <i>Zira\u2019s </i>ssssake, pleassse, he\u2019sss all I\u2019ve\ngot left, he\u2019sss the only good thing I still have from Heaven, pleassse-\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked and gave up, but Crowley didn\u2019t notice. He\nkept up his pleas silently, mouth working awkwardly around a tongue just a\nlittle too long and forked to pass for human. His ears were ringing unpleasantly\n\u2013 either a product of the wine, or the fact that praying was always more than a\nlittle bit painful for demons.</p><p>But the ringing in his ears just grew louder for a brief, horrible\ninstant, before cutting out entirely.</p><p>Had Crowley been even slightly less of a drunken, mumbling\nmess, he may well have realised that the ringing was actually the doorbell of\nthe shop. He may have heard the click as the door was unlocked, or the\nshuffling of fine leather shoes over the mat. He may not have, of course, but\nwe will never know for certain. The reality was, he <i>was</i> that drunk, and\nhe <i>didn\u2019t</i> hear any of those things. The very next thing he heard, in\nfact, was an aggrieved sigh, and a rather put upon <i>tsk</i>. Crowley didn\u2019t\nhave the willpower at that precise moment to lift an eyelid; but then, he\ndidn\u2019t have to. He was very well acquainted with that put upon <i>tsk</i>. His\nmouth stretched into something that may have resembled a smile if it hadn\u2019t\nwobbled quite so much.</p><p>\u201cSsssstill wassssn\u2019t time for it then? Angel?\u201d He asked,\nwaving the bottle haphazardly around. A couple of drops splashed on his face,\nand more than a couple onto his shirt. He gestured to miracle them away, but\ndidn\u2019t bother to look and see if it had worked.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019ve never seen you in such a state,\u201d said a\nfamiliar voice to his left. Crowley\u2019s grasp on the bottle slackened, and he\nfelt it fall from between his fingers. It must have landed on the thick, soft\nrug somewhere beside him, because he didn\u2019t hear it hit the floor.</p><p>Crowley loved that rug. He could write sonnets devoted to\nthat rug. That rug and him had been through something real over the last twelve\nhours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this, Crowley,\u201d said the voice that Crowley knew\nbetter than any sound in the world, a little nonsensically.</p><p><a>It wasn\u2019t Aziraphale. Crowley knew\nthat \u2013 had several very good arguments for it, in fact<sup>4</sup>.</a></p><p>He didn\u2019t open his\neyes to check.</p><p>There was a\nsensation like fingers \u2013 soft, warm, and a little bit heavenly \u2013 running over\nhis hair. Crowley tilted his face up towards it. He may not look so much like a\nserpent these days, but he\u2019d never quite managed to shake the habit of seeking\nout warmth. If Crowley really concentrated, he could almost muster up the\nfamiliar scent of bergamot and dust that always seemed to cling to Aziraphale\u2019s\novercoat.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear boy,\nwhat happened?\u201d Asked Hallucination Aziraphale. \u201cI was only gone a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yesssss</i>!\u201d\nCrowley hissed despite himself. \u201cA whole \u2013 a whole blesssssed day! The firsssst\nday of, of, of the resssst of my life!\u201d </p><p>He hiccupped. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t a sob.\nCrowley didn\u2019t sob.</p><p>He did, however, drunkenly\nhiccup several times in a row, hard enough to make his chest ache and his eyes\nwater. He swiped furiously at his face and tried to curl himself into as small\na ball as possible \u2013 had he been sober enough, he might have even shrunk\nhimself down into a little snake to curl up even smaller and tighter. Snakes\ndidn\u2019t have treacherous tear ducts. Snakes didn\u2019t drunkenly imagine their dead\npartner gently lifting their head into a soft lap. Clearly, snakes were the\nsuperior beings, and it had only taken him six thousand years, one heartbreak,\nand one stage of grief to notice.</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d the\nvoice was somehow both kind and exasperated, a combination that Aziraphale had\nmastered several millennia ago, and that Crowley had clearly thought worth committing\nto memory. \u201cWhatever is the matter? The world is safe, my books are all here,\nand don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see your car outside. Anything else can be dealt with,\nhm?\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his\nhead wordlessly, but didn\u2019t trust himself to open his mouth. He\u2019d only end up\nhiccupping again.</p><p>\u201cCrowley? Can you\nsober up, dear?\u201d Crowley shook his head again, but this time managed a sullen\nlittle,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to be sssssober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare I ask why not?\u201d Crowley had long known he was the only\ndemon with something even approaching an imagination, but even he hadn\u2019t\nrealised just how good it was. He was quite certain he\u2019d managed to get\nAziraphale\u2019s stuffy, put-upon eye-rolling spot on.</p><p>It seemed perfectly obvious to Crowley why he should never\nlike to be sober again, and as a hallucination of his, it should be perfectly\nclear to Aziraphale too. He opened one suspicious eye just a crack; just enough\nto see a vague outline that may have been angel-shaped with none of the defining\ncharacteristics. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go away if I\u2019m ssssober,\u201d he said wretchedly. The\nlap under his head jolted slightly, which was really rather rude for a\nhallucinatory pillow, in Crowley\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly will not!\u201d Ah, yes, the bluster. Crowley always\ndid like tempting that out. \u201cFor a start, we\u2019re in <i>my</i> shop! And if you\nwill insist on staying drunk, I should at least like to know why on <i>Earth</i>\nyou thought it was a good idea to pass out on my nice rug!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDin\u2019t pass out,\u201d Crowley muttered sullenly, and didn\u2019t\npoint out that it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying. His brain and any products\nthereof would already know that, so it would be rather pointless. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>,\u201d said the angel warningly. </p><p>Crowley found himself overtaken by another sudden bought of\nhiccups.</p><p>\u201cThey killed my best friend,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t hiss at\nall. The hand that had been moving gently through his hair all this time, almost\nunnoticed, stopped for a second and shook, before starting again.</p><p>\u201cOh. I \u2013 well. I\u2019m terribly sorry to hear that, dearest,\u201d\nAziraphale said, and there was no hint of temper in his voice. Just something a\nlittle shaky that Crowley couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on.</p><p>\u201cHave you,\u201d there was hesitance now, where there hadn\u2019t been\nbefore. Crowley tried to reach up, in the vague direction he thought the angel\u2019s\nface might be, to pat at it reassuringly. Aziraphale was de \u2013 gone. He had\nnothing to be hesitant about, and Crowley tried to tell him that with a few\nclumsy swipes of his hand against what may have been a cheek. It felt like\nAziraphale was smiling, but his voice was still sad when he spoke. \u201cHave you tried\nasking Adam about it? He\u2019s really a terribly nice boy, under all of the Hellish\npowers.\u201d</p><p>Crowley managed a despondent shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSilly angel,\u201d he said, and it was fond now. He had decided,\nrather abruptly, that he could be as fond as he wanted. As fond as he had been\nfor six thousand year, under it all. \u201cCan\u2019t bring back something that dun\u2019t\neven exisssst anymore. He already fixed everythin\u2019 elsssse.\u201d He leaned up a\nlittle, and whispered, like it was some great secret,</p><p>\u201cI even assssked <i>Death</i>.\u201d He spoke over Aziraphale\u2019s squawk\nof <i>you what?</i> \u201cAnd y\u2019know what he ssssaid? That it wassssn\u2019t hissss\njurissssdiction anymore!\u201d</p><p>It had seemed something of a win-win at the time. Either\nDeath could do something about it, or he would be annoyed enough by Crowley\u2019s\nasking to do something else \u2013 at that point, Crowley hadn\u2019t been too picky. But\nit seemed his luck had run out \u2013 his optimistic streak had carried him as far as\nit was able, and not an inch further.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me about them?\u201d Aziraphale asked after a\nlong moment of silence. His voice small, and tight, and something about it\nstruck Crowley as wrong, but his brain was far too slippery to grasp what it was.\n\u201cThey must have been something truly special, to go to all that trouble. It\nmight \u2013 help. Help you, I mean.\u201d Crowley thought this through hazily, before\nnodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if it really made sense or not, but he was willing to\ntrust that Aziraphale would know more about this sort of thing than him.</p><p>\u201cKnown \u2018m since \u2013 sssince \u2013 forever. Before time was a\nthing,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cCould alwaysss count on him. And we din\u2019t have a lot in\ncommon, but we had all the important bitsss! And bessssides, you get used to people\nbeing around that long.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale laughed, a little uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWell now, you don\u2019t need to tell <i>me</i> that, my dear,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cBut I do!\u201d This, suddenly, seemed extremely important.\nCrowley pushed himself into a popstion that could be described as upright, if\none were feeling particularly generous<sup>5</sup>, and peered unsteadily into\nthe hallucination\u2019s eyes for the first time. They looked exactly like\nAziraphale\u2019s, complete with the little golden flecks that always caught the\nlight no matter which way he turned. <i>Bless it</i> but Crowley was good.</p><p>\u201cI never told you when you were alive, and now you\u2019ve gone\nand got yourself smited, so I\u2019ll never get to tell you again!\u201d</p><p>He had the singular pleasure of watching Aziraphale\u2019s eyes\nwiden, and a flood of colour rush up his cheeks, but didn\u2019t pause to appreciate\nthe sight, steamrolling over any of Aziraphale\u2019s attempts to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou were -! You were -! Huffy, and you had terrible taste\nin clothes, and I don\u2019t underssssstand what\u2019ssss so great about Classic FM that\nyou thought it had to be the only blessed channel you can get all over the\ncountry no matter how bad the ssssignal is, and sssometimes I hiss my words\njust because I know it makessss you smile, and I\u2019ve never unkilled a duck for\nanyone else, and none of it <i>mattersss</i> because Heaven or Hell or\nssssomeone decided to off you, and now I\u2019m sssstuck here on my own waiting for\nthe next go-around!\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a long time. Long enough for Crowley to\nslump back into the hallucination\u2019s lap and close his eyes again. They really\nwere so heavy, and sore after the hiccups made them water so much.</p><p>\u201cI really do think,\u201d Aziraphale said finally, \u201cthat you\nought to sober up.\u201d</p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t dignify that with a response beyond\ntightening his grip on the angel\u2019s calf.</p><p>\u201cIt would be in both our best interests?\u201d</p><p>Still not worth a reply.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>That made him pause a little, before shaking his head\ndefinitively no.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of \u2013 <i>someone</i>.\u201d The next thing\nCrowley knew, he was up on his feet, through no effort or will of his own.\nThere were a pair of arms wrapped rather solidly around his shoulders, and his\nfeet didn\u2019t want to move separately, apparently rather stuck on the idea that\nthey used to be a tail. His face was pressed heavily against a soft shoulder\nthough, so Crowley didn\u2019t complain, even when the wool tickled at his nose. He\nhad the vague feeling that he was being led somewhere, but he\u2019d be redeemed if\nhe could figure out where.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Aziraphale muttered, right before he dropped\nCrowley onto what felt like a bed \u2013 just the right side of springy, with a\nthread count that was honestly sinful. Crowley appreciated it for an\nall-too-brief second before he found himself gripped by panic.</p><p>He surged up, and halfway off the bed before Aziraphale\ncaught him again.</p><p>\u201cNuh \u2013 no!\u201d If Crowley lay down in a bed, then he would go\nto sleep. If Crowley went to sleep, then he would wake up sober. If he woke up\nsober, then Aziraphale would be gone. \u201cNonono.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s voice was firm, though his hands\nwere soft as anything where they were untangling Crowley\u2019s from his lapels. \u201cYou\nneed a good night\u2019s sleep my dear, and to face the morning with a clear head. I\npromise you it\u2019ll all seem much brighter.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his head where it was mashed against the side\nof Aziraphale\u2019s neck. The neck in question moved a little as Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I stayed with you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>That\u2026 gave Crowley pause. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. If the\nhallucination stayed with him while he slept, and Crowley held on tightly\nenough \u2013 well, he was pretty solid now. As long as Crowley didn\u2019t move a single\nmuscle as he slept<sup>6</sup> then it should be fine.</p><p>There was something amiss with that logic, but exhaustion\nhad crept up on him like a snake in the grass, and Crowley found himself being\nlowered back to the bed once more, this time unresistingly.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d was the last thing Crowley heard as he\nslipped off to sleep. He had just enough time to congratulate himself on\nmiracling up such a comfortable bed \u2013 he\u2019d even managed to permeate the pillows\nwith Aziraphale\u2019s scent, which he desperately pressed his nose into now \u2013\nbefore he was swept away<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In fact it was none of these, for the simple reason that\nCrowley had never been this drunk before in his very long existence</p><p>2 \u2013 Well, no, that\u2019s not entirely accurate. He did know what\nhe would do. He was just trying very hard not to think on it too long, when he\nknew that Aziraphale would disapprove most vehemently</p><p>3 \u2013 Insofar as a being with no face made of holy fire can\nlook confused</p><p>4 \u2013 The arguments went as follows:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had been smited. Smote? Smiten? </p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale would never approve of Crowley\u2019s deep\nlove for this rug</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had never, in six thousand years,\nsounded quite so fondly exasperated, and he wouldn\u2019t have started now</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale was dead</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t started nagging him about the\nwine</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t mentioned the new books that\nCrowley had noticed Adam stocked</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale wasn\u2019t coming back</p><p>5 \u2013 As well as a little hazy on the meaning of the word \u2018upright\u2019</p><p>6 \u2013 Which was, fortunately, how he naturally slept anyway</p><p>7 \u2013 Had he stayed awake any longer, he would have realised\nthat not even he would have miracle up such a hideous quilt cover. He also\nwould have felt the careful, cleansing touch of a kiss against his forehead to\nkeep away bad dreams \u2013 though demons have no other kind. But he did not stay\nawake, and so he noticed nothing.</p>",

At some point I\u2019ll clean this up and put it on AO3, but today is not that day, it\u2019s already late enough.</p><p>Follows book continuity closer than the series.\u00a0</p><p>Enjoy?</p>[[MORE]]<p>Aziraphale had been discorporated before, of course. One\ndidn\u2019t have a physical form for six thousand years without accumulating a\nlittle wear-and-tear<sup>1</sup>, or scratches in the paint, so to speak. It\nhad, however, been a remarkably long time since his last jaunt through the\nmetaphysical. Only ninety short years<sup>2</sup> after he had turned his back\non the Garden of Eden for the last time, Aziraphale had rather unfortunately\nfound himself on the wrong end of an extremely unpleasant man with an extremely\nsharp dagger. Not yet knowing what would happen to him, he hadn\u2019t thought to counter\nthe attack, or even so much as move out of the way; after all, this was no\nweapon of divine or infernal design.</p><p>So he had been in for a rather nasty shock when he found\nhimself face-to-face with Heaven\u2019s quartermaster and the prospect of filling\nout innumerable forms<sup>3 </sup>and joining a thankfully short waiting list\nbefore he could be assigned a new body.</p><p>It had been enough to put him off the whole experience, and\nas such, he had endeavoured to avoid it at all costs in subsequent years. </p><p>He had done a commendable job of it, all told. There had\nbeen a couple of instances that had required a little last-minute intervention\nof demonic origin, but he tried not to dwell on those too much. Not, to be\nclear, because he felt it was a sign of personal failure, but rather because\nthe memory tended to give him the ethereal equivalent of heart palpitations.</p><p>This instance had been somewhat different \u2013 for a start, the\nonly violence had been in the form of a remarkably irate witchfinder bellowing\nnonsense and waving his finger around. For another, though Aziraphale had found\nhimself unexpectedly flung from his physical form, there had been no real harm\ndone to it<sup>4</sup> which made for a nice change. That had been several\nhours and four continents ago. Now, Aziraphale was starting to feel really\nquite exhausted.</p><p>It ought not to have been possible, he thought glumly to\nhimself. After all, exhaustion was, by definition, something that happened on\nthe material plane. Cells didn\u2019t have enough energy or something \u2013 he\u2019d never\nbothered himself with the particulars, as he\u2019d never considered any scenario\nthat it might apply to him. Really it should have been impossible for angels to\nget tired. They were fonts of divine energy, beings that existed on an utterly\nseparate level from the concept of exhaustion.</p><p>And yet, here he was, wherever that may be now. Exhausted.\nIncorporeal. No idea how much time had passed since he\u2019d stepped into the\ncircle, and therefore no idea just how long the world had left before it all\nwent a bit explodey.</p><p>As a matter of fact, though he didn\u2019t know it at that\nprecise moment, the world had been due some explosions approximately twelve\nminutes earlier, right around the time he had decided to do the metaphysical\nequivalent of tucking up his feet on the sofa and dozing in front of\nSpringwatch with a cup of tea tilting precariously in his hand. He had hoped\nthat this would go some way to restoring him to the point that he could\ncontinue looking for a suitable body to inhabit that was both receptive and at\nleast in the same country as the antichrist.</p><p>So far it didn\u2019t appear to be making much of a difference,\nbut Aziraphale was persevering nonetheless.</p><p>He was persevering so hard, in fact, that it took him what\nmay have been a small eternity \u2013 but was probably closer to a few seconds \u2013 to\nnotice that he was no longer alone in the space between dimensions.</p><p>Being that the other entity also lacked a body, and didn\u2019t\nappear to be an angel, demon, or Crowley, Aziraphale was rather thrown by this.\n</p><p>\u201cUm. Hello,\u201d he said<sup>5</sup> finally. He didn\u2019t really\nknow what else to do.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d said the being, in what might have been a curious\nvoice if he had a voice, and Aziraphale had ears capable of discerning a\ncurious tone. \u201cWhat are you doing stuck all the way out here then?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>,\u201d said Aziraphale, in a pale imitation of his\nusual bluster. He found himself wishing rather desperately that he had hands\nwith which to fuss shirt cuffs, and a throat to clear. \u201cWell you see, that\u2019s a\nrather long story, and I\u2019m afraid we may be on something of a tight schedule \u2013\nat least, I think we are, it\u2019s rather hard to tell, but I would hope that even\nlike this I might have noticed if things had, er, got under way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d said the being. \u201cBut I think\nI probably know most of it already, and it\u2019s just boring if you hafta hear the\nsame story twice so close together. Are you Aziraphale then? \u2018Cause if you\u2019re\nnot then I really think you should just tell me now. I\u2019ve already got a lotta\nwork to do, and I really do need to find this Aziraphale person. Angel.\nAngel-person \u2013 sorry, that\u2019s not rude, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2013 well, no, I don\u2019t believe so,\u201d Aziraphale said. He\ncontemplated lying to the being for just a moment, but some deeply-held\ninstinct told him just what a bad idea that would be. \u201cAnd yes, I am\nAziraphale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d this time, Aziraphale was swamped with an\nimpression of relief. \u201cIt really would\u2019a been a pain if I\u2019d \u2018ad to go \u2018round\nlooking for you everywhere and when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Aziraphale said blankly. He tried to take a moment to\nrally himself, and failed miserably. \u201cTo, to whom am I speaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019m Adam Young,\u201d said the voice, apparently oblivious to the\ntailspin this sent Aziraphale\u2019s poor, racing mind into. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re\nlast on my list of things to get sorted out. First I thought I could just put\nyou back the way you was and that\u2019d be jus\u2019 fine, but then I reckon\u2019d I should\nprobably come get you sorted m\u2019self. \u2018s tricky trying to get someone back in a\nbody that dun\u2019t exist when they\u2019re not even in the right place for bodies to\nbe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Aziraphale said faintly; he was suddenly, acutely\naware of the fact that he was speaking currently to the antichrist, a being\nthat could theoretically wipe him from this and every other plane of existence<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>\u201cAn\u2019 <i>then</i> I thought it\u2019d be rude if I just went and\nstuck you back in the same body as you had, an\u2019 din\u2019t even ask if that body was\nokay for you,\u201d Adam continued, and he somehow managed to give the impression of\na wide-eyed, if not entirely earnest, stare. This was impressive given that he\nhad no body, no eyes to widen, and no actual voice to give any sort of\ninflection. Aziraphale would no doubt spend a great deal of time later being\nappropriately impressed, when he was no longer trying to metaphysically\nhyperventilate.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes I was rather fond of it,\u201d Aziraphale managed. In\nthat precise moment, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you if that was the\ntruth or not<sup>7</sup>. He only knew that he really didn\u2019t want to be putting\nin any special requests for a new body to the antichrist, who had, as far as he\nwas able to tell, not made the world go all explodey.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Adam in something like relief. \u201cTha\u2019s good. Easy,\nI mean. I\u2019ll hafta drop you off where you were, though. Jus\u2019 gimme a sec, I\u2019ll\nget you all fixed up proper.\u201d</p><p>And it was so.</p><p>Aziraphale opened his eyes and took a deep, unnecessary\nbreath. He patted his hands over his coat, and tried to twist himself around to\nsee that everything was present and correct. He thought that perhaps his coat\nwas a little longer, his sweater a little more fitted, but it was really quite\nhard to tell in a body that was still relearning what synapses were.</p><p>He turned slowly, but there was no sign of Adam \u2013 not even a\nlingering hint of ozone to suggest he had ever been there. He then continued\nturning, struck by the sudden realisation that he had no idea where on God\u2019s\ngreen Earth he was.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, followed swiftly by a word that may have been\ninappropriate in polite company \u2013 but, if there is no polite company to hear an\ninappropriate word fall in a forest, who\u2019s to say if it made a sound?<sup>8</sup></p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In that particular instance, it had been rather more\ntear than wear</p><p>2 \u2013 Give or take. Functioning calendars had only existed for\nsixty of those years</p><p>3 \u2013 Literally \u2013 humans hadn\u2019t invented numbers that could\ncount that high yet</p><p>4 \u2013 Aside from the unfortunate dissembling down to the\nmolecular level</p><p>5 \u2013 He did not speak as you or I might speak, as he lacked\nthe mouth necessary to do so. He did not even speak as you or I might imagine a\nformless denizen of Heaven would speak. To properly explain how he spoke would\nrequire a number of PhDs that don\u2019t exist on Earth and an in-depth understanding\nof the wavelengths that angels generally occupy outside the range of human\nperception, of which this author has neither</p><p>6 \u2013 He was also rapidly coming to terms with the fact that he\nhad listed \u2018child murder\u2019 as one of the possible solutions to the problems the\nday had presented. Very low down the list, mind you, but still certainly\npresent</p><p>7 \u2013 It was</p><p>8 \u2013 It did</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>The world had been restored for thirteen hours, and a lone\ndemon had been drinking solidly for twelve of them. The first hour had been\ndedicated to transporting himself back to London, or it would have been a solid\nthirteen.</p><p>Crowley couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had been this\ndrunk. It might have been in what would later become Croatia, in 1132 BC. It\nmay have been just after the Library of Alexandria \u2013 ahem \u2013 was destroyed. It\nmight have been sometime in the First World War<sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Certainly, he thought, staring at the empty bottle in his\nhand with something a little like betrayal, he had never been this drunk on his\nown.</p><p>And really, that was the crux of the problem, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>He let his head fall back against the plush pile of the rug\nbeneath him. It didn\u2019t make quite the satisfying <i>thunk</i> he\u2019d been hoping\nfor \u2013 more of a dull <i>whoomf</i>, really \u2013 so he waved unsteady fingers\nthrough the air to miracle up the delayed sound himself. That, he thought, was\nmuch better suited to his current mood.</p><p>The bottle in his other hand had once contained a rather\nfine 1947 Cheval Blanc that he hadn\u2019t tasted a single mouthful of, and now\ncontained little more than dregs. He hadn\u2019t bothered to get himself more\nbottles \u2013 only continued refilling this one every time it got too light. He\u2019d\njust tried to do so again, and managed nothing more than a faint headache, so\nfor the moment he\u2019d abandoned the attempt.</p><p>Crowley blinked blearily up at the ceiling, and lamented his\ninability to fall into a drunken coma. </p><p>Oh, he could sleep well enough \u2013 Crowley was a <i>champion</i>\nsleeper. He was also quite proficient in naps, snoozes, dozes, and the sort of\nlazy Sunday afternoon in which you are sure that you <i>were</i> awake, yet\nsomehow cannot produce a single piece of evidence to prove it. All of that was,\nunfortunately, very different from a drunken coma. They all involved being able\nto keep his blessed mind quiet for longer than two consecutive minutes.</p><p>Aziraphale had been keeping this bottle back \u2013 not for any\nsort of special occasion, but just because it hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d said, felt like the\nright time to drink it. Aziraphale was very big on listening to those odd\nlittle feelings of his. It had been exactly where it had been kept since\nAziraphale first bought it in 1948, still perfectly preserved, and Crowley\u2019s\nhand shook a little when he had picked it up. </p><p>There had been a part of him \u2013 small, but far too loud to\ncompletely ignore \u2013 that had hoped to hear the angel\u2019s huff behind him. To have\nthe bottle snatched away because it <i>still isn\u2019t time for this one, my dear,\nreally</i>. </p><p>Of course, it had been only him, the bottle, and the books.\nHe\u2019d almost tried spilling a little wine over the first-edition Dante, but\nhadn\u2019t been able to bring himself to, in the end. As satisfying as it might\nhave been, it still seemed like a step too far. Besides, he thought to himself.\nBesides. It had been bad enough being allowed to drink the wine. He didn\u2019t know\nwhat he\u2019d do if there was no-one to stop him ruining the books<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s wandering mind found itself pondering if Adam had\nrecreated the holy sigil that Aziraphale had hidden beneath this very rug. He\ncould find out, he supposed, then groaned as even the thought of standing made\nhis head swim. It was harmless to him inactive, but he still didn\u2019t like the\nthought of sitting atop a direct line to the big guys Upstairs.</p><p>Even if he did have a few choice words for them.</p><p>But then again, there was always the chance it wasn\u2019t Heaven\nat all. The Metatron <i>had</i> looked terribly confused<sup>3</sup> when he\u2019d\ncornered them about Aziraphale on the airfield. Maybe they really hadn\u2019t had\nanything to do with it. Maybe they really didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><p>Which only left Downstairs, something that Crowley felt only\nmarginally more equipped to deal with. Beyond that, there really wasn\u2019t a\nterribly long list of suspects.</p><p>Only the divine or the infernal were capable of true\nsmiting. And if Adam hadn\u2019t brought Aziraphale back, then that meant there was\nnothing left of him <i>to</i> bring back. It was a fairly simple progression of\nlogic that managed to completely stall Crowley about halfway through. <i>Six\nthousand years </i>he thought bitterly. <i>Just enough time to get used to\nhaving someone around</i>.</p><p>He lifted to bottle to his lips again, grimacing as he\nremembered his last attempt to refill it. Well, there was no rush. He had time.\nIt wasn\u2019t the end of the world.</p><p>Pity, that.</p><p>Well, no. That wasn\u2019t fair. After all, this world had always\nbeen more or less decent to them \u2013 <i>him</i>. And he <i>had</i> just spent the\nlast eleven years trying to make sure it could continue being decent. It would\nhave been a terrible shame if, after all that effort, it had just gone and\nended anyway.</p><p>It was just that. That. That Crowley had always trusted in\nthe universe to look out for him, one way or another. And he\u2019d never quite\nrealised that, in all of his optimism, he\u2019d somehow included Aziraphale in that\nassumption. That if there was something out there in the universe watching his\nback \u2013 be it God, Satan, someone else, or just the natural forces of cosmic\nentropy \u2013 then it only made sense that it would be watching out for the angel\nas well.</p><p>Crowley had been wrong about a lot of things \u2013 one of the\nperils of having been around since the Beginning. </p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever been as wrong about anything as he\nwas about this.</p><p>\u201cBugger thissss,\u201d he said, trying to sit himself back up for\njust a moment, before abandoning the attempt when all it did was offer him a\nbetter view of the empty room, a mug of congealed cocoa still sat on the desk,\nand the tartan throw on the back of the sofa that Crowley had foolishly miracled\nup as a joke and Aziraphale had loved without the slightest hint of shame or\nirony.</p><p>\u201cSssshould the burn the placccce back down! \u2018d sssserve you\nright, Zira! Leaving me to deal with the apocap \u2013 apolac \u2013 Armageddon all by\nmysssself! Going and getting yoursssself all, all <i>ssssmoted</i>!\u201d</p><p>Crowley waved his hand towards the general vicinity of the\nrest of the shop in a gesture that he thought was appropriately menacing.</p><p>\u201cI will! I\u2019ll sssset fire to every one of your biblessss!\nYou\u2019ll, you\u2019ll have to <i>thwart</i> me!\u201d</p><p>And nothing happened. The books didn\u2019t catch fire. Crowley\ndid not feel thwarted, so it was probably just that he was in no fit state to\nbe setting fire to anything. He was too busy, he realised in a distant sort of\nway, making an awful keening wail as he scrunched his eyes shut as tight as he\ncould.</p><p>It was probably a good thing he\u2019d been in some sort of shock\non the drive back. If he\u2019d felt anything like this, he likely would have hit\nmultiple other road users, and then Aziraphale, from wherever he was or wasn\u2019t,\nwould have been exceptionally disappointed. Well, there was every chance Aziraphale\nwas exceptionally disappointed with Crowley right now, but he couldn\u2019t find it\nin himself to care. If the angel wanted to judge him, he could come right on\nback to life and do it to Crowley\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He moaned, from somewhere low in his throat. \u201cWhat\ndid he ever do? He wasn\u2019t the one who, who invented original sin. He wasn\u2019t the\none who mucked up the Plan. What did he do to desssserve <i>thissss</i>?\u201d</p><p>Unless \u2013 unless that was the point. Punishment wasn\u2019t really\npunishment is you didn\u2019t exist to suffer through it. Maybe it wasn\u2019t about\nAziraphale. </p><p>After all, Crowley was the only one suffering now.</p><p>Both Heaven and Hell, while unimaginative, were both <i>very</i>\nkeen on the ironic sorts of punishments. And while Crowley would have liked to\nthink that a benevolent God wouldn\u2019t approve of this sort of thing, he knew\nenough about the Creator \u2013 and all the things that had been going on since free\nwill really took off \u2013 to know that God wouldn\u2019t really care. At least, not\nenough to interfere.</p><p><i>Ineffable</i>, as the bloody angel would have said.\nExcept he wasn\u2019t here to say it now, and Crowley certainly wasn\u2019t going to\nstoop so low.</p><p>Begging on the other hand, was a low he had stooped to\nbefore, and would no doubt stoop to again.</p><p>\u201cJusssst,\u201d he started, and tried to get the hissing under\ncontrol. It probably wasn\u2019t a very polite way to address the Almighty,\nespecially not for one of the fallen. \u201cJussst, please, ssend him back. He should\nget to ssee that hiss books are all okay, and that the world isss ssstill sssspinning.\nHe\u2019ssss done enough good for that. Thwarted enough wilessss. And all the onessss\nhe didn\u2019t were my fault, really. Ssssso bring him \u2013 jussst bring him <i>back</i>.\nI know we haven\u2019t spoke in a really long time, and I know we aren\u2019t on good\ntermsss, but pleassse. For, for <i>Zira\u2019s </i>ssssake, pleassse, he\u2019sss all I\u2019ve\ngot left, he\u2019sss the only good thing I still have from Heaven, pleassse-\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked and gave up, but Crowley didn\u2019t notice. He\nkept up his pleas silently, mouth working awkwardly around a tongue just a\nlittle too long and forked to pass for human. His ears were ringing unpleasantly\n\u2013 either a product of the wine, or the fact that praying was always more than a\nlittle bit painful for demons.</p><p>But the ringing in his ears just grew louder for a brief, horrible\ninstant, before cutting out entirely.</p><p>Had Crowley been even slightly less of a drunken, mumbling\nmess, he may well have realised that the ringing was actually the doorbell of\nthe shop. He may have heard the click as the door was unlocked, or the\nshuffling of fine leather shoes over the mat. He may not have, of course, but\nwe will never know for certain. The reality was, he <i>was</i> that drunk, and\nhe <i>didn\u2019t</i> hear any of those things. The very next thing he heard, in\nfact, was an aggrieved sigh, and a rather put upon <i>tsk</i>. Crowley didn\u2019t\nhave the willpower at that precise moment to lift an eyelid; but then, he\ndidn\u2019t have to. He was very well acquainted with that put upon <i>tsk</i>. His\nmouth stretched into something that may have resembled a smile if it hadn\u2019t\nwobbled quite so much.</p><p>\u201cSsssstill wassssn\u2019t time for it then? Angel?\u201d He asked,\nwaving the bottle haphazardly around. A couple of drops splashed on his face,\nand more than a couple onto his shirt. He gestured to miracle them away, but\ndidn\u2019t bother to look and see if it had worked.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019ve never seen you in such a state,\u201d said a\nfamiliar voice to his left. Crowley\u2019s grasp on the bottle slackened, and he\nfelt it fall from between his fingers. It must have landed on the thick, soft\nrug somewhere beside him, because he didn\u2019t hear it hit the floor.</p><p>Crowley loved that rug. He could write sonnets devoted to\nthat rug. That rug and him had been through something real over the last twelve\nhours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this, Crowley,\u201d said the voice that Crowley knew\nbetter than any sound in the world, a little nonsensically.</p><p><a>It wasn\u2019t Aziraphale. Crowley knew\nthat \u2013 had several very good arguments for it, in fact<sup>4</sup>.</a></p><p>He didn\u2019t open his\neyes to check.</p><p>There was a\nsensation like fingers \u2013 soft, warm, and a little bit heavenly \u2013 running over\nhis hair. Crowley tilted his face up towards it. He may not look so much like a\nserpent these days, but he\u2019d never quite managed to shake the habit of seeking\nout warmth. If Crowley really concentrated, he could almost muster up the\nfamiliar scent of bergamot and dust that always seemed to cling to Aziraphale\u2019s\novercoat.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear boy,\nwhat happened?\u201d Asked Hallucination Aziraphale. \u201cI was only gone a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yesssss</i>!\u201d\nCrowley hissed despite himself. \u201cA whole \u2013 a whole blesssssed day! The firsssst\nday of, of, of the resssst of my life!\u201d </p><p>He hiccupped. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t a sob.\nCrowley didn\u2019t sob.</p><p>He did, however, drunkenly\nhiccup several times in a row, hard enough to make his chest ache and his eyes\nwater. He swiped furiously at his face and tried to curl himself into as small\na ball as possible \u2013 had he been sober enough, he might have even shrunk\nhimself down into a little snake to curl up even smaller and tighter. Snakes\ndidn\u2019t have treacherous tear ducts. Snakes didn\u2019t drunkenly imagine their dead\npartner gently lifting their head into a soft lap. Clearly, snakes were the\nsuperior beings, and it had only taken him six thousand years, one heartbreak,\nand one stage of grief to notice.</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d the\nvoice was somehow both kind and exasperated, a combination that Aziraphale had\nmastered several millennia ago, and that Crowley had clearly thought worth committing\nto memory. \u201cWhatever is the matter? The world is safe, my books are all here,\nand don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see your car outside. Anything else can be dealt with,\nhm?\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his\nhead wordlessly, but didn\u2019t trust himself to open his mouth. He\u2019d only end up\nhiccupping again.</p><p>\u201cCrowley? Can you\nsober up, dear?\u201d Crowley shook his head again, but this time managed a sullen\nlittle,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to be sssssober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare I ask why not?\u201d Crowley had long known he was the only\ndemon with something even approaching an imagination, but even he hadn\u2019t\nrealised just how good it was. He was quite certain he\u2019d managed to get\nAziraphale\u2019s stuffy, put-upon eye-rolling spot on.</p><p>It seemed perfectly obvious to Crowley why he should never\nlike to be sober again, and as a hallucination of his, it should be perfectly\nclear to Aziraphale too. He opened one suspicious eye just a crack; just enough\nto see a vague outline that may have been angel-shaped with none of the defining\ncharacteristics. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go away if I\u2019m ssssober,\u201d he said wretchedly. The\nlap under his head jolted slightly, which was really rather rude for a\nhallucinatory pillow, in Crowley\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly will not!\u201d Ah, yes, the bluster. Crowley always\ndid like tempting that out. \u201cFor a start, we\u2019re in <i>my</i> shop! And if you\nwill insist on staying drunk, I should at least like to know why on <i>Earth</i>\nyou thought it was a good idea to pass out on my nice rug!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDin\u2019t pass out,\u201d Crowley muttered sullenly, and didn\u2019t\npoint out that it wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying. His brain and any products\nthereof would already know that, so it would be rather pointless. </p><p>\u201c<i>Crowley</i>,\u201d said the angel warningly. </p><p>Crowley found himself overtaken by another sudden bought of\nhiccups.</p><p>\u201cThey killed my best friend,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t hiss at\nall. The hand that had been moving gently through his hair all this time, almost\nunnoticed, stopped for a second and shook, before starting again.</p><p>\u201cOh. I \u2013 well. I\u2019m terribly sorry to hear that, dearest,\u201d\nAziraphale said, and there was no hint of temper in his voice. Just something a\nlittle shaky that Crowley couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on.</p><p>\u201cHave you,\u201d there was hesitance now, where there hadn\u2019t been\nbefore. Crowley tried to reach up, in the vague direction he thought the angel\u2019s\nface might be, to pat at it reassuringly. Aziraphale was de \u2013 gone. He had\nnothing to be hesitant about, and Crowley tried to tell him that with a few\nclumsy swipes of his hand against what may have been a cheek. It felt like\nAziraphale was smiling, but his voice was still sad when he spoke. \u201cHave you tried\nasking Adam about it? He\u2019s really a terribly nice boy, under all of the Hellish\npowers.\u201d</p><p>Crowley managed a despondent shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cSilly angel,\u201d he said, and it was fond now. He had decided,\nrather abruptly, that he could be as fond as he wanted. As fond as he had been\nfor six thousand year, under it all. \u201cCan\u2019t bring back something that dun\u2019t\neven exisssst anymore. He already fixed everythin\u2019 elsssse.\u201d He leaned up a\nlittle, and whispered, like it was some great secret,</p><p>\u201cI even assssked <i>Death</i>.\u201d He spoke over Aziraphale\u2019s squawk\nof <i>you what?</i> \u201cAnd y\u2019know what he ssssaid? That it wassssn\u2019t hissss\njurissssdiction anymore!\u201d</p><p>It had seemed something of a win-win at the time. Either\nDeath could do something about it, or he would be annoyed enough by Crowley\u2019s\nasking to do something else \u2013 at that point, Crowley hadn\u2019t been too picky. But\nit seemed his luck had run out \u2013 his optimistic streak had carried him as far as\nit was able, and not an inch further.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me about them?\u201d Aziraphale asked after a\nlong moment of silence. His voice small, and tight, and something about it\nstruck Crowley as wrong, but his brain was far too slippery to grasp what it was.\n\u201cThey must have been something truly special, to go to all that trouble. It\nmight \u2013 help. Help you, I mean.\u201d Crowley thought this through hazily, before\nnodding. He wasn\u2019t sure if it really made sense or not, but he was willing to\ntrust that Aziraphale would know more about this sort of thing than him.</p><p>\u201cKnown \u2018m since \u2013 sssince \u2013 forever. Before time was a\nthing,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cCould alwaysss count on him. And we din\u2019t have a lot in\ncommon, but we had all the important bitsss! And bessssides, you get used to people\nbeing around that long.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale laughed, a little uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cWell now, you don\u2019t need to tell <i>me</i> that, my dear,\u201d\nhe said.</p><p>\u201cBut I do!\u201d This, suddenly, seemed extremely important.\nCrowley pushed himself into a popstion that could be described as upright, if\none were feeling particularly generous<sup>5</sup>, and peered unsteadily into\nthe hallucination\u2019s eyes for the first time. They looked exactly like\nAziraphale\u2019s, complete with the little golden flecks that always caught the\nlight no matter which way he turned. <i>Bless it</i> but Crowley was good.</p><p>\u201cI never told you when you were alive, and now you\u2019ve gone\nand got yourself smited, so I\u2019ll never get to tell you again!\u201d</p><p>He had the singular pleasure of watching Aziraphale\u2019s eyes\nwiden, and a flood of colour rush up his cheeks, but didn\u2019t pause to appreciate\nthe sight, steamrolling over any of Aziraphale\u2019s attempts to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou were -! You were -! Huffy, and you had terrible taste\nin clothes, and I don\u2019t underssssstand what\u2019ssss so great about Classic FM that\nyou thought it had to be the only blessed channel you can get all over the\ncountry no matter how bad the ssssignal is, and sssometimes I hiss my words\njust because I know it makessss you smile, and I\u2019ve never unkilled a duck for\nanyone else, and none of it <i>mattersss</i> because Heaven or Hell or\nssssomeone decided to off you, and now I\u2019m sssstuck here on my own waiting for\nthe next go-around!\u201d</p><p>It was quiet for a long time. Long enough for Crowley to\nslump back into the hallucination\u2019s lap and close his eyes again. They really\nwere so heavy, and sore after the hiccups made them water so much.</p><p>\u201cI really do think,\u201d Aziraphale said finally, \u201cthat you\nought to sober up.\u201d</p><p>Crowley didn\u2019t dignify that with a response beyond\ntightening his grip on the angel\u2019s calf.</p><p>\u201cIt would be in both our best interests?\u201d</p><p>Still not worth a reply.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>That made him pause a little, before shaking his head\ndefinitively no.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of \u2013 <i>someone</i>.\u201d The next thing\nCrowley knew, he was up on his feet, through no effort or will of his own.\nThere were a pair of arms wrapped rather solidly around his shoulders, and his\nfeet didn\u2019t want to move separately, apparently rather stuck on the idea that\nthey used to be a tail. His face was pressed heavily against a soft shoulder\nthough, so Crowley didn\u2019t complain, even when the wool tickled at his nose. He\nhad the vague feeling that he was being led somewhere, but he\u2019d be redeemed if\nhe could figure out where.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Aziraphale muttered, right before he dropped\nCrowley onto what felt like a bed \u2013 just the right side of springy, with a\nthread count that was honestly sinful. Crowley appreciated it for an\nall-too-brief second before he found himself gripped by panic.</p><p>He surged up, and halfway off the bed before Aziraphale\ncaught him again.</p><p>\u201cNuh \u2013 no!\u201d If Crowley lay down in a bed, then he would go\nto sleep. If Crowley went to sleep, then he would wake up sober. If he woke up\nsober, then Aziraphale would be gone. \u201cNonono.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d Aziraphale\u2019s voice was firm, though his hands\nwere soft as anything where they were untangling Crowley\u2019s from his lapels. \u201cYou\nneed a good night\u2019s sleep my dear, and to face the morning with a clear head. I\npromise you it\u2019ll all seem much brighter.\u201d</p><p>Crowley shook his head where it was mashed against the side\nof Aziraphale\u2019s neck. The neck in question moved a little as Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I stayed with you?\u201d He asked.</p><p>That\u2026 gave Crowley pause. He hadn\u2019t thought of that. If the\nhallucination stayed with him while he slept, and Crowley held on tightly\nenough \u2013 well, he was pretty solid now. As long as Crowley didn\u2019t move a single\nmuscle as he slept<sup>6</sup> then it should be fine.</p><p>There was something amiss with that logic, but exhaustion\nhad crept up on him like a snake in the grass, and Crowley found himself being\nlowered back to the bed once more, this time unresistingly.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d was the last thing Crowley heard as he\nslipped off to sleep. He had just enough time to congratulate himself on\nmiracling up such a comfortable bed \u2013 he\u2019d even managed to permeate the pillows\nwith Aziraphale\u2019s scent, which he desperately pressed his nose into now \u2013\nbefore he was swept away<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>\u00a0*****</p><p>1 \u2013 In fact it was none of these, for the simple reason that\nCrowley had never been this drunk before in his very long existence</p><p>2 \u2013 Well, no, that\u2019s not entirely accurate. He did know what\nhe would do. He was just trying very hard not to think on it too long, when he\nknew that Aziraphale would disapprove most vehemently</p><p>3 \u2013 Insofar as a being with no face made of holy fire can\nlook confused</p><p>4 \u2013 The arguments went as follows:</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had been smited. Smote? Smiten? </p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale would never approve of Crowley\u2019s deep\nlove for this rug</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale had never, in six thousand years,\nsounded quite so fondly exasperated, and he wouldn\u2019t have started now</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale was dead</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t started nagging him about the\nwine</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale hadn\u2019t mentioned the new books that\nCrowley had noticed Adam stocked</p><p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAziraphale wasn\u2019t coming back</p><p>5 \u2013 As well as a little hazy on the meaning of the word \u2018upright\u2019</p><p>6 \u2013 Which was, fortunately, how he naturally slept anyway</p><p>7 \u2013 Had he stayed awake any longer, he would have realised\nthat not even he would have miracle up such a hideous quilt cover. He also\nwould have felt the careful, cleansing touch of a kiss against his forehead to\nkeep away bad dreams \u2013 though demons have no other kind. But he did not stay\nawake, and so he noticed nothing.</p>",
                "content": "<p>I call this - what if Aziraphale hadn&rsquo;t managed to find a body in time for the apocalypse, AKA I wanted an excuse to make Crowley sad and drunk. There is a happy ending, which I will get around to writing soon. Ish.</p><p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCJgVV1rCP76_HMRm9qj5IA\">@i-swear-this-is-for-homework</a> for listening to me ramble. At some point I&rsquo;ll clean this up and put it on AO3, but today is not that day, it&rsquo;s already late enough.</p><p>Follows book continuity closer than the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy?</p><p>Aziraphale had been discorporated before, of course. One\ndidn&rsquo;t have a physical form for six thousand years without accumulating a\nlittle wear-and-tear<sup>1</sup>, or scratches in the paint, so to speak. It\nhad, however, been a remarkably long time since his last jaunt through the\nmetaphysical. Only ninety short years<sup>2</sup> after he had turned his back\non the Garden of Eden for the last time, Aziraphale had rather unfortunately\nfound himself on the wrong end of an extremely unpleasant man with an extremely\nsharp dagger. Not yet knowing what would happen to him, he hadn&rsquo;t thought to counter\nthe attack, or even so much as move out of the way; after all, this was no\nweapon of divine or infernal design.</p><p>So he had been in for a rather nasty shock when he found\nhimself face-to-face with Heaven&rsquo;s quartermaster and the prospect of filling\nout innumerable forms<sup>3 </sup>and joining a thankfully short waiting list\nbefore he could be assigned a new body.</p><p>It had been enough to put him off the whole experience, and\nas such, he had endeavoured to avoid it at all costs in subsequent years. </p><p>He had done a commendable job of it, all told. There had\nbeen a couple of instances that had required a little last-minute intervention\nof demonic origin, but he tried not to dwell on those too much. Not, to be\nclear, because he felt it was a sign of personal failure, but rather because\nthe memory tended to give him the ethereal equivalent of heart palpitations.</p><p>This instance had been somewhat different &ndash; for a start, the\nonly violence had been in the form of a remarkably irate witchfinder bellowing\nnonsense and waving his finger around. For another, though Aziraphale had found\nhimself unexpectedly flung from his physical form, there had been no real harm\ndone to it<sup>4</sup> which made for a nice change. That had been several\nhours and four continents ago. Now, Aziraphale was starting to feel really\nquite exhausted.</p><p>It ought not to have been possible, he thought glumly to\nhimself. After all, exhaustion was, by definition, something that happened on\nthe material plane. Cells didn&rsquo;t have enough energy or something &ndash; he&rsquo;d never\nbothered himself with the particulars, as he&rsquo;d never considered any scenario\nthat it might apply to him. Really it should have been impossible for angels to\nget tired. They were fonts of divine energy, beings that existed on an utterly\nseparate level from the concept of exhaustion.</p><p>And yet, here he was, wherever that may be now. Exhausted.\nIncorporeal. No idea how much time had passed since he&rsquo;d stepped into the\ncircle, and therefore no idea just how long the world had left before it all\nwent a bit explodey.</p><p>As a matter of fact, though he didn&rsquo;t know it at that\nprecise moment, the world had been due some explosions approximately twelve\nminutes earlier, right around the time he had decided to do the metaphysical\nequivalent of tucking up his feet on the sofa and dozing in front of\nSpringwatch with a cup of tea tilting precariously in his hand. He had hoped\nthat this would go some way to restoring him to the point that he could\ncontinue looking for a suitable body to inhabit that was both receptive and at\nleast in the same country as the antichrist.</p><p>So far it didn&rsquo;t appear to be making much of a difference,\nbut Aziraphale was persevering nonetheless.</p><p>He was persevering so hard, in fact, that it took him what\nmay have been a small eternity &ndash; but was probably closer to a few seconds &ndash; to\nnotice that he was no longer alone in the space between dimensions.</p><p>Being that the other entity also lacked a body, and didn&rsquo;t\nappear to be an angel, demon, or Crowley, Aziraphale was rather thrown by this.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Um. Hello,&rdquo; he said<sup>5</sup> finally. He didn&rsquo;t really\nknow what else to do.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said the being, in what might have been a curious\nvoice if he had a voice, and Aziraphale had ears capable of discerning a\ncurious tone. &ldquo;What are you doing stuck all the way out here then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Ah</i>,&rdquo; said Aziraphale, in a pale imitation of his\nusual bluster. He found himself wishing rather desperately that he had hands\nwith which to fuss shirt cuffs, and a throat to clear. &ldquo;Well you see, that&rsquo;s a\nrather long story, and I&rsquo;m afraid we may be on something of a tight schedule &ndash;\nat least, I think we are, it&rsquo;s rather hard to tell, but I would hope that even\nlike this I might have noticed if things had, er, got under way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;ve got time,&rdquo; said the being. &ldquo;But I think\nI probably know most of it already, and it&rsquo;s just boring if you hafta hear the\nsame story twice so close together. Are you Aziraphale then? &lsquo;Cause if you&rsquo;re\nnot then I really think you should just tell me now. I&rsquo;ve already got a lotta\nwork to do, and I really do need to find this Aziraphale person. Angel.\nAngel-person &ndash; sorry, that&rsquo;s not rude, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I &ndash; well, no, I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; Aziraphale said. He\ncontemplated lying to the being for just a moment, but some deeply-held\ninstinct told him just what a bad idea that would be. &ldquo;And yes, I am\nAziraphale.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, good,&rdquo; this time, Aziraphale was swamped with an\nimpression of relief. &ldquo;It really would&rsquo;a been a pain if I&rsquo;d &lsquo;ad to go &lsquo;round\nlooking for you everywhere and when.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Aziraphale said blankly. He tried to take a moment to\nrally himself, and failed miserably. &ldquo;To, to whom am I speaking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;m Adam Young,&rdquo; said the voice, apparently oblivious to the\ntailspin this sent Aziraphale&rsquo;s poor, racing mind into. &ldquo;And I think you&rsquo;re\nlast on my list of things to get sorted out. First I thought I could just put\nyou back the way you was and that&rsquo;d be jus&rsquo; fine, but then I reckon&rsquo;d I should\nprobably come get you sorted m&rsquo;self. &lsquo;s tricky trying to get someone back in a\nbody that dun&rsquo;t exist when they&rsquo;re not even in the right place for bodies to\nbe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Aziraphale said faintly; he was suddenly, acutely\naware of the fact that he was speaking currently to the antichrist, a being\nthat could theoretically wipe him from this and every other plane of existence<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; <i>then</i> I thought it&rsquo;d be rude if I just went and\nstuck you back in the same body as you had, an&rsquo; din&rsquo;t even ask if that body was\nokay for you,&rdquo; Adam continued, and he somehow managed to give the impression of\na wide-eyed, if not entirely earnest, stare. This was impressive given that he\nhad no body, no eyes to widen, and no actual voice to give any sort of\ninflection. Aziraphale would no doubt spend a great deal of time later being\nappropriately impressed, when he was no longer trying to metaphysically\nhyperventilate.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes I was rather fond of it,&rdquo; Aziraphale managed. In\nthat precise moment, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tell you if that was the\ntruth or not<sup>7</sup>. He only knew that he really didn&rsquo;t want to be putting\nin any special requests for a new body to the antichrist, who had, as far as he\nwas able to tell, not made the world go all explodey.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Adam in something like relief. &ldquo;Tha&rsquo;s good. Easy,\nI mean. I&rsquo;ll hafta drop you off where you were, though. Jus&rsquo; gimme a sec, I&rsquo;ll\nget you all fixed up proper.&rdquo;</p><p>And it was so.</p><p>Aziraphale opened his eyes and took a deep, unnecessary\nbreath. He patted his hands over his coat, and tried to twist himself around to\nsee that everything was present and correct. He thought that perhaps his coat\nwas a little longer, his sweater a little more fitted, but it was really quite\nhard to tell in a body that was still relearning what synapses were.</p><p>He turned slowly, but there was no sign of Adam &ndash; not even a\nlingering hint of ozone to suggest he had ever been there. He then continued\nturning, struck by the sudden realisation that he had no idea where on God&rsquo;s\ngreen Earth he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, followed swiftly by a word that may have been\ninappropriate in polite company &ndash; but, if there is no polite company to hear an\ninappropriate word fall in a forest, who&rsquo;s to say if it made a sound?<sup>8</sup></p><p>&nbsp;*****</p><p>1 &ndash; In that particular instance, it had been rather more\ntear than wear</p><p>2 &ndash; Give or take. Functioning calendars had only existed for\nsixty of those years</p><p>3 &ndash; Literally &ndash; humans hadn&rsquo;t invented numbers that could\ncount that high yet</p><p>4 &ndash; Aside from the unfortunate dissembling down to the\nmolecular level</p><p>5 &ndash; He did not speak as you or I might speak, as he lacked\nthe mouth necessary to do so. He did not even speak as you or I might imagine a\nformless denizen of Heaven would speak. To properly explain how he spoke would\nrequire a number of PhDs that don&rsquo;t exist on Earth and an in-depth understanding\nof the wavelengths that angels generally occupy outside the range of human\nperception, of which this author has neither</p><p>6 &ndash; He was also rapidly coming to terms with the fact that he\nhad listed &lsquo;child murder&rsquo; as one of the possible solutions to the problems the\nday had presented. Very low down the list, mind you, but still certainly\npresent</p><p>7 &ndash; It was</p><p>8 &ndash; It did</p><p>&nbsp;*****</p><p>The world had been restored for thirteen hours, and a lone\ndemon had been drinking solidly for twelve of them. The first hour had been\ndedicated to transporting himself back to London, or it would have been a solid\nthirteen.</p><p>Crowley couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he had been this\ndrunk. It might have been in what would later become Croatia, in 1132 BC. It\nmay have been just after the Library of Alexandria &ndash; ahem &ndash; was destroyed. It\nmight have been sometime in the First World War<sup>1</sup>. </p><p>Certainly, he thought, staring at the empty bottle in his\nhand with something a little like betrayal, he had never been this drunk on his\nown.</p><p>And really, that was the crux of the problem, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>He let his head fall back against the plush pile of the rug\nbeneath him. It didn&rsquo;t make quite the satisfying <i>thunk</i> he&rsquo;d been hoping\nfor &ndash; more of a dull <i>whoomf</i>, really &ndash; so he waved unsteady fingers\nthrough the air to miracle up the delayed sound himself. That, he thought, was\nmuch better suited to his current mood.</p><p>The bottle in his other hand had once contained a rather\nfine 1947 Cheval Blanc that he hadn&rsquo;t tasted a single mouthful of, and now\ncontained little more than dregs. He hadn&rsquo;t bothered to get himself more\nbottles &ndash; only continued refilling this one every time it got too light. He&rsquo;d\njust tried to do so again, and managed nothing more than a faint headache, so\nfor the moment he&rsquo;d abandoned the attempt.</p><p>Crowley blinked blearily up at the ceiling, and lamented his\ninability to fall into a drunken coma. </p><p>Oh, he could sleep well enough &ndash; Crowley was a <i>champion</i>\nsleeper. He was also quite proficient in naps, snoozes, dozes, and the sort of\nlazy Sunday afternoon in which you are sure that you <i>were</i> awake, yet\nsomehow cannot produce a single piece of evidence to prove it. All of that was,\nunfortunately, very different from a drunken coma. They all involved being able\nto keep his blessed mind quiet for longer than two consecutive minutes.</p><p>Aziraphale had been keeping this bottle back &ndash; not for any\nsort of special occasion, but just because it hadn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d said, felt like the\nright time to drink it. Aziraphale was very big on listening to those odd\nlittle feelings of his. It had been exactly where it had been kept since\nAziraphale first bought it in 1948, still perfectly preserved, and Crowley&rsquo;s\nhand shook a little when he had picked it up. </p><p>There had been a part of him &ndash; small, but far too loud to\ncompletely ignore &ndash; that had hoped to hear the angel&rsquo;s huff behind him. To have\nthe bottle snatched away because it <i>still isn&rsquo;t time for this one, my dear,\nreally</i>. </p><p>Of course, it had been only him, the bottle, and the books.\nHe&rsquo;d almost tried spilling a little wine over the first-edition Dante, but\nhadn&rsquo;t been able to bring himself to, in the end. As satisfying as it might\nhave been, it still seemed like a step too far. Besides, he thought to himself.\nBesides. It had been bad enough being allowed to drink the wine. He didn&rsquo;t know\nwhat he&rsquo;d do if there was no-one to stop him ruining the books<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s wandering mind found itself pondering if Adam had\nrecreated the holy sigil that Aziraphale had hidden beneath this very rug. He\ncould find out, he supposed, then groaned as even the thought of standing made\nhis head swim. It was harmless to him inactive, but he still didn&rsquo;t like the\nthought of sitting atop a direct line to the big guys Upstairs.</p><p>Even if he did have a few choice words for them.</p><p>But then again, there was always the chance it wasn&rsquo;t Heaven\nat all. The Metatron <i>had</i> looked terribly confused<sup>3</sup> when he&rsquo;d\ncornered them about Aziraphale on the airfield. Maybe they really hadn&rsquo;t had\nanything to do with it. Maybe they really didn&rsquo;t know what had happened.</p><p>Which only left Downstairs, something that Crowley felt only\nmarginally more equipped to deal with. Beyond that, there really wasn&rsquo;t a\nterribly long list of suspects.</p><p>Only the divine or the infernal were capable of true\nsmiting. And if Adam hadn&rsquo;t brought Aziraphale back, then that meant there was\nnothing left of him <i>to</i> bring back. It was a fairly simple progression of\nlogic that managed to completely stall Crowley about halfway through. <i>Six\nthousand years </i>he thought bitterly. <i>Just enough time to get used to\nhaving someone around</i>.</p><p>He lifted to bottle to his lips again, grimacing as he\nremembered his last attempt to refill it. Well, there was no rush. He had time.\nIt wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world.</p><p>Pity, that.</p><p>Well, no. That wasn&rsquo;t fair. After all, this world had always\nbeen more or less decent to them &ndash; <i>him</i>. And he <i>had</i> just spent the\nlast eleven years trying to make sure it could continue being decent. It would\nhave been a terrible shame if, after all that effort, it had just gone and\nended anyway.</p><p>It was just that. That. That Crowley had always trusted in\nthe universe to look out for him, one way or another. And he&rsquo;d never quite\nrealised that, in all of his optimism, he&rsquo;d somehow included Aziraphale in that\nassumption. That if there was something out there in the universe watching his\nback &ndash; be it God, Satan, someone else, or just the natural forces of cosmic\nentropy &ndash; then it only made sense that it would be watching out for the angel\nas well.</p><p>Crowley had been wrong about a lot of things &ndash; one of the\nperils of having been around since the Beginning. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever been as wrong about anything as he\nwas about this.</p><p>&ldquo;Bugger thissss,&rdquo; he said, trying to sit himself back up for\njust a moment, before abandoning the attempt when all it did was offer him a\nbetter view of the empty room, a mug of congealed cocoa still sat on the desk,\nand the tartan throw on the back of the sofa that Crowley had foolishly miracled\nup as a joke and Aziraphale had loved without the slightest hint of shame or\nirony.</p><p>&ldquo;Sssshould the burn the placccce back down! &lsquo;d sssserve you\nright, Zira! Leaving me to deal with the apocap &ndash; apolac &ndash; Armageddon all by\nmysssself! Going and getting yoursssself all, all <i>ssssmoted</i>!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley waved his hand towards the general vicinity of the\nrest of the shop in a gesture that he thought was appropriately menacing.</p><p>&ldquo;I will! I&rsquo;ll sssset fire to every one of your biblessss!\nYou&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;ll have to <i>thwart</i> me!&rdquo;</p><p>And nothing happened. The books didn&rsquo;t catch fire. Crowley\ndid not feel thwarted, so it was probably just that he was in no fit state to\nbe setting fire to anything. He was too busy, he realised in a distant sort of\nway, making an awful keening wail as he scrunched his eyes shut as tight as he\ncould.</p><p>It was probably a good thing he&rsquo;d been in some sort of shock\non the drive back. If he&rsquo;d felt anything like this, he likely would have hit\nmultiple other road users, and then Aziraphale, from wherever he was or wasn&rsquo;t,\nwould have been exceptionally disappointed. Well, there was every chance Aziraphale\nwas exceptionally disappointed with Crowley right now, but he couldn&rsquo;t find it\nin himself to care. If the angel wanted to judge him, he could come right on\nback to life and do it to Crowley&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He moaned, from somewhere low in his throat. &ldquo;What\ndid he ever do? He wasn&rsquo;t the one who, who invented original sin. He wasn&rsquo;t the\none who mucked up the Plan. What did he do to desssserve <i>thissss</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Unless &ndash; unless that was the point. Punishment wasn&rsquo;t really\npunishment is you didn&rsquo;t exist to suffer through it. Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t about\nAziraphale. </p><p>After all, Crowley was the only one suffering now.</p><p>Both Heaven and Hell, while unimaginative, were both <i>very</i>\nkeen on the ironic sorts of punishments. And while Crowley would have liked to\nthink that a benevolent God wouldn&rsquo;t approve of this sort of thing, he knew\nenough about the Creator &ndash; and all the things that had been going on since free\nwill really took off &ndash; to know that God wouldn&rsquo;t really care. At least, not\nenough to interfere.</p><p><i>Ineffable</i>, as the bloody angel would have said.\nExcept he wasn&rsquo;t here to say it now, and Crowley certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to\nstoop so low.</p><p>Begging on the other hand, was a low he had stooped to\nbefore, and would no doubt stoop to again.</p><p>&ldquo;Jusssst,&rdquo; he started, and tried to get the hissing under\ncontrol. It probably wasn&rsquo;t a very polite way to address the Almighty,\nespecially not for one of the fallen. &ldquo;Jussst, please, ssend him back. He should\nget to ssee that hiss books are all okay, and that the world isss ssstill sssspinning.\nHe&rsquo;ssss done enough good for that. Thwarted enough wilessss. And all the onessss\nhe didn&rsquo;t were my fault, really. Ssssso bring him &ndash; jussst bring him <i>back</i>.\nI know we haven&rsquo;t spoke in a really long time, and I know we aren&rsquo;t on good\ntermsss, but pleassse. For, for <i>Zira&rsquo;s </i>ssssake, pleassse, he&rsquo;sss all I&rsquo;ve\ngot left, he&rsquo;sss the only good thing I still have from Heaven, pleassse-&rdquo;</p><p>His voice cracked and gave up, but Crowley didn&rsquo;t notice. He\nkept up his pleas silently, mouth working awkwardly around a tongue just a\nlittle too long and forked to pass for human. His ears were ringing unpleasantly\n&ndash; either a product of the wine, or the fact that praying was always more than a\nlittle bit painful for demons.</p><p>But the ringing in his ears just grew louder for a brief, horrible\ninstant, before cutting out entirely.</p><p>Had Crowley been even slightly less of a drunken, mumbling\nmess, he may well have realised that the ringing was actually the doorbell of\nthe shop. He may have heard the click as the door was unlocked, or the\nshuffling of fine leather shoes over the mat. He may not have, of course, but\nwe will never know for certain. The reality was, he <i>was</i> that drunk, and\nhe <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> hear any of those things. The very next thing he heard, in\nfact, was an aggrieved sigh, and a rather put upon <i>tsk</i>. Crowley didn&rsquo;t\nhave the willpower at that precise moment to lift an eyelid; but then, he\ndidn&rsquo;t have to. He was very well acquainted with that put upon <i>tsk</i>. His\nmouth stretched into something that may have resembled a smile if it hadn&rsquo;t\nwobbled quite so much.</p><p>&ldquo;Ssssstill wassssn&rsquo;t time for it then? Angel?&rdquo; He asked,\nwaving the bottle haphazardly around. A couple of drops splashed on his face,\nand more than a couple onto his shirt. He gestured to miracle them away, but\ndidn&rsquo;t bother to look and see if it had worked.</p><p>&ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;ve never seen you in such a state,&rdquo; said a\nfamiliar voice to his left. Crowley&rsquo;s grasp on the bottle slackened, and he\nfelt it fall from between his fingers. It must have landed on the thick, soft\nrug somewhere beside him, because he didn&rsquo;t hear it hit the floor.</p><p>Crowley loved that rug. He could write sonnets devoted to\nthat rug. That rug and him had been through something real over the last twelve\nhours.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this, Crowley,&rdquo; said the voice that Crowley knew\nbetter than any sound in the world, a little nonsensically.</p><p><a>It wasn&rsquo;t Aziraphale. Crowley knew\nthat &ndash; had several very good arguments for it, in fact<sup>4</sup>.</a></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t open his\neyes to check.</p><p>There was a\nsensation like fingers &ndash; soft, warm, and a little bit heavenly &ndash; running over\nhis hair. Crowley tilted his face up towards it. He may not look so much like a\nserpent these days, but he&rsquo;d never quite managed to shake the habit of seeking\nout warmth. If Crowley really concentrated, he could almost muster up the\nfamiliar scent of bergamot and dust that always seemed to cling to Aziraphale&rsquo;s\novercoat.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear boy,\nwhat happened?&rdquo; Asked Hallucination Aziraphale. &ldquo;I was only gone a day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yesssss</i>!&rdquo;\nCrowley hissed despite himself. &ldquo;A whole &ndash; a whole blesssssed day! The firsssst\nday of, of, of the resssst of my life!&rdquo; </p><p>He hiccupped. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t a sob.\nCrowley didn&rsquo;t sob.</p><p>He did, however, drunkenly\nhiccup several times in a row, hard enough to make his chest ache and his eyes\nwater. He swiped furiously at his face and tried to curl himself into as small\na ball as possible &ndash; had he been sober enough, he might have even shrunk\nhimself down into a little snake to curl up even smaller and tighter. Snakes\ndidn&rsquo;t have treacherous tear ducts. Snakes didn&rsquo;t drunkenly imagine their dead\npartner gently lifting their head into a soft lap. Clearly, snakes were the\nsuperior beings, and it had only taken him six thousand years, one heartbreak,\nand one stage of grief to notice.</p><p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; the\nvoice was somehow both kind and exasperated, a combination that Aziraphale had\nmastered several millennia ago, and that Crowley had clearly thought worth committing\nto memory. &ldquo;Whatever is the matter? The world is safe, my books are all here,\nand don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t see your car outside. Anything else can be dealt with,\nhm?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley shook his\nhead wordlessly, but didn&rsquo;t trust himself to open his mouth. He&rsquo;d only end up\nhiccupping again.</p><p>&ldquo;Crowley? Can you\nsober up, dear?&rdquo; Crowley shook his head again, but this time managed a sullen\nlittle,</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to be sssssober.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dare I ask why not?&rdquo; Crowley had long known he was the only\ndemon with something even approaching an imagination, but even he hadn&rsquo;t\nrealised just how good it was. He was quite certain he&rsquo;d managed to get\nAziraphale&rsquo;s stuffy, put-upon eye-rolling spot on.</p><p>It seemed perfectly obvious to Crowley why he should never\nlike to be sober again, and as a hallucination of his, it should be perfectly\nclear to Aziraphale too. He opened one suspicious eye just a crack; just enough\nto see a vague outline that may have been angel-shaped with none of the defining\ncharacteristics. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go away if I&rsquo;m ssssober,&rdquo; he said wretchedly. The\nlap under his head jolted slightly, which was really rather rude for a\nhallucinatory pillow, in Crowley&rsquo;s opinion.</p><p>&ldquo;I most certainly will not!&rdquo; Ah, yes, the bluster. Crowley always\ndid like tempting that out. &ldquo;For a start, we&rsquo;re in <i>my</i> shop! And if you\nwill insist on staying drunk, I should at least like to know why on <i>Earth</i>\nyou thought it was a good idea to pass out on my nice rug!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Din&rsquo;t pass out,&rdquo; Crowley muttered sullenly, and didn&rsquo;t\npoint out that it wasn&rsquo;t for a lack of trying. His brain and any products\nthereof would already know that, so it would be rather pointless. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Crowley</i>,&rdquo; said the angel warningly. </p><p>Crowley found himself overtaken by another sudden bought of\nhiccups.</p><p>&ldquo;They killed my best friend,&rdquo; he said, and didn&rsquo;t hiss at\nall. The hand that had been moving gently through his hair all this time, almost\nunnoticed, stopped for a second and shook, before starting again.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. I &ndash; well. I&rsquo;m terribly sorry to hear that, dearest,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said, and there was no hint of temper in his voice. Just something a\nlittle shaky that Crowley couldn&rsquo;t quite put his finger on.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; there was hesitance now, where there hadn&rsquo;t been\nbefore. Crowley tried to reach up, in the vague direction he thought the angel&rsquo;s\nface might be, to pat at it reassuringly. Aziraphale was de &ndash; gone. He had\nnothing to be hesitant about, and Crowley tried to tell him that with a few\nclumsy swipes of his hand against what may have been a cheek. It felt like\nAziraphale was smiling, but his voice was still sad when he spoke. &ldquo;Have you tried\nasking Adam about it? He&rsquo;s really a terribly nice boy, under all of the Hellish\npowers.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley managed a despondent shake of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Silly angel,&rdquo; he said, and it was fond now. He had decided,\nrather abruptly, that he could be as fond as he wanted. As fond as he had been\nfor six thousand year, under it all. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t bring back something that dun&rsquo;t\neven exisssst anymore. He already fixed everythin&rsquo; elsssse.&rdquo; He leaned up a\nlittle, and whispered, like it was some great secret,</p><p>&ldquo;I even assssked <i>Death</i>.&rdquo; He spoke over Aziraphale&rsquo;s squawk\nof <i>you what?</i> &ldquo;And y&rsquo;know what he ssssaid? That it wassssn&rsquo;t hissss\njurissssdiction anymore!&rdquo;</p><p>It had seemed something of a win-win at the time. Either\nDeath could do something about it, or he would be annoyed enough by Crowley&rsquo;s\nasking to do something else &ndash; at that point, Crowley hadn&rsquo;t been too picky. But\nit seemed his luck had run out &ndash; his optimistic streak had carried him as far as\nit was able, and not an inch further.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you tell me about them?&rdquo; Aziraphale asked after a\nlong moment of silence. His voice small, and tight, and something about it\nstruck Crowley as wrong, but his brain was far too slippery to grasp what it was.\n&ldquo;They must have been something truly special, to go to all that trouble. It\nmight &ndash; help. Help you, I mean.&rdquo; Crowley thought this through hazily, before\nnodding. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if it really made sense or not, but he was willing to\ntrust that Aziraphale would know more about this sort of thing than him.</p><p>&ldquo;Known &lsquo;m since &ndash; sssince &ndash; forever. Before time was a\nthing,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;Could alwaysss count on him. And we din&rsquo;t have a lot in\ncommon, but we had all the important bitsss! And bessssides, you get used to people\nbeing around that long.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale laughed, a little uncomfortably.</p><p>&ldquo;Well now, you don&rsquo;t need to tell <i>me</i> that, my dear,&rdquo;\nhe said.</p><p>&ldquo;But I do!&rdquo; This, suddenly, seemed extremely important.\nCrowley pushed himself into a popstion that could be described as upright, if\none were feeling particularly generous<sup>5</sup>, and peered unsteadily into\nthe hallucination&rsquo;s eyes for the first time. They looked exactly like\nAziraphale&rsquo;s, complete with the little golden flecks that always caught the\nlight no matter which way he turned. <i>Bless it</i> but Crowley was good.</p><p>&ldquo;I never told you when you were alive, and now you&rsquo;ve gone\nand got yourself smited, so I&rsquo;ll never get to tell you again!&rdquo;</p><p>He had the singular pleasure of watching Aziraphale&rsquo;s eyes\nwiden, and a flood of colour rush up his cheeks, but didn&rsquo;t pause to appreciate\nthe sight, steamrolling over any of Aziraphale&rsquo;s attempts to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;You were -! You were -! Huffy, and you had terrible taste\nin clothes, and I don&rsquo;t underssssstand what&rsquo;ssss so great about Classic FM that\nyou thought it had to be the only blessed channel you can get all over the\ncountry no matter how bad the ssssignal is, and sssometimes I hiss my words\njust because I know it makessss you smile, and I&rsquo;ve never unkilled a duck for\nanyone else, and none of it <i>mattersss</i> because Heaven or Hell or\nssssomeone decided to off you, and now I&rsquo;m sssstuck here on my own waiting for\nthe next go-around!&rdquo;</p><p>It was quiet for a long time. Long enough for Crowley to\nslump back into the hallucination&rsquo;s lap and close his eyes again. They really\nwere so heavy, and sore after the hiccups made them water so much.</p><p>&ldquo;I really do think,&rdquo; Aziraphale said finally, &ldquo;that you\nought to sober up.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley didn&rsquo;t dignify that with a response beyond\ntightening his grip on the angel&rsquo;s calf.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be in both our best interests?&rdquo;</p><p>Still not worth a reply.</p><p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo;</p><p>That made him pause a little, before shaking his head\ndefinitively no.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of &ndash; <i>someone</i>.&rdquo; The next thing\nCrowley knew, he was up on his feet, through no effort or will of his own.\nThere were a pair of arms wrapped rather solidly around his shoulders, and his\nfeet didn&rsquo;t want to move separately, apparently rather stuck on the idea that\nthey used to be a tail. His face was pressed heavily against a soft shoulder\nthough, so Crowley didn&rsquo;t complain, even when the wool tickled at his nose. He\nhad the vague feeling that he was being led somewhere, but he&rsquo;d be redeemed if\nhe could figure out where.</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Aziraphale muttered, right before he dropped\nCrowley onto what felt like a bed &ndash; just the right side of springy, with a\nthread count that was honestly sinful. Crowley appreciated it for an\nall-too-brief second before he found himself gripped by panic.</p><p>He surged up, and halfway off the bed before Aziraphale\ncaught him again.</p><p>&ldquo;Nuh &ndash; no!&rdquo; If Crowley lay down in a bed, then he would go\nto sleep. If Crowley went to sleep, then he would wake up sober. If he woke up\nsober, then Aziraphale would be gone. &ldquo;Nonono.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; Aziraphale&rsquo;s voice was firm, though his hands\nwere soft as anything where they were untangling Crowley&rsquo;s from his lapels. &ldquo;You\nneed a good night&rsquo;s sleep my dear, and to face the morning with a clear head. I\npromise you it&rsquo;ll all seem much brighter.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley shook his head where it was mashed against the side\nof Aziraphale&rsquo;s neck. The neck in question moved a little as Aziraphale sighed.</p><p>&ldquo;Would it help if I stayed with you?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>That&hellip; gave Crowley pause. He hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. If the\nhallucination stayed with him while he slept, and Crowley held on tightly\nenough &ndash; well, he was pretty solid now. As long as Crowley didn&rsquo;t move a single\nmuscle as he slept<sup>6</sup> then it should be fine.</p><p>There was something amiss with that logic, but exhaustion\nhad crept up on him like a snake in the grass, and Crowley found himself being\nlowered back to the bed once more, this time unresistingly.</p><p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; was the last thing Crowley heard as he\nslipped off to sleep. He had just enough time to congratulate himself on\nmiracling up such a comfortable bed &ndash; he&rsquo;d even managed to permeate the pillows\nwith Aziraphale&rsquo;s scent, which he desperately pressed his nose into now &ndash;\nbefore he was swept away<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;*****</p><p>1 &ndash; In fact it was none of these, for the simple reason that\nCrowley had never been this drunk before in his very long existence</p><p>2 &ndash; Well, no, that&rsquo;s not entirely accurate. He did know what\nhe would do. He was just trying very hard not to think on it too long, when he\nknew that Aziraphale would disapprove most vehemently</p><p>3 &ndash; Insofar as a being with no face made of holy fire can\nlook confused</p><p>4 &ndash; The arguments went as follows:</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale had been smited. Smote? Smiten? </p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale would never approve of Crowley&rsquo;s deep\nlove for this rug</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale had never, in six thousand years,\nsounded quite so fondly exasperated, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have started now</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale was dead</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale hadn&rsquo;t started nagging him about the\nwine</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale hadn&rsquo;t mentioned the new books that\nCrowley had noticed Adam stocked</p><p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAziraphale wasn&rsquo;t coming back</p><p>5 &ndash; As well as a little hazy on the meaning of the word &lsquo;upright&rsquo;</p><p>6 &ndash; Which was, fortunately, how he naturally slept anyway</p><p>7 &ndash; Had he stayed awake any longer, he would have realised\nthat not even he would have miracle up such a hideous quilt cover. He also\nwould have felt the careful, cleansing touch of a kiss against his forehead to\nkeep away bad dreams &ndash; though demons have no other kind. But he did not stay\nawake, and so he noticed nothing.</p>",
