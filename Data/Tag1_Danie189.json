His eyes flickered to the screen noticing there were still fifteen unopened emails I&rsquo;m his mailbox.</p><p>Eyes starting to twitch and hurt Phil took his glasses off and rubbed into his eyes perhaps a little harder then he should have as it seemed to intensify the headache he had already had.</p><p>A soft knock on the door got his attention.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan questioned softly sticking his head in the door.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat is it baby?</b></i>&ldquo; Phil asked turning back to his emails.</p><p><i><b>&quot;Frozen over.\u201d</b></i> He whispered softly.</p><p>Phil glanced down at the clock on the computer. He couldn&rsquo;t believe over two hours had passed already. He sighed,<b><i> \u201cAlright kitten a promise is a promise go get your shoes on and we&rsquo;ll walk to the park ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yay! Thwnk you Daddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan squealed.</p><p>~~~~~~<br/>The walk to the park only took a few minutes since they didn&rsquo;t live that far. Dan buzzed with anticipation the entire time.</p><p><i><b>\u201cI&rsquo;m going to swing dawdy!&ldquo; </b></i>He squealed swing Phil&rsquo;s arm back and forth.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s nice baby,\u201d</b></i> he smiled.</p><p>They came upon the park and Phil walked him up to the swings.<b><i> \u201cOk kitten daddy&rsquo;s going to go sit right over there, </i></b>&ldquo; he said pointing to the benches over on the other side of the swings.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; But daddy I want you to push me!&ldquo; </b></i>He whined.</p><p>Phil closed his eyes <b><i>&quot;Baby daddy isn&rsquo;t feeling too well, maybe in a little bit ok?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked knowing full well that Dan would probably tucker himself out before he remembered Phil had said that.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIs daddy sick?&ldquo; </b></i>Dan asked suddenly worried. <b><i>\u201c I don&rsquo;t want daddy to be sick!\u201d </i></b>Tears formed in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cNo daddy&rsquo;s not sick Darling just a headache ok?\u201d </b></i>He said trying to calm the boy down.</p><p>Dan looked at him skeptically before finally accepting his answer,<b><i> \u201cok daddy I&rsquo;ll by myself for now. You go sit.&rdquo; </i></b>Dan demanded pointing to the bench.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i> &ldquo;alright love I&rsquo;ll be right over there if you need anything. Have fun ok?\u201d</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Ok daddy!\u201d </b></i>The boy screamed already leaving Phil alone as he ran to get on the swings.</p><p>~~~<br/>Phil hadn&rsquo;t been sitting here long before a woman probably in her mid-thirties sat down beside him.</p><p><i><b>\u201cHello!&ldquo;</b></i> She bright exclaimed, <b><i>\u201cMy names Victoria.&rdquo;</i></b> She said extending her hand to Phil.</p><p>Phil really didn&rsquo;t feel like socializing but not wanting to be rude he extended his own hand, <i><b>\u201cPhil.&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Which launched the women into a full-fledged bragging session about her daughter.</p><p>Phil sighed not really wanting to listen but being too socially awkward to saying anything to her.</p><p>Eventually, the conversation took a turn when the women mentioned some new kids show that had come out that her daughter loved.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDan loves they show as well!</b></i>&rdquo; He said.</p><p><i><b>\u201c Oh is Dan your son?&ldquo;</b></i> She asked.<br/><b><i>&quot;Yeah,\u201d</i></b> Phil said not wanting to get into the logistics with this women.</p><p><b><i>\u201cIt&rsquo;s such a great show it taught Emily her ABCs in less than a month.</i></b>\u201d She gushed.</p><p>This lead them into an in-depth conversation about children&rsquo;s tv and the benefits it had.</p><p>~~~~<br/>Dan watched his daddy talk to the women and sighed he wished his daddy was with him but his daddy didn&rsquo;t feel good. Getting bored on the swings he got off and made his way over to the slide. He patiently waited behind a boy for his turn to go down the slide.</p><p>While waiting his turn he felt a tap on his shoulder, <b><i>\u201dExcuse me but what are you doing?\u201d </i></b>A young girl about a foot <br/>Shorter than him asked hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Gonna go down the slide.&rdquo;</b></i> He said shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>He turned back around because the line had moved. He was now second to next in line.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYou&rsquo;re too big to play!&ldquo;</b></i> The girl shouted. <br/>Startled tears started to form in his eyes. <i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean?&rdquo; </b></i>He asked lips quivering.</p><p>The girl stomped her foot,<i><b> \u201c Your an adult you&rsquo;re too big to go down.\u201d</b></i> She said once again.</p><p>Dan was confused what was she talking about he was little just like her. His brain was too small to comprehend that what she was actually saying was his long limbs would definitely be a little long to go down the short slide.</p><p>With tears still in his eyes, Dan turned his back to the girl hoping she would go away and leave him alone. But instead of leaving him alone the girl kept yelling at him and by this time Dan was close to full in sobbing. He turned around to yell at the girl to go away when out of know where he felt hands on him and the next thing he knew was he was on the ground in the dirt.</p><p>This caused a very distressed Dan to have a full blown Panic attack sobbing and covered in dirt.</p><p>Phil was in the middle of telling the women how Dan had once fallen asleep in the middle of the store when he heard Dan scream.</p><p>Shook from his conversation Phil stood up and Sprint over to where Dan sat still on the ground. Once he reached him he got down on one knee,<b><i> \u201cDanny what&rsquo;s wrong?&ldquo;</i></b> He asked frantically trying to figure out why his boyfriend was a sobbing mess sitting in the ground.</p><p>Dan threw into Phil&rsquo;s shirt clutching the material of his t-shirt in his hand. Sobs wrecked through his body shaking him with every breath.</p><p><i><b>\u201cShe&ndash;sh-she pushed me, daddy!\u201d</b></i> He wailed pointing to a small blonde child stood next to him looking slightly frightened.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Is this true? Did you push him?\u201d</b></i> Phil demand.</p><p>Dan clutched Phil&rsquo;s shirt tighter and buried his face into his neck as the girl spoke.</p><p><i><b>\u201cYeah, but I didn&rsquo;t know he be a big baby about it and cry.\u201d</b></i> She said the scared look on her face now gone.</p><p><i>\u201c<b>Why on Earth would you do such a thing?&rdquo; </b></i>He demanded.</p><p>Phil held on to the sobbing boy waiting for her to answer.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEmily, what is going on?&ldquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil looked up to see the Victoria the women he had been talking to run up.</p><p><i><b>\u201cIs this your daughter ?&rdquo; </b></i>He asked.</p><p>The women wrapped her arms around the girl,<b><i> \u201cYes this is Emily.&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&rdquo; Well, your daughter just pushed Dan down and doesn&rsquo;t seem to be sorry about it.\u201d </i></b>He snapped.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWait this is Dan?&ldquo; </b></i>She asked looking confused.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Daddy I wanna go home!\u201d </b></i>Dan sobbed.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s ok baby we&rsquo;ll go home soon.\u201d </i></b>He said rubbing circles into the crying boys back</p><p><b>&rdquo; Is this some kind of joke?</b>&ldquo; She asked still looking completely confused.</p><p>Phil was getting angrier by the minute. \u201c<b><i>Of course this isn&rsquo;t a joke! Don&rsquo;t you see him crying?&rdquo; </i></b>He asked pointing to the now whimpering boy.</p><p>The women and her daughter didn&rsquo;t say anything and just stared at them. Finally getting fed up Phil pulled Dan up with him and stood up <i><b>\u201c I think you owe him an apology.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No way I&rsquo;m not apologizing to him! What I said was true he is too big to be playing here. He\u2019s a freak!\u201d </i></b>Emily shouted at him tears now forming in her eyes.</p><p>Phil looked at Victoria and the women wouldn&rsquo;t meet his eyes.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, aren&rsquo;t you going to make her apologize?\u201d </i></b>He demanded.</p><p>Victoria looked at him hateful now.<b><i> \u201cI&rsquo;m not making my daughter apologize to that freak! </i></b>She screamed pointing at Dan.</p><p>This caused the bow hiccuping Dan to begin sobbing again.</p><p>Not even worried about an apology anymore Phil took Dan&rsquo;s hand and started walking away. He very much wanted to tell the women she and her daughter were being hateful and should be ashamed of themselves but his top priority at the moment was Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to soothe the clearly upset and crying boy Phil had wrapped himself around Dan again. Of course, making sure they were far away from the hateful mother and daughter.</p><p>Phil held the boy and let him cry and eventually his sobs subsided.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy?&rdquo;</b></i> A small voice questioned him.</p><p>Phil hummed, <i><b>\u201cWhat is it kitten?&ldquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&quot;Why was that girl so mean?</i></b>\u201d He whispered into Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>Phil sighed <i><b>\u201cI don&rsquo;t know baby.\u201d</b></i> He answered honestly. <b><i>&quot;some people are just hateful I guess.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Dan sighed and shoved his face closer I to Phil&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>Phil just sat there hugging the boy when an idea came to him.<b><i> \u201cHey, baby how about we go home and we can play princess?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan perked up, <i><b>\u201cReally daddy?\u201d</b></i> He asked suddenly getting excited.</p><p>Phil chuckled <i><b>\u201cof course I know it&rsquo;s your favorite game.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan squealed with excitement and shot up trying to pull Phil up with him.</p><p>Laughing again Phil stood up and took Dan&rsquo;s hand. Yes, he still had a headache but he today reminded him how important his baby was to him and all he wanted to do was make him happy.</p><p>So Dan and Phil made their way back to the apartment where Dan dressed Phil in a pink princess dress and covering his face messily in makeup with Phil enjoying every moment of it.</p>",

He very much wanted to tell the women she and her daughter were being hateful and should be ashamed of themselves but his top priority at the moment was Dan.</p><p>Trying his best to soothe the clearly upset and crying boy Phil had wrapped himself around Dan again. Of course, making sure they were far away from the hateful mother and daughter.</p><p>Phil held the boy and let him cry and eventually his sobs subsided.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</b></i> A small voice questioned him.</p><p>Phil hummed, <i><b>\u201cWhat is it kitten?\u201c</b></i></p><p><b><i>\"Why was that girl so mean?</i></b>\u201d He whispered into Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>Phil sighed <i><b>\u201cI don\u2019t know baby.\u201d</b></i> He answered honestly. <b><i>\"some people are just hateful I guess.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan sighed and shoved his face closer I to Phil\u2019s neck.</p><p>Phil just sat there hugging the boy when an idea came to him.<b><i> \u201cHey, baby how about we go home and we can play princess?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Dan perked up, <i><b>\u201cReally daddy?\u201d</b></i> He asked suddenly getting excited.</p><p>Phil chuckled <i><b>\u201cof course I know it\u2019s your favorite game.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Dan squealed with excitement and shot up trying to pull Phil up with him.</p><p>Laughing again Phil stood up and took Dan\u2019s hand. Yes, he still had a headache but he today reminded him how important his baby was to him and all he wanted to do was make him happy.</p><p>So Dan and Phil made their way back to the apartment where Dan dressed Phil in a pink princess dress and covering his face messily in makeup with Phil enjoying every moment of it.</p>",

His eyes flickered to the screen noticing there were still fifteen unopened emails I&rsquo;m his mailbox.</p><p>Eyes starting to twitch and hurt Phil took his glasses off and rubbed into his eyes perhaps a little harder then he should have as it seemed to intensify the headache he had already had.</p><p>A soft knock on the door got his attention.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;</b></i> Dan questioned softly sticking his head in the door.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What is it baby?</b></i>&ldquo; Phil asked turning back to his emails.</p><p><i><b>\"Frozen over.&rdquo;</b></i> He whispered softly.</p><p>Phil glanced down at the clock on the computer. He couldn&rsquo;t believe over two hours had passed already. He sighed,<b><i> &ldquo;Alright kitten a promise is a promise go get your shoes on and we&rsquo;ll walk to the park ok?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Yay! Thwnk you Daddy!&rdquo; </b></i>Dan squealed.</p><p>~~~~~~<br />The walk to the park only took a few minutes since they didn&rsquo;t live that far. Dan buzzed with anticipation the entire time.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to swing dawdy!&ldquo; </b></i>He squealed swing Phil&rsquo;s arm back and forth.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s nice baby,&rdquo;</b></i> he smiled.</p><p>They came upon the park and Phil walked him up to the swings.<b><i> &ldquo;Ok kitten daddy&rsquo;s going to go sit right over there, </i></b>&ldquo; he said pointing to the benches over on the other side of the swings.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; But daddy I want you to push me!&ldquo; </b></i>He whined.</p><p>Phil closed his eyes <b><i>\"Baby daddy isn&rsquo;t feeling too well, maybe in a little bit ok?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked knowing full well that Dan would probably tucker himself out before he remembered Phil had said that.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Is daddy sick?&ldquo; </b></i>Dan asked suddenly worried. <b><i>&ldquo; I don&rsquo;t want daddy to be sick!&rdquo; </i></b>Tears formed in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;No daddy&rsquo;s not sick Darling just a headache ok?&rdquo; </b></i>He said trying to calm the boy down.</p><p>Dan looked at him skeptically before finally accepting his answer,<b><i> &ldquo;ok daddy I&rsquo;ll by myself for now. You go sit.&rdquo; </i></b>Dan demanded pointing to the bench.</p><p>Phil chuckled<b><i> &ldquo;alright love I&rsquo;ll be right over there if you need anything. Have fun ok?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Ok daddy!&rdquo; </b></i>The boy screamed already leaving Phil alone as he ran to get on the swings.</p><p>~~~<br />Phil hadn&rsquo;t been sitting here long before a woman probably in her mid-thirties sat down beside him.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Hello!&ldquo;</b></i> She bright exclaimed, <b><i>&ldquo;My names Victoria.&rdquo;</i></b> She said extending her hand to Phil.</p><p>Phil really didn&rsquo;t feel like socializing but not wanting to be rude he extended his own hand, <i><b>&ldquo;Phil.&ldquo;</b></i></p><p>Which launched the women into a full-fledged bragging session about her daughter.</p><p>Phil sighed not really wanting to listen but being too socially awkward to saying anything to her.</p><p>Eventually, the conversation took a turn when the women mentioned some new kids show that had come out that her daughter loved.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Dan loves they show as well!</b></i>&rdquo; He said.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo; Oh is Dan your son?&ldquo;</b></i> She asked.<br /><b><i>\"Yeah,&rdquo;</i></b> Phil said not wanting to get into the logistics with this women.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a great show it taught Emily her ABCs in less than a month.</i></b>&rdquo; She gushed.</p><p>This lead them into an in-depth conversation about children&rsquo;s tv and the benefits it had.</p><p>~~~~<br />Dan watched his daddy talk to the women and sighed he wished his daddy was with him but his daddy didn&rsquo;t feel good. Getting bored on the swings he got off and made his way over to the slide. He patiently waited behind a boy for his turn to go down the slide.</p><p>While waiting his turn he felt a tap on his shoulder, <b><i>&rdquo;Excuse me but what are you doing?&rdquo; </i></b>A young girl about a foot <br />Shorter than him asked hands on her hips.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Gonna go down the slide.&rdquo;</b></i> He said shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>He turned back around because the line had moved. He was now second to next in line.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too big to play!&ldquo;</b></i> The girl shouted. <br />Startled tears started to form in his eyes. <i><b>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </b></i>He asked lips quivering.</p><p>The girl stomped her foot,<i><b> &ldquo; Your an adult you&rsquo;re too big to go down.&rdquo;</b></i> She said once again.</p><p>Dan was confused what was she talking about he was little just like her. His brain was too small to comprehend that what she was actually saying was his long limbs would definitely be a little long to go down the short slide.</p><p>With tears still in his eyes, Dan turned his back to the girl hoping she would go away and leave him alone. But instead of leaving him alone the girl kept yelling at him and by this time Dan was close to full in sobbing. He turned around to yell at the girl to go away when out of know where he felt hands on him and the next thing he knew was he was on the ground in the dirt.</p><p>This caused a very distressed Dan to have a full blown Panic attack sobbing and covered in dirt.</p><p>Phil was in the middle of telling the women how Dan had once fallen asleep in the middle of the store when he heard Dan scream.</p><p>Shook from his conversation Phil stood up and Sprint over to where Dan sat still on the ground. Once he reached him he got down on one knee,<b><i> &ldquo;Danny what&rsquo;s wrong?&ldquo;</i></b> He asked frantically trying to figure out why his boyfriend was a sobbing mess sitting in the ground.</p><p>Dan threw into Phil&rsquo;s shirt clutching the material of his t-shirt in his hand. Sobs wrecked through his body shaking him with every breath.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;She&ndash;sh-she pushed me, daddy!&rdquo;</b></i> He wailed pointing to a small blonde child stood next to him looking slightly frightened.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Is this true? Did you push him?&rdquo;</b></i> Phil demand.</p><p>Dan clutched Phil&rsquo;s shirt tighter and buried his face into his neck as the girl spoke.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Yeah, but I didn&rsquo;t know he be a big baby about it and cry.&rdquo;</b></i> She said the scared look on her face now gone.</p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Why on Earth would you do such a thing?&rdquo; </b></i>He demanded.</p><p>Phil held on to the sobbing boy waiting for her to answer.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Emily, what is going on?&ldquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil looked up to see the Victoria the women he had been talking to run up.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Is this your daughter ?&rdquo; </b></i>He asked.</p><p>The women wrapped her arms around the girl,<b><i> &ldquo;Yes this is Emily.&ldquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&rdquo; Well, your daughter just pushed Dan down and doesn&rsquo;t seem to be sorry about it.&rdquo; </i></b>He snapped.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Wait this is Dan?&ldquo; </b></i>She asked looking confused.</p><p><i><b>&rdquo; Daddy I wanna go home!&rdquo; </b></i>Dan sobbed.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s ok baby we&rsquo;ll go home soon.&rdquo; </i></b>He said rubbing circles into the crying boys back</p><p><b>&rdquo; Is this some kind of joke?</b>&ldquo; She asked still looking completely confused.</p><p>Phil was getting angrier by the minute. &ldquo;<b><i>Of course this isn&rsquo;t a joke! Don&rsquo;t you see him crying?&rdquo; </i></b>He asked pointing to the now whimpering boy.</p><p>The women and her daughter didn&rsquo;t say anything and just stared at them. Finally getting fed up Phil pulled Dan up with him and stood up <i><b>&ldquo; I think you owe him an apology.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No way I&rsquo;m not apologizing to him! What I said was true he is too big to be playing here. He&rsquo;s a freak!&rdquo; </i></b>Emily shouted at him tears now forming in her eyes.</p><p>Phil looked at Victoria and the women wouldn&rsquo;t meet his eyes.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you going to make her apologize?&rdquo; </i></b>He demanded.</p><p>Victoria looked at him hateful now.<b><i> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making my daughter apologize to that freak! </i></b>She screamed pointing at Dan.</p><p>This caused the bow hiccuping Dan to begin sobbing again.</p><p>Not even worried about an apology anymore Phil took Dan&rsquo;s hand and started walking away.
