I think it\u2019s a plot that\u2019s been written a million times before, but here\u2019s my take on it.</p><hr><h2><b>If Wishes Were Fishes</b></h2><p>\u201cYou know, sometimes I wish this hadn\u2019t all gotten as big as it has. Like \u2026 we could just have normal lives without people fucking stalking us everywhere we go!\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t usually get angry like this, but the fact that a fan had followed Dan down the street so persistently that he hadn\u2019t felt safe coming home because he didn\u2019t want someone that obsessive to know their address had just pushed him over the edge. Dan shouldn\u2019t feel like he had to take a taxi and drive around before returning to his own home!</p><p>He went to bed that night with his emotions roiling, acknowledging that they\u2019d chosen this life, they\u2019d chosen to live a life where people might follow them around and take creep shots of them and ambush them in airports when they were jetlagged and just wanted to go somewhere to sleep. But sometimes he really did wish they could just live normal lives like everyone else.</p><!-- more --><p>******</p><p>Phil woke the next morning surprised that Dan wasn\u2019t in the bed. Since it was unlikely that he\u2019d woken up before Phil, chances were good that he\u2019d never gone to bed at all and had instead stayed up all night. Again.</p><p>Putting on his glasses, Phil sat up in bed and looked around, only to find the bedroom more of a disaster than usual.</p><p>In fact, the bedroom didn\u2019t look the same at all.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t the right shape, and the duvet wasn\u2019t the right color, and the bed wasn\u2019t even the right size. But Phil had watched enough episodes of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to know he should get up to investigate what else might be different.</p><p>He hesitantly stepped out into the hall, where socks littered the floor, and walked toward where the most light seemed to be coming from, which he presumed would be the lounge.</p><p>Action figures, plushes, photographs, and plants in various stages of death throes decorated the shelves as usual, but only one laptop sat on the coffee table. He walked into the adjacent kitchen to find all the cabinets slightly ajar. One cabinet contained a few mugs, and none of them were Dan\u2019s.</p><p>In fact, he had thus far seen no sign of Dan anywhere in the flat.</p><p>Searching around, Phil eventually located his phone and decided to phone Dan to find out what the heck was going on around here, but Dan wasn\u2019t even listed in his contacts.</p><p>Phil started to get really afraid now. A Twilight Zone world in which Dan Howell didn\u2019t exist was not okay with him! Not for a second!</p><p>Sitting down at his laptop, he googled Dan but only found the Howell family\u2019s familiar phone number in Wokingham. Nothing about Dan himself online, which was obviously extremely strange. Phil didn\u2019t have the closest relationship with Dan\u2019s family, but maybe Dan\u2019s mum could help?</p><p>Phil phoned their number and, luckily, Dan\u2019s mum answered. Phil had a better relationship with her than with Dan\u2019s dad. \u201cKaren,\u201d he sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find Dan. And everything is strange. But I\u2019m hoping if I can just talk to him we can work this out. Do you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>The woman on the phone sounded very stiff when she asked abruptly, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Phil hesitated. Karen should know his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s Phil. Phil Lester. You know \u2026 Dan\u2019s \u2026 friend.\u201d Dan\u2019s family had never, even after all these years, been very good about acknowledging their relationship, so Dan and Phil had chosen to just go along with the fictional platonic housemates story in order to keep the peace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Dan\u2019s?\u201d Karen sounded skeptical.</p><p>Utterly confused and increasingly frightened that Karen not only didn\u2019t recognize his voice but apparently didn\u2019t even recognize his name, Phil said, \u201cYeah. Um \u2026 <i>good</i> friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan doesn\u2019t <i>have</i> any good friends,\u201d Karen replied flatly.</p><p>Phil stared mutely at the phone for a moment with no idea what to say in reply to that. But apparently she knew where Dan was, so he just needed to get Dan\u2019s phone number from her and he\u2019d be able to work this out with Dan. They could work anything out together, even in a Twilight Zone world. What should he say? \u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 um \u2026 friends from way back. We haven\u2019t talked in a while. But I\u2019d really like to get back in touch.\u201d</p><p>Karen sounded suspicious when she asked, \u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil. Phil Lester.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s mum grumbled, \u201cI\u2019ll go see if he\u2019s awake yet,\u201d but Phil was relieved to learn that Dan was nearby and he should be able to speak with him soon.</p><p>A moment later, Dan\u2019s sleepy voice came on the phone, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil cried. \u201cOh my god! I\u2019m so glad to hear your voice! What the heck is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan replied, sounding confused. \u201cPhil Lester \u2026 from back when we used to do YouTube? I mean, it\u2019s good to hear from you, but it\u2019s been ages! How have you been?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widened. Dan sounded like he barely remembered him! And uncomfortable, like maybe they hadn\u2019t parted on the best of terms but Dan was trying to be friendly.</p><p>\u201cUm \u2026 good. I think. I mean, yeah, good.\u201d Phil wondered what he was supposed to say next. \u201cUm \u2026 how have <i>you</i> been?\u201d</p><p>Dan sounded awkward. \u201cOh, you know, I get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing these days?\u201d Phil asked, flailing wildly in an effort to gain some kind of information about the situation.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan sounded embarrassed, \u201cyou know. Still getting benefits \u2026 ever since that thing at university. Living with my parents. It sucks, but \u2026 when you can\u2019t work you do what you can, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan was on benefits? Since university? And he wasn\u2019t able to work? Why?</p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe if we\u2019d really given that YouTube thing a go things would have turned out different, you know? I like to think that, anyway.\u201d Dan sounded both wistful and sad. \u201cBut if wishes were fishes\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what to say to that. They hadn\u2019t gotten seriously involved with YouTube? It started to dawn on him that \u2026 maybe \u2026 without YouTube \u2026 when Dan had his crisis at university, he wouldn\u2019t have had anything else to turn to, to give his life meaning. Had he \u2026 had he fallen into some kind of depression and been unable to find his way out? Had he been living with his parents ever since?</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied hesitantly. \u201cIf wishes were fishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan seemed extremely uncomfortable now. \u201cWhat have you been doing? Since giving up YouTube, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phil had given up YouTube, too? What the heck had he been doing with his life? He glanced around the lounge for some kind of clue, but came up empty. \u201cOh,\u201d he stammered, \u201cthis and that.\u201d He grimaced, unsure what to say. \u201cNothing in particular, I guess.\u201d What would his life had been like if he\u2019d given up YouTube and lost his relationship with Dan all those years ago? He hated to think about it. \u201cI just,\u201d Phil hesitated, then continued, \u201cI just wanted to hear your voice, you know? We were so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice sounded warmer now. \u201cWe were. That was a really good time. I wish\u2026\u201d he trailed off as if stopping himself from saying something he shouldn\u2019t. Then he continued, \u201cI wish maybe we\u2019d given the YouTube thing a more serious try. Maybe now we\u2019d be rich and famous!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied numbly. \u201cMaybe we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should get going,\u201d Dan said, sounding sad. \u201cIt was nice talking to you again, though, and remembering the good times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said again. \u201cThe good times.\u201d</p><p>And then Dan ended the call and Phil simply stood there, holding his phone in his hand, staring at nothing. He and Dan had both quit YouTube? Dan was living with his parents and\u2014if Phil knew anything about him after all these years and could read anything in his voice\u2014was desperately unhappy? What was Phil\u2019s own life like? Did he even want to find out?</p><p>He decided that no. No, he did not want to find out. He wanted to go back to bed, and fall back asleep, and wake up to everything being normal again. The phone rang in his hand, and an unfamiliar number was identified as \u201cWork.\u201d Phil silenced the phone and dropped it on the rug as if it had burnt the skin of his hand.</p><p>No. He definitely didn\u2019t want to find out anything more about this world. He just wanted his life back, and\u2014most of all\u2014he wanted Dan back.</p><p>So he walked back into the unfamiliar bedroom, crawled back into the unfamiliar bed, and pulled up the unfamiliar duvet until it completely covered his head. \u201cI wish I had it all back,\u201d he murmured to himself, fighting tears. \u201cI just want it all back.\u201d</p><p>It took him a long time, and he didn\u2019t succeed in his struggle against the tears, but eventually he did fall back asleep.</p><p>******</p><p>Phil woke with his head still under the duvet and dreaded finding out what existed outside this bed. Had it all been a terrible dream? Or would he still be in that horrible flat with all the socks on the floor and only one laptop and none of Dan\u2019s mugs in the cabinet?</p><p>Then he felt the bed shift and an arm snaked around his waist, pulling him close to a warm body. \u201cWhy do you have the duvet pulled up over your head?\u201d Dan\u2019s sleepy voice asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even see you to give you a kiss when I came to bed.\u201d</p><p>Phil pulled the duvet down abruptly and turned to look at Dan\u2019s beautiful puffy sleep face with his hair all sticking up and the creases from the pillowcase on his cheek, and Phil wrapped his arms around him and held him tighter than he ever had before.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Dan exclaimed, sounding a bit more awake. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that for? Bad dreams?\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed Dan on the lips, then on both his cheeks and his nose and his chin and his forehead and then his nose again until Dan was laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in bed with an enthusiastic puppy!\u201d he giggled.</p><p>\u201cThe worst dreams,\u201d Phil finally answered him, going back to just holding him close. \u201cThe worstest of worstest worst dreams ever.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his face away slightly so that he could give Phil a soft, gentle kiss, and then said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had nightmares. But everything\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to Phil\u2019s eyes as he nodded. He couldn\u2019t speak past the lump in his throat, so he just nodded again and gave Dan another kiss.</p><p>They lay there together in bed for a long time before Dan leaned over to pick up his phone and groaned, \u201cOh, it is <i>way</i> too early! I was up late playing Skyrim and I want to sleep at least another three hundred hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil replied, finally calming down a bit. \u201cNo, let\u2019s \u2026 let\u2019s go to the shopping centre.\u201d</p><p>Dan stiffened. \u201cAre you forgetting about yesterday? I\u2019m not really wanting to run into any fans today, Phil. I just want to hide at home and pretend like we\u2019re normal people who don\u2019t have gazillions of people watching our every move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut most of them aren\u2019t like that,\u201d Phil replied quickly. \u201cMost of them aren\u2019t going to follow us around or do anything creepy \u2026 they just love us.\u201d Dan still looked dubious. Phil kissed him again and then stroked his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky to have so many people who love us. Maybe it would be good to go out and remind ourselves that most of them are really sweet and kind. Think about the meet-and-greets, how happy they make you. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to just \u2026 just meet some people who like what we do? People who say we make their lives better \u2026 just by being us and doing what we love?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cWell, when you say it like <i>that</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan hauled himself out of bed with a groan and stretched, then gave Phil a grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go out and meet our adoring public.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, knowing that Dan was joking \u2026 and yet that what he said was true at the same time. There were a lot of people who adored them \u2026 and he and Dan adored their fans, too. It was like a mutual adoration society composed of millions of people.</p><p>It was time to go out and experience some mutual adoration. Sometimes it might be the best medicine.</p>",

It started to dawn on him that \u2026 maybe \u2026 without YouTube \u2026 when Dan had his crisis at university, he wouldn\u2019t have had anything else to turn to, to give his life meaning. Had he \u2026 had he fallen into some kind of depression and been unable to find his way out? Had he been living with his parents ever since?</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied hesitantly. \u201cIf wishes were fishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan seemed extremely uncomfortable now. \u201cWhat have you been doing? Since giving up YouTube, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phil had given up YouTube, too? What the heck had he been doing with his life? He glanced around the lounge for some kind of clue, but came up empty. \u201cOh,\u201d he stammered, \u201cthis and that.\u201d He grimaced, unsure what to say. \u201cNothing in particular, I guess.\u201d What would his life had been like if he\u2019d given up YouTube and lost his relationship with Dan all those years ago? He hated to think about it. \u201cI just,\u201d Phil hesitated, then continued, \u201cI just wanted to hear your voice, you know? We were so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice sounded warmer now. \u201cWe were. That was a really good time. I wish\u2026\u201d he trailed off as if stopping himself from saying something he shouldn\u2019t. Then he continued, \u201cI wish maybe we\u2019d given the YouTube thing a more serious try. Maybe now we\u2019d be rich and famous!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied numbly. \u201cMaybe we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should get going,\u201d Dan said, sounding sad. \u201cIt was nice talking to you again, though, and remembering the good times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said again. \u201cThe good times.\u201d</p><p>And then Dan ended the call and Phil simply stood there, holding his phone in his hand, staring at nothing. He and Dan had both quit YouTube? Dan was living with his parents and\u2014if Phil knew anything about him after all these years and could read anything in his voice\u2014was desperately unhappy? What was Phil\u2019s own life like? Did he even want to find out?</p><p>He decided that no. No, he did not want to find out. He wanted to go back to bed, and fall back asleep, and wake up to everything being normal again. The phone rang in his hand, and an unfamiliar number was identified as \u201cWork.\u201d Phil silenced the phone and dropped it on the rug as if it had burnt the skin of his hand.</p><p>No. He definitely didn\u2019t want to find out anything more about this world. He just wanted his life back, and\u2014most of all\u2014he wanted Dan back.</p><p>So he walked back into the unfamiliar bedroom, crawled back into the unfamiliar bed, and pulled up the unfamiliar duvet until it completely covered his head. \u201cI wish I had it all back,\u201d he murmured to himself, fighting tears. \u201cI just want it all back.\u201d</p><p>It took him a long time, and he didn\u2019t succeed in his struggle against the tears, but eventually he did fall back asleep.</p><p>******</p><p>Phil woke with his head still under the duvet and dreaded finding out what existed outside this bed. Had it all been a terrible dream? Or would he still be in that horrible flat with all the socks on the floor and only one laptop and none of Dan\u2019s mugs in the cabinet?</p><p>Then he felt the bed shift and an arm snaked around his waist, pulling him close to a warm body. \u201cWhy do you have the duvet pulled up over your head?\u201d Dan\u2019s sleepy voice asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even see you to give you a kiss when I came to bed.\u201d</p><p>Phil pulled the duvet down abruptly and turned to look at Dan\u2019s beautiful puffy sleep face with his hair all sticking up and the creases from the pillowcase on his cheek, and Phil wrapped his arms around him and held him tighter than he ever had before.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Dan exclaimed, sounding a bit more awake. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that for? Bad dreams?\u201d</p><p>Phil kissed Dan on the lips, then on both his cheeks and his nose and his chin and his forehead and then his nose again until Dan was laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in bed with an enthusiastic puppy!\u201d he giggled.</p><p>\u201cThe worst dreams,\u201d Phil finally answered him, going back to just holding him close. \u201cThe worstest of worstest worst dreams ever.\u201d</p><p>Dan pulled his face away slightly so that he could give Phil a soft, gentle kiss, and then said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had nightmares. But everything\u2019s okay now.\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to Phil\u2019s eyes as he nodded. He couldn\u2019t speak past the lump in his throat, so he just nodded again and gave Dan another kiss.</p><p>They lay there together in bed for a long time before Dan leaned over to pick up his phone and groaned, \u201cOh, it is <i>way</i> too early! I was up late playing Skyrim and I want to sleep at least another three hundred hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Phil replied, finally calming down a bit. \u201cNo, let\u2019s \u2026 let\u2019s go to the shopping centre.\u201d</p><p>Dan stiffened. \u201cAre you forgetting about yesterday? I\u2019m not really wanting to run into any fans today, Phil. I just want to hide at home and pretend like we\u2019re normal people who don\u2019t have gazillions of people watching our every move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut most of them aren\u2019t like that,\u201d Phil replied quickly. \u201cMost of them aren\u2019t going to follow us around or do anything creepy \u2026 they just love us.\u201d Dan still looked dubious. Phil kissed him again and then stroked his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky to have so many people who love us. Maybe it would be good to go out and remind ourselves that most of them are really sweet and kind. Think about the meet-and-greets, how happy they make you. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to just \u2026 just meet some people who like what we do? People who say we make their lives better \u2026 just by being us and doing what we love?\u201d</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cWell, when you say it like <i>that</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan hauled himself out of bed with a groan and stretched, then gave Phil a grin. \u201cLet\u2019s go out and meet our adoring public.\u201d</p><p>Phil laughed, knowing that Dan was joking \u2026 and yet that what he said was true at the same time. There were a lot of people who adored them \u2026 and he and Dan adored their fans, too. It was like a mutual adoration society composed of millions of people.</p><p>It was time to go out and experience some mutual adoration. Sometimes it might be the best medicine.</p>",

I think it\u2019s a plot that\u2019s been written a million times before, but here\u2019s my take on it.</p><hr><h2><b>If Wishes Were Fishes</b></h2><p>\u201cYou know, sometimes I wish this hadn\u2019t all gotten as big as it has. Like \u2026 we could just have normal lives without people fucking stalking us everywhere we go!\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t usually get angry like this, but the fact that a fan had followed Dan down the street so persistently that he hadn\u2019t felt safe coming home because he didn\u2019t want someone that obsessive to know their address had just pushed him over the edge. Dan shouldn\u2019t feel like he had to take a taxi and drive around before returning to his own home!</p><p>He went to bed that night with his emotions roiling, acknowledging that they\u2019d chosen this life, they\u2019d chosen to live a life where people might follow them around and take creep shots of them and ambush them in airports when they were jetlagged and just wanted to go somewhere to sleep. But sometimes he really did wish they could just live normal lives like everyone else.</p>[[MORE]]<p>******</p><p>Phil woke the next morning surprised that Dan wasn\u2019t in the bed. Since it was unlikely that he\u2019d woken up before Phil, chances were good that he\u2019d never gone to bed at all and had instead stayed up all night. Again.</p><p>Putting on his glasses, Phil sat up in bed and looked around, only to find the bedroom more of a disaster than usual.</p><p>In fact, the bedroom didn\u2019t look the same at all.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t the right shape, and the duvet wasn\u2019t the right color, and the bed wasn\u2019t even the right size. But Phil had watched enough episodes of \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to know he should get up to investigate what else might be different.</p><p>He hesitantly stepped out into the hall, where socks littered the floor, and walked toward where the most light seemed to be coming from, which he presumed would be the lounge.</p><p>Action figures, plushes, photographs, and plants in various stages of death throes decorated the shelves as usual, but only one laptop sat on the coffee table. He walked into the adjacent kitchen to find all the cabinets slightly ajar. One cabinet contained a few mugs, and none of them were Dan\u2019s.</p><p>In fact, he had thus far seen no sign of Dan anywhere in the flat.</p><p>Searching around, Phil eventually located his phone and decided to phone Dan to find out what the heck was going on around here, but Dan wasn\u2019t even listed in his contacts.</p><p>Phil started to get really afraid now. A Twilight Zone world in which Dan Howell didn\u2019t exist was not okay with him! Not for a second!</p><p>Sitting down at his laptop, he googled Dan but only found the Howell family\u2019s familiar phone number in Wokingham. Nothing about Dan himself online, which was obviously extremely strange. Phil didn\u2019t have the closest relationship with Dan\u2019s family, but maybe Dan\u2019s mum could help?</p><p>Phil phoned their number and, luckily, Dan\u2019s mum answered. Phil had a better relationship with her than with Dan\u2019s dad. \u201cKaren,\u201d he sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find Dan. And everything is strange. But I\u2019m hoping if I can just talk to him we can work this out. Do you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>The woman on the phone sounded very stiff when she asked abruptly, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Phil hesitated. Karen should know his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s Phil. Phil Lester. You know \u2026 Dan\u2019s \u2026 friend.\u201d Dan\u2019s family had never, even after all these years, been very good about acknowledging their relationship, so Dan and Phil had chosen to just go along with the fictional platonic housemates story in order to keep the peace.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Dan\u2019s?\u201d Karen sounded skeptical.</p><p>Utterly confused and increasingly frightened that Karen not only didn\u2019t recognize his voice but apparently didn\u2019t even recognize his name, Phil said, \u201cYeah. Um \u2026 <i>good</i> friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan doesn\u2019t <i>have</i> any good friends,\u201d Karen replied flatly.</p><p>Phil stared mutely at the phone for a moment with no idea what to say in reply to that. But apparently she knew where Dan was, so he just needed to get Dan\u2019s phone number from her and he\u2019d be able to work this out with Dan. They could work anything out together, even in a Twilight Zone world. What should he say? \u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 um \u2026 friends from way back. We haven\u2019t talked in a while. But I\u2019d really like to get back in touch.\u201d</p><p>Karen sounded suspicious when she asked, \u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil. Phil Lester.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s mum grumbled, \u201cI\u2019ll go see if he\u2019s awake yet,\u201d but Phil was relieved to learn that Dan was nearby and he should be able to speak with him soon.</p><p>A moment later, Dan\u2019s sleepy voice came on the phone, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan!\u201d Phil cried. \u201cOh my god! I\u2019m so glad to hear your voice! What the heck is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil?\u201d Dan replied, sounding confused. \u201cPhil Lester \u2026 from back when we used to do YouTube? I mean, it\u2019s good to hear from you, but it\u2019s been ages! How have you been?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes widened. Dan sounded like he barely remembered him! And uncomfortable, like maybe they hadn\u2019t parted on the best of terms but Dan was trying to be friendly.</p><p>\u201cUm \u2026 good. I think. I mean, yeah, good.\u201d Phil wondered what he was supposed to say next. \u201cUm \u2026 how have <i>you</i> been?\u201d</p><p>Dan sounded awkward. \u201cOh, you know, I get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing these days?\u201d Phil asked, flailing wildly in an effort to gain some kind of information about the situation.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan sounded embarrassed, \u201cyou know. Still getting benefits \u2026 ever since that thing at university. Living with my parents. It sucks, but \u2026 when you can\u2019t work you do what you can, right?\u201d</p><p>Dan was on benefits? Since university? And he wasn\u2019t able to work? Why?</p><p>\u201cI mean, maybe if we\u2019d really given that YouTube thing a go things would have turned out different, you know? I like to think that, anyway.\u201d Dan sounded both wistful and sad. \u201cBut if wishes were fishes\u2026\u201d</p><p>Phil didn\u2019t know what to say to that. They hadn\u2019t gotten seriously involved with YouTube? It started to dawn on him that \u2026 maybe \u2026 without YouTube \u2026 when Dan had his crisis at university, he wouldn\u2019t have had anything else to turn to, to give his life meaning. Had he \u2026 had he fallen into some kind of depression and been unable to find his way out? Had he been living with his parents ever since?</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied hesitantly. \u201cIf wishes were fishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dan seemed extremely uncomfortable now. \u201cWhat have you been doing? Since giving up YouTube, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Phil had given up YouTube, too? What the heck had he been doing with his life? He glanced around the lounge for some kind of clue, but came up empty. \u201cOh,\u201d he stammered, \u201cthis and that.\u201d He grimaced, unsure what to say. \u201cNothing in particular, I guess.\u201d What would his life had been like if he\u2019d given up YouTube and lost his relationship with Dan all those years ago?

We were so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan\u2019s voice sounded warmer now. \u201cWe were. That was a really good time. I wish\u2026\u201d he trailed off as if stopping himself from saying something he shouldn\u2019t. Then he continued, \u201cI wish maybe we\u2019d given the YouTube thing a more serious try. Maybe now we\u2019d be rich and famous!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil replied numbly. \u201cMaybe we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I should get going,\u201d Dan said, sounding sad. \u201cIt was nice talking to you again, though, and remembering the good times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil said again. \u201cThe good times.\u201d</p><p>And then Dan ended the call and Phil simply stood there, holding his phone in his hand, staring at nothing.

The phone rang in his hand, and an unfamiliar number was identified as \u201cWork.\u201d Phil silenced the phone and dropped it on the rug as if it had burnt the skin of his hand.</p><p>No. He definitely didn\u2019t want to find out anything more about this world. He just wanted his life back, and\u2014most of all\u2014he wanted Dan back.</p><p>So he walked back into the unfamiliar bedroom, crawled back into the unfamiliar bed, and pulled up the unfamiliar duvet until it completely covered his head. \u201cI wish I had it all back,\u201d he murmured to himself, fighting tears. \u201cI just want it all back.\u201d</p><p>It took him a long time, and he didn\u2019t succeed in his struggle against the tears, but eventually he did fall back asleep.</p><p>******</p><p>Phil woke with his head still under the duvet and dreaded finding out what existed outside this bed.

But sometimes he really did wish they could just live normal lives like everyone else.</p><p>******</p><p>Phil woke the next morning surprised that Dan wasn&rsquo;t in the bed. Since it was unlikely that he&rsquo;d woken up before Phil, chances were good that he&rsquo;d never gone to bed at all and had instead stayed up all night. Again.</p><p>Putting on his glasses, Phil sat up in bed and looked around, only to find the bedroom more of a disaster than usual.</p><p>In fact, the bedroom didn&rsquo;t look the same at all.</p><p>The room wasn&rsquo;t the right shape, and the duvet wasn&rsquo;t the right color, and the bed wasn&rsquo;t even the right size. But Phil had watched enough episodes of &ldquo;The Twilight Zone&rdquo; to know he should get up to investigate what else might be different.</p><p>He hesitantly stepped out into the hall, where socks littered the floor, and walked toward where the most light seemed to be coming from, which he presumed would be the lounge.</p><p>Action figures, plushes, photographs, and plants in various stages of death throes decorated the shelves as usual, but only one laptop sat on the coffee table. He walked into the adjacent kitchen to find all the cabinets slightly ajar. One cabinet contained a few mugs, and none of them were Dan&rsquo;s.</p><p>In fact, he had thus far seen no sign of Dan anywhere in the flat.</p><p>Searching around, Phil eventually located his phone and decided to phone Dan to find out what the heck was going on around here, but Dan wasn&rsquo;t even listed in his contacts.</p><p>Phil started to get really afraid now. A Twilight Zone world in which Dan Howell didn&rsquo;t exist was not okay with him! Not for a second!</p><p>Sitting down at his laptop, he googled Dan but only found the Howell family&rsquo;s familiar phone number in Wokingham. Nothing about Dan himself online, which was obviously extremely strange. Phil didn&rsquo;t have the closest relationship with Dan&rsquo;s family, but maybe Dan&rsquo;s mum could help?</p><p>Phil phoned their number and, luckily, Dan&rsquo;s mum answered. Phil had a better relationship with her than with Dan&rsquo;s dad. &ldquo;Karen,&rdquo; he sighed in relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find Dan. And everything is strange. But I&rsquo;m hoping if I can just talk to him we can work this out. Do you know where he is?&rdquo;</p><p>The woman on the phone sounded very stiff when she asked abruptly, &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Phil hesitated. Karen should know his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &hellip; it&rsquo;s Phil. Phil Lester. You know &hellip; Dan&rsquo;s &hellip; friend.&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s family had never, even after all these years, been very good about acknowledging their relationship, so Dan and Phil had chosen to just go along with the fictional platonic housemates story in order to keep the peace.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a friend of Dan&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Karen sounded skeptical.</p><p>Utterly confused and increasingly frightened that Karen not only didn&rsquo;t recognize his voice but apparently didn&rsquo;t even recognize his name, Phil said, &ldquo;Yeah. Um &hellip; <i>good</i> friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan doesn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> any good friends,&rdquo; Karen replied flatly.</p><p>Phil stared mutely at the phone for a moment with no idea what to say in reply to that. But apparently she knew where Dan was, so he just needed to get Dan&rsquo;s phone number from her and he&rsquo;d be able to work this out with Dan. They could work anything out together, even in a Twilight Zone world. What should he say? &ldquo;We&rsquo;re &hellip; um &hellip; friends from way back. We haven&rsquo;t talked in a while. But I&rsquo;d really like to get back in touch.&rdquo;</p><p>Karen sounded suspicious when she asked, &ldquo;What was your name again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil. Phil Lester.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s mum grumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go see if he&rsquo;s awake yet,&rdquo; but Phil was relieved to learn that Dan was nearby and he should be able to speak with him soon.</p><p>A moment later, Dan&rsquo;s sleepy voice came on the phone, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; Phil cried. &ldquo;Oh my god! I&rsquo;m so glad to hear your voice! What the heck is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil?&rdquo; Dan replied, sounding confused. &ldquo;Phil Lester &hellip; from back when we used to do YouTube? I mean, it&rsquo;s good to hear from you, but it&rsquo;s been ages! How have you been?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes widened. Dan sounded like he barely remembered him! And uncomfortable, like maybe they hadn&rsquo;t parted on the best of terms but Dan was trying to be friendly.</p><p>&ldquo;Um &hellip; good. I think. I mean, yeah, good.&rdquo; Phil wondered what he was supposed to say next. &ldquo;Um &hellip; how have <i>you</i> been?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan sounded awkward. &ldquo;Oh, you know, I get by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing these days?&rdquo; Phil asked, flailing wildly in an effort to gain some kind of information about the situation.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan sounded embarrassed, &ldquo;you know. Still getting benefits &hellip; ever since that thing at university. Living with my parents. It sucks, but &hellip; when you can&rsquo;t work you do what you can, right?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan was on benefits? Since university? And he wasn&rsquo;t able to work? Why?</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, maybe if we&rsquo;d really given that YouTube thing a go things would have turned out different, you know? I like to think that, anyway.&rdquo; Dan sounded both wistful and sad. &ldquo;But if wishes were fishes&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Phil didn&rsquo;t know what to say to that. They hadn&rsquo;t gotten seriously involved with YouTube? It started to dawn on him that &hellip; maybe &hellip; without YouTube &hellip; when Dan had his crisis at university, he wouldn&rsquo;t have had anything else to turn to, to give his life meaning. Had he &hellip; had he fallen into some kind of depression and been unable to find his way out? Had he been living with his parents ever since?</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied hesitantly. &ldquo;If wishes were fishes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Dan seemed extremely uncomfortable now. &ldquo;What have you been doing? Since giving up YouTube, I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil had given up YouTube, too? What the heck had he been doing with his life? He glanced around the lounge for some kind of clue, but came up empty. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;this and that.&rdquo; He grimaced, unsure what to say. &ldquo;Nothing in particular, I guess.&rdquo; What would his life had been like if he&rsquo;d given up YouTube and lost his relationship with Dan all those years ago? He hated to think about it. &ldquo;I just,&rdquo; Phil hesitated, then continued, &ldquo;I just wanted to hear your voice, you know? We were so close.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice sounded warmer now. &ldquo;We were. That was a really good time. I wish&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off as if stopping himself from saying something he shouldn&rsquo;t. Then he continued, &ldquo;I wish maybe we&rsquo;d given the YouTube thing a more serious try. Maybe now we&rsquo;d be rich and famous!&rdquo; He laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil replied numbly. &ldquo;Maybe we would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I should get going,&rdquo; Dan said, sounding sad. &ldquo;It was nice talking to you again, though, and remembering the good times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil said again. &ldquo;The good times.&rdquo;</p><p>And then Dan ended the call and Phil simply stood there, holding his phone in his hand, staring at nothing. He and Dan had both quit YouTube? Dan was living with his parents and&mdash;if Phil knew anything about him after all these years and could read anything in his voice&mdash;was desperately unhappy? What was Phil&rsquo;s own life like? Did he even want to find out?</p><p>He decided that no. No, he did not want to find out. He wanted to go back to bed, and fall back asleep, and wake up to everything being normal again. The phone rang in his hand, and an unfamiliar number was identified as &ldquo;Work.&rdquo; Phil silenced the phone and dropped it on the rug as if it had burnt the skin of his hand.</p><p>No. He definitely didn&rsquo;t want to find out anything more about this world. He just wanted his life back, and&mdash;most of all&mdash;he wanted Dan back.</p><p>So he walked back into the unfamiliar bedroom, crawled back into the unfamiliar bed, and pulled up the unfamiliar duvet until it completely covered his head. &ldquo;I wish I had it all back,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, fighting tears. &ldquo;I just want it all back.&rdquo;</p><p>It took him a long time, and he didn&rsquo;t succeed in his struggle against the tears, but eventually he did fall back asleep.</p><p>******</p><p>Phil woke with his head still under the duvet and dreaded finding out what existed outside this bed. Had it all been a terrible dream? Or would he still be in that horrible flat with all the socks on the floor and only one laptop and none of Dan&rsquo;s mugs in the cabinet?</p><p>Then he felt the bed shift and an arm snaked around his waist, pulling him close to a warm body. &ldquo;Why do you have the duvet pulled up over your head?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s sleepy voice asked. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even see you to give you a kiss when I came to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil pulled the duvet down abruptly and turned to look at Dan&rsquo;s beautiful puffy sleep face with his hair all sticking up and the creases from the pillowcase on his cheek, and Phil wrapped his arms around him and held him tighter than he ever had before.</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, sounding a bit more awake. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that for? Bad dreams?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil kissed Dan on the lips, then on both his cheeks and his nose and his chin and his forehead and then his nose again until Dan was laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in bed with an enthusiastic puppy!&rdquo; he giggled.</p><p>&ldquo;The worst dreams,&rdquo; Phil finally answered him, going back to just holding him close. &ldquo;The worstest of worstest worst dreams ever.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan pulled his face away slightly so that he could give Phil a soft, gentle kiss, and then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had nightmares. But everything&rsquo;s okay now.&rdquo;</p><p>Tears sprang to Phil&rsquo;s eyes as he nodded. He couldn&rsquo;t speak past the lump in his throat, so he just nodded again and gave Dan another kiss.</p><p>They lay there together in bed for a long time before Dan leaned over to pick up his phone and groaned, &ldquo;Oh, it is <i>way</i> too early! I was up late playing Skyrim and I want to sleep at least another three hundred hours!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil replied, finally calming down a bit. &ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s &hellip; let&rsquo;s go to the shopping centre.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stiffened. &ldquo;Are you forgetting about yesterday? I&rsquo;m not really wanting to run into any fans today, Phil. I just want to hide at home and pretend like we&rsquo;re normal people who don&rsquo;t have gazillions of people watching our every move.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But most of them aren&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; Phil replied quickly. &ldquo;Most of them aren&rsquo;t going to follow us around or do anything creepy &hellip; they just love us.&rdquo; Dan still looked dubious. Phil kissed him again and then stroked his cheek. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really lucky to have so many people who love us. Maybe it would be good to go out and remind ourselves that most of them are really sweet and kind. Think about the meet-and-greets, how happy they make you. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to just &hellip; just meet some people who like what we do? People who say we make their lives better &hellip; just by being us and doing what we love?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan rolled his eyes and sighed. &ldquo;Well, when you say it like <i>that</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan hauled himself out of bed with a groan and stretched, then gave Phil a grin. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out and meet our adoring public.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil laughed, knowing that Dan was joking &hellip; and yet that what he said was true at the same time. There were a lot of people who adored them &hellip; and he and Dan adored their fans, too. It was like a mutual adoration society composed of millions of people.</p><p>It was time to go out and experience some mutual adoration. Sometimes it might be the best medicine.</p>",
