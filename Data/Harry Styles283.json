You\u2019re drunk now, but you\u2019ve never been a lightweight drunk who had no control over her actions. You\u2019re just a little looser now: a lot more loud, and a lot less shy. The middle of the first floor of Harry\u2019s mansion has been turned into something reminiscent of a club now \u2014 with the lights down low and the music up high. You\u2019re dancing with a couple of girls, singing a 2018 banger at the top of your lungs when you back up into the Harry Styles himself.</p><p>\u201cYou again!\u201d You shout, louder than you\u2019re supposed to, and he only laughs at you, large hands gripping the sides of your arms to steady you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk!\u201d He exclaims. As if he can\u2019t believe you\u2019re drunk. As if it\u2019s the most exciting thing ever to see you intoxicated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d you deny, shaking your head. \u00a0You open your mouth to say something else \u2014 god, you were just about to ask him to dance with you \u2014 when finely manicured hands cover Harry\u2019s eyes. By instinct, he lets you go and puts his hands atop the ones on his face. Behind him, you can see a familiar face. A model you see basically everyday. Kendall Jenner. Another one of his exes.</p><p>You turn your back and weave your way through the dancing bodies as soon as he\u2019s turned around to get a good look at Kendall. It\u2019s funny how it\u2019s at this very party that something big dawns upon you.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d you mumble to your new, full glass of champagne glass. \u201cI think I like Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all.\u201d The random man next to you drawls.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to come to terms with. Ever since you\u2019ve met him in person, you swore never to like him as anything more than a friend. It wouldn\u2019t do any good, you always said, and you didn\u2019t want Harry to think you only hung out with him just because you were into him. You enjoy your conversations with him way too much \u2014 he was a very insightful person and had a way with words. You always look forward to your conversations, and some even served as inspiration for your little pieces of poem and prose.</p><p>It\u2019s even harder to come to terms with because it took his exes reuniting with him right in front of you for you to have realized your feelings. They\u2019re flawless girls, and you believe that you can\u2019t compare to them at any aspect at all. Having feelings for Harry is no good, you believe, because he\u2019d never feel the same. No one ever feels the same about you as you do for them.</p><p>You try not to mope the rest of the night away. Try being the keyword.</p><p>It\u2019s not even midnight when you decide that it\u2019s time to go home.</p><p>You bid everyone that you\u2019re with that you\u2019re leaving, but since everything was getting loud and rowdy, nobody cared very much. </p><p><i>\u201cThank you so much for inviting me to your party, it was so good to see you again. I had a great time. Congratulations once more on the success of your tour! Proud of you. x\u201d</i> you send him a text as soon as you got home to your one-story residence, that text being polite and sincere. You don\u2019t expect a reply, especially when you know his party was going in full-swing at the moment. So it surprises you when you do receive a text back not a minute later. </p><p><i>\u201cIt was great seeing you again. Thanks for coming. Didn\u2019t get the chance to tell you earlier, but you were radiant tonight. xx\u201d </i>read his reply.</p><p>You didn\u2019t bother replying, instead choosing to leave him on read due to the turmoil you were currently having.</p><p>You like Harry. Your friend Harry. <i>The </i>Harry.</p><p>And back at the party you were so,<i> so </i>undeniably jealous of both Camille and Kendall. They\u2019re everything you\u2019re not, and you sigh into your pillow as you remember how good they looked with Harry. You couldn\u2019t ever compare. Harry is simply on a whole other level than you are, and liking him would only lead to crushed feelings.\u00a0</p><p>The next day, you convince yourself that you\u2019ll get over your feelings soon enough. It\u2019s just a crush, you tell yourself, and it\u2019ll be easy to get over with if you just don\u2019t think of Harry at all.</p><p>You always express yourself through your writing, and it helps you move on and even immortalize the things you go through in life.\u00a0You tweet something that\u2019s been ringing in your head since last night, a simple line you can relate to at the moment that you\u2019re sure your followers would appreciate as well:</p><p><i><b>All around you is gold,</b></i></p><p><i><b>I am mere silver. </b></i></p><p>It\u2019s that night when you get a new message from your<i> friend</i> Harry.</p><p><i>\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t realize, but I prefer mere silver over gold any day.\u201d</i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>gold and silver.</h1><p><b>summary: </b>In which you&rsquo;re jealous that Harry&rsquo;s exes are at his post-tour party. (But you have no right to feel that way.)</p><p><b>word count:</b> 1.5k&nbsp;</p><p><b>note:</b>&nbsp;ah, my first post, from the first request I&rsquo;ve ever gotten! I do hope you all like this. Feedback is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>His hug is warm, tight, and all too familiar. You breathe in his scent and grin into the crook of his neck. Your dusty rose lipstick smears a little on the collar of his expensive white dress shirt, but you pretend you don&rsquo;t notice. &ldquo;Congratulations on your tour,&rdquo; you tell Harry Styles in lieu of a proper greeting as soon as you&rsquo;ve spotted him in the crowd. Tonight is a special one: Harry&rsquo;s invited everyone special in his life to his new LA home, to celebrate the success of his first ever world tour.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he murmurs after he&rsquo;s said your name, voice sounding as warm as his hug felt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you made it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I live ten minutes away. Of course I made it.&rdquo; You grin up at him, and he grins right back. Your friendship with Harry is slightly new &mdash; you&rsquo;re a published poet, and he happens to love your first book. It&rsquo;s crazy to think that somewhere in his vast and luxurious mansion rests an autographed copy of your book, <i>Infrangible</i>. Your teenage crush, <i>the</i> Harry Styles, thinks your poems are &mdash; in his very own words &mdash; &ldquo;otherworldly and touching to the soul&rdquo;. It took a follow, a couple of messages, and a one-time trip together to a gelato place to establish your friendship, but you were thankful Harry&rsquo;s in your life. You&rsquo;re at the party as his actual friend, and it feels nice. It feels even nicer to see him.</p><p>His grin only gets wider, his eyes sparkling with mirth as he gazes down at you. &ldquo;Somehow, I feel offended with that statement. Does that mean if you were to live further you&rsquo;d &mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t get to finish his statement. Somebody bumps into him, and his gaze shifts over from you to them. </p><p>You recognize that somebody as Camille Rowe.</p><p>Harry and Camille tower over you, and suddenly you feel out of place. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; the blonde model croons, and they exchange an embrace all too similar to the one you&rsquo;ve shared with him just a second ago. But this time, the hug lingers. You feel like an outsider, almost, witnessing this scene unfold in front of you. Witnessing as one of Harry&rsquo;s hands slide down to the small of her back. Witnessing as she presses a soft kiss to his cheek. You look away.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that&hellip; Shawn Mendes over there,&rdquo; you murmur, feigning interest. You don&rsquo;t even bother saying your goodbye, not when the pair haven&rsquo;t even pulled away from their hug yet.</p><p>You get yourself a drink, and reconnect with some familiar faces. Being a young poet with a book that&rsquo;s been hyped all over the world comes with the perk of knowing a lot of celebrities and not freaking out anymore about them. You&rsquo;re still rendered starstruck here and there, but you&rsquo;re calm and collected as someone important pulls you over to their little group and introduces you to everyone in it. This someone is named Olly Alexander from Years and Years. You momentarily forget all about Harry and Camille, except a few drinks later when you&rsquo;re borderline tipsy and have lost interest in whatever the topic being discussed is, you turn your head and see that Harry and Camille are getting cozy in a corner, talking about something. Whatever they&rsquo;re talking about, it seems important. Intimate.</p><p>A weird feeling settles in your stomach as your shoulders slump and your lips tug down into a slightly sad curve. </p><p>At that moment, Harry catches your gaze. Perplexed, you shoot him an awkward smile and turn away immediately. Heat burns your cheeks red &mdash; you must&rsquo;ve looked silly to him, must&rsquo;ve thought you were staring at them (which, you were). You don&rsquo;t see Harry smile to himself. And you definitely don&rsquo;t hear him tell Camille that <i>it was definitely nice to see her again, but no, he was definitely not about to exchange friendly kisses with her</i>. You don&rsquo;t see Camille laugh genuinely, no bitterness to her as she pats him on the shoulder, congratulates him on everything, and goes off to find other people to mingle with.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a little later when you&rsquo;re on the dance floor that you bump into Harry again.

The one thing I\u2019ve been looking forward to since the first day I spent in this hell hole; my high school graduation. </p><p>I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s really not <i>that</i> big of a deal and all, but then I\u2019d be lying. This has been the only thing I\u2019ve been talking about for the last nine months, and now that it\u2019s finally here I can barely contain my excitement. </p><p>I\u2019m currently standing at the large entrance of my school watching the crowds of proud and excited families be greeted by their graduate, and get directed towards the football field where the ceremony is to be held. I glance down at my outfit, and smooth out the wrinkles that have formed on the white floral dress I\u2019m wearing; letting out a sigh. My long brown hair is still in it\u2019s neat curls mum did for me this morning, and I haven\u2019t cried yet so I know my makeup is ok too. </p><p>The heels I\u2019m wearing give me enough height to get a good look at the crowd, but I can\u2019t help the frown that forms when I still can\u2019t see them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be here Em,\u201d a voice speaks up from behind me and I instantly know it\u2019s my brother. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say and turn to face him. \u201cThey\u2019re probably on their way from the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell actually it looks like they\u2019re here now,\u201d my twin says and points behind me. I turn around and a wide smile stretches across my mouth as I see everyone. </p><p>Mum, Darcy, Grandma Anne, and Aunt Gemma are all making their way up the steps towards us; all smiling widely. I hug all of them and start looking around behind them, in search of the obvious missing person from the group. \u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent and looks away from me, except for Darcy. She looks around at the other three, and shakes her head disapprovingly when they don\u2019t say anything. \u201cOk, I guess I\u2019ll be the one to tell them,\u201d my older sister says before sending Ethan and I a sympathetic glance.\u00a0\u201cDad\u2019s flight got delayed. He thinks he can still make it in time, but just won&rsquo;t be here for the first half of the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>My heart instantly plummets into my stomach, and I know tears are beginning to show in my eyes. Dad has been away for well over a month now working on a new album; which is amazing, and I can\u2019t be mad about that. But, the day he left I was worried he wasn&rsquo;t going to make it back for our graduation and told him&hellip; He promised me otherwise, yet here we are.</p><p>Ethan looks down at the ground and lets out a breath.\u00a0\u201cIf you follow the crowd you\u2019ll find where everyone is being seated,\u201d he starts and takes a couple steps back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my gown and cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlick,\u201d Mum says and steps after him but he just turns around and walks though the doors. She looks absolutely defeated watching him leave, so she turns to look at me desperately.\u00a0\u201cSquirt, your dad is going to make-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going to go after him,\u201d I cut her off and take a step away. I turn my back to my family and start running after my twin, not looking back. I push through the large doors of the school to find him walking towards the auditorium with his back to me, so I try to get his attention. \u201cEthan, wait!\u201d</p><p>He comes to a stop and slowly turns around to face me, crossing his arms as he does so. I reach him and can see the iciness that glosses his green eyes, as soon as they meet my own. \u201cDad\u2019s not coming,\u201d he states bluntly and turns to walk away from me again. </p><p>\u201cHow can you assume that?\u201d I say, going after him. </p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d He yells and turns back around. I come to a complete stop; shocked at his sudden outburst, which I\u2019m sure he can tell by the look on my face. He lets out a breath, and his features soften as he runs a hand through his shaggy hair. \u201cEm, think about it. Dad was in another <i>country</i> recording a new album, it\u2019d be a miracle if he still managed to make it here on time to see us walk across that stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he promised,\u201d I whisper, not wanting to believe the facts. </p><p>\u201cPromises get broken,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd they seem to get broken a bit more often when your dad is Harry Styles.\u201d </p><p>He turns to walk away again, and this time I let him. I stand there absolutely speechless, and feel as if my heart is being weighed down. I take a deep breath, knowing I have to act like this doesn&rsquo;t bug me; but it\u2019s hard when I see everyone else with their dad\u2019s. However, Harry Styles\u2019 daughter can\u2019t be seen upset at her high school graduation. We don\u2019t need to be seeing my crying face plastered all over gossip sites tomorrow, so I\u2019ll pretend like I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I take one last breath and go to make my way to the auditorium, but stop as a hand places itself on my shoulder. I whip around and am met by the familiar smile of none other than Nick Grimshaw.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nick!\u201d I exclaim as he pulls me into a hug.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d He scoffs and pulls away to scowl at me.\u00a0\u201cNow what kind of Godfather would I be if I didn&rsquo;t make it to my best mates kid\u2019s high school graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d I tell him jokingly, causing him to smile.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad your here, but-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you&rsquo;re bummed your dad isn&rsquo;t,\u201d he cuts me off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I was going to say, and how did you even know that?\u201d I ask incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to your dad this morning,\u201d he explains with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cAnnnnd I may or may not have eavesdropped on your\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s little conversation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d I say and roll my eyes sarcastically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy god you look like your mother when you do that,\u201d he states in awe.</p><p>\u201cWhen I give attitude?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he confirms.\u00a0\u201cSame looks, same attitude; well maybe not the exact same.\u00a0I\u2019ve always said how Darcy is like your dad, Ethan is like your mum, but you\u2019re so much like both of them it\u2019s scary. Your Aunt Gemma can back me up on this theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh thanks&hellip; I guess,\u201d I start.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m assuming\u00a0you meant that as a compliment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he scoffs again.\u00a0\u201cBut Em, I need you to use that to help keep a clear mind about whatever happens today. Your mum gets tunnel visioned sometimes; focusing on one thing so much that it can become destructive if said thing is a negative. That same type of thing is happening to Ethan right now. You know your dad want\u2019s nothing more than to be here with his family, but life sucks sometimes and gets in the way. I think, if you help Ethan think about it that way, it\u2019ll make you both feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019ll try,\u201d I tell him with a smile. \u201cBut I should really go get my cap and gown, the ceremony is going to start soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I\u2019ll let you get to it then,\u201d he says and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cNow where do I go for this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut those doors and head to the right,\u201d I explain with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the football field and the stage, that\u2019s where it\u2019ll be. I think they\u2019re seating families in the bleachers, so you should be able to find everyone. Mum, Grandma Anne, Aunt Gemma, and Darcy are all out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, some of my favourite people to cheer on my favourite twins with.\u201d He says and starts walking away. \u201cGo knock em dead, kid.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself as I watch him disappear outside the doors, and finally head to the auditorium to grab my cap and gown. </p><p>Once I\u2019m in my full graduation outfit, all the graduates form a line in alphabetical order and we make our way towards the field. Ethan takes his spot directly behind me in line without saying a single word, and I can\u2019t help but inwardly groan to myself&hellip; This is going to be one long ceremony.  </p><p>The graduation progresses and I find myself continuously sneaking glances into the crowd or people every couple of minutes. It didn\u2019t take me long to find where my family is seated, and they keep sending me small smiles every time I look and see dad still isn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cS\u2019that Uncle Nick sitting between Mum and Darce?\u201d Ethan asks as he leans towards me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him quietly.\u00a0\u201cI was talking to him after you left me in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says and sits up straight again.\u00a0\u201cAnd still no dad.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and take a breath before glancing over at him.\u00a0\u201cEth, dad not being here isn\u2019t his intention. You don&rsquo;t have to tell me how much it sucks that he may not make it, because I already know; but that doesn&rsquo;t make him a bad dad. We have the best dad in the world, but he isn&rsquo;t perfect. You know how demanding his job is, and you know how badly he wanted to be here to cheer us on. We can&rsquo;t be mad at him for this.\u201d</p><p>He continues to look at me for a moment and slowly looks away. \u201cI know,\u201d he barely whispers.\u00a0\u201cI just miss him, y\u2019know? And I just remember how happy and proud he was at Darcy\u2019s graduation, I want him to feel the same for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too,\u201d I explain.\u00a0\u201cBut regardless of what happens today, I <i>know</i> that he\u2019s proud of us. I also know how bad he\u2019s going to feel about not being here, so we can at least be understanding and nice about it. It really isn&rsquo;t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreat people with kindness, yeah?\u201d He says with a smirk, and nudges my arm with his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I tell him with a wink. Before he can say anything else, our principle, Mrs. Neal asks the graduates to stand up row by row so we can receive our diplomas. With our last name beginning with an S, Ethan and I stay seated for a little bit; but soon our row is standing and we\u2019re\u00a0making our way to the right side of the stage.\u00a0</p><p>As the amount of people standing in front of me waiting for their name to be called shrinks, the butterflies in my stomach grow. As I impatiently wait, I look at the crowd of people\u00a0I&rsquo;ve spent the last four years with; and reminisce.\u00a0</p><p>In the first couple of rows, I can see my two best friends Nat and Alyssa. Each are seated on opposite sides of the aisle that separates the group of graduates. They smile and wave frantically with their diplomas in hand; excited for us all to finally be done, as well as for the party with all of our families that will take place at my house after the ceremony.\u00a0</p><p>A couple of rows behind Alyssa sits Nathan, my ex. We broke up shortly after Thanksgiving, and it was rough. After a year together we began fighting constantly, bringing each other down opposed to being supportive. Back in the fall I had decided to apply to schools out of state, which he didn&rsquo;t like very much. Our relationship became toxic, and after a couple talks with my friends and family; I realized that maybe he wasn&rsquo;t the person I was meant to be with. We remained civil after the break-up; so as our eyes meet and he sends me a small smile, I return it.</p><p>A few seats to his right sits Isaac, my other best friend and partner in crime. Having been inseparable for the majority of our high school years, he is overly excited for me to walk across the stage; just as I was for him moments ago. He sends me a subtle thumbs up, trying to be cool and I can\u2019t help but let out a laugh. I shake my head at him and move my gaze to the tiny UCL pin he\u2019s wearing on his robe, identical the one I am wearing as well to honour the school we will be attending together in the fall. I smile to myself as I look away, and think about all the adventures we\u2019ll have in the city I was born in, and love so dearly.\u00a0</p><p>I move to the bottom of the steps as the person in front of me has their name called. My eyes glance to my family, who are all smiling proudly. Mum is already crying along with Grandma Anne as they hold onto each other, while Aunt Gemma and Uncle Nick have their phones ready, and Darcy just shakes her head at the four of them. My sister looks to me and Ethan with a large smile, but before I can return it; my name is called.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles,\u201d Mrs. Neal announces and my eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo Em, you got this,\u201d Ethan says and pushes me slightly as people being to cheer. I nod my head and take a deep breath before finally going up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMiss Styles will be attending University College London this fall for journalism,\u201d \u00a0Mrs. Neal continues as I walk across the stage. I finally reach her in the centre, and shake her hand as she hands me my diploma.\u00a0\u201cCongratulations dear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I smile and go to mutter a thanks but am cut off by a distinct yelling over the rest of the cheering crowd.\u00a0\u201cWOOOOO THAT\u2019S MY GIRL!\u201d The voice calls out and I immediately look to my family. The five of them are all smiling with tears in their eyes, and are looking to the other side of the stage. My gaze follows theirs and soon meets the source of the noise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I whisper happily as tears begin pricking my eyes. I nod to my principle and make my way to the other side of the stage, to wait at the bottom of the stairs.

            "comment": "<p><h1>Too Long, Too Late</h1><p>Emma\u2019s POV (again. maybe one day I\u2019ll write from a different kid\u2019s POV, but today is not that day)</p><p>This is it. The one thing I\u2019ve been looking forward to since the first day I spent in this hell hole; my high school graduation. </p><p>I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s really not <i>that</i> big of a deal and all, but then I\u2019d be lying. This has been the only thing I\u2019ve been talking about for the last nine months, and now that it\u2019s finally here I can barely contain my excitement. </p><p>I\u2019m currently standing at the large entrance of my school watching the crowds of proud and excited families be greeted by their graduate, and get directed towards the football field where the ceremony is to be held. I glance down at my outfit, and smooth out the wrinkles that have formed on the white floral dress I\u2019m wearing; letting out a sigh. My long brown hair is still in it\u2019s neat curls mum did for me this morning, and I haven\u2019t cried yet so I know my makeup is ok too. </p><p>The heels I\u2019m wearing give me enough height to get a good look at the crowd, but I can\u2019t help the frown that forms when I still can\u2019t see them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be here Em,\u201d a voice speaks up from behind me and I instantly know it\u2019s my brother. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say and turn to face him. \u201cThey\u2019re probably on their way from the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell actually it looks like they\u2019re here now,\u201d my twin says and points behind me. I turn around and a wide smile stretches across my mouth as I see everyone. </p><p>Mum, Darcy, Grandma Anne, and Aunt Gemma are all making their way up the steps towards us; all smiling widely. I hug all of them and start looking around behind them, in search of the obvious missing person from the group. \u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent and looks away from me, except for Darcy. She looks around at the other three, and shakes her head disapprovingly when they don\u2019t say anything. \u201cOk, I guess I\u2019ll be the one to tell them,\u201d my older sister says before sending Ethan and I a sympathetic glance.\u00a0\u201cDad\u2019s flight got delayed. He thinks he can still make it in time, but just won\u2019t be here for the first half of the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>My heart instantly plummets into my stomach, and I know tears are beginning to show in my eyes. Dad has been away for well over a month now working on a new album; which is amazing, and I can\u2019t be mad about that. But, the day he left I was worried he wasn\u2019t going to make it back for our graduation and told him\u2026 He promised me otherwise, yet here we are.</p><p>Ethan looks down at the ground and lets out a breath.\u00a0\u201cIf you follow the crowd you\u2019ll find where everyone is being seated,\u201d he starts and takes a couple steps back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my gown and cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlick,\u201d Mum says and steps after him but he just turns around and walks though the doors. She looks absolutely defeated watching him leave, so she turns to look at me desperately.\u00a0\u201cSquirt, your dad is going to make-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going to go after him,\u201d I cut her off and take a step away. I turn my back to my family and start running after my twin, not looking back. I push through the large doors of the school to find him walking towards the auditorium with his back to me, so I try to get his attention. \u201cEthan, wait!\u201d</p><p>He comes to a stop and slowly turns around to face me, crossing his arms as he does so. I reach him and can see the iciness that glosses his green eyes, as soon as they meet my own. \u201cDad\u2019s not coming,\u201d he states bluntly and turns to walk away from me again. </p><p>\u201cHow can you assume that?\u201d I say, going after him. </p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d He yells and turns back around. I come to a complete stop; shocked at his sudden outburst, which I\u2019m sure he can tell by the look on my face. He lets out a breath, and his features soften as he runs a hand through his shaggy hair. \u201cEm, think about it. Dad was in another <i>country</i> recording a new album, it\u2019d be a miracle if he still managed to make it here on time to see us walk across that stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he promised,\u201d I whisper, not wanting to believe the facts. </p><p>\u201cPromises get broken,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd they seem to get broken a bit more often when your dad is Harry Styles.\u201d </p><p>He turns to walk away again, and this time I let him. I stand there absolutely speechless, and feel as if my heart is being weighed down. I take a deep breath, knowing I have to act like this doesn\u2019t bug me; but it\u2019s hard when I see everyone else with their dad\u2019s. However, Harry Styles\u2019 daughter can\u2019t be seen upset at her high school graduation. We don\u2019t need to be seeing my crying face plastered all over gossip sites tomorrow, so I\u2019ll pretend like I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I take one last breath and go to make my way to the auditorium, but stop as a hand places itself on my shoulder. I whip around and am met by the familiar smile of none other than Nick Grimshaw.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nick!\u201d I exclaim as he pulls me into a hug.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d He scoffs and pulls away to scowl at me.\u00a0\u201cNow what kind of Godfather would I be if I didn\u2019t make it to my best mates kid\u2019s high school graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d I tell him jokingly, causing him to smile.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad your here, but-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re bummed your dad isn\u2019t,\u201d he cuts me off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I was going to say, and how did you even know that?\u201d I ask incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to your dad this morning,\u201d he explains with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cAnnnnd I may or may not have eavesdropped on your\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s little conversation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d I say and roll my eyes sarcastically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy god you look like your mother when you do that,\u201d he states in awe.</p><p>\u201cWhen I give attitude?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he confirms.\u00a0\u201cSame looks, same attitude; well maybe not the exact same.\u00a0I\u2019ve always said how Darcy is like your dad, Ethan is like your mum, but you\u2019re so much like both of them it\u2019s scary. Your Aunt Gemma can back me up on this theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh thanks\u2026 I guess,\u201d I start.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m assuming\u00a0you meant that as a compliment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he scoffs again.\u00a0\u201cBut Em, I need you to use that to help keep a clear mind about whatever happens today. Your mum gets tunnel visioned sometimes; focusing on one thing so much that it can become destructive if said thing is a negative. That same type of thing is happening to Ethan right now. You know your dad want\u2019s nothing more than to be here with his family, but life sucks sometimes and gets in the way. I think, if you help Ethan think about it that way, it\u2019ll make you both feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019ll try,\u201d I tell him with a smile. \u201cBut I should really go get my cap and gown, the ceremony is going to start soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I\u2019ll let you get to it then,\u201d he says and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cNow where do I go for this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut those doors and head to the right,\u201d I explain with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the football field and the stage, that\u2019s where it\u2019ll be. I think they\u2019re seating families in the bleachers, so you should be able to find everyone. Mum, Grandma Anne, Aunt Gemma, and Darcy are all out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, some of my favourite people to cheer on my favourite twins with.\u201d He says and starts walking away. \u201cGo knock em dead, kid.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself as I watch him disappear outside the doors, and finally head to the auditorium to grab my cap and gown. </p><p>Once I\u2019m in my full graduation outfit, all the graduates form a line in alphabetical order and we make our way towards the field. Ethan takes his spot directly behind me in line without saying a single word, and I can\u2019t help but inwardly groan to myself\u2026 This is going to be one long ceremony.  </p><p>The graduation progresses and I find myself continuously sneaking glances into the crowd or people every couple of minutes. It didn\u2019t take me long to find where my family is seated, and they keep sending me small smiles every time I look and see dad still isn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cS\u2019that Uncle Nick sitting between Mum and Darce?\u201d Ethan asks as he leans towards me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him quietly.\u00a0\u201cI was talking to him after you left me in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says and sits up straight again.\u00a0\u201cAnd still no dad.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and take a breath before glancing over at him.\u00a0\u201cEth, dad not being here isn\u2019t his intention. You don\u2019t have to tell me how much it sucks that he may not make it, because I already know; but that doesn\u2019t make him a bad dad. We have the best dad in the world, but he isn\u2019t perfect. You know how demanding his job is, and you know how badly he wanted to be here to cheer us on. We can\u2019t be mad at him for this.\u201d</p><p>He continues to look at me for a moment and slowly looks away. \u201cI know,\u201d he barely whispers.\u00a0\u201cI just miss him, y\u2019know? And I just remember how happy and proud he was at Darcy\u2019s graduation, I want him to feel the same for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too,\u201d I explain.\u00a0\u201cBut regardless of what happens today, I <i>know</i> that he\u2019s proud of us. I also know how bad he\u2019s going to feel about not being here, so we can at least be understanding and nice about it. It really isn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreat people with kindness, yeah?\u201d He says with a smirk, and nudges my arm with his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I tell him with a wink. Before he can say anything else, our principle, Mrs. Neal asks the graduates to stand up row by row so we can receive our diplomas. With our last name beginning with an S, Ethan and I stay seated for a little bit; but soon our row is standing and we\u2019re\u00a0making our way to the right side of the stage.\u00a0</p><p>As the amount of people standing in front of me waiting for their name to be called shrinks, the butterflies in my stomach grow. As I impatiently wait, I look at the crowd of people\u00a0I\u2019ve spent the last four years with; and reminisce.\u00a0</p><p>In the first couple of rows, I can see my two best friends Nat and Alyssa. Each are seated on opposite sides of the aisle that separates the group of graduates. They smile and wave frantically with their diplomas in hand; excited for us all to finally be done, as well as for the party with all of our families that will take place at my house after the ceremony.\u00a0</p><p>A couple of rows behind Alyssa sits Nathan, my ex. We broke up shortly after Thanksgiving, and it was rough. After a year together we began fighting constantly, bringing each other down opposed to being supportive. Back in the fall I had decided to apply to schools out of state, which he didn\u2019t like very much. Our relationship became toxic, and after a couple talks with my friends and family; I realized that maybe he wasn\u2019t the person I was meant to be with. We remained civil after the break-up; so as our eyes meet and he sends me a small smile, I return it.</p><p>A few seats to his right sits Isaac, my other best friend and partner in crime. Having been inseparable for the majority of our high school years, he is overly excited for me to walk across the stage; just as I was for him moments ago. He sends me a subtle thumbs up, trying to be cool and I can\u2019t help but let out a laugh. I shake my head at him and move my gaze to the tiny UCL pin he\u2019s wearing on his robe, identical the one I am wearing as well to honour the school we will be attending together in the fall. I smile to myself as I look away, and think about all the adventures we\u2019ll have in the city I was born in, and love so dearly.\u00a0</p><p>I move to the bottom of the steps as the person in front of me has their name called. My eyes glance to my family, who are all smiling proudly. Mum is already crying along with Grandma Anne as they hold onto each other, while Aunt Gemma and Uncle Nick have their phones ready, and Darcy just shakes her head at the four of them. My sister looks to me and Ethan with a large smile, but before I can return it; my name is called.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles,\u201d Mrs. Neal announces and my eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo Em, you got this,\u201d Ethan says and pushes me slightly as people being to cheer. I nod my head and take a deep breath before finally going up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMiss Styles will be attending University College London this fall for journalism,\u201d \u00a0Mrs. Neal continues as I walk across the stage. I finally reach her in the centre, and shake her hand as she hands me my diploma.\u00a0\u201cCongratulations dear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I smile and go to mutter a thanks but am cut off by a distinct yelling over the rest of the cheering crowd.\u00a0\u201cWOOOOO THAT\u2019S MY GIRL!\u201d The voice calls out and I immediately look to my family. The five of them are all smiling with tears in their eyes, and are looking to the other side of the stage. My gaze follows theirs and soon meets the source of the noise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I whisper happily as tears begin pricking my eyes. I nod to my principle and make my way to the other side of the stage, to wait at the bottom of the stairs. I look at dad and he flashes me his famous smile, causing me to let out a sob (disguised as a laugh.) I want nothing more than to run over to him, but I wait as my final best friend is called onto the stage.</p><p>\u201cEthan Leon Styles,\u201d Mrs. Neal announces and cheers erupt once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY BOY,\u201d dad\u00a0yells loudly. I look up to see the rest of my family cheering, and I join in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Styles will be attending Imperial College in London this fall to study biochemistry, only a short drive across the city from his twin sister and other family members,\u201d our principle continues. Ethan receives his diploma with a wide smile, and makes his way towards me on the other side.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s down the steps, we pull each other into a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cCongratulations,\u201d we say to each other in unison, and laugh at our typical twin interaction.\u00a0</p><p>We pull away from each other, and look over at our beaming father. A smirk forms on my mouth as I glance at Ethan sideways, and he just nods before we both break into a sprint towards our dad.\u00a0</p><p>He welcomes us with open arms as we tackle him with hugs and laughs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you two. And I\u2019m sorry I was so late,\u201d he manages to get out between our laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter dad,\u201d Ethan says as dad ruffles his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now,\u201d I tell him and he places a kiss on top of my head.</p><p>Dad just smiles widely at the two of us as we pull away, and he places his arms around our shoulders as we stand on either of his sides. He looks up to at the rest of our family and blows them a kiss, as the three of us stand there for the remainder of the ceremony.</p><p>Once the ceremony is concluded, Ethan and I join the rest of our class in cheering and tossing our caps into the sky. Dad, Ethan, and I stay where we are as the crowd begins to disperse, waiting for the rest of our family to join.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d I ask my dad.\u00a0\u201cDid Aunt Clare, Uncle Adam, Uncle Mitch, Aunt Sarah, and Uncle Jeff stay wherever you just flew back from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replies with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all waiting at the house, bub. Wanted to say congrats in person. You\u2019re Uncle Leo and Uncle Jason are also there.\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, a screech sounds and I see everyone else approaching us.\u00a0\u201cMy babies just graduated high school,\u201d mum sobs as Ethan and I walk over and hug her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou two are going to do such amazing things,\u201d Grandam Anne says as we move to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy favourite twins are just getting so big,\u201d Aunt Gemma claims as she joins our group hug.\u00a0\u201cPlease stop growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh hey I\u2019m proud too,\u201d Grimmy says and wraps his arms around the group as well.</p><p>\u201cOh what the hell,\u201d Darcy says and joins in last. We all stay there for a minute as dad watches with nothing but love and appreciation for everyone in front of him. Darcy however, is the first to pull away and rush to our father for a hug.\u00a0\u201cHey dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Squish,\u201d he says and holds her tightly. \u201cI like the new hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I needed a change,\u201d she smiles and pulls away as Aunt Gemma and Grandma go in for a hug next. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019re you doing here ya bloke?\u201d Dad asks Uncle Nick as they greet each other excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t miss these two\u2019s graduation even though I wasn\u2019t <i>technically</i> invited,\u201d he explains and looks at me and Ethan pointedly.\u00a0\u201cAt least Darcy wanted me at her graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh get off it,\u201d Ethan says with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou know we would always want you here Grimmy.\u201d Everyone laughs agains until someone clears their throat, and catches our attention.

The one thing I\u2019ve been looking forward to since the first day I spent in this hell hole; my high school graduation. </p><p>I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s really not <i>that</i> big of a deal and all, but then I\u2019d be lying. This has been the only thing I\u2019ve been talking about for the last nine months, and now that it\u2019s finally here I can barely contain my excitement. </p><p>I\u2019m currently standing at the large entrance of my school watching the crowds of proud and excited families be greeted by their graduate, and get directed towards the football field where the ceremony is to be held. I glance down at my outfit, and smooth out the wrinkles that have formed on the white floral dress I\u2019m wearing; letting out a sigh. My long brown hair is still in it\u2019s neat curls mum did for me this morning, and I haven\u2019t cried yet so I know my makeup is ok too. </p><p>The heels I\u2019m wearing give me enough height to get a good look at the crowd, but I can\u2019t help the frown that forms when I still can\u2019t see them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be here Em,\u201d a voice speaks up from behind me and I instantly know it\u2019s my brother. </p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say and turn to face him. \u201cThey\u2019re probably on their way from the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell actually it looks like they\u2019re here now,\u201d my twin says and points behind me. I turn around and a wide smile stretches across my mouth as I see everyone. </p><p>Mum, Darcy, Grandma Anne, and Aunt Gemma are all making their way up the steps towards us; all smiling widely. I hug all of them and start looking around behind them, in search of the obvious missing person from the group. \u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>Everyone falls silent and looks away from me, except for Darcy. She looks around at the other three, and shakes her head disapprovingly when they don\u2019t say anything. \u201cOk, I guess I\u2019ll be the one to tell them,\u201d my older sister says before sending Ethan and I a sympathetic glance.\u00a0\u201cDad\u2019s flight got delayed. He thinks he can still make it in time, but just won\u2019t be here for the first half of the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>My heart instantly plummets into my stomach, and I know tears are beginning to show in my eyes. Dad has been away for well over a month now working on a new album; which is amazing, and I can\u2019t be mad about that. But, the day he left I was worried he wasn\u2019t going to make it back for our graduation and told him\u2026 He promised me otherwise, yet here we are.</p><p>Ethan looks down at the ground and lets out a breath.\u00a0\u201cIf you follow the crowd you\u2019ll find where everyone is being seated,\u201d he starts and takes a couple steps back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get my gown and cap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlick,\u201d Mum says and steps after him but he just turns around and walks though the doors. She looks absolutely defeated watching him leave, so she turns to look at me desperately.\u00a0\u201cSquirt, your dad is going to make-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m going to go after him,\u201d I cut her off and take a step away. I turn my back to my family and start running after my twin, not looking back. I push through the large doors of the school to find him walking towards the auditorium with his back to me, so I try to get his attention. \u201cEthan, wait!\u201d</p><p>He comes to a stop and slowly turns around to face me, crossing his arms as he does so. I reach him and can see the iciness that glosses his green eyes, as soon as they meet my own. \u201cDad\u2019s not coming,\u201d he states bluntly and turns to walk away from me again. </p><p>\u201cHow can you assume that?\u201d I say, going after him. </p><p>\u201cHow can you not?\u201d He yells and turns back around. I come to a complete stop; shocked at his sudden outburst, which I\u2019m sure he can tell by the look on my face. He lets out a breath, and his features soften as he runs a hand through his shaggy hair. \u201cEm, think about it. Dad was in another <i>country</i> recording a new album, it\u2019d be a miracle if he still managed to make it here on time to see us walk across that stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he promised,\u201d I whisper, not wanting to believe the facts. </p><p>\u201cPromises get broken,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd they seem to get broken a bit more often when your dad is Harry Styles.\u201d </p><p>He turns to walk away again, and this time I let him. I stand there absolutely speechless, and feel as if my heart is being weighed down. I take a deep breath, knowing I have to act like this doesn\u2019t bug me; but it\u2019s hard when I see everyone else with their dad\u2019s. However, Harry Styles\u2019 daughter can\u2019t be seen upset at her high school graduation. We don\u2019t need to be seeing my crying face plastered all over gossip sites tomorrow, so I\u2019ll pretend like I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I take one last breath and go to make my way to the auditorium, but stop as a hand places itself on my shoulder. I whip around and am met by the familiar smile of none other than Nick Grimshaw.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nick!\u201d I exclaim as he pulls me into a hug.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d He scoffs and pulls away to scowl at me.\u00a0\u201cNow what kind of Godfather would I be if I didn\u2019t make it to my best mates kid\u2019s high school graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst kind,\u201d I tell him jokingly, causing him to smile.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m glad your here, but-.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re bummed your dad isn\u2019t,\u201d he cuts me off.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cS\u2019not what I was going to say, and how did you even know that?\u201d I ask incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to your dad this morning,\u201d he explains with a shrug.\u00a0\u201cAnnnnd I may or may not have eavesdropped on your\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s little conversation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d I say and roll my eyes sarcastically.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy god you look like your mother when you do that,\u201d he states in awe.</p><p>\u201cWhen I give attitude?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he confirms.\u00a0\u201cSame looks, same attitude; well maybe not the exact same.\u00a0I\u2019ve always said how Darcy is like your dad, Ethan is like your mum, but you\u2019re so much like both of them it\u2019s scary. Your Aunt Gemma can back me up on this theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh thanks\u2026 I guess,\u201d I start.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m assuming\u00a0you meant that as a compliment, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d he scoffs again.\u00a0\u201cBut Em, I need you to use that to help keep a clear mind about whatever happens today. Your mum gets tunnel visioned sometimes; focusing on one thing so much that it can become destructive if said thing is a negative. That same type of thing is happening to Ethan right now. You know your dad want\u2019s nothing more than to be here with his family, but life sucks sometimes and gets in the way. I think, if you help Ethan think about it that way, it\u2019ll make you both feel a lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk I\u2019ll try,\u201d I tell him with a smile. \u201cBut I should really go get my cap and gown, the ceremony is going to start soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I\u2019ll let you get to it then,\u201d he says and pats me on the shoulder. \u201cNow where do I go for this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut those doors and head to the right,\u201d I explain with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the football field and the stage, that\u2019s where it\u2019ll be. I think they\u2019re seating families in the bleachers, so you should be able to find everyone. Mum, Grandma Anne, Aunt Gemma, and Darcy are all out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, some of my favourite people to cheer on my favourite twins with.\u201d He says and starts walking away. \u201cGo knock em dead, kid.\u201d</p><p>I smile to myself as I watch him disappear outside the doors, and finally head to the auditorium to grab my cap and gown. </p><p>Once I\u2019m in my full graduation outfit, all the graduates form a line in alphabetical order and we make our way towards the field. Ethan takes his spot directly behind me in line without saying a single word, and I can\u2019t help but inwardly groan to myself\u2026 This is going to be one long ceremony.  </p><p>The graduation progresses and I find myself continuously sneaking glances into the crowd or people every couple of minutes. It didn\u2019t take me long to find where my family is seated, and they keep sending me small smiles every time I look and see dad still isn\u2019t there. </p><p>\u201cS\u2019that Uncle Nick sitting between Mum and Darce?\u201d Ethan asks as he leans towards me.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him quietly.\u00a0\u201cI was talking to him after you left me in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says and sits up straight again.\u00a0\u201cAnd still no dad.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and take a breath before glancing over at him.\u00a0\u201cEth, dad not being here isn\u2019t his intention. You don\u2019t have to tell me how much it sucks that he may not make it, because I already know; but that doesn\u2019t make him a bad dad. We have the best dad in the world, but he isn\u2019t perfect. You know how demanding his job is, and you know how badly he wanted to be here to cheer us on. We can\u2019t be mad at him for this.\u201d</p><p>He continues to look at me for a moment and slowly looks away. \u201cI know,\u201d he barely whispers.\u00a0\u201cI just miss him, y\u2019know? And I just remember how happy and proud he was at Darcy\u2019s graduation, I want him to feel the same for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him too,\u201d I explain.\u00a0\u201cBut regardless of what happens today, I <i>know</i> that he\u2019s proud of us. I also know how bad he\u2019s going to feel about not being here, so we can at least be understanding and nice about it. It really isn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreat people with kindness, yeah?\u201d He says with a smirk, and nudges my arm with his.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I tell him with a wink. Before he can say anything else, our principle, Mrs. Neal asks the graduates to stand up row by row so we can receive our diplomas. With our last name beginning with an S, Ethan and I stay seated for a little bit; but soon our row is standing and we\u2019re\u00a0making our way to the right side of the stage.\u00a0</p><p>As the amount of people standing in front of me waiting for their name to be called shrinks, the butterflies in my stomach grow. As I impatiently wait, I look at the crowd of people\u00a0I\u2019ve spent the last four years with; and reminisce.\u00a0</p><p>In the first couple of rows, I can see my two best friends Nat and Alyssa. Each are seated on opposite sides of the aisle that separates the group of graduates. They smile and wave frantically with their diplomas in hand; excited for us all to finally be done, as well as for the party with all of our families that will take place at my house after the ceremony.\u00a0</p><p>A couple of rows behind Alyssa sits Nathan, my ex. We broke up shortly after Thanksgiving, and it was rough. After a year together we began fighting constantly, bringing each other down opposed to being supportive. Back in the fall I had decided to apply to schools out of state, which he didn\u2019t like very much. Our relationship became toxic, and after a couple talks with my friends and family; I realized that maybe he wasn\u2019t the person I was meant to be with. We remained civil after the break-up; so as our eyes meet and he sends me a small smile, I return it.</p><p>A few seats to his right sits Isaac, my other best friend and partner in crime. Having been inseparable for the majority of our high school years, he is overly excited for me to walk across the stage; just as I was for him moments ago. He sends me a subtle thumbs up, trying to be cool and I can\u2019t help but let out a laugh. I shake my head at him and move my gaze to the tiny UCL pin he\u2019s wearing on his robe, identical the one I am wearing as well to honour the school we will be attending together in the fall. I smile to myself as I look away, and think about all the adventures we\u2019ll have in the city I was born in, and love so dearly.\u00a0</p><p>I move to the bottom of the steps as the person in front of me has their name called. My eyes glance to my family, who are all smiling proudly. Mum is already crying along with Grandma Anne as they hold onto each other, while Aunt Gemma and Uncle Nick have their phones ready, and Darcy just shakes her head at the four of them. My sister looks to me and Ethan with a large smile, but before I can return it; my name is called.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEmma Anne Styles,\u201d Mrs. Neal announces and my eyes go wide.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo Em, you got this,\u201d Ethan says and pushes me slightly as people being to cheer. I nod my head and take a deep breath before finally going up the stairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMiss Styles will be attending University College London this fall for journalism,\u201d \u00a0Mrs. Neal continues as I walk across the stage. I finally reach her in the centre, and shake her hand as she hands me my diploma.\u00a0\u201cCongratulations dear.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>I smile and go to mutter a thanks but am cut off by a distinct yelling over the rest of the cheering crowd.\u00a0\u201cWOOOOO THAT\u2019S MY GIRL!\u201d The voice calls out and I immediately look to my family. The five of them are all smiling with tears in their eyes, and are looking to the other side of the stage. My gaze follows theirs and soon meets the source of the noise.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I whisper happily as tears begin pricking my eyes. I nod to my principle and make my way to the other side of the stage, to wait at the bottom of the stairs. I look at dad and he flashes me his famous smile, causing me to let out a sob (disguised as a laugh.) I want nothing more than to run over to him, but I wait as my final best friend is called onto the stage.</p><p>\u201cEthan Leon Styles,\u201d Mrs. Neal announces and cheers erupt once again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTHAT\u2019S MY BOY,\u201d dad\u00a0yells loudly. I look up to see the rest of my family cheering, and I join in.</p><p>\u201cMr. Styles will be attending Imperial College in London this fall to study biochemistry, only a short drive across the city from his twin sister and other family members,\u201d our principle continues. Ethan receives his diploma with a wide smile, and makes his way towards me on the other side.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019s down the steps, we pull each other into a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cCongratulations,\u201d we say to each other in unison, and laugh at our typical twin interaction.\u00a0</p><p>We pull away from each other, and look over at our beaming father. A smirk forms on my mouth as I glance at Ethan sideways, and he just nods before we both break into a sprint towards our dad.\u00a0</p><p>He welcomes us with open arms as we tackle him with hugs and laughs.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you two. And I\u2019m sorry I was so late,\u201d he manages to get out between our laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter dad,\u201d Ethan says as dad ruffles his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now,\u201d I tell him and he places a kiss on top of my head.</p><p>Dad just smiles widely at the two of us as we pull away, and he places his arms around our shoulders as we stand on either of his sides. He looks up to at the rest of our family and blows them a kiss, as the three of us stand there for the remainder of the ceremony.</p><p>Once the ceremony is concluded, Ethan and I join the rest of our class in cheering and tossing our caps into the sky. Dad, Ethan, and I stay where we are as the crowd begins to disperse, waiting for the rest of our family to join.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d I ask my dad.\u00a0\u201cDid Aunt Clare, Uncle Adam, Uncle Mitch, Aunt Sarah, and Uncle Jeff stay wherever you just flew back from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replies with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re all waiting at the house, bub. Wanted to say congrats in person. You\u2019re Uncle Leo and Uncle Jason are also there.\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, a screech sounds and I see everyone else approaching us.\u00a0\u201cMy babies just graduated high school,\u201d mum sobs as Ethan and I walk over and hug her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou two are going to do such amazing things,\u201d Grandam Anne says as we move to her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMy favourite twins are just getting so big,\u201d Aunt Gemma claims as she joins our group hug.\u00a0\u201cPlease stop growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh hey I\u2019m proud too,\u201d Grimmy says and wraps his arms around the group as well.</p><p>\u201cOh what the hell,\u201d Darcy says and joins in last. We all stay there for a minute as dad watches with nothing but love and appreciation for everyone in front of him. Darcy however, is the first to pull away and rush to our father for a hug.\u00a0\u201cHey dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Squish,\u201d he says and holds her tightly. \u201cI like the new hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I needed a change,\u201d she smiles and pulls away as Aunt Gemma and Grandma go in for a hug next. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019re you doing here ya bloke?\u201d Dad asks Uncle Nick as they greet each other excitedly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t miss these two\u2019s graduation even though I wasn\u2019t <i>technically</i> invited,\u201d he explains and looks at me and Ethan pointedly.\u00a0\u201cAt least Darcy wanted me at her graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh get off it,\u201d Ethan says with a laugh.\u00a0\u201cYou know we would always want you here Grimmy.\u201d Everyone laughs agains until someone clears their throat, and catches our attention. We all look at the source and split apart so the person has room to walk by.</p><p>\u201cI think you forgot to say hello to someone,\u201d mum says as she takes a step towards dad.</p><p>\u201cMmm I could never,\u201d he states with a smirk. Mum smiles as tears noticeably fill her eyes, and dad reaches his hand out to grab hers. He pulls her in for a kiss and a tight embrace, as we all watch with smiles on our faces.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEw get a room,\u201d Ethan says jokingly as Darcy and I swat his arm for ruining the moment.\u00a0</p><p>Everyone laughs and shakes their heads at my twin, who holds his arm in pain. \u201cWhat do you say we get out of here, and get the real party started now, huh?\u201d Mum speaks up and everyone cheers.</p><p>We all make our way away from the school, and I look back at it and smile. I came to this place unsure of what the future was going to hold, and am leaving it with a sense of direction and a full heart. There couldn\u2019t have been a better way to end this chapter of my life than the way it played out, and I am excited for what is to come next.</p></p>",

She looks absolutely defeated watching him leave, so she turns to look at me desperately.&nbsp;&ldquo;Squirt, your dad is going to make-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m going to go after him,&rdquo; I cut her off and take a step away. I turn my back to my family and start running after my twin, not looking back. I push through the large doors of the school to find him walking towards the auditorium with his back to me, so I try to get his attention. &ldquo;Ethan, wait!&rdquo;</p><p>He comes to a stop and slowly turns around to face me, crossing his arms as he does so. I reach him and can see the iciness that glosses his green eyes, as soon as they meet my own. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s not coming,&rdquo; he states bluntly and turns to walk away from me again. </p><p>&ldquo;How can you assume that?&rdquo; I say, going after him. </p><p>&ldquo;How can you not?&rdquo; He yells and turns back around. I come to a complete stop; shocked at his sudden outburst, which I&rsquo;m sure he can tell by the look on my face. He lets out a breath, and his features soften as he runs a hand through his shaggy hair. &ldquo;Em, think about it. Dad was in another <i>country</i> recording a new album, it&rsquo;d be a miracle if he still managed to make it here on time to see us walk across that stage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he promised,&rdquo; I whisper, not wanting to believe the facts. </p><p>&ldquo;Promises get broken,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;And they seem to get broken a bit more often when your dad is Harry Styles.&rdquo; </p><p>He turns to walk away again, and this time I let him. I stand there absolutely speechless, and feel as if my heart is being weighed down. I take a deep breath, knowing I have to act like this doesn&rsquo;t bug me; but it&rsquo;s hard when I see everyone else with their dad&rsquo;s. However, Harry Styles&rsquo; daughter can&rsquo;t be seen upset at her high school graduation. We don&rsquo;t need to be seeing my crying face plastered all over gossip sites tomorrow, so I&rsquo;ll pretend like I&rsquo;m fine.</p><p>I take one last breath and go to make my way to the auditorium, but stop as a hand places itself on my shoulder. I whip around and am met by the familiar smile of none other than Nick Grimshaw.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Nick!&rdquo; I exclaim as he pulls me into a hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I doing here?&rdquo; He scoffs and pulls away to scowl at me.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now what kind of Godfather would I be if I didn&rsquo;t make it to my best mates kid&rsquo;s high school graduation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The worst kind,&rdquo; I tell him jokingly, causing him to smile.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your here, but-.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re bummed your dad isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cuts me off.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;not what I was going to say, and how did you even know that?&rdquo; I ask incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;I was talking to your dad this morning,&rdquo; he explains with a shrug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Annnnd I may or may not have eavesdropped on your&rsquo;s and Ethan&rsquo;s little conversation there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; I say and roll my eyes sarcastically.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My god you look like your mother when you do that,&rdquo; he states in awe.</p><p>&ldquo;When I give attitude?&rdquo; I ask with a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he confirms.&nbsp;&ldquo;Same looks, same attitude; well maybe not the exact same.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always said how Darcy is like your dad, Ethan is like your mum, but you&rsquo;re so much like both of them it&rsquo;s scary. Your Aunt Gemma can back me up on this theory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh thanks&hellip; I guess,&rdquo; I start.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming&nbsp;you meant that as a compliment, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; he scoffs again.&nbsp;&ldquo;But Em, I need you to use that to help keep a clear mind about whatever happens today. Your mum gets tunnel visioned sometimes; focusing on one thing so much that it can become destructive if said thing is a negative. That same type of thing is happening to Ethan right now. You know your dad want&rsquo;s nothing more than to be here with his family, but life sucks sometimes and gets in the way. I think, if you help Ethan think about it that way, it&rsquo;ll make you both feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; I tell him with a smile. &ldquo;But I should really go get my cap and gown, the ceremony is going to start soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, I&rsquo;ll let you get to it then,&rdquo; he says and pats me on the shoulder. &ldquo;Now where do I go for this thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Out those doors and head to the right,&rdquo; I explain with a laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see the football field and the stage, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;ll be. I think they&rsquo;re seating families in the bleachers, so you should be able to find everyone. Mum, Grandma Anne, Aunt Gemma, and Darcy are all out there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect, some of my favourite people to cheer on my favourite twins with.&rdquo; He says and starts walking away. &ldquo;Go knock em dead, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>I smile to myself as I watch him disappear outside the doors, and finally head to the auditorium to grab my cap and gown. </p><p>Once I&rsquo;m in my full graduation outfit, all the graduates form a line in alphabetical order and we make our way towards the field. Ethan takes his spot directly behind me in line without saying a single word, and I can&rsquo;t help but inwardly groan to myself&hellip; This is going to be one long ceremony.  </p><p>The graduation progresses and I find myself continuously sneaking glances into the crowd or people every couple of minutes. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to find where my family is seated, and they keep sending me small smiles every time I look and see dad still isn&rsquo;t there. </p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;that Uncle Nick sitting between Mum and Darce?&rdquo; Ethan asks as he leans towards me.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I tell him quietly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was talking to him after you left me in the hallway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; he says and sits up straight again.&nbsp;&ldquo;And still no dad.&rdquo;</p><p>I shut my eyes and take a breath before glancing over at him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eth, dad not being here isn&rsquo;t his intention. You don&rsquo;t have to tell me how much it sucks that he may not make it, because I already know; but that doesn&rsquo;t make him a bad dad. We have the best dad in the world, but he isn&rsquo;t perfect. You know how demanding his job is, and you know how badly he wanted to be here to cheer us on. We can&rsquo;t be mad at him for this.&rdquo;</p><p>He continues to look at me for a moment and slowly looks away. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he barely whispers.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just miss him, y&rsquo;know? And I just remember how happy and proud he was at Darcy&rsquo;s graduation, I want him to feel the same for us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I miss him too,&rdquo; I explain.&nbsp;&ldquo;But regardless of what happens today, I <i>know</i> that he&rsquo;s proud of us. I also know how bad he&rsquo;s going to feel about not being here, so we can at least be understanding and nice about it. It really isn&rsquo;t his fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Treat people with kindness, yeah?&rdquo; He says with a smirk, and nudges my arm with his.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; I tell him with a wink. Before he can say anything else, our principle, Mrs. Neal asks the graduates to stand up row by row so we can receive our diplomas. With our last name beginning with an S, Ethan and I stay seated for a little bit; but soon our row is standing and we&rsquo;re&nbsp;making our way to the right side of the stage.&nbsp;</p><p>As the amount of people standing in front of me waiting for their name to be called shrinks, the butterflies in my stomach grow. As I impatiently wait, I look at the crowd of people&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve spent the last four years with; and reminisce.&nbsp;</p><p>In the first couple of rows, I can see my two best friends Nat and Alyssa. Each are seated on opposite sides of the aisle that separates the group of graduates. They smile and wave frantically with their diplomas in hand; excited for us all to finally be done, as well as for the party with all of our families that will take place at my house after the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of rows behind Alyssa sits Nathan, my ex. We broke up shortly after Thanksgiving, and it was rough. After a year together we began fighting constantly, bringing each other down opposed to being supportive. Back in the fall I had decided to apply to schools out of state, which he didn&rsquo;t like very much. Our relationship became toxic, and after a couple talks with my friends and family; I realized that maybe he wasn&rsquo;t the person I was meant to be with. We remained civil after the break-up; so as our eyes meet and he sends me a small smile, I return it.</p><p>A few seats to his right sits Isaac, my other best friend and partner in crime. Having been inseparable for the majority of our high school years, he is overly excited for me to walk across the stage; just as I was for him moments ago. He sends me a subtle thumbs up, trying to be cool and I can&rsquo;t help but let out a laugh. I shake my head at him and move my gaze to the tiny UCL pin he&rsquo;s wearing on his robe, identical the one I am wearing as well to honour the school we will be attending together in the fall. I smile to myself as I look away, and think about all the adventures we&rsquo;ll have in the city I was born in, and love so dearly.&nbsp;</p><p>I move to the bottom of the steps as the person in front of me has their name called. My eyes glance to my family, who are all smiling proudly. Mum is already crying along with Grandma Anne as they hold onto each other, while Aunt Gemma and Uncle Nick have their phones ready, and Darcy just shakes her head at the four of them. My sister looks to me and Ethan with a large smile, but before I can return it; my name is called.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Emma Anne Styles,&rdquo; Mrs. Neal announces and my eyes go wide.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go Em, you got this,&rdquo; Ethan says and pushes me slightly as people being to cheer. I nod my head and take a deep breath before finally going up the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Styles will be attending University College London this fall for journalism,&rdquo; &nbsp;Mrs. Neal continues as I walk across the stage. I finally reach her in the centre, and shake her hand as she hands me my diploma.&nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations dear.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>I smile and go to mutter a thanks but am cut off by a distinct yelling over the rest of the cheering crowd.&nbsp;&ldquo;WOOOOO THAT&rsquo;S MY GIRL!&rdquo; The voice calls out and I immediately look to my family. The five of them are all smiling with tears in their eyes, and are looking to the other side of the stage. My gaze follows theirs and soon meets the source of the noise.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; I whisper happily as tears begin pricking my eyes. I nod to my principle and make my way to the other side of the stage, to wait at the bottom of the stairs. I look at dad and he flashes me his famous smile, causing me to let out a sob (disguised as a laugh.) I want nothing more than to run over to him, but I wait as my final best friend is called onto the stage.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan Leon Styles,&rdquo; Mrs. Neal announces and cheers erupt once again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S MY BOY,&rdquo; dad&nbsp;yells loudly. I look up to see the rest of my family cheering, and I join in.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Styles will be attending Imperial College in London this fall to study biochemistry, only a short drive across the city from his twin sister and other family members,&rdquo; our principle continues. Ethan receives his diploma with a wide smile, and makes his way towards me on the other side.</p><p>As soon as he&rsquo;s down the steps, we pull each other into a tight hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; we say to each other in unison, and laugh at our typical twin interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>We pull away from each other, and look over at our beaming father. A smirk forms on my mouth as I glance at Ethan sideways, and he just nods before we both break into a sprint towards our dad.&nbsp;</p><p>He welcomes us with open arms as we tackle him with hugs and laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you two. And I&rsquo;m sorry I was so late,&rdquo; he manages to get out between our laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter dad,&rdquo; Ethan says as dad ruffles his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here now,&rdquo; I tell him and he places a kiss on top of my head.</p><p>Dad just smiles widely at the two of us as we pull away, and he places his arms around our shoulders as we stand on either of his sides. He looks up to at the rest of our family and blows them a kiss, as the three of us stand there for the remainder of the ceremony.</p><p>Once the ceremony is concluded, Ethan and I join the rest of our class in cheering and tossing our caps into the sky. Dad, Ethan, and I stay where we are as the crowd begins to disperse, waiting for the rest of our family to join.</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s everyone else?&rdquo; I ask my dad.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did Aunt Clare, Uncle Adam, Uncle Mitch, Aunt Sarah, and Uncle Jeff stay wherever you just flew back from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replies with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all waiting at the house, bub. Wanted to say congrats in person. You&rsquo;re Uncle Leo and Uncle Jason are also there.&rdquo;</p><p>Before I can respond, a screech sounds and I see everyone else approaching us.&nbsp;&ldquo;My babies just graduated high school,&rdquo; mum sobs as Ethan and I walk over and hug her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You two are going to do such amazing things,&rdquo; Grandam Anne says as we move to her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My favourite twins are just getting so big,&rdquo; Aunt Gemma claims as she joins our group hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Please stop growing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh hey I&rsquo;m proud too,&rdquo; Grimmy says and wraps his arms around the group as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh what the hell,&rdquo; Darcy says and joins in last. We all stay there for a minute as dad watches with nothing but love and appreciation for everyone in front of him. Darcy however, is the first to pull away and rush to our father for a hug.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey dad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Squish,&rdquo; he says and holds her tightly. &ldquo;I like the new hair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, I needed a change,&rdquo; she smiles and pulls away as Aunt Gemma and Grandma go in for a hug next. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;re you doing here ya bloke?&rdquo; Dad asks Uncle Nick as they greet each other excitedly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t miss these two&rsquo;s graduation even though I wasn&rsquo;t <i>technically</i> invited,&rdquo; he explains and looks at me and Ethan pointedly.&nbsp;&ldquo;At least Darcy wanted me at her graduation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh get off it,&rdquo; Ethan says with a laugh.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know we would always want you here Grimmy.&rdquo; Everyone laughs agains until someone clears their throat, and catches our attention. We all look at the source and split apart so the person has room to walk by.</p><p>&ldquo;I think you forgot to say hello to someone,&rdquo; mum says as she takes a step towards dad.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm I could never,&rdquo; he states with a smirk. Mum smiles as tears noticeably fill her eyes, and dad reaches his hand out to grab hers. He pulls her in for a kiss and a tight embrace, as we all watch with smiles on our faces.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ew get a room,&rdquo; Ethan says jokingly as Darcy and I swat his arm for ruining the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone laughs and shakes their heads at my twin, who holds his arm in pain. &ldquo;What do you say we get out of here, and get the real party started now, huh?&rdquo; Mum speaks up and everyone cheers.</p><p>We all make our way away from the school, and I look back at it and smile. I came to this place unsure of what the future was going to hold, and am leaving it with a sense of direction and a full heart. There couldn&rsquo;t have been a better way to end this chapter of my life than the way it played out, and I am excited for what is to come next.</p></p>",
