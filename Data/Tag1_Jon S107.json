Just because I don\u2019t support a theory or storyline is not a reason to attack.  Adult, civil discussion is always welcome. I am operating under the assumption that Friki\u2019s information is legit and that Tyrion will be a part of some kind of betrayal.</p><ul><li>Arya Stark - 90% survival rate - she fights until the end and will possibly help The Hound take out the Mountain - he is still on her list.  The only way I can see her dying is in some kind of surprise attack, but she is supposedly present in the DP according to Friki\u2019s info.  </li><li>Sansa Stark - 80% survival rate - i don\u2019t foresee her picking up a sword, but she will be instrumental in the battle of Winterfell in preparing the common folk, being ready to retreat with a certain signal, getting people out through the crypt tunnels, and exacting the retreat plans.  Beyond her getting people out safely and retreating south - The Vale, maybe, I can see her being important in the politics of things and possibly uncovering information about Tyrion\u2019s betrayal.  The only way I can see her dying is if Cersei gets hold of her or she falls during the WF battle.  Again - she is supposed to be present at the DP as well.</li><li>Bran - 90% survival rate - he will be instrumental in tracking the Night King\u2019s movements and will be fiercely protected.  He will also find out how to defeat the NK, whether that is how to forge Lightbringer (no Jon will not stab Dany), or something they have to do at the Altar of Winter, I don\u2019t know.  If he does fall, it will be as a sacrifice to the NK to save humanity - but he\u2019s supposedly present at the DP.</li><li>Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen) - 50/50 survival rate - he\u2019ll be in the thick of things until the end, but may fall trying to save his family.  I lean towards safe because he\u2019s carrying huge plot armor having died once already.  He\u2019s legendary status whether he lives or dies.  I am liking the theory of him giving himself up to Cersei and double crossing her with the Golden Company.  She thinks she\u2019s won, but they end up declaring for the Targs because they offer them back their lands and titles.  </li><li>Daenerys Targaryen - 50/50 survival rate - she has baby plot armor and I really can\u2019t see her dying in childbirth.  What a horrible ending for her.  It would be 100% bitter giving her a child and then she can never be a mother to him/her.  Not okay and I really don\u2019t see this happening as I believe that BoatSexBaby\u2019s info is correct in that the baby is endgame.  If she dies it will be post-birth by sacrificing herself to save the realm or to save Jon.  There\u2019s also a possibility that she is killed by someone she trusts or they attempt to kill her.  She will also hold Legendary status whether alive or dead. </li><li>Jon/Dany relationship - there will be some initial tumult, but they will stay together and fight together no matter what because they promised each other and they are people who take their oaths seriously.  I think the romance part will cool off some after the parent reveal as they stand in limbo with their relationship, but after the baby reveal, none of it will matter - they are the last Targaryens and it\u2019s no coincidence that they found each other and fell in love - it\u2019s a fate/destiny thing.  I know the incest freaks some people out, but this is not a 2019 modern setting.  It\u2019s meant to be like a medieval society and those types of relationships were typical to retain lands and grow houses.  So, if that bothers you - sorry, but it\u2019s not going to matter in the long run.

It will blow up in his face.  Some may think he was correct and the rest will think he deserves to die - this is what will fuck people up.</li><li>Jaime Lannister - 100% dead.

And if you really want to get technical, take a look into the British monarchy - loads and loads of incest and that&rsquo;s real life, folks.</li><li>Tyrion Lannister - i believe Friki&rsquo;s info to be true and with that assumption, Tyrion will 100% die.  The only question is if Dany or Jon will pass the sentence.  I think this is the big shock that is going to leave the fandom numb, shocked, and in need of therapy.  If Dany passes the sentence, which I think she will, that will further divide the fandom especially those who already see Dany in a negative light.  She&rsquo;s my fave, but she&rsquo;s not perfect.  I welcome civil discussion o that point, but won&rsquo;t tolerate blatant Dany hate (or any hate of a character really).  I believe his betrayal will stem from the want to protect Cersei&rsquo;s unborn child and he will set something in motion that rests on her having the baby - which we all know isn&rsquo;t happening.  It will blow up in his face.  Some may think he was correct and the rest will think he deserves to die - this is what will fuck people up.</li><li>Jaime Lannister - 100% dead.  He has to fulfill his redemption arc, so I think he will die saving either the Stark girls or Dany.  Sorry.  </li><li>Cersei Lannister - 100% dead - no question.  It&rsquo;s only how she dies that is a mystery.  I like the theory that she kills herself with poison so that nobody can have the satisfaction of killing her.  She&rsquo;s going out on her own terms.  She will fuck some shit up though.  She will not go quietly into the night. :) </li><li>Mountain &amp; Hound - dead</li><li>Brienne - 90% survival rate - she will mourn for Jaime, and no, I don&rsquo;t think they will hook up - they might admit their feelings, but I don&rsquo;t see that happening on screen - she will serve the Starks for the rest of her life.  If she does die, it will be protecting Arya or Sansa</li><li>Gendry - 100% survival - restores House Baratheon through legitimization.  Not sure if he and Arya will take things to the next level.</li><li>Pod - dead</li><li>Bronn - dead and likely complicit in Tyrion&rsquo;s betrayal somehow </li><li>Davos - 100% survival rate - I will have it no other way.  He&rsquo;s supposedly present at the DP.</li><li>Qyburn - dead</li><li>Robin Arryn - 100% alive - present at DP and probably won&rsquo;t see much more of him beyond a few scenes</li><li>Tormund - dead fighting the White Walkers</li><li>Beric - dead but not before resurrecting someone, maybe Dany or Arya - restitution for him selling Gendry to Mel</li><li>Melisandre - dead fighting the NK</li><li>Varys - dead - possibly part of the betrayal</li><li>Missandei - 100% lives - ride or die</li><li>Greyworm - 50/50 - alive because he&rsquo;s a badass mother fucker; dead because it&rsquo;s war and shit happens</li><li>Jorah - 100% dead - saving Dany or Jon </li><li>Ghost - 100% dead - don&rsquo;t even talk to me</li><li>Rheagal - 100% dead - for real, say nothing</li><li>Drogon - 50/50 - I will lose my shit</li><li>Jon and Dany&rsquo;s kid - 100% happening and surviving</li></ul><p>I think the birth of the baby will happen concurrently with the trial.  In essence, the rebirth of a great house and the death of another. </p><p>I think the iron throne will be gone and the it will be a parliamentary type government where each realm holds its autonomy but agree to certain inalienable conditions.  </p></p>",

        "answer": "<p>Hey, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mWn-sy8EQh3ySq6yjaxU6FA\">@cmollyo</a>!</p><p>Honestly, considering the shit these so called\u00a0\u201cBNFs\u201dhave been pulling in the last few days, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to assume they don\u2019t know anything about anything. Least of all, about how to be decent people.\u00a0</p><p>Anyway, getting back to your question. No, it isn\u2019t. Were you really expecting a different answer from me? :)))</p><p>Anyway, I\u2019ve already written a meta about the theory of Tyrion as the 3rd head of the dragon that you can find <a href=\"https://fortunatelylori.tumblr.com/post/183214694696/hey-fortunatelylori-im-sorry-if-this-question\">here</a>. I go into a lot of detail there on why I don\u2019t believe that Tyrion is Aerys\u2019 son and the inherent narrative issues with having him be a Targareyen bastard.\u00a0</p><p>So, instead of that, let\u2019s look at GRRM\u2019s quote, shall we?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Three heads of the dragon\u2026 yes\u2026 but the third will not necessarily BE a Targaryen\u2026<br/></p></blockquote><p>GRRM, like everyone involved in this series, has perfected the art of saying something without saying anything at all.\u00a0</p><p>People look at a statement like that and the conclusion they reach is: Dany has 3 dragons = there will be 3 dragon riders. There is also a bit of misdirection from GRRM that helps here since he has D*ny fantasize about riding her dragons alongside her\u00a0\u201cbrother husbands\u201d or something to that respect.\u00a0</p><p>But that\u2019s not really a good approach because of one significant detail: We have no idea what the 3 heads of the dragon is supposed to be.\u00a0</p><p>What we know of this prophecy is what Rhaegar said in a vision D*ny had in the House of the Undying:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Rhaegar: There must be one more. The dragon has three heads.</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s all we have to go by. Of course we can assume that this is linked to the House Targareyen sigil of the 3 headed dragon as well as the initial Targ triumvirate of Aegon/Rhaeyns/Visenya, particularly since Rhaegar seems to have intentionally named his children after the conquerors. We can also safely assume it has something to do with D*ny.\u00a0</p><p>But other than that? We don\u2019t know much of anything about this prophecy, what it relates to or what these 3 heads of the dragon are supposed to do. It\u2019s assumed Rhaegar believed that the 3 dragon heads were going to save the world from the WW apocalypse but even that\u2019s speculation because we don\u2019t actually know what Rhaegar believed, aside from thinking that this prophecy was important somehow.\u00a0</p><p>With that in mind, I will give you 3 more examples of what the 3 heads of the dragon might be. These are examples extrapolated from either the show or the books:\u00a0</p><p><b>D*ny/Jon/Young Griff</b>\u00a0</p><p>I think it\u2019s safe to assume that D*ny and Jon will both be involved somehow in this prophecy since they\u2019re the two confirmed Targs we currently have.
