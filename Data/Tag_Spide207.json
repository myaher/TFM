I&rsquo;m twenty one and in college. I&rsquo;m a girlfriend of Peter Parker AKA Spider-Man. And I&rsquo;m alone today. Well, I guess I have been for a while now. I haven&rsquo;t really realised it because of how busy I constantly am but deep down I have felt it for a long time.</p><p>But today is different. Something&rsquo;s wrong. People who I am used to see only frowning are suddenly smiling at me at every opportunity they have. I mean, I know I&rsquo;m pretty but this doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Like something bad is happening right now but I can&rsquo;t see it. It feels like something important but I can&rsquo;t seem to wrap my head around it.</p><p>Back to the weird smiles&hellip; I get them from two people who I&rsquo;m not that close with and to be honest, I hate them. With passion. Every time I see them I want to either yell or cry and I never know which is which. The outline of the suspects are pretty casual, I&rsquo;d say:</p><p>Mrs Warren is my boss. She&rsquo;s the owner of the Woken TV and I&rsquo;m an intern. I&rsquo;ve always dreamt of becoming a journalist and now I have a chance to gain some experience. She isn&rsquo;t rude but she has never smiled before. It&rsquo;s weird.</p><p>The second person is Jerry. He&rsquo;s a boy a little older than me who moved in the apartment next to mine. When I saw him for the first time he had a neutral face which didn&rsquo;t change for the next two weeks. I thought he just wasn&rsquo;t able to show any kind of emotions but then suddenly he&rsquo;s smiling at me when I greet him in the morning.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not nice but it&rsquo;s unnerving. I need to find the bottom of this. People don&rsquo;t just change like that. Maybe someone is blackmailing them? Or they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;them&rdquo;? I have a lot of ideas but I don&rsquo;t need ideas. I need leads and proofs. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m looking through every news article that says anything about people who started to behave like not themselves.\u00a0 I am currently sitting in the library near my college and I might fall asleep if I don&rsquo;t find anything interesting soon.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, miss, but could I ask you something?&rdquo; I look up to find a woman, probably in her thirties, looking at me unsurely.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, madame.&rdquo; I smiled politely and she relaxed a little.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Mary Jane Watson? The famous girl who knows, I&rsquo;m sorry, knew Spider-Man?&rdquo; Oh&hellip; Right. Peter&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; Yeah. I love him.&rdquo; I give her my fake smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we all&hellip;?&rdquo; Woman mumbles more to herself than me. I can&rsquo;t believe I haven&rsquo;t thought of this before. Oh, know I think about it. It&rsquo;s obvious. There&rsquo;s no conspiracy.</p><p>Smile. That was what has always been on my lips when Spidey was still here. I haven&rsquo;t smiled sincerely since he disappeared almost a year ago. How could I get so caught up with work to realise?</p><p>I need to see May. She&rsquo;s probably not okay now. It&rsquo;s an anniversary tomorrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I need to get somewhere.&rdquo; I say quietly and stand up. The woman gives me the smile I saw on Mrs Warren and Jerry. This particular smile that says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, you poor thing.&rdquo; I hate it. They treat Spider-Man like he died. Peter just has some problems. He&rsquo;s okay. He&rsquo;s coming back. He has to.</p><p>I walk out of the library and almost run to the small apartment in Queens. I take a deep breath and knock on the door. A moment later a skinny woman opens them and gives me a smile. </p><p>This smile. This one is different. She understands. She feels the same. She hurts too.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Aunt May.&rdquo; I say and she hugs me.</p><p>&ldquo;Afternoon, MJ. I hoped we could meet today and here you are.&rdquo; We separate and I walk into Parker&rsquo;s flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, tomorrow it&rsquo;ll be a year.&rdquo; I try to smile but my eyes start watering as I look at the very sofa I sat with my Pete only twelve months ago.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, May, I thought my boss and neighbor were conspiring against me. They, well, were always not the types to smile but suddenly today they just started to do so.\u00a0 I thought I was in some kind of danger. Old habits die hard, huh?</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>I wish I was able to hug him again&hellip;&rdquo; I whispere and May sits besides me.</p><p>&ldquo;Me too dear, me too. Do you want to come to the Tower with me tomorrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that. Thank you, May.&rdquo; I hug her and she draw circles on my back.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be alright, sweetie. Let me tell you an outline of tomorrow&rsquo;s plan, okay? First thing first, you sleep here tonight and in the morning we eat breakfast together. Then Happy will drive us to the Avengers Tower and we meet with Peter.

I\u2019m twenty one and in college. I\u2019m a girlfriend of Peter Parker AKA Spider-Man. And I\u2019m alone today. Well, I guess I have been for a while now. I haven\u2019t really realised it because of how busy I constantly am but deep down I have felt it for a long time.</p><p>But today is different. Something\u2019s wrong. People who I am used to see only frowning are suddenly smiling at me at every opportunity they have. I mean, I know I\u2019m pretty but this doesn\u2019t feel right. Like something bad is happening right now but I can\u2019t see it. It feels like something important but I can\u2019t seem to wrap my head around it.</p><p>Back to the weird smiles\u2026 I get them from two people who I\u2019m not that close with and to be honest, I hate them. With passion. Every time I see them I want to either yell or cry and I never know which is which. The outline of the suspects are pretty casual, I\u2019d say:</p><p>Mrs Warren is my boss. She\u2019s the owner of the Woken TV and I\u2019m an intern. I\u2019ve always dreamt of becoming a journalist and now I have a chance to gain some experience. She isn\u2019t rude but she has never smiled before. It\u2019s weird.</p><p>The second person is Jerry. He\u2019s a boy a little older than me who moved in the apartment next to mine. When I saw him for the first time he had a neutral face which didn\u2019t change for the next two weeks. I thought he just wasn\u2019t able to show any kind of emotions but then suddenly he\u2019s smiling at me when I greet him in the morning.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not nice but it\u2019s unnerving. I need to find the bottom of this. People don\u2019t just change like that. Maybe someone is blackmailing them? Or they\u2019re not \u201cthem\u201d? I have a lot of ideas but I don\u2019t need ideas. I need leads and proofs. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking through every news article that says anything about people who started to behave like not themselves.\u00a0 I am currently sitting in the library near my college and I might fall asleep if I don\u2019t find anything interesting soon.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, miss, but could I ask you something?\u201d I look up to find a woman, probably in her thirties, looking at me unsurely.</p><p>\u201cOf course, madame.\u201d I smiled politely and she relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cAre you Mary Jane Watson? The famous girl who knows, I\u2019m sorry, knew Spider-Man?\u201d Oh\u2026 Right. Peter\u2026</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 Yeah. I love him.\u201d I give her my fake smile.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we all\u2026?\u201d Woman mumbles more to herself than me. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t thought of this before. Oh, know I think about it. It\u2019s obvious. There\u2019s no conspiracy.</p><p>Smile. That was what has always been on my lips when Spidey was still here. I haven\u2019t smiled sincerely since he disappeared almost a year ago. How could I get so caught up with work to realise?</p><p>I need to see May. She\u2019s probably not okay now. It\u2019s an anniversary tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I need to get somewhere.\u201d I say quietly and stand up. The woman gives me the smile I saw on Mrs Warren and Jerry. This particular smile that says: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you, you poor thing.\u201d I hate it. They treat Spider-Man like he died. Peter just has some problems. He\u2019s okay. He\u2019s coming back. He has to.</p><p>I walk out of the library and almost run to the small apartment in Queens. I take a deep breath and knock on the door. A moment later a skinny woman opens them and gives me a smile. </p><p>This smile. This one is different. She understands. She feels the same. She hurts too.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Aunt May.\u201d I say and she hugs me.</p><p>\u201cAfternoon, MJ. I hoped we could meet today and here you are.\u201d We separate and I walk into Parker\u2019s flat.</p><p>\u201cWell, tomorrow it\u2019ll be a year.\u201d I try to smile but my eyes start watering as I look at the very sofa I sat with my Pete only twelve months ago.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, May, I thought my boss and neighbor were conspiring against me.

First thing first, you sleep here tonight and in the morning we eat breakfast together. Then Happy will drive us to the Avengers Tower and we meet with Peter.

Thank you, May.&rdquo; I hug her and she draw circles on my back.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be alright, sweetie. Let me tell you an outline of tomorrow&rsquo;s plan, okay? First thing first, you sleep here tonight and in the morning we eat breakfast together. Then Happy will drive us to the Avengers Tower and we meet with Peter. We eat lunch and decide if we want to go back yet. Sounds good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Thank you, May.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No problem, my dear. Coffee or tea?&rdquo; We let go of each other and smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Tea, please.&rdquo; The woman stand up nodding and I lean back against the cushions. The smile&hellip;</p><p>Why do I hate it so much? It may be the fact that I still have hope. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m one of the few who knows that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Or maybe I am just too close to a breakdown to handle pity. </p><p>If only I hadn&rsquo;t gone there. Petey would probably be here with his aunt. I just had to sneak into one of the most dangerous places in the whole New York, didn&rsquo;t I? No. Peter wouldn&rsquo;t want me to blame myself. He&rsquo;d want me to be better. It was a mistake. Nobody&rsquo;s fault. Well, maybe Green Goblin&rsquo;s since he was the one who attacked. Spider-Man was just in the right place in the wrong time and got hurt in the head too much to just get up and be okay. Just a little too late Iron Man was next to him after shooting Goblin. Just a few seconds too late and I&rsquo;m alone again. Aunt May is alone again. New York is alone again.</p><p>I can see pretty much the outline of the future: people without smiles and conspiracy theories if Spider-Man has ever been real.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t wait for Peter to wake up and show everyone that he can do it. Not because of some crazy spider powers but because he has us. His family. And we are not planning on leaving him anytime soon.</p>",

But when enemy forces invaded the town, Pete&rsquo;s uncle was one of many to be struck down. Pete fought hard but was bloodied and bruised none the less.
