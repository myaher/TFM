Or\u2014 He hadn\u2019t, exactly. Neither waiting nor patience were especial watchwords for Anthony J. Crowley, and so what he\u2019d really been doing was pacing around his flat waiting for words from on high \u2013 or, that is to say, on low. He hadn\u2019t had words from on high for quite some time.</p><p>It\u2019s been a few days.</p><p>All has, theoretically, gone back to normal.</p><p>All, except\u2026</p><p>He flicked on the television, which had not been the most expensive in the shop, but had been the one with the most complicated remote, and that had rather appealed. He liked it when technology seemed very complicated to operate, and he ordinarily enjoyed the meditative nature of flicking through thirty buttons to do something as simple as turn the volume down a fraction.</p><p>Static played from the television.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he asked, cautiously, in the voice of one torn between hoping for one result or the other</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve not had any orders, or any check-ins since\u2026 since it all went down, you know.\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>No answer. The static buzzed, and Crowley began cycling through buttons. S4C, the Welsh-language television channel, flickered onto the screen, and he finally managed to turn the volume up slightly. He waited with bated breath for the melodic, easy sounds of Welsh to morph into the buzzing tones of one of his superiors.</p><p>It didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>He flicked the television off, with only six wrong tries before he got the right button.</p><p>He\u2019d been to the graveyard. Every other Tuesday was the meeting time, usually, and yet this Tuesday\u2026 No one. Nobody.</p><p>He moved toward the phone, but before he could reach for it, it rang, and he picked up the receiver, holding it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Crowley said, \u201chas nobody talked to you either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d Aziraphale said anxiously. He didn\u2019t at all seem perturbed by the fact that Crowley knew who was calling. Perhaps he assumed that Crowley had some sort of technology to identify who was calling him<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn1\">[1]</a>. \u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he said put everything back to normal,\u201d Crowley said.</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Aziraphale muttered, without faith. \u201cHave you, er, tried\u2026 Tried any official mode of contact, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust talked to the television. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014 You know. I\u2026 I dialled the direct line, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my dear, I might as well have called a friend from a century ago. There\u2019s not just no answer. There\u2019s no\u2026 There\u2019s no tone. Er\u2014 You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley said woodenly.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s voice was terse and stiff and quiet, and Crowley drummed his fingers against the side of his television unit, feeling the uncomfortable, crawling tension in his chest as the angel went on. \u201cBut I\u2014 You know, I\u2019m not\u2026 I hardly think we\u2019ve been demoted, as it were. I remain in possession of my graces, and indeed, my Graces<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn2\">[2]</a>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, angel,\u201d Crowley muttered, without enthusiasm. \u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t noticed anything, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suppose they\u2019ve\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that would stop us being\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>There was a long, complicated pause on the other end of the line, and Crowley fancied he could see Aziraphale\u2019s lips moving as he rehearsed what it was he wanted to say, tasting the words before he loaned them voice. Finally, he answered, \u201cIf he wants us to be as we are \u2013 that is to say, an angel and a demon \u2013 we are, we will be, an angel and a demon. But he\u2026 Well. I think the boy rather a similar flaw to mine, in that, ahem, he can\u2019t really resist fixing something, if it might be fixed. And I was\u2026 I was thinking, dear boy, were I in such a position, what I might have done is just taken us off the books.\u201d</p><p>Crowley understood. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked that understanding, however, and so he repeated, \u201cTaken us off the\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreate a blindspot, as it were,\u201d Aziraphale continued, without hearing him. \u201cWe are what we are. They are as they are. And never the twain shall meet.\u201d</p><p>Crowley considered this for a long moment. The idea was unspeakable. To be as they were, but without their respective connections to Heaven and Hell, to be\u2026 Well. To be\u2014</p><p>Unspeakable was right.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a drink?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat desperately.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Crowley replied. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>They didn\u2019t actually bother to go anywhere.</p><p>They sat down in the park, on the green, on a picnic blanket. It was a warm day, clinging onto the dregs of summer, and while they split a bottle of wine between them, none of the passing policemen on their beat much liked the idea of coming to break up their date. One of them was in a suit, and the other was in a thick wool jumper \u2013 suffice to stay, taking their Lafitte off them doesn\u2019t seem like much cop when there were much more interesting bystanders to harass around London.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Crowley said. He took a sip of his wine, staring out over the duck pond. \u201cAlways thought about it. But I never really\u2026 I never really got as far as this point. I just thought, oh, wouldn\u2019t it be nice\u2026? And then thought about something else. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>A beat passed. It spanned the silences of centuries.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he amended, guiltily, staring down at his knees, which were clad in sensible tan trousers. \u201cBut it was never going to happen. I\u2014 What is one to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame stuff as always, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust without reporting it to the men upstairs. Er, in your case, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really cricket, is it?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>Crowley, who did not believe the term \u201cthat\u2019s not cricket\u201d had been used by anyone else for at least a hundred years, said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Aziraphale went on, \u201cwhat would the point be? If we did it without reporting on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman decency, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said softly. Saying it didn\u2019t avert the deep and crushing existential terror that was threatening to thunder down around his eyes, but it did meet a small bloom of satisfaction unfurl its flowers in his breast. He could be\u2026 He could be A.J. Crowley. He could just be\u2026 Anthony Crowley. No odd wishes, no giving up his powers, or his immortality. Just\u2014 Just being, and not having to report back downstairs.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t recorded, it hardly exists,\u201d Aziraphale said, not really hearing Crowley. He was several leagues inside his own head, and he found the weather very unpleasant indeed. \u201cErgo, there\u2019s no point doing it. And I\u2019m\u2026 That is to say, one does rather need a point, to exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d This was said with a vague gesture at the city around them. It was somewhat devoid of its usual, natural scorn. Then, he added, in a quietly hopeful tone, \u201cAnd there\u2019s the Arrangement<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn3\">[3]</a>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no point to it,\u201d Aziraphale snapped, \u201cif there aren\u2019t sides that we\u2019re on. If we\u2019re just\u2014 If we\u2019re just you and me, dear boy, with the ties to our respective commands cut away, then the Arrangement becomes just that: you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley agreed, feeling himself grin. \u201cYeah, it does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, and Crowley took a long sip of his drink, before glancing to his left, to see what had rendered Aziraphale silent. He followed Aziraphale\u2019s downturned gaze, and his eyes alighted, through the dark lenses of his sunglasses, on his own hand. It was on top of Aziraphale\u2019s, his fingers curled in to loosely clasp at it. The angel\u2019s hand, Crowley noted, was quite warm, and his touch didn\u2019t make Crowley\u2019s body any more inclined to burst into flames, or to smoke, or do anything along those lines, than it usually was.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cAre you\u2026 Are you sure, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Crowley said, with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything.\u201d He squeezed. After another moment\u2019s pause, Aziraphale\u2019s hand shifted in his own, their fingers interlinking, and he heard Aziraphale exhale breathily. \u201cD\u2019you want to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSushi?\u201d Aziraphale asked, hopefully. He had scooted slightly closer, so that their shoulders were touching. If Crowley was a human, his cheeks would have flushed. He wasn\u2019t one, but\u2026 What the Hell? He blushed anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Let\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s order just starters. Eat from the same plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe usually eat from the same plates,\u201d Aziraphale said. By this, he meant, \u201cI usually eat from your plate,\u201d as Crowley did not have the same appetite Aziraphale did, and often left his food unfinished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley agreed. \u201cYes. But\u2014 But let\u2019s make a spectacle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Aziraphale began.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Crowley decided, and this was how he showed he\u2019d decided: he leaned closer, so that his head rested on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, still holding his hand. He could feel the heat of his flush burning his cheeks, and he could feel his body\u2019s heart pumping a good deal more vigorously than usual. It was rather nice. \u201cYes,\u201d he decided a second time, for good measure. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, breathlessly. \u201cYes, I\u2026 I suppose we do.\u201d</p><p>For a long, long few minutes, they sat there, drinking their wine. Crowley leaned his head against Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, and Aziraphale put his cheek in toward the top of it, enjoying the spiced scent of the product Crowley wore to soften his hair. \u00a0The sun began to set over Soho.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split a dessert.\u201d It was said with such reckless enthusiasm that Crowley heard himself laugh. Later on, Aziraphale would eat the whole thing, bar for a mouthful, because Crowley wasn\u2019t actually one for dessert, but the point would be the look of the thing, the spectacle, and they would order it together.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, readily. He raised his wine glass. \u201cTo our godson, then. He did very well without our influence, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said, raising his own glass, and letting it clink against Crowley\u2019s. \u201cWe should\u2026 We should visit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be nice to do,\u201d Crowley mused. \u201cWhat with us being\u2014 Being retired, and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale agreed. They drained their glasses. \u201cRetired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could buy a cottage in Tadfield, and go there on weekends,\u201d Crowley said impulsively. \u201cDunroamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunmiracling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDundemoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunangeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun!\u201d</p><p>They sat together in the silence, and as one, they fell back on the grass, staring up at the reddening skies, and feeling the warmth of each other\u2019s palms, pressed tight together. In the stars, Crowley could divine no purpose at all.</p><p>It was unspeakable.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> In fact, Crowley did, but he hadn\u2019t looked at it. He hadn\u2019t needed to.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> One might mistakenly believe that one cannot capitalize words in spoken conversation, but Aziraphale rather had the knack.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Crowley, too, was able to capitalise words with his voice alone, although he ordinarily needed to have heard Aziraphale performing the practice first.

There\u2019s no\u2026 There\u2019s no tone. Er\u2014 You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley said woodenly.</p><p>Aziraphale\u2019s voice was terse and stiff and quiet, and Crowley drummed his fingers against the side of his television unit, feeling the uncomfortable, crawling tension in his chest as the angel went on. \u201cBut I\u2014 You know, I\u2019m not\u2026 I hardly think we\u2019ve been demoted, as it were.

Finally, he answered, \u201cIf he wants us to be as we are \u2013 that is to say, an angel and a demon \u2013 we are, we will be, an angel and a demon. But he\u2026 Well. I think the boy rather a similar flaw to mine, in that, ahem, he can\u2019t really resist fixing something, if it might be fixed.

He wasn\u2019t sure he liked that understanding, however, and so he repeated, \u201cTaken us off the\u2026?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreate a blindspot, as it were,\u201d Aziraphale continued, without hearing him. \u201cWe are what we are. They are as they are. And never the twain shall meet.\u201d</p><p>Crowley considered this for a long moment. The idea was unspeakable. To be as they were, but without their respective connections to Heaven and Hell, to be\u2026 Well. To be\u2014</p><p>Unspeakable was right.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a drink?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat desperately.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Crowley replied. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>They didn\u2019t actually bother to go anywhere.</p><p>They sat down in the park, on the green, on a picnic blanket. It was a warm day, clinging onto the dregs of summer, and while they split a bottle of wine between them, none of the passing policemen on their beat much liked the idea of coming to break up their date. One of them was in a suit, and the other was in a thick wool jumper \u2013 suffice to stay, taking their Lafitte off them doesn\u2019t seem like much cop when there were much more interesting bystanders to harass around London.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Crowley said. He took a sip of his wine, staring out over the duck pond. \u201cAlways thought about it. But I never really\u2026 I never really got as far as this point. I just thought, oh, wouldn\u2019t it be nice\u2026? And then thought about something else. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>A beat passed. It spanned the silences of centuries.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he amended, guiltily, staring down at his knees, which were clad in sensible tan trousers. \u201cBut it was never going to happen. I\u2014 What is one to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame stuff as always, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust without reporting it to the men upstairs. Er, in your case, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really cricket, is it?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>Crowley, who did not believe the term \u201cthat\u2019s not cricket\u201d had been used by anyone else for at least a hundred years, said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Aziraphale went on, \u201cwhat would the point be? If we did it without reporting on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman decency, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said softly. Saying it didn\u2019t avert the deep and crushing existential terror that was threatening to thunder down around his eyes, but it did meet a small bloom of satisfaction unfurl its flowers in his breast. He could be\u2026 He could be A.J. Crowley. He could just be\u2026 Anthony Crowley. No odd wishes, no giving up his powers, or his immortality. Just\u2014 Just being, and not having to report back downstairs.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t recorded, it hardly exists,\u201d Aziraphale said, not really hearing Crowley. He was several leagues inside his own head, and he found the weather very unpleasant indeed. \u201cErgo, there\u2019s no point doing it. And I\u2019m\u2026 That is to say, one does rather need a point, to exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d This was said with a vague gesture at the city around them. It was somewhat devoid of its usual, natural scorn. Then, he added, in a quietly hopeful tone, \u201cAnd there\u2019s the Arrangement<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn3\">[3]</a>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no point to it,\u201d Aziraphale snapped, \u201cif there aren\u2019t sides that we\u2019re on. If we\u2019re just\u2014 If we\u2019re just you and me, dear boy, with the ties to our respective commands cut away, then the Arrangement becomes just that: you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley agreed, feeling himself grin. \u201cYeah, it does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, and Crowley took a long sip of his drink, before glancing to his left, to see what had rendered Aziraphale silent. He followed Aziraphale\u2019s downturned gaze, and his eyes alighted, through the dark lenses of his sunglasses, on his own hand. It was on top of Aziraphale\u2019s, his fingers curled in to loosely clasp at it. The angel\u2019s hand, Crowley noted, was quite warm, and his touch didn\u2019t make Crowley\u2019s body any more inclined to burst into flames, or to smoke, or do anything along those lines, than it usually was.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cAre you\u2026 Are you sure, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Crowley said, with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything.\u201d He squeezed. After another moment\u2019s pause, Aziraphale\u2019s hand shifted in his own, their fingers interlinking, and he heard Aziraphale exhale breathily. \u201cD\u2019you want to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSushi?\u201d Aziraphale asked, hopefully. He had scooted slightly closer, so that their shoulders were touching. If Crowley was a human, his cheeks would have flushed. He wasn\u2019t one, but\u2026 What the Hell? He blushed anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Let\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s order just starters. Eat from the same plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe usually eat from the same plates,\u201d Aziraphale said. By this, he meant, \u201cI usually eat from your plate,\u201d as Crowley did not have the same appetite Aziraphale did, and often left his food unfinished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley agreed. \u201cYes. But\u2014 But let\u2019s make a spectacle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Aziraphale began.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Crowley decided, and this was how he showed he\u2019d decided: he leaned closer, so that his head rested on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, still holding his hand. He could feel the heat of his flush burning his cheeks, and he could feel his body\u2019s heart pumping a good deal more vigorously than usual. It was rather nice. \u201cYes,\u201d he decided a second time, for good measure. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, breathlessly. \u201cYes, I\u2026 I suppose we do.\u201d</p><p>For a long, long few minutes, they sat there, drinking their wine. Crowley leaned his head against Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, and Aziraphale put his cheek in toward the top of it, enjoying the spiced scent of the product Crowley wore to soften his hair. \u00a0The sun began to set over Soho.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split a dessert.\u201d It was said with such reckless enthusiasm that Crowley heard himself laugh. Later on, Aziraphale would eat the whole thing, bar for a mouthful, because Crowley wasn\u2019t actually one for dessert, but the point would be the look of the thing, the spectacle, and they would order it together.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, readily. He raised his wine glass. \u201cTo our godson, then. He did very well without our influence, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said, raising his own glass, and letting it clink against Crowley\u2019s. \u201cWe should\u2026 We should visit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be nice to do,\u201d Crowley mused. \u201cWhat with us being\u2014 Being retired, and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale agreed. They drained their glasses. \u201cRetired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could buy a cottage in Tadfield, and go there on weekends,\u201d Crowley said impulsively. \u201cDunroamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunmiracling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDundemoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunangeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun!\u201d</p><p>They sat together in the silence, and as one, they fell back on the grass, staring up at the reddening skies, and feeling the warmth of each other\u2019s palms, pressed tight together. In the stars, Crowley could divine no purpose at all.</p><p>It was unspeakable.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> In fact, Crowley did, but he hadn\u2019t looked at it. He hadn\u2019t needed to.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> One might mistakenly believe that one cannot capitalize words in spoken conversation, but Aziraphale rather had the knack.</p><p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Crowley, too, was able to capitalise words with his voice alone, although he ordinarily needed to have heard Aziraphale performing the practice first. Luckily, he usually had.</p></p>",

To be\u2014</p><p>Unspeakable was right.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go for a drink?\u201d Aziraphale asked, somewhat desperately.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Crowley replied. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u2013</p><p>They didn\u2019t actually bother to go anywhere.</p><p>They sat down in the park, on the green, on a picnic blanket. It was a warm day, clinging onto the dregs of summer, and while they split a bottle of wine between them, none of the passing policemen on their beat much liked the idea of coming to break up their date. One of them was in a suit, and the other was in a thick wool jumper \u2013 suffice to stay, taking their Lafitte off them doesn\u2019t seem like much cop when there were much more interesting bystanders to harass around London.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Crowley said. He took a sip of his wine, staring out over the duck pond. \u201cAlways thought about it. But I never really\u2026 I never really got as far as this point. I just thought, oh, wouldn\u2019t it be nice\u2026? And then thought about something else. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Aziraphale said.</p><p>A beat passed. It spanned the silences of centuries.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he amended, guiltily, staring down at his knees, which were clad in sensible tan trousers. \u201cBut it was never going to happen. I\u2014 What is one to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame stuff as always, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cJust without reporting it to the men upstairs. Er, in your case, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really cricket, is it?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>Crowley, who did not believe the term \u201cthat\u2019s not cricket\u201d had been used by anyone else for at least a hundred years, said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Aziraphale went on, \u201cwhat would the point be? If we did it without reporting on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman decency, I suppose,\u201d Crowley said softly. Saying it didn\u2019t avert the deep and crushing existential terror that was threatening to thunder down around his eyes, but it did meet a small bloom of satisfaction unfurl its flowers in his breast. He could be\u2026 He could be A.J. Crowley. He could just be\u2026 Anthony Crowley. No odd wishes, no giving up his powers, or his immortality. Just\u2014 Just being, and not having to report back downstairs.</p><p>His head spun.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t recorded, it hardly exists,\u201d Aziraphale said, not really hearing Crowley. He was several leagues inside his own head, and he found the weather very unpleasant indeed. \u201cErgo, there\u2019s no point doing it. And I\u2019m\u2026 That is to say, one does rather need a point, to exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Crowley asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d This was said with a vague gesture at the city around them. It was somewhat devoid of its usual, natural scorn. Then, he added, in a quietly hopeful tone, \u201cAnd there\u2019s the Arrangement<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn3\">[3]</a>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no point to it,\u201d Aziraphale snapped, \u201cif there aren\u2019t sides that we\u2019re on. If we\u2019re just\u2014 If we\u2019re just you and me, dear boy, with the ties to our respective commands cut away, then the Arrangement becomes just that: you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Crowley agreed, feeling himself grin. \u201cYeah, it does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, and Crowley took a long sip of his drink, before glancing to his left, to see what had rendered Aziraphale silent. He followed Aziraphale\u2019s downturned gaze, and his eyes alighted, through the dark lenses of his sunglasses, on his own hand. It was on top of Aziraphale\u2019s, his fingers curled in to loosely clasp at it. The angel\u2019s hand, Crowley noted, was quite warm, and his touch didn\u2019t make Crowley\u2019s body any more inclined to burst into flames, or to smoke, or do anything along those lines, than it usually was.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Aziraphale said. \u201cAre you\u2026 Are you sure, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Crowley said, with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of anything.\u201d He squeezed. After another moment\u2019s pause, Aziraphale\u2019s hand shifted in his own, their fingers interlinking, and he heard Aziraphale exhale breathily. \u201cD\u2019you want to go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSushi?\u201d Aziraphale asked, hopefully. He had scooted slightly closer, so that their shoulders were touching. If Crowley was a human, his cheeks would have flushed. He wasn\u2019t one, but\u2026 What the Hell? He blushed anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Let\u2019s\u2026 Let\u2019s order just starters. Eat from the same plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe usually eat from the same plates,\u201d Aziraphale said. By this, he meant, \u201cI usually eat from your plate,\u201d as Crowley did not have the same appetite Aziraphale did, and often left his food unfinished.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Crowley agreed. \u201cYes. But\u2014 But let\u2019s make a spectacle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Aziraphale began.</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Crowley decided, and this was how he showed he\u2019d decided: he leaned closer, so that his head rested on Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, still holding his hand. He could feel the heat of his flush burning his cheeks, and he could feel his body\u2019s heart pumping a good deal more vigorously than usual. It was rather nice. \u201cYes,\u201d he decided a second time, for good measure. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said, breathlessly. \u201cYes, I\u2026 I suppose we do.\u201d</p><p>For a long, long few minutes, they sat there, drinking their wine. Crowley leaned his head against Aziraphale\u2019s shoulder, and Aziraphale put his cheek in toward the top of it, enjoying the spiced scent of the product Crowley wore to soften his hair. \u00a0The sun began to set over Soho.</p><p>\u201cCrowley?\u201d Aziraphale asked.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split a dessert.\u201d It was said with such reckless enthusiasm that Crowley heard himself laugh. Later on, Aziraphale would eat the whole thing, bar for a mouthful, because Crowley wasn\u2019t actually one for dessert, but the point would be the look of the thing, the spectacle, and they would order it together.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed, readily. He raised his wine glass. \u201cTo our godson, then. He did very well without our influence, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale said, raising his own glass, and letting it clink against Crowley\u2019s. \u201cWe should\u2026 We should visit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould be nice to do,\u201d Crowley mused. \u201cWhat with us being\u2014 Being retired, and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aziraphale agreed. They drained their glasses. \u201cRetired!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could buy a cottage in Tadfield, and go there on weekends,\u201d Crowley said impulsively. \u201cDunroamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunmiracling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDundemoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunangeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDun!\u201d</p><p>They sat together in the silence, and as one, they fell back on the grass, staring up at the reddening skies, and feeling the warmth of each other\u2019s palms, pressed tight together.

Or&mdash; He hadn&rsquo;t, exactly. Neither waiting nor patience were especial watchwords for Anthony J. Crowley, and so what he&rsquo;d really been doing was pacing around his flat waiting for words from on high &ndash; or, that is to say, on low. He hadn&rsquo;t had words from on high for quite some time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a few days.</p><p>All has, theoretically, gone back to normal.</p><p>All, except&hellip;</p><p>He flicked on the television, which had not been the most expensive in the shop, but had been the one with the most complicated remote, and that had rather appealed. He liked it when technology seemed very complicated to operate, and he ordinarily enjoyed the meditative nature of flicking through thirty buttons to do something as simple as turn the volume down a fraction.</p><p>Static played from the television.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he asked, cautiously, in the voice of one torn between hoping for one result or the other</p><p>No answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had any orders, or any check-ins since&hellip; since it all went down, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>No answer. The static buzzed, and Crowley began cycling through buttons. S4C, the Welsh-language television channel, flickered onto the screen, and he finally managed to turn the volume up slightly. He waited with bated breath for the melodic, easy sounds of Welsh to morph into the buzzing tones of one of his superiors.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t happen.</p><p>He flicked the television off, with only six wrong tries before he got the right button.</p><p>He&rsquo;d been to the graveyard. Every other Tuesday was the meeting time, usually, and yet this Tuesday&hellip; No one. Nobody.</p><p>He moved toward the phone, but before he could reach for it, it rang, and he picked up the receiver, holding it to his ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; Crowley said, &ldquo;has nobody talked to you either?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; Aziraphale said anxiously. He didn&rsquo;t at all seem perturbed by the fact that Crowley knew who was calling. Perhaps he assumed that Crowley had some sort of technology to identify who was calling him<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn1\">[1]</a>. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he said put everything back to normal,&rdquo; Crowley said.</p><p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; Aziraphale muttered, without faith. &ldquo;Have you, er, tried&hellip; Tried any official mode of contact, yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Crowley said. &ldquo;Just talked to the television. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash; You know. I&hellip; I dialled the direct line, as it were.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, I might as well have called a friend from a century ago. There&rsquo;s not just no answer. There&rsquo;s no&hellip; There&rsquo;s no tone. Er&mdash; You know what I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Crowley said woodenly.</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s voice was terse and stiff and quiet, and Crowley drummed his fingers against the side of his television unit, feeling the uncomfortable, crawling tension in his chest as the angel went on. &ldquo;But I&mdash; You know, I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I hardly think we&rsquo;ve been demoted, as it were. I remain in possession of my graces, and indeed, my Graces<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17859086#_ftn2\">[2]</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good, angel,&rdquo; Crowley muttered, without enthusiasm. &ldquo;Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t noticed anything, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ve&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, can they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But that would stop us being&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure it would.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>There was a long, complicated pause on the other end of the line, and Crowley fancied he could see Aziraphale&rsquo;s lips moving as he rehearsed what it was he wanted to say, tasting the words before he loaned them voice. Finally, he answered, &ldquo;If he wants us to be as we are &ndash; that is to say, an angel and a demon &ndash; we are, we will be, an angel and a demon. But he&hellip; Well. I think the boy rather a similar flaw to mine, in that, ahem, he can&rsquo;t really resist fixing something, if it might be fixed. And I was&hellip; I was thinking, dear boy, were I in such a position, what I might have done is just taken us off the books.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley understood. He wasn&rsquo;t sure he liked that understanding, however, and so he repeated, &ldquo;Taken us off the&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Create a blindspot, as it were,&rdquo; Aziraphale continued, without hearing him. &ldquo;We are what we are. They are as they are. And never the twain shall meet.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley considered this for a long moment. The idea was unspeakable.
