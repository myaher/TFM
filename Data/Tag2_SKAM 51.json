Idriss and Sofiane had blown up the group chat trying to make plans for the weekend and Eliott was trying to decide whether or not he should bother reading the texts or if he should just ignore them.</p><p>Idriss was suggesting another basketball game since, according to him, they still had to defeat Imane&rsquo;s team. Eliott didn&rsquo;t really know if he would want to play again, he would much rather just sit this one out and simply watch. So, remembering what Alex had asked him when they had had lunch together, he that it would be a good idea to ask if his friends were willing to have someone else on their team.</p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>What if I asked a friend to take my place in the game?</i></p><p><b>Sofiane:</b></p><p><i>Does he know how to play?</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>Better than me, for sure</i></p><p><b>Idriss:</b></p><p><i>Then you will hear no complaints about him taking your place</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>I can feel the love</i></p><p><i>Tell me when the game is going to be so I can text him</i></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t get to see Idriss or Sofiane&rsquo;s answer because the sound of a backpack being dropped next to his feet startled him and made him look up.</p><!-- more --><p>Lucas was standing there in front of him, one foot on top of his skateboard and the other on the concrete. He had a smile on his face and his hands inside his pockets, a grin that showed he knew he had startled Eliott and was actually proud of it stretching on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he greeted.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you just have said that before scaring me?&rdquo; Eliott asked, amused.</p><p>Well,&ldquo; Lucas pretended to think. &quot;I could have, but where would be the fun in that?&rdquo;</p><p>He sat down next to Eliott and took his hands out from his pockets so that he could grab his backpack and take two chocolate bars from it.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, offering Eliott one of them. &ldquo;To apologize for startling you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not like you&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; Eliott raised an unimpressed eyebrow but grabbed the chocolate anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&quot;Lucas took a bite off of his own chocolate.</p><p>&quot;Home,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;I wanted to go to the park later, but I&rsquo;m a little too tired for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know what you mean,&rdquo; he nodded at his skateboard. &ldquo;It can be tiring to hear all those kids screaming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a park, Lucas, kids use it to play. What were you expecting?&rdquo; Eliott laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Peace and quiet,&rdquo; Lucas deadpanned.</p><p>&ldquo;And you? Where are you going?&rdquo; Eliott asked while opening his chocolate bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I was going home, too, but Mika, one of my roommates, apparently has someone over. If you know what I mean,&rdquo; he wrinkled his nose. &ldquo;Manon was kind enough to tell me I was better outside the flat for now.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott snorted, not envying Lucas&rsquo; situation but finding it quite amusing nonetheless.</p><p>&ldquo;You live with roommates?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, two of them. Manon used to live with us too but it was tight fitting and she ended up moving next door.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas looked a bit torn about talking about his living situation and Eliott wondered if there was something more behind it and whether he should ask about it or not. In the end, he didn&rsquo;t have to choose because his bus was approaching them quickly and he had to stand up.</p><p>Eliott looked at Lucas and hesitated before saying goodbye to him. He didn&rsquo;t know if it would be overstepping to ask him if he wanted to come with him, he wasn&rsquo;t really sure if they already were close enough to warrant that invitation. But, the truth was, Eliott just wanted to spend more time with Lucas. And, all in all, he had no problem inviting him to spend time with him in his house. What was the worst that could happen, anyway? Lucas saying no?</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to come with me?&rdquo; He asked before he could change his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;To your house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to impose,&rdquo; Lucas shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be inviting you if you were,&rdquo; he assured and added when he saw the bus stop in front of them. &ldquo;Besides, I want to spend more time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas looked up at him through his lashes, eyes alight with curiosity and wonder. Eliott had never seen anything as beautiful before.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; Lucas smiled.</p><p>He got up and grabbed both his backpack and skateboard before turning to Eliott with trusting eyes and following him to where the bus&rsquo; door was opening.</p><p>***</p><p>Eliott had never minded having friends over. Sofiane and Idriss and even Alex came over enough times for him to get used to it, but there was something different about this. Opening the door to Lucas wasn&rsquo;t the same thing as opening the door to one of his other friends. And guiding Lucas to his room, with a hand on the small of his back, felt like much more than simply showing a friend the way around his house.</p><p>He stopped by the kitchen to get something for them to drink and eat and watched, endeared, as Lucas stood on the doorway looking a little out of place. Eliott would make sure that by the time he left today he would feel comfortable enough to want to return.</p><p>In Eliott&rsquo;s room, he opened the beers that he had brought for them and put them and the snack on top of his desk. Lucas put his skateboard at the corner of Eliott\u00a1s room, right next to where his guitar was resting. Then, he took off his backpack and threw them to Eliott&rsquo;s chair.</p><p>The sight of the skateboard resting next to his guitar send something warm running down Eliott&rsquo;s body. They had met through those two things and having them in here, in his room, one next to the other, seemed to confirm that Eliott and Lucas had come together and where now closer, were friends and still getting to know each other. Still <i>interested</i>.</p><p>Eliott waited as Lucas looked around his room and absorbed what he saw. He seemed the most interested in the drawings Eliott had on his walls and Eliott had never before felt both this proud and this unguarded at the same time. The drawings were such an important part of him that he felt exposed every time someone saw them.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you draw them?&rdquo; Lucas asked, eyes still full of wonder and curiosity like Eliott loved to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Eliott nodded, turning to look at the drawings too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been drawing myself for years now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The raccoon,&rdquo; Eliott pointed at the drawings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my spirit animal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your spirit animal?&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow as if the words made no sense in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You know, an animal I identify myself with?&rdquo; Eliott tensed up, not sure if Lucas was going to find it stupid and want to leave or not.</p><p>He looked up. Lucas still didn&rsquo;t look too convinced and there was still a slightly confused expression on his face and that worried Eliott. Just a little, though. Because there was also fondness in his eyes and that put a stop to Eliott&rsquo;s worries more than anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;And the other animals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends and family. Sofiane is the quokka and Idriss is the tiger,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The bear is my mom and the coyote is my dad. The hummingbird is my little cousin. And Alex is the wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed pensive, his eyes trained to the drawings with a slightly dazzled expression on his face. The blatant display of how impressed he was by Eliott thinking so deeply about the important people in his life he was showing blew Eliott away. He wasn&rsquo;t expecting Lucas to feel like that about his drawings at all.</p><p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; Lucas said suddenly, eyes darting between the drawings on the wall and Eliott&rsquo;s own eyes, tone a mix of shy and challenging. &ldquo;How would you draw me?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott turned to look fully at him, all his attention on Lucas and what he had just said. Lucas&rsquo; question had taken him by surprise. The implication behind it making Eliott&rsquo;s heart beat faster. Lucas wanted Eliott to consider drawing him, wanted to be important enough in Eliott&rsquo;s life to warrant a place on his wall of drawings.</p><p>And Eliott couldn&rsquo;t help but take in all of the boy in front of him. Couldn&rsquo;t help but look at him from his head to his feet and think about all the small things about Lucas he had discovered in the short time he had known him. Couldn&rsquo;t help but want the same thing Lucas did.</p><p>Eliott wanted to draw him and put the drawing on his wall, because Lucas was rapidly becoming a very important person in his life.</p><p>And maybe Eliott already knew how he would be drawing Lucas. He thought back to the basketball game, to the way Lucas had been spiky and defensive but also playful and happy, then, Eliott looked at Lucas&rsquo; hair again and the image was more than clear in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said anyway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to get to know you better.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas raised both his eyebrows mischievously and grabbed his beer before sitting on Eliott&rsquo;s bed. Eliott took a second before following his lead and sitting next to him with his own drink in hand, glad to see that Lucas already seemed more comfortable in his house or, at least, in his room.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Lucas started. &ldquo;On top of being amazing at playing the guitar, you&rsquo;re also talented at drawing?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott felt his face grow hot and he gripped the bottle in his hand tighter. As much as he appreciated getting complimented, he had never really known how to react in the face of one and, getting not one but two compliments in one sentence from Lucas, of all people, seemed like a completely different scenario he had never had to deal with.</p><p>&ldquo;I- Thank you,&rdquo; Eliott said, taking a gulp of his beer.</p><p>Lucas smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;No need to get flustered. I&rsquo;m just saying the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Eliott grumbled, pushing his arm playfully.</p><p>Lucas laughed and looked around the room before turning his eyes to Eliott again.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you at the park yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you now?&rdquo; Eliott looked at him too. &ldquo;I went shopping with my mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll forgive you this time then,&rdquo; Lucas teased.</p><p>They finished their beers among teasing words and casual touches, jumping from topic to topic without focusing too much on anything. It was very laid back and Eliott was happy, if not slightly surprised, to see that he already felt as comfortable with Lucas, who he had met a few weeks ago, as he felt with some of his friends that he had known longer.</p><p>When they finished their drinks, Eliott took both bottles and put them on top of his desk again.</p><p>The sight of Lucas, laying on his back on Eliott&rsquo;s bed with his legs dangling from the bottom of it, made Eliott&rsquo;s heart race with the possibility of more afternoons spent like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you just going to stand there?&rdquo; Lucas&rsquo; voice interrupted his musings.</p><p>Eliott shook his head before moving to his bed and sitting with his back against the headboard, Lucas&rsquo; head near his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you always draw what happens in your life?&rdquo; Lucas asked.</p><p>He seemed curious, interested in what Eliott had to say and, although Eliott wasn&rsquo;t sure where this conversation would end up, he couldn&rsquo;t just not answer Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s something that feels important one way or the other, I usually draw it.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas turned around in the bed so that he was stomach down, legs kicked up and with his head resting on his hands, facing Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;One way or the other?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott chuckled, looked at his wall and then back at Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;Despite what my walls might say, I don&rsquo;t draw only the good things.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas nodded in understanding and, to Eliott&rsquo;s surprise, added.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you burn the ones about bad things?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Lucas seemed to hesitate slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that- When I was younger, and even now sometimes, I used to write down what I was feeling and what had happened when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling my best. And then I burned the paper. I- just thought that maybe you could have the same coping mechanism.&rdquo;</p><p>He fidgeted a little with his hands, looking down at Eliott&rsquo;s bed, looking the most insecure Eliott had ever seen him. Eliott wanted to ease his worries away, take the frown away from his face and stop the thoughts of regret that were surely swirling inside Lucas&rsquo; head. He knew how hard it was to talk about things that were personal and he felt honoured that Lucas had felt comfortable enough to share with him something that he didn&rsquo;t go around telling just about anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t burn them, though sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing I want to do more than that,&rdquo; Eliott said, trying to meet Lucas&rsquo; eyes, but he wouldn&rsquo;t look up. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t do something similar.&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed to do the trick and Lucas looked back up at Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it that you do?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighed, looking him in the eye and considered his options. He could just tell Lucas how he coped and end the conversation there, he knew Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t press for more and they could move onto easier waters, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted that. Because he had another option, he could open up to Lucas. He could tell him what he did <i>and </i>explain to him what was behind it, bring the past up and talk about it. And he felt like he could trust Lucas, he felt safe with him.</p><p>He got up, ignoring Lucas&rsquo; small surprise noise at the sudden movement, and crouched next to the bed. He reached under it and stopped to stare at Lucas again when his fingers touched the lid of the box he kept there.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep all of the drawings about the bad days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I keep them hidden in this box and never really look at them or share them with anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas sat up straighter and Eliott got back on the bed and put the black box between them.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly burning,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;But I guess it does the same job.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott took a breathe and moved to open the box.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to show me anything,&rdquo; Lucas rushed out, hands flying to grip Eliott&rsquo;s wrists. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously very private. You don&rsquo;t have to, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas&rsquo; eyes met his and Eliott saw how worried he was that Eliott was going to do or say something he didn&rsquo;t actually want to. He could see that Lucas hadn&rsquo;t said anything with the intent to pry into Eliott&rsquo;s life. And that made it for Eliott. He wanted to open up to Lucas, he wanted to talk to him about what haunted him and what made him <i>Eliott</i>, and he knew that Lucas would listen to him.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure why he wanted to talk about his feeling all of a sudden, but he knew that it was probably because the person in front of him was Lucas. They hadn&rsquo;t met that long ago, but Eliott wanted to learn things about Lucas and let Lucas learn things about himself. It was a desire he couldn&rsquo;t quite explain, but it was there and it felt <i>right </i>and Eliott wouldn&rsquo;t let it get away.</p><p>Eliott smiled reassuringly at Lucas and released his hands from his grip.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that sometimes it&rsquo;s good to talk,&rdquo; he made eye contact with Lucas to show he was serious before adding. &ldquo;Some people are worth opening up to.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed to be reassured by that, his hands dropped to his thighs and he licked his lips, eyes never leaving Eliott&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I one of those people?&rdquo; He asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; Eliott said simply.</p><p>Lucas shuddered, his breath coming out shaky. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face for a fleeting moment, betraying how shocked he seemed to be that Eliott could think about him that way.</p><p>Instead of saying anything else to reassure Lucas that he was indeed the kind of person Eliott wanted to get to know and let into his life, he simply took the lid off of the black box and searched for the right drawings to start telling Lucas his story.</p><p>The first drawing he took off of the box was that of a little kid looking from the outside as four other kids played football together. Eliott smiled sadly down at it and caressed the paper with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t always draw people as their spirit animal,&rdquo; Eliott said. &ldquo;That started later. Before, I actually used to draw the human figure as it is. Not that I was ever as good at drawing people as I am at drawing animals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why is this drawing in the box?&rdquo; Lucas asked, voice soft and serious.</p><p>Once again, Lucas said exactly the words Eliott needed to hear. A simple question, but the words that showed that he understood Eliott and wanted to know more. The words that only came to confirm that Lucas was exactly the person Eliott by his side.</p><p>&ldquo;When I drew that, I was feeling alone,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The other kids are Sofiane, Idriss and two other guys who I haven&rsquo;t seen in forever. We were always playing together, but, at one point, I started feeling like I was just there. Outside, looking in, you know? I was probably about eleven?&rdquo; Eliott shook his head, unsure about the actual age or date. &ldquo;It was when things started going downhill for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott took a breath, lost in the memories of the times when he felt like an outsider in his own life. He knew now that it was all in his head, but it still had felt real at the time and it had marked him enough to put on paper.</p><p>He wished he could say that things went better for him after that, but, the truth was, the box in front of him had many more drawings inside and that was enough to prove that things hadn&rsquo;t really gotten easier. On the contrary, in fact.</p><p>&ldquo;Things only got worse after that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I started drawing the spirit animals.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, grabbing the one he wanted to show Lucas next.</p><p>&ldquo;We learned about animals in class when I was twelve. It kind of made me go on a spiral of research. I wanted to know everything about them and then I stumbled upon the words &lsquo;spirit animal&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told Lucas. &ldquo;And then I did some research on that, too. Gave spirit animals to myself and to the people who were important to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave the drawing to Lucas. Little raccoon ears peaking from the top of a stone wall.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t really talk to anyone or trust anyone at the time. It was as if there was something separating me from the rest of the world. And, by shutting everyone out, I felt a little bit safer. It was just me,&rdquo; he pointed to the drawing. &ldquo;Me and my wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eliott\u2026&rdquo; Lucas breathed out, sounding unsure about what he should say.</p><p>Eliott just smiled at him and shook his head, reaching out to squeeze one of Lucas&rsquo; hands in reassurance. He didn&rsquo;t need him to say anything. Having him there, listening and showing interest in knowing this part of Eliott meant more to him than any words ever could.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said just to make sure Lucas knew.</p><p>He reached for the next drawing and hesitated. This was when, ironically since it had been such a dark time in his life, things really became clear. If he shared this with Lucas now, there would be no going back, no <i>hiding</i>.</p><p>One look at Lucas&rsquo; open, tender, supportive expression was all it took to ease Eliott&rsquo;s worries.</p><p>&ldquo;When I was thirteen, I went through one of the worst periods in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Lucas gasp, a sound that showed his fear and worry about what Eliott was about to tell him. It warmed Eliott up to know that he cared enough despite the small amount of time they had known each other, to sit through this conversation and listen to it with interest and worry and just <i>care</i>.</p><p>He gave him the drawing. A raccoon hidden behind way too many lines scattered around, frantic and uneven and chaotic. His mind had been a mess and that had been the only way to properly show it on the paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Things didn&rsquo;t make sense. I spent weeks feeling amazing and then, all of sudden, I just wanted to lay in bed and sleep. I didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening and the confusion only made everything worse, because I understood that it wasn&rsquo;t natural to feel like that, not to that extent at least,&rdquo; he sighed, eyes shifting to the wall and becoming unfocused. &ldquo;Eventually, after a week of almost no sleep at all and spending every hour researching, followed by a week when I just wanted to sleep, my parents took me to a professional.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed to be on the edge of his seat, ready to know and take in whatever Eliott was going to tell him.</p><p>Eliott looked into Lucas&rsquo; eyes again. Yes, it was easier to open up when he was staring at a wall, but a wall was nothing when compared to Lucas&rsquo; eyes. With his eyes locked on Lucas&rsquo;, Eliott found the courage he needed to say what he never really told that many people, the part of him he preferred to keep hidden most of the time.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bipolar.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a beat of silence. Lucas blinked at him, inclined his head to one side with a thoughtful look in his eyes. And then he smiled, a small smile that made the tension that had settled on Eliott&rsquo;s shoulders dissipate.</p><p>Lucas wasn&rsquo;t leaving. He wasn&rsquo;t running for the hills and never talking to him anymore. He was still here.</p><p>Lucas shifted the box to one side so that he could move closer to Eliott. He kneed in front of him, sitting on his heels and looking at Eliott with a soft look on his face that gave him the confidence to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s not easy to deal with me,&rdquo; Eliott said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s times when I can&rsquo;t leave my bed and times when I&rsquo;m overhyper and will do anything. Sometimes I cry and scream and yell for no reason. I&rsquo;m always afraid that I will hurt someone I care about without meaning to. It&rsquo;s quite hard a lot of the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me,&rdquo; Lucas raised a hand to rest on Eliott&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t easy.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>&ldquo;I- Not that many people know.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas lowered his head a little, a signal of reverence that no one had ever shown Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel honoured, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott felt a blush creeping up his cheeks at Lucas&rsquo; words and his intense stare. It seemed he was looking straight into Eliott&rsquo;s soul and make sure every last part of Eliott knew he was there, proud and happy and <i>enamoured</i>. That was one word Eliott had never expected to use to describe the way someone stared at him, but it was the only one that seemed to fit properly the depth of Lucas&rsquo; eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I started playing guitar around that time. Music always helped ground me a little, in a way, and I told my therapist that once. She told me that maybe actually making music could be great for me and to try it out,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I did and it was the best thing I could have done. I haven&rsquo;t stopped since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did,&rdquo; Lucas whispered in the space between them, thumb caressing Eliott&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing and that was what mesmerized me about you in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott bit his lip. Lucas felt the same, he was sure of it. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and he never wanted Lucas to leave his bed, never really wanted him to be farther away from him than he was right now. And he wanted to make sure Lucas knew that. So, he leaned in a little, Lucas&rsquo; hand falling from his cheek to the side of his neck and kissed Lucas&rsquo; cheek gently, feeling it warm up against his lips with Lucas&rsquo; blush.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mesmerized by you too,&rdquo; he breathed out, lips still touching Lucas&rsquo; skin.</p><p>He felt Lucas&rsquo; answering shudder and leaned back again to look at his face. He was blushing, but there was a happy smile on his face and Eliott felt his lips stretch into an answering grin. This was all Eliott wanted.</p><p>Then, still wanting Lucas to know more, Eliott showed him other drawings he found important to the story he was trying to tell. Images of raccons, mostly alone or clearly separated from quokkas, tigers, bears and coyotes. Pictures of loneliness, sadness and helplessness. Reaching low lows, coming up for air and breathing only to go down again and almost suffocate in chaotic thoughts. A raccoon, smaller than ever before, looking at an intimately big building, failing school having taken its toll on him. The aftermath of that, with the months of blame and guilt and disappointment and then breathing again like resurfacing.</p><p>When Eliott finished his story, the box was sitting on the floor and Eliott and Lucas were laying on the bed, side by side.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy that you told me so much about yourself,&rdquo; Lucas said, turning his head to stare at the side of Eliott&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. It means a lot that you trusted me enough to tell me these personal things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an easy person to trust,&rdquo; Eliott turned his head too. &ldquo;And I did want to trust you. I want to get to know you. And I want you to get to know me; all of me. Even the shitty parts.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shook his head and turned on his side so his whole body was facing Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing shitty about you, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighed, happiness and peace coursing through his veins and leaving a warm trail behind. He felt so at ease and so relaxed with Lucas laying next to him as if nothing could touch him or hurt him. As if he was exactly where he should be, where he belonged. He reached down and grabbed Lucas&rsquo; hand, squeezing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for listening to me-&rdquo; Eliott started saying but Lucas interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me. You deserve to be listened to. And besides,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;I also want to know everything about you, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>He breathed out his name like it was too precious to be said any louder or any less carefully. And then he leaned in and kissed his forehead, Eliott felt his smile on his skin and exhaled, his breath hitting Lucas&rsquo; neck and making him shiver slightly.</p><p>Eliott never wanted this moment to end. He never wanted to let go of Lucas, but he knew, logically, that he would eventually have to, since the afternoon would turn into night. So, he just reached out, wrapped his arms around Lucas and brought him closer to him. Felt Lucas hug him back and kiss his collarbone softly, gentle lips and gentle breath.</p><p>And he didn&rsquo;t let go until Lucas&rsquo; phone vibrated and he had to leave and, even then, it was a struggle unwrap his arms from around him.</p><p>After Lucas left, Eliott sat at his desk with the smell of Lucas&rsquo; cologne clinging slightly to his hoodie and started drawing.</p><p>He drew a hedgehog for the first time. Drew him skating and then drew him lying on Eliott&rsquo;s bed. Drew him as he saw Lucas, small, cute, but fierce and passionate and surprising. And, at the end of the night, Eliott hung those drawing on his wall, let his hedgehog join all the other animals that were already there.</p><p>Let the drawings join the representation of the people who were the most important to Eliott.</p><hr><p>\n\n<b><b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/184834595966/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-9-elu\">Chapter 9</a></b></b>\n\n\n| <b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/185344651031/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-10-elu\">Chapter 10</a> \n\n\n</b><br/></p>",

He had a smile on his face and his hands inside his pockets, a grin that showed he knew he had startled Eliott and was actually proud of it stretching on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he greeted.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just have said that before scaring me?\u201d Eliott asked, amused.</p><p>Well,\u201c Lucas pretended to think. \"I could have, but where would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to Eliott and took his hands out from his pockets so that he could grab his backpack and take two chocolate bars from it.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, offering Eliott one of them. \u201cTo apologize for startling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Eliott raised an unimpressed eyebrow but grabbed the chocolate anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\"Lucas took a bite off of his own chocolate.</p><p>\"Home,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cI wanted to go to the park later, but I\u2019m a little too tired for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean,\u201d he nodded at his skateboard. \u201cIt can be tiring to hear all those kids screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a park, Lucas, kids use it to play. What were you expecting?\u201d Eliott laughed.</p><p>\u201cPeace and quiet,\u201d Lucas deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Where are you going?\u201d Eliott asked while opening his chocolate bar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I was going home, too, but Mika, one of my roommates, apparently has someone over. If you know what I mean,\u201d he wrinkled his nose. \u201cManon was kind enough to tell me I was better outside the flat for now.\u201d</p><p>Eliott snorted, not envying Lucas\u2019 situation but finding it quite amusing nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cYou live with roommates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, two of them. Manon used to live with us too but it was tight fitting and she ended up moving next door.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked a bit torn about talking about his living situation and Eliott wondered if there was something more behind it and whether he should ask about it or not. In the end, he didn\u2019t have to choose because his bus was approaching them quickly and he had to stand up.</p><p>Eliott looked at Lucas and hesitated before saying goodbye to him. He didn\u2019t know if it would be overstepping to ask him if he wanted to come with him, he wasn\u2019t really sure if they already were close enough to warrant that invitation. But, the truth was, Eliott just wanted to spend more time with Lucas. And, all in all, he had no problem inviting him to spend time with him in his house. What was the worst that could happen, anyway? Lucas saying no?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d He asked before he could change his mind.</p><p>\u201cTo your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to impose,\u201d Lucas shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be inviting you if you were,\u201d he assured and added when he saw the bus stop in front of them. \u201cBesides, I want to spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up at him through his lashes, eyes alight with curiosity and wonder. Eliott had never seen anything as beautiful before.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Lucas smiled.</p><p>He got up and grabbed both his backpack and skateboard before turning to Eliott with trusting eyes and following him to where the bus\u2019 door was opening.</p><p>***</p><p>Eliott had never minded having friends over. Sofiane and Idriss and even Alex came over enough times for him to get used to it, but there was something different about this. Opening the door to Lucas wasn\u2019t the same thing as opening the door to one of his other friends. And guiding Lucas to his room, with a hand on the small of his back, felt like much more than simply showing a friend the way around his house.</p><p>He stopped by the kitchen to get something for them to drink and eat and watched, endeared, as Lucas stood on the doorway looking a little out of place. Eliott would make sure that by the time he left today he would feel comfortable enough to want to return.</p><p>In Eliott\u2019s room, he opened the beers that he had brought for them and put them and the snack on top of his desk. Lucas put his skateboard at the corner of Eliott\u00a1s room, right next to where his guitar was resting. Then, he took off his backpack and threw them to Eliott\u2019s chair.</p><p>The sight of the skateboard resting next to his guitar send something warm running down Eliott\u2019s body. They had met through those two things and having them in here, in his room, one next to the other, seemed to confirm that Eliott and Lucas had come together and where now closer, were friends and still getting to know each other. Still <i>interested</i>.</p><p>Eliott waited as Lucas looked around his room and absorbed what he saw. He seemed the most interested in the drawings Eliott had on his walls and Eliott had never before felt both this proud and this unguarded at the same time. The drawings were such an important part of him that he felt exposed every time someone saw them.</p><p>\u201cDid you draw them?\u201d Lucas asked, eyes still full of wonder and curiosity like Eliott loved to see.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eliott nodded, turning to look at the drawings too. \u201cI\u2019ve been drawing myself for years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe raccoon,\u201d Eliott pointed at the drawings. \u201cIt\u2019s my spirit animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour spirit animal?\u201d He raised an eyebrow as if the words made no sense in his head.</p><p>\u201cYes. You know, an animal I identify myself with?\u201d Eliott tensed up, not sure if Lucas was going to find it stupid and want to leave or not.</p><p>He looked up. Lucas still didn\u2019t look too convinced and there was still a slightly confused expression on his face and that worried Eliott. Just a little, though. Because there was also fondness in his eyes and that put a stop to Eliott\u2019s worries more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends and family. Sofiane is the quokka and Idriss is the tiger,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe bear is my mom and the coyote is my dad. The hummingbird is my little cousin. And Alex is the wolf.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed pensive, his eyes trained to the drawings with a slightly dazzled expression on his face. The blatant display of how impressed he was by Eliott thinking so deeply about the important people in his life he was showing blew Eliott away. He wasn\u2019t expecting Lucas to feel like that about his drawings at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Lucas said suddenly, eyes darting between the drawings on the wall and Eliott\u2019s own eyes, tone a mix of shy and challenging. \u201cHow would you draw me?\u201d</p><p>Eliott turned to look fully at him, all his attention on Lucas and what he had just said. Lucas\u2019 question had taken him by surprise. The implication behind it making Eliott\u2019s heart beat faster. Lucas wanted Eliott to consider drawing him, wanted to be important enough in Eliott\u2019s life to warrant a place on his wall of drawings.</p><p>And Eliott couldn\u2019t help but take in all of the boy in front of him. Couldn\u2019t help but look at him from his head to his feet and think about all the small things about Lucas he had discovered in the short time he had known him. Couldn\u2019t help but want the same thing Lucas did.</p><p>Eliott wanted to draw him and put the drawing on his wall, because Lucas was rapidly becoming a very important person in his life.</p><p>And maybe Eliott already knew how he would be drawing Lucas. He thought back to the basketball game, to the way Lucas had been spiky and defensive but also playful and happy, then, Eliott looked at Lucas\u2019 hair again and the image was more than clear in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said anyway. \u201cI\u2019d have to get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised both his eyebrows mischievously and grabbed his beer before sitting on Eliott\u2019s bed. Eliott took a second before following his lead and sitting next to him with his own drink in hand, glad to see that Lucas already seemed more comfortable in his house or, at least, in his room.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lucas started. \u201cOn top of being amazing at playing the guitar, you\u2019re also talented at drawing?\u201d</p><p>Eliott felt his face grow hot and he gripped the bottle in his hand tighter. As much as he appreciated getting complimented, he had never really known how to react in the face of one and, getting not one but two compliments in one sentence from Lucas, of all people, seemed like a completely different scenario he had never had to deal with.</p><p>\u201cI- Thank you,\u201d Eliott said, taking a gulp of his beer.</p><p>Lucas smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNo need to get flustered. I\u2019m just saying the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Eliott grumbled, pushing his arm playfully.</p><p>Lucas laughed and looked around the room before turning his eyes to Eliott again.</p><p>\u201cI missed you at the park yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d Eliott looked at him too. \u201cI went shopping with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll forgive you this time then,\u201d Lucas teased.</p><p>They finished their beers among teasing words and casual touches, jumping from topic to topic without focusing too much on anything. It was very laid back and Eliott was happy, if not slightly surprised, to see that he already felt as comfortable with Lucas, who he had met a few weeks ago, as he felt with some of his friends that he had known longer.</p><p>When they finished their drinks, Eliott took both bottles and put them on top of his desk again.</p><p>The sight of Lucas, laying on his back on Eliott\u2019s bed with his legs dangling from the bottom of it, made Eliott\u2019s heart race with the possibility of more afternoons spent like this.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there?\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice interrupted his musings.</p><p>Eliott shook his head before moving to his bed and sitting with his back against the headboard, Lucas\u2019 head near his knees.</p><p>\u201cDo you always draw what happens in your life?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>He seemed curious, interested in what Eliott had to say and, although Eliott wasn\u2019t sure where this conversation would end up, he couldn\u2019t just not answer Lucas.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something that feels important one way or the other, I usually draw it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned around in the bed so that he was stomach down, legs kicked up and with his head resting on his hands, facing Eliott.</p><p>\u201cOne way or the other?\u201d</p><p>Eliott chuckled, looked at his wall and then back at Lucas.</p><p>\u201cDespite what my walls might say, I don\u2019t draw only the good things.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded in understanding and, to Eliott\u2019s surprise, added.</p><p>\u201cDo you burn the ones about bad things?\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinked.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lucas seemed to hesitate slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that- When I was younger, and even now sometimes, I used to write down what I was feeling and what had happened when I wasn\u2019t feeling my best. And then I burned the paper. I- just thought that maybe you could have the same coping mechanism.\u201d</p><p>He fidgeted a little with his hands, looking down at Eliott\u2019s bed, looking the most insecure Eliott had ever seen him. Eliott wanted to ease his worries away, take the frown away from his face and stop the thoughts of regret that were surely swirling inside Lucas\u2019 head. He knew how hard it was to talk about things that were personal and he felt honoured that Lucas had felt comfortable enough to share with him something that he didn\u2019t go around telling just about anyone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn them, though sometimes there\u2019s nothing I want to do more than that,\u201d Eliott said, trying to meet Lucas\u2019 eyes, but he wouldn\u2019t look up. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t do something similar.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to do the trick and Lucas looked back up at Eliott.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you do?\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed, looking him in the eye and considered his options. He could just tell Lucas how he coped and end the conversation there, he knew Lucas wouldn\u2019t press for more and they could move onto easier waters, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted that. Because he had another option, he could open up to Lucas. He could tell him what he did <i>and </i>explain to him what was behind it, bring the past up and talk about it. And he felt like he could trust Lucas, he felt safe with him.</p><p>He got up, ignoring Lucas\u2019 small surprise noise at the sudden movement, and crouched next to the bed. He reached under it and stopped to stare at Lucas again when his fingers touched the lid of the box he kept there.</p><p>\u201cI keep all of the drawings about the bad days,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep them hidden in this box and never really look at them or share them with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sat up straighter and Eliott got back on the bed and put the black box between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly burning,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cBut I guess it does the same job.\u201d</p><p>Eliott took a breathe and moved to open the box.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me anything,\u201d Lucas rushed out, hands flying to grip Eliott\u2019s wrists. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very private. You don\u2019t have to, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 eyes met his and Eliott saw how worried he was that Eliott was going to do or say something he didn\u2019t actually want to. He could see that Lucas hadn\u2019t said anything with the intent to pry into Eliott\u2019s life. And that made it for Eliott. He wanted to open up to Lucas, he wanted to talk to him about what haunted him and what made him <i>Eliott</i>, and he knew that Lucas would listen to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly sure why he wanted to talk about his feeling all of a sudden, but he knew that it was probably because the person in front of him was Lucas. They hadn\u2019t met that long ago, but Eliott wanted to learn things about Lucas and let Lucas learn things about himself. It was a desire he couldn\u2019t quite explain, but it was there and it felt <i>right </i>and Eliott wouldn\u2019t let it get away.</p><p>Eliott smiled reassuringly at Lucas and released his hands from his grip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that sometimes it\u2019s good to talk,\u201d he made eye contact with Lucas to show he was serious before adding. \u201cSome people are worth opening up to.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed to be reassured by that, his hands dropped to his thighs and he licked his lips, eyes never leaving Eliott\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAm I one of those people?\u201d He asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Eliott said simply.</p><p>Lucas shuddered, his breath coming out shaky. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face for a fleeting moment, betraying how shocked he seemed to be that Eliott could think about him that way.</p><p>Instead of saying anything else to reassure Lucas that he was indeed the kind of person Eliott wanted to get to know and let into his life, he simply took the lid off of the black box and searched for the right drawings to start telling Lucas his story.</p><p>The first drawing he took off of the box was that of a little kid looking from the outside as four other kids played football together. Eliott smiled sadly down at it and caressed the paper with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t always draw people as their spirit animal,\u201d Eliott said. \u201cThat started later. Before, I actually used to draw the human figure as it is. Not that I was ever as good at drawing people as I am at drawing animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this drawing in the box?\u201d Lucas asked, voice soft and serious.</p><p>Once again, Lucas said exactly the words Eliott needed to hear. A simple question, but the words that showed that he understood Eliott and wanted to know more. The words that only came to confirm that Lucas was exactly the person Eliott by his side.</p><p>\u201cWhen I drew that, I was feeling alone,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe other kids are Sofiane, Idriss and two other guys who I haven\u2019t seen in forever. We were always playing together, but, at one point, I started feeling like I was just there. Outside, looking in, you know? I was probably about eleven?\u201d Eliott shook his head, unsure about the actual age or date. \u201cIt was when things started going downhill for me.\u201d</p><p>Eliott took a breath, lost in the memories of the times when he felt like an outsider in his own life. He knew now that it was all in his head, but it still had felt real at the time and it had marked him enough to put on paper.</p><p>He wished he could say that things went better for him after that, but, the truth was, the box in front of him had many more drawings inside and that was enough to prove that things hadn\u2019t really gotten easier. On the contrary, in fact.</p><p>\u201cThings only got worse after that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started drawing the spirit animals.\u201d</p><p>He paused, grabbing the one he wanted to show Lucas next.</p><p>\u201cWe learned about animals in class when I was twelve. It kind of made me go on a spiral of research. I wanted to know everything about them and then I stumbled upon the words \u2018spirit animal\u2019,\u201d he told Lucas. \u201cAnd then I did some research on that, too. Gave spirit animals to myself and to the people who were important to me.\u201d</p><p>He gave the drawing to Lucas. Little raccoon ears peaking from the top of a stone wall.</p><p>\u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t really talk to anyone or trust anyone at the time. It was as if there was something separating me from the rest of the world. And, by shutting everyone out, I felt a little bit safer. It was just me,\u201d he pointed to the drawing. \u201cMe and my wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d Lucas breathed out, sounding unsure about what he should say.</p><p>Eliott just smiled at him and shook his head, reaching out to squeeze one of Lucas\u2019 hands in reassurance. He didn\u2019t need him to say anything. Having him there, listening and showing interest in knowing this part of Eliott meant more to him than any words ever could.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said just to make sure Lucas knew.</p><p>He reached for the next drawing and hesitated. This was when, ironically since it had been such a dark time in his life, things really became clear. If he shared this with Lucas now, there would be no going back, no <i>hiding</i>.</p><p>One look at Lucas\u2019 open, tender, supportive expression was all it took to ease Eliott\u2019s worries.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was thirteen, I went through one of the worst periods in my life.\u201d</p><p>He heard Lucas gasp, a sound that showed his fear and worry about what Eliott was about to tell him. It warmed Eliott up to know that he cared enough despite the small amount of time they had known each other, to sit through this conversation and listen to it with interest and worry and just <i>care</i>.</p><p>He gave him the drawing. A raccoon hidden behind way too many lines scattered around, frantic and uneven and chaotic. His mind had been a mess and that had been the only way to properly show it on the paper.</p><p>\u201cThings didn\u2019t make sense. I spent weeks feeling amazing and then, all of sudden, I just wanted to lay in bed and sleep. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening and the confusion only made everything worse, because I understood that it wasn\u2019t natural to feel like that, not to that extent at least,\u201d he sighed, eyes shifting to the wall and becoming unfocused. \u201cEventually, after a week of almost no sleep at all and spending every hour researching, followed by a week when I just wanted to sleep, my parents took me to a professional.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed to be on the edge of his seat, ready to know and take in whatever Eliott was going to tell him.</p><p>Eliott looked into Lucas\u2019 eyes again. Yes, it was easier to open up when he was staring at a wall, but a wall was nothing when compared to Lucas\u2019 eyes. With his eyes locked on Lucas\u2019, Eliott found the courage he needed to say what he never really told that many people, the part of him he preferred to keep hidden most of the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bipolar.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence. Lucas blinked at him, inclined his head to one side with a thoughtful look in his eyes. And then he smiled, a small smile that made the tension that had settled on Eliott\u2019s shoulders dissipate.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t leaving. He wasn\u2019t running for the hills and never talking to him anymore. He was still here.</p><p>Lucas shifted the box to one side so that he could move closer to Eliott. He kneed in front of him, sitting on his heels and looking at Eliott with a soft look on his face that gave him the confidence to continue.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not easy to deal with me,\u201d Eliott said. \u201cThere\u2019s times when I can\u2019t leave my bed and times when I\u2019m overhyper and will do anything. Sometimes I cry and scream and yell for no reason. I\u2019m always afraid that I will hurt someone I care about without meaning to. It\u2019s quite hard a lot of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d Lucas raised a hand to rest on Eliott\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>Eliott licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>\u201cI- Not that many people know.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lowered his head a little, a signal of reverence that no one had ever shown Eliott.</p><p>\u201cI feel honoured, then.\u201d</p><p>Eliott felt a blush creeping up his cheeks at Lucas\u2019 words and his intense stare. It seemed he was looking straight into Eliott\u2019s soul and make sure every last part of Eliott knew he was there, proud and happy and <i>enamoured</i>. That was one word Eliott had never expected to use to describe the way someone stared at him, but it was the only one that seemed to fit properly the depth of Lucas\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cI started playing guitar around that time. Music always helped ground me a little, in a way, and I told my therapist that once. She told me that maybe actually making music could be great for me and to try it out,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI did and it was the best thing I could have done. I haven\u2019t stopped since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d Lucas whispered in the space between them, thumb caressing Eliott\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing and that was what mesmerized me about you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Eliott bit his lip. Lucas felt the same, he was sure of it. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and he never wanted Lucas to leave his bed, never really wanted him to be farther away from him than he was right now. And he wanted to make sure Lucas knew that. So, he leaned in a little, Lucas\u2019 hand falling from his cheek to the side of his neck and kissed Lucas\u2019 cheek gently, feeling it warm up against his lips with Lucas\u2019 blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mesmerized by you too,\u201d he breathed out, lips still touching Lucas\u2019 skin.</p><p>He felt Lucas\u2019 answering shudder and leaned back again to look at his face. He was blushing, but there was a happy smile on his face and Eliott felt his lips stretch into an answering grin. This was all Eliott wanted.</p><p>Then, still wanting Lucas to know more, Eliott showed him other drawings he found important to the story he was trying to tell. Images of raccons, mostly alone or clearly separated from quokkas, tigers, bears and coyotes. Pictures of loneliness, sadness and helplessness. Reaching low lows, coming up for air and breathing only to go down again and almost suffocate in chaotic thoughts. A raccoon, smaller than ever before, looking at an intimately big building, failing school having taken its toll on him. The aftermath of that, with the months of blame and guilt and disappointment and then breathing again like resurfacing.</p><p>When Eliott finished his story, the box was sitting on the floor and Eliott and Lucas were laying on the bed, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy that you told me so much about yourself,\u201d Lucas said, turning his head to stare at the side of Eliott\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m serious. It means a lot that you trusted me enough to tell me these personal things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an easy person to trust,\u201d Eliott turned his head too. \u201cAnd I did want to trust you. I want to get to know you. And I want you to get to know me; all of me. Even the shitty parts.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head and turned on his side so his whole body was facing Eliott.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing shitty about you, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed, happiness and peace coursing through his veins and leaving a warm trail behind. He felt so at ease and so relaxed with Lucas laying next to him as if nothing could touch him or hurt him. As if he was exactly where he should be, where he belonged. He reached down and grabbed Lucas\u2019 hand, squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cThank you for listening to me-\u201d Eliott started saying but Lucas interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. You deserve to be listened to. And besides,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI also want to know everything about you, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out his name like it was too precious to be said any louder or any less carefully. And then he leaned in and kissed his forehead, Eliott felt his smile on his skin and exhaled, his breath hitting Lucas\u2019 neck and making him shiver slightly.</p><p>Eliott never wanted this moment to end. He never wanted to let go of Lucas, but he knew, logically, that he would eventually have to, since the afternoon would turn into night. So, he just reached out, wrapped his arms around Lucas and brought him closer to him. Felt Lucas hug him back and kiss his collarbone softly, gentle lips and gentle breath.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t let go until Lucas\u2019 phone vibrated and he had to leave and, even then, it was a struggle unwrap his arms from around him.</p><p>After Lucas left, Eliott sat at his desk with the smell of Lucas\u2019 cologne clinging slightly to his hoodie and started drawing.</p><p>He drew a hedgehog for the first time. Drew him skating and then drew him lying on Eliott\u2019s bed. Drew him as he saw Lucas, small, cute, but fierce and passionate and surprising. And, at the end of the night, Eliott hung those drawing on his wall, let his hedgehog join all the other animals that were already there.</p><p>Let the drawings join the representation of the people who were the most important to Eliott.</p><hr><p>\n\n<b><b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/184834595966/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-9-elu\">Chapter 9</a></b></b>\n\n\n| <b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/185344651031/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-10-elu\">Chapter 10</a> \n\n\n</b><br></p>",

Idriss and Sofiane had blown up the group chat trying to make plans for the weekend and Eliott was trying to decide whether or not he should bother reading the texts or if he should just ignore them.</p><p>Idriss was suggesting another basketball game since, according to him, they still had to defeat Imane\u2019s team. Eliott didn\u2019t really know if he would want to play again, he would much rather just sit this one out and simply watch. So, remembering what Alex had asked him when they had had lunch together, he that it would be a good idea to ask if his friends were willing to have someone else on their team.</p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>What if I asked a friend to take my place in the game?</i></p><p><b>Sofiane:</b></p><p><i>Does he know how to play?</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>Better than me, for sure</i></p><p><b>Idriss:</b></p><p><i>Then you will hear no complaints about him taking your place</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>I can feel the love</i></p><p><i>Tell me when the game is going to be so I can text him</i></p><p>He didn\u2019t get to see Idriss or Sofiane\u2019s answer because the sound of a backpack being dropped next to his feet startled him and made him look up.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Lucas was standing there in front of him, one foot on top of his skateboard and the other on the concrete. He had a smile on his face and his hands inside his pockets, a grin that showed he knew he had startled Eliott and was actually proud of it stretching on his lips.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he greeted.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just have said that before scaring me?\u201d Eliott asked, amused.</p><p>Well,\u201c Lucas pretended to think. \"I could have, but where would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to Eliott and took his hands out from his pockets so that he could grab his backpack and take two chocolate bars from it.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, offering Eliott one of them. \u201cTo apologize for startling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Eliott raised an unimpressed eyebrow but grabbed the chocolate anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\"Lucas took a bite off of his own chocolate.</p><p>\"Home,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cI wanted to go to the park later, but I\u2019m a little too tired for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean,\u201d he nodded at his skateboard. \u201cIt can be tiring to hear all those kids screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a park, Lucas, kids use it to play. What were you expecting?\u201d Eliott laughed.</p><p>\u201cPeace and quiet,\u201d Lucas deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Where are you going?\u201d Eliott asked while opening his chocolate bar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I was going home, too, but Mika, one of my roommates, apparently has someone over. If you know what I mean,\u201d he wrinkled his nose. \u201cManon was kind enough to tell me I was better outside the flat for now.\u201d</p><p>Eliott snorted, not envying Lucas\u2019 situation but finding it quite amusing nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cYou live with roommates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, two of them. Manon used to live with us too but it was tight fitting and she ended up moving next door.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked a bit torn about talking about his living situation and Eliott wondered if there was something more behind it and whether he should ask about it or not. In the end, he didn\u2019t have to choose because his bus was approaching them quickly and he had to stand up.</p><p>Eliott looked at Lucas and hesitated before saying goodbye to him. He didn\u2019t know if it would be overstepping to ask him if he wanted to come with him, he wasn\u2019t really sure if they already were close enough to warrant that invitation. But, the truth was, Eliott just wanted to spend more time with Lucas. And, all in all, he had no problem inviting him to spend time with him in his house. What was the worst that could happen, anyway? Lucas saying no?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d He asked before he could change his mind.</p><p>\u201cTo your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to impose,\u201d Lucas shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be inviting you if you were,\u201d he assured and added when he saw the bus stop in front of them. \u201cBesides, I want to spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas looked up at him through his lashes, eyes alight with curiosity and wonder. Eliott had never seen anything as beautiful before.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Lucas smiled.</p><p>He got up and grabbed both his backpack and skateboard before turning to Eliott with trusting eyes and following him to where the bus\u2019 door was opening.</p><p>***</p><p>Eliott had never minded having friends over. Sofiane and Idriss and even Alex came over enough times for him to get used to it, but there was something different about this. Opening the door to Lucas wasn\u2019t the same thing as opening the door to one of his other friends. And guiding Lucas to his room, with a hand on the small of his back, felt like much more than simply showing a friend the way around his house.</p><p>He stopped by the kitchen to get something for them to drink and eat and watched, endeared, as Lucas stood on the doorway looking a little out of place. Eliott would make sure that by the time he left today he would feel comfortable enough to want to return.</p><p>In Eliott\u2019s room, he opened the beers that he had brought for them and put them and the snack on top of his desk. Lucas put his skateboard at the corner of Eliott\u00a1s room, right next to where his guitar was resting. Then, he took off his backpack and threw them to Eliott\u2019s chair.</p><p>The sight of the skateboard resting next to his guitar send something warm running down Eliott\u2019s body. They had met through those two things and having them in here, in his room, one next to the other, seemed to confirm that Eliott and Lucas had come together and where now closer, were friends and still getting to know each other. Still <i>interested</i>.</p><p>Eliott waited as Lucas looked around his room and absorbed what he saw. He seemed the most interested in the drawings Eliott had on his walls and Eliott had never before felt both this proud and this unguarded at the same time. The drawings were such an important part of him that he felt exposed every time someone saw them.</p><p>\u201cDid you draw them?\u201d Lucas asked, eyes still full of wonder and curiosity like Eliott loved to see.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eliott nodded, turning to look at the drawings too. \u201cI\u2019ve been drawing myself for years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe raccoon,\u201d Eliott pointed at the drawings. \u201cIt\u2019s my spirit animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour spirit animal?\u201d He raised an eyebrow as if the words made no sense in his head.</p><p>\u201cYes. You know, an animal I identify myself with?\u201d Eliott tensed up, not sure if Lucas was going to find it stupid and want to leave or not.</p><p>He looked up. Lucas still didn\u2019t look too convinced and there was still a slightly confused expression on his face and that worried Eliott. Just a little, though. Because there was also fondness in his eyes and that put a stop to Eliott\u2019s worries more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends and family. Sofiane is the quokka and Idriss is the tiger,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe bear is my mom and the coyote is my dad. The hummingbird is my little cousin. And Alex is the wolf.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed pensive, his eyes trained to the drawings with a slightly dazzled expression on his face. The blatant display of how impressed he was by Eliott thinking so deeply about the important people in his life he was showing blew Eliott away. He wasn\u2019t expecting Lucas to feel like that about his drawings at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Lucas said suddenly, eyes darting between the drawings on the wall and Eliott\u2019s own eyes, tone a mix of shy and challenging. \u201cHow would you draw me?\u201d</p><p>Eliott turned to look fully at him, all his attention on Lucas and what he had just said. Lucas\u2019 question had taken him by surprise. The implication behind it making Eliott\u2019s heart beat faster. Lucas wanted Eliott to consider drawing him, wanted to be important enough in Eliott\u2019s life to warrant a place on his wall of drawings.</p><p>And Eliott couldn\u2019t help but take in all of the boy in front of him. Couldn\u2019t help but look at him from his head to his feet and think about all the small things about Lucas he had discovered in the short time he had known him. Couldn\u2019t help but want the same thing Lucas did.</p><p>Eliott wanted to draw him and put the drawing on his wall, because Lucas was rapidly becoming a very important person in his life.</p><p>And maybe Eliott already knew how he would be drawing Lucas. He thought back to the basketball game, to the way Lucas had been spiky and defensive but also playful and happy, then, Eliott looked at Lucas\u2019 hair again and the image was more than clear in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said anyway. \u201cI\u2019d have to get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>Lucas raised both his eyebrows mischievously and grabbed his beer before sitting on Eliott\u2019s bed. Eliott took a second before following his lead and sitting next to him with his own drink in hand, glad to see that Lucas already seemed more comfortable in his house or, at least, in his room.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lucas started. \u201cOn top of being amazing at playing the guitar, you\u2019re also talented at drawing?\u201d</p><p>Eliott felt his face grow hot and he gripped the bottle in his hand tighter. As much as he appreciated getting complimented, he had never really known how to react in the face of one and, getting not one but two compliments in one sentence from Lucas, of all people, seemed like a completely different scenario he had never had to deal with.</p><p>\u201cI- Thank you,\u201d Eliott said, taking a gulp of his beer.</p><p>Lucas smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNo need to get flustered. I\u2019m just saying the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Eliott grumbled, pushing his arm playfully.</p><p>Lucas laughed and looked around the room before turning his eyes to Eliott again.</p><p>\u201cI missed you at the park yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d Eliott looked at him too. \u201cI went shopping with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll forgive you this time then,\u201d Lucas teased.</p><p>They finished their beers among teasing words and casual touches, jumping from topic to topic without focusing too much on anything. It was very laid back and Eliott was happy, if not slightly surprised, to see that he already felt as comfortable with Lucas, who he had met a few weeks ago, as he felt with some of his friends that he had known longer.</p><p>When they finished their drinks, Eliott took both bottles and put them on top of his desk again.</p><p>The sight of Lucas, laying on his back on Eliott\u2019s bed with his legs dangling from the bottom of it, made Eliott\u2019s heart race with the possibility of more afternoons spent like this.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there?\u201d Lucas\u2019 voice interrupted his musings.</p><p>Eliott shook his head before moving to his bed and sitting with his back against the headboard, Lucas\u2019 head near his knees.</p><p>\u201cDo you always draw what happens in your life?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>He seemed curious, interested in what Eliott had to say and, although Eliott wasn\u2019t sure where this conversation would end up, he couldn\u2019t just not answer Lucas.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s something that feels important one way or the other, I usually draw it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas turned around in the bed so that he was stomach down, legs kicked up and with his head resting on his hands, facing Eliott.</p><p>\u201cOne way or the other?\u201d</p><p>Eliott chuckled, looked at his wall and then back at Lucas.</p><p>\u201cDespite what my walls might say, I don\u2019t draw only the good things.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded in understanding and, to Eliott\u2019s surprise, added.</p><p>\u201cDo you burn the ones about bad things?\u201d</p><p>Eliott blinked.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lucas seemed to hesitate slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that- When I was younger, and even now sometimes, I used to write down what I was feeling and what had happened when I wasn\u2019t feeling my best. And then I burned the paper. I- just thought that maybe you could have the same coping mechanism.\u201d</p><p>He fidgeted a little with his hands, looking down at Eliott\u2019s bed, looking the most insecure Eliott had ever seen him. Eliott wanted to ease his worries away, take the frown away from his face and stop the thoughts of regret that were surely swirling inside Lucas\u2019 head. He knew how hard it was to talk about things that were personal and he felt honoured that Lucas had felt comfortable enough to share with him something that he didn\u2019t go around telling just about anyone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t burn them, though sometimes there\u2019s nothing I want to do more than that,\u201d Eliott said, trying to meet Lucas\u2019 eyes, but he wouldn\u2019t look up. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t do something similar.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to do the trick and Lucas looked back up at Eliott.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you do?\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed, looking him in the eye and considered his options. He could just tell Lucas how he coped and end the conversation there, he knew Lucas wouldn\u2019t press for more and they could move onto easier waters, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted that. Because he had another option, he could open up to Lucas. He could tell him what he did <i>and </i>explain to him what was behind it, bring the past up and talk about it. And he felt like he could trust Lucas, he felt safe with him.</p><p>He got up, ignoring Lucas\u2019 small surprise noise at the sudden movement, and crouched next to the bed. He reached under it and stopped to stare at Lucas again when his fingers touched the lid of the box he kept there.</p><p>\u201cI keep all of the drawings about the bad days,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep them hidden in this box and never really look at them or share them with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Lucas sat up straighter and Eliott got back on the bed and put the black box between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly burning,\u201d Eliott shrugged. \u201cBut I guess it does the same job.\u201d</p><p>Eliott took a breathe and moved to open the box.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me anything,\u201d Lucas rushed out, hands flying to grip Eliott\u2019s wrists. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very private. You don\u2019t have to, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019 eyes met his and Eliott saw how worried he was that Eliott was going to do or say something he didn\u2019t actually want to. He could see that Lucas hadn\u2019t said anything with the intent to pry into Eliott\u2019s life. And that made it for Eliott. He wanted to open up to Lucas, he wanted to talk to him about what haunted him and what made him <i>Eliott</i>, and he knew that Lucas would listen to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t exactly sure why he wanted to talk about his feeling all of a sudden, but he knew that it was probably because the person in front of him was Lucas. They hadn\u2019t met that long ago, but Eliott wanted to learn things about Lucas and let Lucas learn things about himself. It was a desire he couldn\u2019t quite explain, but it was there and it felt <i>right </i>and Eliott wouldn\u2019t let it get away.</p><p>Eliott smiled reassuringly at Lucas and released his hands from his grip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that sometimes it\u2019s good to talk,\u201d he made eye contact with Lucas to show he was serious before adding. \u201cSome people are worth opening up to.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed to be reassured by that, his hands dropped to his thighs and he licked his lips, eyes never leaving Eliott\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAm I one of those people?\u201d He asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Eliott said simply.</p><p>Lucas shuddered, his breath coming out shaky. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face for a fleeting moment, betraying how shocked he seemed to be that Eliott could think about him that way.</p><p>Instead of saying anything else to reassure Lucas that he was indeed the kind of person Eliott wanted to get to know and let into his life, he simply took the lid off of the black box and searched for the right drawings to start telling Lucas his story.</p><p>The first drawing he took off of the box was that of a little kid looking from the outside as four other kids played football together. Eliott smiled sadly down at it and caressed the paper with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t always draw people as their spirit animal,\u201d Eliott said. \u201cThat started later. Before, I actually used to draw the human figure as it is. Not that I was ever as good at drawing people as I am at drawing animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this drawing in the box?\u201d Lucas asked, voice soft and serious.</p><p>Once again, Lucas said exactly the words Eliott needed to hear. A simple question, but the words that showed that he understood Eliott and wanted to know more. The words that only came to confirm that Lucas was exactly the person Eliott by his side.</p><p>\u201cWhen I drew that, I was feeling alone,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe other kids are Sofiane, Idriss and two other guys who I haven\u2019t seen in forever. We were always playing together, but, at one point, I started feeling like I was just there. Outside, looking in, you know? I was probably about eleven?\u201d Eliott shook his head, unsure about the actual age or date. \u201cIt was when things started going downhill for me.\u201d</p><p>Eliott took a breath, lost in the memories of the times when he felt like an outsider in his own life. He knew now that it was all in his head, but it still had felt real at the time and it had marked him enough to put on paper.</p><p>He wished he could say that things went better for him after that, but, the truth was, the box in front of him had many more drawings inside and that was enough to prove that things hadn\u2019t really gotten easier. On the contrary, in fact.</p><p>\u201cThings only got worse after that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started drawing the spirit animals.\u201d</p><p>He paused, grabbing the one he wanted to show Lucas next.</p><p>\u201cWe learned about animals in class when I was twelve. It kind of made me go on a spiral of research. I wanted to know everything about them and then I stumbled upon the words \u2018spirit animal\u2019,\u201d he told Lucas. \u201cAnd then I did some research on that, too. Gave spirit animals to myself and to the people who were important to me.\u201d</p><p>He gave the drawing to Lucas. Little raccoon ears peaking from the top of a stone wall.</p><p>\u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t really talk to anyone or trust anyone at the time. It was as if there was something separating me from the rest of the world. And, by shutting everyone out, I felt a little bit safer. It was just me,\u201d he pointed to the drawing. \u201cMe and my wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliott\u2026\u201d Lucas breathed out, sounding unsure about what he should say.</p><p>Eliott just smiled at him and shook his head, reaching out to squeeze one of Lucas\u2019 hands in reassurance. He didn\u2019t need him to say anything. Having him there, listening and showing interest in knowing this part of Eliott meant more to him than any words ever could.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said just to make sure Lucas knew.</p><p>He reached for the next drawing and hesitated. This was when, ironically since it had been such a dark time in his life, things really became clear. If he shared this with Lucas now, there would be no going back, no <i>hiding</i>.</p><p>One look at Lucas\u2019 open, tender, supportive expression was all it took to ease Eliott\u2019s worries.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was thirteen, I went through one of the worst periods in my life.\u201d</p><p>He heard Lucas gasp, a sound that showed his fear and worry about what Eliott was about to tell him. It warmed Eliott up to know that he cared enough despite the small amount of time they had known each other, to sit through this conversation and listen to it with interest and worry and just <i>care</i>.</p><p>He gave him the drawing. A raccoon hidden behind way too many lines scattered around, frantic and uneven and chaotic. His mind had been a mess and that had been the only way to properly show it on the paper.</p><p>\u201cThings didn\u2019t make sense. I spent weeks feeling amazing and then, all of sudden, I just wanted to lay in bed and sleep. I didn\u2019t understand what was happening and the confusion only made everything worse, because I understood that it wasn\u2019t natural to feel like that, not to that extent at least,\u201d he sighed, eyes shifting to the wall and becoming unfocused. \u201cEventually, after a week of almost no sleep at all and spending every hour researching, followed by a week when I just wanted to sleep, my parents took me to a professional.\u201d</p><p>Lucas seemed to be on the edge of his seat, ready to know and take in whatever Eliott was going to tell him.</p><p>Eliott looked into Lucas\u2019 eyes again. Yes, it was easier to open up when he was staring at a wall, but a wall was nothing when compared to Lucas\u2019 eyes. With his eyes locked on Lucas\u2019, Eliott found the courage he needed to say what he never really told that many people, the part of him he preferred to keep hidden most of the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bipolar.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of silence. Lucas blinked at him, inclined his head to one side with a thoughtful look in his eyes. And then he smiled, a small smile that made the tension that had settled on Eliott\u2019s shoulders dissipate.</p><p>Lucas wasn\u2019t leaving. He wasn\u2019t running for the hills and never talking to him anymore. He was still here.</p><p>Lucas shifted the box to one side so that he could move closer to Eliott. He kneed in front of him, sitting on his heels and looking at Eliott with a soft look on his face that gave him the confidence to continue.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not easy to deal with me,\u201d Eliott said. \u201cThere\u2019s times when I can\u2019t leave my bed and times when I\u2019m overhyper and will do anything. Sometimes I cry and scream and yell for no reason. I\u2019m always afraid that I will hurt someone I care about without meaning to. It\u2019s quite hard a lot of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d Lucas raised a hand to rest on Eliott\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>Eliott licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>\u201cI- Not that many people know.\u201d</p><p>Lucas lowered his head a little, a signal of reverence that no one had ever shown Eliott.</p><p>\u201cI feel honoured, then.\u201d</p><p>Eliott felt a blush creeping up his cheeks at Lucas\u2019 words and his intense stare. It seemed he was looking straight into Eliott\u2019s soul and make sure every last part of Eliott knew he was there, proud and happy and <i>enamoured</i>. That was one word Eliott had never expected to use to describe the way someone stared at him, but it was the only one that seemed to fit properly the depth of Lucas\u2019 eyes.</p><p>\u201cI started playing guitar around that time. Music always helped ground me a little, in a way, and I told my therapist that once. She told me that maybe actually making music could be great for me and to try it out,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI did and it was the best thing I could have done. I haven\u2019t stopped since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did,\u201d Lucas whispered in the space between them, thumb caressing Eliott\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing and that was what mesmerized me about you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Eliott bit his lip. Lucas felt the same, he was sure of it. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and he never wanted Lucas to leave his bed, never really wanted him to be farther away from him than he was right now. And he wanted to make sure Lucas knew that. So, he leaned in a little, Lucas\u2019 hand falling from his cheek to the side of his neck and kissed Lucas\u2019 cheek gently, feeling it warm up against his lips with Lucas\u2019 blush.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mesmerized by you too,\u201d he breathed out, lips still touching Lucas\u2019 skin.</p><p>He felt Lucas\u2019 answering shudder and leaned back again to look at his face. He was blushing, but there was a happy smile on his face and Eliott felt his lips stretch into an answering grin. This was all Eliott wanted.</p><p>Then, still wanting Lucas to know more, Eliott showed him other drawings he found important to the story he was trying to tell. Images of raccons, mostly alone or clearly separated from quokkas, tigers, bears and coyotes. Pictures of loneliness, sadness and helplessness. Reaching low lows, coming up for air and breathing only to go down again and almost suffocate in chaotic thoughts. A raccoon, smaller than ever before, looking at an intimately big building, failing school having taken its toll on him. The aftermath of that, with the months of blame and guilt and disappointment and then breathing again like resurfacing.</p><p>When Eliott finished his story, the box was sitting on the floor and Eliott and Lucas were laying on the bed, side by side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really happy that you told me so much about yourself,\u201d Lucas said, turning his head to stare at the side of Eliott\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m serious. It means a lot that you trusted me enough to tell me these personal things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an easy person to trust,\u201d Eliott turned his head too. \u201cAnd I did want to trust you. I want to get to know you. And I want you to get to know me; all of me. Even the shitty parts.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook his head and turned on his side so his whole body was facing Eliott.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing shitty about you, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>Eliott sighed, happiness and peace coursing through his veins and leaving a warm trail behind. He felt so at ease and so relaxed with Lucas laying next to him as if nothing could touch him or hurt him. As if he was exactly where he should be, where he belonged. He reached down and grabbed Lucas\u2019 hand, squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cThank you for listening to me-\u201d Eliott started saying but Lucas interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. You deserve to be listened to. And besides,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI also want to know everything about you, Eliott.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out his name like it was too precious to be said any louder or any less carefully. And then he leaned in and kissed his forehead, Eliott felt his smile on his skin and exhaled, his breath hitting Lucas\u2019 neck and making him shiver slightly.</p><p>Eliott never wanted this moment to end. He never wanted to let go of Lucas, but he knew, logically, that he would eventually have to, since the afternoon would turn into night. So, he just reached out, wrapped his arms around Lucas and brought him closer to him. Felt Lucas hug him back and kiss his collarbone softly, gentle lips and gentle breath.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t let go until Lucas\u2019 phone vibrated and he had to leave and, even then, it was a struggle unwrap his arms from around him.</p><p>After Lucas left, Eliott sat at his desk with the smell of Lucas\u2019 cologne clinging slightly to his hoodie and started drawing.</p><p>He drew a hedgehog for the first time. Drew him skating and then drew him lying on Eliott\u2019s bed. Drew him as he saw Lucas, small, cute, but fierce and passionate and surprising. And, at the end of the night, Eliott hung those drawing on his wall, let his hedgehog join all the other animals that were already there.</p><p>Let the drawings join the representation of the people who were the most important to Eliott.</p><hr><p>\n\n<b><b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/184834595966/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-9-elu\">Chapter 9</a></b></b>\n\n\n| <b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/185344651031/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-10-elu\">Chapter 10</a> \n\n\n</b><br></p>",

Idriss and Sofiane had blown up the group chat trying to make plans for the weekend and Eliott was trying to decide whether or not he should bother reading the texts or if he should just ignore them.</p><p>Idriss was suggesting another basketball game since, according to him, they still had to defeat Imane&rsquo;s team. Eliott didn&rsquo;t really know if he would want to play again, he would much rather just sit this one out and simply watch. So, remembering what Alex had asked him when they had had lunch together, he that it would be a good idea to ask if his friends were willing to have someone else on their team.</p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>What if I asked a friend to take my place in the game?</i></p><p><b>Sofiane:</b></p><p><i>Does he know how to play?</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>Better than me, for sure</i></p><p><b>Idriss:</b></p><p><i>Then you will hear no complaints about him taking your place</i></p><p><b>Eliott:</b></p><p><i>I can feel the love</i></p><p><i>Tell me when the game is going to be so I can text him</i></p><p>He didn&rsquo;t get to see Idriss or Sofiane&rsquo;s answer because the sound of a backpack being dropped next to his feet startled him and made him look up.</p><p>Lucas was standing there in front of him, one foot on top of his skateboard and the other on the concrete. He had a smile on his face and his hands inside his pockets, a grin that showed he knew he had startled Eliott and was actually proud of it stretching on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he greeted.</p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you just have said that before scaring me?&rdquo; Eliott asked, amused.</p><p>Well,&ldquo; Lucas pretended to think. \"I could have, but where would be the fun in that?&rdquo;</p><p>He sat down next to Eliott and took his hands out from his pockets so that he could grab his backpack and take two chocolate bars from it.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, offering Eliott one of them. &ldquo;To apologize for startling you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not like you&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; Eliott raised an unimpressed eyebrow but grabbed the chocolate anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?\"Lucas took a bite off of his own chocolate.</p><p>\"Home,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;I wanted to go to the park later, but I&rsquo;m a little too tired for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know what you mean,&rdquo; he nodded at his skateboard. &ldquo;It can be tiring to hear all those kids screaming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a park, Lucas, kids use it to play. What were you expecting?&rdquo; Eliott laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Peace and quiet,&rdquo; Lucas deadpanned.</p><p>&ldquo;And you? Where are you going?&rdquo; Eliott asked while opening his chocolate bar.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I was going home, too, but Mika, one of my roommates, apparently has someone over. If you know what I mean,&rdquo; he wrinkled his nose. &ldquo;Manon was kind enough to tell me I was better outside the flat for now.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott snorted, not envying Lucas&rsquo; situation but finding it quite amusing nonetheless.</p><p>&ldquo;You live with roommates?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, two of them. Manon used to live with us too but it was tight fitting and she ended up moving next door.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas looked a bit torn about talking about his living situation and Eliott wondered if there was something more behind it and whether he should ask about it or not. In the end, he didn&rsquo;t have to choose because his bus was approaching them quickly and he had to stand up.</p><p>Eliott looked at Lucas and hesitated before saying goodbye to him. He didn&rsquo;t know if it would be overstepping to ask him if he wanted to come with him, he wasn&rsquo;t really sure if they already were close enough to warrant that invitation. But, the truth was, Eliott just wanted to spend more time with Lucas. And, all in all, he had no problem inviting him to spend time with him in his house. What was the worst that could happen, anyway? Lucas saying no?</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to come with me?&rdquo; He asked before he could change his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;To your house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you want to,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to impose,&rdquo; Lucas shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be inviting you if you were,&rdquo; he assured and added when he saw the bus stop in front of them. &ldquo;Besides, I want to spend more time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas looked up at him through his lashes, eyes alight with curiosity and wonder. Eliott had never seen anything as beautiful before.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; Lucas smiled.</p><p>He got up and grabbed both his backpack and skateboard before turning to Eliott with trusting eyes and following him to where the bus&rsquo; door was opening.</p><p>***</p><p>Eliott had never minded having friends over. Sofiane and Idriss and even Alex came over enough times for him to get used to it, but there was something different about this. Opening the door to Lucas wasn&rsquo;t the same thing as opening the door to one of his other friends. And guiding Lucas to his room, with a hand on the small of his back, felt like much more than simply showing a friend the way around his house.</p><p>He stopped by the kitchen to get something for them to drink and eat and watched, endeared, as Lucas stood on the doorway looking a little out of place. Eliott would make sure that by the time he left today he would feel comfortable enough to want to return.</p><p>In Eliott&rsquo;s room, he opened the beers that he had brought for them and put them and the snack on top of his desk. Lucas put his skateboard at the corner of Eliott&iexcl;s room, right next to where his guitar was resting. Then, he took off his backpack and threw them to Eliott&rsquo;s chair.</p><p>The sight of the skateboard resting next to his guitar send something warm running down Eliott&rsquo;s body. They had met through those two things and having them in here, in his room, one next to the other, seemed to confirm that Eliott and Lucas had come together and where now closer, were friends and still getting to know each other. Still <i>interested</i>.</p><p>Eliott waited as Lucas looked around his room and absorbed what he saw. He seemed the most interested in the drawings Eliott had on his walls and Eliott had never before felt both this proud and this unguarded at the same time. The drawings were such an important part of him that he felt exposed every time someone saw them.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you draw them?&rdquo; Lucas asked, eyes still full of wonder and curiosity like Eliott loved to see.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Eliott nodded, turning to look at the drawings too. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been drawing myself for years now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The raccoon,&rdquo; Eliott pointed at the drawings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my spirit animal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your spirit animal?&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow as if the words made no sense in his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. You know, an animal I identify myself with?&rdquo; Eliott tensed up, not sure if Lucas was going to find it stupid and want to leave or not.</p><p>He looked up. Lucas still didn&rsquo;t look too convinced and there was still a slightly confused expression on his face and that worried Eliott. Just a little, though. Because there was also fondness in his eyes and that put a stop to Eliott&rsquo;s worries more than anything else.</p><p>&ldquo;And the other animals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends and family. Sofiane is the quokka and Idriss is the tiger,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The bear is my mom and the coyote is my dad. The hummingbird is my little cousin. And Alex is the wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed pensive, his eyes trained to the drawings with a slightly dazzled expression on his face. The blatant display of how impressed he was by Eliott thinking so deeply about the important people in his life he was showing blew Eliott away. He wasn&rsquo;t expecting Lucas to feel like that about his drawings at all.</p><p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; Lucas said suddenly, eyes darting between the drawings on the wall and Eliott&rsquo;s own eyes, tone a mix of shy and challenging. &ldquo;How would you draw me?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott turned to look fully at him, all his attention on Lucas and what he had just said. Lucas&rsquo; question had taken him by surprise. The implication behind it making Eliott&rsquo;s heart beat faster. Lucas wanted Eliott to consider drawing him, wanted to be important enough in Eliott&rsquo;s life to warrant a place on his wall of drawings.</p><p>And Eliott couldn&rsquo;t help but take in all of the boy in front of him. Couldn&rsquo;t help but look at him from his head to his feet and think about all the small things about Lucas he had discovered in the short time he had known him. Couldn&rsquo;t help but want the same thing Lucas did.</p><p>Eliott wanted to draw him and put the drawing on his wall, because Lucas was rapidly becoming a very important person in his life.</p><p>And maybe Eliott already knew how he would be drawing Lucas. He thought back to the basketball game, to the way Lucas had been spiky and defensive but also playful and happy, then, Eliott looked at Lucas&rsquo; hair again and the image was more than clear in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said anyway. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to get to know you better.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas raised both his eyebrows mischievously and grabbed his beer before sitting on Eliott&rsquo;s bed. Eliott took a second before following his lead and sitting next to him with his own drink in hand, glad to see that Lucas already seemed more comfortable in his house or, at least, in his room.</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Lucas started. &ldquo;On top of being amazing at playing the guitar, you&rsquo;re also talented at drawing?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott felt his face grow hot and he gripped the bottle in his hand tighter. As much as he appreciated getting complimented, he had never really known how to react in the face of one and, getting not one but two compliments in one sentence from Lucas, of all people, seemed like a completely different scenario he had never had to deal with.</p><p>&ldquo;I- Thank you,&rdquo; Eliott said, taking a gulp of his beer.</p><p>Lucas smiled at him.</p><p>&ldquo;No need to get flustered. I&rsquo;m just saying the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; Eliott grumbled, pushing his arm playfully.</p><p>Lucas laughed and looked around the room before turning his eyes to Eliott again.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you at the park yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you now?&rdquo; Eliott looked at him too. &ldquo;I went shopping with my mom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll forgive you this time then,&rdquo; Lucas teased.</p><p>They finished their beers among teasing words and casual touches, jumping from topic to topic without focusing too much on anything. It was very laid back and Eliott was happy, if not slightly surprised, to see that he already felt as comfortable with Lucas, who he had met a few weeks ago, as he felt with some of his friends that he had known longer.</p><p>When they finished their drinks, Eliott took both bottles and put them on top of his desk again.</p><p>The sight of Lucas, laying on his back on Eliott&rsquo;s bed with his legs dangling from the bottom of it, made Eliott&rsquo;s heart race with the possibility of more afternoons spent like this.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you just going to stand there?&rdquo; Lucas&rsquo; voice interrupted his musings.</p><p>Eliott shook his head before moving to his bed and sitting with his back against the headboard, Lucas&rsquo; head near his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you always draw what happens in your life?&rdquo; Lucas asked.</p><p>He seemed curious, interested in what Eliott had to say and, although Eliott wasn&rsquo;t sure where this conversation would end up, he couldn&rsquo;t just not answer Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s something that feels important one way or the other, I usually draw it.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas turned around in the bed so that he was stomach down, legs kicked up and with his head resting on his hands, facing Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;One way or the other?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott chuckled, looked at his wall and then back at Lucas.</p><p>&ldquo;Despite what my walls might say, I don&rsquo;t draw only the good things.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas nodded in understanding and, to Eliott&rsquo;s surprise, added.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you burn the ones about bad things?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Lucas seemed to hesitate slightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that- When I was younger, and even now sometimes, I used to write down what I was feeling and what had happened when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling my best. And then I burned the paper. I- just thought that maybe you could have the same coping mechanism.&rdquo;</p><p>He fidgeted a little with his hands, looking down at Eliott&rsquo;s bed, looking the most insecure Eliott had ever seen him. Eliott wanted to ease his worries away, take the frown away from his face and stop the thoughts of regret that were surely swirling inside Lucas&rsquo; head. He knew how hard it was to talk about things that were personal and he felt honoured that Lucas had felt comfortable enough to share with him something that he didn&rsquo;t go around telling just about anyone.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t burn them, though sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing I want to do more than that,&rdquo; Eliott said, trying to meet Lucas&rsquo; eyes, but he wouldn&rsquo;t look up. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t do something similar.&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed to do the trick and Lucas looked back up at Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it that you do?&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighed, looking him in the eye and considered his options. He could just tell Lucas how he coped and end the conversation there, he knew Lucas wouldn&rsquo;t press for more and they could move onto easier waters, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure if he wanted that. Because he had another option, he could open up to Lucas. He could tell him what he did <i>and </i>explain to him what was behind it, bring the past up and talk about it. And he felt like he could trust Lucas, he felt safe with him.</p><p>He got up, ignoring Lucas&rsquo; small surprise noise at the sudden movement, and crouched next to the bed. He reached under it and stopped to stare at Lucas again when his fingers touched the lid of the box he kept there.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep all of the drawings about the bad days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I keep them hidden in this box and never really look at them or share them with anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas sat up straighter and Eliott got back on the bed and put the black box between them.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly burning,&rdquo; Eliott shrugged. &ldquo;But I guess it does the same job.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott took a breathe and moved to open the box.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to show me anything,&rdquo; Lucas rushed out, hands flying to grip Eliott&rsquo;s wrists. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously very private. You don&rsquo;t have to, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas&rsquo; eyes met his and Eliott saw how worried he was that Eliott was going to do or say something he didn&rsquo;t actually want to. He could see that Lucas hadn&rsquo;t said anything with the intent to pry into Eliott&rsquo;s life. And that made it for Eliott. He wanted to open up to Lucas, he wanted to talk to him about what haunted him and what made him <i>Eliott</i>, and he knew that Lucas would listen to him.</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure why he wanted to talk about his feeling all of a sudden, but he knew that it was probably because the person in front of him was Lucas. They hadn&rsquo;t met that long ago, but Eliott wanted to learn things about Lucas and let Lucas learn things about himself. It was a desire he couldn&rsquo;t quite explain, but it was there and it felt <i>right </i>and Eliott wouldn&rsquo;t let it get away.</p><p>Eliott smiled reassuringly at Lucas and released his hands from his grip.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned that sometimes it&rsquo;s good to talk,&rdquo; he made eye contact with Lucas to show he was serious before adding. &ldquo;Some people are worth opening up to.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed to be reassured by that, his hands dropped to his thighs and he licked his lips, eyes never leaving Eliott&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Am I one of those people?&rdquo; He asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; Eliott said simply.</p><p>Lucas shuddered, his breath coming out shaky. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face for a fleeting moment, betraying how shocked he seemed to be that Eliott could think about him that way.</p><p>Instead of saying anything else to reassure Lucas that he was indeed the kind of person Eliott wanted to get to know and let into his life, he simply took the lid off of the black box and searched for the right drawings to start telling Lucas his story.</p><p>The first drawing he took off of the box was that of a little kid looking from the outside as four other kids played football together. Eliott smiled sadly down at it and caressed the paper with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t always draw people as their spirit animal,&rdquo; Eliott said. &ldquo;That started later. Before, I actually used to draw the human figure as it is. Not that I was ever as good at drawing people as I am at drawing animals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why is this drawing in the box?&rdquo; Lucas asked, voice soft and serious.</p><p>Once again, Lucas said exactly the words Eliott needed to hear. A simple question, but the words that showed that he understood Eliott and wanted to know more. The words that only came to confirm that Lucas was exactly the person Eliott by his side.</p><p>&ldquo;When I drew that, I was feeling alone,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The other kids are Sofiane, Idriss and two other guys who I haven&rsquo;t seen in forever. We were always playing together, but, at one point, I started feeling like I was just there. Outside, looking in, you know? I was probably about eleven?&rdquo; Eliott shook his head, unsure about the actual age or date. &ldquo;It was when things started going downhill for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott took a breath, lost in the memories of the times when he felt like an outsider in his own life. He knew now that it was all in his head, but it still had felt real at the time and it had marked him enough to put on paper.</p><p>He wished he could say that things went better for him after that, but, the truth was, the box in front of him had many more drawings inside and that was enough to prove that things hadn&rsquo;t really gotten easier. On the contrary, in fact.</p><p>&ldquo;Things only got worse after that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I started drawing the spirit animals.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, grabbing the one he wanted to show Lucas next.</p><p>&ldquo;We learned about animals in class when I was twelve. It kind of made me go on a spiral of research. I wanted to know everything about them and then I stumbled upon the words &lsquo;spirit animal&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told Lucas. &ldquo;And then I did some research on that, too. Gave spirit animals to myself and to the people who were important to me.&rdquo;</p><p>He gave the drawing to Lucas. Little raccoon ears peaking from the top of a stone wall.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t really talk to anyone or trust anyone at the time. It was as if there was something separating me from the rest of the world. And, by shutting everyone out, I felt a little bit safer. It was just me,&rdquo; he pointed to the drawing. &ldquo;Me and my wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eliott&hellip;&rdquo; Lucas breathed out, sounding unsure about what he should say.</p><p>Eliott just smiled at him and shook his head, reaching out to squeeze one of Lucas&rsquo; hands in reassurance. He didn&rsquo;t need him to say anything. Having him there, listening and showing interest in knowing this part of Eliott meant more to him than any words ever could.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said just to make sure Lucas knew.</p><p>He reached for the next drawing and hesitated. This was when, ironically since it had been such a dark time in his life, things really became clear. If he shared this with Lucas now, there would be no going back, no <i>hiding</i>.</p><p>One look at Lucas&rsquo; open, tender, supportive expression was all it took to ease Eliott&rsquo;s worries.</p><p>&ldquo;When I was thirteen, I went through one of the worst periods in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard Lucas gasp, a sound that showed his fear and worry about what Eliott was about to tell him. It warmed Eliott up to know that he cared enough despite the small amount of time they had known each other, to sit through this conversation and listen to it with interest and worry and just <i>care</i>.</p><p>He gave him the drawing. A raccoon hidden behind way too many lines scattered around, frantic and uneven and chaotic. His mind had been a mess and that had been the only way to properly show it on the paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Things didn&rsquo;t make sense. I spent weeks feeling amazing and then, all of sudden, I just wanted to lay in bed and sleep. I didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening and the confusion only made everything worse, because I understood that it wasn&rsquo;t natural to feel like that, not to that extent at least,&rdquo; he sighed, eyes shifting to the wall and becoming unfocused. &ldquo;Eventually, after a week of almost no sleep at all and spending every hour researching, followed by a week when I just wanted to sleep, my parents took me to a professional.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas seemed to be on the edge of his seat, ready to know and take in whatever Eliott was going to tell him.</p><p>Eliott looked into Lucas&rsquo; eyes again. Yes, it was easier to open up when he was staring at a wall, but a wall was nothing when compared to Lucas&rsquo; eyes. With his eyes locked on Lucas&rsquo;, Eliott found the courage he needed to say what he never really told that many people, the part of him he preferred to keep hidden most of the time.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bipolar.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a beat of silence. Lucas blinked at him, inclined his head to one side with a thoughtful look in his eyes. And then he smiled, a small smile that made the tension that had settled on Eliott&rsquo;s shoulders dissipate.</p><p>Lucas wasn&rsquo;t leaving. He wasn&rsquo;t running for the hills and never talking to him anymore. He was still here.</p><p>Lucas shifted the box to one side so that he could move closer to Eliott. He kneed in front of him, sitting on his heels and looking at Eliott with a soft look on his face that gave him the confidence to continue.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s not easy to deal with me,&rdquo; Eliott said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s times when I can&rsquo;t leave my bed and times when I&rsquo;m overhyper and will do anything. Sometimes I cry and scream and yell for no reason. I&rsquo;m always afraid that I will hurt someone I care about without meaning to. It&rsquo;s quite hard a lot of the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me,&rdquo; Lucas raised a hand to rest on Eliott&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t easy.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott licked his lips, mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>&ldquo;I- Not that many people know.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas lowered his head a little, a signal of reverence that no one had ever shown Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel honoured, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott felt a blush creeping up his cheeks at Lucas&rsquo; words and his intense stare. It seemed he was looking straight into Eliott&rsquo;s soul and make sure every last part of Eliott knew he was there, proud and happy and <i>enamoured</i>. That was one word Eliott had never expected to use to describe the way someone stared at him, but it was the only one that seemed to fit properly the depth of Lucas&rsquo; eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I started playing guitar around that time. Music always helped ground me a little, in a way, and I told my therapist that once. She told me that maybe actually making music could be great for me and to try it out,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;I did and it was the best thing I could have done. I haven&rsquo;t stopped since.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did,&rdquo; Lucas whispered in the space between them, thumb caressing Eliott&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing and that was what mesmerized me about you in the first place.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott bit his lip. Lucas felt the same, he was sure of it. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and he never wanted Lucas to leave his bed, never really wanted him to be farther away from him than he was right now. And he wanted to make sure Lucas knew that. So, he leaned in a little, Lucas&rsquo; hand falling from his cheek to the side of his neck and kissed Lucas&rsquo; cheek gently, feeling it warm up against his lips with Lucas&rsquo; blush.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mesmerized by you too,&rdquo; he breathed out, lips still touching Lucas&rsquo; skin.</p><p>He felt Lucas&rsquo; answering shudder and leaned back again to look at his face. He was blushing, but there was a happy smile on his face and Eliott felt his lips stretch into an answering grin. This was all Eliott wanted.</p><p>Then, still wanting Lucas to know more, Eliott showed him other drawings he found important to the story he was trying to tell. Images of raccons, mostly alone or clearly separated from quokkas, tigers, bears and coyotes. Pictures of loneliness, sadness and helplessness. Reaching low lows, coming up for air and breathing only to go down again and almost suffocate in chaotic thoughts. A raccoon, smaller than ever before, looking at an intimately big building, failing school having taken its toll on him. The aftermath of that, with the months of blame and guilt and disappointment and then breathing again like resurfacing.</p><p>When Eliott finished his story, the box was sitting on the floor and Eliott and Lucas were laying on the bed, side by side.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really happy that you told me so much about yourself,&rdquo; Lucas said, turning his head to stare at the side of Eliott&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. It means a lot that you trusted me enough to tell me these personal things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an easy person to trust,&rdquo; Eliott turned his head too. &ldquo;And I did want to trust you. I want to get to know you. And I want you to get to know me; all of me. Even the shitty parts.&rdquo;</p><p>Lucas shook his head and turned on his side so his whole body was facing Eliott.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing shitty about you, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>Eliott sighed, happiness and peace coursing through his veins and leaving a warm trail behind. He felt so at ease and so relaxed with Lucas laying next to him as if nothing could touch him or hurt him. As if he was exactly where he should be, where he belonged. He reached down and grabbed Lucas&rsquo; hand, squeezing it.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you for listening to me-&rdquo; Eliott started saying but Lucas interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me. You deserve to be listened to. And besides,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;I also want to know everything about you, Eliott.&rdquo;</p><p>He breathed out his name like it was too precious to be said any louder or any less carefully. And then he leaned in and kissed his forehead, Eliott felt his smile on his skin and exhaled, his breath hitting Lucas&rsquo; neck and making him shiver slightly.</p><p>Eliott never wanted this moment to end. He never wanted to let go of Lucas, but he knew, logically, that he would eventually have to, since the afternoon would turn into night. So, he just reached out, wrapped his arms around Lucas and brought him closer to him. Felt Lucas hug him back and kiss his collarbone softly, gentle lips and gentle breath.</p><p>And he didn&rsquo;t let go until Lucas&rsquo; phone vibrated and he had to leave and, even then, it was a struggle unwrap his arms from around him.</p><p>After Lucas left, Eliott sat at his desk with the smell of Lucas&rsquo; cologne clinging slightly to his hoodie and started drawing.</p><p>He drew a hedgehog for the first time. Drew him skating and then drew him lying on Eliott&rsquo;s bed. Drew him as he saw Lucas, small, cute, but fierce and passionate and surprising. And, at the end of the night, Eliott hung those drawing on his wall, let his hedgehog join all the other animals that were already there.</p><p>Let the drawings join the representation of the people who were the most important to Eliott.</p><hr /><p>\n\n<b><b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/184834595966/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-9-elu\">Chapter 9</a></b></b>\n\n\n| <b><a href=\"https://classy5sos.tumblr.com/post/185344651031/between-skateboards-and-guitars-chapter-10-elu\">Chapter 10</a> \n\n\n</b><br /></p>",
