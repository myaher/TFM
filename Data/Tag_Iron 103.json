        "body": "<p>Tony Stark made sure to keep his kids out of the limelight when he was granted custody of them after their mother\u2019s death. The world knew very little of the Stark twins and Tony wanted to keep it that way. For the most part they knew one was a genius and the other was daddy\u2019s spoiled princess. But when Tony starts acting out of control , the twins are thrown in the middle of the crossfire , allowing the world to really see them. They now have to make a choice that will change their lives forever.</p><p>After the battle in New York , you weren\u2019t expecting things to go back to normal but you certainly weren\u2019t expecting them to go to shit so fast. Your dad was suffering from PTSD. And even months after Loki brainwashing you with the scepter you were still suffering from it\u2019s effects. Will you let your emotions get the best of you and your abilities? How can you keep yourself and your dad from going completely off the rails?</p><p>A/N : GIF not mine.

You did little small hops in place as the simulation cleaned itself up and prepared a new one. You looked over towards the ocean and sighed when you noticed the sun beginning to rise from the horizon.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u201cY/N it\u2019s nearly 6 in the morning. May I suggest we take a break and head inside for some shut eye.\u201d Edwin Jarvis spoke. The list of what you could do continued to grow with each passing day as you explored your abilities. One was illusion casting. You\u2019ve never met him , in fact you never knew J.A.R.V.I.S the AI was paid homage to an actual person in your dad\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just start the simulation and record. Like I asked.\u201d You remarked , waiving your hand at him. You were aggravated and straight up tired. You haven\u2019t slept well in days since you learned to absorb your father\u2019s fears in to you. You started off small at first , to make sure you would be able to control it and then once you gotten used to it you absorbed it completely. You channeled that fear in to controlling your abilities. He\u2019s been sleeping like a baby ever since so you didn\u2019t mind it.\u00a0\u201cJarvis , I\u2019m sorry.\u201d You turned to face the illusion but he was already gone.\u00a0<br/></p><!-- more --><p>You let out a sigh and walked over to the little set up of the table that had the laptop and the figurine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for that thing everywhere!\u201d The familiar voice says just a few inches behind you and grabs the figurine.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing out here so early?\u201d Anthony says and helps you with the equipment.<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI was practicing.\u201d You quietly thank him and start heading back towards the house.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were hiding.\u201d He jokes. The two of you go down the tunnel leading towards the garage.<br/></p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe all know how well that worked out for me last time. Thanks for not having S.H.I.E.L.D come after me this time around.\u201d You joke back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done hiding. We\u2019ve both seen the kind of threats there are out there and what kind of horrible person would I be if I just stood by and let it happen knowing I can do what I do. That alien invasion really fucked with dad\u2019s head and truth be told it\u2019s fucking with mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fucking with you?\u201d You heard your dad\u2019s voice echo thru. He was in the middle of the garage testing another model of the Iron Man suit.\u00a0\u201cOh , hey Jr. Didn\u2019t know you were coming in.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He laughed in excitement. He set down the figurine on the garage floor and rushed over to your dad to check out the new suit.\u00a0\u201cMark 15? Where did you find the time to make 9 new suits?\u201d He looked up at your dad in shock then looked back at you. You had made yourself comfortable in his desk chair and simply shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIs someone gonna answer my question?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. I\u2019ve had a lot of free time on my hands.\u201d Your dad shrugs.\u00a0\u201cPepper\u2019s running the company , Happy\u2019s head of security and you kids are out doing your thing. I\u2019m just doing what I do best.\u201d Anthony looks up at your father confused.</p><p>\u201cTake that thing for a test run , huh dad? When you get back we\u2019ll have breakfast ready.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d He shuts the mask and waits for Anthony to move back ,\u00a0\u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d He calls out as he flies out the tunnel.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell? You wanna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain while we cook him some breakfast. Unless you want to deal with dad while he\u2019s hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019ve been <i>feeding</i> off his fear?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cNot feeding off of him. God , you make me sound like a cannibal. I\u2019ve just been removing that fear so he can sleep well. You should have seen him when I first got here. The man was a mess. Neck deep with designs on new Iron Man suits and prototypes of things he thought I could use. He was up for days before I even got here. He wouldn\u2019t admit to it so I took matters in to my own hands.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBy deceiving him in to thinking he\u2019s getting better?\u201d You set the plate of pancakes down on the table. Anthony followed shortly after with a plates of bacon and hash.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d You justified. Anthony rolled his eyes not falling for the bullshit.\u00a0\u201cOK , you know what , sue me. He was using those machines as a distraction instead of addressing the problem. At least<i> I</i> had the decency to come check on him. Where the hell were you?!\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gone for one hour and you two are already going at it?\u201d Your dad is strolling in to the dining room in his day clothes now.\u00a0\u201cDo we need a time out shirt or do I need to go out and , I don\u2019t know , buy new kids?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked our bickering?\u201d You smirk.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll grab the plates. Coffee?\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat smells amazing!\u201d Your face lights up with happiness after hearing her voice. Pepper walks in to the dining room with a huge smile on her face. With Happy following right behind her.</p><p>\u201cPepper!\u201d You rush over to her and embrace her in a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were gonna be joining us.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You\u2019re across the country and you\u2019re finally all here together. I wasn\u2019t gonna miss out on spending time with my favorite kids.\u201d She smiles. Your dad clears his throat.\u00a0\u201cOh , hush you. I see you everyday. So what are we having?\u201d She walks across the dining room to join your dad and Anthony at the table and you continue towards the kitchen for the plate and utensils.<br/></p><p>\u201cTypical american breakfast. Go on , Happy , take a seat. We\u2019ve made enough to feed an entire village.\u201d You hear Anthony tell her. You set down the plates in front of everyone before taking a seat of your own.<br/></p><p>\u00a0That morning\u00a0 was filled with laughter , jokes and fun stories. It\u2019s been a while since you were surrounded by happiness and love , you almost forgot about all those nightmares and New York. Almost. But you weren\u2019t going to let that get in the way of enjoying your time with your family. Your dad was genuinely smiling and laughing with all of you , Happy was relaxed for once , and even with Stark Industries running smoothly\u00a0 you can tell Pepper was enjoying this time as well.\u00a0</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>\u00a0You slammed shut the dishwasher after loading it and let out a huge yawn. The excitement from earlier made you forget how tired you really were. But after scarfing down all that delicious food it was catching up with you again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo sleep again?\u201d Your dad nearly startled you. You wiped your hair out of your face and chuckled softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Slowly slipping in to a food coma.\u201d You lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh,\u00a0 Pepper left these for you. She was in a rush to get back to the company but she wanted to make sure you got them.\u201d He holds up a small stack of papers.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had a look at them and they\u2019re no Picasso but they are good.\u201d He jokes as you look thru each drawing. They were drawings of you in your combat gear. One alongside Iron Man and your brother in his lab coat with , what you could only assume were the Iron Man drones. Another one you were alongside the other Avengers. You looked over the others and you heart felt like it could just burst.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0You let out a small laugh when you saw the one of you next to Captain America standing on top of a small hill of Chitauri Aliens and a heart drawn in between the two of you.\u00a0\u201cThese are the cutest things I have ever seen.\u201d You tell him.</p><p>\u201cI hear Fury\u2019s been wanting you on the team.\u201d He casually leans back against the counter and folds his arms across his chest. You shake your head , folding the drawings in half and setting them down on the counter next to you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you gave these to me so you can help his case.\u201d You roll your eyes, \u201cAnd like I told him. I\u2019m not an Avenger. I just happen to be at the right place at the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s all it takes. I mean , you see how much the young ones look up to you. You saved thousands of people that day.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>nothing</i> compared to the millions you saved.\u201d You said without thinking. But to your surprise your dad didn\u2019t flinch at the subtle mention of flying thru the wormhole.\u00a0\u201cBesides,\u201d you quickly changed the subject.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to handle the pressure of saving the world all the time.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cCompared to the pressure of taking care of me? That\u2019s like a walk in the park.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t laugh along.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my dad. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m always gonna worry about you first.\u201d The smile he had on his face disappeared. You watched him as he let out a long sigh and pushed himself off the counter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your life to be all about worrying about me. To be honest I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t grown an ulcer from all the stress I\u2019ve put on you. Intentional or not.\u201d You opened your mouth to speak but he waved at you to be quiet,\u00a0\u201cjust hear me out. I know what you\u2019re doing here. I see what it\u2019s done to you because of me.\u00a0Honey , I love you.\u201d He walked the short distance to you as he spoke and placed his hands on your shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to grow up regretting not doing things you should\u2019ve at least taken a chance on. You\u2019re 20 years old and you\u2019re here with your old man. You know what I was doing when I was 20?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cCreating you and your brother.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd you said it.\u201d You roll your eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you want me to go out and reproduce?\u201d You chuckle.<br/></p><p>\u201cGod no!\u201d He gasps.\u00a0\u201cI just want you to go out and have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around taking care of me.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? If I didn\u2019t know any better I think you just want me outta here.\u201d\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d He raises his hands up.\u00a0\u201cI asked Pepper to move in and she agreed. We thought it was time.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd it is.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cYeah , ok. I get it.

The two of you go down the tunnel leading towards the garage.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe all know how well that worked out for me last time. Thanks for not having S.H.I.E.L.D come after me this time around.\u201d You joke back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done hiding. We\u2019ve both seen the kind of threats there are out there and what kind of horrible person would I be if I just stood by and let it happen knowing I can do what I do. That alien invasion really fucked with dad\u2019s head and truth be told it\u2019s fucking with mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fucking with you?\u201d You heard your dad\u2019s voice echo thru. He was in the middle of the garage testing another model of the Iron Man suit.\u00a0\u201cOh , hey Jr. Didn\u2019t know you were coming in.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He laughed in excitement. He set down the figurine on the garage floor and rushed over to your dad to check out the new suit.\u00a0\u201cMark 15? Where did you find the time to make 9 new suits?\u201d He looked up at your dad in shock then looked back at you. You had made yourself comfortable in his desk chair and simply shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIs someone gonna answer my question?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. I\u2019ve had a lot of free time on my hands.\u201d Your dad shrugs.\u00a0\u201cPepper\u2019s running the company , Happy\u2019s head of security and you kids are out doing your thing. I\u2019m just doing what I do best.\u201d Anthony looks up at your father confused.</p><p>\u201cTake that thing for a test run , huh dad? When you get back we\u2019ll have breakfast ready.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d He shuts the mask and waits for Anthony to move back ,\u00a0\u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d He calls out as he flies out the tunnel.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell? You wanna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain while we cook him some breakfast. Unless you want to deal with dad while he\u2019s hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0\u201cSo you\u2019ve been <i>feeding</i> off his fear?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cNot feeding off of him. God , you make me sound like a cannibal. I\u2019ve just been removing that fear so he can sleep well. You should have seen him when I first got here. The man was a mess. Neck deep with designs on new Iron Man suits and prototypes of things he thought I could use. He was up for days before I even got here. He wouldn\u2019t admit to it so I took matters in to my own hands.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBy deceiving him in to thinking he\u2019s getting better?\u201d You set the plate of pancakes down on the table. Anthony followed shortly after with a plates of bacon and hash.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d You justified. Anthony rolled his eyes not falling for the bullshit.\u00a0\u201cOK , you know what , sue me. He was using those machines as a distraction instead of addressing the problem. At least<i> I</i> had the decency to come check on him. Where the hell were you?!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gone for one hour and you two are already going at it?\u201d Your dad is strolling in to the dining room in his day clothes now.\u00a0\u201cDo we need a time out shirt or do I need to go out and , I don\u2019t know , buy new kids?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked our bickering?\u201d You smirk.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll grab the plates. Coffee?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat smells amazing!\u201d Your face lights up with happiness after hearing her voice. Pepper walks in to the dining room with a huge smile on her face. With Happy following right behind her.</p><p>\u201cPepper!\u201d You rush over to her and embrace her in a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were gonna be joining us.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You\u2019re across the country and you\u2019re finally all here together. I wasn\u2019t gonna miss out on spending time with my favorite kids.\u201d She smiles. Your dad clears his throat.\u00a0\u201cOh , hush you. I see you everyday. So what are we having?\u201d She walks across the dining room to join your dad and Anthony at the table and you continue towards the kitchen for the plate and utensils.<br></p><p>\u201cTypical american breakfast. Go on , Happy , take a seat. We\u2019ve made enough to feed an entire village.\u201d You hear Anthony tell her. You set down the plates in front of everyone before taking a seat of your own.<br></p><p>\u00a0That morning\u00a0 was filled with laughter , jokes and fun stories. It\u2019s been a while since you were surrounded by happiness and love , you almost forgot about all those nightmares and New York. Almost. But you weren\u2019t going to let that get in the way of enjoying your time with your family. Your dad was genuinely smiling and laughing with all of you , Happy was relaxed for once , and even with Stark Industries running smoothly\u00a0 you can tell Pepper was enjoying this time as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0You slammed shut the dishwasher after loading it and let out a huge yawn. The excitement from earlier made you forget how tired you really were. But after scarfing down all that delicious food it was catching up with you again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo sleep again?\u201d Your dad nearly startled you. You wiped your hair out of your face and chuckled softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Slowly slipping in to a food coma.\u201d You lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh,\u00a0 Pepper left these for you. She was in a rush to get back to the company but she wanted to make sure you got them.\u201d He holds up a small stack of papers.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had a look at them and they\u2019re no Picasso but they are good.\u201d He jokes as you look thru each drawing. They were drawings of you in your combat gear. One alongside Iron Man and your brother in his lab coat with , what you could only assume were the Iron Man drones. Another one you were alongside the other Avengers. You looked over the others and you heart felt like it could just burst.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0You let out a small laugh when you saw the one of you next to Captain America standing on top of a small hill of Chitauri Aliens and a heart drawn in between the two of you.\u00a0\u201cThese are the cutest things I have ever seen.\u201d You tell him.</p><p>\u201cI hear Fury\u2019s been wanting you on the team.\u201d He casually leans back against the counter and folds his arms across his chest. You shake your head , folding the drawings in half and setting them down on the counter next to you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you gave these to me so you can help his case.\u201d You roll your eyes, \u201cAnd like I told him. I\u2019m not an Avenger. I just happen to be at the right place at the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s all it takes. I mean , you see how much the young ones look up to you. You saved thousands of people that day.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>nothing</i> compared to the millions you saved.\u201d You said without thinking. But to your surprise your dad didn\u2019t flinch at the subtle mention of flying thru the wormhole.\u00a0\u201cBesides,\u201d you quickly changed the subject.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to handle the pressure of saving the world all the time.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCompared to the pressure of taking care of me? That\u2019s like a walk in the park.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t laugh along.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my dad. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m always gonna worry about you first.\u201d The smile he had on his face disappeared. You watched him as he let out a long sigh and pushed himself off the counter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your life to be all about worrying about me. To be honest I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t grown an ulcer from all the stress I\u2019ve put on you. Intentional or not.\u201d You opened your mouth to speak but he waved at you to be quiet,\u00a0\u201cjust hear me out. I know what you\u2019re doing here. I see what it\u2019s done to you because of me.\u00a0Honey , I love you.\u201d He walked the short distance to you as he spoke and placed his hands on your shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to grow up regretting not doing things you should\u2019ve at least taken a chance on. You\u2019re 20 years old and you\u2019re here with your old man. You know what I was doing when I was 20?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCreating you and your brother.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you said it.\u201d You roll your eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you want me to go out and reproduce?\u201d You chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cGod no!\u201d He gasps.\u00a0\u201cI just want you to go out and have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around taking care of me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? If I didn\u2019t know any better I think you just want me outta here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d He raises his hands up.\u00a0\u201cI asked Pepper to move in and she agreed. We thought it was time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd it is.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cYeah , ok. I get it. You two need your space.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHey , but you know you\u2019re always welcome here , right?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cOf course. Whatever\u2019s going on with you , just promise me you\u2019ll get the help you need. Don\u2019t let it get worse.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He holds his hand up as he says ,\u201dScout\u2019s honor.\u201d\u00a0</p><hr><p>( <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\">@lizlil</a>\u00a0 <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PolRizAJcdus9cxoyHNmw\">@moli1497</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQQ5Tf5-trZDfW6UpPzIBQ\">@1awesomeash</a> )</p>",

Like I asked.\u201d You remarked , waiving your hand at him. You were aggravated and straight up tired. You haven\u2019t slept well in days since you learned to absorb your father\u2019s fears in to you. You started off small at first , to make sure you would be able to control it and then once you gotten used to it you absorbed it completely. You channeled that fear in to controlling your abilities. He\u2019s been sleeping like a baby ever since so you didn\u2019t mind it.\u00a0\u201cJarvis , I\u2019m sorry.\u201d You turned to face the illusion but he was already gone.\u00a0<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>You let out a sigh and walked over to the little set up of the table that had the laptop and the figurine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for that thing everywhere!\u201d The familiar voice says just a few inches behind you and grabs the figurine.\u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing out here so early?\u201d Anthony says and helps you with the equipment.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cI was practicing.\u201d You quietly thank him and start heading back towards the house.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were hiding.\u201d He jokes. The two of you go down the tunnel leading towards the garage.<br></p><p>\u00a0\u201cWe all know how well that worked out for me last time. Thanks for not having S.H.I.E.L.D come after me this time around.\u201d You joke back.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done hiding. We\u2019ve both seen the kind of threats there are out there and what kind of horrible person would I be if I just stood by and let it happen knowing I can do what I do. That alien invasion really fucked with dad\u2019s head and truth be told it\u2019s fucking with mine.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fucking with you?\u201d You heard your dad\u2019s voice echo thru.

He set down the figurine on the garage floor and rushed over to your dad to check out the new suit.\u00a0\u201cMark 15? Where did you find the time to make 9 new suits?\u201d He looked up at your dad in shock then looked back at you. You had made yourself comfortable in his desk chair and simply shrugged.\u00a0\u201cIs someone gonna answer my question?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious.

God , you make me sound like a cannibal. I\u2019ve just been removing that fear so he can sleep well. You should have seen him when I first got here. The man was a mess. Neck deep with designs on new Iron Man suits and prototypes of things he thought I could use. He was up for days before I even got here. He wouldn\u2019t admit to it so I took matters in to my own hands.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBy deceiving him in to thinking he\u2019s getting better?\u201d You set the plate of pancakes down on the table. Anthony followed shortly after with a plates of bacon and hash.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing.\u201d You justified. Anthony rolled his eyes not falling for the bullshit.\u00a0\u201cOK , you know what , sue me. He was using those machines as a distraction instead of addressing the problem. At least<i> I</i> had the decency to come check on him. Where the hell were you?!\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gone for one hour and you two are already going at it?\u201d Your dad is strolling in to the dining room in his day clothes now.\u00a0\u201cDo we need a time out shirt or do I need to go out and , I don\u2019t know , buy new kids?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cI thought you liked our bickering?\u201d You smirk.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll grab the plates. Coffee?\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat smells amazing!\u201d Your face lights up with happiness after hearing her voice. Pepper walks in to the dining room with a huge smile on her face. With Happy following right behind her.</p><p>\u201cPepper!\u201d You rush over to her and embrace her in a tight hug.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were gonna be joining us.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You\u2019re across the country and you\u2019re finally all here together. I wasn\u2019t gonna miss out on spending time with my favorite kids.\u201d She smiles. Your dad clears his throat.\u00a0\u201cOh , hush you. I see you everyday. So what are we having?\u201d She walks across the dining room to join your dad and Anthony at the table and you continue towards the kitchen for the plate and utensils.<br></p><p>\u201cTypical american breakfast. Go on , Happy , take a seat. We\u2019ve made enough to feed an entire village.\u201d You hear Anthony tell her. You set down the plates in front of everyone before taking a seat of your own.<br></p><p>\u00a0That morning\u00a0 was filled with laughter , jokes and fun stories. It\u2019s been a while since you were surrounded by happiness and love , you almost forgot about all those nightmares and New York. Almost. But you weren\u2019t going to let that get in the way of enjoying your time with your family. Your dad was genuinely smiling and laughing with all of you , Happy was relaxed for once , and even with Stark Industries running smoothly\u00a0 you can tell Pepper was enjoying this time as well.\u00a0</p><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>\u00a0You slammed shut the dishwasher after loading it and let out a huge yawn. The excitement from earlier made you forget how tired you really were. But after scarfing down all that delicious food it was catching up with you again.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cNo sleep again?\u201d Your dad nearly startled you. You wiped your hair out of your face and chuckled softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Slowly slipping in to a food coma.\u201d You lie.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh,\u00a0 Pepper left these for you. She was in a rush to get back to the company but she wanted to make sure you got them.\u201d He holds up a small stack of papers.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had a look at them and they\u2019re no Picasso but they are good.\u201d He jokes as you look thru each drawing. They were drawings of you in your combat gear. One alongside Iron Man and your brother in his lab coat with , what you could only assume were the Iron Man drones. Another one you were alongside the other Avengers. You looked over the others and you heart felt like it could just burst.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0You let out a small laugh when you saw the one of you next to Captain America standing on top of a small hill of Chitauri Aliens and a heart drawn in between the two of you.\u00a0\u201cThese are the cutest things I have ever seen.\u201d You tell him.</p><p>\u201cI hear Fury\u2019s been wanting you on the team.\u201d He casually leans back against the counter and folds his arms across his chest. You shake your head , folding the drawings in half and setting them down on the counter next to you.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you gave these to me so you can help his case.\u201d You roll your eyes, \u201cAnd like I told him. I\u2019m not an Avenger. I just happen to be at the right place at the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s all it takes. I mean , you see how much the young ones look up to you. You saved thousands of people that day.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s <i>nothing</i> compared to the millions you saved.\u201d You said without thinking. But to your surprise your dad didn\u2019t flinch at the subtle mention of flying thru the wormhole.\u00a0\u201cBesides,\u201d you quickly changed the subject.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to handle the pressure of saving the world all the time.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cCompared to the pressure of taking care of me? That\u2019s like a walk in the park.\u201d He chuckled.\u00a0</p><p>You didn\u2019t laugh along.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re my dad. Whether you like it or not I\u2019m always gonna worry about you first.\u201d The smile he had on his face disappeared. You watched him as he let out a long sigh and pushed himself off the counter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your life to be all about worrying about me. To be honest I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t grown an ulcer from all the stress I\u2019ve put on you. Intentional or not.\u201d You opened your mouth to speak but he waved at you to be quiet,\u00a0\u201cjust hear me out. I know what you\u2019re doing here. I see what it\u2019s done to you because of me.\u00a0Honey , I love you.\u201d He walked the short distance to you as he spoke and placed his hands on your shoulders.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want you to grow up regretting not doing things you should\u2019ve at least taken a chance on. You\u2019re 20 years old and you\u2019re here with your old man. You know what I was doing when I was 20?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cCreating you and your brother.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd you said it.\u201d You roll your eyes.\u00a0\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is you want me to go out and reproduce?\u201d You chuckle.<br></p><p>\u201cGod no!\u201d He gasps.\u00a0\u201cI just want you to go out and have a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around taking care of me.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? If I didn\u2019t know any better I think you just want me outta here.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d He raises his hands up.\u00a0\u201cI asked Pepper to move in and she agreed. We thought it was time.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd it is.\u201d You smiled.\u00a0\u201cYeah , ok. I get it.

I&rsquo;m not an Avenger. I just happen to be at the right place at the right time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes that&rsquo;s all it takes. I mean , you see how much the young ones look up to you. You saved thousands of people that day.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>nothing</i> compared to the millions you saved.&rdquo; You said without thinking. But to your surprise your dad didn&rsquo;t flinch at the subtle mention of flying thru the wormhole.&nbsp;&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; you quickly changed the subject.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would be able to handle the pressure of saving the world all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Compared to the pressure of taking care of me? That&rsquo;s like a walk in the park.&rdquo; He chuckled.&nbsp;</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t laugh along.&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my dad. Whether you like it or not I&rsquo;m always gonna worry about you first.&rdquo; The smile he had on his face disappeared. You watched him as he let out a long sigh and pushed himself off the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your life to be all about worrying about me. To be honest I&rsquo;m surprised you haven&rsquo;t grown an ulcer from all the stress I&rsquo;ve put on you. Intentional or not.&rdquo; You opened your mouth to speak but he waved at you to be quiet,&nbsp;&ldquo;just hear me out. I know what you&rsquo;re doing here. I see what it&rsquo;s done to you because of me.&nbsp;Honey , I love you.&rdquo; He walked the short distance to you as he spoke and placed his hands on your shoulders.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to grow up regretting not doing things you should&rsquo;ve at least taken a chance on. You&rsquo;re 20 years old and you&rsquo;re here with your old man. You know what I was doing when I was 20?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell me-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Creating you and your brother.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And you said it.&rdquo; You roll your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;So what you&rsquo;re saying is you want me to go out and reproduce?&rdquo; You chuckle.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;God no!&rdquo; He gasps.&nbsp;&ldquo;I just want you to go out and have a life that doesn&rsquo;t revolve around taking care of me.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that? If I didn&rsquo;t know any better I think you just want me outta here.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You caught me.&rdquo; He raises his hands up.&nbsp;&ldquo;I asked Pepper to move in and she agreed. We thought it was time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And it is.&rdquo; You smiled.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah , ok. I get it. You two need your space.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey , but you know you&rsquo;re always welcome here , right?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Whatever&rsquo;s going on with you , just promise me you&rsquo;ll get the help you need. Don&rsquo;t let it get worse.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; He holds his hand up as he says ,&rdquo;Scout&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>( <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2siXohFTFKXJrAOWXifOYQ\">@lizlil</a>&nbsp; <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-vK_XPk5Oj30f3U0lqEb1Q\">@bookgirlunicorn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PolRizAJcdus9cxoyHNmw\">@moli1497</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFQQ5Tf5-trZDfW6UpPzIBQ\">@1awesomeash</a> )</p>",

The world knew very little of the Stark twins and Tony wanted to keep it that way. For the most part they knew one was a genius and the other was daddy&rsquo;s spoiled princess. But when Tony starts acting out of control , the twins are thrown in the middle of the crossfire , allowing the world to really see them. They now have to make a choice that will change their lives forever.</p>\n<p>After the battle in New York , you weren&rsquo;t expecting things to go back to normal but you certainly weren&rsquo;t expecting them to go to shit so fast. Your dad was suffering from PTSD. And even months after Loki brainwashing you with the scepter you were still suffering from it&rsquo;s effects. Will you let your emotions get the best of you and your abilities? How can you keep yourself and your dad from going completely off the rails?</p>\n<p>A/N : GIF not mine.

You did little small hops in place as the simulation cleaned itself up and prepared a new one. You looked over towards the ocean and sighed when you noticed the sun beginning to rise from the horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N it&rsquo;s nearly 6 in the morning. May I suggest we take a break and head inside for some shut eye.&rdquo; Edwin Jarvis spoke. The list of what you could do continued to grow with each passing day as you explored your abilities. One was illusion casting. You&rsquo;ve never met him , in fact you never knew J.A.R.V.I.S the AI was paid homage to an actual person in your dad&rsquo;s life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No. Just start the simulation and record. Like I asked.&rdquo; You remarked , waiving your hand at him. You were aggravated and straight up tired. You haven&rsquo;t slept well in days since you learned to absorb your father&rsquo;s fears in to you. You started off small at first , to make sure you would be able to control it and then once you gotten used to it you absorbed it completely. You channeled that fear in to controlling your abilities. He&rsquo;s been sleeping like a baby ever since so you didn&rsquo;t mind it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Jarvis , I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You turned to face the illusion but he was already gone.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n</p>",
