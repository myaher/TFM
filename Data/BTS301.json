He claims it\u2019s his way of adding beauty to chaos, of making something positive in a really negative place. He knows it\u2019s dangerous, but if he can make even one person\u2019s day with his beautiful floral arrangements, it\u2019s worth the risk.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is a street rat. He ran away from home at 15 and ever since, he\u2019s never stopped running\u2026until now. His hyung, Yoongi, has convinced him to settle down and attend art school. One problem: he can\u2019t afford it and gets in debt with some really rough types.

Old and new, veterans and newcomers, of all races, gender identities, sexual orientations and ages, and of all bias of any member or of all members!</p><p> This is GoAngelic here, as a ARMY Supporter, Ally and Guide! I\u2019ll be giving you a guide of knowing how to SURVIVE this BTS comeback, called Love Yourself: \u7d50 \u2018Answer\u2019, with roles of the ARMY family you may choose, rules of streaming new MVs that come out, the goals to reach, and which events, upcoming projects, etc. you choose to follow! Don\u2019t forget the Love Yourself World Tour, too! Now, let\u2019s get started!</p><p><b>ROLES OF THE ARMY FAMILY:</b><br/></p><p> To get started, there are many roles to apply to when it comes to the BTS ARMY! You can be normal, or be a diehard fan, whatever you choose, with some guidelines of how to be part of any role of the ARMY family.</p><p><b>GUIDELINES:</b></p><p>- Do not be a sasaeng fan; sasaeng fans always get in the way of your idols\u2019 private lives, including secretly stealing phone numbers, recording them in any private way, or trying to kidnap or kill them. This is never a good idea, because it will lead to trouble with the law! So, please don\u2019t try to be one.</p><p>-Don\u2019t discriminate; it may hurt others\u2019 feelings and opinions, in a very negative way. This means you should always treat the ways that want to be treated. Don\u2019t get involved in riots of other fandoms either!</p><p>-And most importantly, DO NOT TAKE YOUR OBSESSION TOO FAR! It may hurt your relationships with your family, friends and relatives and with your grades and hobbies at school or at home, and may cause severe addiction that may require therapy. Just, take your obsession seriously, and do not let it get in your way of real life, ever!</p><p> You get it now? Yes? Now, you\u2019ll be able to see each role of the ARMY family on your own. Let\u2019s go!</p><p><b>THE ROLES: </b></p><p>-The Normal ARMY: This should be a easy one. They are basically fans of their idols, called BTS! Their level of intensity depends: from softie, to easygoing, to normal, to fangirl mode, and finally, to diehard! They all have different interests, from exploring new content without \u201cdying\u201d to rediscovering old content and feeling nostalgic! They are also the most loving out of all, as they try their best to break records, as how BTS does it, for them!</p><p>-The Entertainers: The Entertainers are the ones who make fantastic meme compilations, cracks, FMVs, and much more. Their job for us is to try to give us a bit of fun and relaxation just to calm us down when we are already fangirling over new content, or specifically, anything that they are sensitive to! The Entertainers know what\u2019s best for us; just plain, old, funny dad jokes to make us laugh!</p><p>-The BTSquad: The BTSquad are the ones who always remind us of upcoming things, based on what time they\u2019re coming, like little alarm clocks ready to explode! Their job is to capture the legit time the new content (for example, the MVs) is coming in, and they\u2019ll count the days, hours, minutes and seconds, like big remindars, on any social media website they can find, like Twitter for example! They will always count for us, always.</p><p>-The Notification Squad: The Notification Squad are the ones who get us into the new content that comes out after the BTSquad does their job. It\u2019s like an aftermath miracle for many new and veteran ARMY! Their job is to remind us of new things that has came out if we are late at any time to the BTS party. Let\u2019s get on it!</p><p>-The Artists: The Artists are the ones who draw BTS fanart, basically. Their job is to draw as many fanart as they can, even if they get too busy with stuff, and that means it for the comeback too!</p><p>-The Hobbyists: The Hobbyists are the ones who create masterpieces, such as music remixes, mash-ups, fanfiction, AUs, and so much more! Their job is the same thing as the entertainers; keep company with the ARMY with some fun stuff on YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter\u2026 you name it! You can even be like the ARMY God Flirtaus, who created an AU that had theories being created for fun!</p><p>-The Supply Kits: The Supply Kits are the ones who prepare all the stuff that is needed for all ARMY when the comeback occurs, such as tissues, coffins, oxygen machines, preorders on Amazon, everything! Their job is to keep up with any supplies asked for by the ARMY, especially when the comeback is very close to explode on social media websites, such as Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, etc. Get the supplies ready!</p><p>-The Theorists: The Theorists are the ones who always theorizes anything plot-driven in the BTS community, from highlight reels, to supernatural things that happen in BTS-related stuff, like glitching, sudden changes, etc., and to connect MVs together. Their job is to basically, theorize anything \u201cweird\u201d that they can find! You go figure with them, as they always prioritize on what they do.</p><p>-The BTSeers: The BTSeers are the ones who lead the ARMY, along with the Supporters, which we will get in a second. Their job is to get the ARMY organized and ready for the comeback, even when any circumstances have to be taken by them.</p><p>-The Supporters: They are not official ARMY themselves, but they\u2019ll always get a chance to help out the ARMY in any way, just like a \u201ctiny miracle\u201d, just like how I am a Supporter myself! Their job is to join in the BTS party, and to help in any form possible to express fun to the comeback, even when it occurs!</p><p> Hooray! You made it through the roles of the ARMY family! Now, what\u2019s next? We\u2019ll get to the streaming rules once a new MV comes out!</p><p><b>STREAMING RULES:</b><br/></p><p> Now, you are at the streaming rules, which they are very important to all ARMY, in order to get the viewing goals, and viewing support that they want for their idols, BTS, to succeed from all other artists. Shall we?</p><p><b>THE IMPORTANT RULES:</b></p><p>1. LOG OUT of your YouTube account before you start streaming the MV. Along with that, clear all your history (search and watch) on your YT account before you log out of it, just to make sure not to run into anything. Also, if you have AdBlockers, make sure to turn them off.</p><p>2. Use a regular browser server when you stream. You may use many different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera, etc. to make your streaming experience easier. DO NOT use incognito mode on your browser for streaming the new MV.</p><p>3. Before you start streaming, make sure to make room for only one tab, which will be on YouTube, on your browser. NO MORE THAN ONE.</p><p>4. Search for the official MV on the channel ibighit; this channel provides all the official stuff for BTS, and former artists from that label. The MV will be based on the title track from the special comeback album, if you want to know more.</p><p>5. Once you reach the MV, set the video quality to 720pHD to get the best quality possible, and set the music volume to at least 50% or more. For the music part, do not mute the music or use headphones for this once-in-a-lifetime moment of the comeback. Turn off Auto-Play and do not skip any ads at all if ads were ever to appear.</p><p>6. Watch the entire video, and make your way to fangirl mode. DO NOT fast-forward, skip or pause at any moment at all, nor replay or refresh the browser to watch again.</p><p>7. Once you are done with the streaming, clear all browsing history, cache, cookies and activity from YouTube, and watch the video again, repeating several times to catch views. To not get caught as a bot, it\u2019s important to take a break from streaming by watching another video.</p><p>EXTRA: If you can, download yourself a VPN, if you have a fear of your ISP finding out about the streaming process you did. You may also share the MV on any social media website so you can help your friends track the new MV.</p><p> You made it here! Now, remember to follow all rules if you want the correct amount of views for the new MV. Onward to the goals to reach!</p><p><b>GOALS TO REACH:</b><br/></p><p> Want your favorite idols to break all kinds of records? Even breaking all of PSY\u2019s records? (Nah, just kidding\u2026) Well, in order to get your idols to succeed this year, make sure to bypass yourself to the following goals to reach:</p><p><b>GOALS:</b></p><p>-Stream the DNA MV to 500M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Fire MV to 425M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Dope MV and the Blood Sweat and Tears MV to 350M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Mic Drop Remix MV to 325M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Not Today MV and the Save Me MV to 300M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Fake Love MV to 275M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Boy In Luv MV to 250M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the Spring Day MV to 200M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the I Need U MV, the War Of Hormone MV and the Danger MV to 200M views on YouTube</p><p>-Stream the We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2 MV to 100M views on YouTube</p><p>-Reach 2.5M preorders from Amazon for Tear before the comeback</p><p>-Stream the new MV to at least 60M views and like to 3.5M likes in under 24 hours</p><p>-Reach 100 #1\u2019s on iTunes and 30M streams on Spotify in under 24 hours</p><p>-Get to Hot100 on Billboard\u2019s Top Ten and #1 in the Billboard 200</p><p>-Win all nominations for the Teen Choice Awards. Voting ends August 12</p><p>-Reach #1 trending on YouTube (specifically in the US and UK)</p><p>-Receive at least five daesangs at any music award show (MAMA, MMA, SMA, GDA, etc.)</p><p>-Get ready for the Love Yourself World Tour!</p><p> Those are all of our goals for BTS to achieve, in order to go for success! It\u2019s not for profit, but for love. Finally, we can reach all the possible things, events, etc. to look up to, because it will rack you up!</p><p><b>IMPORTANT EVENTS, THINGS, AND MORE TO LOOK UP TO:</b><br/></p><p> Many of you know that 2018 is going to be the BIGGEST year yet for BTS to overcome all fears, break all records and to sell out of all world tour tickets for the ARMY, right? Yep, it is. It could be from a project to look up to, to events to stream, to apps you can play in, and so on. Let\u2019s get it on!</p><p><b>LOOK UP TO THE FOLLOWING:</b><br/></p><p>-K-BUZZ and Kpop Buzz 2: These two news stations about everything Korean on YouTube, are very reliable to watch. If you want to catch the latest updates on BTS or any of your other favorites, go ahead and subscribe to these two channels.</p><p>-BTS World: The Cinematic Game: This interactive game, made by BigHit (BTS\u2019 label) and Netmarble Games is coming very soon. It is now up for an official demo before release, which the date hasn\u2019t been announced yet. Are you in?</p><p>-The Love Yourself World Tour: It\u2019s gonna be a blast for who is going. Have fun, all ARMY! Starts the day after the comeback!</p><p>-To The Edge Of The Sky (TTEOTS): A masterpiece, made by Aeon Dream Studio is a perfect visual novel-like game that summarizes BTS in a fictional, futuristic AU, with several NPCs, and the protagonist, which is you! Make sure to catch it on your phones or PCs in the app store!</p><p>-Run! BTS Episodes: New episodes are always made every week. Make sure to stop by a channel that has those episodes!</p><p>-And finally, the comeback and future comebacks themselves, thank you.</p><p> These are all the opportunities to go to if you want to. This will help increase the chance of becoming worldwide stars, for BTS! Thank you for all this time!</p><p><b>CONCLUSION:</b><br/></p><p> Hooray! You\u2019ve finally made it through this guide on how to survive the BTS comeback! You can also use this guide for future comebacks too, as a memorial guide, or just to follow rules of specific topics, such as how to be a true ARMY, and how to stream on YouTube when a new MV comes out! Thank you for patiently reading the entire guide through, and have a wonderful time before, during and after the comeback!</p><p>-From, GoAngelic</p><figure data-orig-width=\"415\" data-orig-height=\"323\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"seokkieverse:niuXjdWr5fSFEZRG6GHlBw:Z8pcPx2Y5ExQX\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f38f441dbda949850ca07a961c06b82/tumblr_p8y85uywUV1ql1ncto1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"415\" data-orig-height=\"323\"/></figure>",

Let\u2019s go!</p><p><b>THE ROLES: </b></p><p>-The Normal ARMY: This should be a easy one. They are basically fans of their idols, called BTS! Their level of intensity depends: from softie, to easygoing, to normal, to fangirl mode, and finally, to diehard! They all have different interests, from exploring new content without \u201cdying\u201d to rediscovering old content and feeling nostalgic! They are also the most loving out of all, as they try their best to break records, as how BTS does it, for them!</p><p>-The Entertainers: The Entertainers are the ones who make fantastic meme compilations, cracks, FMVs, and much more. Their job for us is to try to give us a bit of fun and relaxation just to calm us down when we are already fangirling over new content, or specifically, anything that they are sensitive to! The Entertainers know what\u2019s best for us; just plain, old, funny dad jokes to make us laugh!</p><p>-The BTSquad: The BTSquad are the ones who always remind us of upcoming things, based on what time they\u2019re coming, like little alarm clocks ready to explode! Their job is to capture the legit time the new content (for example, the MVs) is coming in, and they\u2019ll count the days, hours, minutes and seconds, like big remindars, on any social media website they can find, like Twitter for example! They will always count for us, always.</p><p>-The Notification Squad: The Notification Squad are the ones who get us into the new content that comes out after the BTSquad does their job. It\u2019s like an aftermath miracle for many new and veteran ARMY! Their job is to remind us of new things that has came out if we are late at any time to the BTS party. Let\u2019s get on it!</p><p>-The Artists: The Artists are the ones who draw BTS fanart, basically. Their job is to draw as many fanart as they can, even if they get too busy with stuff, and that means it for the comeback too!</p><p>-The Hobbyists: The Hobbyists are the ones who create masterpieces, such as music remixes, mash-ups, fanfiction, AUs, and so much more! Their job is the same thing as the entertainers; keep company with the ARMY with some fun stuff on YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter\u2026 you name it! You can even be like the ARMY God Flirtaus, who created an AU that had theories being created for fun!</p><p>-The Supply Kits: The Supply Kits are the ones who prepare all the stuff that is needed for all ARMY when the comeback occurs, such as tissues, coffins, oxygen machines, preorders on Amazon, everything! Their job is to keep up with any supplies asked for by the ARMY, especially when the comeback is very close to explode on social media websites, such as Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, etc. Get the supplies ready!</p><p>-The Theorists: The Theorists are the ones who always theorizes anything plot-driven in the BTS community, from highlight reels, to supernatural things that happen in BTS-related stuff, like glitching, sudden changes, etc., and to connect MVs together.

You go figure with them, as they always prioritize on what they do.</p><p>-The BTSeers: The BTSeers are the ones who lead the ARMY, along with the Supporters, which we will get in a second. Their job is to get the ARMY organized and ready for the comeback, even when any circumstances have to be taken by them.</p><p>-The Supporters: They are not official ARMY themselves, but they\u2019ll always get a chance to help out the ARMY in any way, just like a \u201ctiny miracle\u201d, just like how I am a Supporter myself!

Old and new, veterans and newcomers, of all races, gender identities, sexual orientations and ages, and of all bias of any member or of all members!</p><p> This is GoAngelic here, as a ARMY Supporter, Ally and Guide! I\u2019ll be giving you a guide of knowing how to SURVIVE this BTS comeback, called Love Yourself: \u7d50 \u2018Answer\u2019, with roles of the ARMY family you may choose, rules of streaming new MVs that come out, the goals to reach, and which events, upcoming projects, etc. you choose to follow! Don\u2019t forget the Love Yourself World Tour, too! Now, let\u2019s get started!</p><p><b>ROLES OF THE ARMY FAMILY:</b><br></p><p> To get started, there are many roles to apply to when it comes to the BTS ARMY! You can be normal, or be a diehard fan, whatever you choose, with some guidelines of how to be part of any role of the ARMY family.</p><p><b>GUIDELINES:</b></p><p>- Do not be a sasaeng fan; sasaeng fans always get in the way of your idols\u2019 private lives, including secretly stealing phone numbers, recording them in any private way, or trying to kidnap or kill them. This is never a good idea, because it will lead to trouble with the law! So, please don\u2019t try to be one.</p><p>-Don\u2019t discriminate; it may hurt others\u2019 feelings and opinions, in a very negative way. This means you should always treat the ways that want to be treated. Don\u2019t get involved in riots of other fandoms either!</p><p>-And most importantly, DO NOT TAKE YOUR OBSESSION TOO FAR! It may hurt your relationships with your family, friends and relatives and with your grades and hobbies at school or at home, and may cause severe addiction that may require therapy. Just, take your obsession seriously, and do not let it get in your way of real life, ever!</p><p> You get it now? Yes? Now, you\u2019ll be able to see each role of the ARMY family on your own.

I&rsquo;ll be giving you a guide of knowing how to SURVIVE this BTS comeback, called Love Yourself: &#32080; &lsquo;Answer&rsquo;, with roles of the ARMY family you may choose, rules of streaming new MVs that come out, the goals to reach, and which events, upcoming projects, etc. you choose to follow! Don&rsquo;t forget the Love Yourself World Tour, too! Now, let&rsquo;s get started!</p><p><b>ROLES OF THE ARMY FAMILY:</b><br /></p><p> To get started, there are many roles to apply to when it comes to the BTS ARMY! You can be normal, or be a diehard fan, whatever you choose, with some guidelines of how to be part of any role of the ARMY family.</p><p><b>GUIDELINES:</b></p><p>- Do not be a sasaeng fan; sasaeng fans always get in the way of your idols&rsquo; private lives, including secretly stealing phone numbers, recording them in any private way, or trying to kidnap or kill them. This is never a good idea, because it will lead to trouble with the law! So, please don&rsquo;t try to be one.</p><p>-Don&rsquo;t discriminate; it may hurt others&rsquo; feelings and opinions, in a very negative way. This means you should always treat the ways that want to be treated. Don&rsquo;t get involved in riots of other fandoms either!</p><p>-And most importantly, DO NOT TAKE YOUR OBSESSION TOO FAR! It may hurt your relationships with your family, friends and relatives and with your grades and hobbies at school or at home, and may cause severe addiction that may require therapy. Just, take your obsession seriously, and do not let it get in your way of real life, ever!</p><p> You get it now? Yes? Now, you&rsquo;ll be able to see each role of the ARMY family on your own. Let&rsquo;s go!</p><p><b>THE ROLES: </b></p><p>-The Normal ARMY: This should be a easy one. They are basically fans of their idols, called BTS! Their level of intensity depends: from softie, to easygoing, to normal, to fangirl mode, and finally, to diehard! They all have different interests, from exploring new content without &ldquo;dying&rdquo; to rediscovering old content and feeling nostalgic! They are also the most loving out of all, as they try their best to break records, as how BTS does it, for them!</p><p>-The Entertainers: The Entertainers are the ones who make fantastic meme compilations, cracks, FMVs, and much more. Their job for us is to try to give us a bit of fun and relaxation just to calm us down when we are already fangirling over new content, or specifically, anything that they are sensitive to! The Entertainers know what&rsquo;s best for us; just plain, old, funny dad jokes to make us laugh!</p><p>-The BTSquad: The BTSquad are the ones who always remind us of upcoming things, based on what time they&rsquo;re coming, like little alarm clocks ready to explode! Their job is to capture the legit time the new content (for example, the MVs) is coming in, and they&rsquo;ll count the days, hours, minutes and seconds, like big remindars, on any social media website they can find, like Twitter for example! They will always count for us, always.</p><p>-The Notification Squad: The Notification Squad are the ones who get us into the new content that comes out after the BTSquad does their job. It&rsquo;s like an aftermath miracle for many new and veteran ARMY! Their job is to remind us of new things that has came out if we are late at any time to the BTS party. Let&rsquo;s get on it!</p><p>-The Artists: The Artists are the ones who draw BTS fanart, basically. Their job is to draw as many fanart as they can, even if they get too busy with stuff, and that means it for the comeback too!</p><p>-The Hobbyists: The Hobbyists are the ones who create masterpieces, such as music remixes, mash-ups, fanfiction, AUs, and so much more! Their job is the same thing as the entertainers; keep company with the ARMY with some fun stuff on YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter&hellip; you name it! You can even be like the ARMY God Flirtaus, who created an AU that had theories being created for fun!</p><p>-The Supply Kits: The Supply Kits are the ones who prepare all the stuff that is needed for all ARMY when the comeback occurs, such as tissues, coffins, oxygen machines, preorders on Amazon, everything! Their job is to keep up with any supplies asked for by the ARMY, especially when the comeback is very close to explode on social media websites, such as Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, etc. Get the supplies ready!</p><p>-The Theorists: The Theorists are the ones who always theorizes anything plot-driven in the BTS community, from highlight reels, to supernatural things that happen in BTS-related stuff, like glitching, sudden changes, etc., and to connect MVs together. Their job is to basically, theorize anything &ldquo;weird&rdquo; that they can find! You go figure with them, as they always prioritize on what they do.</p><p>-The BTSeers: The BTSeers are the ones who lead the ARMY, along with the Supporters, which we will get in a second. Their job is to get the ARMY organized and ready for the comeback, even when any circumstances have to be taken by them.</p><p>-The Supporters: They are not official ARMY themselves, but they&rsquo;ll always get a chance to help out the ARMY in any way, just like a &ldquo;tiny miracle&rdquo;, just like how I am a Supporter myself! Their job is to join in the BTS party, and to help in any form possible to express fun to the comeback, even when it occurs!</p><p> Hooray! You made it through the roles of the ARMY family! Now, what&rsquo;s next? We&rsquo;ll get to the streaming rules once a new MV comes out!</p><p><b>STREAMING RULES:</b><br /></p><p> Now, you are at the streaming rules, which they are very important to all ARMY, in order to get the viewing goals, and viewing support that they want for their idols, BTS, to succeed from all other artists. Shall we?</p><p><b>THE IMPORTANT RULES:</b></p><p>1. LOG OUT of your YouTube account before you start streaming the MV. Along with that, clear all your history (search and watch) on your YT account before you log out of it, just to make sure not to run into anything. Also, if you have AdBlockers, make sure to turn them off.</p><p>2. Use a regular browser server when you stream. You may use many different browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera, etc. to make your streaming experience easier. DO NOT use incognito mode on your browser for streaming the new MV.</p><p>3. Before you start streaming, make sure to make room for only one tab, which will be on YouTube, on your browser. NO MORE THAN ONE.</p><p>4. Search for the official MV on the channel ibighit; this channel provides all the official stuff for BTS, and former artists from that label. The MV will be based on the title track from the special comeback album, if you want to know more.</p><p>5. Once you reach the MV, set the video quality to 720pHD to get the best quality possible, and set the music volume to at least 50% or more. For the music part, do not mute the music or use headphones for this once-in-a-lifetime moment of the comeback. Turn off Auto-Play and do not skip any ads at all if ads were ever to appear.</p><p>6. Watch the entire video, and make your way to fangirl mode. DO NOT fast-forward, skip or pause at any moment at all, nor replay or refresh the browser to watch again.</p><p>7. Once you are done with the streaming, clear all browsing history, cache, cookies and activity from YouTube, and watch the video again, repeating several times to catch views. To not get caught as a bot, it&rsquo;s important to take a break from streaming by watching another video.</p><p>EXTRA: If you can, download yourself a VPN, if you have a fear of your ISP finding out about the streaming process you did. You may also share the MV on any social media website so you can help your friends track the new MV.</p><p> You made it here! Now, remember to follow all rules if you want the correct amount of views for the new MV. Onward to the goals to reach!</p><p><b>GOALS TO REACH:</b><br /></p><p> Want your favorite idols to break all kinds of records? Even breaking all of PSY&rsquo;s records?

Have fun, all ARMY!

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a><br/></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> The Sequel: <i><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/177276444294/our-second-chance-ch1\">Our Second Chance</a>\u00a0</i></small></p><hr><h2><i>Final Chapter: So, the Princess &amp; Her Knight\u2026</i></h2><!-- more --><p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin heard Sumin\u2019s sporadic breathing and\npulled her into a loving embrace. He rested his chin on top of her head and\nuttered words of love and comfort. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\ndo not want to marry that horrid King Ji Yong. I will not!\u201d Sumin declared,\nalerting Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>Upon hearing his name, Seokjin\u2019s body\nimmediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury engulfed his body. That evil king\nwould not leave his princess alone, and Seokjin had grown tired of him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat are you talking about?\u201d Seokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </i></p><p><i>Sumin remained silent, unsure if she should\nfinally tell him the truth. </i></p><p><i>After quickly debating, Sumin opened her\nmouth and said,</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Seokjin\neyed Sumin eagerly, wanting to know what that devilish king had done to her. He\nrested a loving hand on her shoulder, while the other hand rubbed her arm\ngently. </p><p>Encouraging\nwords left his lips in whispers as he patiently waited for her to start\ntalking. </p><p>Sumin\ninhaled, then exhaled. She repeated the process until the horrible anxiety left\nher tummy. </p><p>With\none last breath, she mustered enough courage and looked in her knight\u2019s eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAs I said earlier, it is King Ji\nYong. He had been sending me rather concerning letters, and they were always\naccompanied with red rose\u2026\u201d Sumin trailed on, trying to find the right words to\nsay next. The last thing she wanted was to trigger her lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as his eyes slowly closed. He calmed his sporadic breathing while\nthe anger slowly took control. No. Sumin did not deserve to be on the receiving\nend of his wrath. If anyone deserved the consequences of his fury, it was that\nstupid king that had yet to realize that Sumin was <i>his</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you have any of those letters?\nMay I see them?\u201d requested Seokjin, wanting to know the severity of these\n\u201clove\u201d letters. </p><p>Sumin\nnearly choked. A nervous smile graced her lips followed by a few forced chuckles.\nBoy\u2026how was she going to tell him that she had her dear nurse burn them? Would\nhe think she was hiding something from him? Wait\u2026scratch that\u2026 she technically\ndid hide something from him. </p><p>Damn\nit\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026 about that, my love\u2026 you see\u2026\nI\u2026um\u2026\u201d Sumin paused, fiddling with her engagement ring that hung nicely from\nthe silver chain around her neck, \u201cI may have had my\u2026um\u2026 nurse burn them\nbecause I did not want to worry you, my beloved.\u201d She finished, feeling a tiny\nweight lift off her shoulders. She no longer had to hide this terrible secret\nfrom him. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded slowly; his facial expression was practically unreadable. Uh-oh. That\nwas never a good sign with him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled as if she was on the verge of tears. Correction, she was already\ncrying. Her chest tightened as the thought of losing Seokjin frightened her to\nknow end. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am so sorry for lying to you,\nSeokjin. I was honestly terrified of the thought of me marrying someone who is\nnot you, and the more I dwell on that horrid idea, the more I fear that it will\ncome true,\u201d A choked like sob escaped her lips, \u201cI will not marry that cold,\ncalculating King Ji Yong. I do not love him, nor will I <i>ever</i> love him.\u201d Sumin firmly declared as tears continued to cascade\ndown her cheeks. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes flickered from concern to this sense of pride. He instantly captured her\nlips, not caring if his cheeks became stained with her tears. His heart soared\nfrom hearing your declaration. </p><p>Slowly,\nhe pulled away from his princess; a warm smile graced his lips as he did.</p><p>With\nnothing but pure love in his eyes, Seokjin stared at Sumin as his thumb gently\ncaressed her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be okay princess,\u201d He\nbegan, placing a soft kiss on her forehead, \u201cAs long as you wear that ring\naround your neck, I am not going anywhere. You and I will wed, and that is\nfinal. Nothing and no one will get in the way of that. I promise you.\u201d Seokjin\ndeclared as he gently lifted both of her hands and kissed her knuckles softly. </p><p>Sumin\nlooked at up with shaky eyes. Her heart warmed after his hearing his promise,\nhowever, in the back of her mind, she knew that it was worthless.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not make promises you cannot\nkeep\u2026\u201d She whispered as she eyed the stone walkway with nothing but utter\nsadness. </p><p>A\ndepressed sigh escaped his lips as Seokjin felt his heart break just a bit.\nSumin lacked faith in them right now, and it deeply hurt him. At the same time,\nhe understood why she felt that way. With a pending battle happening a lot\nsooner than they had hoped, anything could happen to him. Hell, he might not\neven come back alive. Just the mere thought of him lying on the cold\nground\u2014lifeless\u2014terrified them both, especially Sumin. She could not bear the\nthought of living on a world where her one true love was no longer present. </p><p>She was\nalready losing her father, and she would be damned if she lost her childhood\nsweetheart as well. </p><p>If she\ncould, she would ride into battle herself and end the war. No need to send her\nbeloved to the bloody warzone\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Seokjin noticed a familiar, scheming gleam in his\nprincess\u2019s eyes. He knew that she\u2019s toying with the idea of fighting in place\nof her father, but with his good conscious, Seokjin could not allow that. </p><p>Placing\nboth his index and middle fingers under her chin, Seokjin titled her head\nslightly. Their eyes met. Love glazed over them as they remained still. Their\nhearts beat as one as the sounds of waves crashing entered their ears. The soft\nocean breeze brushed past their bodies. Little by little the gap between their\nlips closed. Then, in just one kiss, they poured their entire\nlove\u2026admiration\u2026longing that had been building since they were mere children. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled Sumin closer, wanting nothing more to keep her close, as they continued\nto kiss. Sumin cupped Seokjin\u2019s face as she feared that he would disappear if\nshe didn\u2019t keep a firm hold on him. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, the lovers pulled apart yet remained holding each\nother. </p><p>With a\nloving smile, Sumin asked,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCould you accompany me back to my\nchambers, especially since we must part ways tomorrow at dawn.\u201d<br/>\nA short yet soft scoff left his lips as Seokjin smiled warmly at his woman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never have to ask me to stay\nthe night since I will always say yes.\u201d He replied, placing a sweet kiss on her\ncheek.</p><p>Sumin\nsmiled brightly and intertwined their hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, shall we go to sleep, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>In a\nblink of an eye, the moon had faded behind the mountains, and the sun took its\nplace high in the sky. Sounds of birds singing their mating tune entered\nSumin\u2019s room. Tiny streaks of sunlight penetrated her ivory laced curtains,\ncreating beautiful shadow patterns on the cold floors, walls, and even her\nblankets. </p><p>A faint\ngroan was heard as the tired princess turned over, hoping to cuddle with her\ndear knight some more. Her arm landed on a soft padding rather semi-hard flesh.\nSumin pried one eye open and then the other immediately shot open. She quickly\nsat up and frantically searched for her Seokjin. Though, deep down, she knew\nthat he had already left in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Her\neyes sadly trailed down as tiny tears formed. She wanted to bid a fond farewell\nand send him off with a sweet kiss. Maybe even had given him a token to remind\nhim what and who he was fighting for. </p><p>Maybe\nit was for the best that he had left while she slumbered\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, she had noticed a faint blob of yellow. Sumin instantly\nturned towards the right, the side where Seokjin had slept peacefully since the\nday they had become lovers and saw a yellow rose on top of a letter. </p><p>A\ngentle smile slowly appeared on her face as she picked up the rose. She held\nthe flower up to her nostrils and inhaled its sweet scent. It was just like her\nknight to remember that she had grown fond of yellow roses. A special fact that\nJi Yong would never understand. </p><p>After\ntaking in the flowers scent for a few more minutes, Sumin finally lowered the\nflower. She then picked up the note and unfolded it. </p><p>Her\neyes widened. Her brows furrowed. She scanned the graciously written content\nand with each word, tears formed. </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndarling. My love. The keeper of my heart. The one and only princess for me. By\nthe time you are reading this letter, I have already left for the battlefield\nwith the support of our kingdom. I could not bear the thought of waking you up from\nyour precious slumber and bidding you a fond farewell in person. It honestly\ntook all of my strength to remove my arm from your precious waist. If I had the\nopportunity, I would gladly stay by your side and enjoy your smiles. Your\nlaughter. How your eyes light up whenever you are around me\u2026 Unfortunately, the\nHoly Father had other plans for me\u2026 I have but one request of you, my darling\nSumin\u2026 Please do not shed any tears for me. I will return from the battlefield\nvictorious, and you and I will be wedded. Until then, every time you feel the\nwind fan your face, think of its as my love. I had asked the Gods of nature to\nreceive my love and carry it to you. I love you so much. </i></p><p><i>Forever yours, </i></p><p><i>Seokjin.\u201d</i></p><p>Tears\nstreamed down her rosy cheeks the second she read the last line of Seokjin\u2019s\nletter. He loved her so much that he didn\u2019t want to wake her up. He wanted to\nremember her with no tear stains, so that\u2019s how she was going to honor his\nwish.</p><p>No more\ntears shall be shed. Only her endless amount of love would remain to be shown.</p><p>She\nwould put on a brave face and hold down the castle. That way, there would be a\ncastle for her beloved to return to. </p><p>With a\ndetermined smile, Sumin practically jumped out of bed and called for a servant.\nShe sat down in front of her mirror and picked up her sapphire encrusted\nhairbrush. She smoothed away her atrocious bed hair.</p><p>As she\nwas brushing her hair, the servant rushed inside her chambers. He quickly bowed\nand asked what he was needed for. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am in dire need to send Seokjin a\nletter. Pray tell me, where would he be stationed at?\u201d Sumin told the servant,\nasking where her knight is stationed on. </p><p>The\nservant\u2019s eyes widened, but he soon composed himself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin is currently at the\nmountain pass. Shall I fetch you a messenger?\u201d He asked, ready to anything and\neverything to make the princess pleased with him. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head as she stood up from her vanity mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to my father\u2019s study and\nwrite him a letter instead. I am sure my love would rather have a written reply\nrather than some man relaying it,\u201d She bowed her head, \u201cThank you, though. You\nmay go now.\u201d She said, politely dismissing the castle worker. </p><p>The\nservant quickly muttered, \u201cYes, your highness.\u201d, before exiting her chambers. </p><p>Sumin\nwaited to hear the door shut before dashing towards her wardrobe. She swiftly\npicked a pastel blue dress with a diamond accent detail. The diamonds were\nshaped as snowflakes that decorated the outer white laced skirt. </p><p>She\npaired the dress with navy blue heels and went for the simpler sapphire and\ndiamond crown. She placed the crown gently on top of her head as she walked out\nof her bedroom, ready to write the first of many letters for one true love\u2026</p><p>Minutes\nhad turned into hours, hours had turned into days and just like that, days had\nturned into weeks. </p><p>Those\nlong weeks without seeing her knight had been the most excruciating for\nPrincess Sumin. However, each time she received a letter from Seokjin, it made\nthose lonely nights bearable\u2014especially since they were always accompanied with\na yellow rose. </p><p>Each\ntime she smelled the sweet perfume of the rose, a warm smile graced her lips.\nHer heart warmed at the thought of feeling his love with each word he wrote in\nthe letters. </p><p>God,\nhow she missed him\u2026</p><p>Currently\nreading yet another of Seokjin\u2019s letter as she inhaled the hypnotic scent that\nthe flower had to offer, Sumin\u2019s thoughts had been interrupted when a castle\nworker stormed inside her room; his breath heavy and sporadic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d Sumin politely questioned the\nyoung man. </p><p>The\nworker quickly bowed his head in respect before speaking,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour highness. My deepest apologies\nfor the intrusion, but I have come here to announce that King Ji Yong shall be\narriving soon.\u201d</p><p>With\njust one little announcement, Sumin\u2019s world came crashing down. What\u2026no\u2026why was\nthat horrid king coming to visit? He had no reason to come\u2026unless\u2026he had found\nout about her father\u2019s worsening condition. No. There was no way because each\ncastle worker had been sworn to secrecy. No one would dare to defy the royal\nfamily\u2019s orders, so why had he come then?</p><p>Unless\u2026</p><p>He had\ncome for her hand in marriage\u2014again. Could he not leave an engaged woman alone?</p><p>Few\nseconds went by and nothing, but the ocean breeze was heard. Then, with a\ndignified smile, Sumin turned around and thanked the worker for his message.\nShe then dismissed him, telling him to carry on with his duties. The worker\nsmiled politely, bowed his head, and exited the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright, you annoying pest. Why are\nyou in my kingdom?\u201d Sumin muttered to herself as she walked to the one place\nshe had been lingering around for the past few weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith King Ji Yong, his carriage had just pulled up at the entrance. He peeked\nthrough the curtains with a scheming smirk. His plan would officially commence.\nHis plan of having the dear Princess Sumin standing with him at the altar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow dare that lowly, pathetic\nknight propose to <i>my</i> wife\u2026\u201d King Ji Yong\nthought bitterly as he roughly closed the curtains. He leaned back in his seat,\nrubbing his chin as he thought about the idea of marriage with Sumin. He would\nhave her one way or another. At this rate, he could care less if she married\nhim while sobbing. She would be his wife\u2014the mother of his children\u2026</p><p>Stepping\nout of the carriage, King Ji Yong quickly ordered his driver to go wait for him\nsomewhere else. The driver nodded and took off with the carriage. King Ji Yong\nthen began to walk towards the courtyard as he scanned the area for\nsomeone\u2014anyone. Luckily, he managed to find someone and with an intimidating\nstare, he asked the poor worker where the princess was at. Out of fear, the\nworker quickly said that the princess was in her father\u2019s study and pointed in\nthe direction of the room. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked in response and thanked the servant for his assistant. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am coming for you, my lovely\nprincess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Now holed\nin her father\u2019s study, Sumin dipped her quill in the ink jar and continued to\nwrite out intimate details to her love. She wrote how she longed for his touch.\nHow she longed for his sweet kisses. In short, how she longed for him to be her\nside. \u00a0</p><p>A smile\nof content formed on her lips as Sumin signed her name on the bottom of the\nparchment. She blew lightly on the ink, making sure it was dry before folding\nit up. As a little gift for her knight, she pressed her lips onto the\nparchment. She pulled away satisfied with the lip stain that displayed near her\nname. Seokjin would love that. </p><p>Just as\nshe poured a bit of hot wax onto the letter, a light knock entered her ears.\nHer brows raised. Her chest heaved. Something in the pit of her stomach told\nher that it was the one person she absolutely did not want to see that stood on\nthe other side of the door.</p><p>Sumin\nrolled her eyes before mustering a diplomatic smile and said, \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><p>Not\neven seconds later, King Ji Yong strolled in and closed the door behind him.\nSumin raised her brow, finding his actions rather odd. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKing Ji Yong, to what do I owe the\npleasure of your presence in my kingdom?\u201d asked Sumin as she bowed her head in\nrespect.</p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked, drinking in her splendid appearance. Sumin would forever be his\nmost prized possession. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I thought I should pay you\nvisit since I have desperately missed you.\u201d He replied as he walked over to her\nand lifted her chin. He wanted their eyes to meet. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit right and there. She despised his touch on her\nprecious skin. Her sacred body would forever be reserved for Seokjin only.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour majesty, I appreciate your\nsweet words but do refrain yourself from using them as I am now an engaged\nwoman.\u201d Sumin confessed; her eyes flickered with triumph.</p><p>However,\nthat sudden announcement did not waiver the scheming king. If anything, it made\nhim more determined to make sure that his plan succeeded. </p><p>King Ji\nYong nodded his head slowly. He took one step, then another until the gap\nclosed between them. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt vulnerable. She felt like a prey being backed into a corner by its\npredator. Every time he took a step, she took a step back until she felt her\nback hit the edge of the desk. Her hands gripped the corners, ready to pick up\nanything that she could stab this man with. She could care less of the\nconsequences right now. She was willing to kill this king if it meant not only\nher safety, but the entire kingdom\u2019s as well\u2014especially Seokjin\u2019s. She would go\nto war for that man, and it seemed like she was about to.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yes\u2026 I have heard that your\nfianc\u00e9 is fighting in your father\u2019s place. You know\u2026\u201d He began clicking his\ntongue in a condescending manner, \u201cIt is quite a pity that he is battling\nenemies that I have paid quite a sum to rage war against your people\u2026\u201d He\nconfessed, smirking evilly. </p><p>In that\nmoment, Sumin felt as if someone knocked the air right out of here. Had she\nheard him, right? Had he truly stooped so low to have paid a hefty sum just to\nrage war on her kingdom? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY-you what\u2026?\u201d Sumin questioned,\nstumbling over her words. </p><p>King Ji\nYong merely smirked in response, \u201cYou see, my dear princess,\u201d He stood in front\nher, trapping her between him and the desk, \u201cI am quite a jealous man, and the\nmoment I have set my eyes on you, I knew you were the wife for me.\u201d He declared\nwith an evil smirk. </p><p>Sumin\npractically snarled at the man. Her eyes narrowed, almost becoming slits. She\nwas officially done with this rude king. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will <i>never</i> be your wife, so as long as Seokjin continues to fight for\nhis life and for my people.\u201d She said, practically spitting in his face. </p><p>A soft\nscoff escaped his lips as King Ji Yong created a bit of space between them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, it would be quite hard to\nfight for your people if he is captured by the enemy and is currently waiting\nfor his execution.\u201d He confessed, taunting the fiery spirted princess.</p><p>Now, it\nfelt like someone stabbed her in the heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHis what?\u201d She said softly; her\nvoice practically a whisper. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou heard me\u2026\u201d King Jiyong remained\nsmirking. </p><p>No. </p><p>He was\nsafe. He had to be safe. </p><p>As if\nsomeone pulled the rug underneath her feet, Sumin collapsed onto the fall; her\nsobs became uncontrollable. Her heart pounded against her chase as it broke\nlittle by little. </p><p>King Ji\nYong had to be lying. He was cruel, deceitful, and dishonorable. No. She\nrefused to believe anything that came out his mouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re lying. He had been sending\nme letter practically every single day. There is no possible way that he could\nhave been captured by my father\u2019s enemies. No. I refuse to believe your petty\nlies.\u201d Sumin said as she tried her hardest to calm herself. </p><p>King Ji\nYong clicked his tongue yet again and looked at the princess with \u201csympathetic\u201d\neyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf only they were indeed lies,\u201d He\nthen gestured towards the desk, \u201cLook at the date at your knight\u2019s latest\nletter. I am almost certain that it had been weeks since he had sent that,\ncorrect?\u201d He finished, hiding the calculating grin that threatened to form. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him before scrambling up and fetching his letter. Her hands hurriedly\ngrabbed the piece of parchment paper. Her eyes homed in on the date written in\nthe top left corner. </p><p>Shit. </p><p>That\nstupid kind had been right. The day he wrote it and the day she had received\nit, it was indeed a few weeks later. </p><p>Nope. </p><p>This\nwas not going to happen. She had meant what she said about going to war for\nSeokjin. It seemed like the time had come. Time to draw her father\u2019s sword and\nfight for her man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!!\u201d She shouted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing, princess?\u201d King\nJi Yong inquired, raising his brow. </p><p>Sumin\nglared coldly at the man and ignored his question.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!\u201d She yelled once more.\nSeconds later, two guards rushed inside the office and bowed their heads and\nrespect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They\nanswered. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady my horse and tell the nurse\nto prepare my riding outfit.\u201d She ordered as the anger surged through her\nveins.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They replied\nbefore hurrying out of the office. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAgain, what are you doing, Princess\nSumin?\u201d King Ji Yong asked with a bored expression. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed loudly, completely fed up with the annoying man.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you must know, I plan to draw my\nfather\u2019s sword, ride into enemy lines, and fight for my knight. Now, if you\nkindly do not mind, I will take my leave.\u201d She stated, announcing her plans. </p><p>King Ji\nYong stared at her with an amused expression. He mentally counted down from\nten, allowing her to finish her little dramatic act. Then, just as she reached\nthe iron door handle, he spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually do not mind since anyone\nwith ears can tell you that your idea is terrible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nscoffed and turned around; her body now faced him. She crossed her arms over\nher chest and gave him an impatient look, wanting him to continue with whatever\nhe has to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour idea is rather horrid since\nthere is no way those ruthless generals would ever listen to a mere princess\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed on, pausing for effect, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut they would listen to a queen.\u201d\nKing Ji Yong finished with a devilish smirk.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes widened. Confusion painted on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMarry me, Princess Sumin and with a\nsnap of my finger, the war will be over. Say yes to being my queen, and your\nprecious Seokjin will return home unharmed.\u201d King Ji Yong said, staring her\ndown. </p><p>Sumin\npanted; she felt this unspeakable heavy burden crush her shoulders. Her heart\nraced as her palms became clammy. Tears began to fill the brim of her eyes. Too\nmany thoughts flooded her mind. She questioned her morals but soon dismissed\nevery single one of them. At the end of the day, she would do everything and\nanything to ensure the safety of her kingdom and the people that inhabited the\nland. Yes. She knew what must be done. </p><p>She met\nthe cold King\u2019s gaze and walked towards him. Taking one final deep breath, Sumin\nsaid,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><p>King Ji\nYong\u2019s brow perked up as an intrigued smirk appeared on his face. He wrapped an\narm around her shoulders and pulled her closer; the possessiveness in his stare\nwas ever so visible. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou made a wise decision,\u201d He\npressed his lips against her temple, \u201cI promise that I will call of the war\nfirst thing tomorrow morning.\u201d He whispered \u201csweetly\u201d in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched as she forced a smile at her new fianc\u00e9.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease forgive me my love\u2026\u201d She\nthought sadly as Seokjin\u2019s handsome face flashed once in her mind.</p><p>Few\ndays later, in a camp zone filled with many tents, horses, and men practicing\ntheir swordsmanship, Seokjin studied the battle map once more. His body had\nlittle to no wounds, and he was safe. Unknown to Sumin, King Ji Yong had lied\nabout Seokjin\u2019s wellbeing. He was never captured by the enemy and awaited his\nexecution. No. He spun the truth. In fact, it was actually the enemy general\nthat was captured by Seokjin\u2019s men and brought for trial. The enemy had been tried\nfor treason against Sumin\u2019s kingdom and was sentenced to death. </p><p>Too\nabsorbed in the map\u2019s details, Seokjin muttered different plans of attack to\nhimself, wondering which route he should take. Suddenly, a loud wave of cheers\nwas heard. His curiosity had gotten the best of him, and Seokjin walked out of\nhis tent.</p><p>The\nmoment he stepped outside, Seokjin instantly saw bright smiles and tears of joy\nspilled out of his men. </p><p>Now, he\nbecame even more confused. </p><p>Seokjin\nquickly grabbed one of his soldiers and demanded that he tell him what was\ngoing on. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe war, sir. It is finished.\u201d The\nsolider announced with a bright smile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, \u201cWhat do you mean that the war is over?\u201d He asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOne of the other enemy generals has\noffered his unconditional surrender. Then, eventually, the rest of them\nfollowed suit. The war is over, my lord.\u201d The soldier happily explained before\nrunning over to his friends to celebrate some more. </p><p>Seokjin\nscoffed softly yet a smile of relief graced his face. The battle was over, and\nthat meant that he was allowed to go home\u2014to go back to Sumin. </p><p>Yet,\nsomething in the back of his mind would not leave him alone. While he was\noverjoyed with the battle being over, something told him that this war should\nnot have ended easily. This bloody battle should not have ended in less than a\nmonth\u2026</p><p>Then,\nrealization struck him. This had the work of that evil King Ji Yong written all\nover it. </p><p>Seokjin\ndashed towards his horse and swiftly rushed back to the kingdom, silently\npraying that he was not too late. From where he had been stationed at, it would\ntake him a little over two days to get back to Sumin\u2019s kingdom, however, instead\nof allowing that to fill his heart with anxiety, he instead used it fuel his\nadrenaline\u2014his determination\u2014and increased the speed of his horse. He had to\nget back to his princess\u2014his one true love\u2026</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith Sumin, she stared blankly at her reflection; this emotionless wave washed\nover her eyes. She looked dead. She felt dead to be honest. Both on the inside\nand on the outside. She was about to marry someone she did not love nor; would\nshe ever love. </p><p>She\nfelt her hair being pulled in different directions. She watched her maids pin\nevery curl into different spots until they were satisfied with how their\nprincess looked. Her hair had been decorated with diamonds, that were shaped as\nflowers. Her crown rested nicely on top of her hand while her lacey veil\nshielded her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cP-princess\u2026 it is time to put on\nyour dress.\u201d Sumin heard one of her maids announce. </p><p>Sumin\nturned away from the mirror and forced a smile. While they were busy preparing\nher hair and makeup, Sumin had heard them sniffling and taking deeps breaths.\nHer maids, especially her nurse, hated seeing their beloved princess looking so\ndead. Their hearts ached for Sumin as they desperately wished that they could\ndo something to stop this wedding. They always dreamt of helping their princess\nget ready for her wedding, but in their minds, the wedding was for her and\nSeokjin. Not her and King Ji Yong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess permit me to speak.\u201d The\nnurse asked as she guided Sumin towards her dress.</p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response, allowing the nurse to speak her mind.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt breaks my heart to see you this\nway. I pray to the Holy Father that he will put a stop to this ceremony. You do\nnot deserve to marry such a despicable man.\u201d The nurse said; her eyes dripped\nwith concern. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled before she bit her bottom lip. She was doing a great job at not\nbreaking down and sobbing. She was not going to start now. She had to remain\nstrong for everyone dear in her life. </p><p>She\nsmiles softly and places a warm hand on the nurse\u2019s cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u2026\u201d She said\nsoftly, maintaining her smile. </p><p>The\nnurse sniffled. Tears filled the brims of her eyes. </p><p>Naturally,\nSumin too began to tear up. However, she wiped them away before it could ruin\nher makeup. She then reminded herself that she was doing this for Seokjin\u2019s\nsafety. Once this was all over, Seokjin would be safe and back in the kingdom.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will forgive you, Sumin. He\nwill\u2026\u201d She thought while she felt a few of the maids lace up the corset. </p><p>One of\nthe maids then instructed that she stepped inside her wedding skirt. Sumin\nobediently followed their directions until her body had been completely covered\nby the ceremonial gown.</p><p>Sumin\nslowly turned around and faced the mirror. Her eyes observed her reflection. All\nthis time, she had pictured herself in this dress for her marriage to Seokjin.\nA part of her wished that she had picked out a different dress for her marriage\nto King Ji Yong, but it was too late. </p><p>Time\nwas something that was never on her side. What would make her wedding day any\ndifferent?</p><p>The\nnurse and maids bowed their head in respect, not wanting Sumin to see them\ncrying. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs the carriage ready? I am ready\nto embark on this journey to wifehood.\u201d Sumin muttered, staring at the floor\nsadly. </p><p>The\nnurse nodded and escorted her out of the room.</p><p>Outside\nwas King Ji Yong\u2019s knights, ready to escort the princess to the church. King Ji\nYong had ordered them to make sure that Sumin would not try any funny business\nor run, leaving him at the altar. He was only minutes away from having Sumin as\nhis bride. Nothing and no one would stop him now\u2026</p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, Seokjin had finally arrived back to the kingdom. He\npractically hopped off his horse and dashed inside the castle grounds. His eyes\nhurriedly scanned, hoping to find anyone who would know the whereabouts of the\nprincess. He began to lose hope as nobody was seen in the courtyard. </p><p>Luckily,\nhis eye homed in on a familiar face. Princess Sumin\u2019s dear and beloved nurse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d Seokjin hollered as he ran\nup to her. </p><p>The\nnurse\u2019s eyes widened. A look of shocked washed over her face as she slowly\nbecame confused. What was Sumin\u2019s knight doing here?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin?!\u201d The nurse shouted\nback as she looked over the knight\u2019s body, hoping to find any signs of being\ntortured. \u201cYou are alive and well? But? How is that possible?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nbrows furrowed, \u201cOf course, I am alive. Whatever that horrid King Ji Yong has\nsaid, it is nothing but lies. Now, tell me, where is Sumin? I must show her\nthat I am alive and safe.\u201d He demanded, panting. </p><p>The\nnurse stared at him with sympathetic eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am sorry, Seokjin, but the\nprincess is on her way to the church. She might be even already there.\u201d She explained,\nfearing that all hope was lost. </p><p>However,\nSeokjin refused to admit defeat. He was ready to fight King Ji Yong if he had\nto. </p><p>He quickly\nuttered a \u201cthanks\u201d before rushing back to his horse and riding towards the\nchurch. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not marry him, Sumin. Just hold\non\u2026\u201d He anxiously thought.</p><p>With\nthe church in his sight, Seokjin increased the speed of his horse. His heart\nraced with both anxiety and adrenaline as the church steps appeared in front of\nhim. He then pulled on the reins and halted his horse\u2019s steps. </p><p>Seokjin\njumped off his horse and ran up the stairs. He pushed open the church doors and\nunfortunately, his heart shattered into a million of pieces. He froze in his\nplace as his eyes widened. His fingers trembled as his breathing became\nsporadic. </p><p>There\nhe stood, watching the love of his life kiss someone else. King Ji Yong had\nwon. He had won <i>his</i> princess\u2019s hand\nin marriage. That son of a bitch\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI present you their royal\nmajesties, King Ji Yong and his Queen Sumin.\u201d The priest announced; though, he\ntried his best to sound happy. He saw Sumin\u2019s body language, and it screamed at\nhim to put a stop to the ceremony. Now, the priest would live with this guilt\nfor the rest of his life. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmind screamed at him to leave the church, but for some reason his feet refused\nto listen to him. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhis eyes caught Sumin\u2019s gaze. Due to being far away, Seokjin could not see the\nbrokenness and despair in her eyes. To him, she was filled with joy. To her,\nshe was depressed, defeated, and above all\u2026she was surprised to see Seokjin\nalive and unharmed. Confusion filled her mind as her eyes switched from her\nknight to her now husband. </p><p>At that\nmoment, she felt like an idiot. She angrily turned towards her <i>husband</i> but before she could demand him\nto tell her the truth, King Ji Yong roughly pulled her closer and whispered a\nbone chilling threat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you do anything rash, I will\nhave my men kill your knight where he stands. Now, do you really want bloodshed\non our wedding day?\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nfought back her tears, even though a few of them had already cascaded down her\nrosy cheeks. She shook her head, closing her eyes briefly. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smiled and kissed her head sweetly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d He said softly with a creepy\ngrin. </p><p>Sumin\nopened her eyes and met Seokjin\u2019s gaze one last time. With a sad smile, she\nmouthed, </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nforced a smile and mouthed, \u201cI love you too\u2026\u201d</p><p>He flickered\nhis gaze onto King Ji Yong, who was now smirking proudly, before turning his\nback towards the \u201chappy\u201d couple. </p><p>He\nopened the doors and walked away, leaving behind the cheers and lively applause\u2026</p><p><i>And the princess and her knight lived unhappily\never after\u2026</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>The End\u2026</i>\n</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N:</b>\u00a0Yeah&hellip; now can you see why I couldn\u2019t just leave Seokjin heartbroken like that?

That evil king\nwould not leave his princess alone, and Seokjin had grown tired of him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat are you talking about?\u201d Seokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </i></p><p><i>Sumin remained silent, unsure if she should\nfinally tell him the truth. </i></p><p><i>After quickly debating, Sumin opened her\nmouth and said,</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Seokjin\neyed Sumin eagerly, wanting to know what that devilish king had done to her. He\nrested a loving hand on her shoulder, while the other hand rubbed her arm\ngently. </p><p>Encouraging\nwords left his lips in whispers as he patiently waited for her to start\ntalking. </p><p>Sumin\ninhaled, then exhaled. She repeated the process until the horrible anxiety left\nher tummy. </p><p>With\none last breath, she mustered enough courage and looked in her knight\u2019s eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAs I said earlier, it is King Ji\nYong. He had been sending me rather concerning letters, and they were always\naccompanied with red rose\u2026\u201d Sumin trailed on, trying to find the right words to\nsay next. The last thing she wanted was to trigger her lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as his eyes slowly closed. He calmed his sporadic breathing while\nthe anger slowly took control. No. Sumin did not deserve to be on the receiving\nend of his wrath. If anyone deserved the consequences of his fury, it was that\nstupid king that had yet to realize that Sumin was <i>his</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you have any of those letters?\nMay I see them?\u201d requested Seokjin, wanting to know the severity of these\n\u201clove\u201d letters. </p><p>Sumin\nnearly choked. A nervous smile graced her lips followed by a few forced chuckles.\nBoy\u2026how was she going to tell him that she had her dear nurse burn them? Would\nhe think she was hiding something from him? Wait\u2026scratch that\u2026 she technically\ndid hide something from him. </p><p>Damn\nit\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026 about that, my love\u2026 you see\u2026\nI\u2026um\u2026\u201d Sumin paused, fiddling with her engagement ring that hung nicely from\nthe silver chain around her neck, \u201cI may have had my\u2026um\u2026 nurse burn them\nbecause I did not want to worry you, my beloved.\u201d She finished, feeling a tiny\nweight lift off her shoulders. She no longer had to hide this terrible secret\nfrom him. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded slowly; his facial expression was practically unreadable. Uh-oh. That\nwas never a good sign with him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled as if she was on the verge of tears. Correction, she was already\ncrying. Her chest tightened as the thought of losing Seokjin frightened her to\nknow end. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am so sorry for lying to you,\nSeokjin. I was honestly terrified of the thought of me marrying someone who is\nnot you, and the more I dwell on that horrid idea, the more I fear that it will\ncome true,\u201d A choked like sob escaped her lips, \u201cI will not marry that cold,\ncalculating King Ji Yong. I do not love him, nor will I <i>ever</i> love him.\u201d Sumin firmly declared as tears continued to cascade\ndown her cheeks. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes flickered from concern to this sense of pride. He instantly captured her\nlips, not caring if his cheeks became stained with her tears. His heart soared\nfrom hearing your declaration. </p><p>Slowly,\nhe pulled away from his princess; a warm smile graced his lips as he did.</p><p>With\nnothing but pure love in his eyes, Seokjin stared at Sumin as his thumb gently\ncaressed her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be okay princess,\u201d He\nbegan, placing a soft kiss on her forehead, \u201cAs long as you wear that ring\naround your neck, I am not going anywhere. You and I will wed, and that is\nfinal. Nothing and no one will get in the way of that. I promise you.\u201d Seokjin\ndeclared as he gently lifted both of her hands and kissed her knuckles softly. </p><p>Sumin\nlooked at up with shaky eyes. Her heart warmed after his hearing his promise,\nhowever, in the back of her mind, she knew that it was worthless.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not make promises you cannot\nkeep\u2026\u201d She whispered as she eyed the stone walkway with nothing but utter\nsadness. </p><p>A\ndepressed sigh escaped his lips as Seokjin felt his heart break just a bit.\nSumin lacked faith in them right now, and it deeply hurt him. At the same time,\nhe understood why she felt that way. With a pending battle happening a lot\nsooner than they had hoped, anything could happen to him. Hell, he might not\neven come back alive. Just the mere thought of him lying on the cold\nground\u2014lifeless\u2014terrified them both, especially Sumin. She could not bear the\nthought of living on a world where her one true love was no longer present. </p><p>She was\nalready losing her father, and she would be damned if she lost her childhood\nsweetheart as well. </p><p>If she\ncould, she would ride into battle herself and end the war. No need to send her\nbeloved to the bloody warzone\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Seokjin noticed a familiar, scheming gleam in his\nprincess\u2019s eyes. He knew that she\u2019s toying with the idea of fighting in place\nof her father, but with his good conscious, Seokjin could not allow that. </p><p>Placing\nboth his index and middle fingers under her chin, Seokjin titled her head\nslightly. Their eyes met. Love glazed over them as they remained still. Their\nhearts beat as one as the sounds of waves crashing entered their ears. The soft\nocean breeze brushed past their bodies. Little by little the gap between their\nlips closed. Then, in just one kiss, they poured their entire\nlove\u2026admiration\u2026longing that had been building since they were mere children. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled Sumin closer, wanting nothing more to keep her close, as they continued\nto kiss. Sumin cupped Seokjin\u2019s face as she feared that he would disappear if\nshe didn\u2019t keep a firm hold on him. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, the lovers pulled apart yet remained holding each\nother. </p><p>With a\nloving smile, Sumin asked,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCould you accompany me back to my\nchambers, especially since we must part ways tomorrow at dawn.\u201d<br>\nA short yet soft scoff left his lips as Seokjin smiled warmly at his woman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never have to ask me to stay\nthe night since I will always say yes.\u201d He replied, placing a sweet kiss on her\ncheek.</p><p>Sumin\nsmiled brightly and intertwined their hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, shall we go to sleep, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>In a\nblink of an eye, the moon had faded behind the mountains, and the sun took its\nplace high in the sky. Sounds of birds singing their mating tune entered\nSumin\u2019s room. Tiny streaks of sunlight penetrated her ivory laced curtains,\ncreating beautiful shadow patterns on the cold floors, walls, and even her\nblankets. </p><p>A faint\ngroan was heard as the tired princess turned over, hoping to cuddle with her\ndear knight some more. Her arm landed on a soft padding rather semi-hard flesh.\nSumin pried one eye open and then the other immediately shot open. She quickly\nsat up and frantically searched for her Seokjin. Though, deep down, she knew\nthat he had already left in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Her\neyes sadly trailed down as tiny tears formed. She wanted to bid a fond farewell\nand send him off with a sweet kiss. Maybe even had given him a token to remind\nhim what and who he was fighting for. </p><p>Maybe\nit was for the best that he had left while she slumbered\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, she had noticed a faint blob of yellow. Sumin instantly\nturned towards the right, the side where Seokjin had slept peacefully since the\nday they had become lovers and saw a yellow rose on top of a letter. </p><p>A\ngentle smile slowly appeared on her face as she picked up the rose. She held\nthe flower up to her nostrils and inhaled its sweet scent. It was just like her\nknight to remember that she had grown fond of yellow roses. A special fact that\nJi Yong would never understand. </p><p>After\ntaking in the flowers scent for a few more minutes, Sumin finally lowered the\nflower. She then picked up the note and unfolded it. </p><p>Her\neyes widened. Her brows furrowed. She scanned the graciously written content\nand with each word, tears formed. </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndarling. My love. The keeper of my heart. The one and only princess for me. By\nthe time you are reading this letter, I have already left for the battlefield\nwith the support of our kingdom. I could not bear the thought of waking you up from\nyour precious slumber and bidding you a fond farewell in person. It honestly\ntook all of my strength to remove my arm from your precious waist. If I had the\nopportunity, I would gladly stay by your side and enjoy your smiles. Your\nlaughter. How your eyes light up whenever you are around me\u2026 Unfortunately, the\nHoly Father had other plans for me\u2026 I have but one request of you, my darling\nSumin\u2026 Please do not shed any tears for me. I will return from the battlefield\nvictorious, and you and I will be wedded. Until then, every time you feel the\nwind fan your face, think of its as my love. I had asked the Gods of nature to\nreceive my love and carry it to you. I love you so much. </i></p><p><i>Forever yours, </i></p><p><i>Seokjin.\u201d</i></p><p>Tears\nstreamed down her rosy cheeks the second she read the last line of Seokjin\u2019s\nletter. He loved her so much that he didn\u2019t want to wake her up. He wanted to\nremember her with no tear stains, so that\u2019s how she was going to honor his\nwish.</p><p>No more\ntears shall be shed. Only her endless amount of love would remain to be shown.</p><p>She\nwould put on a brave face and hold down the castle. That way, there would be a\ncastle for her beloved to return to. </p><p>With a\ndetermined smile, Sumin practically jumped out of bed and called for a servant.\nShe sat down in front of her mirror and picked up her sapphire encrusted\nhairbrush. She smoothed away her atrocious bed hair.</p><p>As she\nwas brushing her hair, the servant rushed inside her chambers. He quickly bowed\nand asked what he was needed for. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am in dire need to send Seokjin a\nletter. Pray tell me, where would he be stationed at?\u201d Sumin told the servant,\nasking where her knight is stationed on. </p><p>The\nservant\u2019s eyes widened, but he soon composed himself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin is currently at the\nmountain pass. Shall I fetch you a messenger?\u201d He asked, ready to anything and\neverything to make the princess pleased with him. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head as she stood up from her vanity mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to my father\u2019s study and\nwrite him a letter instead. I am sure my love would rather have a written reply\nrather than some man relaying it,\u201d She bowed her head, \u201cThank you, though. You\nmay go now.\u201d She said, politely dismissing the castle worker. </p><p>The\nservant quickly muttered, \u201cYes, your highness.\u201d, before exiting her chambers. </p><p>Sumin\nwaited to hear the door shut before dashing towards her wardrobe. She swiftly\npicked a pastel blue dress with a diamond accent detail. The diamonds were\nshaped as snowflakes that decorated the outer white laced skirt. </p><p>She\npaired the dress with navy blue heels and went for the simpler sapphire and\ndiamond crown. She placed the crown gently on top of her head as she walked out\nof her bedroom, ready to write the first of many letters for one true love\u2026</p><p>Minutes\nhad turned into hours, hours had turned into days and just like that, days had\nturned into weeks. </p><p>Those\nlong weeks without seeing her knight had been the most excruciating for\nPrincess Sumin. However, each time she received a letter from Seokjin, it made\nthose lonely nights bearable\u2014especially since they were always accompanied with\na yellow rose. </p><p>Each\ntime she smelled the sweet perfume of the rose, a warm smile graced her lips.\nHer heart warmed at the thought of feeling his love with each word he wrote in\nthe letters. </p><p>God,\nhow she missed him\u2026</p><p>Currently\nreading yet another of Seokjin\u2019s letter as she inhaled the hypnotic scent that\nthe flower had to offer, Sumin\u2019s thoughts had been interrupted when a castle\nworker stormed inside her room; his breath heavy and sporadic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d Sumin politely questioned the\nyoung man. </p><p>The\nworker quickly bowed his head in respect before speaking,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour highness. My deepest apologies\nfor the intrusion, but I have come here to announce that King Ji Yong shall be\narriving soon.\u201d</p><p>With\njust one little announcement, Sumin\u2019s world came crashing down. What\u2026no\u2026why was\nthat horrid king coming to visit? He had no reason to come\u2026unless\u2026he had found\nout about her father\u2019s worsening condition. No. There was no way because each\ncastle worker had been sworn to secrecy. No one would dare to defy the royal\nfamily\u2019s orders, so why had he come then?</p><p>Unless\u2026</p><p>He had\ncome for her hand in marriage\u2014again. Could he not leave an engaged woman alone?</p><p>Few\nseconds went by and nothing, but the ocean breeze was heard. Then, with a\ndignified smile, Sumin turned around and thanked the worker for his message.\nShe then dismissed him, telling him to carry on with his duties. The worker\nsmiled politely, bowed his head, and exited the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright, you annoying pest. Why are\nyou in my kingdom?\u201d Sumin muttered to herself as she walked to the one place\nshe had been lingering around for the past few weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith King Ji Yong, his carriage had just pulled up at the entrance. He peeked\nthrough the curtains with a scheming smirk. His plan would officially commence.\nHis plan of having the dear Princess Sumin standing with him at the altar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow dare that lowly, pathetic\nknight propose to <i>my</i> wife\u2026\u201d King Ji Yong\nthought bitterly as he roughly closed the curtains. He leaned back in his seat,\nrubbing his chin as he thought about the idea of marriage with Sumin. He would\nhave her one way or another. At this rate, he could care less if she married\nhim while sobbing. She would be his wife\u2014the mother of his children\u2026</p><p>Stepping\nout of the carriage, King Ji Yong quickly ordered his driver to go wait for him\nsomewhere else. The driver nodded and took off with the carriage. King Ji Yong\nthen began to walk towards the courtyard as he scanned the area for\nsomeone\u2014anyone. Luckily, he managed to find someone and with an intimidating\nstare, he asked the poor worker where the princess was at. Out of fear, the\nworker quickly said that the princess was in her father\u2019s study and pointed in\nthe direction of the room. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked in response and thanked the servant for his assistant. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am coming for you, my lovely\nprincess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Now holed\nin her father\u2019s study, Sumin dipped her quill in the ink jar and continued to\nwrite out intimate details to her love. She wrote how she longed for his touch.\nHow she longed for his sweet kisses. In short, how she longed for him to be her\nside. \u00a0</p><p>A smile\nof content formed on her lips as Sumin signed her name on the bottom of the\nparchment. She blew lightly on the ink, making sure it was dry before folding\nit up. As a little gift for her knight, she pressed her lips onto the\nparchment. She pulled away satisfied with the lip stain that displayed near her\nname. Seokjin would love that. </p><p>Just as\nshe poured a bit of hot wax onto the letter, a light knock entered her ears.\nHer brows raised. Her chest heaved. Something in the pit of her stomach told\nher that it was the one person she absolutely did not want to see that stood on\nthe other side of the door.</p><p>Sumin\nrolled her eyes before mustering a diplomatic smile and said, \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><p>Not\neven seconds later, King Ji Yong strolled in and closed the door behind him.\nSumin raised her brow, finding his actions rather odd. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKing Ji Yong, to what do I owe the\npleasure of your presence in my kingdom?\u201d asked Sumin as she bowed her head in\nrespect.</p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked, drinking in her splendid appearance. Sumin would forever be his\nmost prized possession. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I thought I should pay you\nvisit since I have desperately missed you.\u201d He replied as he walked over to her\nand lifted her chin. He wanted their eyes to meet. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit right and there. She despised his touch on her\nprecious skin. Her sacred body would forever be reserved for Seokjin only.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour majesty, I appreciate your\nsweet words but do refrain yourself from using them as I am now an engaged\nwoman.\u201d Sumin confessed; her eyes flickered with triumph.</p><p>However,\nthat sudden announcement did not waiver the scheming king. If anything, it made\nhim more determined to make sure that his plan succeeded. </p><p>King Ji\nYong nodded his head slowly. He took one step, then another until the gap\nclosed between them. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt vulnerable. She felt like a prey being backed into a corner by its\npredator. Every time he took a step, she took a step back until she felt her\nback hit the edge of the desk. Her hands gripped the corners, ready to pick up\nanything that she could stab this man with. She could care less of the\nconsequences right now. She was willing to kill this king if it meant not only\nher safety, but the entire kingdom\u2019s as well\u2014especially Seokjin\u2019s. She would go\nto war for that man, and it seemed like she was about to.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yes\u2026 I have heard that your\nfianc\u00e9 is fighting in your father\u2019s place. You know\u2026\u201d He began clicking his\ntongue in a condescending manner, \u201cIt is quite a pity that he is battling\nenemies that I have paid quite a sum to rage war against your people\u2026\u201d He\nconfessed, smirking evilly. </p><p>In that\nmoment, Sumin felt as if someone knocked the air right out of here. Had she\nheard him, right? Had he truly stooped so low to have paid a hefty sum just to\nrage war on her kingdom? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY-you what\u2026?\u201d Sumin questioned,\nstumbling over her words. </p><p>King Ji\nYong merely smirked in response, \u201cYou see, my dear princess,\u201d He stood in front\nher, trapping her between him and the desk, \u201cI am quite a jealous man, and the\nmoment I have set my eyes on you, I knew you were the wife for me.\u201d He declared\nwith an evil smirk. </p><p>Sumin\npractically snarled at the man. Her eyes narrowed, almost becoming slits. She\nwas officially done with this rude king. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will <i>never</i> be your wife, so as long as Seokjin continues to fight for\nhis life and for my people.\u201d She said, practically spitting in his face. </p><p>A soft\nscoff escaped his lips as King Ji Yong created a bit of space between them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, it would be quite hard to\nfight for your people if he is captured by the enemy and is currently waiting\nfor his execution.\u201d He confessed, taunting the fiery spirted princess.</p><p>Now, it\nfelt like someone stabbed her in the heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHis what?\u201d She said softly; her\nvoice practically a whisper. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou heard me\u2026\u201d King Jiyong remained\nsmirking. </p><p>No. </p><p>He was\nsafe. He had to be safe. </p><p>As if\nsomeone pulled the rug underneath her feet, Sumin collapsed onto the fall; her\nsobs became uncontrollable. Her heart pounded against her chase as it broke\nlittle by little. </p><p>King Ji\nYong had to be lying. He was cruel, deceitful, and dishonorable. No. She\nrefused to believe anything that came out his mouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re lying. He had been sending\nme letter practically every single day. There is no possible way that he could\nhave been captured by my father\u2019s enemies. No. I refuse to believe your petty\nlies.\u201d Sumin said as she tried her hardest to calm herself. </p><p>King Ji\nYong clicked his tongue yet again and looked at the princess with \u201csympathetic\u201d\neyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf only they were indeed lies,\u201d He\nthen gestured towards the desk, \u201cLook at the date at your knight\u2019s latest\nletter. I am almost certain that it had been weeks since he had sent that,\ncorrect?\u201d He finished, hiding the calculating grin that threatened to form. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him before scrambling up and fetching his letter. Her hands hurriedly\ngrabbed the piece of parchment paper. Her eyes homed in on the date written in\nthe top left corner. </p><p>Shit. </p><p>That\nstupid kind had been right. The day he wrote it and the day she had received\nit, it was indeed a few weeks later. </p><p>Nope. </p><p>This\nwas not going to happen. She had meant what she said about going to war for\nSeokjin. It seemed like the time had come. Time to draw her father\u2019s sword and\nfight for her man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!!\u201d She shouted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing, princess?\u201d King\nJi Yong inquired, raising his brow. </p><p>Sumin\nglared coldly at the man and ignored his question.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!\u201d She yelled once more.\nSeconds later, two guards rushed inside the office and bowed their heads and\nrespect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They\nanswered. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady my horse and tell the nurse\nto prepare my riding outfit.\u201d She ordered as the anger surged through her\nveins.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They replied\nbefore hurrying out of the office. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAgain, what are you doing, Princess\nSumin?\u201d King Ji Yong asked with a bored expression. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed loudly, completely fed up with the annoying man.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you must know, I plan to draw my\nfather\u2019s sword, ride into enemy lines, and fight for my knight. Now, if you\nkindly do not mind, I will take my leave.\u201d She stated, announcing her plans. </p><p>King Ji\nYong stared at her with an amused expression. He mentally counted down from\nten, allowing her to finish her little dramatic act. Then, just as she reached\nthe iron door handle, he spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually do not mind since anyone\nwith ears can tell you that your idea is terrible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nscoffed and turned around; her body now faced him. She crossed her arms over\nher chest and gave him an impatient look, wanting him to continue with whatever\nhe has to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour idea is rather horrid since\nthere is no way those ruthless generals would ever listen to a mere princess\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed on, pausing for effect, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut they would listen to a queen.\u201d\nKing Ji Yong finished with a devilish smirk.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes widened. Confusion painted on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMarry me, Princess Sumin and with a\nsnap of my finger, the war will be over. Say yes to being my queen, and your\nprecious Seokjin will return home unharmed.\u201d King Ji Yong said, staring her\ndown. </p><p>Sumin\npanted; she felt this unspeakable heavy burden crush her shoulders. Her heart\nraced as her palms became clammy. Tears began to fill the brim of her eyes. Too\nmany thoughts flooded her mind. She questioned her morals but soon dismissed\nevery single one of them. At the end of the day, she would do everything and\nanything to ensure the safety of her kingdom and the people that inhabited the\nland. Yes. She knew what must be done. </p><p>She met\nthe cold King\u2019s gaze and walked towards him. Taking one final deep breath, Sumin\nsaid,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><p>King Ji\nYong\u2019s brow perked up as an intrigued smirk appeared on his face. He wrapped an\narm around her shoulders and pulled her closer; the possessiveness in his stare\nwas ever so visible. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou made a wise decision,\u201d He\npressed his lips against her temple, \u201cI promise that I will call of the war\nfirst thing tomorrow morning.\u201d He whispered \u201csweetly\u201d in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched as she forced a smile at her new fianc\u00e9.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease forgive me my love\u2026\u201d She\nthought sadly as Seokjin\u2019s handsome face flashed once in her mind.</p><p>Few\ndays later, in a camp zone filled with many tents, horses, and men practicing\ntheir swordsmanship, Seokjin studied the battle map once more. His body had\nlittle to no wounds, and he was safe. Unknown to Sumin, King Ji Yong had lied\nabout Seokjin\u2019s wellbeing. He was never captured by the enemy and awaited his\nexecution. No. He spun the truth. In fact, it was actually the enemy general\nthat was captured by Seokjin\u2019s men and brought for trial. The enemy had been tried\nfor treason against Sumin\u2019s kingdom and was sentenced to death. </p><p>Too\nabsorbed in the map\u2019s details, Seokjin muttered different plans of attack to\nhimself, wondering which route he should take. Suddenly, a loud wave of cheers\nwas heard. His curiosity had gotten the best of him, and Seokjin walked out of\nhis tent.</p><p>The\nmoment he stepped outside, Seokjin instantly saw bright smiles and tears of joy\nspilled out of his men. </p><p>Now, he\nbecame even more confused. </p><p>Seokjin\nquickly grabbed one of his soldiers and demanded that he tell him what was\ngoing on. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe war, sir. It is finished.\u201d The\nsolider announced with a bright smile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, \u201cWhat do you mean that the war is over?\u201d He asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOne of the other enemy generals has\noffered his unconditional surrender. Then, eventually, the rest of them\nfollowed suit. The war is over, my lord.\u201d The soldier happily explained before\nrunning over to his friends to celebrate some more. </p><p>Seokjin\nscoffed softly yet a smile of relief graced his face. The battle was over, and\nthat meant that he was allowed to go home\u2014to go back to Sumin. </p><p>Yet,\nsomething in the back of his mind would not leave him alone. While he was\noverjoyed with the battle being over, something told him that this war should\nnot have ended easily. This bloody battle should not have ended in less than a\nmonth\u2026</p><p>Then,\nrealization struck him. This had the work of that evil King Ji Yong written all\nover it. </p><p>Seokjin\ndashed towards his horse and swiftly rushed back to the kingdom, silently\npraying that he was not too late. From where he had been stationed at, it would\ntake him a little over two days to get back to Sumin\u2019s kingdom, however, instead\nof allowing that to fill his heart with anxiety, he instead used it fuel his\nadrenaline\u2014his determination\u2014and increased the speed of his horse. He had to\nget back to his princess\u2014his one true love\u2026</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith Sumin, she stared blankly at her reflection; this emotionless wave washed\nover her eyes. She looked dead. She felt dead to be honest. Both on the inside\nand on the outside. She was about to marry someone she did not love nor; would\nshe ever love. </p><p>She\nfelt her hair being pulled in different directions. She watched her maids pin\nevery curl into different spots until they were satisfied with how their\nprincess looked. Her hair had been decorated with diamonds, that were shaped as\nflowers. Her crown rested nicely on top of her hand while her lacey veil\nshielded her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cP-princess\u2026 it is time to put on\nyour dress.\u201d Sumin heard one of her maids announce. </p><p>Sumin\nturned away from the mirror and forced a smile. While they were busy preparing\nher hair and makeup, Sumin had heard them sniffling and taking deeps breaths.\nHer maids, especially her nurse, hated seeing their beloved princess looking so\ndead. Their hearts ached for Sumin as they desperately wished that they could\ndo something to stop this wedding. They always dreamt of helping their princess\nget ready for her wedding, but in their minds, the wedding was for her and\nSeokjin. Not her and King Ji Yong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess permit me to speak.\u201d The\nnurse asked as she guided Sumin towards her dress.</p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response, allowing the nurse to speak her mind.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt breaks my heart to see you this\nway. I pray to the Holy Father that he will put a stop to this ceremony. You do\nnot deserve to marry such a despicable man.\u201d The nurse said; her eyes dripped\nwith concern. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled before she bit her bottom lip. She was doing a great job at not\nbreaking down and sobbing. She was not going to start now. She had to remain\nstrong for everyone dear in her life. </p><p>She\nsmiles softly and places a warm hand on the nurse\u2019s cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u2026\u201d She said\nsoftly, maintaining her smile. </p><p>The\nnurse sniffled. Tears filled the brims of her eyes. </p><p>Naturally,\nSumin too began to tear up. However, she wiped them away before it could ruin\nher makeup. She then reminded herself that she was doing this for Seokjin\u2019s\nsafety. Once this was all over, Seokjin would be safe and back in the kingdom.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will forgive you, Sumin. He\nwill\u2026\u201d She thought while she felt a few of the maids lace up the corset. </p><p>One of\nthe maids then instructed that she stepped inside her wedding skirt. Sumin\nobediently followed their directions until her body had been completely covered\nby the ceremonial gown.</p><p>Sumin\nslowly turned around and faced the mirror. Her eyes observed her reflection. All\nthis time, she had pictured herself in this dress for her marriage to Seokjin.\nA part of her wished that she had picked out a different dress for her marriage\nto King Ji Yong, but it was too late. </p><p>Time\nwas something that was never on her side. What would make her wedding day any\ndifferent?</p><p>The\nnurse and maids bowed their head in respect, not wanting Sumin to see them\ncrying. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs the carriage ready? I am ready\nto embark on this journey to wifehood.\u201d Sumin muttered, staring at the floor\nsadly. </p><p>The\nnurse nodded and escorted her out of the room.</p><p>Outside\nwas King Ji Yong\u2019s knights, ready to escort the princess to the church. King Ji\nYong had ordered them to make sure that Sumin would not try any funny business\nor run, leaving him at the altar. He was only minutes away from having Sumin as\nhis bride. Nothing and no one would stop him now\u2026</p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, Seokjin had finally arrived back to the kingdom. He\npractically hopped off his horse and dashed inside the castle grounds. His eyes\nhurriedly scanned, hoping to find anyone who would know the whereabouts of the\nprincess. He began to lose hope as nobody was seen in the courtyard. </p><p>Luckily,\nhis eye homed in on a familiar face. Princess Sumin\u2019s dear and beloved nurse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d Seokjin hollered as he ran\nup to her. </p><p>The\nnurse\u2019s eyes widened. A look of shocked washed over her face as she slowly\nbecame confused. What was Sumin\u2019s knight doing here?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin?!\u201d The nurse shouted\nback as she looked over the knight\u2019s body, hoping to find any signs of being\ntortured. \u201cYou are alive and well? But? How is that possible?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nbrows furrowed, \u201cOf course, I am alive. Whatever that horrid King Ji Yong has\nsaid, it is nothing but lies. Now, tell me, where is Sumin? I must show her\nthat I am alive and safe.\u201d He demanded, panting. </p><p>The\nnurse stared at him with sympathetic eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am sorry, Seokjin, but the\nprincess is on her way to the church. She might be even already there.\u201d She explained,\nfearing that all hope was lost. </p><p>However,\nSeokjin refused to admit defeat. He was ready to fight King Ji Yong if he had\nto. </p><p>He quickly\nuttered a \u201cthanks\u201d before rushing back to his horse and riding towards the\nchurch. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not marry him, Sumin. Just hold\non\u2026\u201d He anxiously thought.</p><p>With\nthe church in his sight, Seokjin increased the speed of his horse. His heart\nraced with both anxiety and adrenaline as the church steps appeared in front of\nhim. He then pulled on the reins and halted his horse\u2019s steps. </p><p>Seokjin\njumped off his horse and ran up the stairs. He pushed open the church doors and\nunfortunately, his heart shattered into a million of pieces. He froze in his\nplace as his eyes widened. His fingers trembled as his breathing became\nsporadic. </p><p>There\nhe stood, watching the love of his life kiss someone else. King Ji Yong had\nwon. He had won <i>his</i> princess\u2019s hand\nin marriage. That son of a bitch\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI present you their royal\nmajesties, King Ji Yong and his Queen Sumin.\u201d The priest announced; though, he\ntried his best to sound happy. He saw Sumin\u2019s body language, and it screamed at\nhim to put a stop to the ceremony. Now, the priest would live with this guilt\nfor the rest of his life. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmind screamed at him to leave the church, but for some reason his feet refused\nto listen to him. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhis eyes caught Sumin\u2019s gaze. Due to being far away, Seokjin could not see the\nbrokenness and despair in her eyes. To him, she was filled with joy. To her,\nshe was depressed, defeated, and above all\u2026she was surprised to see Seokjin\nalive and unharmed. Confusion filled her mind as her eyes switched from her\nknight to her now husband. </p><p>At that\nmoment, she felt like an idiot. She angrily turned towards her <i>husband</i> but before she could demand him\nto tell her the truth, King Ji Yong roughly pulled her closer and whispered a\nbone chilling threat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you do anything rash, I will\nhave my men kill your knight where he stands. Now, do you really want bloodshed\non our wedding day?\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nfought back her tears, even though a few of them had already cascaded down her\nrosy cheeks. She shook her head, closing her eyes briefly. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smiled and kissed her head sweetly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d He said softly with a creepy\ngrin. </p><p>Sumin\nopened her eyes and met Seokjin\u2019s gaze one last time. With a sad smile, she\nmouthed, </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nforced a smile and mouthed, \u201cI love you too\u2026\u201d</p><p>He flickered\nhis gaze onto King Ji Yong, who was now smirking proudly, before turning his\nback towards the \u201chappy\u201d couple. </p><p>He\nopened the doors and walked away, leaving behind the cheers and lively applause\u2026</p><p><i>And the princess and her knight lived unhappily\never after\u2026</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>The End\u2026</i>\n</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N:</b>\u00a0Yeah\u2026 now can you see why I couldn\u2019t just leave Seokjin heartbroken like that?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn\u2019t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart\u2019s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her. Will her bodyguard continue to fight for her or is it finally her turn?</small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Previously: </b><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175791445214/fight-for-me-ch1\">ch.1</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175887448405/fight-for-me-ch2\">ch.2</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/175993838175/fight-for-me-ch3\">ch.3</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176061680692/fight-for-me-ch4\">ch.4</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176129746496/fight-for-me-ch5\">ch.5</a> | <a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/176200520359/fight-for-me-ch6\">ch.6</a><br></small></p><p><small>\u203b <b>Next Time:</b> The Sequel: <i><a href=\"http://jinniesbby.tumblr.com/post/177276444294/our-second-chance-ch1\">Our Second Chance</a>\u00a0</i></small></p><hr><h2><i>Final Chapter: So, the Princess &amp; Her Knight\u2026</i></h2>[[MORE]]<p><i>Previously</i></p><p><i>Seokjin heard Sumin\u2019s sporadic breathing and\npulled her into a loving embrace. He rested his chin on top of her head and\nuttered words of love and comfort. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\ndo not want to marry that horrid King Ji Yong. I will not!\u201d Sumin declared,\nalerting Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>Upon hearing his name, Seokjin\u2019s body\nimmediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury engulfed his body. That evil king\nwould not leave his princess alone, and Seokjin had grown tired of him. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSumin,\nwhat are you talking about?\u201d Seokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </i></p><p><i>Sumin remained silent, unsure if she should\nfinally tell him the truth. </i></p><p><i>After quickly debating, Sumin opened her\nmouth and said,</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\nis King Ji Yong\u2026 he\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Seokjin\neyed Sumin eagerly, wanting to know what that devilish king had done to her. He\nrested a loving hand on her shoulder, while the other hand rubbed her arm\ngently. </p><p>Encouraging\nwords left his lips in whispers as he patiently waited for her to start\ntalking. </p><p>Sumin\ninhaled, then exhaled. She repeated the process until the horrible anxiety left\nher tummy. </p><p>With\none last breath, she mustered enough courage and looked in her knight\u2019s eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAs I said earlier, it is King Ji\nYong. He had been sending me rather concerning letters, and they were always\naccompanied with red rose\u2026\u201d Sumin trailed on, trying to find the right words to\nsay next. The last thing she wanted was to trigger her lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as his eyes slowly closed. He calmed his sporadic breathing while\nthe anger slowly took control. No. Sumin did not deserve to be on the receiving\nend of his wrath. If anyone deserved the consequences of his fury, it was that\nstupid king that had yet to realize that Sumin was <i>his</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you have any of those letters?\nMay I see them?\u201d requested Seokjin, wanting to know the severity of these\n\u201clove\u201d letters. </p><p>Sumin\nnearly choked. A nervous smile graced her lips followed by a few forced chuckles.\nBoy\u2026how was she going to tell him that she had her dear nurse burn them? Would\nhe think she was hiding something from him? Wait\u2026scratch that\u2026 she technically\ndid hide something from him. </p><p>Damn\nit\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026 about that, my love\u2026 you see\u2026\nI\u2026um\u2026\u201d Sumin paused, fiddling with her engagement ring that hung nicely from\nthe silver chain around her neck, \u201cI may have had my\u2026um\u2026 nurse burn them\nbecause I did not want to worry you, my beloved.\u201d She finished, feeling a tiny\nweight lift off her shoulders. She no longer had to hide this terrible secret\nfrom him. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded slowly; his facial expression was practically unreadable. Uh-oh. That\nwas never a good sign with him. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled as if she was on the verge of tears. Correction, she was already\ncrying. Her chest tightened as the thought of losing Seokjin frightened her to\nknow end. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am so sorry for lying to you,\nSeokjin. I was honestly terrified of the thought of me marrying someone who is\nnot you, and the more I dwell on that horrid idea, the more I fear that it will\ncome true,\u201d A choked like sob escaped her lips, \u201cI will not marry that cold,\ncalculating King Ji Yong. I do not love him, nor will I <i>ever</i> love him.\u201d Sumin firmly declared as tears continued to cascade\ndown her cheeks. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\neyes flickered from concern to this sense of pride. He instantly captured her\nlips, not caring if his cheeks became stained with her tears. His heart soared\nfrom hearing your declaration. </p><p>Slowly,\nhe pulled away from his princess; a warm smile graced his lips as he did.</p><p>With\nnothing but pure love in his eyes, Seokjin stared at Sumin as his thumb gently\ncaressed her cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt will be okay princess,\u201d He\nbegan, placing a soft kiss on her forehead, \u201cAs long as you wear that ring\naround your neck, I am not going anywhere. You and I will wed, and that is\nfinal. Nothing and no one will get in the way of that. I promise you.\u201d Seokjin\ndeclared as he gently lifted both of her hands and kissed her knuckles softly. </p><p>Sumin\nlooked at up with shaky eyes. Her heart warmed after his hearing his promise,\nhowever, in the back of her mind, she knew that it was worthless.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not make promises you cannot\nkeep\u2026\u201d She whispered as she eyed the stone walkway with nothing but utter\nsadness. </p><p>A\ndepressed sigh escaped his lips as Seokjin felt his heart break just a bit.\nSumin lacked faith in them right now, and it deeply hurt him. At the same time,\nhe understood why she felt that way. With a pending battle happening a lot\nsooner than they had hoped, anything could happen to him. Hell, he might not\neven come back alive. Just the mere thought of him lying on the cold\nground\u2014lifeless\u2014terrified them both, especially Sumin. She could not bear the\nthought of living on a world where her one true love was no longer present. </p><p>She was\nalready losing her father, and she would be damned if she lost her childhood\nsweetheart as well. </p><p>If she\ncould, she would ride into battle herself and end the war. No need to send her\nbeloved to the bloody warzone\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Seokjin noticed a familiar, scheming gleam in his\nprincess\u2019s eyes. He knew that she\u2019s toying with the idea of fighting in place\nof her father, but with his good conscious, Seokjin could not allow that. </p><p>Placing\nboth his index and middle fingers under her chin, Seokjin titled her head\nslightly. Their eyes met. Love glazed over them as they remained still. Their\nhearts beat as one as the sounds of waves crashing entered their ears. The soft\nocean breeze brushed past their bodies. Little by little the gap between their\nlips closed. Then, in just one kiss, they poured their entire\nlove\u2026admiration\u2026longing that had been building since they were mere children. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled Sumin closer, wanting nothing more to keep her close, as they continued\nto kiss. Sumin cupped Seokjin\u2019s face as she feared that he would disappear if\nshe didn\u2019t keep a firm hold on him. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, the lovers pulled apart yet remained holding each\nother. </p><p>With a\nloving smile, Sumin asked,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCould you accompany me back to my\nchambers, especially since we must part ways tomorrow at dawn.\u201d<br>\nA short yet soft scoff left his lips as Seokjin smiled warmly at his woman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never have to ask me to stay\nthe night since I will always say yes.\u201d He replied, placing a sweet kiss on her\ncheek.</p><p>Sumin\nsmiled brightly and intertwined their hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, shall we go to sleep, my\nlove?\u201d </p><p>In a\nblink of an eye, the moon had faded behind the mountains, and the sun took its\nplace high in the sky. Sounds of birds singing their mating tune entered\nSumin\u2019s room. Tiny streaks of sunlight penetrated her ivory laced curtains,\ncreating beautiful shadow patterns on the cold floors, walls, and even her\nblankets. </p><p>A faint\ngroan was heard as the tired princess turned over, hoping to cuddle with her\ndear knight some more. Her arm landed on a soft padding rather semi-hard flesh.\nSumin pried one eye open and then the other immediately shot open. She quickly\nsat up and frantically searched for her Seokjin. Though, deep down, she knew\nthat he had already left in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Her\neyes sadly trailed down as tiny tears formed. She wanted to bid a fond farewell\nand send him off with a sweet kiss. Maybe even had given him a token to remind\nhim what and who he was fighting for. </p><p>Maybe\nit was for the best that he had left while she slumbered\u2026</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, she had noticed a faint blob of yellow. Sumin instantly\nturned towards the right, the side where Seokjin had slept peacefully since the\nday they had become lovers and saw a yellow rose on top of a letter. </p><p>A\ngentle smile slowly appeared on her face as she picked up the rose. She held\nthe flower up to her nostrils and inhaled its sweet scent. It was just like her\nknight to remember that she had grown fond of yellow roses. A special fact that\nJi Yong would never understand. </p><p>After\ntaking in the flowers scent for a few more minutes, Sumin finally lowered the\nflower. She then picked up the note and unfolded it. </p><p>Her\neyes widened. Her brows furrowed. She scanned the graciously written content\nand with each word, tears formed. </p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy\ndarling. My love. The keeper of my heart. The one and only princess for me. By\nthe time you are reading this letter, I have already left for the battlefield\nwith the support of our kingdom. I could not bear the thought of waking you up from\nyour precious slumber and bidding you a fond farewell in person. It honestly\ntook all of my strength to remove my arm from your precious waist. If I had the\nopportunity, I would gladly stay by your side and enjoy your smiles. Your\nlaughter. How your eyes light up whenever you are around me\u2026 Unfortunately, the\nHoly Father had other plans for me\u2026 I have but one request of you, my darling\nSumin\u2026 Please do not shed any tears for me. I will return from the battlefield\nvictorious, and you and I will be wedded. Until then, every time you feel the\nwind fan your face, think of its as my love. I had asked the Gods of nature to\nreceive my love and carry it to you. I love you so much. </i></p><p><i>Forever yours, </i></p><p><i>Seokjin.\u201d</i></p><p>Tears\nstreamed down her rosy cheeks the second she read the last line of Seokjin\u2019s\nletter. He loved her so much that he didn\u2019t want to wake her up. He wanted to\nremember her with no tear stains, so that\u2019s how she was going to honor his\nwish.</p><p>No more\ntears shall be shed. Only her endless amount of love would remain to be shown.</p><p>She\nwould put on a brave face and hold down the castle. That way, there would be a\ncastle for her beloved to return to. </p><p>With a\ndetermined smile, Sumin practically jumped out of bed and called for a servant.\nShe sat down in front of her mirror and picked up her sapphire encrusted\nhairbrush. She smoothed away her atrocious bed hair.</p><p>As she\nwas brushing her hair, the servant rushed inside her chambers. He quickly bowed\nand asked what he was needed for. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am in dire need to send Seokjin a\nletter. Pray tell me, where would he be stationed at?\u201d Sumin told the servant,\nasking where her knight is stationed on. </p><p>The\nservant\u2019s eyes widened, but he soon composed himself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin is currently at the\nmountain pass. Shall I fetch you a messenger?\u201d He asked, ready to anything and\neverything to make the princess pleased with him. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head as she stood up from her vanity mirror. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will go to my father\u2019s study and\nwrite him a letter instead. I am sure my love would rather have a written reply\nrather than some man relaying it,\u201d She bowed her head, \u201cThank you, though. You\nmay go now.\u201d She said, politely dismissing the castle worker. </p><p>The\nservant quickly muttered, \u201cYes, your highness.\u201d, before exiting her chambers. </p><p>Sumin\nwaited to hear the door shut before dashing towards her wardrobe. She swiftly\npicked a pastel blue dress with a diamond accent detail. The diamonds were\nshaped as snowflakes that decorated the outer white laced skirt. </p><p>She\npaired the dress with navy blue heels and went for the simpler sapphire and\ndiamond crown. She placed the crown gently on top of her head as she walked out\nof her bedroom, ready to write the first of many letters for one true love\u2026</p><p>Minutes\nhad turned into hours, hours had turned into days and just like that, days had\nturned into weeks. </p><p>Those\nlong weeks without seeing her knight had been the most excruciating for\nPrincess Sumin. However, each time she received a letter from Seokjin, it made\nthose lonely nights bearable\u2014especially since they were always accompanied with\na yellow rose. </p><p>Each\ntime she smelled the sweet perfume of the rose, a warm smile graced her lips.\nHer heart warmed at the thought of feeling his love with each word he wrote in\nthe letters. </p><p>God,\nhow she missed him\u2026</p><p>Currently\nreading yet another of Seokjin\u2019s letter as she inhaled the hypnotic scent that\nthe flower had to offer, Sumin\u2019s thoughts had been interrupted when a castle\nworker stormed inside her room; his breath heavy and sporadic. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d Sumin politely questioned the\nyoung man. </p><p>The\nworker quickly bowed his head in respect before speaking,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour highness. My deepest apologies\nfor the intrusion, but I have come here to announce that King Ji Yong shall be\narriving soon.\u201d</p><p>With\njust one little announcement, Sumin\u2019s world came crashing down. What\u2026no\u2026why was\nthat horrid king coming to visit? He had no reason to come\u2026unless\u2026he had found\nout about her father\u2019s worsening condition. No. There was no way because each\ncastle worker had been sworn to secrecy. No one would dare to defy the royal\nfamily\u2019s orders, so why had he come then?</p><p>Unless\u2026</p><p>He had\ncome for her hand in marriage\u2014again. Could he not leave an engaged woman alone?</p><p>Few\nseconds went by and nothing, but the ocean breeze was heard. Then, with a\ndignified smile, Sumin turned around and thanked the worker for his message.\nShe then dismissed him, telling him to carry on with his duties. The worker\nsmiled politely, bowed his head, and exited the room. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright, you annoying pest. Why are\nyou in my kingdom?\u201d Sumin muttered to herself as she walked to the one place\nshe had been lingering around for the past few weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith King Ji Yong, his carriage had just pulled up at the entrance. He peeked\nthrough the curtains with a scheming smirk. His plan would officially commence.\nHis plan of having the dear Princess Sumin standing with him at the altar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow dare that lowly, pathetic\nknight propose to <i>my</i> wife\u2026\u201d King Ji Yong\nthought bitterly as he roughly closed the curtains. He leaned back in his seat,\nrubbing his chin as he thought about the idea of marriage with Sumin. He would\nhave her one way or another. At this rate, he could care less if she married\nhim while sobbing. She would be his wife\u2014the mother of his children\u2026</p><p>Stepping\nout of the carriage, King Ji Yong quickly ordered his driver to go wait for him\nsomewhere else. The driver nodded and took off with the carriage. King Ji Yong\nthen began to walk towards the courtyard as he scanned the area for\nsomeone\u2014anyone. Luckily, he managed to find someone and with an intimidating\nstare, he asked the poor worker where the princess was at. Out of fear, the\nworker quickly said that the princess was in her father\u2019s study and pointed in\nthe direction of the room. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked in response and thanked the servant for his assistant. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am coming for you, my lovely\nprincess\u2026\u201d</p><p>Now holed\nin her father\u2019s study, Sumin dipped her quill in the ink jar and continued to\nwrite out intimate details to her love. She wrote how she longed for his touch.\nHow she longed for his sweet kisses. In short, how she longed for him to be her\nside. \u00a0</p><p>A smile\nof content formed on her lips as Sumin signed her name on the bottom of the\nparchment. She blew lightly on the ink, making sure it was dry before folding\nit up. As a little gift for her knight, she pressed her lips onto the\nparchment. She pulled away satisfied with the lip stain that displayed near her\nname. Seokjin would love that. </p><p>Just as\nshe poured a bit of hot wax onto the letter, a light knock entered her ears.\nHer brows raised. Her chest heaved. Something in the pit of her stomach told\nher that it was the one person she absolutely did not want to see that stood on\nthe other side of the door.</p><p>Sumin\nrolled her eyes before mustering a diplomatic smile and said, \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><p>Not\neven seconds later, King Ji Yong strolled in and closed the door behind him.\nSumin raised her brow, finding his actions rather odd. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKing Ji Yong, to what do I owe the\npleasure of your presence in my kingdom?\u201d asked Sumin as she bowed her head in\nrespect.</p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked, drinking in her splendid appearance. Sumin would forever be his\nmost prized possession. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I thought I should pay you\nvisit since I have desperately missed you.\u201d He replied as he walked over to her\nand lifted her chin. He wanted their eyes to meet. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit right and there. She despised his touch on her\nprecious skin. Her sacred body would forever be reserved for Seokjin only.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour majesty, I appreciate your\nsweet words but do refrain yourself from using them as I am now an engaged\nwoman.\u201d Sumin confessed; her eyes flickered with triumph.</p><p>However,\nthat sudden announcement did not waiver the scheming king. If anything, it made\nhim more determined to make sure that his plan succeeded. </p><p>King Ji\nYong nodded his head slowly. He took one step, then another until the gap\nclosed between them. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt vulnerable. She felt like a prey being backed into a corner by its\npredator. Every time he took a step, she took a step back until she felt her\nback hit the edge of the desk. Her hands gripped the corners, ready to pick up\nanything that she could stab this man with. She could care less of the\nconsequences right now. She was willing to kill this king if it meant not only\nher safety, but the entire kingdom\u2019s as well\u2014especially Seokjin\u2019s. She would go\nto war for that man, and it seemed like she was about to.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh yes\u2026 I have heard that your\nfianc\u00e9 is fighting in your father\u2019s place. You know\u2026\u201d He began clicking his\ntongue in a condescending manner, \u201cIt is quite a pity that he is battling\nenemies that I have paid quite a sum to rage war against your people\u2026\u201d He\nconfessed, smirking evilly. </p><p>In that\nmoment, Sumin felt as if someone knocked the air right out of here. Had she\nheard him, right? Had he truly stooped so low to have paid a hefty sum just to\nrage war on her kingdom? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cY-you what\u2026?\u201d Sumin questioned,\nstumbling over her words. </p><p>King Ji\nYong merely smirked in response, \u201cYou see, my dear princess,\u201d He stood in front\nher, trapping her between him and the desk, \u201cI am quite a jealous man, and the\nmoment I have set my eyes on you, I knew you were the wife for me.\u201d He declared\nwith an evil smirk. </p><p>Sumin\npractically snarled at the man. Her eyes narrowed, almost becoming slits. She\nwas officially done with this rude king. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI will <i>never</i> be your wife, so as long as Seokjin continues to fight for\nhis life and for my people.\u201d She said, practically spitting in his face. </p><p>A soft\nscoff escaped his lips as King Ji Yong created a bit of space between them. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, it would be quite hard to\nfight for your people if he is captured by the enemy and is currently waiting\nfor his execution.\u201d He confessed, taunting the fiery spirted princess.</p><p>Now, it\nfelt like someone stabbed her in the heart. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHis what?\u201d She said softly; her\nvoice practically a whisper. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou heard me\u2026\u201d King Jiyong remained\nsmirking. </p><p>No. </p><p>He was\nsafe. He had to be safe. </p><p>As if\nsomeone pulled the rug underneath her feet, Sumin collapsed onto the fall; her\nsobs became uncontrollable. Her heart pounded against her chase as it broke\nlittle by little. </p><p>King Ji\nYong had to be lying. He was cruel, deceitful, and dishonorable. No. She\nrefused to believe anything that came out his mouth. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re lying. He had been sending\nme letter practically every single day. There is no possible way that he could\nhave been captured by my father\u2019s enemies. No. I refuse to believe your petty\nlies.\u201d Sumin said as she tried her hardest to calm herself. </p><p>King Ji\nYong clicked his tongue yet again and looked at the princess with \u201csympathetic\u201d\neyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf only they were indeed lies,\u201d He\nthen gestured towards the desk, \u201cLook at the date at your knight\u2019s latest\nletter. I am almost certain that it had been weeks since he had sent that,\ncorrect?\u201d He finished, hiding the calculating grin that threatened to form. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him before scrambling up and fetching his letter. Her hands hurriedly\ngrabbed the piece of parchment paper. Her eyes homed in on the date written in\nthe top left corner. </p><p>Shit. </p><p>That\nstupid kind had been right. The day he wrote it and the day she had received\nit, it was indeed a few weeks later. </p><p>Nope. </p><p>This\nwas not going to happen. She had meant what she said about going to war for\nSeokjin. It seemed like the time had come. Time to draw her father\u2019s sword and\nfight for her man. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!!\u201d She shouted.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you doing, princess?\u201d King\nJi Yong inquired, raising his brow. </p><p>Sumin\nglared coldly at the man and ignored his question.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuards!\u201d She yelled once more.\nSeconds later, two guards rushed inside the office and bowed their heads and\nrespect. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They\nanswered. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cReady my horse and tell the nurse\nto prepare my riding outfit.\u201d She ordered as the anger surged through her\nveins.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, Princess Sumin.\u201d They replied\nbefore hurrying out of the office. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAgain, what are you doing, Princess\nSumin?\u201d King Ji Yong asked with a bored expression. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed loudly, completely fed up with the annoying man.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you must know, I plan to draw my\nfather\u2019s sword, ride into enemy lines, and fight for my knight. Now, if you\nkindly do not mind, I will take my leave.\u201d She stated, announcing her plans. </p><p>King Ji\nYong stared at her with an amused expression. He mentally counted down from\nten, allowing her to finish her little dramatic act. Then, just as she reached\nthe iron door handle, he spoke. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI actually do not mind since anyone\nwith ears can tell you that your idea is terrible.\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nscoffed and turned around; her body now faced him. She crossed her arms over\nher chest and gave him an impatient look, wanting him to continue with whatever\nhe has to say. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour idea is rather horrid since\nthere is no way those ruthless generals would ever listen to a mere princess\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed on, pausing for effect, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut they would listen to a queen.\u201d\nKing Ji Yong finished with a devilish smirk.</p><p>Sumin\u2019s\neyes widened. Confusion painted on her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMarry me, Princess Sumin and with a\nsnap of my finger, the war will be over. Say yes to being my queen, and your\nprecious Seokjin will return home unharmed.\u201d King Ji Yong said, staring her\ndown. </p><p>Sumin\npanted; she felt this unspeakable heavy burden crush her shoulders. Her heart\nraced as her palms became clammy. Tears began to fill the brim of her eyes. Too\nmany thoughts flooded her mind. She questioned her morals but soon dismissed\nevery single one of them. At the end of the day, she would do everything and\nanything to ensure the safety of her kingdom and the people that inhabited the\nland. Yes. She knew what must be done. </p><p>She met\nthe cold King\u2019s gaze and walked towards him. Taking one final deep breath, Sumin\nsaid,</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d</p><p>King Ji\nYong\u2019s brow perked up as an intrigued smirk appeared on his face. He wrapped an\narm around her shoulders and pulled her closer; the possessiveness in his stare\nwas ever so visible. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou made a wise decision,\u201d He\npressed his lips against her temple, \u201cI promise that I will call of the war\nfirst thing tomorrow morning.\u201d He whispered \u201csweetly\u201d in her ear. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nbreath hitched as she forced a smile at her new fianc\u00e9.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlease forgive me my love\u2026\u201d She\nthought sadly as Seokjin\u2019s handsome face flashed once in her mind.</p><p>Few\ndays later, in a camp zone filled with many tents, horses, and men practicing\ntheir swordsmanship, Seokjin studied the battle map once more. His body had\nlittle to no wounds, and he was safe. Unknown to Sumin, King Ji Yong had lied\nabout Seokjin\u2019s wellbeing. He was never captured by the enemy and awaited his\nexecution. No. He spun the truth. In fact, it was actually the enemy general\nthat was captured by Seokjin\u2019s men and brought for trial. The enemy had been tried\nfor treason against Sumin\u2019s kingdom and was sentenced to death. </p><p>Too\nabsorbed in the map\u2019s details, Seokjin muttered different plans of attack to\nhimself, wondering which route he should take. Suddenly, a loud wave of cheers\nwas heard. His curiosity had gotten the best of him, and Seokjin walked out of\nhis tent.</p><p>The\nmoment he stepped outside, Seokjin instantly saw bright smiles and tears of joy\nspilled out of his men. </p><p>Now, he\nbecame even more confused. </p><p>Seokjin\nquickly grabbed one of his soldiers and demanded that he tell him what was\ngoing on. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe war, sir. It is finished.\u201d The\nsolider announced with a bright smile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, \u201cWhat do you mean that the war is over?\u201d He asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOne of the other enemy generals has\noffered his unconditional surrender. Then, eventually, the rest of them\nfollowed suit. The war is over, my lord.\u201d The soldier happily explained before\nrunning over to his friends to celebrate some more. </p><p>Seokjin\nscoffed softly yet a smile of relief graced his face. The battle was over, and\nthat meant that he was allowed to go home\u2014to go back to Sumin. </p><p>Yet,\nsomething in the back of his mind would not leave him alone. While he was\noverjoyed with the battle being over, something told him that this war should\nnot have ended easily. This bloody battle should not have ended in less than a\nmonth\u2026</p><p>Then,\nrealization struck him. This had the work of that evil King Ji Yong written all\nover it. </p><p>Seokjin\ndashed towards his horse and swiftly rushed back to the kingdom, silently\npraying that he was not too late. From where he had been stationed at, it would\ntake him a little over two days to get back to Sumin\u2019s kingdom, however, instead\nof allowing that to fill his heart with anxiety, he instead used it fuel his\nadrenaline\u2014his determination\u2014and increased the speed of his horse. He had to\nget back to his princess\u2014his one true love\u2026</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith Sumin, she stared blankly at her reflection; this emotionless wave washed\nover her eyes. She looked dead. She felt dead to be honest. Both on the inside\nand on the outside. She was about to marry someone she did not love nor; would\nshe ever love. </p><p>She\nfelt her hair being pulled in different directions. She watched her maids pin\nevery curl into different spots until they were satisfied with how their\nprincess looked. Her hair had been decorated with diamonds, that were shaped as\nflowers. Her crown rested nicely on top of her hand while her lacey veil\nshielded her face. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cP-princess\u2026 it is time to put on\nyour dress.\u201d Sumin heard one of her maids announce. </p><p>Sumin\nturned away from the mirror and forced a smile. While they were busy preparing\nher hair and makeup, Sumin had heard them sniffling and taking deeps breaths.\nHer maids, especially her nurse, hated seeing their beloved princess looking so\ndead. Their hearts ached for Sumin as they desperately wished that they could\ndo something to stop this wedding. They always dreamt of helping their princess\nget ready for her wedding, but in their minds, the wedding was for her and\nSeokjin. Not her and King Ji Yong. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPrincess permit me to speak.\u201d The\nnurse asked as she guided Sumin towards her dress.</p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response, allowing the nurse to speak her mind.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt breaks my heart to see you this\nway. I pray to the Holy Father that he will put a stop to this ceremony. You do\nnot deserve to marry such a despicable man.\u201d The nurse said; her eyes dripped\nwith concern. </p><p>Sumin\u2019s\nlips trembled before she bit her bottom lip. She was doing a great job at not\nbreaking down and sobbing. She was not going to start now. She had to remain\nstrong for everyone dear in her life. </p><p>She\nsmiles softly and places a warm hand on the nurse\u2019s cheek.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u2026\u201d She said\nsoftly, maintaining her smile. </p><p>The\nnurse sniffled. Tears filled the brims of her eyes. </p><p>Naturally,\nSumin too began to tear up. However, she wiped them away before it could ruin\nher makeup. She then reminded herself that she was doing this for Seokjin\u2019s\nsafety. Once this was all over, Seokjin would be safe and back in the kingdom.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe will forgive you, Sumin. He\nwill\u2026\u201d She thought while she felt a few of the maids lace up the corset. </p><p>One of\nthe maids then instructed that she stepped inside her wedding skirt. Sumin\nobediently followed their directions until her body had been completely covered\nby the ceremonial gown.</p><p>Sumin\nslowly turned around and faced the mirror. Her eyes observed her reflection. All\nthis time, she had pictured herself in this dress for her marriage to Seokjin.\nA part of her wished that she had picked out a different dress for her marriage\nto King Ji Yong, but it was too late. </p><p>Time\nwas something that was never on her side. What would make her wedding day any\ndifferent?</p><p>The\nnurse and maids bowed their head in respect, not wanting Sumin to see them\ncrying. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs the carriage ready? I am ready\nto embark on this journey to wifehood.\u201d Sumin muttered, staring at the floor\nsadly. </p><p>The\nnurse nodded and escorted her out of the room.</p><p>Outside\nwas King Ji Yong\u2019s knights, ready to escort the princess to the church. King Ji\nYong had ordered them to make sure that Sumin would not try any funny business\nor run, leaving him at the altar. He was only minutes away from having Sumin as\nhis bride. Nothing and no one would stop him now\u2026</p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, Seokjin had finally arrived back to the kingdom. He\npractically hopped off his horse and dashed inside the castle grounds. His eyes\nhurriedly scanned, hoping to find anyone who would know the whereabouts of the\nprincess. He began to lose hope as nobody was seen in the courtyard. </p><p>Luckily,\nhis eye homed in on a familiar face. Princess Sumin\u2019s dear and beloved nurse. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNurse!\u201d Seokjin hollered as he ran\nup to her. </p><p>The\nnurse\u2019s eyes widened. A look of shocked washed over her face as she slowly\nbecame confused. What was Sumin\u2019s knight doing here?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSir Seokjin?!\u201d The nurse shouted\nback as she looked over the knight\u2019s body, hoping to find any signs of being\ntortured. \u201cYou are alive and well? But? How is that possible?\u201d She questioned. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nbrows furrowed, \u201cOf course, I am alive. Whatever that horrid King Ji Yong has\nsaid, it is nothing but lies. Now, tell me, where is Sumin? I must show her\nthat I am alive and safe.\u201d He demanded, panting. </p><p>The\nnurse stared at him with sympathetic eyes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI am sorry, Seokjin, but the\nprincess is on her way to the church. She might be even already there.\u201d She explained,\nfearing that all hope was lost. </p><p>However,\nSeokjin refused to admit defeat. He was ready to fight King Ji Yong if he had\nto. </p><p>He quickly\nuttered a \u201cthanks\u201d before rushing back to his horse and riding towards the\nchurch. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo not marry him, Sumin. Just hold\non\u2026\u201d He anxiously thought.</p><p>With\nthe church in his sight, Seokjin increased the speed of his horse. His heart\nraced with both anxiety and adrenaline as the church steps appeared in front of\nhim. He then pulled on the reins and halted his horse\u2019s steps. </p><p>Seokjin\njumped off his horse and ran up the stairs. He pushed open the church doors and\nunfortunately, his heart shattered into a million of pieces. He froze in his\nplace as his eyes widened. His fingers trembled as his breathing became\nsporadic. </p><p>There\nhe stood, watching the love of his life kiss someone else. King Ji Yong had\nwon. He had won <i>his</i> princess\u2019s hand\nin marriage. That son of a bitch\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI present you their royal\nmajesties, King Ji Yong and his Queen Sumin.\u201d The priest announced; though, he\ntried his best to sound happy. He saw Sumin\u2019s body language, and it screamed at\nhim to put a stop to the ceremony. Now, the priest would live with this guilt\nfor the rest of his life. </p><p>Seokjin\u2019s\nmind screamed at him to leave the church, but for some reason his feet refused\nto listen to him. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhis eyes caught Sumin\u2019s gaze. Due to being far away, Seokjin could not see the\nbrokenness and despair in her eyes. To him, she was filled with joy. To her,\nshe was depressed, defeated, and above all\u2026she was surprised to see Seokjin\nalive and unharmed. Confusion filled her mind as her eyes switched from her\nknight to her now husband. </p><p>At that\nmoment, she felt like an idiot. She angrily turned towards her <i>husband</i> but before she could demand him\nto tell her the truth, King Ji Yong roughly pulled her closer and whispered a\nbone chilling threat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you do anything rash, I will\nhave my men kill your knight where he stands. Now, do you really want bloodshed\non our wedding day?\u201d </p><p>Sumin\nfought back her tears, even though a few of them had already cascaded down her\nrosy cheeks. She shook her head, closing her eyes briefly. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smiled and kissed her head sweetly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d He said softly with a creepy\ngrin. </p><p>Sumin\nopened her eyes and met Seokjin\u2019s gaze one last time. With a sad smile, she\nmouthed, </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI love you.\u201d </p><p>Seokjin\nforced a smile and mouthed, \u201cI love you too\u2026\u201d</p><p>He flickered\nhis gaze onto King Ji Yong, who was now smirking proudly, before turning his\nback towards the \u201chappy\u201d couple. </p><p>He\nopened the doors and walked away, leaving behind the cheers and lively applause\u2026</p><p><i>And the princess and her knight lived unhappily\never after\u2026</i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>The End\u2026</i>\n</p><hr><p><small><b>A/N:</b>\u00a0Yeah\u2026 now can you see why I couldn\u2019t just leave Seokjin heartbroken like that?

In that kingdom, the royal family had the freedom of marrying whoever his or her royal highness deems worthy. Now, of course, having that special privilege came with some interesting challenges, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop a certain head-strong princess from doing whatever her heart&rsquo;s desire, especially when she has her heart set on marrying her personal bodyguard. Unfortunately, her beliefs might face some hardships when a certain king sets his eye on her.

He rested his chin on top of her head and\nuttered words of love and comfort. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I\ndo not want to marry that horrid King Ji Yong. I will not!&rdquo; Sumin declared,\nalerting Seokjin.</i></p><p><i>Upon hearing his name, Seokjin&rsquo;s body\nimmediately tensed, and a sudden wave of fury engulfed his body. That evil king\nwould not leave his princess alone, and Seokjin had grown tired of him. </i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sumin,\nwhat are you talking about?&rdquo; Seokjin inquired, glancing down at her. </i></p><p><i>Sumin remained silent, unsure if she should\nfinally tell him the truth. </i></p><p><i>After quickly debating, Sumin opened her\nmouth and said,</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It\nis King Ji Yong&hellip; he&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p>Seokjin\neyed Sumin eagerly, wanting to know what that devilish king had done to her. He\nrested a loving hand on her shoulder, while the other hand rubbed her arm\ngently. </p><p>Encouraging\nwords left his lips in whispers as he patiently waited for her to start\ntalking. </p><p>Sumin\ninhaled, then exhaled. She repeated the process until the horrible anxiety left\nher tummy. </p><p>With\none last breath, she mustered enough courage and looked in her knight&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;As I said earlier, it is King Ji\nYong. He had been sending me rather concerning letters, and they were always\naccompanied with red rose&hellip;&rdquo; Sumin trailed on, trying to find the right words to\nsay next. The last thing she wanted was to trigger her lover. </p><p>Seokjin\nsighed deeply as his eyes slowly closed. He calmed his sporadic breathing while\nthe anger slowly took control. No. Sumin did not deserve to be on the receiving\nend of his wrath. If anyone deserved the consequences of his fury, it was that\nstupid king that had yet to realize that Sumin was <i>his</i>. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have any of those letters?\nMay I see them?&rdquo; requested Seokjin, wanting to know the severity of these\n&ldquo;love&rdquo; letters. </p><p>Sumin\nnearly choked. A nervous smile graced her lips followed by a few forced chuckles.\nBoy&hellip;how was she going to tell him that she had her dear nurse burn them? Would\nhe think she was hiding something from him? Wait&hellip;scratch that&hellip; she technically\ndid hide something from him. </p><p>Damn\nit&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Um&hellip; about that, my love&hellip; you see&hellip;\nI&hellip;um&hellip;&rdquo; Sumin paused, fiddling with her engagement ring that hung nicely from\nthe silver chain around her neck, &ldquo;I may have had my&hellip;um&hellip; nurse burn them\nbecause I did not want to worry you, my beloved.&rdquo; She finished, feeling a tiny\nweight lift off her shoulders. She no longer had to hide this terrible secret\nfrom him. </p><p>Seokjin\nnodded slowly; his facial expression was practically unreadable. Uh-oh. That\nwas never a good sign with him. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nlips trembled as if she was on the verge of tears. Correction, she was already\ncrying. Her chest tightened as the thought of losing Seokjin frightened her to\nknow end. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am so sorry for lying to you,\nSeokjin. I was honestly terrified of the thought of me marrying someone who is\nnot you, and the more I dwell on that horrid idea, the more I fear that it will\ncome true,&rdquo; A choked like sob escaped her lips, &ldquo;I will not marry that cold,\ncalculating King Ji Yong. I do not love him, nor will I <i>ever</i> love him.&rdquo; Sumin firmly declared as tears continued to cascade\ndown her cheeks. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\neyes flickered from concern to this sense of pride. He instantly captured her\nlips, not caring if his cheeks became stained with her tears. His heart soared\nfrom hearing your declaration. </p><p>Slowly,\nhe pulled away from his princess; a warm smile graced his lips as he did.</p><p>With\nnothing but pure love in his eyes, Seokjin stared at Sumin as his thumb gently\ncaressed her cheek.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It will be okay princess,&rdquo; He\nbegan, placing a soft kiss on her forehead, &ldquo;As long as you wear that ring\naround your neck, I am not going anywhere. You and I will wed, and that is\nfinal. Nothing and no one will get in the way of that. I promise you.&rdquo; Seokjin\ndeclared as he gently lifted both of her hands and kissed her knuckles softly. </p><p>Sumin\nlooked at up with shaky eyes. Her heart warmed after his hearing his promise,\nhowever, in the back of her mind, she knew that it was worthless.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do not make promises you cannot\nkeep&hellip;&rdquo; She whispered as she eyed the stone walkway with nothing but utter\nsadness. </p><p>A\ndepressed sigh escaped his lips as Seokjin felt his heart break just a bit.\nSumin lacked faith in them right now, and it deeply hurt him. At the same time,\nhe understood why she felt that way. With a pending battle happening a lot\nsooner than they had hoped, anything could happen to him. Hell, he might not\neven come back alive. Just the mere thought of him lying on the cold\nground&mdash;lifeless&mdash;terrified them both, especially Sumin. She could not bear the\nthought of living on a world where her one true love was no longer present. </p><p>She was\nalready losing her father, and she would be damned if she lost her childhood\nsweetheart as well. </p><p>If she\ncould, she would ride into battle herself and end the war. No need to send her\nbeloved to the bloody warzone&hellip;</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of his eye, Seokjin noticed a familiar, scheming gleam in his\nprincess&rsquo;s eyes. He knew that she&rsquo;s toying with the idea of fighting in place\nof her father, but with his good conscious, Seokjin could not allow that. </p><p>Placing\nboth his index and middle fingers under her chin, Seokjin titled her head\nslightly. Their eyes met. Love glazed over them as they remained still. Their\nhearts beat as one as the sounds of waves crashing entered their ears. The soft\nocean breeze brushed past their bodies. Little by little the gap between their\nlips closed. Then, in just one kiss, they poured their entire\nlove&hellip;admiration&hellip;longing that had been building since they were mere children. </p><p>Seokjin\npulled Sumin closer, wanting nothing more to keep her close, as they continued\nto kiss. Sumin cupped Seokjin&rsquo;s face as she feared that he would disappear if\nshe didn&rsquo;t keep a firm hold on him. </p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, the lovers pulled apart yet remained holding each\nother. </p><p>With a\nloving smile, Sumin asked,</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Could you accompany me back to my\nchambers, especially since we must part ways tomorrow at dawn.&rdquo;<br />\nA short yet soft scoff left his lips as Seokjin smiled warmly at his woman. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You never have to ask me to stay\nthe night since I will always say yes.&rdquo; He replied, placing a sweet kiss on her\ncheek.</p><p>Sumin\nsmiled brightly and intertwined their hands. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, shall we go to sleep, my\nlove?&rdquo; </p><p>In a\nblink of an eye, the moon had faded behind the mountains, and the sun took its\nplace high in the sky. Sounds of birds singing their mating tune entered\nSumin&rsquo;s room. Tiny streaks of sunlight penetrated her ivory laced curtains,\ncreating beautiful shadow patterns on the cold floors, walls, and even her\nblankets. </p><p>A faint\ngroan was heard as the tired princess turned over, hoping to cuddle with her\ndear knight some more. Her arm landed on a soft padding rather semi-hard flesh.\nSumin pried one eye open and then the other immediately shot open. She quickly\nsat up and frantically searched for her Seokjin. Though, deep down, she knew\nthat he had already left in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>Her\neyes sadly trailed down as tiny tears formed. She wanted to bid a fond farewell\nand send him off with a sweet kiss. Maybe even had given him a token to remind\nhim what and who he was fighting for. </p><p>Maybe\nit was for the best that he had left while she slumbered&hellip;</p><p>Out of\nthe corner of her eye, she had noticed a faint blob of yellow. Sumin instantly\nturned towards the right, the side where Seokjin had slept peacefully since the\nday they had become lovers and saw a yellow rose on top of a letter. </p><p>A\ngentle smile slowly appeared on her face as she picked up the rose. She held\nthe flower up to her nostrils and inhaled its sweet scent. It was just like her\nknight to remember that she had grown fond of yellow roses. A special fact that\nJi Yong would never understand. </p><p>After\ntaking in the flowers scent for a few more minutes, Sumin finally lowered the\nflower. She then picked up the note and unfolded it. </p><p>Her\neyes widened. Her brows furrowed. She scanned the graciously written content\nand with each word, tears formed. </p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;My\ndarling. My love. The keeper of my heart. The one and only princess for me. By\nthe time you are reading this letter, I have already left for the battlefield\nwith the support of our kingdom. I could not bear the thought of waking you up from\nyour precious slumber and bidding you a fond farewell in person. It honestly\ntook all of my strength to remove my arm from your precious waist. If I had the\nopportunity, I would gladly stay by your side and enjoy your smiles. Your\nlaughter. How your eyes light up whenever you are around me&hellip; Unfortunately, the\nHoly Father had other plans for me&hellip; I have but one request of you, my darling\nSumin&hellip; Please do not shed any tears for me. I will return from the battlefield\nvictorious, and you and I will be wedded. Until then, every time you feel the\nwind fan your face, think of its as my love. I had asked the Gods of nature to\nreceive my love and carry it to you. I love you so much. </i></p><p><i>Forever yours, </i></p><p><i>Seokjin.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Tears\nstreamed down her rosy cheeks the second she read the last line of Seokjin&rsquo;s\nletter. He loved her so much that he didn&rsquo;t want to wake her up. He wanted to\nremember her with no tear stains, so that&rsquo;s how she was going to honor his\nwish.</p><p>No more\ntears shall be shed. Only her endless amount of love would remain to be shown.</p><p>She\nwould put on a brave face and hold down the castle. That way, there would be a\ncastle for her beloved to return to. </p><p>With a\ndetermined smile, Sumin practically jumped out of bed and called for a servant.\nShe sat down in front of her mirror and picked up her sapphire encrusted\nhairbrush. She smoothed away her atrocious bed hair.</p><p>As she\nwas brushing her hair, the servant rushed inside her chambers. He quickly bowed\nand asked what he was needed for. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am in dire need to send Seokjin a\nletter. Pray tell me, where would he be stationed at?&rdquo; Sumin told the servant,\nasking where her knight is stationed on. </p><p>The\nservant&rsquo;s eyes widened, but he soon composed himself. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sir Seokjin is currently at the\nmountain pass. Shall I fetch you a messenger?&rdquo; He asked, ready to anything and\neverything to make the princess pleased with him. </p><p>Sumin\nshook her head as she stood up from her vanity mirror. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will go to my father&rsquo;s study and\nwrite him a letter instead. I am sure my love would rather have a written reply\nrather than some man relaying it,&rdquo; She bowed her head, &ldquo;Thank you, though. You\nmay go now.&rdquo; She said, politely dismissing the castle worker. </p><p>The\nservant quickly muttered, &ldquo;Yes, your highness.&rdquo;, before exiting her chambers. </p><p>Sumin\nwaited to hear the door shut before dashing towards her wardrobe. She swiftly\npicked a pastel blue dress with a diamond accent detail. The diamonds were\nshaped as snowflakes that decorated the outer white laced skirt. </p><p>She\npaired the dress with navy blue heels and went for the simpler sapphire and\ndiamond crown. She placed the crown gently on top of her head as she walked out\nof her bedroom, ready to write the first of many letters for one true love&hellip;</p><p>Minutes\nhad turned into hours, hours had turned into days and just like that, days had\nturned into weeks. </p><p>Those\nlong weeks without seeing her knight had been the most excruciating for\nPrincess Sumin. However, each time she received a letter from Seokjin, it made\nthose lonely nights bearable&mdash;especially since they were always accompanied with\na yellow rose. </p><p>Each\ntime she smelled the sweet perfume of the rose, a warm smile graced her lips.\nHer heart warmed at the thought of feeling his love with each word he wrote in\nthe letters. </p><p>God,\nhow she missed him&hellip;</p><p>Currently\nreading yet another of Seokjin&rsquo;s letter as she inhaled the hypnotic scent that\nthe flower had to offer, Sumin&rsquo;s thoughts had been interrupted when a castle\nworker stormed inside her room; his breath heavy and sporadic. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Sumin politely questioned the\nyoung man. </p><p>The\nworker quickly bowed his head in respect before speaking,</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your highness. My deepest apologies\nfor the intrusion, but I have come here to announce that King Ji Yong shall be\narriving soon.&rdquo;</p><p>With\njust one little announcement, Sumin&rsquo;s world came crashing down. What&hellip;no&hellip;why was\nthat horrid king coming to visit? He had no reason to come&hellip;unless&hellip;he had found\nout about her father&rsquo;s worsening condition. No. There was no way because each\ncastle worker had been sworn to secrecy. No one would dare to defy the royal\nfamily&rsquo;s orders, so why had he come then?</p><p>Unless&hellip;</p><p>He had\ncome for her hand in marriage&mdash;again. Could he not leave an engaged woman alone?</p><p>Few\nseconds went by and nothing, but the ocean breeze was heard. Then, with a\ndignified smile, Sumin turned around and thanked the worker for his message.\nShe then dismissed him, telling him to carry on with his duties. The worker\nsmiled politely, bowed his head, and exited the room. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Alright, you annoying pest. Why are\nyou in my kingdom?&rdquo; Sumin muttered to herself as she walked to the one place\nshe had been lingering around for the past few weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith King Ji Yong, his carriage had just pulled up at the entrance. He peeked\nthrough the curtains with a scheming smirk. His plan would officially commence.\nHis plan of having the dear Princess Sumin standing with him at the altar. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;How dare that lowly, pathetic\nknight propose to <i>my</i> wife&hellip;&rdquo; King Ji Yong\nthought bitterly as he roughly closed the curtains. He leaned back in his seat,\nrubbing his chin as he thought about the idea of marriage with Sumin. He would\nhave her one way or another. At this rate, he could care less if she married\nhim while sobbing. She would be his wife&mdash;the mother of his children&hellip;</p><p>Stepping\nout of the carriage, King Ji Yong quickly ordered his driver to go wait for him\nsomewhere else. The driver nodded and took off with the carriage. King Ji Yong\nthen began to walk towards the courtyard as he scanned the area for\nsomeone&mdash;anyone. Luckily, he managed to find someone and with an intimidating\nstare, he asked the poor worker where the princess was at. Out of fear, the\nworker quickly said that the princess was in her father&rsquo;s study and pointed in\nthe direction of the room. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked in response and thanked the servant for his assistant. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am coming for you, my lovely\nprincess&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Now holed\nin her father&rsquo;s study, Sumin dipped her quill in the ink jar and continued to\nwrite out intimate details to her love. She wrote how she longed for his touch.\nHow she longed for his sweet kisses. In short, how she longed for him to be her\nside. &nbsp;</p><p>A smile\nof content formed on her lips as Sumin signed her name on the bottom of the\nparchment. She blew lightly on the ink, making sure it was dry before folding\nit up. As a little gift for her knight, she pressed her lips onto the\nparchment. She pulled away satisfied with the lip stain that displayed near her\nname. Seokjin would love that. </p><p>Just as\nshe poured a bit of hot wax onto the letter, a light knock entered her ears.\nHer brows raised. Her chest heaved. Something in the pit of her stomach told\nher that it was the one person she absolutely did not want to see that stood on\nthe other side of the door.</p><p>Sumin\nrolled her eyes before mustering a diplomatic smile and said, &ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;</p><p>Not\neven seconds later, King Ji Yong strolled in and closed the door behind him.\nSumin raised her brow, finding his actions rather odd. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;King Ji Yong, to what do I owe the\npleasure of your presence in my kingdom?&rdquo; asked Sumin as she bowed her head in\nrespect.</p><p>King Ji\nYong smirked, drinking in her splendid appearance. Sumin would forever be his\nmost prized possession. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, I thought I should pay you\nvisit since I have desperately missed you.&rdquo; He replied as he walked over to her\nand lifted her chin. He wanted their eyes to meet. </p><p>Sumin\nfought the urge to vomit right and there. She despised his touch on her\nprecious skin. Her sacred body would forever be reserved for Seokjin only.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your majesty, I appreciate your\nsweet words but do refrain yourself from using them as I am now an engaged\nwoman.&rdquo; Sumin confessed; her eyes flickered with triumph.</p><p>However,\nthat sudden announcement did not waiver the scheming king. If anything, it made\nhim more determined to make sure that his plan succeeded. </p><p>King Ji\nYong nodded his head slowly. He took one step, then another until the gap\nclosed between them. </p><p>Sumin\nfelt vulnerable. She felt like a prey being backed into a corner by its\npredator. Every time he took a step, she took a step back until she felt her\nback hit the edge of the desk. Her hands gripped the corners, ready to pick up\nanything that she could stab this man with. She could care less of the\nconsequences right now. She was willing to kill this king if it meant not only\nher safety, but the entire kingdom&rsquo;s as well&mdash;especially Seokjin&rsquo;s. She would go\nto war for that man, and it seemed like she was about to.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes&hellip; I have heard that your\nfianc&eacute; is fighting in your father&rsquo;s place. You know&hellip;&rdquo; He began clicking his\ntongue in a condescending manner, &ldquo;It is quite a pity that he is battling\nenemies that I have paid quite a sum to rage war against your people&hellip;&rdquo; He\nconfessed, smirking evilly. </p><p>In that\nmoment, Sumin felt as if someone knocked the air right out of here. Had she\nheard him, right? Had he truly stooped so low to have paid a hefty sum just to\nrage war on her kingdom? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Y-you what&hellip;?&rdquo; Sumin questioned,\nstumbling over her words. </p><p>King Ji\nYong merely smirked in response, &ldquo;You see, my dear princess,&rdquo; He stood in front\nher, trapping her between him and the desk, &ldquo;I am quite a jealous man, and the\nmoment I have set my eyes on you, I knew you were the wife for me.&rdquo; He declared\nwith an evil smirk. </p><p>Sumin\npractically snarled at the man. Her eyes narrowed, almost becoming slits. She\nwas officially done with this rude king. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will <i>never</i> be your wife, so as long as Seokjin continues to fight for\nhis life and for my people.&rdquo; She said, practically spitting in his face. </p><p>A soft\nscoff escaped his lips as King Ji Yong created a bit of space between them. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, it would be quite hard to\nfight for your people if he is captured by the enemy and is currently waiting\nfor his execution.&rdquo; He confessed, taunting the fiery spirted princess.</p><p>Now, it\nfelt like someone stabbed her in the heart. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;His what?&rdquo; She said softly; her\nvoice practically a whisper. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You heard me&hellip;&rdquo; King Jiyong remained\nsmirking. </p><p>No. </p><p>He was\nsafe. He had to be safe. </p><p>As if\nsomeone pulled the rug underneath her feet, Sumin collapsed onto the fall; her\nsobs became uncontrollable. Her heart pounded against her chase as it broke\nlittle by little. </p><p>King Ji\nYong had to be lying. He was cruel, deceitful, and dishonorable. No. She\nrefused to believe anything that came out his mouth. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying. He had been sending\nme letter practically every single day. There is no possible way that he could\nhave been captured by my father&rsquo;s enemies. No. I refuse to believe your petty\nlies.&rdquo; Sumin said as she tried her hardest to calm herself. </p><p>King Ji\nYong clicked his tongue yet again and looked at the princess with &ldquo;sympathetic&rdquo;\neyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If only they were indeed lies,&rdquo; He\nthen gestured towards the desk, &ldquo;Look at the date at your knight&rsquo;s latest\nletter. I am almost certain that it had been weeks since he had sent that,\ncorrect?&rdquo; He finished, hiding the calculating grin that threatened to form. </p><p>Sumin\nstared at him before scrambling up and fetching his letter. Her hands hurriedly\ngrabbed the piece of parchment paper. Her eyes homed in on the date written in\nthe top left corner. </p><p>Shit. </p><p>That\nstupid kind had been right. The day he wrote it and the day she had received\nit, it was indeed a few weeks later. </p><p>Nope. </p><p>This\nwas not going to happen. She had meant what she said about going to war for\nSeokjin. It seemed like the time had come. Time to draw her father&rsquo;s sword and\nfight for her man. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Guards!!&rdquo; She shouted.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing, princess?&rdquo; King\nJi Yong inquired, raising his brow. </p><p>Sumin\nglared coldly at the man and ignored his question.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Guards!&rdquo; She yelled once more.\nSeconds later, two guards rushed inside the office and bowed their heads and\nrespect. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Princess Sumin.&rdquo; They\nanswered. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ready my horse and tell the nurse\nto prepare my riding outfit.&rdquo; She ordered as the anger surged through her\nveins.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Princess Sumin.&rdquo; They replied\nbefore hurrying out of the office. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Again, what are you doing, Princess\nSumin?&rdquo; King Ji Yong asked with a bored expression. </p><p>Sumin\nsighed loudly, completely fed up with the annoying man.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If you must know, I plan to draw my\nfather&rsquo;s sword, ride into enemy lines, and fight for my knight. Now, if you\nkindly do not mind, I will take my leave.&rdquo; She stated, announcing her plans. </p><p>King Ji\nYong stared at her with an amused expression. He mentally counted down from\nten, allowing her to finish her little dramatic act. Then, just as she reached\nthe iron door handle, he spoke. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I actually do not mind since anyone\nwith ears can tell you that your idea is terrible.&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin\nscoffed and turned around; her body now faced him. She crossed her arms over\nher chest and gave him an impatient look, wanting him to continue with whatever\nhe has to say. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your idea is rather horrid since\nthere is no way those ruthless generals would ever listen to a mere princess&hellip;&rdquo;\nHe trailed on, pausing for effect, &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But they would listen to a queen.&rdquo;\nKing Ji Yong finished with a devilish smirk.</p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\neyes widened. Confusion painted on her face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Marry me, Princess Sumin and with a\nsnap of my finger, the war will be over. Say yes to being my queen, and your\nprecious Seokjin will return home unharmed.&rdquo; King Ji Yong said, staring her\ndown. </p><p>Sumin\npanted; she felt this unspeakable heavy burden crush her shoulders. Her heart\nraced as her palms became clammy. Tears began to fill the brim of her eyes. Too\nmany thoughts flooded her mind. She questioned her morals but soon dismissed\nevery single one of them. At the end of the day, she would do everything and\nanything to ensure the safety of her kingdom and the people that inhabited the\nland. Yes. She knew what must be done. </p><p>She met\nthe cold King&rsquo;s gaze and walked towards him. Taking one final deep breath, Sumin\nsaid,</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>King Ji\nYong&rsquo;s brow perked up as an intrigued smirk appeared on his face. He wrapped an\narm around her shoulders and pulled her closer; the possessiveness in his stare\nwas ever so visible. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You made a wise decision,&rdquo; He\npressed his lips against her temple, &ldquo;I promise that I will call of the war\nfirst thing tomorrow morning.&rdquo; He whispered &ldquo;sweetly&rdquo; in her ear. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nbreath hitched as she forced a smile at her new fianc&eacute;.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Please forgive me my love&hellip;&rdquo; She\nthought sadly as Seokjin&rsquo;s handsome face flashed once in her mind.</p><p>Few\ndays later, in a camp zone filled with many tents, horses, and men practicing\ntheir swordsmanship, Seokjin studied the battle map once more. His body had\nlittle to no wounds, and he was safe. Unknown to Sumin, King Ji Yong had lied\nabout Seokjin&rsquo;s wellbeing. He was never captured by the enemy and awaited his\nexecution. No. He spun the truth. In fact, it was actually the enemy general\nthat was captured by Seokjin&rsquo;s men and brought for trial. The enemy had been tried\nfor treason against Sumin&rsquo;s kingdom and was sentenced to death. </p><p>Too\nabsorbed in the map&rsquo;s details, Seokjin muttered different plans of attack to\nhimself, wondering which route he should take. Suddenly, a loud wave of cheers\nwas heard. His curiosity had gotten the best of him, and Seokjin walked out of\nhis tent.</p><p>The\nmoment he stepped outside, Seokjin instantly saw bright smiles and tears of joy\nspilled out of his men. </p><p>Now, he\nbecame even more confused. </p><p>Seokjin\nquickly grabbed one of his soldiers and demanded that he tell him what was\ngoing on. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The war, sir. It is finished.&rdquo; The\nsolider announced with a bright smile. </p><p>Seokjin\nraised his brow, &ldquo;What do you mean that the war is over?&rdquo; He asked. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;One of the other enemy generals has\noffered his unconditional surrender. Then, eventually, the rest of them\nfollowed suit. The war is over, my lord.&rdquo; The soldier happily explained before\nrunning over to his friends to celebrate some more. </p><p>Seokjin\nscoffed softly yet a smile of relief graced his face. The battle was over, and\nthat meant that he was allowed to go home&mdash;to go back to Sumin. </p><p>Yet,\nsomething in the back of his mind would not leave him alone. While he was\noverjoyed with the battle being over, something told him that this war should\nnot have ended easily. This bloody battle should not have ended in less than a\nmonth&hellip;</p><p>Then,\nrealization struck him. This had the work of that evil King Ji Yong written all\nover it. </p><p>Seokjin\ndashed towards his horse and swiftly rushed back to the kingdom, silently\npraying that he was not too late. From where he had been stationed at, it would\ntake him a little over two days to get back to Sumin&rsquo;s kingdom, however, instead\nof allowing that to fill his heart with anxiety, he instead used it fuel his\nadrenaline&mdash;his determination&mdash;and increased the speed of his horse. He had to\nget back to his princess&mdash;his one true love&hellip;</p><p>Meanwhile,\nwith Sumin, she stared blankly at her reflection; this emotionless wave washed\nover her eyes. She looked dead. She felt dead to be honest. Both on the inside\nand on the outside. She was about to marry someone she did not love nor; would\nshe ever love. </p><p>She\nfelt her hair being pulled in different directions. She watched her maids pin\nevery curl into different spots until they were satisfied with how their\nprincess looked. Her hair had been decorated with diamonds, that were shaped as\nflowers. Her crown rested nicely on top of her hand while her lacey veil\nshielded her face. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;P-princess&hellip; it is time to put on\nyour dress.&rdquo; Sumin heard one of her maids announce. </p><p>Sumin\nturned away from the mirror and forced a smile. While they were busy preparing\nher hair and makeup, Sumin had heard them sniffling and taking deeps breaths.\nHer maids, especially her nurse, hated seeing their beloved princess looking so\ndead. Their hearts ached for Sumin as they desperately wished that they could\ndo something to stop this wedding. They always dreamt of helping their princess\nget ready for her wedding, but in their minds, the wedding was for her and\nSeokjin. Not her and King Ji Yong. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Princess permit me to speak.&rdquo; The\nnurse asked as she guided Sumin towards her dress.</p><p>Sumin\nhummed in response, allowing the nurse to speak her mind.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It breaks my heart to see you this\nway. I pray to the Holy Father that he will put a stop to this ceremony. You do\nnot deserve to marry such a despicable man.&rdquo; The nurse said; her eyes dripped\nwith concern. </p><p>Sumin&rsquo;s\nlips trembled before she bit her bottom lip. She was doing a great job at not\nbreaking down and sobbing. She was not going to start now. She had to remain\nstrong for everyone dear in her life. </p><p>She\nsmiles softly and places a warm hand on the nurse&rsquo;s cheek.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Everything will be okay&hellip;&rdquo; She said\nsoftly, maintaining her smile. </p><p>The\nnurse sniffled. Tears filled the brims of her eyes. </p><p>Naturally,\nSumin too began to tear up. However, she wiped them away before it could ruin\nher makeup. She then reminded herself that she was doing this for Seokjin&rsquo;s\nsafety. Once this was all over, Seokjin would be safe and back in the kingdom.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He will forgive you, Sumin. He\nwill&hellip;&rdquo; She thought while she felt a few of the maids lace up the corset. </p><p>One of\nthe maids then instructed that she stepped inside her wedding skirt. Sumin\nobediently followed their directions until her body had been completely covered\nby the ceremonial gown.</p><p>Sumin\nslowly turned around and faced the mirror. Her eyes observed her reflection. All\nthis time, she had pictured herself in this dress for her marriage to Seokjin.\nA part of her wished that she had picked out a different dress for her marriage\nto King Ji Yong, but it was too late. </p><p>Time\nwas something that was never on her side. What would make her wedding day any\ndifferent?</p><p>The\nnurse and maids bowed their head in respect, not wanting Sumin to see them\ncrying. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Is the carriage ready? I am ready\nto embark on this journey to wifehood.&rdquo; Sumin muttered, staring at the floor\nsadly. </p><p>The\nnurse nodded and escorted her out of the room.</p><p>Outside\nwas King Ji Yong&rsquo;s knights, ready to escort the princess to the church. King Ji\nYong had ordered them to make sure that Sumin would not try any funny business\nor run, leaving him at the altar. He was only minutes away from having Sumin as\nhis bride. Nothing and no one would stop him now&hellip;</p><p>After\nwhat seemed like forever, Seokjin had finally arrived back to the kingdom. He\npractically hopped off his horse and dashed inside the castle grounds. His eyes\nhurriedly scanned, hoping to find anyone who would know the whereabouts of the\nprincess. He began to lose hope as nobody was seen in the courtyard. </p><p>Luckily,\nhis eye homed in on a familiar face. Princess Sumin&rsquo;s dear and beloved nurse. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Nurse!&rdquo; Seokjin hollered as he ran\nup to her. </p><p>The\nnurse&rsquo;s eyes widened. A look of shocked washed over her face as she slowly\nbecame confused. What was Sumin&rsquo;s knight doing here?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Sir Seokjin?!&rdquo; The nurse shouted\nback as she looked over the knight&rsquo;s body, hoping to find any signs of being\ntortured. &ldquo;You are alive and well? But? How is that possible?&rdquo; She questioned. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\nbrows furrowed, &ldquo;Of course, I am alive. Whatever that horrid King Ji Yong has\nsaid, it is nothing but lies. Now, tell me, where is Sumin? I must show her\nthat I am alive and safe.&rdquo; He demanded, panting. </p><p>The\nnurse stared at him with sympathetic eyes.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I am sorry, Seokjin, but the\nprincess is on her way to the church. She might be even already there.&rdquo; She explained,\nfearing that all hope was lost. </p><p>However,\nSeokjin refused to admit defeat. He was ready to fight King Ji Yong if he had\nto. </p><p>He quickly\nuttered a &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; before rushing back to his horse and riding towards the\nchurch. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Do not marry him, Sumin. Just hold\non&hellip;&rdquo; He anxiously thought.</p><p>With\nthe church in his sight, Seokjin increased the speed of his horse. His heart\nraced with both anxiety and adrenaline as the church steps appeared in front of\nhim. He then pulled on the reins and halted his horse&rsquo;s steps. </p><p>Seokjin\njumped off his horse and ran up the stairs. He pushed open the church doors and\nunfortunately, his heart shattered into a million of pieces. He froze in his\nplace as his eyes widened. His fingers trembled as his breathing became\nsporadic. </p><p>There\nhe stood, watching the love of his life kiss someone else. King Ji Yong had\nwon. He had won <i>his</i> princess&rsquo;s hand\nin marriage. That son of a bitch&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I present you their royal\nmajesties, King Ji Yong and his Queen Sumin.&rdquo; The priest announced; though, he\ntried his best to sound happy. He saw Sumin&rsquo;s body language, and it screamed at\nhim to put a stop to the ceremony. Now, the priest would live with this guilt\nfor the rest of his life. </p><p>Seokjin&rsquo;s\nmind screamed at him to leave the church, but for some reason his feet refused\nto listen to him. </p><p>Suddenly,\nhis eyes caught Sumin&rsquo;s gaze. Due to being far away, Seokjin could not see the\nbrokenness and despair in her eyes. To him, she was filled with joy. To her,\nshe was depressed, defeated, and above all&hellip;she was surprised to see Seokjin\nalive and unharmed. Confusion filled her mind as her eyes switched from her\nknight to her now husband. </p><p>At that\nmoment, she felt like an idiot. She angrily turned towards her <i>husband</i> but before she could demand him\nto tell her the truth, King Ji Yong roughly pulled her closer and whispered a\nbone chilling threat. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If you do anything rash, I will\nhave my men kill your knight where he stands. Now, do you really want bloodshed\non our wedding day?&rdquo; </p><p>Sumin\nfought back her tears, even though a few of them had already cascaded down her\nrosy cheeks. She shook her head, closing her eyes briefly. </p><p>King Ji\nYong smiled and kissed her head sweetly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He said softly with a creepy\ngrin. </p><p>Sumin\nopened her eyes and met Seokjin&rsquo;s gaze one last time. With a sad smile, she\nmouthed, </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; </p><p>Seokjin\nforced a smile and mouthed, &ldquo;I love you too&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He flickered\nhis gaze onto King Ji Yong, who was now smirking proudly, before turning his\nback towards the &ldquo;happy&rdquo; couple. </p><p>He\nopened the doors and walked away, leaving behind the cheers and lively applause&hellip;</p><p><i>And the princess and her knight lived unhappily\never after&hellip;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The End&hellip;</i>\n</p><hr /><p><small><b>A/N:</b>&nbsp;Yeah&hellip; now can you see why I couldn&rsquo;t just leave Seokjin heartbroken like that? I kind of left it open regarding, Seokjin&rsquo;s fate since I didn&rsquo;t want to quite kill him off (especially, if I had a sequel in mind lol then his modern self wouldn&rsquo;t even be alive lol). I always found it fun to leave certain character&rsquo;s unknown fate up to the readers since it gives you an even closer bond to the story! <b>If the sequel wasn&rsquo;t happening, I want you to tell me your thoughts on what happened to Sir Kim Seokjin!&nbsp;</b></small></p><p><small>Anyway, I hope you have enjoyed this beloved story just as much as I did writing it!
