Do they not understand the importance of exercise or do they just not care? I exercise every day. If there is a day where I know I (sadly) won\u2019t have time to fit a sweat session in my schedule, I\u2019ll still find a way to get moving. But that\u2019s me- I know how I benefit from exercise. Do you? </p><p>Let\u2019s jump right into it. Exercise, or really any form of physical activity, instantly improves your overall health. Aside from the long-term health benefits such as improving your risk of developing diseases like type II diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease, it also has immediate perks. After a short 30 minute session, you are lowering blood cholesterol level, building stronger bones, muscles and joints, and fueling your body with more energy. Inturn, you\u2019ll end your day in a better mood, feel more relaxed and sleep better. Ultimately incorporating regular physical activity into your daily schedule will enhance your life immensely. </p><p>In addition to the benefits listed above, the main reason I work out is for a clear and healthy state of mind. I notice during my breaks from the gym that my brain and mind get foggy. There is no other way to describe it other than my head being in the clouds. When I exercise, whether it\u2019s in the morning or at night, I automatically feel an elevation in my mood. I tend to have mood swings often which is such a struggle within itself. Working out doesn\u2019t fix those mood swings altogether, but it really helps me stay calm and aware. </p><p>Creating a healthy state of mind through exercise is attainable. Exercising gives you the distraction you need when it comes to you daily life. You\u2019ll be able to block out those negative thoughts and lift your mood. This happens because exercise reduces your body\u2019s cortisol level while increasing the number of endorphins released in your brain. Cortisol is the natural hormone that is linked to stress, so reducing those levels gives us that relaxing state while endorphins are the natural mood-boosting chemicals that will keep you elevated and happy. Introducing exercise to your weekly schedule will keep your body from building up resistance and keep positivity flowing through your mind and body.</p><p>All in all, exercise isn\u2019t just utilized for physical benefits. By working out on a daily basis, whether that be going for a stroll around the block a couple times a day or lifting heavy weights for an hour, you\u2019re giving your body the ultimate total love and care it needs. Every fiber of your well-being will benefit- your muscles, brain and heart, to be exact. Keep loving yourself and giving your body the attention it deserves. Get that heart rate up and maintain that blood flow\u2026 your body will thank you later. </p>",
