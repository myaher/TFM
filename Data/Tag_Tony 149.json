Tony looked back at Peter and handed him the glove.</p><p>&ldquo;Flash here is our bad guy and you Mr. Parker are Iron-Man.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony moves Peter into a blast stance. He let&rsquo;s go of Peter and tells him to shoot. Peter couldn&rsquo;t find any button until his pointer finger hit something inside the glove.

Peter shoots again and almost hits Happy but luckily he moved out of the way before it got him.</p><p>Now the school was laughing and so was Flash.

He looked back at Tony and nodded his head.</p><p>Tony brought him back over and Peter went into stance. Tony kept his hand over Peter&rsquo;s glove and made it so his front was right up against Peter&rsquo;s back. </p><p>Which didn&rsquo;t help Petey&rsquo;s crush on the older man at all.</p><p>Tony kept whispering nice things to Peter and Peter aimed directly at Flash. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ve noticed you haven&rsquo;t texted or called Happy and I lately an I&rsquo;ve realized how rude I&rsquo;ve been by not even answering anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s chest felt all bubbly and he shot for the last time. The ball hit Flash directly in the chest, sending flash back on to the mattress. </p><p>&ldquo;Ouch.&rdquo;</p><p>Was all Peter could hear from Flash. The gym started cheering and laughing. This time though they weren&rsquo;t laughing at him, hey were cheering for him. </p><p>&ldquo;Good job Kid.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony backs away from him and smiles as Peter looks at Flash laying there in pain. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I do when I see a bad guy.&rdquo; </p><p>Even the teachers were clapping. Happy picked Flash up to make him stand and dragged the mattress away with the pillow.

That made Peter nervous for what was about to happen. Michelle stands in between him and Flash, blocking the way. Ned runs past Flash and leaves everyone.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell Ned!?&rdquo;</p><p>Michelle yelled out. She looked back at Flash and glared at him. Flash glared back but he didn&rsquo;t know what to do next. </p><p>&ldquo;Just walk away. So what if Peter knocked your ass back?&rdquo;</p><p>The students snickered a little until Flash looked at them all. He looked pissed and Pete knew it was time to take the beating before someone else got hurt.</p><p>Peter grabbed Michelle&rsquo;s hand, while still laying on the floor, and looked at her with pleading eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not moving. You don&rsquo;t deserve his shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please. Just let it happen. It&rsquo;s not that bad anyway, just a few bruises.&rdquo;</p><p>By the way Flash looked right now it might not just be bruises.</p><p>Peter stands up by Michelle and moves her to the side. He stands in front of Flash and closes his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so gonna get it Parker.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter squeezed his eyes but nothing happened except the little gasp he hears.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a good idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><a href=\"https://mr-starkerbutgay.tumblr.com/post/182427558801/im-busy-one-flash-was-being-a-real-jerk-today\">1 </a>, <a href=\"https://mr-starkerbutgay.tumblr.com/post/182429504516/im-busy-three\">3</a></p>",

The chair creaked the same every time you stretched backward. You had been staring at the screen for hours. The progress you made on the assignment was slow and your lack of movement made your muscles begging for movement and your eyes searching for moisture. You looked in the bottom corner of the screen to check the time. It read 9:13, which meant that it was time to go \u2018home\u2019. You slid your hand over the power button and held it for 10 seconds, effectively shutting it off. You opened your backpack and put it in, careful not to make anymore rips in the already shredded backpack. Standing up from the chair, you slung it over your shoulder with gentle ease.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you eat anymore?\u201d Mr.Delmar had a quiet concern on his face. A dish towel concealed the glass he was currently wiping down. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your words came out rushed with the surprise of his appearance, \u201cNo, I just pack dinners now.\u201d The lie came out surprisingly smoothly, even with its fast pace. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He raised an eyebrow but waved you goodbye nonetheless. He was used to your unusual behaviors and the long nights but, something about you not eating gave him an uneasiness worth noting. You flipped his open sign off before walking out the door, an agreement between you two in the past couple of weeks.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The streets were still alive with people but would soon dwindle as hookers, drug dealers, and criminals took their place. The walk home was consumed with memories, your mind wandering with each passing building.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After running here, your mind was still numb from the horror you\u2019d run from. But Mama always filled it with emotion. She made you remember that there was joy and time to let your feelings consume you.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So every Thursday she took you to the park. She let you run the trails and climb the trees. She catch you when you\u2019d miss the branch and every time you\u2019d say, \u201cHi, mama.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And every time she\u2019d set you down and you\u2019d run to the spot. The spot where she would remind you that it\u2019s ok to grieve. So you\u2019d pick whatever weed resembled a flower and set it on the willow tree. Your other flowers accumulating in various forms of decay. That willow stood alone in the park, lonely of its kind. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOlivia, get back in here! It\u2019s bedtime,\u201d a little girl around nine years old ran by, a red ball in her hand and dirt on her boots. You moved to the side as she barrelled by, her feet slamming on the pavement and through the door to her house.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oliver ran from under the willow, screaming as Pietro swung from a branch, also screaming. You and Wanda stood 10 yards away, watching their madness unfold. Wanda held a red ball under her arm, long forgotten after the tree became involved in your game. Wanda nudged you with her free arm and gestured towards Pietro, who was still unaware of the two girls next to him. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 She tossed the ball in the air and caught it.

As he fell, she raised her arm for a high five for the best throw she\u2019d ever made. Receiving one back, you and Wanda ran from a very angry Pietro brandishing a willow branch. Oliver lagged behind trudging along in the grass after all three of you. Laughter rang through the night, your mother&rsquo;s voice cutting through the sound with its own. It\u2019s bedtime.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A mother walked home from a drug store, she carried her groceries all in two hands and a diaper bag on her back.

The chair creaked the same every time you stretched backward. You had been staring at the screen for hours. The progress you made on the assignment was slow and your lack of movement made your muscles begging for movement and your eyes searching for moisture.

But Mama always filled it with emotion. She made you remember that there was joy and time to let your feelings consume you.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So every Thursday she took you to the park. She let you run the trails and climb the trees. She catch you when you\u2019d miss the branch and every time you\u2019d say, \u201cHi, mama.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And every time she\u2019d set you down and you\u2019d run to the spot. The spot where she would remind you that it\u2019s ok to grieve. So you\u2019d pick whatever weed resembled a flower and set it on the willow tree. Your other flowers accumulating in various forms of decay. That willow stood alone in the park, lonely of its kind. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOlivia, get back in here! It\u2019s bedtime,\u201d a little girl around nine years old ran by, a red ball in her hand and dirt on her boots.

The chair creaked the same every time you stretched backward. You had been staring at the screen for hours. The progress you made on the assignment was slow and your lack of movement made your muscles begging for movement and your eyes searching for moisture. You looked in the bottom corner of the screen to check the time. It read 9:13, which meant that it was time to go &lsquo;home&rsquo;. You slid your hand over the power button and held it for 10 seconds, effectively shutting it off. You opened your backpack and put it in, careful not to make anymore rips in the already shredded backpack. Standing up from the chair, you slung it over your shoulder with gentle ease.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you eat anymore?&rdquo; Mr.Delmar had a quiet concern on his face. A dish towel concealed the glass he was currently wiping down. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your words came out rushed with the surprise of his appearance, &ldquo;No, I just pack dinners now.&rdquo; The lie came out surprisingly smoothly, even with its fast pace. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He raised an eyebrow but waved you goodbye nonetheless. He was used to your unusual behaviors and the long nights but, something about you not eating gave him an uneasiness worth noting. You flipped his open sign off before walking out the door, an agreement between you two in the past couple of weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The streets were still alive with people but would soon dwindle as hookers, drug dealers, and criminals took their place. The walk home was consumed with memories, your mind wandering with each passing building.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After running here, your mind was still numb from the horror you&rsquo;d run from. But Mama always filled it with emotion. She made you remember that there was joy and time to let your feelings consume you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So every Thursday she took you to the park. She let you run the trails and climb the trees. She catch you when you&rsquo;d miss the branch and every time you&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Hi, mama.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every time she&rsquo;d set you down and you&rsquo;d run to the spot. The spot where she would remind you that it&rsquo;s ok to grieve. So you&rsquo;d pick whatever weed resembled a flower and set it on the willow tree. Your other flowers accumulating in various forms of decay. That willow stood alone in the park, lonely of its kind. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Olivia, get back in here! It&rsquo;s bedtime,&rdquo; a little girl around nine years old ran by, a red ball in her hand and dirt on her boots. You moved to the side as she barrelled by, her feet slamming on the pavement and through the door to her house.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver ran from under the willow, screaming as Pietro swung from a branch, also screaming. You and Wanda stood 10 yards away, watching their madness unfold. Wanda held a red ball under her arm, long forgotten after the tree became involved in your game. Wanda nudged you with her free arm and gestured towards Pietro, who was still unaware of the two girls next to him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tossed the ball in the air and caught it. She drew her elbow back and followed through, just like her dad taught her. The red ball, now a weapon, hit Pietro directly in the head, knocking him from the branch. As he fell, she raised her arm for a high five for the best throw she&rsquo;d ever made. Receiving one back, you and Wanda ran from a very angry Pietro brandishing a willow branch. Oliver lagged behind trudging along in the grass after all three of you. Laughter rang through the night, your mother&rsquo;s voice cutting through the sound with its own. It&rsquo;s bedtime.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother walked home from a drug store, she carried her groceries all in two hands and a diaper bag on her back. You noticed the lemon branches decorating its fabric and the smell of baby wipes and Febreze hit you full force as she passed by you.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kitchen table was scattered with your language homework. The teachers at your school tried effortlessly to teach you English. It&rsquo;s foreign and sharp sound never sticking in your brain. Oliver sat in his highchair in only a cloth diaper and a grin on his face. You dropped the pencil from your hand and whined, a trademark noise when the homework came out. You pushed the seat back and walked over to the pantry. Fresh fruit lined its shelves. Going for an apple you noticed another, not for you but for your demon of a brother.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; you called for your mom. She walked in with question written on her face. You held up a lemon and pointed at Oliver with a grin on your face. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Honey!&rdquo; She called to your father, who currently was sat on the porch with last week&rsquo;s crossword puzzle. You could hear the creak of the porch swing as he made his way to the kitchen. He looked over to his wife who nodded towards you. The lemon in your hand signaled for a first from your little brother in the high chair, currently giggling at a small beetle on his tray.</p><p>With the lemon cut up, you gave it Oliver who happily raised it to his mouth, unaware of the camera about to be snapped and the laughter about to ensue.</p><p>The street had begun to clear of law-abiding citizens and begun to populate with criminals and addicts of every kind.
