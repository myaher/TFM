Do you need something?\u201d</p><p>Yeza smiles at the familiar deflection- putting her own emotional worries aside to worry about someone else. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, sweetheart. I conked out rather early.\u201d</p><p>He pulls himself up next to her on the windowsill.

He can hear the love in her voice as she describes them to him. </p><p>\u201cOh they\u2019re, they\u2019re something alright. A bunch of weirdos, but- but they\u2019re my weirdos now. There\u2019s Caleb, of course, I met him long before I met the others, right after the- ah, the goblins, in prison. We broke out of prison together, actually! His cat brought me a wire and I picked the lock and we set it on fire! </p><p>He\u2019s, he\u2019s very smart, as smart as you, certainly, and he knows so much magic! He\u2019s been teaching me, you know, all sorts of little spells, like mage hand and such,\u201d at this, she says some odd words and moves her hands in a funny sort of way and <i>disappears</i>! </p><p>Yeza yelps a little in surprise, but when he reaches forward, he can feel the rough-spun cloth of her cloak. \u201cWhoa!\u201d he exclaims, eyes wide with wonder. \u201cHoney, this is- this is <i>amazing! </i>I\u2019ve never even- you can turn <i>invisible!</i>\u201d</p><p>She reappears, her cheeks a darker green than the surrounding skin in what he supposes is a blush. He takes one of her hands in his. He can see she\u2019s uncomfortable with the praise, and supposes he\u2019s got plenty of time to tell her how much he loves her later. </p><p>\u201cSo, about your other companions?\u201d he says.</p><p>Again, her face lights up, and Yeza thinks maybe he\u2019ll have to thank these people, these colorful strangers, because they\u2019ve made his wife happy when he couldn\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s also Jester, we\u2019re best friends, and detectives together, although we\u2019re discussing possibly letting Beau join, that\u2019s still in the air- anyway, she\u2019s a healer, but she likes hitting things much more than healing, and she\u2019s very good at it too! The hitting thing, I mean, but she\u2019s also very heal-ey! <br/></p><p>Beau, she\u2019s the monk with a scary looking face, and she <i>is </i>very scary, but she\u2019s also kind of nice? and yells at strangers who are rude to the group, and she\u2019s getting better at talking to people- or at least that\u2019s what she and Fjord say, I haven\u2019t actually seen it happen yet, but I suppose I\u2019ll trust them. And then there\u2019s Fjord\u2026\u201d</p><p>They stay huddled in the window until sunrise, Yeza listening to Veth\u2019s commentary on her companions. There were a fair amount of jokes he didn\u2019t understand- something about the gnolls, and- the number nine? But, he has time to learn, now.
