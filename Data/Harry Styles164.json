Stop worrying about me,\u201d you insist, wrapping your arms around his shoulders, your fingertips laced together at the nape of his neck, playing with the curled baby hairs that fall out his bun. \u201cSing your heart out, and I\u2019ll be <i>grand</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames is going to ask about \u2018Perfect\u2019, most likely, and \u2018m not sure what else,\u201d he sighs, his eyes fluttering closed as you kiss his forehead, \u201cbut, y\u2019a know if you get uncomfortable with anything, you can leave and not stay out there \u2013 I won\u2019t be bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not leaving an interview because James is going to talk about a lyric that you wrote, b\u2019fore I met you,\u201d you assure, shaking your head as he purses his lips. \u201c\u2019m more mature than that.\u201d</p><p>He kisses your lips gently, squeezing your hips as you wrap your arms tighter around him, his hands holding you close to his chest as he hugs you. \u201cCan you at least promise me that if <i>anything</i>, you won\u2019t leave? Gem is here and wants to see you, and I think Mum is going to meet us for dinner in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth would I go, hm? Do I look like I know my way around London?\u201d you scoff, wrapping your arms around him in a tight squeeze, stepping away and allows him to stand on his feet.</p><p>He straightens his jeans and patterned shirt before slinging his arm around your shoulders, your arms tucked around his waist, fingers nudged beneath his shirt and holding onto his hips as you begin to walk into the corridor, laughter and talking echoing off the walls from the kitchen, Niall\u2019s cackle heard above everyone else.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t possibly be any louder, <i>I swear</i>,\u201d Harry teases, manoeuvring his hold to intertwine your fingers, his palm warm against yours, his figure pushing the door open into the crowded room, his best friends gathered around the large dining tables with their girlfriends and meals scattered across the table cloth. \u201cWe could hear all the way in the dressing room, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not \u2018me fault,\u201d he defends, his hand covering his mouth as he chokes on his water, \u201cOur friends are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve told you that one long ago,\u201d Harry chuckles, shaking his head as he gestures toward an empty seat on the bench, stepping away to gather water bottles and a lunch for you and himself.</p><p>\u201cHow was your flight, Y/N? Did jet lag kick in, yet?\u201d Louis wonders, his water being gulped as he finishes his final word.</p><p>\u201cWould you call falling asleep at half nine last night and waking up at nine this morning jet lag?\u201d you laugh, yawning as you nod a \u2018thank you\u2019 to your boyfriend as he settles in his seat beside you. \u201cBecause, if you do, then <i>hell yes</i> jet lag has kicked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping at <i>half nine</i>,\u201d Liam emphasises, his eyes widening and eyebrows raising as he reiterates your sentence. \u201cHas to be a new jet lag record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep on the plane! Grump, she was, when we had to wake her up once we landed,\u201d Harry teases, kissing your cheek as you roll your eyes, his hand squeezing your thigh lovingly as you squint at him. \u201cY/N is getting used to the travelling, though. She\u2019s only travelled home with me, twice, right? We went to an old friend from Chapel\u2019s wedding in April and you met my family for the first time, and <i>now</i>, you\u2019re here, <i>we\u2019re</i> here, until January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your family about the engagement, yet?\u201d Sophia smiles, her torso moving forward to face you, her hand reaching out to admire your ring, a perfect fit with a diamond settled comfortably on your finger. \u201cHarry, your mum is going to be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t told anyone yet. We told Y/N\u2019s family on Christmas Eve, and we\u2019re telling my family on New Year\u2019s. Hopefully Gem doesn\u2019t find out before then, because she\u2019ll spoil everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma? <i>No</i>. She wouldn\u2019t say anything,\u201d you assure, pouting your bottom lip as you think carefully about his sister\u2019s reaction to your announcement. \u201cDon\u2019t think she would, anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be <i>too</i> excited to not tell our mother. \u2018m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to hide my ring, then, when \u2018m seated with her during the performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he shrugs, his lips curving into a smirk as he kisses your hair.</p><p>He would have to admit, he loved having your engagement as a secret. He loved having a moment with you that he didn\u2019t have to share with everyone, <i>just yet</i>. He, <i>obviously</i>, wants to tell his mother \u2013 she will be ecstatic \u2013 but he wanted to have your moment to absorb your engagement privately, before everyone would be wondering about every detail of your wedding day.</p><p>He only wanted your engagement to be yours \u2013 and you didn\u2019t mind that, either.</p><p><i>+ +</i></p><p>Gemma embraces you tightly as you step onto the platform where you would be sitting. With a perfect view of the stage and your fianc\u00e9 able to spot you in the crowd, you couldn\u2019t have hoped for a better experience. She has a bright smile on her face, her date standing nervously to greet you, a smirk building on your features as you wink, her cheeks blushing pink as you laugh quietly. She is one of your favourite people that you have ever met \u2013 truly one of the most kind, caring, loving individuals that has been introduced into your life, and knowing that she would be your sister in only a short four months made you <i>very</i> excited.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello! Oh, I\u2019ve missed you. \u2018m thinking I\u2019ll have to sneak you away from my brother for a day date before your off on your way home \u2013 we have <i>so much</i> to talk about,\u201d she grins, hugging you with a squeeze, her hands holding yours as she smiles. \u201cOh! Y/N, this is Michal, Michal, this is Y/N. She and Harry have been dating for nearly a year, now. We\u2019re all waiting for him to propose, y\u2019a know. \u2018m sure my mum will be nagging him about marrying you as soon as you step inside; she\u2019s been waiting since Day One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you, Michal. Oh, and have I mentioned how much I <i>love</i> your mother,\u201d you giggle, your heart pounding wildly as your ring nudges against your palm \u2013 you forgot to take it off. \u201cWe\u2019re driving into Chapel on New Year\u2019s Eve. We can have lunch any day. Harry will have to deal with a date, he can preoccupy himself for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a baby,\u201d she mocks, shaking her head as you settle in your seat, herself and Michal sitting comfortably, her words quieting as the stage lights begin to dim and James steps on stage. \u201cHe\u2019ll complain, but \u2018m still doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will definitely go out,\u201d you assure, smiling widely as your ears perk to Harry\u2019s name. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>Harry steps onto the stage confidently, his best friends set in their designated spots, with the microphones securely in place and ready to be used. Harry sees you instantly, his green eyes lighting up with your presence, his cheeks blushing pink as you blow him a kiss encouragingly.</p><p>He sings his heart out. His passion and love for his career shining, his melodic voice bringing tears to your eyes \u2013 you couldn\u2019t have been more proud of him. He could be humming in the shower, or as he mindless prepares dinner in your kitchen; you were <i>so</i> proud.</p><p>His figure fidgets nervously on the couch once their interview with James begins, his anxiousness unseen to the audience and his best friends, but you could <i>see</i> his nerves in his eyes. He was worried about the questions, about the comments, about the possibilities of what could be upsetting to you \u2013 because the <i>last</i> thing he would want if for you to be hurt by words that were said carelessly.</p><p>James smirks as he begins his next segment of the interview, and Harry knows <i>exactly</i> where he\u2019s going with it. His cheeks blush nervously as he blinks \u2013 <i>of course</i>, James would have to touch on his lyrics; why would he not?</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m reading the lyrics and I happen upon a line, and in this line it says, \u2018\u2026 <i>and if you\u2019re looking to find someone to write your break up songs about, baby, I\u2019m perfect.\u2019</i> Now listen, I don\u2019t wan\u2019a have any \u2018Bad Blood\u2019 about this, and if this is a problem, we don\u2019t have to talk about it and we can just \u2018Shake It Off\u2019.\u201d James pauses, Niall\u2019s laughter echoing around the room, Harry\u2019s fingertips pinching his features as he blushes a shade of pink and smirks. \u201cWho\u2019s the song about?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs, shaking his head as he begins his smooth response, \u201cUm, I think the thing with song writing is that, everybody writes from personal experience, y\u2019a know? It\u2019s not always necessarily what it sounds like it\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d James chimes, the audience\u2019s laughter making you smile.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, sometimes it is! I think it\u2019s up for, uh, it\u2019s open to interpretation of what anyone thinks it\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwiftly dealt with,\u201d James retorts, Harry\u2019s smirk making your cheeks ache with a smile.</p><p>His final performance, his final song of the day is wonderful. With the audience singing and dancing along, you could <i>see</i> how happy his career made him, how much he loved being on stage and singing to hundreds and thousands of people \u2013 of individuals and an undeniable, loving fanbase who love and adore him as much as he would love and adore each and every one of them.</p><p>Words couldn\u2019t possibly describe how proud you were of him, how much you loved him.</p><p>Gemma smiles as you talk about your lunch date that would be occurring the following afternoon, your excitement exhibited on your features as you think of dining and boutiques that would be taking your money as you have a walk through downtown \u2013 a favourite destination you couldn\u2019t visit often but loved so much. Becoming a part of Harry\u2019s family meant becoming friendly with the people that meant the most to him \u2013 and you were incredibly grateful and felt so loved by everyone, especially Gemma; she had become one of your best friends in the quaint amount of time you had known her, truly gotten to know her, and hiding that you were engaged and getting married to her baby brother in less than six months was eating away at your stomach.</p><p>New Year\u2019s Eve felt like a light-year away.</p><p>Harry bumbles into the dressing room, a smile perked on his lips as he wraps his arms around your waist, lifting you lightly off your feet, kissing your lips as you cup his palms in your hands. His eyebrows furrow together in confusion as he hears a gasp at the entrance of the room, his eyes widening as he notices his older sister\u2019s narrowed vision on your finger, your engagement ring glimmering beneath the fluorescent lights.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I <i>knew</i> it!\u201d she grins, stepping inside and reaching for your hand, her fingertip tracing of the diamond delicately. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m mad at you for not telling me, but I am too excited to show that, right now.\u201d She embraces you tightly, rocking you in her hold as she laughs, her attention travelling between you and the engagement ring permanently marked on your finger. \u201cVery nice choice, by the way, H. Have you told Mum, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t told many people. We\u2019re waiting until New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d he informs, his attention focused solely on her as he wraps his arm around your shoulder, your arms tucked around his waist and you nuzzle into his side. \u201cGemma, if you tell Mum before we do, I am going to be <i>so</i> upset with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t!\u201d she squeaks, her lips etched into a grin with excitement. \u201c\u2019m expecting every detail of the proposal when you tell our mother. Oh God, she is going to be over the moon. She has been waiting for this for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re <i>very</i> excited to tell her,\u201d you smile, your eyelashes fluttering against your cheeks as Harry kisses your hair. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting New Year\u2019s \u2013 an exciting year \u2013 we could at least tell y\u2019a that.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re all waiting for him to propose, y\u2019a know. \u2018m sure my mum will be nagging him about marrying you as soon as you step inside; she\u2019s been waiting since Day One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice to meet you, Michal. Oh, and have I mentioned how much I <i>love</i> your mother,\u201d you giggle, your heart pounding wildly as your ring nudges against your palm \u2013 you forgot to take it off. \u201cWe\u2019re driving into Chapel on New Year\u2019s Eve. We can have lunch any day. Harry will have to deal with a date, he can preoccupy himself for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a baby,\u201d she mocks, shaking her head as you settle in your seat, herself and Michal sitting comfortably, her words quieting as the stage lights begin to dim and James steps on stage. \u201cHe\u2019ll complain, but \u2018m still doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will definitely go out,\u201d you assure, smiling widely as your ears perk to Harry\u2019s name. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>Harry steps onto the stage confidently, his best friends set in their designated spots, with the microphones securely in place and ready to be used. Harry sees you instantly, his green eyes lighting up with your presence, his cheeks blushing pink as you blow him a kiss encouragingly.</p><p>He sings his heart out. His passion and love for his career shining, his melodic voice bringing tears to your eyes \u2013 you couldn\u2019t have been more proud of him. He could be humming in the shower, or as he mindless prepares dinner in your kitchen; you were <i>so</i> proud.</p><p>His figure fidgets nervously on the couch once their interview with James begins, his anxiousness unseen to the audience and his best friends, but you could <i>see</i> his nerves in his eyes. He was worried about the questions, about the comments, about the possibilities of what could be upsetting to you \u2013 because the <i>last</i> thing he would want if for you to be hurt by words that were said carelessly.</p><p>James smirks as he begins his next segment of the interview, and Harry knows <i>exactly</i> where he\u2019s going with it. His cheeks blush nervously as he blinks \u2013 <i>of course</i>, James would have to touch on his lyrics; why would he not?</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m reading the lyrics and I happen upon a line, and in this line it says, \u2018\u2026 <i>and if you\u2019re looking to find someone to write your break up songs about, baby, I\u2019m perfect.\u2019</i> Now listen, I don\u2019t wan\u2019a have any \u2018Bad Blood\u2019 about this, and if this is a problem, we don\u2019t have to talk about it and we can just \u2018Shake It Off\u2019.\u201d James pauses, Niall\u2019s laughter echoing around the room, Harry\u2019s fingertips pinching his features as he blushes a shade of pink and smirks. \u201cWho\u2019s the song about?\u201d</p><p>Harry laughs, shaking his head as he begins his smooth response, \u201cUm, I think the thing with song writing is that, everybody writes from personal experience, y\u2019a know? It\u2019s not always necessarily what it sounds like it\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d James chimes, the audience\u2019s laughter making you smile.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, sometimes it is! I think it\u2019s up for, uh, it\u2019s open to interpretation of what anyone thinks it\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwiftly dealt with,\u201d James retorts, Harry\u2019s smirk making your cheeks ache with a smile.</p><p>His final performance, his final song of the day is wonderful. With the audience singing and dancing along, you could <i>see</i> how happy his career made him, how much he loved being on stage and singing to hundreds and thousands of people \u2013 of individuals and an undeniable, loving fanbase who love and adore him as much as he would love and adore each and every one of them.</p><p>Words couldn\u2019t possibly describe how proud you were of him, how much you loved him.</p><p>Gemma smiles as you talk about your lunch date that would be occurring the following afternoon, your excitement exhibited on your features as you think of dining and boutiques that would be taking your money as you have a walk through downtown \u2013 a favourite destination you couldn\u2019t visit often but loved so much. Becoming a part of Harry\u2019s family meant becoming friendly with the people that meant the most to him \u2013 and you were incredibly grateful and felt so loved by everyone, especially Gemma; she had become one of your best friends in the quaint amount of time you had known her, truly gotten to know her, and hiding that you were engaged and getting married to her baby brother in less than six months was eating away at your stomach.</p><p>New Year\u2019s Eve felt like a light-year away.</p><p>Harry bumbles into the dressing room, a smile perked on his lips as he wraps his arms around your waist, lifting you lightly off your feet, kissing your lips as you cup his palms in your hands. His eyebrows furrow together in confusion as he hears a gasp at the entrance of the room, his eyes widening as he notices his older sister\u2019s narrowed vision on your finger, your engagement ring glimmering beneath the fluorescent lights.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I <i>knew</i> it!\u201d she grins, stepping inside and reaching for your hand, her fingertip tracing of the diamond delicately. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m mad at you for not telling me, but I am too excited to show that, right now.\u201d She embraces you tightly, rocking you in her hold as she laughs, her attention travelling between you and the engagement ring permanently marked on your finger. \u201cVery nice choice, by the way, H. Have you told Mum, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t told many people. We\u2019re waiting until New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d he informs, his attention focused solely on her as he wraps his arm around your shoulder, your arms tucked around his waist and you nuzzle into his side. \u201cGemma, if you tell Mum before we do, I am going to be <i>so</i> upset with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t!\u201d she squeaks, her lips etched into a grin with excitement. \u201c\u2019m expecting every detail of the proposal when you tell our mother. Oh God, she is going to be over the moon. She has been waiting for this for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re <i>very</i> excited to tell her,\u201d you smile, your eyelashes fluttering against your cheeks as Harry kisses your hair. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting New Year\u2019s \u2013 an exciting year \u2013 we could at least tell y\u2019a that.\u201d</p></p>",

Stop worrying about me,\u201d you insist, wrapping your arms around his shoulders, your fingertips laced together at the nape of his neck, playing with the curled baby hairs that fall out his bun. \u201cSing your heart out, and I\u2019ll be <i>grand</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames is going to ask about \u2018Perfect\u2019, most likely, and \u2018m not sure what else,\u201d he sighs, his eyes fluttering closed as you kiss his forehead, \u201cbut, y\u2019a know if you get uncomfortable with anything, you can leave and not stay out there \u2013 I won\u2019t be bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not leaving an interview because James is going to talk about a lyric that you wrote, b\u2019fore I met you,\u201d you assure, shaking your head as he purses his lips. \u201c\u2019m more mature than that.\u201d</p><p>He kisses your lips gently, squeezing your hips as you wrap your arms tighter around him, his hands holding you close to his chest as he hugs you. \u201cCan you at least promise me that if <i>anything</i>, you won\u2019t leave? Gem is here and wants to see you, and I think Mum is going to meet us for dinner in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth would I go, hm? Do I look like I know my way around London?\u201d you scoff, wrapping your arms around him in a tight squeeze, stepping away and allows him to stand on his feet.</p><p>He straightens his jeans and patterned shirt before slinging his arm around your shoulders, your arms tucked around his waist, fingers nudged beneath his shirt and holding onto his hips as you begin to walk into the corridor, laughter and talking echoing off the walls from the kitchen, Niall\u2019s cackle heard above everyone else.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t possibly be any louder, <i>I swear</i>,\u201d Harry teases, manoeuvring his hold to intertwine your fingers, his palm warm against yours, his figure pushing the door open into the crowded room, his best friends gathered around the large dining tables with their girlfriends and meals scattered across the table cloth. \u201cWe could hear all the way in the dressing room, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s not \u2018me fault,\u201d he defends, his hand covering his mouth as he chokes on his water, \u201cOur friends are idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve told you that one long ago,\u201d Harry chuckles, shaking his head as he gestures toward an empty seat on the bench, stepping away to gather water bottles and a lunch for you and himself.</p><p>\u201cHow was your flight, Y/N? Did jet lag kick in, yet?\u201d Louis wonders, his water being gulped as he finishes his final word.</p><p>\u201cWould you call falling asleep at half nine last night and waking up at nine this morning jet lag?\u201d you laugh, yawning as you nod a \u2018thank you\u2019 to your boyfriend as he settles in his seat beside you. \u201cBecause, if you do, then <i>hell yes</i> jet lag has kicked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping at <i>half nine</i>,\u201d Liam emphasises, his eyes widening and eyebrows raising as he reiterates your sentence. \u201cHas to be a new jet lag record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell asleep on the plane! Grump, she was, when we had to wake her up once we landed,\u201d Harry teases, kissing your cheek as you roll your eyes, his hand squeezing your thigh lovingly as you squint at him. \u201cY/N is getting used to the travelling, though. She\u2019s only travelled home with me, twice, right? We went to an old friend from Chapel\u2019s wedding in April and you met my family for the first time, and <i>now</i>, you\u2019re here, <i>we\u2019re</i> here, until January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your family about the engagement, yet?\u201d Sophia smiles, her torso moving forward to face you, her hand reaching out to admire your ring, a perfect fit with a diamond settled comfortably on your finger. \u201cHarry, your mum is going to be so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t told anyone yet. We told Y/N\u2019s family on Christmas Eve, and we\u2019re telling my family on New Year\u2019s. Hopefully Gem doesn\u2019t find out before then, because she\u2019ll spoil everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma? <i>No</i>. She wouldn\u2019t say anything,\u201d you assure, pouting your bottom lip as you think carefully about his sister\u2019s reaction to your announcement. \u201cDon\u2019t think she would, anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be <i>too</i> excited to not tell our mother. \u2018m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to hide my ring, then, when \u2018m seated with her during the performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he shrugs, his lips curving into a smirk as he kisses your hair.</p><p>He would have to admit, he loved having your engagement as a secret. He loved having a moment with you that he didn\u2019t have to share with everyone, <i>just yet</i>. He, <i>obviously</i>, wants to tell his mother \u2013 she will be ecstatic \u2013 but he wanted to have your moment to absorb your engagement privately, before everyone would be wondering about every detail of your wedding day.</p><p>He only wanted your engagement to be yours \u2013 and you didn\u2019t mind that, either.</p><p><i>+ +</i></p><p>Gemma embraces you tightly as you step onto the platform where you would be sitting. With a perfect view of the stage and your fianc\u00e9 able to spot you in the crowd, you couldn\u2019t have hoped for a better experience. She has a bright smile on her face, her date standing nervously to greet you, a smirk building on your features as you wink, her cheeks blushing pink as you laugh quietly. She is one of your favourite people that you have ever met \u2013 truly one of the most kind, caring, loving individuals that has been introduced into your life, and knowing that she would be your sister in only a short four months made you <i>very</i> excited.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello! Oh, I\u2019ve missed you. \u2018m thinking I\u2019ll have to sneak you away from my brother for a day date before your off on your way home \u2013 we have <i>so much</i> to talk about,\u201d she grins, hugging you with a squeeze, her hands holding yours as she smiles. \u201cOh! Y/N, this is Michal, Michal, this is Y/N. She and Harry have been dating for nearly a year, now.

Stop worrying about me,&rdquo; you insist, wrapping your arms around his shoulders, your fingertips laced together at the nape of his neck, playing with the curled baby hairs that fall out his bun. &ldquo;Sing your heart out, and I&rsquo;ll be <i>grand</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;James is going to ask about &lsquo;Perfect&rsquo;, most likely, and &lsquo;m not sure what else,&rdquo; he sighs, his eyes fluttering closed as you kiss his forehead, &ldquo;but, y&rsquo;a know if you get uncomfortable with anything, you can leave and not stay out there &ndash; I won&rsquo;t be bothered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I&rsquo;m not leaving an interview because James is going to talk about a lyric that you wrote, b&rsquo;fore I met you,&rdquo; you assure, shaking your head as he purses his lips. &ldquo;&rsquo;m more mature than that.&rdquo;</p><p>He kisses your lips gently, squeezing your hips as you wrap your arms tighter around him, his hands holding you close to his chest as he hugs you. &ldquo;Can you at least promise me that if <i>anything</i>, you won&rsquo;t leave? Gem is here and wants to see you, and I think Mum is going to meet us for dinner in the city.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where on earth would I go, hm? Do I look like I know my way around London?&rdquo; you scoff, wrapping your arms around him in a tight squeeze, stepping away and allows him to stand on his feet.</p><p>He straightens his jeans and patterned shirt before slinging his arm around your shoulders, your arms tucked around his waist, fingers nudged beneath his shirt and holding onto his hips as you begin to walk into the corridor, laughter and talking echoing off the walls from the kitchen, Niall&rsquo;s cackle heard above everyone else.</p><p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t possibly be any louder, <i>I swear</i>,&rdquo; Harry teases, manoeuvring his hold to intertwine your fingers, his palm warm against yours, his figure pushing the door open into the crowded room, his best friends gathered around the large dining tables with their girlfriends and meals scattered across the table cloth. &ldquo;We could hear all the way in the dressing room, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;s not &lsquo;me fault,&rdquo; he defends, his hand covering his mouth as he chokes on his water, &ldquo;Our friends are idiots.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could&rsquo;ve told you that one long ago,&rdquo; Harry chuckles, shaking his head as he gestures toward an empty seat on the bench, stepping away to gather water bottles and a lunch for you and himself.</p><p>&ldquo;How was your flight, Y/N? Did jet lag kick in, yet?&rdquo; Louis wonders, his water being gulped as he finishes his final word.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you call falling asleep at half nine last night and waking up at nine this morning jet lag?&rdquo; you laugh, yawning as you nod a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to your boyfriend as he settles in his seat beside you. &ldquo;Because, if you do, then <i>hell yes</i> jet lag has kicked in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sleeping at <i>half nine</i>,&rdquo; Liam emphasises, his eyes widening and eyebrows raising as he reiterates your sentence. &ldquo;Has to be a new jet lag record.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She fell asleep on the plane! Grump, she was, when we had to wake her up once we landed,&rdquo; Harry teases, kissing your cheek as you roll your eyes, his hand squeezing your thigh lovingly as you squint at him. &ldquo;Y/N is getting used to the travelling, though. She&rsquo;s only travelled home with me, twice, right? We went to an old friend from Chapel&rsquo;s wedding in April and you met my family for the first time, and <i>now</i>, you&rsquo;re here, <i>we&rsquo;re</i> here, until January.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you tell your family about the engagement, yet?&rdquo; Sophia smiles, her torso moving forward to face you, her hand reaching out to admire your ring, a perfect fit with a diamond settled comfortably on your finger. &ldquo;Harry, your mum is going to be so happy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t told anyone yet. We told Y/N&rsquo;s family on Christmas Eve, and we&rsquo;re telling my family on New Year&rsquo;s. Hopefully Gem doesn&rsquo;t find out before then, because she&rsquo;ll spoil everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gemma? <i>No</i>. She wouldn&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; you assure, pouting your bottom lip as you think carefully about his sister&rsquo;s reaction to your announcement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think she would, anyways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will be <i>too</i> excited to not tell our mother. &lsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have to hide my ring, then, when &lsquo;m seated with her during the performance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; he shrugs, his lips curving into a smirk as he kisses your hair.</p><p>He would have to admit, he loved having your engagement as a secret. He loved having a moment with you that he didn&rsquo;t have to share with everyone, <i>just yet</i>. He, <i>obviously</i>, wants to tell his mother &ndash; she will be ecstatic &ndash; but he wanted to have your moment to absorb your engagement privately, before everyone would be wondering about every detail of your wedding day.</p><p>He only wanted your engagement to be yours &ndash; and you didn&rsquo;t mind that, either.</p><p><i>+ +</i></p><p>Gemma embraces you tightly as you step onto the platform where you would be sitting. With a perfect view of the stage and your fianc&eacute; able to spot you in the crowd, you couldn&rsquo;t have hoped for a better experience. She has a bright smile on her face, her date standing nervously to greet you, a smirk building on your features as you wink, her cheeks blushing pink as you laugh quietly. She is one of your favourite people that you have ever met &ndash; truly one of the most kind, caring, loving individuals that has been introduced into your life, and knowing that she would be your sister in only a short four months made you <i>very</i> excited.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, hello! Oh, I&rsquo;ve missed you. &lsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll have to sneak you away from my brother for a day date before your off on your way home &ndash; we have <i>so much</i> to talk about,&rdquo; she grins, hugging you with a squeeze, her hands holding yours as she smiles. &ldquo;Oh! Y/N, this is Michal, Michal, this is Y/N. She and Harry have been dating for nearly a year, now. We&rsquo;re all waiting for him to propose, y&rsquo;a know. &lsquo;m sure my mum will be nagging him about marrying you as soon as you step inside; she&rsquo;s been waiting since Day One.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very nice to meet you, Michal. Oh, and have I mentioned how much I <i>love</i> your mother,&rdquo; you giggle, your heart pounding wildly as your ring nudges against your palm &ndash; you forgot to take it off. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re driving into Chapel on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. We can have lunch any day. Harry will have to deal with a date, he can preoccupy himself for the day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a baby,&rdquo; she mocks, shaking her head as you settle in your seat, herself and Michal sitting comfortably, her words quieting as the stage lights begin to dim and James steps on stage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll complain, but &lsquo;m still doing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will definitely go out,&rdquo; you assure, smiling widely as your ears perk to Harry&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry steps onto the stage confidently, his best friends set in their designated spots, with the microphones securely in place and ready to be used. Harry sees you instantly, his green eyes lighting up with your presence, his cheeks blushing pink as you blow him a kiss encouragingly.</p><p>He sings his heart out. His passion and love for his career shining, his melodic voice bringing tears to your eyes &ndash; you couldn&rsquo;t have been more proud of him. He could be humming in the shower, or as he mindless prepares dinner in your kitchen; you were <i>so</i> proud.</p><p>His figure fidgets nervously on the couch once their interview with James begins, his anxiousness unseen to the audience and his best friends, but you could <i>see</i> his nerves in his eyes. He was worried about the questions, about the comments, about the possibilities of what could be upsetting to you &ndash; because the <i>last</i> thing he would want if for you to be hurt by words that were said carelessly.</p><p>James smirks as he begins his next segment of the interview, and Harry knows <i>exactly</i> where he&rsquo;s going with it. His cheeks blush nervously as he blinks &ndash; <i>of course</i>, James would have to touch on his lyrics; why would he not?</p><p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m reading the lyrics and I happen upon a line, and in this line it says, &lsquo;&hellip; <i>and if you&rsquo;re looking to find someone to write your break up songs about, baby, I&rsquo;m perfect.&rsquo;</i> Now listen, I don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo;a have any &lsquo;Bad Blood&rsquo; about this, and if this is a problem, we don&rsquo;t have to talk about it and we can just &lsquo;Shake It Off&rsquo;.&rdquo; James pauses, Niall&rsquo;s laughter echoing around the room, Harry&rsquo;s fingertips pinching his features as he blushes a shade of pink and smirks. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the song about?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry laughs, shaking his head as he begins his smooth response, &ldquo;Um, I think the thing with song writing is that, everybody writes from personal experience, y&rsquo;a know? It&rsquo;s not always necessarily what it sounds like it&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; James chimes, the audience&rsquo;s laughter making you smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, sometimes it is! I think it&rsquo;s up for, uh, it&rsquo;s open to interpretation of what anyone thinks it&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Swiftly dealt with,&rdquo; James retorts, Harry&rsquo;s smirk making your cheeks ache with a smile.</p><p>His final performance, his final song of the day is wonderful. With the audience singing and dancing along, you could <i>see</i> how happy his career made him, how much he loved being on stage and singing to hundreds and thousands of people &ndash; of individuals and an undeniable, loving fanbase who love and adore him as much as he would love and adore each and every one of them.</p><p>Words couldn&rsquo;t possibly describe how proud you were of him, how much you loved him.</p><p>Gemma smiles as you talk about your lunch date that would be occurring the following afternoon, your excitement exhibited on your features as you think of dining and boutiques that would be taking your money as you have a walk through downtown &ndash; a favourite destination you couldn&rsquo;t visit often but loved so much. Becoming a part of Harry&rsquo;s family meant becoming friendly with the people that meant the most to him &ndash; and you were incredibly grateful and felt so loved by everyone, especially Gemma; she had become one of your best friends in the quaint amount of time you had known her, truly gotten to know her, and hiding that you were engaged and getting married to her baby brother in less than six months was eating away at your stomach.</p><p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve felt like a light-year away.</p><p>Harry bumbles into the dressing room, a smile perked on his lips as he wraps his arms around your waist, lifting you lightly off your feet, kissing your lips as you cup his palms in your hands. His eyebrows furrow together in confusion as he hears a gasp at the entrance of the room, his eyes widening as he notices his older sister&rsquo;s narrowed vision on your finger, your engagement ring glimmering beneath the fluorescent lights.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I <i>knew</i> it!&rdquo; she grins, stepping inside and reaching for your hand, her fingertip tracing of the diamond delicately. &ldquo;Ugh, I&rsquo;m mad at you for not telling me, but I am too excited to show that, right now.&rdquo; She embraces you tightly, rocking you in her hold as she laughs, her attention travelling between you and the engagement ring permanently marked on your finger. &ldquo;Very nice choice, by the way, H. Have you told Mum, yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t told many people. We&rsquo;re waiting until New Year&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; he informs, his attention focused solely on her as he wraps his arm around your shoulder, your arms tucked around his waist and you nuzzle into his side. &ldquo;Gemma, if you tell Mum before we do, I am going to be <i>so</i> upset with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she squeaks, her lips etched into a grin with excitement. &ldquo;&rsquo;m expecting every detail of the proposal when you tell our mother. Oh God, she is going to be over the moon. She has been waiting for this for months.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>very</i> excited to tell her,&rdquo; you smile, your eyelashes fluttering against your cheeks as Harry kisses your hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an exciting New Year&rsquo;s &ndash; an exciting year &ndash; we could at least tell y&rsquo;a that.&rdquo;</p></p>",
