Is almost like being chosen for the size of her boobs. Love, true love goes way deeper than that FFS!! And Jon is surely not the one to chose his mate for those details only, what is he a bull in an arena?? (Lol at the end I dug into that haha sorry.)</p><p>Ah and Incest?? No sorry I&rsquo;ll not bury myself in that infinite discussion about what incest is the most incest between the two&hellip;I would keep laughing and sputtering my dinner cuz..come on lol</p><p>The things that I consider important are the actual dynamics in a healthy couple.</p><h2>LOVE IS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER&rsquo;S PRIORITIES</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start again. I state it before: I don&rsquo;t hate Sansa&rsquo;s character, on the contrary I find that her ch.development has been one of the nicest and subtlest till now. So Sansa meets with Jon after years apart. They were the most distant from each other amongst their siblings but when they meet, since difficulties bring us together, they find a piece of their family again. Ok that&rsquo;s nice, sweet moment.</p><p>Then, after only a scene and a bit of reminiscence of the old days Sansa starts to be her petty self again.</p><p>She, who doesn&rsquo;t know a block about the freefolk already starts to count how many men Jon &lsquo;gained&rsquo; (not saved?) for himself. She is already focused on retaking Winterfell. She wants revenge against Ramsay. She doesn&rsquo;t give a shot that Jon could be still in a state of shock after being MURDERED. And that he maybe would like to take some time for himself away from all those battles. No one ever talks about how much of a shock a battle is. Cuz men usually keep their emotions well hidden inside them like wine barrels. And Jon experienced Hardhome, a fking MASSACRE. Oh and then he died. But this is not important cuz the princess wants her castle back. </p><p>Careful, I don&rsquo;t say that it was wrong to take Winterfell back for them (go Starks go\ud83d\udcaa) but it pains me that she didn&rsquo;t even took into consideration that Jon could suffer from his past experiences and not want to dive so soon in the middle of the melee. </p><p>The letter has been the ultimate trigger that pushed Jon to the BoB. And Rickon.</p><p>Oh and then she calls into question both his way of commanding an army (when she discusses with him about their numbers against Ramsay) AND his way of ruling (with the Umbers and Karstarks children) and only after having seen him treat the situation with justice she admits that he is good at ruling. After having compared him to no other than Joff&hellip;(someone should say to her that not everyone is a tricky sick megalomaniac King just cuz he doesn&rsquo;t do what she wants?)</p><p>Oh and has she forgotten to warn Jon (the commander of their army) of a huuuge number of chivalry soldiers from the vale? That maybe could be of help before their men were slaughtered? But this has been addressed multiple times already I think&hellip;</p><p>My point is that: not once in these scenes I saw them as a unite front. She is always challenging him in everything he does. And not in the good way, the one that makes you do better, but in an annoying and hindering way that does nothing to help Jon in what he does. Even when he decides to go South she blames him for abandoning his people when he is doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE. (Let&rsquo;s not talk about Jon and his questionable habit to not discuss previously his decisions, but hey&hellip;he&rsquo;s the King after all this is one of the advantages of the position I guess)</p><p>So we have Sansa that doesn&rsquo;t support him and just keeps getting in his way in everything he does&hellip;</p><p>And then we have Daenerys of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals etc etc Mother of Dragons etc etc that starts with him in the exact opposite way. The first scene together alone is a telltale.</p><h2>LOVE IS CONSIDERING THE OTHER AS AN EQUAL</h2><p>She, who rightfully (from her past experiences and from the position of strength she comes in Westeros with) thinks herself in a higher/stronger position in that moment&hellip;she who has three fully grown dragons, who has the upper hand in every meaning in that room&hellip;she catches his signals</p><p>We have the first steps in their dance here.</p><p>She starts with her titles, he show her that titles mean nothing if the person who earned them isn&rsquo;t true to him/herself. Titles don&rsquo;t help with the dead. He&rsquo;s&hellip;King in the North? And many other things we know, but he is there for a higher purpose than showing how long he is able to piss.</p><p>The astonishing part is that she -who maybe was expecting to effectively have to show the length of her piss with a rude northener and stuck-up King- she understand that she has an equal in front of her. And immediately start to even the ground. </p><p>She goes down those steps that she (both figuratively and concretely) built to show that she was in a higher position of power. She 'flies down&rsquo; immediately and meets him on even ground. She catches immediately his desire to meet her in the middle and talk face to face. They share their experiences, and this is useful also to Jon, cuz he understand that he isn&rsquo;t in front of a simple woman, but a warrior that endured many atrocities. Like him.</p><p>The second scene with them together is the exact opposite of what happened with Sansa. She gives him access to the dragonglass mines.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry what???</p><p>She gives him something without giving him nothing in the words of Tyrion yeah. Politically this is smart. But she effectively took a step towards him voluntarily.</p><h2>LOVE IS LISTENING TO EACH OTHER DESIRES</h2><p>She listened to him, she took in account what he needed, and she fking gave it to him, without expecting anything in return. She didn&rsquo;t say: bend the knee and you&rsquo;ll have the dragonglass, she could&rsquo;ve done it, but she didn&rsquo;t. She talked with Tyrion about alliance without specifically talking about bending knees there. They are trying to build the first steps that could help both. </p><p>Then she starts to trust him more. And to know him more. And to believe in his story about ice zombies. And to consider to put aside her personal war to follow him with her whole army north&hellip;SHE PUTS HER WHOLE ARMY MADE OF FLESH AND BONES AND PEOPLE AND BRAINS AND MUSCLE, THAT SHE GAINED WITH COUNTLESS EFFORTS at Jon&rsquo;s service for 'his&rsquo; war, based on his words and some drawings on a wall, and she is offering all of this to him, she is ready to go, if he bends the knee than it is done. She goes. I am sorry if I don&rsquo;t understand the whole bending the knee issue. He knows what she wants when he departed from the North, and if she had withdrawn her request at some point of the story then she would have surely been addressed as weak and standoffish. </p><p>Anyway&hellip;</p><p>Can I just step over the whole 'she put in danger her son and her safety for him&rsquo; and go directly to the fact that Dany did a whole flip regardimg our favourite northern fool. She started from supposing he had to be bent to her will because of her previous experiences with men of power in general, thinking that she had some rights over him and over his title, to being unsure about the fact that she is deserving of his trust? That she is enough to be his Queen?</p><p>For me the most intimate and naked and meaningful scene between them was when Jon wakes up and finds her there. Waiting for him. Supporting him in a difficult moment. Guarding him when he is in his weakest state and NOT judging him for his decisions but instead admitting her errors. Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen admits that she thinks she could have done better. To a man. Something like this, I think, is the most trusting thing that a strong woman -that had earned her power showing men that she is stronger than them- can do. She andmits her doubts to him. 'Am I worthy of your thrust Jon? I hope it because I understood that you are a great man and your trust is something more precious than a simple allegiance&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what she low-key said during that hand holding. </p><p>I am sorry that all these little nuances sometimes don&rsquo;t reach the eyes and ears of someone or that some people just want to see what they WANT to see&hellip;anyway those people should be aware that Game of Thrones isn&rsquo;t just a sitcom where people shout what they feel in endless rants shaking hands in the air.</p><p>Now. I think I kept this long enough to cut it here. Also cuz I have to go and I don&rsquo;t know how to save an ask from the mobile phone without losing everything I wrote lol. Nonono, I cut it here and whatever other question is well accepted. </p><p>I hope I answered your question kind anon and have a nice day.</p>",

And many other things we know, but he is there for a higher purpose than showing how long he is able to piss.</p><p>The astonishing part is that she -who maybe was expecting to effectively have to show the length of her piss with a rude northener and stuck-up King- she understand that she has an equal in front of her. And immediately start to even the ground. </p><p>She goes down those steps that she (both figuratively and concretely) built to show that she was in a higher position of power. She 'flies down\u2019 immediately and meets him on even ground. She catches immediately his desire to meet her in the middle and talk face to face. They share their experiences, and this is useful also to Jon, cuz he understand that he isn\u2019t in front of a simple woman, but a warrior that endured many atrocities. Like him.</p><p>The second scene with them together is the exact opposite of what happened with Sansa. She gives him access to the dragonglass mines.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry what???</p><p>She gives him something without giving him nothing in the words of Tyrion yeah. Politically this is smart. But she effectively took a step towards him voluntarily.</p><h2>LOVE IS LISTENING TO EACH OTHER DESIRES</h2><p>She listened to him, she took in account what he needed, and she fking gave it to him, without expecting anything in return. She didn\u2019t say: bend the knee and you\u2019ll have the dragonglass, she could\u2019ve done it, but she didn\u2019t. She talked with Tyrion about alliance without specifically talking about bending knees there. They are trying to build the first steps that could help both. </p><p>Then she starts to trust him more. And to know him more. And to believe in his story about ice zombies. And to consider to put aside her personal war to follow him with her whole army north\u2026SHE PUTS HER WHOLE ARMY MADE OF FLESH AND BONES AND PEOPLE AND BRAINS AND MUSCLE, THAT SHE GAINED WITH COUNTLESS EFFORTS at Jon\u2019s service for 'his\u2019 war, based on his words and some drawings on a wall, and she is offering all of this to him, she is ready to go, if he bends the knee than it is done. She goes. I am sorry if I don\u2019t understand the whole bending the knee issue. He knows what she wants when he departed from the North, and if she had withdrawn her request at some point of the story then she would have surely been addressed as weak and standoffish. </p><p>Anyway\u2026</p><p>Can I just step over the whole 'she put in danger her son and her safety for him\u2019 and go directly to the fact that Dany did a whole flip regardimg our favourite northern fool. She started from supposing he had to be bent to her will because of her previous experiences with men of power in general, thinking that she had some rights over him and over his title, to being unsure about the fact that she is deserving of his trust? That she is enough to be his Queen?</p><p>For me the most intimate and naked and meaningful scene between them was when Jon wakes up and finds her there. Waiting for him. Supporting him in a difficult moment. Guarding him when he is in his weakest state and NOT judging him for his decisions but instead admitting her errors. Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen admits that she thinks she could have done better. To a man. Something like this, I think, is the most trusting thing that a strong woman -that had earned her power showing men that she is stronger than them- can do. She andmits her doubts to him. 'Am I worthy of your thrust Jon? I hope it because I understood that you are a great man and your trust is something more precious than a simple allegiance\u2019 that\u2019s what she low-key said during that hand holding. </p><p>I am sorry that all these little nuances sometimes don\u2019t reach the eyes and ears of someone or that some people just want to see what they WANT to see\u2026anyway those people should be aware that Game of Thrones isn\u2019t just a sitcom where people shout what they feel in endless rants shaking hands in the air.</p><p>Now. I think I kept this long enough to cut it here. Also cuz I have to go and I don\u2019t know how to save an ask from the mobile phone without losing everything I wrote lol. Nonono, I cut it here and whatever other question is well accepted. </p><p>I hope I answered your question kind anon and have a nice day.</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hello kind anon. </p><p>First of all pardon me but I&rsquo;ll do a bit of chicken dance to celebrate my first non-Jonerys centered ask (lol?)</p><p>And thanks for asking in a polite and respectful way btw&hellip;umm now are you sure you aren&rsquo;t some fellow Jonerys shipper that wants to joke with me asking a basic and generic question just for fun?? &#128514;</p><p>I am sorry but this is truly difficult to answer with less than an entire book of explanations (from the most elemental to the most specific) but I&rsquo;ll keep as short as I can.</p><p>If you think that Sansa is better for Jon then in the same way I have multiple reasons to think that she is not at all and that Dany is better for him. This goes beyond the fact that they are canon and that their stories parallels each others in such an astonishing way that I am almost shy in admitting how much they fking mirror their paths in life. </p><p>By the way their multiple parallels can be found in so many metas (much better explained than how this answer could ever hope to be) that is pointless for me to keep repeating the same points about it&hellip;</p><p><b>But let&rsquo;s watch it from a psicological point of view shall we? </b></p><p>So let&rsquo;s start with Sansa, I&rsquo;ll not dig in that redhead bullshit cuz I find truly denigrating for a woman to be chosen for the colour of her hair. Is almost like being chosen for the size of her boobs. Love, true love goes way deeper than that FFS!! And Jon is surely not the one to chose his mate for those details only, what is he a bull in an arena?? (Lol at the end I dug into that haha sorry.)</p><p>Ah and Incest?? No sorry I&rsquo;ll not bury myself in that infinite discussion about what incest is the most incest between the two&hellip;I would keep laughing and sputtering my dinner cuz..come on lol</p><p>The things that I consider important are the actual dynamics in a healthy couple.</p><h2>LOVE IS UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER&rsquo;S PRIORITIES</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s start again. I state it before: I don&rsquo;t hate Sansa&rsquo;s character, on the contrary I find that her ch.development has been one of the nicest and subtlest till now. So Sansa meets with Jon after years apart. They were the most distant from each other amongst their siblings but when they meet, since difficulties bring us together, they find a piece of their family again. Ok that&rsquo;s nice, sweet moment.</p><p>Then, after only a scene and a bit of reminiscence of the old days Sansa starts to be her petty self again.</p><p>She, who doesn&rsquo;t know a block about the freefolk already starts to count how many men Jon &lsquo;gained&rsquo; (not saved?) for himself. She is already focused on retaking Winterfell. She wants revenge against Ramsay. She doesn&rsquo;t give a shot that Jon could be still in a state of shock after being MURDERED. And that he maybe would like to take some time for himself away from all those battles. No one ever talks about how much of a shock a battle is. Cuz men usually keep their emotions well hidden inside them like wine barrels. And Jon experienced Hardhome, a fking MASSACRE. Oh and then he died. But this is not important cuz the princess wants her castle back. </p><p>Careful, I don&rsquo;t say that it was wrong to take Winterfell back for them (go Starks go&#128170;) but it pains me that she didn&rsquo;t even took into consideration that Jon could suffer from his past experiences and not want to dive so soon in the middle of the melee. </p><p>The letter has been the ultimate trigger that pushed Jon to the BoB. And Rickon.</p><p>Oh and then she calls into question both his way of commanding an army (when she discusses with him about their numbers against Ramsay) AND his way of ruling (with the Umbers and Karstarks children) and only after having seen him treat the situation with justice she admits that he is good at ruling. After having compared him to no other than Joff&hellip;(someone should say to her that not everyone is a tricky sick megalomaniac King just cuz he doesn&rsquo;t do what she wants?)</p><p>Oh and has she forgotten to warn Jon (the commander of their army) of a huuuge number of chivalry soldiers from the vale? That maybe could be of help before their men were slaughtered? But this has been addressed multiple times already I think&hellip;</p><p>My point is that: not once in these scenes I saw them as a unite front. She is always challenging him in everything he does. And not in the good way, the one that makes you do better, but in an annoying and hindering way that does nothing to help Jon in what he does. Even when he decides to go South she blames him for abandoning his people when he is doing THE EXACT OPPOSITE. (Let&rsquo;s not talk about Jon and his questionable habit to not discuss previously his decisions, but hey&hellip;he&rsquo;s the King after all this is one of the advantages of the position I guess)</p><p>So we have Sansa that doesn&rsquo;t support him and just keeps getting in his way in everything he does&hellip;</p><p>And then we have Daenerys of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals etc etc Mother of Dragons etc etc that starts with him in the exact opposite way. The first scene together alone is a telltale.</p><h2>LOVE IS CONSIDERING THE OTHER AS AN EQUAL</h2><p>She, who rightfully (from her past experiences and from the position of strength she comes in Westeros with) thinks herself in a higher/stronger position in that moment&hellip;she who has three fully grown dragons, who has the upper hand in every meaning in that room&hellip;she catches his signals</p><p>We have the first steps in their dance here.</p><p>She starts with her titles, he show her that titles mean nothing if the person who earned them isn&rsquo;t true to him/herself.

        "answer": "<p>Like I said before it was the only choice Sansa had. Sansa by being betrothed to Joffrey now had two different allegiances that would normally not get tested. When it did she had to make a choice between infuriating one group or the other and she chose neither. It\u2019s not her fault that Cersei was out for blood, it\u2019s not her fault that Robert had the spine of a noodle and it\u2019s not her fault that Ned didn\u2019t argue harder. In fact Sansa was unprepared for the\u00a0\u2018trial.\u2019 They were looking for Arya when Cersei\u2019s men seized her and an impromptu hearing was set up quickly while Sansa was sleeping. She was woken up and taken to where everyone was gathered. She arrived while Arya was testifying and she got to hear Renly laughing at Joffrey openly. You don\u2019t have to be genius to understand how that would anger Joffrey, to be laughed at for being beaten by a little girl especially after he refuted with a different version of the events. So Sansa has 2 things to keep in mind- Joffrey is invested in not looking weak and Joffrey can be scary (to Sansa) when he\u2019s angry. After that, there was only one path to take.</p><blockquote><p>\n\nShe blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.

Basically these people watch torture scenes in which the hero taunts his captors and spits blood on their faces and they thought,\u00a0\u2018that\u2019s a smart, long term plan.\u2019 Thank goodness Sansa is smarter.</p>",

They hate Lady of Winterfell Sansa and Queen in the North Sansa. By not being a Stark somehow, Sansa is to be denied a Stark happy ending meaning she isn\u2019t to be elevated to either the same level as her siblings or above them. In fact many of them want her to be punished as an enemy of the Starks. Like I said they\u2019re pieces of shit.</p>",
