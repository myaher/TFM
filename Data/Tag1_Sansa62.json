        "answer": "<p><b>Black Sails<br/></b></p><p>Sorry for slow answering. It`s very predictable for people who know me long enough, so I tried to do it more expanded at least.</p><p>1.Favorite Male Character</p><p>Woodes Rogers. In stories about pirates and privateers I usually like these ones who were something else except these roles (like Dampier or Drake), so my simpathy is very predictable. I can`t say I really like his arc in season 4, it feels forced, something like showranners needs to make somebody villain for justifiing fandom faves ( and it`s without sense for me, because almost everyone in this show did a lot of shit), but Luke Roberts was amazing, so I was emotionally involved in Woodes story very much.</p><p>2.Favorite Female Character</p><p>Eleanor Guthrie. She was my fave since season one, and despite some other things changed, my love to Eleanor stays constant. There are very few characters in any other fandoms who were so important for me during my fandom life as Eleanor, I think she is my absolutely favorite character amongst all my faves now.. Amongs minor characters my faves Marion Guthrie (Eleanor`s Grandma) and Mrs Hudson.</p><p>3.Least Favorite Character</p><p> James Flint and Thomas Hamilton. Flint`s story is simbol of one of most toxic trop for me: justifying bad things that person does, because something hurts him before. There are many other aspects, I but this one is main. </p><p>4. Favorite Ship</p><p>Woodes/Eleanor. But honestly for me it was rather sort of threesome Woodes/Eleanor/Nassau. Since beginning this relationship was about Nassau, then became more and more personal (but still stayed about Nassau anyway). There are many paralles and nuances I like, but I think my favorite thing about them is that they both fight for civilization, but not really on good terms with it. </p><p>I never believed much in happy ending for them in show, but in my headcanon they leave New Providence, but several years later return in Nassau.</p><p>5. Favorite Friendship</p><p>Eleanor and Max in season 3 (lesser in 4). I have a mixed feelings about their dinamic, honestly, they are interesting, but also I dislike Max often blames Eleanor in things that other people did. But anyway I like to write about them in fics, and I find as friends they are more interesting than as romantic couple. </p><p>Also I always have soft spot for Rogers and Mrs Hudson, but I realize, it`s not friendship in common way. But they liked each other enough at least, so she is my BROTP with him.</p><p>6. Favorite Quote</p><p>Civilization has a number of faces. Because it`s about things I love in idea of civilization. Civilization is complicated thing with many aspects, bad and good and neither. Civilization is incredible gift, and civilization is a bitch eating her children. Civilization is worth fighting for, but sometimes collateral damage is awful. It`s endless paradox and we all live inside it.</p><p>7. Worst Character Death (if any)</p><p>For me it`s definitely was Eleanor. Not only because she is my fave, but it was written in stupid and forced way, like showranners wanted to kill her off anyway and were too lazy to make it well-written at least. Death of favorite character hurts almost always, but when it`s looks like bad movie it feels more worse.</p><p>8. This made me so happy you have no idea Moment</p><p>Almost all happy moments in that show very short, so remembering it is difficult. I definitely was very happy in 404, when Eleanor and Woodes looked at each other in spyglasses, but it was so short\u2026</p><p>9. Saddest Moment</p><p>Shit. That scene in 406 with Rogers and dead Eleanor. Even now it demands efforts to write about it.</p><p>(I have another awful memory related with scene. Months or little more later final episode official Black Sails account on tumblr posted gif with that scene and there was negative comment about Woodes/Eleanor. I dont think anything they posts have a sense for interpretation show, BS advertising company always was very primitive and based on cheap manipulations, but WTF? \u00a0What`s wrong with these people? Do they think it`s funny or something? Am I only person who think there must be borders for advertising tricks?)</p><p>10. Favorite Location</p><p>Havana. I love Nassau, but Havana was visually perfect in every moment, even despite script was questionable.</p><p><b>Game of Thrones</b></p><p>I was huge fan of GRRM books before they became show, and I like first season but then I lost interest to this story. There was no new books long time, and I dont believe Martin will finish it, and show became worse and worse with every season. I watched 801 and my almost only emotion was boredom. Bad written, bad directed, waste of time.</p><p>1.Favorite Male Character</p><p>I have not favorite male character now. When I read books, I have faves, but I lost interest to them (Sandor, John) or their character development was disappointing (Jaimee) or something else. </p><p>2.Favorite Female Character</p><p>Sansa Stark. She was my fave since first book. It`s very unusual, when such female type gets POV in fantasy book (even in more mainstream book it`s rather rare thing), so it was very interesting and refreshing for me. She`s only reason why I still sometimes watch that show.</p><p>3.Least Favorite Character</p><p>Tirion.</p><p>4.Favorite Ship</p><p>Petyr/Sansa, I think. It`s strange sort of shipping, I never wished them happy ending in books or show (it was too much obvious, that storyline inevitable will end badly for Petyr), not that dark mentor/apprentice relationship is sort of kink for me, and I like to watch modern AU video with them.</p><p>In books I shipped Sandor/Sansa but in show accents were changed.</p><p>5. Favorite Friendship</p><p>Sorry, I dont remember.</p><p>6. Favorite Quote</p><p>I realized I even have not favorite quote in it anymore.</p><p>7.Worst Character Death (if any)</p><p>They kills characters off so often, I almost have no emotions about it. But Petyr`s death was definitely very stupid written.</p><p>8. This made me so happy you have no idea Moment</p><p>In books all Sandor/Sansa moments. In show\u2026 I`m not sure. Maybe when Sansa feed Ramsy to his dogs. And definitely short Luke Roberts role as Arthur Dayne.</p><p>9. Saddest Moment</p><p>I really don`t remember.</p><p>10.

It`s very predictable for people who know me long enough, so I tried to do it more expanded at least.</p><p>1.Favorite Male Character</p><p>Woodes Rogers. In stories about pirates and privateers I usually like these ones who were something else except these roles (like Dampier or Drake), so my simpathy is very predictable. I can`t say I really like his arc in season 4, it feels forced, something like showranners needs to make somebody villain for justifiing fandom faves ( and it`s without sense for me, because almost everyone in this show did a lot of shit), but Luke Roberts was amazing, so I was emotionally involved in Woodes story very much.</p><p>2.Favorite Female Character</p><p>Eleanor Guthrie. She was my fave since season one, and despite some other things changed, my love to Eleanor stays constant. There are very few characters in any other fandoms who were so important for me during my fandom life as Eleanor, I think she is my absolutely favorite character amongst all my faves now.. Amongs minor characters my faves Marion Guthrie (Eleanor`s Grandma) and Mrs Hudson.</p><p>3.Least Favorite Character</p><p> James Flint and Thomas Hamilton. Flint`s story is simbol of one of most toxic trop for me: justifying bad things that person does, because something hurts him before. There are many other aspects, I but this one is main. </p><p>4. Favorite Ship</p><p>Woodes/Eleanor. But honestly for me it was rather sort of threesome Woodes/Eleanor/Nassau. Since beginning this relationship was about Nassau, then became more and more personal (but still stayed about Nassau anyway). There are many paralles and nuances I like, but I think my favorite thing about them is that they both fight for civilization, but not really on good terms with it. </p><p>I never believed much in happy ending for them in show, but in my headcanon they leave New Providence, but several years later return in Nassau.</p><p>5. Favorite Friendship</p><p>Eleanor and Max in season 3 (lesser in 4). I have a mixed feelings about their dinamic, honestly, they are interesting, but also I dislike Max often blames Eleanor in things that other people did. But anyway I like to write about them in fics, and I find as friends they are more interesting than as romantic couple. </p><p>Also I always have soft spot for Rogers and Mrs Hudson, but I realize, it`s not friendship in common way. But they liked each other enough at least, so she is my BROTP with him.</p><p>6. Favorite Quote</p><p>Civilization has a number of faces. Because it`s about things I love in idea of civilization. Civilization is complicated thing with many aspects, bad and good and neither. Civilization is incredible gift, and civilization is a bitch eating her children. Civilization is worth fighting for, but sometimes collateral damage is awful. It`s endless paradox and we all live inside it.</p><p>7. Worst Character Death (if any)</p><p>For me it`s definitely was Eleanor. Not only because she is my fave, but it was written in stupid and forced way, like showranners wanted to kill her off anyway and were too lazy to make it well-written at least. Death of favorite character hurts almost always, but when it`s looks like bad movie it feels more worse.</p><p>8. This made me so happy you have no idea Moment</p><p>Almost all happy moments in that show very short, so remembering it is difficult. I definitely was very happy in 404, when Eleanor and Woodes looked at each other in spyglasses, but it was so short\u2026</p><p>9. Saddest Moment</p><p>Shit. That scene in 406 with Rogers and dead Eleanor. Even now it demands efforts to write about it.</p><p>(I have another awful memory related with scene. Months or little more later final episode official Black Sails account on tumblr posted gif with that scene and there was negative comment about Woodes/Eleanor. I dont think anything they posts have a sense for interpretation show, BS advertising company always was very primitive and based on cheap manipulations, but WTF? \u00a0What`s wrong with these people? Do they think it`s funny or something? Am I only person who think there must be borders for advertising tricks?)</p><p>10. Favorite Location</p><p>Havana. I love Nassau, but Havana was visually perfect in every moment, even despite script was questionable.</p><p><b>Game of Thrones</b></p><p>I was huge fan of GRRM books before they became show, and I like first season but then I lost interest to this story. There was no new books long time, and I dont believe Martin will finish it, and show became worse and worse with every season. I watched 801 and my almost only emotion was boredom. Bad written, bad directed, waste of time.</p><p>1.Favorite Male Character</p><p>I have not favorite male character now. When I read books, I have faves, but I lost interest to them (Sandor, John) or their character development was disappointing (Jaimee) or something else. </p><p>2.Favorite Female Character</p><p>Sansa Stark. She was my fave since first book. It`s very unusual, when such female type gets POV in fantasy book (even in more mainstream book it`s rather rare thing), so it was very interesting and refreshing for me. She`s only reason why I still sometimes watch that show.</p><p>3.Least Favorite Character</p><p>Tirion.</p><p>4.Favorite Ship</p><p>Petyr/Sansa, I think. It`s strange sort of shipping, I never wished them happy ending in books or show (it was too much obvious, that storyline inevitable will end badly for Petyr), not that dark mentor/apprentice relationship is sort of kink for me, and I like to watch modern AU video with them.</p><p>In books I shipped Sandor/Sansa but in show accents were changed.</p><p>5. Favorite Friendship</p><p>Sorry, I dont remember.</p><p>6. Favorite Quote</p><p>I realized I even have not favorite quote in it anymore.</p><p>7.Worst Character Death (if any)</p><p>They kills characters off so often, I almost have no emotions about it. But Petyr`s death was definitely very stupid written.</p><p>8. This made me so happy you have no idea Moment</p><p>In books all Sandor/Sansa moments. In show\u2026 I`m not sure. Maybe when Sansa feed Ramsy to his dogs. And definitely short Luke Roberts role as Arthur Dayne.</p><p>9. Saddest Moment</p><p>I really don`t remember.</p><p>10.
