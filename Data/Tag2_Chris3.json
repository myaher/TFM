In one comic. And Red Skull (a character I fucking hate) literally said she was Jewish and roma but he said Gypsy. So I have proof for all of this. So don&rsquo;t be like &ldquo;sHe IsN&rsquo;t A pOc&rdquo; mcu stans. She has never been white and will never be white and you people defending this are fucking awful.

his face contorted with\nguilt. \u00a0</p><p>Being in such close proximity of him, especially after\nthinking about your prom night, made you want to kiss those lips once\nagain. \u00a0Your body was winning this battle\nover your heart at the moment and you felt betrayed. \u00a0But it had been so long since anyone has\ntouched you; the sexual tension was thick in the room. </p><p>You saw Chris rake his eyes down your body and onto your\nbare legs; he licked his lips at the sight of you. \u00a0It was confusing because even though he\nkissed you on the cheek back in the day, and you lost your virginity to him, he\nnever once made a move on you; you never knew how he truly felt about you.</p><p>The way his eyes were taking in your body made you flush\nunder his gaze; and want him even more. \nYou pressed your thighs together as you stood in front of him, needing\nthat friction and you felt the dampness in your underwear. \u00a0<i>What\nthe fuck is this man doing to me </i>you thought to yourself. \u00a0</p><p>Chris stepped even closer to you, a small smile appearing on\nhis lips as he saw you clench your thighs together. \u00a0\u201cJess, I came over here to..\u201d he began to say\nbut you cut him off. </p><p>Throwing your arms around his neck, you pulled him down to\nyour lips for a searing kiss; Chris nearly losing his balance. \u00a0Fortunately he recovered as he pulled you\ncloser to him. \u00a0You tilted your head,\nwanting to deepen the kiss as you felt his tongue on your lips. \u00a0Just like the first time the two of you\nkissed, you parted your lips for him and moaned when you felt his tongue on\nyours. \u00a0It was heaven all over again as\nyour hand fisted in his hair, pulling his face even closer. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 right hand trailed down your back until he reached\nyour lower back, pulling you closer to him. \nYou instantly felt the hardness in his jeans and it turned you on\nknowing you had this effect on him. \n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m forgiven?\u201d he asked between kisses. \u00a0</p><p>You pulled him away by his hair, staring straight into his\neyes. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still fucking mad at you,\u201d\nyou declared before attaching your lips right back to his. \u00a0</p><p>Chris reached down and gripped the back of your thighs\ncausing you to jump as he pulled you up. \nYou wrapped your legs around his lean waist, holding you close to him as\nthe two of you explored each other\u2019s mouths like you did on the night of\nprom. \u00a0This time you weren\u2019t as\ninexperienced however. \u00a0This time felt\neven more magical than the first. \u00a0</p><p>You ground your hips closer to him, causing him to moan into\nyour mouth at the feeling. \u00a0Chris began\nwalking the two of you through the house and up the stairs; banging against\nwalls every now and then as the two of you laughed before going back to\nkissing. \u00a0</p><p>It was a rush, being like this with Chris. \u00a0Not because he was a celebrity; hell, you\nnever thought of him that way. \u00a0But\nbecause this was Chris in general, the man who you grew up with; the man you\nended up falling in love with. \u00a0</p><p>Once he got to your bedroom, he dropped you on the bed. \u00a0He stood towering above you; both of your\nchests heaving and lips full from kissing. \nHe gripped his t-shirt in his hands and pulled it over his head. \u00a0Your mouth parted at the sight of his upper\nform naked in front of you. \u00a0He was built,\nlike a damn Grecian God. \u00a0Your eyes\ntraveled down to his happy trail, disappearing into his jeans; your mouth began\nto water. \u00a0</p><p>You moved up the bed so your head was on your pillows as\nChris came crawling up your body, making you shiver in anticipation. \u00a0\u201cTell me to stop and I will,\u201d he husked out\nas his lips connected with your neck. \u00a0A\ngasp left your throat as his tongue teased your sweet spot. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better not fucking stop,\u201d you whimpered. \u00a0</p><p>His hand trailed south from your stomach to your legs, which\nyou parted eagerly for him. \u00a0His lips\nnever left your neck as he teased your wet folds through your underwear. \u00a0\u201cChris,\u201d you cried out for him, wanting his\ntouch. \u00a0</p><p>He chuckled into your neck before dipping his fingers into\nyour panties; an animalistic groan leaving his throat at the feeling of your\nwetness. \u00a0\u201cFuck Jess,\u201d he growled as he\nripped your panties down your legs. \u00a0You\nhelped to kick them off, then opened yourself back up for him; a needing so\ngreat you had never experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>Chris teased your folds back and forth, spreading your\nwetness around and up to your aching clit as you cried out in pleasure. \u00a0You gripped onto the back of his neck as he\nsunk a finger into your core. \u00a0\u201cYes!\u201d you\ncried out as your hips began to move. \u00a0</p><p>It had been way too long since someone had touched you this\nway. \u00a0It had been nothing but your own\nfingers or magic wand, but it didn\u2019t compare to what Chris was doing to you\nright now. \u00a0</p><p>He added a second finger into your tight channel, spreading\nyou open as his thumb circled your clit with such expertise. \u00a0It was one thing to orgasm at your own hands,\nbut when someone else brought you to an orgasm, it was a million times\nbetter. \u00a0With Chris\u2019 magic fingers and\nhis mouth at your throat, you felt your high begin to build as your moans\nechoed throughout the room. \u00a0Your grip on\nhis neck got tighter as you pulled his face to your lips, ravishing them with\nyour own. \u00a0</p><p>Your body began to tingle, your legs beginning to grow stiff\nas you felt your orgasm burst through you like a current. \u00a0Chris\u2019 fingers still working inside of you,\nprolonging your orgasm into nothing you had ever experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>As you came down from your high, Chris slowly removed his\nfingers from you and you whined in protest of feeling empty. \u00a0Chris chuckled lightly as he got up from the\nbed and removed his pants. \u00a0With hazy\neyes, you turned to look at him. \u00a0It had\nbeen a long time ago since prom, but you didn\u2019t remember him being THAT\nendowed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you still want this Jessica?\u201d Chris urged. \u00a0You licked your lips and nodded your head at\nhim. \u00a0He moved to position himself over\nyou before cursing. \u00a0\u201cShit. \u00a0I don\u2019t have any protection.\u201d</p><p>You smiled up at him, loving how protective he was being, no\npun intended. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m clean and on birth\ncontrol.\u201d</p><p>Chris gave you a lop sided grin, one of your favorite types\nof smiles on him. \u00a0He hovered above you,\nresting on his left arm as he used his right hand to line himself up. \u00a0You felt him at your entrance as you willed\nyourself to relax. \u00a0He began to push in\nslowly as you bit down on your lip. \u00a0It\nwas a bit uncomfortable at first as it had been a long time for you, but the\nmore you relaxed, the more pleasurable it felt. \n</p><p>He stilled once he was fully sheathed inside of you; his\nhead bowing down to rest between your head and shoulders. \u00a0\u201cShit you are fucking tight,\u201d he rasped out;\nhis heated breath fanning your warm skin. \n</p><p>Your eyes locked with his and you nodded your head, letting\nhim know you were ready. \u00a0He slowly began\nto move his hips;

his face contorted with\nguilt. \u00a0</p><p>Being in such close proximity of him, especially after\nthinking about your prom night, made you want to kiss those lips once\nagain. \u00a0Your body was winning this battle\nover your heart at the moment and you felt betrayed. \u00a0But it had been so long since anyone has\ntouched you; the sexual tension was thick in the room. </p><p>You saw Chris rake his eyes down your body and onto your\nbare legs; he licked his lips at the sight of you. \u00a0It was confusing because even though he\nkissed you on the cheek back in the day, and you lost your virginity to him, he\nnever once made a move on you; you never knew how he truly felt about you.</p><p>The way his eyes were taking in your body made you flush\nunder his gaze; and want him even more. \nYou pressed your thighs together as you stood in front of him, needing\nthat friction and you felt the dampness in your underwear. \u00a0<i>What\nthe fuck is this man doing to me </i>you thought to yourself. \u00a0</p><p>Chris stepped even closer to you, a small smile appearing on\nhis lips as he saw you clench your thighs together. \u00a0\u201cJess, I came over here to..\u201d he began to say\nbut you cut him off. </p><p>Throwing your arms around his neck, you pulled him down to\nyour lips for a searing kiss; Chris nearly losing his balance. \u00a0Fortunately he recovered as he pulled you\ncloser to him. \u00a0You tilted your head,\nwanting to deepen the kiss as you felt his tongue on your lips. \u00a0Just like the first time the two of you\nkissed, you parted your lips for him and moaned when you felt his tongue on\nyours. \u00a0It was heaven all over again as\nyour hand fisted in his hair, pulling his face even closer. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 right hand trailed down your back until he reached\nyour lower back, pulling you closer to him. \nYou instantly felt the hardness in his jeans and it turned you on\nknowing you had this effect on him. \n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m forgiven?\u201d he asked between kisses. \u00a0</p><p>You pulled him away by his hair, staring straight into his\neyes. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still fucking mad at you,\u201d\nyou declared before attaching your lips right back to his. \u00a0</p><p>Chris reached down and gripped the back of your thighs\ncausing you to jump as he pulled you up. \nYou wrapped your legs around his lean waist, holding you close to him as\nthe two of you explored each other\u2019s mouths like you did on the night of\nprom. \u00a0This time you weren\u2019t as\ninexperienced however. \u00a0This time felt\neven more magical than the first. \u00a0</p><p>You ground your hips closer to him, causing him to moan into\nyour mouth at the feeling. \u00a0Chris began\nwalking the two of you through the house and up the stairs; banging against\nwalls every now and then as the two of you laughed before going back to\nkissing. \u00a0</p><p>It was a rush, being like this with Chris. \u00a0Not because he was a celebrity; hell, you\nnever thought of him that way. \u00a0But\nbecause this was Chris in general, the man who you grew up with; the man you\nended up falling in love with. \u00a0</p><p>Once he got to your bedroom, he dropped you on the bed. \u00a0He stood towering above you; both of your\nchests heaving and lips full from kissing. \nHe gripped his t-shirt in his hands and pulled it over his head. \u00a0Your mouth parted at the sight of his upper\nform naked in front of you. \u00a0He was built,\nlike a damn Grecian God. \u00a0Your eyes\ntraveled down to his happy trail, disappearing into his jeans; your mouth began\nto water. \u00a0</p><p>You moved up the bed so your head was on your pillows as\nChris came crawling up your body, making you shiver in anticipation. \u00a0\u201cTell me to stop and I will,\u201d he husked out\nas his lips connected with your neck. \u00a0A\ngasp left your throat as his tongue teased your sweet spot. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better not fucking stop,\u201d you whimpered. \u00a0</p><p>His hand trailed south from your stomach to your legs, which\nyou parted eagerly for him. \u00a0His lips\nnever left your neck as he teased your wet folds through your underwear. \u00a0\u201cChris,\u201d you cried out for him, wanting his\ntouch. \u00a0</p><p>He chuckled into your neck before dipping his fingers into\nyour panties; an animalistic groan leaving his throat at the feeling of your\nwetness. \u00a0\u201cFuck Jess,\u201d he growled as he\nripped your panties down your legs. \u00a0You\nhelped to kick them off, then opened yourself back up for him; a needing so\ngreat you had never experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>Chris teased your folds back and forth, spreading your\nwetness around and up to your aching clit as you cried out in pleasure. \u00a0You gripped onto the back of his neck as he\nsunk a finger into your core. \u00a0\u201cYes!\u201d you\ncried out as your hips began to move. \u00a0</p><p>It had been way too long since someone had touched you this\nway. \u00a0It had been nothing but your own\nfingers or magic wand, but it didn\u2019t compare to what Chris was doing to you\nright now. \u00a0</p><p>He added a second finger into your tight channel, spreading\nyou open as his thumb circled your clit with such expertise. \u00a0It was one thing to orgasm at your own hands,\nbut when someone else brought you to an orgasm, it was a million times\nbetter. \u00a0With Chris\u2019 magic fingers and\nhis mouth at your throat, you felt your high begin to build as your moans\nechoed throughout the room. \u00a0Your grip on\nhis neck got tighter as you pulled his face to your lips, ravishing them with\nyour own. \u00a0</p><p>Your body began to tingle, your legs beginning to grow stiff\nas you felt your orgasm burst through you like a current. \u00a0Chris\u2019 fingers still working inside of you,\nprolonging your orgasm into nothing you had ever experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>As you came down from your high, Chris slowly removed his\nfingers from you and you whined in protest of feeling empty. \u00a0Chris chuckled lightly as he got up from the\nbed and removed his pants. \u00a0With hazy\neyes, you turned to look at him. \u00a0It had\nbeen a long time ago since prom, but you didn\u2019t remember him being THAT\nendowed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you still want this Jessica?\u201d Chris urged. \u00a0You licked your lips and nodded your head at\nhim. \u00a0He moved to position himself over\nyou before cursing. \u00a0\u201cShit. \u00a0I don\u2019t have any protection.\u201d</p><p>You smiled up at him, loving how protective he was being, no\npun intended. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m clean and on birth\ncontrol.\u201d</p><p>Chris gave you a lop sided grin, one of your favorite types\nof smiles on him. \u00a0He hovered above you,\nresting on his left arm as he used his right hand to line himself up. \u00a0You felt him at your entrance as you willed\nyourself to relax. \u00a0He began to push in\nslowly as you bit down on your lip. \u00a0It\nwas a bit uncomfortable at first as it had been a long time for you, but the\nmore you relaxed, the more pleasurable it felt. \n</p><p>He stilled once he was fully sheathed inside of you; his\nhead bowing down to rest between your head and shoulders. \u00a0\u201cShit you are fucking tight,\u201d he rasped out;\nhis heated breath fanning your warm skin. \n</p><p>Your eyes locked with his and you nodded your head, letting\nhim know you were ready. \u00a0He slowly began\nto move his hips; his cock pulling out of you before gradually pushing in\nagain. \u00a0It felt euphoric to feel this\nfull; your eyes rolling back into your head at his slow movements. \u00a0Your inner walls twitched against his\nfullness involuntarily causing Chris to groan in pleasure. \u00a0</p><p>Placing your feet on the bed, you began to move your hips\nupwards, letting him know you wanted more and he happily obliged. \u00a0He set a steady rhythm at first, before\nbeginning to pound into you. \u00a0His cock\nwas thick, filling you up with each thrust and you never wanted it to end. \u00a0</p><p>You felt your walls begin to tighten right as Chris stopped\nhis movement. \u00a0\u201cWhat,\u201d you gasped out,\n\u201cwhy did you stop?\u201d</p><p>He breathed heavily, looking into your eyes. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t want this to end yet.\u201d \u00a0He flipped the two of you over with ease as\nyou now straddled him;

his face contorted with\nguilt. \u00a0</p><p>Being in such close proximity of him, especially after\nthinking about your prom night, made you want to kiss those lips once\nagain. \u00a0Your body was winning this battle\nover your heart at the moment and you felt betrayed. \u00a0But it had been so long since anyone has\ntouched you; the sexual tension was thick in the room. </p><p>You saw Chris rake his eyes down your body and onto your\nbare legs; he licked his lips at the sight of you. \u00a0It was confusing because even though he\nkissed you on the cheek back in the day, and you lost your virginity to him, he\nnever once made a move on you; you never knew how he truly felt about you.</p><p>The way his eyes were taking in your body made you flush\nunder his gaze; and want him even more. \nYou pressed your thighs together as you stood in front of him, needing\nthat friction and you felt the dampness in your underwear. \u00a0<i>What\nthe fuck is this man doing to me </i>you thought to yourself. \u00a0</p><p>Chris stepped even closer to you, a small smile appearing on\nhis lips as he saw you clench your thighs together. \u00a0\u201cJess, I came over here to..\u201d he began to say\nbut you cut him off. </p><p>Throwing your arms around his neck, you pulled him down to\nyour lips for a searing kiss; Chris nearly losing his balance. \u00a0Fortunately he recovered as he pulled you\ncloser to him. \u00a0You tilted your head,\nwanting to deepen the kiss as you felt his tongue on your lips. \u00a0Just like the first time the two of you\nkissed, you parted your lips for him and moaned when you felt his tongue on\nyours. \u00a0It was heaven all over again as\nyour hand fisted in his hair, pulling his face even closer. \u00a0</p><p>Chris\u2019 right hand trailed down your back until he reached\nyour lower back, pulling you closer to him. \nYou instantly felt the hardness in his jeans and it turned you on\nknowing you had this effect on him. \n\u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m forgiven?\u201d he asked between kisses. \u00a0</p><p>You pulled him away by his hair, staring straight into his\neyes. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m still fucking mad at you,\u201d\nyou declared before attaching your lips right back to his. \u00a0</p><p>Chris reached down and gripped the back of your thighs\ncausing you to jump as he pulled you up. \nYou wrapped your legs around his lean waist, holding you close to him as\nthe two of you explored each other\u2019s mouths like you did on the night of\nprom. \u00a0This time you weren\u2019t as\ninexperienced however. \u00a0This time felt\neven more magical than the first. \u00a0</p><p>You ground your hips closer to him, causing him to moan into\nyour mouth at the feeling. \u00a0Chris began\nwalking the two of you through the house and up the stairs; banging against\nwalls every now and then as the two of you laughed before going back to\nkissing. \u00a0</p><p>It was a rush, being like this with Chris. \u00a0Not because he was a celebrity; hell, you\nnever thought of him that way. \u00a0But\nbecause this was Chris in general, the man who you grew up with; the man you\nended up falling in love with. \u00a0</p><p>Once he got to your bedroom, he dropped you on the bed. \u00a0He stood towering above you; both of your\nchests heaving and lips full from kissing. \nHe gripped his t-shirt in his hands and pulled it over his head. \u00a0Your mouth parted at the sight of his upper\nform naked in front of you. \u00a0He was built,\nlike a damn Grecian God. \u00a0Your eyes\ntraveled down to his happy trail, disappearing into his jeans; your mouth began\nto water. \u00a0</p><p>You moved up the bed so your head was on your pillows as\nChris came crawling up your body, making you shiver in anticipation. \u00a0\u201cTell me to stop and I will,\u201d he husked out\nas his lips connected with your neck. \u00a0A\ngasp left your throat as his tongue teased your sweet spot. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou better not fucking stop,\u201d you whimpered. \u00a0</p><p>His hand trailed south from your stomach to your legs, which\nyou parted eagerly for him. \u00a0His lips\nnever left your neck as he teased your wet folds through your underwear. \u00a0\u201cChris,\u201d you cried out for him, wanting his\ntouch. \u00a0</p><p>He chuckled into your neck before dipping his fingers into\nyour panties; an animalistic groan leaving his throat at the feeling of your\nwetness. \u00a0\u201cFuck Jess,\u201d he growled as he\nripped your panties down your legs. \u00a0You\nhelped to kick them off, then opened yourself back up for him; a needing so\ngreat you had never experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>Chris teased your folds back and forth, spreading your\nwetness around and up to your aching clit as you cried out in pleasure. \u00a0You gripped onto the back of his neck as he\nsunk a finger into your core. \u00a0\u201cYes!\u201d you\ncried out as your hips began to move. \u00a0</p><p>It had been way too long since someone had touched you this\nway. \u00a0It had been nothing but your own\nfingers or magic wand, but it didn\u2019t compare to what Chris was doing to you\nright now. \u00a0</p><p>He added a second finger into your tight channel, spreading\nyou open as his thumb circled your clit with such expertise. \u00a0It was one thing to orgasm at your own hands,\nbut when someone else brought you to an orgasm, it was a million times\nbetter. \u00a0With Chris\u2019 magic fingers and\nhis mouth at your throat, you felt your high begin to build as your moans\nechoed throughout the room. \u00a0Your grip on\nhis neck got tighter as you pulled his face to your lips, ravishing them with\nyour own. \u00a0</p><p>Your body began to tingle, your legs beginning to grow stiff\nas you felt your orgasm burst through you like a current. \u00a0Chris\u2019 fingers still working inside of you,\nprolonging your orgasm into nothing you had ever experienced before. \u00a0</p><p>As you came down from your high, Chris slowly removed his\nfingers from you and you whined in protest of feeling empty. \u00a0Chris chuckled lightly as he got up from the\nbed and removed his pants. \u00a0With hazy\neyes, you turned to look at him. \u00a0It had\nbeen a long time ago since prom, but you didn\u2019t remember him being THAT\nendowed. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you still want this Jessica?\u201d Chris urged. \u00a0You licked your lips and nodded your head at\nhim. \u00a0He moved to position himself over\nyou before cursing. \u00a0\u201cShit. \u00a0I don\u2019t have any protection.\u201d</p><p>You smiled up at him, loving how protective he was being, no\npun intended. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m clean and on birth\ncontrol.\u201d</p><p>Chris gave you a lop sided grin, one of your favorite types\nof smiles on him. \u00a0He hovered above you,\nresting on his left arm as he used his right hand to line himself up. \u00a0You felt him at your entrance as you willed\nyourself to relax. \u00a0He began to push in\nslowly as you bit down on your lip. \u00a0It\nwas a bit uncomfortable at first as it had been a long time for you, but the\nmore you relaxed, the more pleasurable it felt. \n</p><p>He stilled once he was fully sheathed inside of you; his\nhead bowing down to rest between your head and shoulders. \u00a0\u201cShit you are fucking tight,\u201d he rasped out;\nhis heated breath fanning your warm skin. \n</p><p>Your eyes locked with his and you nodded your head, letting\nhim know you were ready. \u00a0He slowly began\nto move his hips; his cock pulling out of you before gradually pushing in\nagain. \u00a0It felt euphoric to feel this\nfull; your eyes rolling back into your head at his slow movements. \u00a0Your inner walls twitched against his\nfullness involuntarily causing Chris to groan in pleasure. \u00a0</p><p>Placing your feet on the bed, you began to move your hips\nupwards, letting him know you wanted more and he happily obliged. \u00a0He set a steady rhythm at first, before\nbeginning to pound into you. \u00a0His cock\nwas thick, filling you up with each thrust and you never wanted it to end. \u00a0</p><p>You felt your walls begin to tighten right as Chris stopped\nhis movement. \u00a0\u201cWhat,\u201d you gasped out,\n\u201cwhy did you stop?\u201d</p><p>He breathed heavily, looking into your eyes. \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t want this to end yet.\u201d \u00a0He flipped the two of you over with ease as\nyou now straddled him; his cock still buried in your core. \u00a0</p><p>Chris rested his hands at your hips, waiting for you to make\na move. \u00a0You began to slowly gyrate your\nhips in a circle as his hands roamed up and down your thighs. \u00a0Everything about this moment was perfect, and\nlike Chris, you didn\u2019t want it to end.</p><p>Placing your hands on his chest, you began to bounce up on\ndown on his shaft as you watched Chris\u2019 face contort into pure pleasure. \u00a0\u201cYes, just like that baby,\u201d Chris said; the\nendearment making you squeeze around him. \n</p><p>He put his hands on your hips, helping you move as you felt\nyour second orgasm of the night begin to build. \nChris placed one of his thumbs at your clit, pressing down and circling\ncausing you to instantly orgasm. \u00a0Your\nwalls began to spasm around his cock, your body stilling as you felt him thrust\nup a few more times before stilling himself as you felt him release his seed\ninside of you. \u00a0</p><p>\n\nYou collapsed onto him as he gently pulled out\nof you. \u00a0He rolled you over as you felt\nhim get up from the bed, only to come back with a wet cloth and clean you\nup. \u00a0The last thing you saw before sleep\ntook you over, was Chris getting into bed right behind you. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYj9iQjNoizyFtnPtt8bOpQ\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a></p></p>",

the sexual tension was thick in the room. </p><p>You saw Chris rake his eyes down your body and onto your\nbare legs; he licked his lips at the sight of you. &nbsp;It was confusing because even though he\nkissed you on the cheek back in the day, and you lost your virginity to him, he\nnever once made a move on you; you never knew how he truly felt about you.</p><p>The way his eyes were taking in your body made you flush\nunder his gaze; and want him even more. \nYou pressed your thighs together as you stood in front of him, needing\nthat friction and you felt the dampness in your underwear. &nbsp;<i>What\nthe fuck is this man doing to me </i>you thought to yourself. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris stepped even closer to you, a small smile appearing on\nhis lips as he saw you clench your thighs together. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jess, I came over here to..&rdquo; he began to say\nbut you cut him off. </p><p>Throwing your arms around his neck, you pulled him down to\nyour lips for a searing kiss; Chris nearly losing his balance. &nbsp;Fortunately he recovered as he pulled you\ncloser to him. &nbsp;You tilted your head,\nwanting to deepen the kiss as you felt his tongue on your lips. &nbsp;Just like the first time the two of you\nkissed, you parted your lips for him and moaned when you felt his tongue on\nyours. &nbsp;It was heaven all over again as\nyour hand fisted in his hair, pulling his face even closer. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris&rsquo; right hand trailed down your back until he reached\nyour lower back, pulling you closer to him. \nYou instantly felt the hardness in his jeans and it turned you on\nknowing you had this effect on him. \n&ldquo;Does this mean I&rsquo;m forgiven?&rdquo; he asked between kisses. &nbsp;</p><p>You pulled him away by his hair, staring straight into his\neyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still fucking mad at you,&rdquo;\nyou declared before attaching your lips right back to his. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris reached down and gripped the back of your thighs\ncausing you to jump as he pulled you up. \nYou wrapped your legs around his lean waist, holding you close to him as\nthe two of you explored each other&rsquo;s mouths like you did on the night of\nprom. &nbsp;This time you weren&rsquo;t as\ninexperienced however. &nbsp;This time felt\neven more magical than the first. &nbsp;</p><p>You ground your hips closer to him, causing him to moan into\nyour mouth at the feeling. &nbsp;Chris began\nwalking the two of you through the house and up the stairs; banging against\nwalls every now and then as the two of you laughed before going back to\nkissing. &nbsp;</p><p>It was a rush, being like this with Chris. &nbsp;Not because he was a celebrity; hell, you\nnever thought of him that way. &nbsp;But\nbecause this was Chris in general, the man who you grew up with; the man you\nended up falling in love with. &nbsp;</p><p>Once he got to your bedroom, he dropped you on the bed. &nbsp;He stood towering above you; both of your\nchests heaving and lips full from kissing. \nHe gripped his t-shirt in his hands and pulled it over his head. &nbsp;Your mouth parted at the sight of his upper\nform naked in front of you. &nbsp;He was built,\nlike a damn Grecian God. &nbsp;Your eyes\ntraveled down to his happy trail, disappearing into his jeans; your mouth began\nto water. &nbsp;</p><p>You moved up the bed so your head was on your pillows as\nChris came crawling up your body, making you shiver in anticipation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Tell me to stop and I will,&rdquo; he husked out\nas his lips connected with your neck. &nbsp;A\ngasp left your throat as his tongue teased your sweet spot. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You better not fucking stop,&rdquo; you whimpered. &nbsp;</p><p>His hand trailed south from your stomach to your legs, which\nyou parted eagerly for him. &nbsp;His lips\nnever left your neck as he teased your wet folds through your underwear. &nbsp;&ldquo;Chris,&rdquo; you cried out for him, wanting his\ntouch. &nbsp;</p><p>He chuckled into your neck before dipping his fingers into\nyour panties; an animalistic groan leaving his throat at the feeling of your\nwetness. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck Jess,&rdquo; he growled as he\nripped your panties down your legs. &nbsp;You\nhelped to kick them off, then opened yourself back up for him; a needing so\ngreat you had never experienced before. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris teased your folds back and forth, spreading your\nwetness around and up to your aching clit as you cried out in pleasure. &nbsp;You gripped onto the back of his neck as he\nsunk a finger into your core. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; you\ncried out as your hips began to move. &nbsp;</p><p>It had been way too long since someone had touched you this\nway. &nbsp;It had been nothing but your own\nfingers or magic wand, but it didn&rsquo;t compare to what Chris was doing to you\nright now. &nbsp;</p><p>He added a second finger into your tight channel, spreading\nyou open as his thumb circled your clit with such expertise. &nbsp;It was one thing to orgasm at your own hands,\nbut when someone else brought you to an orgasm, it was a million times\nbetter. &nbsp;With Chris&rsquo; magic fingers and\nhis mouth at your throat, you felt your high begin to build as your moans\nechoed throughout the room. &nbsp;Your grip on\nhis neck got tighter as you pulled his face to your lips, ravishing them with\nyour own. &nbsp;</p><p>Your body began to tingle, your legs beginning to grow stiff\nas you felt your orgasm burst through you like a current. &nbsp;Chris&rsquo; fingers still working inside of you,\nprolonging your orgasm into nothing you had ever experienced before. &nbsp;</p><p>As you came down from your high, Chris slowly removed his\nfingers from you and you whined in protest of feeling empty. &nbsp;Chris chuckled lightly as he got up from the\nbed and removed his pants. &nbsp;With hazy\neyes, you turned to look at him. &nbsp;It had\nbeen a long time ago since prom, but you didn&rsquo;t remember him being THAT\nendowed. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you still want this Jessica?&rdquo; Chris urged. &nbsp;You licked your lips and nodded your head at\nhim. &nbsp;He moved to position himself over\nyou before cursing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have any protection.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled up at him, loving how protective he was being, no\npun intended. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m clean and on birth\ncontrol.&rdquo;</p><p>Chris gave you a lop sided grin, one of your favorite types\nof smiles on him. &nbsp;He hovered above you,\nresting on his left arm as he used his right hand to line himself up. &nbsp;You felt him at your entrance as you willed\nyourself to relax. &nbsp;He began to push in\nslowly as you bit down on your lip. &nbsp;It\nwas a bit uncomfortable at first as it had been a long time for you, but the\nmore you relaxed, the more pleasurable it felt. \n</p><p>He stilled once he was fully sheathed inside of you; his\nhead bowing down to rest between your head and shoulders. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shit you are fucking tight,&rdquo; he rasped out;\nhis heated breath fanning your warm skin. \n</p><p>Your eyes locked with his and you nodded your head, letting\nhim know you were ready. &nbsp;He slowly began\nto move his hips; his cock pulling out of you before gradually pushing in\nagain. &nbsp;It felt euphoric to feel this\nfull; your eyes rolling back into your head at his slow movements. &nbsp;Your inner walls twitched against his\nfullness involuntarily causing Chris to groan in pleasure. &nbsp;</p><p>Placing your feet on the bed, you began to move your hips\nupwards, letting him know you wanted more and he happily obliged. &nbsp;He set a steady rhythm at first, before\nbeginning to pound into you. &nbsp;His cock\nwas thick, filling you up with each thrust and you never wanted it to end. &nbsp;</p><p>You felt your walls begin to tighten right as Chris stopped\nhis movement. &nbsp;&ldquo;What,&rdquo; you gasped out,\n&ldquo;why did you stop?&rdquo;</p><p>He breathed heavily, looking into your eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want this to end yet.&rdquo; &nbsp;He flipped the two of you over with ease as\nyou now straddled him; his cock still buried in your core. &nbsp;</p><p>Chris rested his hands at your hips, waiting for you to make\na move. &nbsp;You began to slowly gyrate your\nhips in a circle as his hands roamed up and down your thighs. &nbsp;Everything about this moment was perfect, and\nlike Chris, you didn&rsquo;t want it to end.</p><p>Placing your hands on his chest, you began to bounce up on\ndown on his shaft as you watched Chris&rsquo; face contort into pure pleasure. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, just like that baby,&rdquo; Chris said; the\nendearment making you squeeze around him. \n</p><p>He put his hands on your hips, helping you move as you felt\nyour second orgasm of the night begin to build. \nChris placed one of his thumbs at your clit, pressing down and circling\ncausing you to instantly orgasm. &nbsp;Your\nwalls began to spasm around his cock, your body stilling as you felt him thrust\nup a few more times before stilling himself as you felt him release his seed\ninside of you. &nbsp;</p><p>\n\nYou collapsed onto him as he gently pulled out\nof you. &nbsp;He rolled you over as you felt\nhim get up from the bed, only to come back with a wet cloth and clean you\nup. &nbsp;The last thing you saw before sleep\ntook you over, was Chris getting into bed right behind you. \n\n\n\n</p><p>Tag List: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFZLgH1Zo9er5MzyXXohQBA\">@chrisevansfanfic</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-PbYdDc36pCNDKtqt2H32A\">@jinoraskies</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvx92Ca0bmTX9IHcJIKCwOQ\">@patzammit</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYVvyPBlJuKY24WaTnPPnhQ\">@zohoffman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maRk-wkBYlRixBAo8hWCkjg\">@brastrangled</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGv8r6fJX_2qORMc07jo2VQ\">@miss-cap21</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mYj9iQjNoizyFtnPtt8bOpQ\">@princess-evans-addict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUq3sPk9lcgG_jXUp6RsRIQ\">@remember-that-one-blog</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/moH2485CD_OzLSWhAudQMjA\">@the-real-kellymonster</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLEN1bSPv7F2jO2qK-XqfvQ\">@white-chocolate-mocha-fan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m-B6U87jynWLd9naB5G_dEw\">@pumbibaby</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mc2Kb_Y38BjoHk-FIWY7Rlg\">@guera31</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcRxn7YLseanjYhB44PCesg\">@kanupps06</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhvcg66HgRTM7-gI4qWvFvQ\">@libbitinasdeath</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfGDFCWQwdHP6h2bfQLKLqA\">@hispeculiartreasure</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9gP0gKLqbIcrjDz0T37bBg\">@sincerelyfan</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0E2wFcz7-jjpygcaO4nuSw\">@projectxhappiness</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvRHJPQOLxmyZlKUa6rlO2A\">@sfreeborn</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpmGAEwKsOKtyIgI-c5Ttqg\">@jjlevin</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mq3cy1j5dCpdq9OpT4x3Ukw\">@badassbaker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5QSam4Ife2TKINrNYibWHA\">@sophiealiice</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mXFYeI57g9SMd7qt-SB_oAg\">@poerebel</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mmToUcLU1n388gzQ38anXog\">@esoltis280</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mvoHONrlb9zzqCPyqVY9YZA\">@crushed-pink-petals</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfBS0BI2T_apEQcN2Elg4vg\">@mrs-captain-evans</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mifWDZ6NIu_ob1sV8Fw0dWQ\">@laochbaineann</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbMjLzeZOiw097UfkLMIxIw\">@coffeebooksandfandom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mV2FDfgOpiaeJEe0xjyXJlg\">@joannie95</a></p></p>",

I also linked the song where you guys should start listening to really immerse yourself in the storyline. Get ready for the fluff of your life.<br/></p><p><b>Summary:</b> High profile cases always got transferred to SHIELD. You show up to the transfer, dreading every second of it. Things start to turn around when Steve Rogers steps out from the shadows. You always revered as Captain America, but you guys might have more in common than you thought.</p><p><b>Warning:</b> SMUT &amp; FLUFF</p><p><b>Word Count: </b>3.8K (oh and I also wrote a lot\u2026)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"279\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pleasingpics:6STxS1vJyRoS8qYrc0kfcw:Zjf9mv2iX0-KH\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d94b1d62ac604d80b51d552a202087ca/tumblr_pqxglyb5c81rrugpso1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"279\"/></figure><p>You scanned the scene again. The scent of iron lingered around from the blood splatters on the red brick walls, but you forgot that it was there now. The sky above was shrouded in darkness, but the tall, bright skyscrapers that towered above shined enough light in the alleyway.<br/></p><p>\u201c<b>Agent Y/L/N</b>,\u201d a familiar name called from behind.</p><p>You got up from the floor and looked at your colleague who was walking towards you. Immediately, your eyes moved to the extra cup of coffee in his hands. You eyed the coffee and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is for me because I\u2019m taking over for the rest of the night. You need to go home and rest for once,\u201d he said.</p><p>You glanced at the watch on your wrist. You started the day on the scene at 7am and it was almost 11pm now. It was hard keeping track of time on the scene, but you loved that part of your job, too.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d you started to say when he placed the cups down on the floor and placed his hand over his ears.</p><p><b>\u201cI can\u2019t hear anything!\u201d</b></p><p>You rolled your eyes. This was his signature move that you knew so well.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Then, he magically displaced his hands as if he could hear everything, to begin with. You smiled and waved goodbye and he called your name again.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you are going to hate this. But, we have a SHIELD agent waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>You groaned instinctively and heard Ben laugh in the distance. Since you joined the FBI, you encountered everything you trained for in the first few years. But, things started changing fast. One random day later, you were dealing with cases that you\u2019ve never encountered before. Alien body cleanup, superhuman strength beings, and laser shooting reptiles. You were always told to pursue a case until the SHIELD hand-off. <b>That has always been the policy.</b></p><!-- more --><p>The most upsetting part of the SHIELD cases was that those were the most interesting ones. Most days you were dealing with homicides and healthcare fraud cases, but once in a while, you would get cases like this one today. The kind that made you want to show up at 7 am and work on all day. But, of course. It was hand-off time again.</p><p>You walked out of the alleyway and there was a tall figure standing by the lamp post. Unlike most SHIELD agents you encountered in the past, he wasn\u2019t dressed in the familiar uniform. He was wearing slim fit jeans and a brown leather jacket. When you got within five feet from him, he turned around. You stopped mid-tracks because you knew this face.</p><p>\u201cAgent,\u201d he said, walking towards you with his voice submerging deep into the night.</p><p><i>\u201cCap\u2026captain?\u201d</i></p><p>Captain America was standing in front of you. Confused, you looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby and saw nothing. It was just another street scene in New York. <i><b>Did he just walk over here by himself?</b></i></p><p>\u201cCall me Steve,\u201d he said casually and politely smiling.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, agent Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded. It was strange hearing your name come from him, but you also realized it was time for the file exchange. Due to the privacy and confidentiality of the files, all file sharing was done with the Stark Industries issued watch device that all the FBI, CIA, and SHIELD agents were required to have on. These watches were also programmed to clear memory once it stopped tracking your heartbeat and brain activity.</p><p>You reached out your right arm with the watch to Steve. He glanced over at you. \u201cAh, familiar with the routine.\u201d</p><p>At this point, you would be shouting all the profanities you could think of for unnecessarily wasting your time, but you <b><i>revered</i></b> Captain America. He fought to save the city. No, <b>the world</b>.</p><p>You coughed to clear your throat. \u201cAre you going to scan?\u201d You hinted politely and watched as he took out his transfer initiating tool with the SHIELD logo printed on it. He moved the device over your watch and paused. You eagerly eyed for him to press the green transfer button, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUm Y/N,\u201d he hesitated. \u201cCan I buy you a drink after this?\u201d</p><p>Confused and startled by his question, you slightly tilted your head as a natural reflex of your habit. He smiled again, this time showing his perfect teeth back at you.</p><p>You realized that it was Saturday night and your only plans were to go back to the apartment and treat yourself to a glass of wine and some leftover dinner from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cAre you buying?\u201d You replied playfully and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Then, he initiated the transfer and within seconds, your hard worked files were delivered to the SHIELD operation center. You felt a small buzz around the wrist notifying you that the process was completed successfully.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said and you followed him.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>After a few blocks of walking and making small talk about his day and yours, Steve stopped in front of a small bar. There was a neon sign that read \u201cMarley\u2019s\u201d and the streets were empty. It felt like a ghost town.</p><p>You were about to head in when Steve stopped you in place. His hand was gripped around your upper arm. You turned around and saw that he was pointing at your chest area. At first glance, it was completely inappropriate for him to be pointing at your chest, but seconds after you realized that he was pointing at your FBI jacket.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d You said as you quickly took it off and tucked it into your arms.</p><p>He let his grip free and walked in front of you to open the door. You thanked him and walked inside the bar to a large crowd of people that was 180-degree contrast from the empty streets outside. Music played from the speakers at a moderate volume so you could still hear everyone talking.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Steve spoke leaning into my ears. You followed him to an empty spot at the bar and we both got settled. He waved the bartender over and handed him his card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a glass of whiskey on the rocks and Y/N?\u201d He turned to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having,\u201d you replied looking at the bartender. He nodded and went to make the drinks. You felt Steve\u2019s stare as he opened his lips to make a comment.</p><p>\u201c<i>Whiskey</i>?\u201d He hinted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can still walk you home.\u201d You answered as you took a hair tie from your wrist and tied your hair up in a bun. The body heat in the small space was starting to slowly creep up on you.</p><p>The glasses of whiskey came out and the bartender handed Steve his card back.</p><p>\u201cKeep the tab open,\u201d Steve said as he grabbed the card. \u201cShe\u2019s just getting started.\u201d</p><p>You shot him a playful glare and he laughed. He raised his glass to you and you met him with yours. The whiskey felt refreshing going down your system and naturally, your face cringed at the first taste of the strong alcohol. This was a set up from the red wine at home.</p><p>Steve shook his head with the smile glued to his face. \u201cI\u2019m still going to need you to walk me home.\u201d</p><p>You felt your face heating up as you nudged him. You took another sip, this time being 100% aware of your expressions.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Bureau?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSeven years,\u201d you replied. \u201cI joined as a field agent as soon as I finished school.\u201d It was crazy how you were sitting in a bar, drinking, and casually talking to Captain America.</p><p>\u201cSo, you knew exactly what you wanted to do\u2026 do you have any regrets?\u201d He asked and you thought about the question for a while. Sure, you had regrets. <i>Who doesn\u2019t?</i> You were the most jealous of all of your friends who were married and starting a family of their own. You were still battling one night stands and a reasonable work-life balance.</p><p>\u201cNot being able to start a family,\u201d you answered truthfully and Steve\u2019s face turned concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I still wouldn\u2019t trade my job for that. Not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in deep thought. I knew a little about his story, but I knew that he was frozen in ice and come back to a world he no longer knew anymore.</p><p>\u201cSorry, about the downer comment.\u201d You said and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. Sorry, if I spaced out for a second.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him encouragingly and he down the rest of the whiskey. The bartender was by our side quickly and Steve put in another order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try and find a bathroom, don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He said, leaning in again. You nodded and he disappeared into the crowd. You finished your drink too and the bartender came back with two whiskeys on the rocks. As soon as he set the new glasses on the table, you felt a heavy hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d You started to say as you turned your head towards the figure. To your surprise, it wasn\u2019t Steve. There was an unfamiliar, tall and muscular man with a large beard standing next to you. You immediately got up from the seat, shaking his hand off your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, missy. Can I get you a drink?\u201d He said with a smile. Even standing, he was at least a head taller than you.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d You respectfully declined. He took a step closer, leaning against the bar ledge.</p><p>\u201cCome on, a pretty lady like you needs something prettier than whiskey on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>You already had it with him. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d You said glaring back at him who was clearly looking around uncomfortably now. The people in close proximity started stealing glances to you.</p><p>Then, his hand grabbed on to your wrist again. His grip was firmer and that quickly caught you off guard. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t really asking,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You sighed as you quickly grabbed his hand over your wrist and easily maneuvered yourself out of his grip. It was Self Defense 101. He stumbled backward and his body collided with people behind him. More eyes around the room turned to you now. You had to de-escalate before things got worse for him. You grabbed the jacket on the table and turned away from him. Before you could take another step, a heavy thud landed on your shoulder.</p><p><i><b>Okay, no.</b></i><br/></p><p>\u201cFB-\u201c You started to say when a figure jumped in between you and him.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Steve chimed in as he removed the hand from my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d The voice asked.</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d Steve answered calmly without hesitation.</p><p>You stared at Steve confusingly trying to understand what cards he was looking to play. The guy took a step back. After a long glare at you, he turned away.</p><p>\u201cSteve-\u201c You started to say and he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cHey honey, why don\u2019t we step out?\u201d</p><p>Once outside, Steve asked you to lead the way to your house. You walked side by side with him in mostly silence until he cleared his throat.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</i></p><p>You stopped and turned to look at him. He stopped as well. \u201cI appreciate the help, but I could have taken care of him by myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows narrowed at you. \u201c<i>By arresting the guy? Beating him up</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe<b> deserved </b>it,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>Steve stepped closer to you, closing the gap between. \u201cI agree, and wanted to throw a punch across his face too.\u201d You watched as his hand curled up to a tight fist. His strong jawline was prominent underneath the street lamp. Then, it quickly relaxed. \u201cBut, if you can avoid conflict, you need to. Even if the guy is a piece of garbage like him.\u201d</p><p>You knew that he was right and you hated him for it. Being short tempered definitely made the job harder than it had to be, but compared to the rookie days, you learned a lot of patience from it. Nothing did the job like a 4-hour report write up after spending 12 hours on the crime scene. You tore your eyes from Steve and continued to walk. You heard his footsteps follow behind.</p><p>When you finally arrived in front of your apartment building you looked back at Steve. Out of your many flaws, being stubborn was your greatest one. Sure, it had benefits like always getting what you wanted, but you were always the last to apologize. After a quick exhales, you bit your tongue and blurted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve replied, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cI have\u2026 mild anger issues and I let that out on you,\u201d you confessed.</p><p>A second later, he started to laugh. You stared back with a blank face. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d He managed in between his laughs. \u201cThank you for your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d You asked and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe whole time I was walking behind you\u2026 I was thinking about how upset you were at me now when all I wanted was to grab a drink with you because you looked so beautiful in your uniform back there. It was just unexpected.\u201d</p><p>You felt your cheek warm up and your tense energy <g class=\"gr_ gr_507 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"507\" data-gr-id=\"507\">drain</g> from you. Steve\u2019s smile was contagious and a smile crept up on your face too.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in to finish that drink?\u201d You asked and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>As you unlocked the front door, your mind went wild with all the chores you put off. Unwashed dishes in the sink and loads of laundry on the floor, the moment you opened the door you looked back at Steve.</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay right here for a second.\u201d</p><p>You ran through the living room straight to the bedroom and raked all the clothes on the floor underneath the bed. Midway clothes raking you realized that you were cleaning the bedroom as if Steve was going to come here. You dropped everything and peeked at the front doorway and didn\u2019t see Steve standing there as you ordered.</p><p>Panicking, you walked through the hallway and saw Steve sitting on the couch in the living room. He took off his leather jacket and was wearing a tight-fitting white t-shirt now. Tearing your eyes from him perfectly built body, your eyes scanned every corner to see if anything was out of place. Minus the random books and magazines scattered around the space, you didn\u2019t see\u2026 <b><i>oh shit</i></b>.</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_513 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"513\" data-gr-id=\"513\">Next</g> to the seat where Steve was sitting, your eyes focused on the red lace underwear that was stuck in the crease between the back cushion and seat cushion. <i><b>How</b> did that even get there?</i> You walked over to Steve casually as if there was nothing wrong in the world and sat right next to him.</p><p>\u201cThe couch looked more comfortable than standing,\u201d Steve said. You didn\u2019t realize how crystal blue his eyes were.</p><p>\u201cAnd I took you for a rule follower,\u201d you said as you reached a hand behind you to grab the lingerie without him noticing. After awkwardly adjusting yourself a few times, the soft fabric touched your palm and you held on to it for dear life. <b>Operation Underwear was a success.</b></p><p>\u201cIs your arm okay?\u201d Steve asked, looking concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t really look comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this\u2026 is\u2026 uh actually my usual stretch after work,\u201d you said with a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cHere, I can help you stretch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m-\u201c \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>(Play <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqxIjfFmV-pk&amp;t=NGQxNjM1OGQzNDczZjE0ODc0NDUwMGQ3YjAzNjExOTQ3ZmM3MTFkMixrSWpjeTEzTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AAjgURzGrP8JanXxNI8OW6A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fluniellar.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F185826947373%2Fencounter-steve-rogers-x-reader-one-shot&amp;m=1\">this</a> for some music)</i></p><p>He leaned in closer for your arm and you met him midway to stop him. Time stopped as you felt his soft, warm breath brush against your cheeks. His baby blue eyes stared into yours, piercing through you. You felt transparent like he could see through you. Maybe he could see how badly I was tempted to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m ok-\u201d</p><p>Before you could finish your sentence, you watched as his gaze switched from your eyes to your lips. Then, his lips collided with yours. When your lips found him, his lips slowly opened yours for his tongue and it was like fire meeting gas. You quickly stuffed the fabric in your hand deeper into the couch and used the new free hand to caress his face. He held on to the side of your neck as you devoured each other.</p><p>When you pulled away, you were desperately trying to catch your breath. Steve rested his forehead on your shoulder as he was breathing irregularly as well. It was hard to stop yourself from ripping the t-shirt off him as you were staring directly at his shirt stretched over his shoulder and chest muscles. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you started.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was-,\u201d he replied in between his breaths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need you to look at me before I rip that shirt off you.\u201d You blurted out shamelessly. He lifted his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you say rip my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d you whispered as you climbed into his lap. His body was warm like a towel fresh out of the dryer against yours. He grabbed your hair that was in a messy bun and pulled the hair tie from it. You giggled as your hair dropped all over your face. He pushed the hair aside and caressed your face. The way he held your face was different from all the other guys who held you before. <b>You felt safe and sheltered with him.</b></p><p>He moved his hand down on to your shirt collar. Starting from the top, he slowly unbuttoned the buttons one by one. When he reached the button at your cleavage, he looked up for your approval. You placed your hands over his and helped him unbutton the rest. When he reached the last one, you stripped off the white shirt and threw it on the floor. You eyed his shirt and he followed. In one fluid motion, he pulled the shirt off him and threw it in the same pile as yours.</p><p>In the light, your scars from training and work were apparent. Without a word, he traced your skin with his finger. He ran over the long scar between my chest and shoulder, the bullet wound from the bullet that grazed your waist, and many more. His eyes calmly followed each scar. You saw the scars on his porcelain skin too, but you didn\u2019t want to interrupt.</p><p>\u201c<i>How much did it hurt</i>?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet wound was a pain to recover from, but for the most of them I didn\u2019t even know I was hurt until after.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to meet your eyes. His face clearly told you that he was upset about something. He touched a scar close to where your heart was racing. \u201cHow am I supposed to be okay with you showing up to work every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know the answer to that, Steve.\u201d You smiled at his protectiveness. It was definitely a major turn-on. \u201c<i><b>We both love what we do</b></i>.\u201d</p><p>You moved his hand and softly kissed a faint scar on his chest. When you pulled away, his lips awaited yours. This kiss was gentle, timid, and sweet.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFrom now, I want you to share your pain with me.\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a smile. He reached his arms around your legs and you wrapped your arms around his neck. He stood effortlessly from the couch, supporting you in his arms. You kissed as he walked down the hallway and into the bedroom. Pulling away from the kiss, he gently placed you on the bed and pulled off your pants.</p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the first time I\u2019m having sleeping with someone on the first date,\u201d he said as he dropped his pants on the floor.</p><p>You rolled your eyes at him. \u201cJust shut up and just do me already.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Ugh.</b></p><p>Your body naturally woke up at 6 am. You opened your eyes to the sound of birds chirping outside. From the window, you saw the pale yellow sky that signaled the sun was coming up. You tried to reach for your phone on the end table, but your body felt sore all over. <i>Yes, including the space between your legs that will not be mentioned</i><b>.</b> You tried to toss around the queen-sized bed but felt something, no <b>someone</b> behind your back. Keeping the blankets wrapped around your naked body, you inched your body little by little until you were facing his peaceful, sleeping face.</p><p>It was a strange feeling waking up next to another person. Most of your relationships, if you can even call it that, were one night stands and this was welcomed change. For minutes, you held your breath and admired Steve\u2019s long eyelashes up close. They had to be longer than yours.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he whispered, making you jump.</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and his brilliant blue eyes greeted you. \u201cI\u2019m a light sleeper.\u201d His eyes were all that you needed to start <g class=\"gr_ gr_543 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"543\" data-gr-id=\"543\">craving</g> him again. \u201cOh no, I remember that look from last night.\u201d</p><p>You smiled as you pressed your bare body against his bare body. <i>Oh, and that\u2019s the morning wood.</i> You grinned harder and he buried his face into your neck in shyness. When he pulled away, your phone went off. Keeping the covers on you, you reached your sore body and grabbed the phone. It was a text from Ben. You had to go. When you glanced back, Steve was already putting on his underwear.</p><p>\u201cLet me make you something before you go,\u201d he said, getting up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you agreed. Before he stepped out of the bedroom, you called his name again. \u201cAm I going to see you tonight?\u201d It was weird asking for a second date. It was a strange mix of anticipation and fear. Was this what it felt like to be committed to someone?\u00a0</p><p>He looked funny smiling by the doorway only in his boxer briefs. Then, he walked over to you and kissed your forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until you get sick of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, by the way,\u201d you whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t planning to leave even if you asked.\u201d</p><p>We both smiled at each other anticipating our new forever.</p><p>_____<i>&lsquo;Cause when you love someone<br/>You open up your heart<br/>When you love someone<br/>You make room<br/>If you love someone<br/>And you&rsquo;re not afraid to lose 'em<br/>You&rsquo;ll probably never love someone like I do<br/>You&rsquo;ll probably never love someone like I do</i>__<b>Love Someone - Lukas Graham</b></p>",

One random day later, you were dealing with cases that you\u2019ve never encountered before. Alien body cleanup, superhuman strength beings, and laser shooting reptiles. You were always told to pursue a case until the SHIELD hand-off. <b>That has always been the policy.</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>The most upsetting part of the SHIELD cases was that those were the most interesting ones. Most days you were dealing with homicides and healthcare fraud cases, but once in a while, you would get cases like this one today. The kind that made you want to show up at 7 am and work on all day. But, of course. It was hand-off time again.</p><p>You walked out of the alleyway and there was a tall figure standing by the lamp post. Unlike most SHIELD agents you encountered in the past, he wasn\u2019t dressed in the familiar uniform. He was wearing slim fit jeans and a brown leather jacket. When you got within five feet from him, he turned around. You stopped mid-tracks because you knew this face.</p><p>\u201cAgent,\u201d he said, walking towards you with his voice submerging deep into the night.</p><p><i>\u201cCap\u2026captain?\u201d</i></p><p>Captain America was standing in front of you. Confused, you looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby and saw nothing. It was just another street scene in New York. <i><b>Did he just walk over here by himself?</b></i></p><p>\u201cCall me Steve,\u201d he said casually and politely smiling.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, agent Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded. It was strange hearing your name come from him, but you also realized it was time for the file exchange. Due to the privacy and confidentiality of the files, all file sharing was done with the Stark Industries issued watch device that all the FBI, CIA, and SHIELD agents were required to have on. These watches were also programmed to clear memory once it stopped tracking your heartbeat and brain activity.</p><p>You reached out your right arm with the watch to Steve. He glanced over at you. \u201cAh, familiar with the routine.\u201d</p><p>At this point, you would be shouting all the profanities you could think of for unnecessarily wasting your time, but you <b><i>revered</i></b> Captain America. He fought to save the city. No, <b>the world</b>.</p><p>You coughed to clear your throat. \u201cAre you going to scan?\u201d You hinted politely and watched as he took out his transfer initiating tool with the SHIELD logo printed on it. He moved the device over your watch and paused. You eagerly eyed for him to press the green transfer button, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUm Y/N,\u201d he hesitated. \u201cCan I buy you a drink after this?\u201d</p><p>Confused and startled by his question, you slightly tilted your head as a natural reflex of your habit. He smiled again, this time showing his perfect teeth back at you.</p><p>You realized that it was Saturday night and your only plans were to go back to the apartment and treat yourself to a glass of wine and some leftover dinner from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cAre you buying?\u201d You replied playfully and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Then, he initiated the transfer and within seconds, your hard worked files were delivered to the SHIELD operation center. You felt a small buzz around the wrist notifying you that the process was completed successfully.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said and you followed him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>After a few blocks of walking and making small talk about his day and yours, Steve stopped in front of a small bar. There was a neon sign that read \u201cMarley\u2019s\u201d and the streets were empty. It felt like a ghost town.</p><p>You were about to head in when Steve stopped you in place. His hand was gripped around your upper arm. You turned around and saw that he was pointing at your chest area. At first glance, it was completely inappropriate for him to be pointing at your chest, but seconds after you realized that he was pointing at your FBI jacket.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d You said as you quickly took it off and tucked it into your arms.</p><p>He let his grip free and walked in front of you to open the door. You thanked him and walked inside the bar to a large crowd of people that was 180-degree contrast from the empty streets outside. Music played from the speakers at a moderate volume so you could still hear everyone talking.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Steve spoke leaning into my ears. You followed him to an empty spot at the bar and we both got settled. He waved the bartender over and handed him his card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a glass of whiskey on the rocks and Y/N?\u201d He turned to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having,\u201d you replied looking at the bartender. He nodded and went to make the drinks. You felt Steve\u2019s stare as he opened his lips to make a comment.</p><p>\u201c<i>Whiskey</i>?\u201d He hinted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can still walk you home.\u201d You answered as you took a hair tie from your wrist and tied your hair up in a bun. The body heat in the small space was starting to slowly creep up on you.</p><p>The glasses of whiskey came out and the bartender handed Steve his card back.</p><p>\u201cKeep the tab open,\u201d Steve said as he grabbed the card. \u201cShe\u2019s just getting started.\u201d</p><p>You shot him a playful glare and he laughed. He raised his glass to you and you met him with yours. The whiskey felt refreshing going down your system and naturally, your face cringed at the first taste of the strong alcohol. This was a set up from the red wine at home.</p><p>Steve shook his head with the smile glued to his face. \u201cI\u2019m still going to need you to walk me home.\u201d</p><p>You felt your face heating up as you nudged him. You took another sip, this time being 100% aware of your expressions.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Bureau?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSeven years,\u201d you replied. \u201cI joined as a field agent as soon as I finished school.\u201d It was crazy how you were sitting in a bar, drinking, and casually talking to Captain America.</p><p>\u201cSo, you knew exactly what you wanted to do\u2026 do you have any regrets?\u201d He asked and you thought about the question for a while. Sure, you had regrets. <i>Who doesn\u2019t?</i> You were the most jealous of all of your friends who were married and starting a family of their own. You were still battling one night stands and a reasonable work-life balance.</p><p>\u201cNot being able to start a family,\u201d you answered truthfully and Steve\u2019s face turned concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I still wouldn\u2019t trade my job for that. Not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in deep thought. I knew a little about his story, but I knew that he was frozen in ice and come back to a world he no longer knew anymore.</p><p>\u201cSorry, about the downer comment.\u201d You said and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. Sorry, if I spaced out for a second.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him encouragingly and he down the rest of the whiskey. The bartender was by our side quickly and Steve put in another order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try and find a bathroom, don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He said, leaning in again. You nodded and he disappeared into the crowd. You finished your drink too and the bartender came back with two whiskeys on the rocks. As soon as he set the new glasses on the table, you felt a heavy hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d You started to say as you turned your head towards the figure. To your surprise, it wasn\u2019t Steve. There was an unfamiliar, tall and muscular man with a large beard standing next to you. You immediately got up from the seat, shaking his hand off your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, missy. Can I get you a drink?\u201d He said with a smile. Even standing, he was at least a head taller than you.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d You respectfully declined. He took a step closer, leaning against the bar ledge.</p><p>\u201cCome on, a pretty lady like you needs something prettier than whiskey on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>You already had it with him. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d You said glaring back at him who was clearly looking around uncomfortably now. The people in close proximity started stealing glances to you.</p><p>Then, his hand grabbed on to your wrist again. His grip was firmer and that quickly caught you off guard. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t really asking,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You sighed as you quickly grabbed his hand over your wrist and easily maneuvered yourself out of his grip. It was Self Defense 101. He stumbled backward and his body collided with people behind him. More eyes around the room turned to you now. You had to de-escalate before things got worse for him. You grabbed the jacket on the table and turned away from him. Before you could take another step, a heavy thud landed on your shoulder.</p><p><i><b>Okay, no.</b></i><br></p><p>\u201cFB-\u201c You started to say when a figure jumped in between you and him.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Steve chimed in as he removed the hand from my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d The voice asked.</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d Steve answered calmly without hesitation.</p><p>You stared at Steve confusingly trying to understand what cards he was looking to play. The guy took a step back. After a long glare at you, he turned away.</p><p>\u201cSteve-\u201c You started to say and he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cHey honey, why don\u2019t we step out?\u201d</p><p>Once outside, Steve asked you to lead the way to your house. You walked side by side with him in mostly silence until he cleared his throat.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</i></p><p>You stopped and turned to look at him. He stopped as well. \u201cI appreciate the help, but I could have taken care of him by myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows narrowed at you. \u201c<i>By arresting the guy? Beating him up</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe<b> deserved </b>it,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>Steve stepped closer to you, closing the gap between. \u201cI agree, and wanted to throw a punch across his face too.\u201d You watched as his hand curled up to a tight fist. His strong jawline was prominent underneath the street lamp. Then, it quickly relaxed. \u201cBut, if you can avoid conflict, you need to. Even if the guy is a piece of garbage like him.\u201d</p><p>You knew that he was right and you hated him for it. Being short tempered definitely made the job harder than it had to be, but compared to the rookie days, you learned a lot of patience from it. Nothing did the job like a 4-hour report write up after spending 12 hours on the crime scene. You tore your eyes from Steve and continued to walk. You heard his footsteps follow behind.</p><p>When you finally arrived in front of your apartment building you looked back at Steve. Out of your many flaws, being stubborn was your greatest one. Sure, it had benefits like always getting what you wanted, but you were always the last to apologize. After a quick exhales, you bit your tongue and blurted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve replied, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cI have\u2026 mild anger issues and I let that out on you,\u201d you confessed.</p><p>A second later, he started to laugh. You stared back with a blank face. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d He managed in between his laughs. \u201cThank you for your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d You asked and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe whole time I was walking behind you\u2026 I was thinking about how upset you were at me now when all I wanted was to grab a drink with you because you looked so beautiful in your uniform back there. It was just unexpected.\u201d</p><p>You felt your cheek warm up and your tense energy <g class=\"gr_ gr_507 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"507\" data-gr-id=\"507\">drain</g> from you. Steve\u2019s smile was contagious and a smile crept up on your face too.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in to finish that drink?\u201d You asked and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As you unlocked the front door, your mind went wild with all the chores you put off. Unwashed dishes in the sink and loads of laundry on the floor, the moment you opened the door you looked back at Steve.</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay right here for a second.\u201d</p><p>You ran through the living room straight to the bedroom and raked all the clothes on the floor underneath the bed. Midway clothes raking you realized that you were cleaning the bedroom as if Steve was going to come here. You dropped everything and peeked at the front doorway and didn\u2019t see Steve standing there as you ordered.</p><p>Panicking, you walked through the hallway and saw Steve sitting on the couch in the living room. He took off his leather jacket and was wearing a tight-fitting white t-shirt now. Tearing your eyes from him perfectly built body, your eyes scanned every corner to see if anything was out of place. Minus the random books and magazines scattered around the space, you didn\u2019t see\u2026 <b><i>oh shit</i></b>.</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_513 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"513\" data-gr-id=\"513\">Next</g> to the seat where Steve was sitting, your eyes focused on the red lace underwear that was stuck in the crease between the back cushion and seat cushion. <i><b>How</b> did that even get there?</i> You walked over to Steve casually as if there was nothing wrong in the world and sat right next to him.</p><p>\u201cThe couch looked more comfortable than standing,\u201d Steve said. You didn\u2019t realize how crystal blue his eyes were.</p><p>\u201cAnd I took you for a rule follower,\u201d you said as you reached a hand behind you to grab the lingerie without him noticing. After awkwardly adjusting yourself a few times, the soft fabric touched your palm and you held on to it for dear life. <b>Operation Underwear was a success.</b></p><p>\u201cIs your arm okay?\u201d Steve asked, looking concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t really look comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this\u2026 is\u2026 uh actually my usual stretch after work,\u201d you said with a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cHere, I can help you stretch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m-\u201c \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>(Play <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqxIjfFmV-pk&amp;t=NGQxNjM1OGQzNDczZjE0ODc0NDUwMGQ3YjAzNjExOTQ3ZmM3MTFkMixrSWpjeTEzTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AAjgURzGrP8JanXxNI8OW6A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fluniellar.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F185826947373%2Fencounter-steve-rogers-x-reader-one-shot&amp;m=1\">this</a> for some music)</i></p><p>He leaned in closer for your arm and you met him midway to stop him. Time stopped as you felt his soft, warm breath brush against your cheeks. His baby blue eyes stared into yours, piercing through you. You felt transparent like he could see through you. Maybe he could see how badly I was tempted to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m ok-\u201d</p><p>Before you could finish your sentence, you watched as his gaze switched from your eyes to your lips. Then, his lips collided with yours. When your lips found him, his lips slowly opened yours for his tongue and it was like fire meeting gas. You quickly stuffed the fabric in your hand deeper into the couch and used the new free hand to caress his face. He held on to the side of your neck as you devoured each other.</p><p>When you pulled away, you were desperately trying to catch your breath. Steve rested his forehead on your shoulder as he was breathing irregularly as well. It was hard to stop yourself from ripping the t-shirt off him as you were staring directly at his shirt stretched over his shoulder and chest muscles. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you started.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was-,\u201d he replied in between his breaths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need you to look at me before I rip that shirt off you.\u201d You blurted out shamelessly. He lifted his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you say rip my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d you whispered as you climbed into his lap. His body was warm like a towel fresh out of the dryer against yours. He grabbed your hair that was in a messy bun and pulled the hair tie from it. You giggled as your hair dropped all over your face. He pushed the hair aside and caressed your face. The way he held your face was different from all the other guys who held you before. <b>You felt safe and sheltered with him.</b></p><p>He moved his hand down on to your shirt collar. Starting from the top, he slowly unbuttoned the buttons one by one. When he reached the button at your cleavage, he looked up for your approval. You placed your hands over his and helped him unbutton the rest. When he reached the last one, you stripped off the white shirt and threw it on the floor. You eyed his shirt and he followed. In one fluid motion, he pulled the shirt off him and threw it in the same pile as yours.</p><p>In the light, your scars from training and work were apparent. Without a word, he traced your skin with his finger. He ran over the long scar between my chest and shoulder, the bullet wound from the bullet that grazed your waist, and many more. His eyes calmly followed each scar. You saw the scars on his porcelain skin too, but you didn\u2019t want to interrupt.</p><p>\u201c<i>How much did it hurt</i>?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet wound was a pain to recover from, but for the most of them I didn\u2019t even know I was hurt until after.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to meet your eyes. His face clearly told you that he was upset about something. He touched a scar close to where your heart was racing. \u201cHow am I supposed to be okay with you showing up to work every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know the answer to that, Steve.\u201d You smiled at his protectiveness. It was definitely a major turn-on. \u201c<i><b>We both love what we do</b></i>.\u201d</p><p>You moved his hand and softly kissed a faint scar on his chest. When you pulled away, his lips awaited yours. This kiss was gentle, timid, and sweet.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFrom now, I want you to share your pain with me.\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a smile. He reached his arms around your legs and you wrapped your arms around his neck. He stood effortlessly from the couch, supporting you in his arms. You kissed as he walked down the hallway and into the bedroom. Pulling away from the kiss, he gently placed you on the bed and pulled off your pants.</p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the first time I\u2019m having sleeping with someone on the first date,\u201d he said as he dropped his pants on the floor.</p><p>You rolled your eyes at him. \u201cJust shut up and just do me already.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Ugh.</b></p><p>Your body naturally woke up at 6 am. You opened your eyes to the sound of birds chirping outside. From the window, you saw the pale yellow sky that signaled the sun was coming up. You tried to reach for your phone on the end table, but your body felt sore all over. <i>Yes, including the space between your legs that will not be mentioned</i><b>.</b> You tried to toss around the queen-sized bed but felt something, no <b>someone</b> behind your back. Keeping the blankets wrapped around your naked body, you inched your body little by little until you were facing his peaceful, sleeping face.</p><p>It was a strange feeling waking up next to another person. Most of your relationships, if you can even call it that, were one night stands and this was welcomed change. For minutes, you held your breath and admired Steve\u2019s long eyelashes up close. They had to be longer than yours.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he whispered, making you jump.</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and his brilliant blue eyes greeted you. \u201cI\u2019m a light sleeper.\u201d His eyes were all that you needed to start <g class=\"gr_ gr_543 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"543\" data-gr-id=\"543\">craving</g> him again. \u201cOh no, I remember that look from last night.\u201d</p><p>You smiled as you pressed your bare body against his bare body. <i>Oh, and that\u2019s the morning wood.</i> You grinned harder and he buried his face into your neck in shyness. When he pulled away, your phone went off. Keeping the covers on you, you reached your sore body and grabbed the phone. It was a text from Ben. You had to go. When you glanced back, Steve was already putting on his underwear.</p><p>\u201cLet me make you something before you go,\u201d he said, getting up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you agreed. Before he stepped out of the bedroom, you called his name again. \u201cAm I going to see you tonight?\u201d It was weird asking for a second date. It was a strange mix of anticipation and fear. Was this what it felt like to be committed to someone?\u00a0</p><p>He looked funny smiling by the doorway only in his boxer briefs. Then, he walked over to you and kissed your forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until you get sick of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, by the way,\u201d you whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t planning to leave even if you asked.\u201d</p><p>We both smiled at each other anticipating our new forever.</p><p>_____<i>\u2018Cause when you love someone<br>You open up your heart<br>When you love someone<br>You make room<br>If you love someone<br>And you\u2019re not afraid to lose 'em<br>You\u2019ll probably never love someone like I do<br>You\u2019ll probably never love someone like I do</i>__<b>Love Someone - Lukas Graham</b></p>",

I also linked the song where you guys should start listening to really immerse yourself in the storyline. Get ready for the fluff of your life.<br></p><p><b>Summary:</b> High profile cases always got transferred to SHIELD. You show up to the transfer, dreading every second of it. Things start to turn around when Steve Rogers steps out from the shadows. You always revered as Captain America, but you guys might have more in common than you thought.</p><p><b>Warning:</b> SMUT &amp; FLUFF</p><p><b>Word Count: </b>3.8K (oh and I also wrote a lot\u2026)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"279\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"pleasingpics:6STxS1vJyRoS8qYrc0kfcw:Zjf9mv2iX0-KH\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d94b1d62ac604d80b51d552a202087ca/tumblr_pqxglyb5c81rrugpso1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"279\"></figure><p>You scanned the scene again. The scent of iron lingered around from the blood splatters on the red brick walls, but you forgot that it was there now. The sky above was shrouded in darkness, but the tall, bright skyscrapers that towered above shined enough light in the alleyway.<br></p><p>\u201c<b>Agent Y/L/N</b>,\u201d a familiar name called from behind.</p><p>You got up from the floor and looked at your colleague who was walking towards you. Immediately, your eyes moved to the extra cup of coffee in his hands. You eyed the coffee and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is for me because I\u2019m taking over for the rest of the night. You need to go home and rest for once,\u201d he said.</p><p>You glanced at the watch on your wrist. You started the day on the scene at 7am and it was almost 11pm now. It was hard keeping track of time on the scene, but you loved that part of your job, too.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d you started to say when he placed the cups down on the floor and placed his hand over his ears.</p><p><b>\u201cI can\u2019t hear anything!\u201d</b></p><p>You rolled your eyes. This was his signature move that you knew so well.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Then, he magically displaced his hands as if he could hear everything, to begin with. You smiled and waved goodbye and he called your name again.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, you are going to hate this. But, we have a SHIELD agent waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>You groaned instinctively and heard Ben laugh in the distance. Since you joined the FBI, you encountered everything you trained for in the first few years. But, things started changing fast. One random day later, you were dealing with cases that you\u2019ve never encountered before. Alien body cleanup, superhuman strength beings, and laser shooting reptiles. You were always told to pursue a case until the SHIELD hand-off. <b>That has always been the policy.</b></p>[[MORE]]<p>The most upsetting part of the SHIELD cases was that those were the most interesting ones. Most days you were dealing with homicides and healthcare fraud cases, but once in a while, you would get cases like this one today. The kind that made you want to show up at 7 am and work on all day. But, of course. It was hand-off time again.</p><p>You walked out of the alleyway and there was a tall figure standing by the lamp post. Unlike most SHIELD agents you encountered in the past, he wasn\u2019t dressed in the familiar uniform. He was wearing slim fit jeans and a brown leather jacket. When you got within five feet from him, he turned around. You stopped mid-tracks because you knew this face.</p><p>\u201cAgent,\u201d he said, walking towards you with his voice submerging deep into the night.</p><p><i>\u201cCap\u2026captain?\u201d</i></p><p>Captain America was standing in front of you. Confused, you looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby and saw nothing. It was just another street scene in New York. <i><b>Did he just walk over here by himself?</b></i></p><p>\u201cCall me Steve,\u201d he said casually and politely smiling.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d you replied.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, agent Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded. It was strange hearing your name come from him, but you also realized it was time for the file exchange. Due to the privacy and confidentiality of the files, all file sharing was done with the Stark Industries issued watch device that all the FBI, CIA, and SHIELD agents were required to have on. These watches were also programmed to clear memory once it stopped tracking your heartbeat and brain activity.</p><p>You reached out your right arm with the watch to Steve. He glanced over at you. \u201cAh, familiar with the routine.\u201d</p><p>At this point, you would be shouting all the profanities you could think of for unnecessarily wasting your time, but you <b><i>revered</i></b> Captain America. He fought to save the city. No, <b>the world</b>.</p><p>You coughed to clear your throat. \u201cAre you going to scan?\u201d You hinted politely and watched as he took out his transfer initiating tool with the SHIELD logo printed on it. He moved the device over your watch and paused. You eagerly eyed for him to press the green transfer button, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUm Y/N,\u201d he hesitated. \u201cCan I buy you a drink after this?\u201d</p><p>Confused and startled by his question, you slightly tilted your head as a natural reflex of your habit. He smiled again, this time showing his perfect teeth back at you.</p><p>You realized that it was Saturday night and your only plans were to go back to the apartment and treat yourself to a glass of wine and some leftover dinner from yesterday.</p><p>\u201cAre you buying?\u201d You replied playfully and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Then, he initiated the transfer and within seconds, your hard worked files were delivered to the SHIELD operation center. You felt a small buzz around the wrist notifying you that the process was completed successfully.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said and you followed him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>After a few blocks of walking and making small talk about his day and yours, Steve stopped in front of a small bar. There was a neon sign that read \u201cMarley\u2019s\u201d and the streets were empty. It felt like a ghost town.</p><p>You were about to head in when Steve stopped you in place. His hand was gripped around your upper arm. You turned around and saw that he was pointing at your chest area. At first glance, it was completely inappropriate for him to be pointing at your chest, but seconds after you realized that he was pointing at your FBI jacket.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d You said as you quickly took it off and tucked it into your arms.</p><p>He let his grip free and walked in front of you to open the door. You thanked him and walked inside the bar to a large crowd of people that was 180-degree contrast from the empty streets outside. Music played from the speakers at a moderate volume so you could still hear everyone talking.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Steve spoke leaning into my ears. You followed him to an empty spot at the bar and we both got settled. He waved the bartender over and handed him his card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a glass of whiskey on the rocks and Y/N?\u201d He turned to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having,\u201d you replied looking at the bartender. He nodded and went to make the drinks. You felt Steve\u2019s stare as he opened his lips to make a comment.</p><p>\u201c<i>Whiskey</i>?\u201d He hinted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can still walk you home.\u201d You answered as you took a hair tie from your wrist and tied your hair up in a bun. The body heat in the small space was starting to slowly creep up on you.</p><p>The glasses of whiskey came out and the bartender handed Steve his card back.</p><p>\u201cKeep the tab open,\u201d Steve said as he grabbed the card. \u201cShe\u2019s just getting started.\u201d</p><p>You shot him a playful glare and he laughed. He raised his glass to you and you met him with yours. The whiskey felt refreshing going down your system and naturally, your face cringed at the first taste of the strong alcohol. This was a set up from the red wine at home.</p><p>Steve shook his head with the smile glued to his face. \u201cI\u2019m still going to need you to walk me home.\u201d</p><p>You felt your face heating up as you nudged him. You took another sip, this time being 100% aware of your expressions.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the Bureau?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cSeven years,\u201d you replied. \u201cI joined as a field agent as soon as I finished school.\u201d It was crazy how you were sitting in a bar, drinking, and casually talking to Captain America.</p><p>\u201cSo, you knew exactly what you wanted to do\u2026 do you have any regrets?\u201d He asked and you thought about the question for a while. Sure, you had regrets. <i>Who doesn\u2019t?</i> You were the most jealous of all of your friends who were married and starting a family of their own. You were still battling one night stands and a reasonable work-life balance.</p><p>\u201cNot being able to start a family,\u201d you answered truthfully and Steve\u2019s face turned concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I still wouldn\u2019t trade my job for that. Not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in deep thought. I knew a little about his story, but I knew that he was frozen in ice and come back to a world he no longer knew anymore.</p><p>\u201cSorry, about the downer comment.\u201d You said and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault. Sorry, if I spaced out for a second.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him encouragingly and he down the rest of the whiskey. The bartender was by our side quickly and Steve put in another order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try and find a bathroom, don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He said, leaning in again. You nodded and he disappeared into the crowd. You finished your drink too and the bartender came back with two whiskeys on the rocks. As soon as he set the new glasses on the table, you felt a heavy hand on your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSteve?\u201d You started to say as you turned your head towards the figure. To your surprise, it wasn\u2019t Steve. There was an unfamiliar, tall and muscular man with a large beard standing next to you. You immediately got up from the seat, shaking his hand off your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, missy. Can I get you a drink?\u201d He said with a smile. Even standing, he was at least a head taller than you.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d You respectfully declined. He took a step closer, leaning against the bar ledge.</p><p>\u201cCome on, a pretty lady like you needs something prettier than whiskey on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>You already had it with him. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d You said glaring back at him who was clearly looking around uncomfortably now. The people in close proximity started stealing glances to you.</p><p>Then, his hand grabbed on to your wrist again. His grip was firmer and that quickly caught you off guard. \u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t really asking,\u201d he replied smoothly.</p><p>You sighed as you quickly grabbed his hand over your wrist and easily maneuvered yourself out of his grip. It was Self Defense 101. He stumbled backward and his body collided with people behind him. More eyes around the room turned to you now. You had to de-escalate before things got worse for him. You grabbed the jacket on the table and turned away from him. Before you could take another step, a heavy thud landed on your shoulder.</p><p><i><b>Okay, no.</b></i><br></p><p>\u201cFB-\u201c You started to say when a figure jumped in between you and him.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Steve chimed in as he removed the hand from my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d The voice asked.</p><p>\u201cHer boyfriend,\u201d Steve answered calmly without hesitation.</p><p>You stared at Steve confusingly trying to understand what cards he was looking to play. The guy took a step back. After a long glare at you, he turned away.</p><p>\u201cSteve-\u201c You started to say and he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cHey honey, why don\u2019t we step out?\u201d</p><p>Once outside, Steve asked you to lead the way to your house. You walked side by side with him in mostly silence until he cleared his throat.</p><p><i>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</i></p><p>You stopped and turned to look at him. He stopped as well. \u201cI appreciate the help, but I could have taken care of him by myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows narrowed at you. \u201c<i>By arresting the guy? Beating him up</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe<b> deserved </b>it,\u201d you sighed.</p><p>Steve stepped closer to you, closing the gap between. \u201cI agree, and wanted to throw a punch across his face too.\u201d You watched as his hand curled up to a tight fist. His strong jawline was prominent underneath the street lamp. Then, it quickly relaxed. \u201cBut, if you can avoid conflict, you need to. Even if the guy is a piece of garbage like him.\u201d</p><p>You knew that he was right and you hated him for it. Being short tempered definitely made the job harder than it had to be, but compared to the rookie days, you learned a lot of patience from it. Nothing did the job like a 4-hour report write up after spending 12 hours on the crime scene. You tore your eyes from Steve and continued to walk. You heard his footsteps follow behind.</p><p>When you finally arrived in front of your apartment building you looked back at Steve. Out of your many flaws, being stubborn was your greatest one. Sure, it had benefits like always getting what you wanted, but you were always the last to apologize. After a quick exhales, you bit your tongue and blurted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve replied, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cI have\u2026 mild anger issues and I let that out on you,\u201d you confessed.</p><p>A second later, he started to laugh. You stared back with a blank face. \u201cSorry, sorry.\u201d He managed in between his laughs. \u201cThank you for your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d You asked and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe whole time I was walking behind you\u2026 I was thinking about how upset you were at me now when all I wanted was to grab a drink with you because you looked so beautiful in your uniform back there. It was just unexpected.\u201d</p><p>You felt your cheek warm up and your tense energy <g class=\"gr_ gr_507 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"507\" data-gr-id=\"507\">drain</g> from you. Steve\u2019s smile was contagious and a smile crept up on your face too.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in to finish that drink?\u201d You asked and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As you unlocked the front door, your mind went wild with all the chores you put off. Unwashed dishes in the sink and loads of laundry on the floor, the moment you opened the door you looked back at Steve.</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay right here for a second.\u201d</p><p>You ran through the living room straight to the bedroom and raked all the clothes on the floor underneath the bed. Midway clothes raking you realized that you were cleaning the bedroom as if Steve was going to come here. You dropped everything and peeked at the front doorway and didn\u2019t see Steve standing there as you ordered.</p><p>Panicking, you walked through the hallway and saw Steve sitting on the couch in the living room. He took off his leather jacket and was wearing a tight-fitting white t-shirt now. Tearing your eyes from him perfectly built body, your eyes scanned every corner to see if anything was out of place. Minus the random books and magazines scattered around the space, you didn\u2019t see\u2026 <b><i>oh shit</i></b>.</p><p><g class=\"gr_ gr_513 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"513\" data-gr-id=\"513\">Next</g> to the seat where Steve was sitting, your eyes focused on the red lace underwear that was stuck in the crease between the back cushion and seat cushion. <i><b>How</b> did that even get there?</i> You walked over to Steve casually as if there was nothing wrong in the world and sat right next to him.</p><p>\u201cThe couch looked more comfortable than standing,\u201d Steve said. You didn\u2019t realize how crystal blue his eyes were.</p><p>\u201cAnd I took you for a rule follower,\u201d you said as you reached a hand behind you to grab the lingerie without him noticing. After awkwardly adjusting yourself a few times, the soft fabric touched your palm and you held on to it for dear life. <b>Operation Underwear was a success.</b></p><p>\u201cIs your arm okay?\u201d Steve asked, looking concerned. \u201cYou don\u2019t really look comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this\u2026 is\u2026 uh actually my usual stretch after work,\u201d you said with a nervous smile.</p><p>\u201cHere, I can help you stretch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m-\u201c \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <i>(Play <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqxIjfFmV-pk&amp;t=NGQxNjM1OGQzNDczZjE0ODc0NDUwMGQ3YjAzNjExOTQ3ZmM3MTFkMixrSWpjeTEzTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AAjgURzGrP8JanXxNI8OW6A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fluniellar.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F185826947373%2Fencounter-steve-rogers-x-reader-one-shot&amp;m=1\">this</a> for some music)</i></p><p>He leaned in closer for your arm and you met him midway to stop him. Time stopped as you felt his soft, warm breath brush against your cheeks. His baby blue eyes stared into yours, piercing through you. You felt transparent like he could see through you. Maybe he could see how badly I was tempted to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m ok-\u201d</p><p>Before you could finish your sentence, you watched as his gaze switched from your eyes to your lips. Then, his lips collided with yours. When your lips found him, his lips slowly opened yours for his tongue and it was like fire meeting gas. You quickly stuffed the fabric in your hand deeper into the couch and used the new free hand to caress his face. He held on to the side of your neck as you devoured each other.</p><p>When you pulled away, you were desperately trying to catch your breath. Steve rested his forehead on your shoulder as he was breathing irregularly as well. It was hard to stop yourself from ripping the t-shirt off him as you were staring directly at his shirt stretched over his shoulder and chest muscles. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve,\u201d you started.</p><p>\u201cSorry if that was-,\u201d he replied in between his breaths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need you to look at me before I rip that shirt off you.\u201d You blurted out shamelessly. He lifted his head from your shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you say rip my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>,\u201d you whispered as you climbed into his lap. His body was warm like a towel fresh out of the dryer against yours. He grabbed your hair that was in a messy bun and pulled the hair tie from it. You giggled as your hair dropped all over your face. He pushed the hair aside and caressed your face. The way he held your face was different from all the other guys who held you before. <b>You felt safe and sheltered with him.</b></p><p>He moved his hand down on to your shirt collar. Starting from the top, he slowly unbuttoned the buttons one by one. When he reached the button at your cleavage, he looked up for your approval. You placed your hands over his and helped him unbutton the rest. When he reached the last one, you stripped off the white shirt and threw it on the floor. You eyed his shirt and he followed. In one fluid motion, he pulled the shirt off him and threw it in the same pile as yours.</p><p>In the light, your scars from training and work were apparent. Without a word, he traced your skin with his finger. He ran over the long scar between my chest and shoulder, the bullet wound from the bullet that grazed your waist, and many more. His eyes calmly followed each scar. You saw the scars on his porcelain skin too, but you didn\u2019t want to interrupt.</p><p>\u201c<i>How much did it hurt</i>?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bullet wound was a pain to recover from, but for the most of them I didn\u2019t even know I was hurt until after.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to meet your eyes. His face clearly told you that he was upset about something. He touched a scar close to where your heart was racing. \u201cHow am I supposed to be okay with you showing up to work every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know the answer to that, Steve.\u201d You smiled at his protectiveness. It was definitely a major turn-on. \u201c<i><b>We both love what we do</b></i>.\u201d</p><p>You moved his hand and softly kissed a faint scar on his chest. When you pulled away, his lips awaited yours. This kiss was gentle, timid, and sweet.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFrom now, I want you to share your pain with me.\u201d</p><p>You nodded with a smile. He reached his arms around your legs and you wrapped your arms around his neck. He stood effortlessly from the couch, supporting you in his arms. You kissed as he walked down the hallway and into the bedroom. Pulling away from the kiss, he gently placed you on the bed and pulled off your pants.</p><p>\u201cI promise, this is the first time I\u2019m having sleeping with someone on the first date,\u201d he said as he dropped his pants on the floor.</p><p>You rolled your eyes at him. \u201cJust shut up and just do me already.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>Ugh.</b></p><p>Your body naturally woke up at 6 am. You opened your eyes to the sound of birds chirping outside. From the window, you saw the pale yellow sky that signaled the sun was coming up. You tried to reach for your phone on the end table, but your body felt sore all over. <i>Yes, including the space between your legs that will not be mentioned</i><b>.</b> You tried to toss around the queen-sized bed but felt something, no <b>someone</b> behind your back. Keeping the blankets wrapped around your naked body, you inched your body little by little until you were facing his peaceful, sleeping face.</p><p>It was a strange feeling waking up next to another person. Most of your relationships, if you can even call it that, were one night stands and this was welcomed change. For minutes, you held your breath and admired Steve\u2019s long eyelashes up close. They had to be longer than yours.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he whispered, making you jump.</p><p>\u201cHow did you-\u201d I stuttered.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and his brilliant blue eyes greeted you. \u201cI\u2019m a light sleeper.\u201d His eyes were all that you needed to start <g class=\"gr_ gr_543 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"543\" data-gr-id=\"543\">craving</g> him again. \u201cOh no, I remember that look from last night.\u201d</p><p>You smiled as you pressed your bare body against his bare body. <i>Oh, and that\u2019s the morning wood.</i> You grinned harder and he buried his face into your neck in shyness. When he pulled away, your phone went off. Keeping the covers on you, you reached your sore body and grabbed the phone. It was a text from Ben. You had to go. When you glanced back, Steve was already putting on his underwear.</p><p>\u201cLet me make you something before you go,\u201d he said, getting up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you agreed. Before he stepped out of the bedroom, you called his name again. \u201cAm I going to see you tonight?\u201d It was weird asking for a second date. It was a strange mix of anticipation and fear. Was this what it felt like to be committed to someone?\u00a0</p><p>He looked funny smiling by the doorway only in his boxer briefs. Then, he walked over to you and kissed your forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until you get sick of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, by the way,\u201d you whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t planning to leave even if you asked.\u201d</p><p>We both smiled at each other anticipating our new forever.</p><p>_____<i>\u2018Cause when you love someone<br>You open up your heart<br>When you love someone<br>You make room<br>If you love someone<br>And you\u2019re not afraid to lose 'em<br>You\u2019ll probably never love someone like I do<br>You\u2019ll probably never love someone like I do</i>__<b>Love Someone - Lukas Graham</b></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>A/N:</b>&nbsp;I was inspired to write this listening to&nbsp;&lsquo;Love Someone&rsquo; by Lukas Graham, so I&rsquo;m dedicating the title to the song. I also linked the song where you guys should start listening to really immerse yourself in the storyline. Get ready for the fluff of your life.<br /></p><p><b>Summary:</b> High profile cases always got transferred to SHIELD. You show up to the transfer, dreading every second of it. Things start to turn around when Steve Rogers steps out from the shadows.

The scent of iron lingered around from the blood splatters on the red brick walls, but you forgot that it was there now. The sky above was shrouded in darkness, but the tall, bright skyscrapers that towered above shined enough light in the alleyway.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<b>Agent Y/L/N</b>,&rdquo; a familiar name called from behind.</p><p>You got up from the floor and looked at your colleague who was walking towards you. Immediately, your eyes moved to the extra cup of coffee in his hands. You eyed the coffee and he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;No, this is for me because I&rsquo;m taking over for the rest of the night. You need to go home and rest for once,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>You glanced at the watch on your wrist. You started the day on the scene at 7am and it was almost 11pm now. It was hard keeping track of time on the scene, but you loved that part of your job, too.</p><p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; you started to say when he placed the cups down on the floor and placed his hand over his ears.</p><p><b>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear anything!&rdquo;</b></p><p>You rolled your eyes. This was his signature move that you knew so well.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, he magically displaced his hands as if he could hear everything, to begin with. You smiled and waved goodbye and he called your name again.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, you are going to hate this. But, we have a SHIELD agent waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You groaned instinctively and heard Ben laugh in the distance. Since you joined the FBI, you encountered everything you trained for in the first few years. But, things started changing fast. One random day later, you were dealing with cases that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before. Alien body cleanup, superhuman strength beings, and laser shooting reptiles. You were always told to pursue a case until the SHIELD hand-off. <b>That has always been the policy.</b></p><p>The most upsetting part of the SHIELD cases was that those were the most interesting ones. Most days you were dealing with homicides and healthcare fraud cases, but once in a while, you would get cases like this one today. The kind that made you want to show up at 7 am and work on all day. But, of course. It was hand-off time again.</p><p>You walked out of the alleyway and there was a tall figure standing by the lamp post. Unlike most SHIELD agents you encountered in the past, he wasn&rsquo;t dressed in the familiar uniform. He was wearing slim fit jeans and a brown leather jacket. When you got within five feet from him, he turned around. You stopped mid-tracks because you knew this face.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent,&rdquo; he said, walking towards you with his voice submerging deep into the night.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Cap&hellip;captain?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Captain America was standing in front of you. Confused, you looked around to see if there was anyone else nearby and saw nothing. It was just another street scene in New York. <i><b>Did he just walk over here by himself?</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Call me Steve,&rdquo; he said casually and politely smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; you replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, agent Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and nodded. It was strange hearing your name come from him, but you also realized it was time for the file exchange. Due to the privacy and confidentiality of the files, all file sharing was done with the Stark Industries issued watch device that all the FBI, CIA, and SHIELD agents were required to have on. These watches were also programmed to clear memory once it stopped tracking your heartbeat and brain activity.</p><p>You reached out your right arm with the watch to Steve. He glanced over at you. &ldquo;Ah, familiar with the routine.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point, you would be shouting all the profanities you could think of for unnecessarily wasting your time, but you <b><i>revered</i></b> Captain America. He fought to save the city. No, <b>the world</b>.</p><p>You coughed to clear your throat. &ldquo;Are you going to scan?&rdquo; You hinted politely and watched as he took out his transfer initiating tool with the SHIELD logo printed on it. He moved the device over your watch and paused. You eagerly eyed for him to press the green transfer button, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;Um Y/N,&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;Can I buy you a drink after this?&rdquo;</p><p>Confused and startled by his question, you slightly tilted your head as a natural reflex of your habit. He smiled again, this time showing his perfect teeth back at you.</p><p>You realized that it was Saturday night and your only plans were to go back to the apartment and treat yourself to a glass of wine and some leftover dinner from yesterday.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you buying?&rdquo; You replied playfully and he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, he initiated the transfer and within seconds, your hard worked files were delivered to the SHIELD operation center. You felt a small buzz around the wrist notifying you that the process was completed successfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said and you followed him.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>After a few blocks of walking and making small talk about his day and yours, Steve stopped in front of a small bar. There was a neon sign that read &ldquo;Marley&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the streets were empty. It felt like a ghost town.</p><p>You were about to head in when Steve stopped you in place. His hand was gripped around your upper arm. You turned around and saw that he was pointing at your chest area. At first glance, it was completely inappropriate for him to be pointing at your chest, but seconds after you realized that he was pointing at your FBI jacket.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, right!&rdquo; You said as you quickly took it off and tucked it into your arms.</p><p>He let his grip free and walked in front of you to open the door. You thanked him and walked inside the bar to a large crowd of people that was 180-degree contrast from the empty streets outside. Music played from the speakers at a moderate volume so you could still hear everyone talking.</p><p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Steve spoke leaning into my ears. You followed him to an empty spot at the bar and we both got settled. He waved the bartender over and handed him his card.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a glass of whiskey on the rocks and Y/N?&rdquo; He turned to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have what he&rsquo;s having,&rdquo; you replied looking at the bartender. He nodded and went to make the drinks. You felt Steve&rsquo;s stare as he opened his lips to make a comment.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Whiskey</i>?&rdquo; He hinted.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I can still walk you home.&rdquo; You answered as you took a hair tie from your wrist and tied your hair up in a bun. The body heat in the small space was starting to slowly creep up on you.</p><p>The glasses of whiskey came out and the bartender handed Steve his card back.</p><p>&ldquo;Keep the tab open,&rdquo; Steve said as he grabbed the card. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just getting started.&rdquo;</p><p>You shot him a playful glare and he laughed. He raised his glass to you and you met him with yours. The whiskey felt refreshing going down your system and naturally, your face cringed at the first taste of the strong alcohol. This was a set up from the red wine at home.</p><p>Steve shook his head with the smile glued to his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still going to need you to walk me home.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt your face heating up as you nudged him. You took another sip, this time being 100% aware of your expressions.</p><p>&ldquo;How long have you been with the Bureau?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Seven years,&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;I joined as a field agent as soon as I finished school.&rdquo; It was crazy how you were sitting in a bar, drinking, and casually talking to Captain America.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you knew exactly what you wanted to do&hellip; do you have any regrets?&rdquo; He asked and you thought about the question for a while. Sure, you had regrets. <i>Who doesn&rsquo;t?</i> You were the most jealous of all of your friends who were married and starting a family of their own. You were still battling one night stands and a reasonable work-life balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Not being able to start a family,&rdquo; you answered truthfully and Steve&rsquo;s face turned concerned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I still wouldn&rsquo;t trade my job for that. Not yet, at least.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded in deep thought. I knew a little about his story, but I knew that he was frozen in ice and come back to a world he no longer knew anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, about the downer comment.&rdquo; You said and he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not your fault. Sorry, if I spaced out for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled back at him encouragingly and he down the rest of the whiskey. The bartender was by our side quickly and Steve put in another order.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and find a bathroom, don&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo; He said, leaning in again. You nodded and he disappeared into the crowd. You finished your drink too and the bartender came back with two whiskeys on the rocks. As soon as he set the new glasses on the table, you felt a heavy hand on your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; You started to say as you turned your head towards the figure. To your surprise, it wasn&rsquo;t Steve. There was an unfamiliar, tall and muscular man with a large beard standing next to you. You immediately got up from the seat, shaking his hand off your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, missy. Can I get you a drink?&rdquo; He said with a smile. Even standing, he was at least a head taller than you.</p><p>&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; You respectfully declined. He took a step closer, leaning against the bar ledge.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, a pretty lady like you needs something prettier than whiskey on the rocks.&rdquo;</p><p>You already had it with him. &ldquo;I said I wasn&rsquo;t interested.&rdquo; You said glaring back at him who was clearly looking around uncomfortably now. The people in close proximity started stealing glances to you.</p><p>Then, his hand grabbed on to your wrist again. His grip was firmer and that quickly caught you off guard. &ldquo;Hey, I wasn&rsquo;t really asking,&rdquo; he replied smoothly.</p><p>You sighed as you quickly grabbed his hand over your wrist and easily maneuvered yourself out of his grip. It was Self Defense 101. He stumbled backward and his body collided with people behind him. More eyes around the room turned to you now. You had to de-escalate before things got worse for him. You grabbed the jacket on the table and turned away from him. Before you could take another step, a heavy thud landed on your shoulder.</p><p><i><b>Okay, no.</b></i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;FB-&ldquo; You started to say when a figure jumped in between you and him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Steve chimed in as he removed the hand from my shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; The voice asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Her boyfriend,&rdquo; Steve answered calmly without hesitation.</p><p>You stared at Steve confusingly trying to understand what cards he was looking to play. The guy took a step back. After a long glare at you, he turned away.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve-&ldquo; You started to say and he cut you off.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey honey, why don&rsquo;t we step out?&rdquo;</p><p>Once outside, Steve asked you to lead the way to your house. You walked side by side with him in mostly silence until he cleared his throat.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</i></p><p>You stopped and turned to look at him. He stopped as well. &ldquo;I appreciate the help, but I could have taken care of him by myself.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyebrows narrowed at you. &ldquo;<i>By arresting the guy? Beating him up</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He<b> deserved </b>it,&rdquo; you sighed.</p><p>Steve stepped closer to you, closing the gap between. &ldquo;I agree, and wanted to throw a punch across his face too.&rdquo; You watched as his hand curled up to a tight fist. His strong jawline was prominent underneath the street lamp. Then, it quickly relaxed. &ldquo;But, if you can avoid conflict, you need to. Even if the guy is a piece of garbage like him.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew that he was right and you hated him for it. Being short tempered definitely made the job harder than it had to be, but compared to the rookie days, you learned a lot of patience from it. Nothing did the job like a 4-hour report write up after spending 12 hours on the crime scene. You tore your eyes from Steve and continued to walk. You heard his footsteps follow behind.</p><p>When you finally arrived in front of your apartment building you looked back at Steve. Out of your many flaws, being stubborn was your greatest one. Sure, it had benefits like always getting what you wanted, but you were always the last to apologize. After a quick exhales, you bit your tongue and blurted.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Steve replied, clearly confused.</p><p>&ldquo;I have&hellip; mild anger issues and I let that out on you,&rdquo; you confessed.</p><p>A second later, he started to laugh. You stared back with a blank face. &ldquo;Sorry, sorry.&rdquo; He managed in between his laughs. &ldquo;Thank you for your apology.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there something on my face?&rdquo; You asked and he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;The whole time I was walking behind you&hellip; I was thinking about how upset you were at me now when all I wanted was to grab a drink with you because you looked so beautiful in your uniform back there. It was just unexpected.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt your cheek warm up and your tense energy drain from you. Steve&rsquo;s smile was contagious and a smile crept up on your face too.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to come in to finish that drink?&rdquo; You asked and he nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like that.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>As you unlocked the front door, your mind went wild with all the chores you put off. Unwashed dishes in the sink and loads of laundry on the floor, the moment you opened the door you looked back at Steve.</p><p>&ldquo;I need you to stay right here for a second.&rdquo;</p><p>You ran through the living room straight to the bedroom and raked all the clothes on the floor underneath the bed. Midway clothes raking you realized that you were cleaning the bedroom as if Steve was going to come here. You dropped everything and peeked at the front doorway and didn&rsquo;t see Steve standing there as you ordered.</p><p>Panicking, you walked through the hallway and saw Steve sitting on the couch in the living room. He took off his leather jacket and was wearing a tight-fitting white t-shirt now. Tearing your eyes from him perfectly built body, your eyes scanned every corner to see if anything was out of place. Minus the random books and magazines scattered around the space, you didn&rsquo;t see&hellip; <b><i>oh shit</i></b>.</p><p>Next to the seat where Steve was sitting, your eyes focused on the red lace underwear that was stuck in the crease between the back cushion and seat cushion. <i><b>How</b> did that even get there?</i> You walked over to Steve casually as if there was nothing wrong in the world and sat right next to him.</p><p>&ldquo;The couch looked more comfortable than standing,&rdquo; Steve said. You didn&rsquo;t realize how crystal blue his eyes were.</p><p>&ldquo;And I took you for a rule follower,&rdquo; you said as you reached a hand behind you to grab the lingerie without him noticing. After awkwardly adjusting yourself a few times, the soft fabric touched your palm and you held on to it for dear life. <b>Operation Underwear was a success.</b></p><p>&ldquo;Is your arm okay?&rdquo; Steve asked, looking concerned. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really look comfortable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, this&hellip; is&hellip; uh actually my usual stretch after work,&rdquo; you said with a nervous smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, I can help you stretch it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m-&ldquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>(Play <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqxIjfFmV-pk&amp;t=NGQxNjM1OGQzNDczZjE0ODc0NDUwMGQ3YjAzNjExOTQ3ZmM3MTFkMixrSWpjeTEzTA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AAjgURzGrP8JanXxNI8OW6A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fluniellar.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F185826947373%2Fencounter-steve-rogers-x-reader-one-shot&amp;m=1\">this</a> for some music)</i></p><p>He leaned in closer for your arm and you met him midway to stop him. Time stopped as you felt his soft, warm breath brush against your cheeks. His baby blue eyes stared into yours, piercing through you. You felt transparent like he could see through you. Maybe he could see how badly I was tempted to kiss him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m- I&rsquo;m ok-&rdquo;</p><p>Before you could finish your sentence, you watched as his gaze switched from your eyes to your lips. Then, his lips collided with yours. When your lips found him, his lips slowly opened yours for his tongue and it was like fire meeting gas. You quickly stuffed the fabric in your hand deeper into the couch and used the new free hand to caress his face. He held on to the side of your neck as you devoured each other.</p><p>When you pulled away, you were desperately trying to catch your breath. Steve rested his forehead on your shoulder as he was breathing irregularly as well. It was hard to stop yourself from ripping the t-shirt off him as you were staring directly at his shirt stretched over his shoulder and chest muscles. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; you started.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry if that was-,&rdquo; he replied in between his breaths.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need you to look at me before I rip that shirt off you.&rdquo; You blurted out shamelessly. He lifted his head from your shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you say rip my shirt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>,&rdquo; you whispered as you climbed into his lap. His body was warm like a towel fresh out of the dryer against yours. He grabbed your hair that was in a messy bun and pulled the hair tie from it. You giggled as your hair dropped all over your face. He pushed the hair aside and caressed your face. The way he held your face was different from all the other guys who held you before. <b>You felt safe and sheltered with him.</b></p><p>He moved his hand down on to your shirt collar. Starting from the top, he slowly unbuttoned the buttons one by one. When he reached the button at your cleavage, he looked up for your approval. You placed your hands over his and helped him unbutton the rest. When he reached the last one, you stripped off the white shirt and threw it on the floor. You eyed his shirt and he followed. In one fluid motion, he pulled the shirt off him and threw it in the same pile as yours.</p><p>In the light, your scars from training and work were apparent. Without a word, he traced your skin with his finger. He ran over the long scar between my chest and shoulder, the bullet wound from the bullet that grazed your waist, and many more. His eyes calmly followed each scar. You saw the scars on his porcelain skin too, but you didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>How much did it hurt</i>?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The bullet wound was a pain to recover from, but for the most of them I didn&rsquo;t even know I was hurt until after.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up to meet your eyes. His face clearly told you that he was upset about something. He touched a scar close to where your heart was racing. &ldquo;How am I supposed to be okay with you showing up to work every day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already know the answer to that, Steve.&rdquo; You smiled at his protectiveness. It was definitely a major turn-on. &ldquo;<i><b>We both love what we do</b></i>.&rdquo;</p><p>You moved his hand and softly kissed a faint scar on his chest. When you pulled away, his lips awaited yours. This kiss was gentle, timid, and sweet.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;From now, I want you to share your pain with me.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded with a smile. He reached his arms around your legs and you wrapped your arms around his neck. He stood effortlessly from the couch, supporting you in his arms. You kissed as he walked down the hallway and into the bedroom. Pulling away from the kiss, he gently placed you on the bed and pulled off your pants.</p><p>&ldquo;I promise, this is the first time I&rsquo;m having sleeping with someone on the first date,&rdquo; he said as he dropped his pants on the floor.</p><p>You rolled your eyes at him. &ldquo;Just shut up and just do me already.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Ugh.</b></p><p>Your body naturally woke up at 6 am. You opened your eyes to the sound of birds chirping outside. From the window, you saw the pale yellow sky that signaled the sun was coming up. You tried to reach for your phone on the end table, but your body felt sore all over. <i>Yes, including the space between your legs that will not be mentioned</i><b>.</b> You tried to toss around the queen-sized bed but felt something, no <b>someone</b> behind your back. Keeping the blankets wrapped around your naked body, you inched your body little by little until you were facing his peaceful, sleeping face.</p><p>It was a strange feeling waking up next to another person. Most of your relationships, if you can even call it that, were one night stands and this was welcomed change. For minutes, you held your breath and admired Steve&rsquo;s long eyelashes up close. They had to be longer than yours.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he whispered, making you jump.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you-&rdquo; I stuttered.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and his brilliant blue eyes greeted you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a light sleeper.&rdquo; His eyes were all that you needed to start craving him again. &ldquo;Oh no, I remember that look from last night.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled as you pressed your bare body against his bare body. <i>Oh, and that&rsquo;s the morning wood.</i> You grinned harder and he buried his face into your neck in shyness. When he pulled away, your phone went off. Keeping the covers on you, you reached your sore body and grabbed the phone. It was a text from Ben. You had to go. When you glanced back, Steve was already putting on his underwear.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me make you something before you go,&rdquo; he said, getting up from the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you agreed. Before he stepped out of the bedroom, you called his name again. &ldquo;Am I going to see you tonight?&rdquo; It was weird asking for a second date. It was a strange mix of anticipation and fear. Was this what it felt like to be committed to someone?&nbsp;</p><p>He looked funny smiling by the doorway only in his boxer briefs. Then, he walked over to you and kissed your forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here until you get sick of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to happen, by the way,&rdquo; you whispered back.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t planning to leave even if you asked.&rdquo;</p><p>We both smiled at each other anticipating our new forever.</p><p>_____<i>&lsquo;Cause when you love someone<br />You open up your heart<br />When you love someone<br />You make room<br />If you love someone<br />And you&rsquo;re not afraid to lose 'em<br />You&rsquo;ll probably never love someone like I do<br />You&rsquo;ll probably never love someone like I do</i>__<b>Love Someone - Lukas Graham</b></p>",

The scent of iron lingered around from the blood splatters on the red brick walls, but you forgot that it was there now. The sky above was shrouded in darkness, but the tall, bright skyscrapers that towered above shined enough light in the alleyway.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;<b>Agent Y/L/N</b>,&rdquo; a familiar name called from behind.</p>\n<p>You got up from the floor and looked at your colleague who was walking towards you. Immediately, your eyes moved to the extra cup of coffee in his hands. You eyed the coffee and he shook his head.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, this is for me because I&rsquo;m taking over for the rest of the night. You need to go home and rest for once,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>You glanced at the watch on your wrist. You started the day on the scene at 7am and it was almost 11pm now. It was hard keeping track of time on the scene, but you loved that part of your job, too.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; you started to say when he placed the cups down on the floor and placed his hand over his ears.</p>\n<p><b>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear anything!&rdquo;</b></p>\n<p>You rolled your eyes. This was his signature move that you knew so well.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then, he magically displaced his hands as if he could hear everything, to begin with. You smiled and waved goodbye and he called your name again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;By the way, you are going to hate this. But, we have a SHIELD agent waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You groaned instinctively and heard Ben laugh in the distance. Since you joined the FBI, you encountered everything you trained for in the first few years. But, things started changing fast. One random day later, you were dealing with cases that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before. Alien body cleanup, superhuman strength beings, and laser shooting reptiles. You were always told to pursue a case until the SHIELD hand-off. <b>That has always been the policy.</b></p>\n</p>",

Chris followed shortly after meeting you at the waiting elevator.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre you here alone?</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, no, no, I\u2019m here with friends.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cChris?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>At the sound of another voice in the hallway, Chris spun around. His eyes flew open, and you felt a gentle but strong push. You stumbled into the elevator just before the doors close. You took a breath and closed your eyes.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cGood job Vix, first vacation in two years and you sleep with a stranger and marry him, but not just any stranger, Captain America himself.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You rolled your eyes and impatiently rode the elevator down to the lobby. You tried your best to calm down and not go crazy with thoughts. Once the doors opened, you looked over yourself and tried to ignore the fact you wore <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/pyW6nzP/dress-2.jpg\">last night\u2019s sexy dress</a>. It was Vegas after all you wouldn\u2019t stand out. You walked into the lobby and looked around, <g class=\"gr_ gr_532 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"532\" data-gr-id=\"532\">unsure</g> what to do. You walked to the front desk attendant.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cExcuse me; I\u2019m looking for some information. Do you know how to get to The Little White Chapel?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOooh, someone getting married? Congratulations!\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You tried hard not to make a disgusted face.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, no marriage, just sightseeing, I hear tons of celebs got married there. I\u2019d love to see it,\u201d you lied.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, a lot of celebrities have gotten married there. I can have one of the cars prepped to take you there.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s one of the perks of staying with us here. If you\u2019re going to spend nine hundred a night for a stay, it\u2019s the least we can offer.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You opened your eyes wide.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNine hundred. Yeah. At least my money I well spent.\u201d You smiled. Once the lobby attendant looked away, you shook your head.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>After a few moments, the attendant looked up and smiled.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere, all booked. The driver will pull around in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You walked toward the doors and dug into your clutch for your phone, but you were disappointed to find it completely dead. \u00a0You knew your friends were probably trying to get a hold of you. \u00a0Before you lost patience, you felt someone touch your elbow, and with it, the electric charge spiked again.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Chris said now wearing a low tipped baseball hat.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAbout what, shoving me into an elevator because you\u2019re ashamed of me?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He studied you, and you scoffed and shook your head.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cKidding, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You walked out and into the waiting <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/7XRTvGr/car.jpg\">car</a>. During the drive, you kept your eyes glued to the window as your thoughts floated further and further away from the car. The memory of you kissing across his skin kept flooding your head, and every time it did, you tried to force others to come back, but they didn\u2019t. You were becoming frustrated and annoyed.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOf all the things I want to forget in my life I can\u2019t and the one thing I want to remember I can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>You groaned again and looked next to you at Chris. He was scrolling through his phone. You looked over his long legs and to the hand that rested atop his knee. You licked your lips as you scanned his long fingers and again a memory flashed in your head. You laid on your back in the bed with his head suckling your breasts and his finger in your mouth. You could remember the sensations his mouth gave you, the chills that ran down your spine and the goosebumps that rose on your skin.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>You sank your teeth into your bottom lip and allowed another memory to flood you. Your back was arched off the bed, and your head tilted back. Chris was between your legs. The intensity of the pleasure that you remembered hit you like a ton of bricks.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cFuck, Chris Evans eats pussy, and he\u2019s good at it.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>A big wave of arousal hit you. You wanted him right here and right now. You clenched your thighs together and tried to ignore the desire within you. As if sensing your uneasiness, Chris looked to you and quirked his full eyebrow.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You cleared your throat and allowed a shiver to surface.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEm, yes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you responded as you looked away back out the window.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You smiled to yourself and hoped he didn\u2019t see it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3aea54329f7932db8a89a9430115b5f/tumblr_inline_pt9m5t4f0s1roq91t_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/></figure><p>\u00a0Before you knew it, the car stopped in front of the chapel. You stepped out, and Chris walked around to meet you. As you walked inside, you took in the cheesy d\u00e9cor, and that was all it took for your resting bitch face to change to a horrified look. You looked around the lobby and turned your lip up. You weren\u2019t disgusted per se, but you were incredibly disappointed this was where you got married. Before you could look around anymore, a loud booming voice rang out from behind you.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I help you two?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You looked over the tall man with dark to black hair and a bright smile on his face.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. We were hoping we could get some information,\u201d Chris began.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAll right, with what? Were you two lovebirds looking to get married? I can tell two people in love when I see them and you two\u2014love,\u201d he said.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>You looked at the stranger next to you at the same moment his eyes met yours. He quirked his lips into an amused smirk, then cleared his throat.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not looking to get married. Can we speak somewhere more private?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>He nodded and motioned to his right. You and Chris walked the path of the hallway and into an office with the name plaque that said, <i>Richard Morton</i>.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Once you walked into the office, you sat in the seats in front of the office desk.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cHow can I help now?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>You dug into your clutch and took out the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Richard looked at the paper and skimmed the details and nodded every few seconds.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThis is a marriage certificate,\u201d Richard asserted.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes, we know that much but\u2014,\u201d Chris began before you cut him off.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWhat he is beating around the bush to ask is; is this for real?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Richard looked between the two of you and nodded.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cIs the marriage certificate real?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. Look, we don\u2019t remember much um, it\u2019s a little embarrassing to admit, but we don\u2019t remember much. We came here to understand why we have this,\u201d Chris explained.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I can help with that. You have this because you applied for it and it is to validate the union,\u201d Richard clarified.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cValidate?\u201d Chris questioned.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cUnion?\u201d You inquired.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>Your mouth filled with a bad taste similar to the taste one got before they vomited.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that um, that we\u2014him and I\u2014,\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cGot married. Yes, by the looks of this, the certificate has my name and this establishment. You were married here last night.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed as he sunk back into the chair.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>You immediately began hyperventilating in the seat beside him.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cOh my god. I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>You jumped up and hurried to the closest thing you could find\u2014a garbage can. As you bent everything came up. Within seconds you felt soft, strong hands rest on your waist and lower back and then felt your hair being held back. You could feel his body heat radiating onto yours and smell his intoxicating scent.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere you go, get it all out. Do you have some water, Richard? Maybe a paper towel too?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Richard hurried out the office leaving the two of you there. This was not cute. You felt Chris rub your back in a soothing way, a way that made you shiver.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cAt least he\u2019s not an asshole Vix.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Richard rushed back in with the requested items. As you came upright, Chris held out the paper towel to you for you to wipe your mouth and then passed you the water bottle. You took a sip, swished it around your mouth, gargled the spit into the garbage can.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cThere. Better?\u201d Chris asked with concern shining through his eyes. You nodded and looked to Richard whose eyes were fixed on the garbage can full of vomit with a disgusted look.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>He nodded and looked away, then his face lit up.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I remember you two, mainly I remember that tattoo. I\u2019m sorry for not recognizing you sooner, but we marry at least a hundred people a night. I remember you two now. You came in around 3am, and honestly, you both clearly had alcohol in your system, but you swore you knew what you were doing. You couldn\u2019t keep your hands off each other really. Even when you had to separate to get dressed in the garments you found in the boutique, it took nearly fifteen minutes before you separated. We couldn\u2019t get through the ceremony with you trying to kiss each other. My wife was here, and she said she saw something in the two of you, something she says will take you long and far. Anyway, yes, you\u2019re married,\u201d Richard explained.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You and Chris exchanged looks <g class=\"gr_ gr_565 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"565\" data-gr-id=\"565\">as</g> the final piece of evidence <g class=\"gr_ gr_566 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"566\" data-gr-id=\"566\">was</g> presented. Richard held out a sheet of pictures to the two of you. Chris made no move to take the photo, so you did. When you looked at it there, you stood dressed in a white dress that clearly looked like something from a French costume party. Your arm was draped through Chris\u2019 with your cheek pressed to his. The two of you were smiling widely. Yes, you looked tipsy but not flat out drunk, somehow you looked happy. You looked to the two other pictures; one was of the two of you kissing. Your leg was up, and he was holding you at your thigh. There was not a single space between your bodies. The final picture was the two of you holding your hands up, showing off your new rings.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you groaned slapping your hand to your forehead.</p><p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c805c42e6595a3ed28a783818f1dadd/tumblr_inline_pt9modV9Gb1roq91t_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\"/></figure><p><b><i>-Chris-</i></b></p><p>After a very quiet ride back to the hotel, he was pacing the balcony of his penthouse while she was locked in the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t believe the day he was having, couldn\u2019t believe any of this. He came to Vegas with Anthony, Seb, Mike, and Troy to unwind before the next bout of filming he was signed up for in a few weeks. It was his last night before they flew out that night and he chose to go to the casino to try his luck. Now he was married. Married! He stopped his movements and rested his elbows on the railing and peered out over the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. He gripped his head in his hands and groaned out.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Married. He\u2019d never thought to ever get married he was having too much fun enjoying his life and being a bachelor. Marriage was not where he was now; it was not what he had written in his cards.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never before made this mistake before. Why now? What was it about this woman? He thought back to last night, but it was still a blank. He didn\u2019t even remember sleeping with her, didn\u2019t remember meeting her, and surely didn\u2019t remember marrying her. He groaned again.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit, mom\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris gripped his head again before he turned away from the view to look into the living room of his penthouse. She was beautiful yes, very beautiful and she had plenty of curves, all the curves he could ever want but never had before. She was gorgeous, there was no denying it, but he\u2019d never fallen victim to a pretty face before. How did he now?</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It was then a memory swept over him. She <g class=\"gr_ gr_556 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"556\" data-gr-id=\"556\">was crouched</g> on her hands and knees on the bed with her perfect ass pointed to him. He sat there, admiring her perfect skin and dangerous arch in her back. She peeped back at him, bit her bottom lip and winked. In seconds he approached her and dropped a slap to her ass and dropped his mouth to her opening. She tasted good, like liquor and vanilla. Her moans were instantaneous, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to be the only thing he heard over his own beating heart. He gripped one of her shapely cheeks and quickly moved to the other to place a forceful bite on it. She flung her head back, and her hair whipped the top of his. He groaned and squeezed her flesh and went back to work.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Slowly the memory faded but the effects of the memory lingered. He licked his lips as if he could still taste her. He rubbed his chin and felt everything he felt in that moment. He wanted her. Chris turned his back to the window and looked back out over the horizon and firmly gripped the railing. He needed to get a grip. From inside, he heard the sound of her footsteps and took one final breath before he walked inside.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have to annul this,\u201d Chris began.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>He was surprised she did. Usually, women fell all over themselves when it came to him. Most would do anything to be in this situation, he still didn\u2019t understand it, but he didn\u2019t dwell on it. She didn\u2019t seem to be falling all over herself, that intrigued him.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe court. If we hurry, we can still catch them,\u201d he said.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Without a <g class=\"gr_ gr_534 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"534\" data-gr-id=\"534\">word</g> she walked to the door and out. Again, he was thrown off, but he followed.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>When they arrived at the courts, they were directed to the right floor and room. They filled out the paperwork and waited for their number to be called. The entire time Chris kept his hat tipped down, praying no one would recognize him. The last thing he needed was for this to be splattered all across UsWeekly or on TMZ. After nearly three hours, they approached the clerk\u2019s window.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A woman with grey hair and <g class=\"gr_ gr_605 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"605\" data-gr-id=\"605\">a young</g> face sat behind the thick glass looking at them expectantly; \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He looked at you, and you looked at him; neither of you sure who would do the talking. He stepped forward and pushed the papers under the glass.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019d like to process these for an annulment please,\u201d he explained.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The woman took the papers skimmed through them and began tapping keys on her computer.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYour names.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cUh, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>The woman looked up and stared at him.</p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAs in the actor?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo, no relation.

Let me ask a few questions. Since the two of you are over eighteen parental consent is not necessary, that takes one off. Was either of you mentally incapacitated? Either one or both of you didn\u2019t understand what you were doing?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Again you both looked at each other, knowing that answer was no. As if sensing the answer, the clerk drew a line on the paperwork through that option.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFraud? Were either of you coerced into this marriage under false pretenses?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Vixen shook her head, and he followed, again the clerk drew a line through that option.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cAre you two related?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both shook your head no again, and another line was drawn.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cWere either of you married to someone else at the time of your marriage?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. Another line.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right that leaves one, was the marriage consummated?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both looked at each other again, and his eyes dipped down, and it was then he saw hickeys on your neck and shoulder. Another memory washed over him. She was sitting on his lap moving her hips hypnotically against him. Her lips were moving tantalizingly slow against his in a searing kiss, a kiss that sucked all air out of his lungs, but he didn\u2019t want to stop. She bit his bottom lip, and he moaned loudly before he gripped her hips and moved her on him. He took control and stood <g class=\"gr_ gr_551 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"551\" data-gr-id=\"551\">holding</g> her against his body. He then dropped her onto the bed and continued thrusting in her. She felt good, too good. Her nails scraping along his back was the last thing he remembered before the memory faded. He cleared his throat loudly and looked away from her.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYes, it was consummated,\u201d he responded as low as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, unfortunately, an annulment is not possible for the two of you. Those are the grounds, and your situation does not meet any of them,\u201d the clerk explained.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What are we supposed to do? Vixen asked.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cStay married, or file for a proper divorce, the choice is yours. Although he\u2019s a hot one girl why the rush? Hang on to him.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris pinched his lips together and smiled at the compliment.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both walked to the side feeling completely defeated. As you walked out the building, you both stood atop the steps just looking out.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can contact my lawyer back in LA, and we\u2019ll get started on the divorce you can come by his office and sign the paperwork. Do you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He looked to her and saw a faraway look on her face, a look of disbelief.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVixen,\u201d he said, <g class=\"gr_ gr_521 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"521\" data-gr-id=\"521\">liking</g> the way her name felt on his lips, liking the way he felt saying her name. He shook his head and hoped the feeling shook off as well. She looked to him with a blank look.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cDo you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, no. San Fran,\u201d she responded.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, I can make a detour to LA for a day or two.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right, good, then we can get this handled discreetly, my lawyer is the best,\u201d he assured.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>She didn\u2019t look to have heard a word because she walked away with the same look of disbelief on her face. He probably would have the same look, but he refused to let the last twenty-four hours marinate, he refused to allow his foolish actions to seep in. He refused to allow the voice of his mother or father <g class=\"gr_ gr_535 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"535\" data-gr-id=\"535\">infiltrate</g> his brain. If he did, he knew he\u2019d look just like her.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>TagList:</b></p><p><br/></p><p>@sarahboseman <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtVJSemJlAShWpR9gsdxIXg\">@heyauntieeee</a> @airis-paris14 @thiccdaddy-mbaku\n@wakandas-vibranium @wakanda-inspired @theunsweetenedtruth\n@ashanti-notthesinger @reignsxjackson @halfrican-heat @ambthegamer\n@simplyyamberr @muse-of-mbaku @sisterwifeudaku @mejustme06 @ilcb7\n@leahnicole1219 \u00a0@destinio1 @maliadestiny @drsunshine97 @blowmymbackout\n@purplehairgawdess @thehuntoyobun @wakandamama @wakandawinning @profilia\n@zxddy-panther @h-challa @babygirlofwakanda @misswakanda2018 @challaxkillmonger\n@ororowrites @hutchj @myfavemarvelfanfics @lavitabella87\n@afraiddreamingandloving @autumn242 @purple-apricots @skysynclair19\n@hersheyskissesss-blog @blue-ishx @blublubleu <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m62lZQNIjQ207syE6kuhpTQ\">@90sinspiredgirl</a>\n\u00a0@tchallaswife @tchallamakesmeh0lla @turn-thy-paige @blackchickfics\n@blackpantherismyish @inlovewithmakeupcomicsanimelove @naturally-bri\n@flawlesslybeautiful14 @qweentbh @lunaerly @theoutereffect\n@twilight-sapphire-lover @pupyluv247 @stark-red19 @cockyboysandsugarism\n@maverickabull @madbadsiren @aykanna @myaw731 @ruruly20 @mixedmelanin\n@brittyevans @bezzywazhere @laketaj24 @taint3dvirgin @soulsparker\n@theresnomoregoodones @syreanne @loveandcigarillos \u00a0@heybriheyyy @wakanda-bcth\n@uhlxis @yaachtynoboat711 @geeksareunique @bultalongthewayside @ajspencer1892\n@captiansaveasmut @imaginewhoever @terrablaze514 @starsshines-blog\n@scrumptiouslytenaciouscrusade @darkandlovely94 @sithlordslut @wavyyc\n@naturalistamisslyn @nigarachi15 @madamslayyy @blackandfair @kreolemami\n@mylastnameisthe-fish @kaykay0829 @chaneajoyyy @tequilajay27\n@blacklotus-of-the-black-kingdom @slimmiyagi @im5ftbutmythroat66 @jaeee-http\n@madhatterhelsing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miy4YUE1W_jRIn7ertQY3EQ\">@sunflowerpsalms</a>\n@wakanda-shit-is-that @deliciousstreetkidcroissant @jecourt @vebner37\n@disneysdarlingdiva @melaninmarvel @alanastormborn @dolphinpink310 @wonderbell\n@ohleucothea @queentearra @bitchbetterhavemydinner @fentybabyy @kaykay4454fan\n@priya212 @kitkit1690 @chrismarcs @beautycomesindifferentformsworld\n@blackpantherimagines @ovohanna24 @sweetpeachjones @kslo000 @nubian-queen18\n@omgsuperstarg \u00a0@prettyprincessushio @treeondrea \u00a0@ursapharoh05\n\u00a0@blackpinup22 @kaytauru @big3gocandykahn @kissingpineapples @wildaboutchrisevans\n@fitfineandstayingalive @misspooh @michele-onel @gorjiss @muva-milaje\n@limbo-limbo-limbo @awkwardlyabstract @blxck-brxndie \u00a0@meeky-imagines\n@inlovewith3 @metalarmlover @mellowjellow6 @sweettea-and-honeybutter\n@thatrandomhetaliachick @missdeerstalker15 @marvelheaux\n@romanceoftheeveryday-blog @mufasathatniggatho @cltex84 @sweetbearcolorgarden\n@msincognito67 @mosagram @mar-ta-3 @ljstraightnochaser @lewatigress\n@akimi-youngblood \u00a0@bekahdean87 @teechallas-blog @jasmindaughteroftheworld\n@cocooned-butterfly @emoniclark22 @chereedrop619 @theblulife @niggarachi15 \u00a0@great-neckpectations\n\u00a0@avenger-marvel-fan @arieljamiyla @vibranium-soul @apileofmiscsomethings\n@niecey4cocaine <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfXDGMr8OjRFSKdiRGhg9nQ\">@missumuch1918</a>\n@chillavesss @heynessss @shamelessqueenobservation @cetouna\n@cosmicmelaninflower \u00a0@tntnv @dopegalkk @babyblowomg\n@somansystars-and-westillstarve @determinednot2fall @zoezoe34 @chasingsunlight @somanystars-and-westillstarve\n@diamyyyyy @kumkaniudaku <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMskMXgAlLt36T6DC5fvuww\">@give-me-a-million-dollars-pls</a>\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFyvRXb9nWLPECVC3HxnKLw\">@shyblackgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbaJs0FogkED0K1cIDEDszQ\">@your-resident-evil</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCN9H075VBhzRbKm0QyrCnQ\">@stillevansbae</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8eeWDMU0PXerp8hisHG3Qg\">@sheisexcellent</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maTULSSOvLRt3Kz3L0gZfmw\">@oceanscorazon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNQzLGtsY8q_oRbA3i3flxQ\">@hautehoneyfitness</a>\n@bistoolada <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGYB3QPyE62f6TEZpQqTSg\">@igotmadskills</a> @adifferentme\n@bugngiz @mellowcyclepuppy @wellthirsted @caramara3\u200b @pananegra\u200b\u200b @amethyst09\u200b\u200b\n@champagnesugamama\u200b</p><p><br/></p><p><b>NOTE: I\u2019ve cleaned the taglist up a bit.

His eyes roamed over your figure. You weren\u2019t shy, never had been. You looked over, and it was then he looked away and turned his back to you. You looked over his muscular back and shoulders and down to his trim waist. He was beautiful. You could see freckles dusted across his skin and you had a flash of a memory of you kissing across his back and those same freckles. You froze and wrapped yourself in the memory, hoping more would come back. After a few seconds of the <g class=\"gr_ gr_562 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"562\" data-gr-id=\"562\">memory</g> it faded, leaving you frustrated but turned on.

It was Vegas after all you wouldn\u2019t stand out.

During the drive, you kept your eyes glued to the window as your thoughts floated further and further away from the car. The memory of you kissing across his skin kept flooding your head, and every time it did, you tried to force others to come back, but they didn\u2019t. You were becoming frustrated and annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOf all the things I want to forget in my life I can\u2019t and the one thing I want to remember I can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>You groaned again and looked next to you at Chris. He was scrolling through his phone. You looked over his long legs and to the hand that rested atop his knee. You licked your lips as you scanned his long fingers and again a memory flashed in your head. You laid on your back in the bed with his head suckling your breasts and his finger in your mouth. You could remember the sensations his mouth gave you, the chills that ran down your spine and the goosebumps that rose on your skin.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>You sank your teeth into your bottom lip and allowed another memory to flood you. Your back was arched off the bed, and your head tilted back. Chris was between your legs. The intensity of the pleasure that you remembered hit you like a ton of bricks.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cFuck, Chris Evans eats pussy, and he\u2019s good at it.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>A big wave of arousal hit you. You wanted him right here and right now. You clenched your thighs together and tried to ignore the desire within you. As if sensing your uneasiness, Chris looked to you and quirked his full eyebrow.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You cleared your throat and allowed a shiver to surface.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cEm, yes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you responded as you looked away back out the window.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You smiled to yourself and hoped he didn\u2019t see it.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3aea54329f7932db8a89a9430115b5f/tumblr_inline_pt9m5t4f0s1roq91t_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"></figure><p>\u00a0Before you knew it, the car stopped in front of the chapel. You stepped out, and Chris walked around to meet you. As you walked inside, you took in the cheesy d\u00e9cor, and that was all it took for your resting bitch face to change to a horrified look. You looked around the lobby and turned your lip up. You weren\u2019t disgusted per se, but you were incredibly disappointed this was where you got married. Before you could look around anymore, a loud booming voice rang out from behind you.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCan I help you two?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You looked over the tall man with dark to black hair and a bright smile on his face.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. We were hoping we could get some information,\u201d Chris began.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAll right, with what? Were you two lovebirds looking to get married? I can tell two people in love when I see them and you two\u2014love,\u201d he said.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>You looked at the stranger next to you at the same moment his eyes met yours. He quirked his lips into an amused smirk, then cleared his throat.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not looking to get married. Can we speak somewhere more private?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and motioned to his right. You and Chris walked the path of the hallway and into an office with the name plaque that said, <i>Richard Morton</i>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Once you walked into the office, you sat in the seats in front of the office desk.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow can I help now?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>You dug into your clutch and took out the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Richard looked at the paper and skimmed the details and nodded every few seconds.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis is a marriage certificate,\u201d Richard asserted.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, we know that much but\u2014,\u201d Chris began before you cut him off.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat he is beating around the bush to ask is; is this for real?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Richard looked between the two of you and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs the marriage certificate real?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. Look, we don\u2019t remember much um, it\u2019s a little embarrassing to admit, but we don\u2019t remember much. We came here to understand why we have this,\u201d Chris explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I can help with that. You have this because you applied for it and it is to validate the union,\u201d Richard clarified.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cValidate?\u201d Chris questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUnion?\u201d You inquired.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Your mouth filled with a bad taste similar to the taste one got before they vomited.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that um, that we\u2014him and I\u2014,\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGot married. Yes, by the looks of this, the certificate has my name and this establishment. You were married here last night.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed as he sunk back into the chair.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You immediately began hyperventilating in the seat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my god. I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>You jumped up and hurried to the closest thing you could find\u2014a garbage can. As you bent everything came up. Within seconds you felt soft, strong hands rest on your waist and lower back and then felt your hair being held back. You could feel his body heat radiating onto yours and smell his intoxicating scent.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere you go, get it all out. Do you have some water, Richard? Maybe a paper towel too?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Richard hurried out the office leaving the two of you there. This was not cute. You felt Chris rub your back in a soothing way, a way that made you shiver.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cAt least he\u2019s not an asshole Vix.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Richard rushed back in with the requested items. As you came upright, Chris held out the paper towel to you for you to wipe your mouth and then passed you the water bottle. You took a sip, swished it around your mouth, gargled the spit into the garbage can.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere. Better?\u201d Chris asked with concern shining through his eyes. You nodded and looked to Richard whose eyes were fixed on the garbage can full of vomit with a disgusted look.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and looked away, then his face lit up.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I remember you two, mainly I remember that tattoo. I\u2019m sorry for not recognizing you sooner, but we marry at least a hundred people a night. I remember you two now. You came in around 3am, and honestly, you both clearly had alcohol in your system, but you swore you knew what you were doing. You couldn\u2019t keep your hands off each other really. Even when you had to separate to get dressed in the garments you found in the boutique, it took nearly fifteen minutes before you separated. We couldn\u2019t get through the ceremony with you trying to kiss each other. My wife was here, and she said she saw something in the two of you, something she says will take you long and far. Anyway, yes, you\u2019re married,\u201d Richard explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You and Chris exchanged looks <g class=\"gr_ gr_565 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"565\" data-gr-id=\"565\">as</g> the final piece of evidence <g class=\"gr_ gr_566 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"566\" data-gr-id=\"566\">was</g> presented. Richard held out a sheet of pictures to the two of you. Chris made no move to take the photo, so you did. When you looked at it there, you stood dressed in a white dress that clearly looked like something from a French costume party. Your arm was draped through Chris\u2019 with your cheek pressed to his. The two of you were smiling widely. Yes, you looked tipsy but not flat out drunk, somehow you looked happy. You looked to the two other pictures; one was of the two of you kissing. Your leg was up, and he was holding you at your thigh. There was not a single space between your bodies. The final picture was the two of you holding your hands up, showing off your new rings.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you groaned slapping your hand to your forehead.</p><p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c805c42e6595a3ed28a783818f1dadd/tumblr_inline_pt9modV9Gb1roq91t_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\"></figure><p><b><i>-Chris-</i></b></p><p>After a very quiet ride back to the hotel, he was pacing the balcony of his penthouse while she was locked in the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t believe the day he was having, couldn\u2019t believe any of this. He came to Vegas with Anthony, Seb, Mike, and Troy to unwind before the next bout of filming he was signed up for in a few weeks. It was his last night before they flew out that night and he chose to go to the casino to try his luck. Now he was married. Married! He stopped his movements and rested his elbows on the railing and peered out over the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. He gripped his head in his hands and groaned out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Married. He\u2019d never thought to ever get married he was having too much fun enjoying his life and being a bachelor. Marriage was not where he was now; it was not what he had written in his cards.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never before made this mistake before. Why now? What was it about this woman? He thought back to last night, but it was still a blank. He didn\u2019t even remember sleeping with her, didn\u2019t remember meeting her, and surely didn\u2019t remember marrying her. He groaned again.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit, mom\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris gripped his head again before he turned away from the view to look into the living room of his penthouse. She was beautiful yes, very beautiful and she had plenty of curves, all the curves he could ever want but never had before. She was gorgeous, there was no denying it, but he\u2019d never fallen victim to a pretty face before. How did he now?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It was then a memory swept over him. She <g class=\"gr_ gr_556 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"556\" data-gr-id=\"556\">was crouched</g> on her hands and knees on the bed with her perfect ass pointed to him. He sat there, admiring her perfect skin and dangerous arch in her back. She peeped back at him, bit her bottom lip and winked. In seconds he approached her and dropped a slap to her ass and dropped his mouth to her opening. She tasted good, like liquor and vanilla. Her moans were instantaneous, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to be the only thing he heard over his own beating heart. He gripped one of her shapely cheeks and quickly moved to the other to place a forceful bite on it. She flung her head back, and her hair whipped the top of his. He groaned and squeezed her flesh and went back to work.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Slowly the memory faded but the effects of the memory lingered. He licked his lips as if he could still taste her. He rubbed his chin and felt everything he felt in that moment. He wanted her. Chris turned his back to the window and looked back out over the horizon and firmly gripped the railing. He needed to get a grip. From inside, he heard the sound of her footsteps and took one final breath before he walked inside.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have to annul this,\u201d Chris began.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He was surprised she did. Usually, women fell all over themselves when it came to him. Most would do anything to be in this situation, he still didn\u2019t understand it, but he didn\u2019t dwell on it. She didn\u2019t seem to be falling all over herself, that intrigued him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe court. If we hurry, we can still catch them,\u201d he said.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Without a <g class=\"gr_ gr_534 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"534\" data-gr-id=\"534\">word</g> she walked to the door and out. Again, he was thrown off, but he followed.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When they arrived at the courts, they were directed to the right floor and room. They filled out the paperwork and waited for their number to be called. The entire time Chris kept his hat tipped down, praying no one would recognize him. The last thing he needed was for this to be splattered all across UsWeekly or on TMZ. After nearly three hours, they approached the clerk\u2019s window.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A woman with grey hair and <g class=\"gr_ gr_605 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"605\" data-gr-id=\"605\">a young</g> face sat behind the thick glass looking at them expectantly; \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He looked at you, and you looked at him; neither of you sure who would do the talking. He stepped forward and pushed the papers under the glass.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019d like to process these for an annulment please,\u201d he explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The woman took the papers skimmed through them and began tapping keys on her computer.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYour names.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked up and stared at him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAs in the actor?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, no relation. I\u2019m a normal guy, plain old Joe,\u201d he lied.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And <g class=\"gr_ gr_522 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"522\" data-gr-id=\"522\">yours</g> sweetheart?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVixen Giovanni.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris looked at her; he\u2019d seen her name on the marriage certificate, but he didn\u2019t actually know her name.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour name\u2019s Vixen?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, long story,\u201d she responded.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right, and the grounds for the annulment?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014well, grounds?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, there are a few. Let me ask a few questions. Since the two of you are over eighteen parental consent is not necessary, that takes one off. Was either of you mentally incapacitated? Either one or both of you didn\u2019t understand what you were doing?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Again you both looked at each other, knowing that answer was no. As if sensing the answer, the clerk drew a line on the paperwork through that option.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFraud? Were either of you coerced into this marriage under false pretenses?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Vixen shook her head, and he followed, again the clerk drew a line through that option.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you two related?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both shook your head no again, and another line was drawn.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWere either of you married to someone else at the time of your marriage?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. Another line.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right that leaves one, was the marriage consummated?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both looked at each other again, and his eyes dipped down, and it was then he saw hickeys on your neck and shoulder. Another memory washed over him. She was sitting on his lap moving her hips hypnotically against him. Her lips were moving tantalizingly slow against his in a searing kiss, a kiss that sucked all air out of his lungs, but he didn\u2019t want to stop. She bit his bottom lip, and he moaned loudly before he gripped her hips and moved her on him. He took control and stood <g class=\"gr_ gr_551 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"551\" data-gr-id=\"551\">holding</g> her against his body. He then dropped her onto the bed and continued thrusting in her. She felt good, too good. Her nails scraping along his back was the last thing he remembered before the memory faded. He cleared his throat loudly and looked away from her.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, it was consummated,\u201d he responded as low as possible.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, unfortunately, an annulment is not possible for the two of you. Those are the grounds, and your situation does not meet any of them,\u201d the clerk explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What are we supposed to do? Vixen asked.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStay married, or file for a proper divorce, the choice is yours. Although he\u2019s a hot one girl why the rush? Hang on to him.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris pinched his lips together and smiled at the compliment.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both walked to the side feeling completely defeated. As you walked out the building, you both stood atop the steps just looking out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can contact my lawyer back in LA, and we\u2019ll get started on the divorce you can come by his office and sign the paperwork. Do you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He looked to her and saw a faraway look on her face, a look of disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVixen,\u201d he said, <g class=\"gr_ gr_521 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"521\" data-gr-id=\"521\">liking</g> the way her name felt on his lips, liking the way he felt saying her name. He shook his head and hoped the feeling shook off as well. She looked to him with a blank look.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDo you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, no.

You looked over his muscular back and shoulders and down to his trim waist. He was beautiful. You could see freckles dusted across his skin and you had a flash of a memory of you kissing across his back and those same freckles. You froze and wrapped yourself in the memory, hoping more would come back. After a few seconds of the <g class=\"gr_ gr_562 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"562\" data-gr-id=\"562\">memory</g> it faded, leaving you frustrated but turned on.

The memory of you kissing across his skin kept flooding your head, and every time it did, you tried to force others to come back, but they didn\u2019t. You were becoming frustrated and annoyed.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOf all the things I want to forget in my life I can\u2019t and the one thing I want to remember I can\u2019t.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>\u00a0</i></p><p>You groaned again and looked next to you at Chris.

You looked around the lobby and turned your lip up. You weren\u2019t disgusted per se, but you were incredibly disappointed this was where you got married.

He quirked his lips into an amused smirk, then cleared his throat.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not looking to get married. Can we speak somewhere more private?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and motioned to his right. You and Chris walked the path of the hallway and into an office with the name plaque that said, <i>Richard Morton</i>.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Once you walked into the office, you sat in the seats in front of the office desk.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cHow can I help now?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>You dug into your clutch and took out the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Richard looked at the paper and skimmed the details and nodded every few seconds.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThis is a marriage certificate,\u201d Richard asserted.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, we know that much but\u2014,\u201d Chris began before you cut him off.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWhat he is beating around the bush to ask is; is this for real?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Richard looked between the two of you and nodded.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIs the marriage certificate real?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes. Look, we don\u2019t remember much um, it\u2019s a little embarrassing to admit, but we don\u2019t remember much. We came here to understand why we have this,\u201d Chris explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I can help with that. You have this because you applied for it and it is to validate the union,\u201d Richard clarified.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cValidate?\u201d Chris questioned.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUnion?\u201d You inquired.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>Your mouth filled with a bad taste similar to the taste one got before they vomited.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that um, that we\u2014him and I\u2014,\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cGot married. Yes, by the looks of this, the certificate has my name and this establishment. You were married here last night.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Chris exclaimed as he sunk back into the chair.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You immediately began hyperventilating in the seat beside him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cOh my god. I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>You jumped up and hurried to the closest thing you could find\u2014a garbage can. As you bent everything came up. Within seconds you felt soft, strong hands rest on your waist and lower back and then felt your hair being held back. You could feel his body heat radiating onto yours and smell his intoxicating scent.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere you go, get it all out. Do you have some water, Richard? Maybe a paper towel too?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Richard hurried out the office leaving the two of you there. This was not cute. You felt Chris rub your back in a soothing way, a way that made you shiver.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cAt least he\u2019s not an asshole Vix.\u201d</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Richard rushed back in with the requested items. As you came upright, Chris held out the paper towel to you for you to wipe your mouth and then passed you the water bottle. You took a sip, swished it around your mouth, gargled the spit into the garbage can.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cThere. Better?\u201d Chris asked with concern shining through his eyes. You nodded and looked to Richard whose eyes were fixed on the garbage can full of vomit with a disgusted look.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>He nodded and looked away, then his face lit up.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh yes, I remember you two, mainly I remember that tattoo. I\u2019m sorry for not recognizing you sooner, but we marry at least a hundred people a night. I remember you two now. You came in around 3am, and honestly, you both clearly had alcohol in your system, but you swore you knew what you were doing. You couldn\u2019t keep your hands off each other really. Even when you had to separate to get dressed in the garments you found in the boutique, it took nearly fifteen minutes before you separated. We couldn\u2019t get through the ceremony with you trying to kiss each other. My wife was here, and she said she saw something in the two of you, something she says will take you long and far. Anyway, yes, you\u2019re married,\u201d Richard explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You and Chris exchanged looks <g class=\"gr_ gr_565 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"565\" data-gr-id=\"565\">as</g> the final piece of evidence <g class=\"gr_ gr_566 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"566\" data-gr-id=\"566\">was</g> presented. Richard held out a sheet of pictures to the two of you. Chris made no move to take the photo, so you did. When you looked at it there, you stood dressed in a white dress that clearly looked like something from a French costume party. Your arm was draped through Chris\u2019 with your cheek pressed to his. The two of you were smiling widely. Yes, you looked tipsy but not flat out drunk, somehow you looked happy. You looked to the two other pictures; one was of the two of you kissing. Your leg was up, and he was holding you at your thigh. There was not a single space between your bodies. The final picture was the two of you holding your hands up, showing off your new rings.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d you groaned slapping your hand to your forehead.</p><p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c805c42e6595a3ed28a783818f1dadd/tumblr_inline_pt9modV9Gb1roq91t_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\"></figure><p><b><i>-Chris-</i></b></p><p>After a very quiet ride back to the hotel, he was pacing the balcony of his penthouse while she was locked in the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t believe the day he was having, couldn\u2019t believe any of this. He came to Vegas with Anthony, Seb, Mike, and Troy to unwind before the next bout of filming he was signed up for in a few weeks. It was his last night before they flew out that night and he chose to go to the casino to try his luck. Now he was married. Married! He stopped his movements and rested his elbows on the railing and peered out over the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. He gripped his head in his hands and groaned out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Married. He\u2019d never thought to ever get married he was having too much fun enjoying his life and being a bachelor. Marriage was not where he was now; it was not what he had written in his cards.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d never before made this mistake before. Why now? What was it about this woman? He thought back to last night, but it was still a blank. He didn\u2019t even remember sleeping with her, didn\u2019t remember meeting her, and surely didn\u2019t remember marrying her. He groaned again.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit, mom\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris gripped his head again before he turned away from the view to look into the living room of his penthouse. She was beautiful yes, very beautiful and she had plenty of curves, all the curves he could ever want but never had before. She was gorgeous, there was no denying it, but he\u2019d never fallen victim to a pretty face before. How did he now?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>It was then a memory swept over him. She <g class=\"gr_ gr_556 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"556\" data-gr-id=\"556\">was crouched</g> on her hands and knees on the bed with her perfect ass pointed to him. He sat there, admiring her perfect skin and dangerous arch in her back. She peeped back at him, bit her bottom lip and winked. In seconds he approached her and dropped a slap to her ass and dropped his mouth to her opening. She tasted good, like liquor and vanilla. Her moans were instantaneous, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to be the only thing he heard over his own beating heart. He gripped one of her shapely cheeks and quickly moved to the other to place a forceful bite on it. She flung her head back, and her hair whipped the top of his. He groaned and squeezed her flesh and went back to work.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Slowly the memory faded but the effects of the memory lingered. He licked his lips as if he could still taste her. He rubbed his chin and felt everything he felt in that moment. He wanted her. Chris turned his back to the window and looked back out over the horizon and firmly gripped the railing. He needed to get a grip. From inside, he heard the sound of her footsteps and took one final breath before he walked inside.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe have to annul this,\u201d Chris began.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>He was surprised she did. Usually, women fell all over themselves when it came to him. Most would do anything to be in this situation, he still didn\u2019t understand it, but he didn\u2019t dwell on it. She didn\u2019t seem to be falling all over herself, that intrigued him.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow do we do that?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe court. If we hurry, we can still catch them,\u201d he said.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Without a <g class=\"gr_ gr_534 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"534\" data-gr-id=\"534\">word</g> she walked to the door and out. Again, he was thrown off, but he followed.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When they arrived at the courts, they were directed to the right floor and room. They filled out the paperwork and waited for their number to be called. The entire time Chris kept his hat tipped down, praying no one would recognize him. The last thing he needed was for this to be splattered all across UsWeekly or on TMZ. After nearly three hours, they approached the clerk\u2019s window.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>A woman with grey hair and <g class=\"gr_ gr_605 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"605\" data-gr-id=\"605\">a young</g> face sat behind the thick glass looking at them expectantly; \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>He looked at you, and you looked at him; neither of you sure who would do the talking. He stepped forward and pushed the papers under the glass.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019d like to process these for an annulment please,\u201d he explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The woman took the papers skimmed through them and began tapping keys on her computer.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYour names.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh, Chris Evans.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The woman looked up and stared at him.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAs in the actor?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo, no relation. I\u2019m a normal guy, plain old Joe,\u201d he lied.</p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And <g class=\"gr_ gr_522 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"522\" data-gr-id=\"522\">yours</g> sweetheart?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVixen Giovanni.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris looked at her; he\u2019d seen her name on the marriage certificate, but he didn\u2019t actually know her name.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour name\u2019s Vixen?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYeah, long story,\u201d she responded.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right, and the grounds for the annulment?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014well, grounds?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, there are a few. Let me ask a few questions. Since the two of you are over eighteen parental consent is not necessary, that takes one off. Was either of you mentally incapacitated? Either one or both of you didn\u2019t understand what you were doing?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Again you both looked at each other, knowing that answer was no. As if sensing the answer, the clerk drew a line on the paperwork through that option.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFraud? Were either of you coerced into this marriage under false pretenses?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Vixen shook her head, and he followed, again the clerk drew a line through that option.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cAre you two related?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both shook your head no again, and another line was drawn.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWere either of you married to someone else at the time of your marriage?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. Another line.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right that leaves one, was the marriage consummated?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both looked at each other again, and his eyes dipped down, and it was then he saw hickeys on your neck and shoulder. Another memory washed over him. She was sitting on his lap moving her hips hypnotically against him. Her lips were moving tantalizingly slow against his in a searing kiss, a kiss that sucked all air out of his lungs, but he didn\u2019t want to stop. She bit his bottom lip, and he moaned loudly before he gripped her hips and moved her on him. He took control and stood <g class=\"gr_ gr_551 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"551\" data-gr-id=\"551\">holding</g> her against his body. He then dropped her onto the bed and continued thrusting in her. She felt good, too good. Her nails scraping along his back was the last thing he remembered before the memory faded. He cleared his throat loudly and looked away from her.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYes, it was consummated,\u201d he responded as low as possible.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, unfortunately, an annulment is not possible for the two of you. Those are the grounds, and your situation does not meet any of them,\u201d the clerk explained.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What are we supposed to do? Vixen asked.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cStay married, or file for a proper divorce, the choice is yours. Although he\u2019s a hot one girl why the rush? Hang on to him.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Chris pinched his lips together and smiled at the compliment.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>You both walked to the side feeling completely defeated. As you walked out the building, you both stood atop the steps just looking out.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can contact my lawyer back in LA, and we\u2019ll get started on the divorce you can come by his office and sign the paperwork. Do you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He looked to her and saw a faraway look on her face, a look of disbelief.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cVixen,\u201d he said, <g class=\"gr_ gr_521 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"521\" data-gr-id=\"521\">liking</g> the way her name felt on his lips, liking the way he felt saying her name. He shook his head and hoped the feeling shook off as well. She looked to him with a blank look.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u201cDo you live in LA?\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUh, no. San Fran,\u201d she responded.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, I can make a detour to LA for a day or two.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAll right, good, then we can get this handled discreetly, my lawyer is the best,\u201d he assured.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>She didn\u2019t look to have heard a word because she walked away with the same look of disbelief on her face. He probably would have the same look, but he refused to let the last twenty-four hours marinate, he refused to allow his foolish actions to seep in.

His eyes roamed over your figure. You weren&rsquo;t shy, never had been. You looked over, and it was then he looked away and turned his back to you. You looked over his muscular back and shoulders and down to his trim waist. He was beautiful. You could see freckles dusted across his skin and you had a flash of a memory of you kissing across his back and those same freckles. You froze and wrapped yourself in the memory, hoping more would come back. After a few seconds of the memory it faded, leaving you frustrated but turned on. When you opened your eyes, he was looking at you. The two of you stood there staring at each other, and you wondered what he was thinking.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chris licked his lips and then asked; &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of pushing you on that bed and having a repeat of last night one that I can&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You shook your head, cleared your throat, and averted your eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.

His eyes flew open, and you felt a gentle but strong push. You stumbled into the elevator just before the doors close. You took a breath and closed your eyes.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Good job Vix, first vacation in two years and you sleep with a stranger and marry him, but not just any stranger, Captain America himself.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You rolled your eyes and impatiently rode the elevator down to the lobby. You tried your best to calm down and not go crazy with thoughts. Once the doors opened, you looked over yourself and tried to ignore the fact you wore <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/pyW6nzP/dress-2.jpg\">last night&rsquo;s sexy dress</a>. It was Vegas after all you wouldn&rsquo;t stand out. You walked into the lobby and looked around, unsure what to do. You walked to the front desk attendant.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me; I&rsquo;m looking for some information. Do you know how to get to The Little White Chapel?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oooh, someone getting married? Congratulations!&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You tried hard not to make a disgusted face.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no marriage, just sightseeing, I hear tons of celebs got married there. I&rsquo;d love to see it,&rdquo; you lied.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, a lot of celebrities have gotten married there. I can have one of the cars prepped to take you there.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s one of the perks of staying with us here.

Yeah. At least my money I well spent.&rdquo; You smiled. Once the lobby attendant looked away, you shook your head.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a few moments, the attendant looked up and smiled.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There, all booked.

During the drive, you kept your eyes glued to the window as your thoughts floated further and further away from the car. The memory of you kissing across his skin kept flooding your head, and every time it did, you tried to force others to come back, but they didn&rsquo;t. You were becoming frustrated and annoyed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Of all the things I want to forget in my life I can&rsquo;t and the one thing I want to remember I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>You groaned again and looked next to you at Chris. He was scrolling through his phone. You looked over his long legs and to the hand that rested atop his knee. You licked your lips as you scanned his long fingers and again a memory flashed in your head. You laid on your back in the bed with his head suckling your breasts and his finger in your mouth. You could remember the sensations his mouth gave you, the chills that ran down your spine and the goosebumps that rose on your skin.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Holy shit!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>You sank your teeth into your bottom lip and allowed another memory to flood you. Your back was arched off the bed, and your head tilted back. Chris was between your legs. The intensity of the pleasure that you remembered hit you like a ton of bricks.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Fuck, Chris Evans eats pussy, and he&rsquo;s good at it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>A big wave of arousal hit you.

You stepped out, and Chris walked around to meet you. As you walked inside, you took in the cheesy d&eacute;cor, and that was all it took for your resting bitch face to change to a horrified look. You looked around the lobby and turned your lip up. You weren&rsquo;t disgusted per se, but you were incredibly disappointed this was where you got married. Before you could look around anymore, a loud booming voice rang out from behind you.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I help you two?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You looked over the tall man with dark to black hair and a bright smile on his face.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yes. We were hoping we could get some information,&rdquo; Chris began.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;All right, with what? Were you two lovebirds looking to get married? I can tell two people in love when I see them and you two&mdash;love,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You looked at the stranger next to you at the same moment his eyes met yours. He quirked his lips into an amused smirk, then cleared his throat.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not looking to get married. Can we speak somewhere more private?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He nodded and motioned to his right. You and Chris walked the path of the hallway and into an office with the name plaque that said, <i>Richard Morton</i>.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Once you walked into the office, you sat in the seats in front of the office desk.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;How can I help now?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You dug into your clutch and took out the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Richard looked at the paper and skimmed the details and nodded every few seconds.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;This is a marriage certificate,&rdquo; Richard asserted.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that much but&mdash;,&rdquo; Chris began before you cut him off.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;What he is beating around the bush to ask is; is this for real?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Richard looked between the two of you and nodded.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is the marriage certificate real?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Look, we don&rsquo;t remember much um, it&rsquo;s a little embarrassing to admit, but we don&rsquo;t remember much.

Yes, by the looks of this, the certificate has my name and this establishment. You were married here last night.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh fuck!&rdquo; Chris exclaimed as he sunk back into the chair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You immediately began hyperventilating in the seat beside him.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god. I think I&rsquo;m gonna be sick.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You jumped up and hurried to the closest thing you could find&mdash;a garbage can. As you bent everything came up. Within seconds you felt soft, strong hands rest on your waist and lower back and then felt your hair being held back. You could feel his body heat radiating onto yours and smell his intoxicating scent.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There you go, get it all out. Do you have some water, Richard? Maybe a paper towel too?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Richard hurried out the office leaving the two of you there. This was not cute. You felt Chris rub your back in a soothing way, a way that made you shiver.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;At least he&rsquo;s not an asshole Vix.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Richard rushed back in with the requested items. As you came upright, Chris held out the paper towel to you for you to wipe your mouth and then passed you the water bottle. You took a sip, swished it around your mouth, gargled the spit into the garbage can.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;There. Better?&rdquo; Chris asked with concern shining through his eyes. You nodded and looked to Richard whose eyes were fixed on the garbage can full of vomit with a disgusted look.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>He nodded and looked away, then his face lit up.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah yes, I remember you two, mainly I remember that tattoo. I&rsquo;m sorry for not recognizing you sooner, but we marry at least a hundred people a night. I remember you two now. You came in around 3am, and honestly, you both clearly had alcohol in your system, but you swore you knew what you were doing. You couldn&rsquo;t keep your hands off each other really. Even when you had to separate to get dressed in the garments you found in the boutique, it took nearly fifteen minutes before you separated. We couldn&rsquo;t get through the ceremony with you trying to kiss each other. My wife was here, and she said she saw something in the two of you, something she says will take you long and far. Anyway, yes, you&rsquo;re married,&rdquo; Richard explained.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You and Chris exchanged looks as the final piece of evidence was presented. Richard held out a sheet of pictures to the two of you. Chris made no move to take the photo, so you did. When you looked at it there, you stood dressed in a white dress that clearly looked like something from a French costume party. Your arm was draped through Chris&rsquo; with your cheek pressed to his. The two of you were smiling widely. Yes, you looked tipsy but not flat out drunk, somehow you looked happy. You looked to the two other pictures; one was of the two of you kissing. Your leg was up, and he was holding you at your thigh. There was not a single space between your bodies. The final picture was the two of you holding your hands up, showing off your new rings.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; you groaned slapping your hand to your forehead.</p><p><b>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c805c42e6595a3ed28a783818f1dadd/tumblr_inline_pt9modV9Gb1roq91t_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b><i>-Chris-</i></b></p><p>After a very quiet ride back to the hotel, he was pacing the balcony of his penthouse while she was locked in the bathroom. He couldn&rsquo;t believe the day he was having, couldn&rsquo;t believe any of this. He came to Vegas with Anthony, Seb, Mike, and Troy to unwind before the next bout of filming he was signed up for in a few weeks. It was his last night before they flew out that night and he chose to go to the casino to try his luck. Now he was married. Married! He stopped his movements and rested his elbows on the railing and peered out over the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. He gripped his head in his hands and groaned out.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Married. He&rsquo;d never thought to ever get married he was having too much fun enjoying his life and being a bachelor. Marriage was not where he was now; it was not what he had written in his cards.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This is a bad idea.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d never before made this mistake before. Why now? What was it about this woman? He thought back to last night, but it was still a blank. He didn&rsquo;t even remember sleeping with her, didn&rsquo;t remember meeting her, and surely didn&rsquo;t remember marrying her. He groaned again.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit, mom&rsquo;s gonna kill me.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chris gripped his head again before he turned away from the view to look into the living room of his penthouse. She was beautiful yes, very beautiful and she had plenty of curves, all the curves he could ever want but never had before. She was gorgeous, there was no denying it, but he&rsquo;d never fallen victim to a pretty face before. How did he now?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was then a memory swept over him. She was crouched on her hands and knees on the bed with her perfect ass pointed to him. He sat there, admiring her perfect skin and dangerous arch in her back. She peeped back at him, bit her bottom lip and winked. In seconds he approached her and dropped a slap to her ass and dropped his mouth to her opening. She tasted good, like liquor and vanilla. Her moans were instantaneous, and it didn&rsquo;t take long for them to be the only thing he heard over his own beating heart. He gripped one of her shapely cheeks and quickly moved to the other to place a forceful bite on it. She flung her head back, and her hair whipped the top of his. He groaned and squeezed her flesh and went back to work.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Slowly the memory faded but the effects of the memory lingered. He licked his lips as if he could still taste her. He rubbed his chin and felt everything he felt in that moment. He wanted her. Chris turned his back to the window and looked back out over the horizon and firmly gripped the railing. He needed to get a grip. From inside, he heard the sound of her footsteps and took one final breath before he walked inside.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to annul this,&rdquo; Chris began.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He was surprised she did. Usually, women fell all over themselves when it came to him. Most would do anything to be in this situation, he still didn&rsquo;t understand it, but he didn&rsquo;t dwell on it. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be falling all over herself, that intrigued him.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How do we do that?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The court. If we hurry, we can still catch them,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without a word she walked to the door and out. Again, he was thrown off, but he followed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>When they arrived at the courts, they were directed to the right floor and room. They filled out the paperwork and waited for their number to be called. The entire time Chris kept his hat tipped down, praying no one would recognize him. The last thing he needed was for this to be splattered all across UsWeekly or on TMZ. After nearly three hours, they approached the clerk&rsquo;s window.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A woman with grey hair and a young face sat behind the thick glass looking at them expectantly; &ldquo;How can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He looked at you, and you looked at him; neither of you sure who would do the talking. He stepped forward and pushed the papers under the glass.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d like to process these for an annulment please,&rdquo; he explained.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The woman took the papers skimmed through them and began tapping keys on her computer.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Your names.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh, Chris Evans.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The woman looked up and stared at him.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;As in the actor?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, no relation. I&rsquo;m a normal guy, plain old Joe,&rdquo; he lied.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uh-huh. And yours sweetheart?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Vixen Giovanni.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chris looked at her; he&rsquo;d seen her name on the marriage certificate, but he didn&rsquo;t actually know her name.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s Vixen?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, long story,&rdquo; she responded.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, and the grounds for the annulment?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&mdash;well, grounds?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there are a few. Let me ask a few questions. Since the two of you are over eighteen parental consent is not necessary, that takes one off. Was either of you mentally incapacitated? Either one or both of you didn&rsquo;t understand what you were doing?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again you both looked at each other, knowing that answer was no. As if sensing the answer, the clerk drew a line on the paperwork through that option.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fraud? Were either of you coerced into this marriage under false pretenses?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Vixen shook her head, and he followed, again the clerk drew a line through that option.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you two related?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You both shook your head no again, and another line was drawn.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Were either of you married to someone else at the time of your marriage?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he responded. Another line.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All right that leaves one, was the marriage consummated?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You both looked at each other again, and his eyes dipped down, and it was then he saw hickeys on your neck and shoulder. Another memory washed over him. She was sitting on his lap moving her hips hypnotically against him. Her lips were moving tantalizingly slow against his in a searing kiss, a kiss that sucked all air out of his lungs, but he didn&rsquo;t want to stop. She bit his bottom lip, and he moaned loudly before he gripped her hips and moved her on him. He took control and stood holding her against his body. He then dropped her onto the bed and continued thrusting in her. She felt good, too good. Her nails scraping along his back was the last thing he remembered before the memory faded. He cleared his throat loudly and looked away from her.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was consummated,&rdquo; he responded as low as possible.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, unfortunately, an annulment is not possible for the two of you. Those are the grounds, and your situation does not meet any of them,&rdquo; the clerk explained.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean? What are we supposed to do? Vixen asked.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Stay married, or file for a proper divorce, the choice is yours. Although he&rsquo;s a hot one girl why the rush? Hang on to him.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chris pinched his lips together and smiled at the compliment.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Next.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You both walked to the side feeling completely defeated. As you walked out the building, you both stood atop the steps just looking out.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can contact my lawyer back in LA, and we&rsquo;ll get started on the divorce you can come by his office and sign the paperwork. Do you live in LA?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>She didn&rsquo;t answer. He looked to her and saw a faraway look on her face, a look of disbelief.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Vixen,&rdquo; he said, liking the way her name felt on his lips, liking the way he felt saying her name. He shook his head and hoped the feeling shook off as well. She looked to him with a blank look.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Do you live in LA?&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, no. San Fran,&rdquo; she responded.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, I can make a detour to LA for a day or two.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All right, good, then we can get this handled discreetly, my lawyer is the best,&rdquo; he assured.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>She didn&rsquo;t look to have heard a word because she walked away with the same look of disbelief on her face. He probably would have the same look, but he refused to let the last twenty-four hours marinate, he refused to allow his foolish actions to seep in. He refused to allow the voice of his mother or father infiltrate his brain. If he did, he knew he&rsquo;d look just like her.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>TagList:</b></p><p><br /></p><p>@sarahboseman <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtVJSemJlAShWpR9gsdxIXg\">@heyauntieeee</a> @airis-paris14 @thiccdaddy-mbaku\n@wakandas-vibranium @wakanda-inspired @theunsweetenedtruth\n@ashanti-notthesinger @reignsxjackson @halfrican-heat @ambthegamer\n@simplyyamberr @muse-of-mbaku @sisterwifeudaku @mejustme06 @ilcb7\n@leahnicole1219 &nbsp;@destinio1 @maliadestiny @drsunshine97 @blowmymbackout\n@purplehairgawdess @thehuntoyobun @wakandamama @wakandawinning @profilia\n@zxddy-panther @h-challa @babygirlofwakanda @misswakanda2018 @challaxkillmonger\n@ororowrites @hutchj @myfavemarvelfanfics @lavitabella87\n@afraiddreamingandloving @autumn242 @purple-apricots @skysynclair19\n@hersheyskissesss-blog @blue-ishx @blublubleu <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m62lZQNIjQ207syE6kuhpTQ\">@90sinspiredgirl</a>\n&nbsp;@tchallaswife @tchallamakesmeh0lla @turn-thy-paige @blackchickfics\n@blackpantherismyish @inlovewithmakeupcomicsanimelove @naturally-bri\n@flawlesslybeautiful14 @qweentbh @lunaerly @theoutereffect\n@twilight-sapphire-lover @pupyluv247 @stark-red19 @cockyboysandsugarism\n@maverickabull @madbadsiren @aykanna @myaw731 @ruruly20 @mixedmelanin\n@brittyevans @bezzywazhere @laketaj24 @taint3dvirgin @soulsparker\n@theresnomoregoodones @syreanne @loveandcigarillos &nbsp;@heybriheyyy @wakanda-bcth\n@uhlxis @yaachtynoboat711 @geeksareunique @bultalongthewayside @ajspencer1892\n@captiansaveasmut @imaginewhoever @terrablaze514 @starsshines-blog\n@scrumptiouslytenaciouscrusade @darkandlovely94 @sithlordslut @wavyyc\n@naturalistamisslyn @nigarachi15 @madamslayyy @blackandfair @kreolemami\n@mylastnameisthe-fish @kaykay0829 @chaneajoyyy @tequilajay27\n@blacklotus-of-the-black-kingdom @slimmiyagi @im5ftbutmythroat66 @jaeee-http\n@madhatterhelsing <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/miy4YUE1W_jRIn7ertQY3EQ\">@sunflowerpsalms</a>\n@wakanda-shit-is-that @deliciousstreetkidcroissant @jecourt @vebner37\n@disneysdarlingdiva @melaninmarvel @alanastormborn @dolphinpink310 @wonderbell\n@ohleucothea @queentearra @bitchbetterhavemydinner @fentybabyy @kaykay4454fan\n@priya212 @kitkit1690 @chrismarcs @beautycomesindifferentformsworld\n@blackpantherimagines @ovohanna24 @sweetpeachjones @kslo000 @nubian-queen18\n@omgsuperstarg &nbsp;@prettyprincessushio @treeondrea &nbsp;@ursapharoh05\n&nbsp;@blackpinup22 @kaytauru @big3gocandykahn @kissingpineapples @wildaboutchrisevans\n@fitfineandstayingalive @misspooh @michele-onel @gorjiss @muva-milaje\n@limbo-limbo-limbo @awkwardlyabstract @blxck-brxndie &nbsp;@meeky-imagines\n@inlovewith3 @metalarmlover @mellowjellow6 @sweettea-and-honeybutter\n@thatrandomhetaliachick @missdeerstalker15 @marvelheaux\n@romanceoftheeveryday-blog @mufasathatniggatho @cltex84 @sweetbearcolorgarden\n@msincognito67 @mosagram @mar-ta-3 @ljstraightnochaser @lewatigress\n@akimi-youngblood &nbsp;@bekahdean87 @teechallas-blog @jasmindaughteroftheworld\n@cocooned-butterfly @emoniclark22 @chereedrop619 @theblulife @niggarachi15 &nbsp;@great-neckpectations\n&nbsp;@avenger-marvel-fan @arieljamiyla @vibranium-soul @apileofmiscsomethings\n@niecey4cocaine <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfXDGMr8OjRFSKdiRGhg9nQ\">@missumuch1918</a>\n@chillavesss @heynessss @shamelessqueenobservation @cetouna\n@cosmicmelaninflower &nbsp;@tntnv @dopegalkk @babyblowomg\n@somansystars-and-westillstarve @determinednot2fall @zoezoe34 @chasingsunlight @somanystars-and-westillstarve\n@diamyyyyy @kumkaniudaku <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMskMXgAlLt36T6DC5fvuww\">@give-me-a-million-dollars-pls</a>\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFyvRXb9nWLPECVC3HxnKLw\">@shyblackgirl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbaJs0FogkED0K1cIDEDszQ\">@your-resident-evil</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCN9H075VBhzRbKm0QyrCnQ\">@stillevansbae</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8eeWDMU0PXerp8hisHG3Qg\">@sheisexcellent</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maTULSSOvLRt3Kz3L0gZfmw\">@oceanscorazon</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mNQzLGtsY8q_oRbA3i3flxQ\">@hautehoneyfitness</a>\n@bistoolada <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCHVTyyDyXrLHQRiYEINTfw\">@sunigyrl</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/maGYB3QPyE62f6TEZpQqTSg\">@igotmadskills</a> @adifferentme\n@bugngiz @mellowcyclepuppy @wellthirsted @caramara3&#8203; @pananegra&#8203;&#8203; @amethyst09&#8203;&#8203;\n@champagnesugamama&#8203;</p><p><br /></p><p><b>NOTE: I&rsquo;ve cleaned the taglist up a bit.
