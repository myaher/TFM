Nothing is really changed in the future, I just couldn\u2019t get this idea of a backstory out of my head. (this is the sad fic I mentioned yesterday)</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cSon!\u201d An angry women&rsquo;s harsh voice snapped at her child, calling him to her side, \u201cWhat on Earth did you think you were doing?!\u201d She hissed at the young man.<br/></p><p>\u201cI was just talking to the other boy, mother.\u201d The child fiddled with the ends of his coat, looking sadly at the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat child is a peasant! He&rsquo;s beneath us!\u201d She scoffed and grabbed his child by the wrist, \u201cYou just never talk to anyone like that again, understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mother\u2026\u201d The child winced at how hard his arm was grabbed but did not pull away, not even when his mother began to drag him off. From over his shoulder, the child could see the poor boy who watched them leave and stared apologetically.</p><p>The beggar boy turned back to his own mother, who seemed a lot nicer than the rich boy\u2019s mother, and he hugged her arm. The rich boy watched them until he could no longer see them.</p><p>Joxter woke up from the dream, laying in his tent in the early morning, blinking up at the small bits of sunlight that crept inside. He rolled onto his side and forced himself to stand.</p><p>\u201cGuess it&rsquo;s that time of year, huh?\u201d He said to only himself.</p><p>Joxter stood up and stretched his weary bones, his joints popped and cracked, then settled. He placed his lovely red hat on top of his unruly hair and stepped out into the morning light, yawning as the sun hit his face.</p><p>He started his fire and set some water to boil, catching sight of his tired reflection. Bags hung under his blue eyes, which seemed duller that morning. Had he really slept that bad that night? He blinked and rubbed his eyes, then splashed water from the river onto his face. He didn&rsquo;t want the others to see him looking so miserable.</p><p>When his morning routine was done, he began to amble along the path towards Moominhouse, his back slowly straightening and his face brightening, he really didn&rsquo;t want them to see his miserable like that.</p><p>This always happened, he&rsquo;d spend the whole year just fine, then suddenly, he&rsquo;d dream about them and have to remember that life. He hated that life and just thinking back to it made him miserable.</p><p>Joxter had been told once, that he had to tell people his problems, or they wouldn&rsquo;t get better, but he didn&rsquo;t like worrying people so he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He stopped at the bridge and looked over to his son\u2019s tent, he could barely see inside, but it was enough to know that Snufkin wasn&rsquo;t in there.</p><p>\u201cMust&rsquo;ve gone inside\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself and made his way up to Moominhouse, taking a deep breath before he barged in, in his usual chaotic manner.</p><p>Nothing seemed to be amiss with anyone, he lifted Snufkin&rsquo;s hat and messed up his hair before dropping it back on his head, Snufkin swatted at his hands in an attempt to keep him away.</p><p>He flopped down into a chair and looked at the children, who were all eating their breakfast and talking amongst themselves. Shutting his eyes and basking in how calm it was.</p><p>The young Snorkmaiden walked in, her face was twisted up to show that she was rather frustrated, not that Joxter saw it, since his eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s the matter, Snorkmaiden?\u201d Little My asked before shoving almost an entire pancake into her mouth somehow.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s Snork\u2026\u201d She sighed and sat down, \u201cHe&rsquo;s become frustrated with his work again\u2026 He can&rsquo;t come up with any ideas\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s he do for a living?\u201d Joxter asked without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, he&rsquo;s an engineer, \u201d Snorkmaiden answered, she hadn&rsquo;t actually noticed the Joxter, \u201che does a lot of inventing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn engineer you say?\u201d He blinked one eye open then sat up to look at her, he seemed very happy to learn of an engineer, \u201cWhat&rsquo;s he like working on the most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis flying ship of course, \u201d She beamed, very proud of how hard her brother works, \u201cWhy are you interested, are you an engineer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, no!\u201d Moominpapa interrupted with a laugh, as he walked into the room \u201cI&rsquo;m not even sure if Joxter can read!\u201d</p><p>Joxter wasn&rsquo;t one for glaring, especially not at people he liked, like Moominpapa, however today he found himself glaring very hard at his dear friend.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can read!\u201d He hissed, \u201cI have a degree you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain with this degree!\u201d Moominpapa wasn&rsquo;t being mean, he was joking around with the Joxter, \u201cIf you really have one, how come we&rsquo;ve never seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;ve left it with Mymble! It&rsquo;s far too cumbersome to carry it around on my travels!\u201d Joxter was sitting up fully and was in a very alert state.</p><p>\u201cHow convenient.\u201d Moominpapa chuckled, his tone was playful, and he really did mean no harm, but the Joxter did not seem to realize that.</p><p>He bit his lip in a way that would keep him from shouting something very nasty and stood up. He pushed his chair in, in a rough manner (he still wanted to be polite, but he was very angry) and stormed right out of Moominhouse. Moominpapa went to the window to watch him leave, he seemed very confused by this before.</p><p>\u201cThis is hardly the first time that&rsquo;s been joked about, \u201d he tapped his chin, \u201cand he&rsquo;s always laughed on with us.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin started at the door his father left through, then looked back to his friends, who all seemed to share the confusion. Joxter didn&rsquo;t really ever get angry with people, and if he found himself getting really angry he&rsquo;d excuse himself from the room, and never show how angry he was. </p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;d hate to think that we had been bothering him this whole time with that and he never said anything\u2026\u201d Moominpapa sounded regretful.</p><p>Little My turned to her brother and shrugged, \u201cYou know, I&rsquo;ve seen the degree before, it&rsquo;s hanging on momma&rsquo;s wall, in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Snufkin tilted his head, he didn&rsquo;t think his father was the studious type.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u201d she nodded \u201cit&rsquo;s from\u2026.\u201d She paused and her face scrunched up as she began to think, \u201csomeplace called States-worth University\u2026 I think\u2026\u201d</p><p>Snufkin looked extremely shocked, and he dropped his fork from his hand. He traveled all around, and he knew a lot of things about all sorts of places, he knew exactly what kind of place States-worth was. He suddenly stood up and began to rush out of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Moomintroll called out to him.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask my papa something!\u201d Snufkin called back, \u201cI&rsquo;ll return later!\u201d</p><p>He hurried across the bridge and along the river bank until he came to his father&rsquo;s campsite, he slid to a stop and caught his breath. Listening carefully. He heard a shuffling inside his father&rsquo;s tent, and he knew Joxter was here.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d He walked to the tent&rsquo;s entrance, \u201cAre you there?\u201d He just had to be sure.</p><p>There was a long pause before Joxter finally answered with a tired \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Snufkin sat down outside of the tent, and didn&rsquo;t force his way inside, \u201cWhy did you get mad at Moominpappa?\u201d</p><p>Joxter frowned and rolled onto his back, staring up at the sky, \u201cI just\u2026. It&rsquo;s only that\u2026 well\u2026 no, I don&rsquo;t think I can explain it\u2026 It&rsquo;s stupid anyway.\u201d</p><p>He covered his face with his arm and hoped that Snufkin would be satisfied with that answer.</p><p>Snufkin thought about what he wanted to say next, then asked another question, \u201cDid you really do to States-worth University?\u201d He asked, his tone was low.</p><p>Joxter sat up quickly and struggled to find a response, he wasn&rsquo;t sure how Snufkin found out about this and he really didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He panicked a little before squeezing his eyes hit and taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is one of the most prestigious schools, ever, only extremely well-off families can get in there!\u201d Snufkin said to him, he was shocked before he had thought that Little My had only been messing with him, not telling the truth, but there was the truth all laid out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Joxter covered his face with his hands and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you go there?\u201d Snufkin pressed, leaning forward a bit.</p><p>Joxter opened the flap of his tent, and Snufkin leaned back in surprise, his father looked exhausted, \u201cFine. I&rsquo;ll tell you\u2026 It&rsquo;s your family too I suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>He motioned for Snufkin to come in and Snufkin slowly crawled inside. Sitting across from his sad looking father.</p><p>\u201cMy parents, your grandparents, were an extremely well off family. Extremely well off.\u201d Joxter sighed and leaned his face on his hand, \u201cGrowing up I went to all of the best schools there were, what a coincidence that they were all boarding schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Snufkin nodded and glanced around at his father now, it was hard to imagine he had once been rich.</p><p>\u201cI never saw much of my mother or father, since every time I graduated from one school, I was shipped off to a new one.\u201d He stared blankly at the ground, scratching marks into the dirt with the hand not supporting his head, \u201cAnd when I was on break and back home, my parents just dragged me around to every fancy social gathering they could. So they could put me on a pedestal and show off how talented I was.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin watched him, he didn&rsquo;t press his father to keep speaking, in fact, he figured Joxter was done there, but when he looked at Joxter&rsquo;s eyes, he saw there was way more that needed to be said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn&rsquo;t care about me, Snufkin. They just wanted a child that would make their family look good, and when I wasn&rsquo;t exactly what they wanted they\u2026.\u201d He trailed off, his hands stopped moving, \u201cthey\u2026\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, he really hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about this, and he found it hard to say, \u201cThey\u2026 Threw me out\u2026 Their own son\u2026\u201d He covered his eyes with his hands and leaned his elbows on his knees. He shook his head.</p><p>A silence filled the tent, neither of them knew what they could say. It felt like there was nothing to be said. Snufkin reached over and placed a hand on his papa&rsquo;s hand, suddenly removing Joxter that it was his son he was speaking too. When he lifted his head, Snufkin removed his hand and tried to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry\u2026\u201d Joxter shook his head again, his breath was shaky, and he didn&rsquo;t want any of this to show.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d Snufkin asked perplexed \u201cI&rsquo;m the one who brought it up. I should apologize to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I&rsquo;m not apologizing about all of, \u201d he gestured vaguely around himself, \u201cthis! I&rsquo;m apologizing to you. I should have done it sooner.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin still didn&rsquo;t really understand, and it showed on his face. When Joxter vaguely gestured to Snufkin, the confusion remained. Joxter sighed and rubber this face again.</p><p>\u201cYour life?\u201d He finally said, and it seemed to click fully for Snufkin on what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize for that, I&rsquo;m very happy!\u201d Snufkin beamed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou grew up alone. In the woods. With no family.\u201d Joxter reminded him, not that Snufkin really needed reminding, he just didn&rsquo;t want to bring that up.</p><p>Snufkin frowned, folding his arms, \u201cYes. I did. Did it happen on purpose?\u201d He had suddenly turned to a more cold look, worried that his old fears would come true.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Joxter snapped to look at him, seemingly horrified that Snufkin would suggest that.</p><p>\u201cWell, then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taking you out for a while, for a camping trip.\u201d He began to explain, \u201cYou never liked Mymble&rsquo;s house, it was always too loud for you, so I tried to get you out and about as often as I could.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, curious as to where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cWe were in a small boat on a river, I always liked to find new places to camp.\u201d He smiled fondly at the idea of finding somewhere new to be, the smile faded as he remembered the rest of the story, \u201cThe current picked up\u2026 I tried to get us out of there, but I couldn&rsquo;t. The boat overturned on a rock, I went under water\u2026 And by the time I came up again, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. Not even the boat.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin didn&rsquo;t look so cold anymore, just sad now. He always wanted to know why he didn&rsquo;t grow up in a nice safe home, and of course, he always knew the story wouldn&rsquo;t be a good one, yet still, he wished it had been nicer to hear.</p><p>He fiddled with his own hands and stared at the dirt, \u201cDid you look for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, \u201d the Joxter closed his eyes, \u201cthat&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t go back to the Mymble. I didn&rsquo;t want to ever return until I found you. Then one day the Muddler and Hodgkins found me and said they were going to see Moominpapa and his family, and well, you were there when we showed up.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin smiled, \u201cI liked hearing all of Moominpapa&rsquo;s stories about you, but it was much nicer to put a face to your name, papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, how sweet.\u201d The Joxter said in a joking tone. Then he took a deep breath and laid down, \u201cYou know, I haven&rsquo;t actually told anyone about my past, up until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Snufkin asked curiously, though he then realized that he shouldn&rsquo;t pry so much, \u00a0he quickly came to the regretful conclusion that he had already pried too much.</p><p>Joxter shrugged and found it hard to answer, he searched for a bit before coming to a conclusion, \u201cI guess, I&rsquo;m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone knows exactly how I was raised, and that I&rsquo;m supposed to be fancy and proper, they might get good expectations of me.\u201d His face was serious, \u201cI can&rsquo;t have people expecting me to be decent! Then I can&rsquo;t sleep all day!\u201d his serious look broke away into a huge smile, and he began to laugh.</p><p>Snufkin rolled his eyes and laughed a bit too, \u201cOkay, okay, what&rsquo;s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the real reason!\u201d Joxter sat up and looked at him, still with a huge smile on his face, \u201cIf people don&rsquo;t expect much from me then I can&rsquo;t ever disappoint them, and they won&rsquo;t ever make me leave!\u201d</p><p>Snufkin paused, quickly dissecting that sentence in his head, then looking at the Joxter in surprise. Joxter just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I&rsquo;m gonna grab my degree from Mymble&rsquo;s house, so I can rub it in Moominpapa&rsquo;s face!\u201d he quickly left the tent and began marching in the direction on Mymble&rsquo;s house, and Snufkin followed him quickly.</p><p>\u201cPapa wait, \u201d Snufkin grabbed his wrist, and Joxter turned to look at him, \u201cYou know none of us will ever send you away right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won&rsquo;t.\u201d Snufkin said in a very sad tone, his wanted Joxter to know it and not forget it, \u201cFamily doesn&rsquo;t kick family out. A real family will help you and support you. That&rsquo;s what Moominmama&rsquo;s taught me.\u201d He quickly wrapped Joxter in a big hug and squeezed him as tight as he could.</p><p>Joxter smiled peacefully and gently hugged Snufkin back, \u201cI know that\u2026\u201d</p>",

Extremely well off.\u201d Joxter sighed and leaned his face on his hand, \u201cGrowing up I went to all of the best schools there were, what a coincidence that they were all boarding schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Snufkin nodded and glanced around at his father now, it was hard to imagine he had once been rich.</p><p>\u201cI never saw much of my mother or father, since every time I graduated from one school, I was shipped off to a new one.\u201d He stared blankly at the ground, scratching marks into the dirt with the hand not supporting his head, \u201cAnd when I was on break and back home, my parents just dragged me around to every fancy social gathering they could. So they could put me on a pedestal and show off how talented I was.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin watched him, he didn\u2019t press his father to keep speaking, in fact, he figured Joxter was done there, but when he looked at Joxter\u2019s eyes, he saw there was way more that needed to be said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t care about me, Snufkin. They just wanted a child that would make their family look good, and when I wasn\u2019t exactly what they wanted they\u2026.\u201d He trailed off, his hands stopped moving, \u201cthey\u2026\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, he really hadn\u2019t told anyone about this, and he found it hard to say, \u201cThey\u2026 Threw me out\u2026 Their own son\u2026\u201d He covered his eyes with his hands and leaned his elbows on his knees. He shook his head.</p><p>A silence filled the tent, neither of them knew what they could say. It felt like there was nothing to be said. Snufkin reached over and placed a hand on his papa\u2019s hand, suddenly removing Joxter that it was his son he was speaking too. When he lifted his head, Snufkin removed his hand and tried to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Joxter shook his head again, his breath was shaky, and he didn\u2019t want any of this to show.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d Snufkin asked perplexed \u201cI\u2019m the one who brought it up. I should apologize to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not apologizing about all of, \u201d he gestured vaguely around himself, \u201cthis! I\u2019m apologizing to you. I should have done it sooner.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin still didn\u2019t really understand, and it showed on his face. When Joxter vaguely gestured to Snufkin, the confusion remained. Joxter sighed and rubber this face again.</p><p>\u201cYour life?\u201d He finally said, and it seemed to click fully for Snufkin on what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize for that, I\u2019m very happy!\u201d Snufkin beamed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou grew up alone. In the woods. With no family.\u201d Joxter reminded him, not that Snufkin really needed reminding, he just didn\u2019t want to bring that up.</p><p>Snufkin frowned, folding his arms, \u201cYes. I did. Did it happen on purpose?\u201d He had suddenly turned to a more cold look, worried that his old fears would come true.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Joxter snapped to look at him, seemingly horrified that Snufkin would suggest that.</p><p>\u201cWell, then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taking you out for a while, for a camping trip.\u201d He began to explain, \u201cYou never liked Mymble\u2019s house, it was always too loud for you, so I tried to get you out and about as often as I could.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, curious as to where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cWe were in a small boat on a river, I always liked to find new places to camp.\u201d He smiled fondly at the idea of finding somewhere new to be, the smile faded as he remembered the rest of the story, \u201cThe current picked up\u2026 I tried to get us out of there, but I couldn\u2019t. The boat overturned on a rock, I went under water\u2026 And by the time I came up again, I couldn\u2019t find anything. Not even the boat.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin didn\u2019t look so cold anymore, just sad now. He always wanted to know why he didn\u2019t grow up in a nice safe home, and of course, he always knew the story wouldn\u2019t be a good one, yet still, he wished it had been nicer to hear.</p><p>He fiddled with his own hands and stared at the dirt, \u201cDid you look for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, \u201d the Joxter closed his eyes, \u201cthat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go back to the Mymble. I didn\u2019t want to ever return until I found you. Then one day the Muddler and Hodgkins found me and said they were going to see Moominpapa and his family, and well, you were there when we showed up.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin smiled, \u201cI liked hearing all of Moominpapa\u2019s stories about you, but it was much nicer to put a face to your name, papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, how sweet.\u201d The Joxter said in a joking tone. Then he took a deep breath and laid down, \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t actually told anyone about my past, up until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Snufkin asked curiously, though he then realized that he shouldn\u2019t pry so much, \u00a0he quickly came to the regretful conclusion that he had already pried too much.</p><p>Joxter shrugged and found it hard to answer, he searched for a bit before coming to a conclusion, \u201cI guess, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone knows exactly how I was raised, and that I\u2019m supposed to be fancy and proper, they might get good expectations of me.\u201d His face was serious, \u201cI can\u2019t have people expecting me to be decent! Then I can\u2019t sleep all day!\u201d his serious look broke away into a huge smile, and he began to laugh.</p><p>Snufkin rolled his eyes and laughed a bit too, \u201cOkay, okay, what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the real reason!\u201d Joxter sat up and looked at him, still with a huge smile on his face, \u201cIf people don\u2019t expect much from me then I can\u2019t ever disappoint them, and they won\u2019t ever make me leave!\u201d</p><p>Snufkin paused, quickly dissecting that sentence in his head, then looking at the Joxter in surprise. Joxter just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m gonna grab my degree from Mymble\u2019s house, so I can rub it in Moominpapa\u2019s face!\u201d he quickly left the tent and began marching in the direction on Mymble\u2019s house, and Snufkin followed him quickly.</p><p>\u201cPapa wait, \u201d Snufkin grabbed his wrist, and Joxter turned to look at him, \u201cYou know none of us will ever send you away right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d Snufkin said in a very sad tone, his wanted Joxter to know it and not forget it, \u201cFamily doesn\u2019t kick family out. A real family will help you and support you. That\u2019s what Moominmama\u2019s taught me.\u201d He quickly wrapped Joxter in a big hug and squeezed him as tight as he could.</p><p>Joxter smiled peacefully and gently hugged Snufkin back, \u201cI know that\u2026\u201d</p>",

Nothing is really changed in the future, I just couldn\u2019t get this idea of a backstory out of my head. (this is the sad fic I mentioned yesterday)</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cSon!\u201d An angry women\u2019s harsh voice snapped at her child, calling him to her side, \u201cWhat on Earth did you think you were doing?!\u201d She hissed at the young man.<br></p><p>\u201cI was just talking to the other boy, mother.\u201d The child fiddled with the ends of his coat, looking sadly at the ground.</p><p>\u201cThat child is a peasant! He\u2019s beneath us!\u201d She scoffed and grabbed his child by the wrist, \u201cYou just never talk to anyone like that again, understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mother\u2026\u201d The child winced at how hard his arm was grabbed but did not pull away, not even when his mother began to drag him off. From over his shoulder, the child could see the poor boy who watched them leave and stared apologetically.</p><p>The beggar boy turned back to his own mother, who seemed a lot nicer than the rich boy\u2019s mother, and he hugged her arm. The rich boy watched them until he could no longer see them.</p><p>Joxter woke up from the dream, laying in his tent in the early morning, blinking up at the small bits of sunlight that crept inside. He rolled onto his side and forced himself to stand.</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s that time of year, huh?\u201d He said to only himself.</p><p>Joxter stood up and stretched his weary bones, his joints popped and cracked, then settled. He placed his lovely red hat on top of his unruly hair and stepped out into the morning light, yawning as the sun hit his face.</p><p>He started his fire and set some water to boil, catching sight of his tired reflection. Bags hung under his blue eyes, which seemed duller that morning. Had he really slept that bad that night? He blinked and rubbed his eyes, then splashed water from the river onto his face. He didn\u2019t want the others to see him looking so miserable.</p><p>When his morning routine was done, he began to amble along the path towards Moominhouse, his back slowly straightening and his face brightening, he really didn\u2019t want them to see his miserable like that.</p><p>This always happened, he\u2019d spend the whole year just fine, then suddenly, he\u2019d dream about them and have to remember that life. He hated that life and just thinking back to it made him miserable.</p><p>Joxter had been told once, that he had to tell people his problems, or they wouldn\u2019t get better, but he didn\u2019t like worrying people so he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He stopped at the bridge and looked over to his son\u2019s tent, he could barely see inside, but it was enough to know that Snufkin wasn\u2019t in there.</p><p>\u201cMust\u2019ve gone inside\u2026\u201d he mumbled to himself and made his way up to Moominhouse, taking a deep breath before he barged in, in his usual chaotic manner.</p><p>Nothing seemed to be amiss with anyone, he lifted Snufkin\u2019s hat and messed up his hair before dropping it back on his head, Snufkin swatted at his hands in an attempt to keep him away.</p><p>He flopped down into a chair and looked at the children, who were all eating their breakfast and talking amongst themselves. Shutting his eyes and basking in how calm it was.</p><p>The young Snorkmaiden walked in, her face was twisted up to show that she was rather frustrated, not that Joxter saw it, since his eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Snorkmaiden?\u201d Little My asked before shoving almost an entire pancake into her mouth somehow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Snork\u2026\u201d She sighed and sat down, \u201cHe\u2019s become frustrated with his work again\u2026 He can\u2019t come up with any ideas\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he do for a living?\u201d Joxter asked without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s an engineer, \u201d Snorkmaiden answered, she hadn\u2019t actually noticed the Joxter, \u201che does a lot of inventing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn engineer you say?\u201d He blinked one eye open then sat up to look at her, he seemed very happy to learn of an engineer, \u201cWhat\u2019s he like working on the most?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis flying ship of course, \u201d She beamed, very proud of how hard her brother works, \u201cWhy are you interested, are you an engineer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, no!\u201d Moominpapa interrupted with a laugh, as he walked into the room \u201cI\u2019m not even sure if Joxter can read!\u201d</p><p>Joxter wasn\u2019t one for glaring, especially not at people he liked, like Moominpapa, however today he found himself glaring very hard at his dear friend.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can read!\u201d He hissed, \u201cI have a degree you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain with this degree!\u201d Moominpapa wasn\u2019t being mean, he was joking around with the Joxter, \u201cIf you really have one, how come we\u2019ve never seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left it with Mymble! It\u2019s far too cumbersome to carry it around on my travels!\u201d Joxter was sitting up fully and was in a very alert state.</p><p>\u201cHow convenient.\u201d Moominpapa chuckled, his tone was playful, and he really did mean no harm, but the Joxter did not seem to realize that.</p><p>He bit his lip in a way that would keep him from shouting something very nasty and stood up. He pushed his chair in, in a rough manner (he still wanted to be polite, but he was very angry) and stormed right out of Moominhouse. Moominpapa went to the window to watch him leave, he seemed very confused by this before.</p><p>\u201cThis is hardly the first time that\u2019s been joked about, \u201d he tapped his chin, \u201cand he\u2019s always laughed on with us.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin started at the door his father left through, then looked back to his friends, who all seemed to share the confusion. Joxter didn\u2019t really ever get angry with people, and if he found himself getting really angry he\u2019d excuse himself from the room, and never show how angry he was. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to think that we had been bothering him this whole time with that and he never said anything\u2026\u201d Moominpapa sounded regretful.</p><p>Little My turned to her brother and shrugged, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve seen the degree before, it\u2019s hanging on momma\u2019s wall, in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Snufkin tilted his head, he didn\u2019t think his father was the studious type.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u201d she nodded \u201cit\u2019s from\u2026.\u201d She paused and her face scrunched up as she began to think, \u201csomeplace called States-worth University\u2026 I think\u2026\u201d</p><p>Snufkin looked extremely shocked, and he dropped his fork from his hand. He traveled all around, and he knew a lot of things about all sorts of places, he knew exactly what kind of place States-worth was. He suddenly stood up and began to rush out of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Moomintroll called out to him.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask my papa something!\u201d Snufkin called back, \u201cI\u2019ll return later!\u201d</p><p>He hurried across the bridge and along the river bank until he came to his father\u2019s campsite, he slid to a stop and caught his breath. Listening carefully. He heard a shuffling inside his father\u2019s tent, and he knew Joxter was here.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d He walked to the tent\u2019s entrance, \u201cAre you there?\u201d He just had to be sure.</p><p>There was a long pause before Joxter finally answered with a tired \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Snufkin sat down outside of the tent, and didn\u2019t force his way inside, \u201cWhy did you get mad at Moominpappa?\u201d</p><p>Joxter frowned and rolled onto his back, staring up at the sky, \u201cI just\u2026. It\u2019s only that\u2026 well\u2026 no, I don\u2019t think I can explain it\u2026 It\u2019s stupid anyway.\u201d</p><p>He covered his face with his arm and hoped that Snufkin would be satisfied with that answer.</p><p>Snufkin thought about what he wanted to say next, then asked another question, \u201cDid you really do to States-worth University?\u201d He asked, his tone was low.</p><p>Joxter sat up quickly and struggled to find a response, he wasn\u2019t sure how Snufkin found out about this and he really didn\u2019t know what to say. He panicked a little before squeezing his eyes hit and taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is one of the most prestigious schools, ever, only extremely well-off families can get in there!\u201d Snufkin said to him, he was shocked before he had thought that Little My had only been messing with him, not telling the truth, but there was the truth all laid out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Joxter covered his face with his hands and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow did you go there?\u201d Snufkin pressed, leaning forward a bit.</p><p>Joxter opened the flap of his tent, and Snufkin leaned back in surprise, his father looked exhausted, \u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell you\u2026 It\u2019s your family too I suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>He motioned for Snufkin to come in and Snufkin slowly crawled inside. Sitting across from his sad looking father.</p><p>\u201cMy parents, your grandparents, were an extremely well off family. Extremely well off.\u201d Joxter sighed and leaned his face on his hand, \u201cGrowing up I went to all of the best schools there were, what a coincidence that they were all boarding schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Snufkin nodded and glanced around at his father now, it was hard to imagine he had once been rich.</p><p>\u201cI never saw much of my mother or father, since every time I graduated from one school, I was shipped off to a new one.\u201d He stared blankly at the ground, scratching marks into the dirt with the hand not supporting his head, \u201cAnd when I was on break and back home, my parents just dragged me around to every fancy social gathering they could. So they could put me on a pedestal and show off how talented I was.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin watched him, he didn\u2019t press his father to keep speaking, in fact, he figured Joxter was done there, but when he looked at Joxter\u2019s eyes, he saw there was way more that needed to be said.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t care about me, Snufkin. They just wanted a child that would make their family look good, and when I wasn\u2019t exactly what they wanted they\u2026.\u201d He trailed off, his hands stopped moving, \u201cthey\u2026\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, he really hadn\u2019t told anyone about this, and he found it hard to say, \u201cThey\u2026 Threw me out\u2026 Their own son\u2026\u201d He covered his eyes with his hands and leaned his elbows on his knees. He shook his head.</p><p>A silence filled the tent, neither of them knew what they could say. It felt like there was nothing to be said. Snufkin reached over and placed a hand on his papa\u2019s hand, suddenly removing Joxter that it was his son he was speaking too. When he lifted his head, Snufkin removed his hand and tried to smile at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Joxter shook his head again, his breath was shaky, and he didn\u2019t want any of this to show.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d Snufkin asked perplexed \u201cI\u2019m the one who brought it up. I should apologize to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not apologizing about all of, \u201d he gestured vaguely around himself, \u201cthis! I\u2019m apologizing to you. I should have done it sooner.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin still didn\u2019t really understand, and it showed on his face. When Joxter vaguely gestured to Snufkin, the confusion remained. Joxter sighed and rubber this face again.</p><p>\u201cYour life?\u201d He finally said, and it seemed to click fully for Snufkin on what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize for that, I\u2019m very happy!\u201d Snufkin beamed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou grew up alone. In the woods. With no family.\u201d Joxter reminded him, not that Snufkin really needed reminding, he just didn\u2019t want to bring that up.</p><p>Snufkin frowned, folding his arms, \u201cYes. I did. Did it happen on purpose?\u201d He had suddenly turned to a more cold look, worried that his old fears would come true.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Joxter snapped to look at him, seemingly horrified that Snufkin would suggest that.</p><p>\u201cWell, then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taking you out for a while, for a camping trip.\u201d He began to explain, \u201cYou never liked Mymble\u2019s house, it was always too loud for you, so I tried to get you out and about as often as I could.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, curious as to where he was going with this.</p><p>\u201cWe were in a small boat on a river, I always liked to find new places to camp.\u201d He smiled fondly at the idea of finding somewhere new to be, the smile faded as he remembered the rest of the story, \u201cThe current picked up\u2026 I tried to get us out of there, but I couldn\u2019t. The boat overturned on a rock, I went under water\u2026 And by the time I came up again, I couldn\u2019t find anything. Not even the boat.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin didn\u2019t look so cold anymore, just sad now. He always wanted to know why he didn\u2019t grow up in a nice safe home, and of course, he always knew the story wouldn\u2019t be a good one, yet still, he wished it had been nicer to hear.</p><p>He fiddled with his own hands and stared at the dirt, \u201cDid you look for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, \u201d the Joxter closed his eyes, \u201cthat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t go back to the Mymble. I didn\u2019t want to ever return until I found you. Then one day the Muddler and Hodgkins found me and said they were going to see Moominpapa and his family, and well, you were there when we showed up.\u201d</p><p>Snufkin smiled, \u201cI liked hearing all of Moominpapa\u2019s stories about you, but it was much nicer to put a face to your name, papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, how sweet.\u201d The Joxter said in a joking tone. Then he took a deep breath and laid down, \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t actually told anyone about my past, up until you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Snufkin asked curiously, though he then realized that he shouldn\u2019t pry so much, \u00a0he quickly came to the regretful conclusion that he had already pried too much.</p><p>Joxter shrugged and found it hard to answer, he searched for a bit before coming to a conclusion, \u201cI guess, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everyone knows exactly how I was raised, and that I\u2019m supposed to be fancy and proper, they might get good expectations of me.\u201d His face was serious, \u201cI can\u2019t have people expecting me to be decent! Then I can\u2019t sleep all day!\u201d his serious look broke away into a huge smile, and he began to laugh.</p><p>Snufkin rolled his eyes and laughed a bit too, \u201cOkay, okay, what\u2019s the real reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the real reason!\u201d Joxter sat up and looked at him, still with a huge smile on his face, \u201cIf people don\u2019t expect much from me then I can\u2019t ever disappoint them, and they won\u2019t ever make me leave!\u201d</p><p>Snufkin paused, quickly dissecting that sentence in his head, then looking at the Joxter in surprise. Joxter just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m gonna grab my degree from Mymble\u2019s house, so I can rub it in Moominpapa\u2019s face!\u201d he quickly left the tent and began marching in the direction on Mymble\u2019s house, and Snufkin followed him quickly.</p><p>\u201cPapa wait, \u201d Snufkin grabbed his wrist, and Joxter turned to look at him, \u201cYou know none of us will ever send you away right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah of course-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d Snufkin said in a very sad tone, his wanted Joxter to know it and not forget it, \u201cFamily doesn\u2019t kick family out. A real family will help you and support you. That\u2019s what Moominmama\u2019s taught me.\u201d He quickly wrapped Joxter in a big hug and squeezed him as tight as he could.</p><p>Joxter smiled peacefully and gently hugged Snufkin back, \u201cI know that\u2026\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p>When Joxter gets angry at an old joke of Mooimpapa&rsquo;s, Snufkin learns something odd about his father, making him start to questions his family history.</p><p>A sort of AU that gives Joxter more of a backstory. Nothing is really changed in the future, I just couldn&rsquo;t get this idea of a backstory out of my head. (this is the sad fic I mentioned yesterday)</p><p>&ldquo;Son!&rdquo; An angry women&rsquo;s harsh voice snapped at her child, calling him to her side, &ldquo;What on Earth did you think you were doing?!&rdquo; She hissed at the young man.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I was just talking to the other boy, mother.&rdquo; The child fiddled with the ends of his coat, looking sadly at the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;That child is a peasant! He&rsquo;s beneath us!&rdquo; She scoffed and grabbed his child by the wrist, &ldquo;You just never talk to anyone like that again, understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, mother&hellip;&rdquo; The child winced at how hard his arm was grabbed but did not pull away, not even when his mother began to drag him off. From over his shoulder, the child could see the poor boy who watched them leave and stared apologetically.</p><p>The beggar boy turned back to his own mother, who seemed a lot nicer than the rich boy&rsquo;s mother, and he hugged her arm. The rich boy watched them until he could no longer see them.</p><p>Joxter woke up from the dream, laying in his tent in the early morning, blinking up at the small bits of sunlight that crept inside. He rolled onto his side and forced himself to stand.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s that time of year, huh?&rdquo; He said to only himself.</p><p>Joxter stood up and stretched his weary bones, his joints popped and cracked, then settled. He placed his lovely red hat on top of his unruly hair and stepped out into the morning light, yawning as the sun hit his face.</p><p>He started his fire and set some water to boil, catching sight of his tired reflection. Bags hung under his blue eyes, which seemed duller that morning. Had he really slept that bad that night? He blinked and rubbed his eyes, then splashed water from the river onto his face. He didn&rsquo;t want the others to see him looking so miserable.</p><p>When his morning routine was done, he began to amble along the path towards Moominhouse, his back slowly straightening and his face brightening, he really didn&rsquo;t want them to see his miserable like that.</p><p>This always happened, he&rsquo;d spend the whole year just fine, then suddenly, he&rsquo;d dream about them and have to remember that life. He hated that life and just thinking back to it made him miserable.</p><p>Joxter had been told once, that he had to tell people his problems, or they wouldn&rsquo;t get better, but he didn&rsquo;t like worrying people so he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>He stopped at the bridge and looked over to his son&rsquo;s tent, he could barely see inside, but it was enough to know that Snufkin wasn&rsquo;t in there.</p><p>&ldquo;Must&rsquo;ve gone inside&hellip;&rdquo; he mumbled to himself and made his way up to Moominhouse, taking a deep breath before he barged in, in his usual chaotic manner.</p><p>Nothing seemed to be amiss with anyone, he lifted Snufkin&rsquo;s hat and messed up his hair before dropping it back on his head, Snufkin swatted at his hands in an attempt to keep him away.</p><p>He flopped down into a chair and looked at the children, who were all eating their breakfast and talking amongst themselves. Shutting his eyes and basking in how calm it was.</p><p>The young Snorkmaiden walked in, her face was twisted up to show that she was rather frustrated, not that Joxter saw it, since his eyes were closed.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Snorkmaiden?&rdquo; Little My asked before shoving almost an entire pancake into her mouth somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Snork&hellip;&rdquo; She sighed and sat down, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s become frustrated with his work again&hellip; He can&rsquo;t come up with any ideas&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he do for a living?&rdquo; Joxter asked without opening his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s an engineer, &rdquo; Snorkmaiden answered, she hadn&rsquo;t actually noticed the Joxter, &ldquo;he does a lot of inventing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An engineer you say?&rdquo; He blinked one eye open then sat up to look at her, he seemed very happy to learn of an engineer, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like working on the most?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His flying ship of course, &rdquo; She beamed, very proud of how hard her brother works, &ldquo;Why are you interested, are you an engineer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo; Moominpapa interrupted with a laugh, as he walked into the room &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure if Joxter can read!&rdquo;</p><p>Joxter wasn&rsquo;t one for glaring, especially not at people he liked, like Moominpapa, however today he found himself glaring very hard at his dear friend.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I can read!&rdquo; He hissed, &ldquo;I have a degree you know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Again with this degree!&rdquo; Moominpapa wasn&rsquo;t being mean, he was joking around with the Joxter, &ldquo;If you really have one, how come we&rsquo;ve never seen it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left it with Mymble! It&rsquo;s far too cumbersome to carry it around on my travels!&rdquo; Joxter was sitting up fully and was in a very alert state.</p><p>&ldquo;How convenient.&rdquo; Moominpapa chuckled, his tone was playful, and he really did mean no harm, but the Joxter did not seem to realize that.</p><p>He bit his lip in a way that would keep him from shouting something very nasty and stood up. He pushed his chair in, in a rough manner (he still wanted to be polite, but he was very angry) and stormed right out of Moominhouse. Moominpapa went to the window to watch him leave, he seemed very confused by this before.</p><p>&ldquo;This is hardly the first time that&rsquo;s been joked about, &rdquo; he tapped his chin, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s always laughed on with us.&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin started at the door his father left through, then looked back to his friends, who all seemed to share the confusion. Joxter didn&rsquo;t really ever get angry with people, and if he found himself getting really angry he&rsquo;d excuse himself from the room, and never show how angry he was. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to think that we had been bothering him this whole time with that and he never said anything&hellip;&rdquo; Moominpapa sounded regretful.</p><p>Little My turned to her brother and shrugged, &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve seen the degree before, it&rsquo;s hanging on momma&rsquo;s wall, in her room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Snufkin tilted his head, he didn&rsquo;t think his father was the studious type.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, &rdquo; she nodded &ldquo;it&rsquo;s from&hellip;.&rdquo; She paused and her face scrunched up as she began to think, &ldquo;someplace called States-worth University&hellip; I think&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin looked extremely shocked, and he dropped his fork from his hand. He traveled all around, and he knew a lot of things about all sorts of places, he knew exactly what kind of place States-worth was. He suddenly stood up and began to rush out of the house.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Moomintroll called out to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to ask my papa something!&rdquo; Snufkin called back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll return later!&rdquo;</p><p>He hurried across the bridge and along the river bank until he came to his father&rsquo;s campsite, he slid to a stop and caught his breath. Listening carefully. He heard a shuffling inside his father&rsquo;s tent, and he knew Joxter was here.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa?&rdquo; He walked to the tent&rsquo;s entrance, &ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo; He just had to be sure.</p><p>There was a long pause before Joxter finally answered with a tired &ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin sat down outside of the tent, and didn&rsquo;t force his way inside, &ldquo;Why did you get mad at Moominpappa?&rdquo;</p><p>Joxter frowned and rolled onto his back, staring up at the sky, &ldquo;I just&hellip;. It&rsquo;s only that&hellip; well&hellip; no, I don&rsquo;t think I can explain it&hellip; It&rsquo;s stupid anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>He covered his face with his arm and hoped that Snufkin would be satisfied with that answer.</p><p>Snufkin thought about what he wanted to say next, then asked another question, &ldquo;Did you really do to States-worth University?&rdquo; He asked, his tone was low.</p><p>Joxter sat up quickly and struggled to find a response, he wasn&rsquo;t sure how Snufkin found out about this and he really didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He panicked a little before squeezing his eyes hit and taking a deep breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is one of the most prestigious schools, ever, only extremely well-off families can get in there!&rdquo; Snufkin said to him, he was shocked before he had thought that Little My had only been messing with him, not telling the truth, but there was the truth all laid out in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; Joxter covered his face with his hands and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you go there?&rdquo; Snufkin pressed, leaning forward a bit.</p><p>Joxter opened the flap of his tent, and Snufkin leaned back in surprise, his father looked exhausted, &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip; It&rsquo;s your family too I suppose&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He motioned for Snufkin to come in and Snufkin slowly crawled inside. Sitting across from his sad looking father.</p><p>&ldquo;My parents, your grandparents, were an extremely well off family. Extremely well off.&rdquo; Joxter sighed and leaned his face on his hand, &ldquo;Growing up I went to all of the best schools there were, what a coincidence that they were all boarding schools.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo; Snufkin nodded and glanced around at his father now, it was hard to imagine he had once been rich.</p><p>&ldquo;I never saw much of my mother or father, since every time I graduated from one school, I was shipped off to a new one.&rdquo; He stared blankly at the ground, scratching marks into the dirt with the hand not supporting his head, &ldquo;And when I was on break and back home, my parents just dragged me around to every fancy social gathering they could. So they could put me on a pedestal and show off how talented I was.&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin watched him, he didn&rsquo;t press his father to keep speaking, in fact, he figured Joxter was done there, but when he looked at Joxter&rsquo;s eyes, he saw there was way more that needed to be said.</p><p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t care about me, Snufkin. They just wanted a child that would make their family look good, and when I wasn&rsquo;t exactly what they wanted they&hellip;.&rdquo; He trailed off, his hands stopped moving, &ldquo;they&hellip;&rdquo; He squeezed his eyes shut, he really hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about this, and he found it hard to say, &ldquo;They&hellip; Threw me out&hellip; Their own son&hellip;&rdquo; He covered his eyes with his hands and leaned his elbows on his knees. He shook his head.</p><p>A silence filled the tent, neither of them knew what they could say. It felt like there was nothing to be said. Snufkin reached over and placed a hand on his papa&rsquo;s hand, suddenly removing Joxter that it was his son he was speaking too. When he lifted his head, Snufkin removed his hand and tried to smile at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; Joxter shook his head again, his breath was shaky, and he didn&rsquo;t want any of this to show.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you apologizing?&rdquo; Snufkin asked perplexed &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who brought it up. I should apologize to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not apologizing about all of, &rdquo; he gestured vaguely around himself, &ldquo;this! I&rsquo;m apologizing to you. I should have done it sooner.&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin still didn&rsquo;t really understand, and it showed on his face. When Joxter vaguely gestured to Snufkin, the confusion remained. Joxter sighed and rubber this face again.</p><p>&ldquo;Your life?&rdquo; He finally said, and it seemed to click fully for Snufkin on what he was saying.</p><p>&ldquo;No need to apologize for that, I&rsquo;m very happy!&rdquo; Snufkin beamed at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You grew up alone. In the woods. With no family.&rdquo; Joxter reminded him, not that Snufkin really needed reminding, he just didn&rsquo;t want to bring that up.</p><p>Snufkin frowned, folding his arms, &ldquo;Yes. I did. Did it happen on purpose?&rdquo; He had suddenly turned to a more cold look, worried that his old fears would come true.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Joxter snapped to look at him, seemingly horrified that Snufkin would suggest that.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then what happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was taking you out for a while, for a camping trip.&rdquo; He began to explain, &ldquo;You never liked Mymble&rsquo;s house, it was always too loud for you, so I tried to get you out and about as often as I could.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, curious as to where he was going with this.</p><p>&ldquo;We were in a small boat on a river, I always liked to find new places to camp.&rdquo; He smiled fondly at the idea of finding somewhere new to be, the smile faded as he remembered the rest of the story, &ldquo;The current picked up&hellip; I tried to get us out of there, but I couldn&rsquo;t. The boat overturned on a rock, I went under water&hellip; And by the time I came up again, I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. Not even the boat.&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin didn&rsquo;t look so cold anymore, just sad now. He always wanted to know why he didn&rsquo;t grow up in a nice safe home, and of course, he always knew the story wouldn&rsquo;t be a good one, yet still, he wished it had been nicer to hear.</p><p>He fiddled with his own hands and stared at the dirt, &ldquo;Did you look for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, &rdquo; the Joxter closed his eyes, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t go back to the Mymble. I didn&rsquo;t want to ever return until I found you. Then one day the Muddler and Hodgkins found me and said they were going to see Moominpapa and his family, and well, you were there when we showed up.&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin smiled, &ldquo;I liked hearing all of Moominpapa&rsquo;s stories about you, but it was much nicer to put a face to your name, papa.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aw, how sweet.&rdquo; The Joxter said in a joking tone.

Then I can&rsquo;t sleep all day!&rdquo; his serious look broke away into a huge smile, and he began to laugh.</p><p>Snufkin rolled his eyes and laughed a bit too, &ldquo;Okay, okay, what&rsquo;s the real reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the real reason!&rdquo; Joxter sat up and looked at him, still with a huge smile on his face, &ldquo;If people don&rsquo;t expect much from me then I can&rsquo;t ever disappoint them, and they won&rsquo;t ever make me leave!&rdquo;</p><p>Snufkin paused, quickly dissecting that sentence in his head, then looking at the Joxter in surprise. Joxter just shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;m gonna grab my degree from Mymble&rsquo;s house, so I can rub it in Moominpapa&rsquo;s face!&rdquo; he quickly left the tent and began marching in the direction on Mymble&rsquo;s house, and Snufkin followed him quickly.</p><p>&ldquo;Papa wait, &rdquo; Snufkin grabbed his wrist, and Joxter turned to look at him, &ldquo;You know none of us will ever send you away right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah of course-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Snufkin said in a very sad tone, his wanted Joxter to know it and not forget it, &ldquo;Family doesn&rsquo;t kick family out.
