In their last scene together a bump is visible on her belly indicating that she is pregnant with their first child. Rheagal never dies. </p><p>Jon:  Kills the Night King. Accepts his identity as both a Targaryen and a Stark and rules in KL with his wife. Ghost dislikes the warm weather but after a good shave and a personal swimming pool he\u2019s fine. </p><p>Sansa: QITN! QITN! QITN! </p><p>Arya: Sails west but eventually returns to Westeros. Settles down at Storm\u2019s End and marries Gendry. Visits her remaining family regularly.

Perhaps it would be nice if he married Meera and reclaimed his humanity somehow. Or stayed in WF with Sansa. </p><p>Cersei: Strangled by Jaime after she wants to burn down KL with wildfire. </p><p>Jaime: Sleeps with Brienne after the Battle of Winterfell but leaves for KL after he hears about his sister\u2019s plans. He promises Brienne to come back to her afterwards and admits that he loves her. She accepts but eventually changes her mind and decides to go after him. After Cersei is killed he gets stabbed by Euron but manages to stay alive long enough for Brienne to find him. He dies in her arms.</p><p>Tyrion: The writers have done him dirty since season 4. They completely messed up his character by putting him in the background. In later seasons the only things he does is crack stupid jokes and fuck up Dany\u2019s plans. And since he has proven to be such a shitty hand (remember the <i>seven</i> years, anyone??) It would\u2019ve left a bitter taste in my mouth seeing him continue to serve the queen. I guess it would\u2019ve been kind of nice seeing him make his own wine in some distant corner of the world but I would\u2019ve been just as fine with him dying too. </p><p>Sam: Grand Maester and happily married to Gilly.</p><p>Missandei &amp; Greyworm: Alive and still part of Dany\u2019s squad. Going on occasional vacations to Naarth. </p><p>Jorah: Serves as Dany\u2019s new hand.</p><p>Theon: Sansa\u2019s Hand and not so secret lover. She wants to marry him but he doesn\u2019t want to be king. Perhaps he will agree to it one day. Hero of Winterfell. Forgiven by everyone. Forms a close friendship with Pod. If anyone deserved a happy ending it was Theon. (And Sansa) </p><p>Brienne: After Jaime, she returns to the north to serve as Sansa\u2019s Queen\u2019s Guard. Perhaps she maybe possibly probably starts to like Tormund after some time has gone by. Just a bit.</p><p>Podrick: Becomes ser Podrick Payne. Stays with Brienne and Sansa.

And since he has proven to be such a shitty hand (remember the <i>seven</i> years, anyone??) It would&rsquo;ve left a bitter taste in my mouth seeing him continue to serve the queen. I guess it would&rsquo;ve been kind of nice seeing him make his own wine in some distant corner of the world but I would&rsquo;ve been just as fine with him dying too. </p><p>Sam: Grand Maester and happily married to Gilly.</p><p>Missandei &amp; Greyworm: Alive and still part of Dany&rsquo;s squad. Going on occasional vacations to Naarth. </p><p>Jorah: Serves as Dany&rsquo;s new hand.</p><p>Theon: Sansa&rsquo;s Hand and not so secret lover. She wants to marry him but he doesn&rsquo;t want to be king. Perhaps he will agree to it one day. Hero of Winterfell. Forgiven by everyone. Forms a close friendship with Pod. If anyone deserved a happy ending it was Theon. (And Sansa) </p><p>Brienne: After Jaime, she returns to the north to serve as Sansa&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Guard. Perhaps she maybe possibly probably starts to like Tormund after some time has gone by. Just a bit.</p><p>Podrick: Becomes ser Podrick Payne. Stays with Brienne and Sansa. Hangs out with Theon.</p><p>Davos: Master of Ships. Jon&rsquo;s most trusted adviser.</p><p>Bronn: Gets his damn castle I suppose. I couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p><p>Qyburn: Killed by the Mountain. I loved Qyburn&rsquo;s death. His experiment was too bold in the end indeed. </p><p>Yara: Queen of the Iron Islands. Visits Theon regularly in Winterfell. Mainly to tease him about Sansa. </p><p>Sandor: Dies fighting and killing the Mountain.</p><p>Euron: killed by Jaime or Yara/Theon.</p><p>Melisandre: Dies during the battle of Winterfell.</p>",

Ramsay always seemed to be miles away - except for Biology lessons. Ramsay was fascinated by human\u2019s body, eager to know more which made teacher more than happy and she actually saw some potential in him.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>\n\n<b><i>Margaery</i></b><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gotladies:KkUZgJ_0RizkTo54-6rpEQ:ZMKAKh2hv_OrS\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/44bfc4428331cb192d342b491a8d7acf/tumblr_pqug5oc5gA1vrcr7no1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>\n\nAs pretty as Margaery is, she was clever and also a quick learner. Maybe she wasn\u2019t the best at Math but when it came to Biology and flowers, there was no better student. It didn\u2019t matter what teacher asked about, Margaery never disappointed, raised her hand and answered correctly. And that was how she managed to amaze not only teacher, but classmates as well.</p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Theon</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"331\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"realakai:1GufEX9aKT1G39FUe3L84A:ZIYZIe2POlKDf\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e15764f7368c26124930988ae1e3e0df/tumblr_ovdl95qWkx1w8k76lo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"331\"/></figure><p>\n\nGrades? As if he cared about them. This certain word meant nothing to him. To pass or fail the test - why would that matter? According to Theon, what actually mattered was that pretty girl sitting in front of him in the classroom. She had a picture perfect shaped body, which was driving Theon crazy. So naturally, this girl in his sight was distracting him from everything else happening in the class. Not to mention the useless piece of paper to test his knowledge from last week\u2019s lesson lying on the table, empty, with no answers.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Gendry</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"qkcneufhgskgbfiznfglzjfzofns:5CzVBuVB89II8BNfN3M8UQ:ZoJWXv2P1R0hD\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e9c4fc8f400df14b9bf95d1caf0852a/tumblr_ouumynfQ6N1rtf3g6o2_r4_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"231\"/></figure><p>\n\nGendry was very energetic, so sitting and listening practically for the whole day didn\u2019t exactly suit his taste. What a relief he felt whenever he had PE. He could relax and clear his mind while shaping his body and improving the stamina.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Joffrey</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofthronesdaily:4UWOynN6ov3kMR13mdk3ZA:ZbYfhs2MxCNF5\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86eb54323a34ca34c9a5a6123aa4a200/tumblr_ormhgvwYk11s95j2so2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"236\"/></figure><p>\n\nJoffrey, fully aware of his family\u2019s influence, refused to accept and respect any teachers. For his entertainment, he sabotaged the lessons, bullied his classmates and yelled at teachers. \u201cWhat is this homework even good for?!\u201d was his favorite line. Obviously such behaviour was unbearable and it crossed the line of teachers\u2019 patience. Joffrey eventually ended up with his mom home-schooling him.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b><i>Yara</i></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"236\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"meera-reed:sCrgDWP5BS_gOngbEksd7w:ZV6bFr2hZPZJm\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0bdaf42fc859da1a6f0778a6c200c53a/tumblr_pq091lzTRW1saw731o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"236\"/></figure><p>What kind of lesson Yara couldn\u2019t wait to have?
