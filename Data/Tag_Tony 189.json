Fall days in New York were always a crapshoot, and today Pepper had rolled well.  The skies were fairly clear with just a few puffy clouds overhead, and the air was crisp and clean, or at least as clean as New York City air could get.  Even the water in the Jacqueline Onassis Reservoir looked cleaner than usual.</p><p>\u201cSo, you gonna tell me what your weird dreams were about last night?\u201d Pepper asked as they finally came to a stop, still huffing and puffing.  \u201cOr are you gonna make me guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d gasped Tony, bent over with his hands braced on his knees.  \u201cWhat&rsquo;re you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Peter you had a bunch of weird dreams last night,\u201d Pepper said.  \u201cWhat were they?  And you should keep walking or your legs will cramp up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, this was all your idea, so if my legs cramp up you\u2019ll be the one carrying me back to the car,\u201d Tony shot back, even as he reluctantly stood back up.  Pepper let out a heavy sigh as she threaded her hand through his arm.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Tony,\u201d she said gently.  \u201cDon&rsquo;t try and keep secrets from me, you know that\u2019s what I hate the most.\u201d</p><p>Tony pursed his lips, his brow furrowing as they started to walk.  \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m getting old?\u201d</p><p>Pepper jerked her head back, her eyes narrowing.  \u201cHuh?  What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what it sounds like, Pep,\u201d Tony said.  \u201cDo you think I\u2019m getting old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 well\u2026\u201d Pepper stammered.  \u201cWe\u2019re all getting older, Tony, you know that.  I\u2019m definitely not as young as I was when I first started working for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s not what I meant,\u201d grumbled Tony.  He shook his head, trying to put his jumbled thoughts into words.  \u201cWhen I was younger, I never used to understand how people could say that having kids helped you stay young.  I mean, it would seem like it would be just the opposite, ya know?  It would seem like nothing would age you faster than having a kid.  But then once Pete came along, I kinda understood what that meant, Pep.  Having a child, and seeing the world through their innocent eyes, it really does help you stay young.  Or at least until they start the teenage years.  After that, all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper said, gently tugging on his arm, pulling him to a stop under a large oak tree.  \u201cWhat\u2019re you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought if we stopped walking my legs would cramp up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 forget about your non-existent leg cramps for a second,\u201d retorted Pepper.  \u201cAnd tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Tony inhaled a shaky breath as he looked into Pepper\u2019s beautiful blue eyes.  He felt more nervous now than he was when he proposed to her.  \u201cLast night, I dreamt that we had a kid.  It was so real, Pep.  We even named him after your eccentric uncle\u2026what was his name?\u201d  He snapped his fingers, trying to remember the damn name.  \u201cMorgan, that was his name!  We named him Morgan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper said slowly.  \u201cYou already have a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Tony corrected.  \u201cWe have a kid.  So why can\u2019t we have another?  It was so real, honey.  Like one of those dreams when you think you have to pee, and then you wake up really having to pee?  It was like that.\u201d</p><p>Pepper bit her lip, apparently trying to hide her smile.  \u201cAnd so you woke up from this dream\u2026 and thought we were\u2026 what?  Expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yeah,\u201d admitted Tony.  The layer of sweat coating his body was starting to dry, causing him to shiver.  \u201cWould that be so horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn&rsquo;t say that,\u201d Pepper said.  \u201cBut it\u2019s not something we should just decide on a whim either, Tony.  Having a child is a huge undertaking, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn&rsquo;t like that when I got Peter,\u201d Tony protested.  \u201cI just did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh a whim, Tony!\u201d exclaimed Pepper.  \u201cYou just took him in on a whim, with barely a second thought!  And while things have definitely worked out okay, I mean, Peter\u2019s the sweetest kid ever, so I\u2019m not sure how they couldn't\u2019ve worked out okay, but having a baby?  That&rsquo;s not really something that should be decided just on a whim.  We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was so real, Pep!  And why couldn&rsquo;t we have another one?  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve managed to screw Peter up all that bad, so why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this, Tony,\u201d Pepper said firmly.  She stepped back, untying the jacket Tony had tied around his shoulders and tapping her finger against the nanoparticle storage unit attached to his chest.  \u201cBecause if you really wanted to have another kid, I still don&rsquo;t think you would&rsquo;ve done <i>that</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just a storage unit for nanoparticles, Pep,\u201d Tony said, bringing his palm up to cover the device.  \u201cThis is nothing, and doesn&rsquo;t have any bearing on whether we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, you know that&rsquo;s not true!  You told me yourself that you needed it because you were left defenseless, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means I\u2019m just trying to protect us!\u201d Tony cried.  \u201cAll of us.  You and Peter, and any future us-es that come along.  You can&rsquo;t fault a man for wanting to protect his family, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can when it gets to the point of being an obsession, Tony,\u201d Pepper said.</p><p>\u201cThis is detachable, honey,\u201d Tony insisted.  \u201cIt\u2019s not technically a part of me, not like the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, except that\u2019s not really helping your case when you still sleep with it on,\u201d retorted Pepper.  \u201cIt may as well be implanted since you hardly ever take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you never know when there might be a monster in the closet,\u201d muttered Tony.  \u201cI\u2019m just trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only shirts in your closet, Tony,\u201d Pepper said.  \u201cNot monsters.  The monsters are only in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been monsters in the Tower before,\u201d Tony stated.  \u201cThose Extremis soldiers that broke in and took Peter that one time, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one time, Tony,\u201d said Pepper, placing her fingers over his lips to silence him.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s been years now and nothing since then.  You\u2019ve made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn&rsquo;t mean that something couldn&rsquo;t happen,\u201d said Tony.  He grabbed her hand, kissing her fingers.  \u201cC\u2019mon, I don&rsquo;t wanna argue about this, Pep.  I made dinner reservations for tonight, Steve said he could keep an eye on Peter, so I thought we could go over the rest of the wedding plans, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Tony was cut off by the buzzing of his phone in his pocket, his shoulders sagging at the interruption.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, FRIDAY?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel Rhodes is on the line from the Compound, boss,\u201d answered FRIDAY.  \u201cHe says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, go ahead,\u201d said Tony, his heart already starting to thud.  He shot Pepper a concerned glance, earning a shrug in return.</p><p>\u201cTony!\u201d Rhodes exclaimed, his drawn face filling the screen.  \u201cVision\u2019s stone is acting up again, and this time he says it\u2019s even worse than before.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><p><i><b>The full chapter will post on Monday, December 24th :)</b></i></p>",

I\u2019m definitely not as young as I was when I first started working for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d grumbled Tony.  He shook his head, trying to put his jumbled thoughts into words.  \u201cWhen I was younger, I never used to understand how people could say that having kids helped you stay young.  I mean, it would seem like it would be just the opposite, ya know?  It would seem like nothing would age you faster than having a kid.  But then once Pete came along, I kinda understood what that meant, Pep.  Having a child, and seeing the world through their innocent eyes, it really does help you stay young.  Or at least until they start the teenage years.  After that, all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper said, gently tugging on his arm, pulling him to a stop under a large oak tree.  \u201cWhat\u2019re you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought if we stopped walking my legs would cramp up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2026 forget about your non-existent leg cramps for a second,\u201d retorted Pepper.  \u201cAnd tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Tony inhaled a shaky breath as he looked into Pepper\u2019s beautiful blue eyes.  He felt more nervous now than he was when he proposed to her.  \u201cLast night, I dreamt that we had a kid.  It was so real, Pep.  We even named him after your eccentric uncle\u2026what was his name?\u201d  He snapped his fingers, trying to remember the damn name.  \u201cMorgan, that was his name!  We named him Morgan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper said slowly.  \u201cYou already have a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Tony corrected.  \u201cWe have a kid.  So why can\u2019t we have another?  It was so real, honey.  Like one of those dreams when you think you have to pee, and then you wake up really having to pee?  It was like that.\u201d</p><p>Pepper bit her lip, apparently trying to hide her smile.  \u201cAnd so you woke up from this dream\u2026 and thought we were\u2026 what?  Expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 yeah,\u201d admitted Tony.  The layer of sweat coating his body was starting to dry, causing him to shiver.  \u201cWould that be so horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Pepper said.  \u201cBut it\u2019s not something we should just decide on a whim either, Tony.  Having a child is a huge undertaking, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that when I got Peter,\u201d Tony protested.  \u201cI just did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh a whim, Tony!\u201d exclaimed Pepper.  \u201cYou just took him in on a whim, with barely a second thought!  And while things have definitely worked out okay, I mean, Peter\u2019s the sweetest kid ever, so I\u2019m not sure how they couldn't\u2019ve worked out okay, but having a baby?  That\u2019s not really something that should be decided just on a whim.  We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was so real, Pep!  And why couldn\u2019t we have another one?  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve managed to screw Peter up all that bad, so why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this, Tony,\u201d Pepper said firmly.  She stepped back, untying the jacket Tony had tied around his shoulders and tapping her finger against the nanoparticle storage unit attached to his chest.  \u201cBecause if you really wanted to have another kid, I still don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve done <i>that</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just a storage unit for nanoparticles, Pep,\u201d Tony said, bringing his palm up to cover the device.  \u201cThis is nothing, and doesn\u2019t have any bearing on whether we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, you know that\u2019s not true!  You told me yourself that you needed it because you were left defenseless, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means I\u2019m just trying to protect us!\u201d Tony cried.  \u201cAll of us.  You and Peter, and any future us-es that come along.  You can\u2019t fault a man for wanting to protect his family, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can when it gets to the point of being an obsession, Tony,\u201d Pepper said.</p><p>\u201cThis is detachable, honey,\u201d Tony insisted.  \u201cIt\u2019s not technically a part of me, not like the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, except that\u2019s not really helping your case when you still sleep with it on,\u201d retorted Pepper.  \u201cIt may as well be implanted since you hardly ever take it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you never know when there might be a monster in the closet,\u201d muttered Tony.  \u201cI\u2019m just trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only shirts in your closet, Tony,\u201d Pepper said.  \u201cNot monsters.  The monsters are only in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been monsters in the Tower before,\u201d Tony stated.  \u201cThose Extremis soldiers that broke in and took Peter that one time, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one time, Tony,\u201d said Pepper, placing her fingers over his lips to silence him.  \u201cAnd it\u2019s been years now and nothing since then.  You\u2019ve made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that something couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Tony.  He grabbed her hand, kissing her fingers.  \u201cC\u2019mon, I don\u2019t wanna argue about this, Pep.

And while things have definitely worked out okay, I mean, Peter&rsquo;s the sweetest kid ever, so I&rsquo;m not sure how they couldn't&rsquo;ve worked out okay, but having a baby?  That&rsquo;s not really something that should be decided just on a whim.  We need to talk about this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it was so real, Pep!  And why couldn&rsquo;t we have another one?  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve managed to screw Peter up all that bad, so why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to talk about this, Tony,&rdquo; Pepper said firmly.  She stepped back, untying the jacket Tony had tied around his shoulders and tapping her finger against the nanoparticle storage unit attached to his chest.  &ldquo;Because if you really wanted to have another kid, I still don&rsquo;t think you would&rsquo;ve done <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is just a storage unit for nanoparticles, Pep,&rdquo; Tony said, bringing his palm up to cover the device.  &ldquo;This is nothing, and doesn&rsquo;t have any bearing on whether we&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, you know that&rsquo;s not true!  You told me yourself that you needed it because you were left defenseless, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which means I&rsquo;m just trying to protect us!&rdquo; Tony cried.  &ldquo;All of us.  You and Peter, and any future us-es that come along.  You can&rsquo;t fault a man for wanting to protect his family, can you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can when it gets to the point of being an obsession, Tony,&rdquo; Pepper said.</p><p>&ldquo;This is detachable, honey,&rdquo; Tony insisted.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not technically a part of me, not like the last one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, except that&rsquo;s not really helping your case when you still sleep with it on,&rdquo; retorted Pepper.  &ldquo;It may as well be implanted since you hardly ever take it off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you never know when there might be a monster in the closet,&rdquo; muttered Tony.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are only shirts in your closet, Tony,&rdquo; Pepper said.  &ldquo;Not monsters.  The monsters are only in your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been monsters in the Tower before,&rdquo; Tony stated.  &ldquo;Those Extremis soldiers that broke in and took Peter that one time, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was one time, Tony,&rdquo; said Pepper, placing her fingers over his lips to silence him.  &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s been years now and nothing since then.  You&rsquo;ve made sure of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean that something couldn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; said Tony.  He grabbed her hand, kissing her fingers.  &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I don&rsquo;t wanna argue about this, Pep.  I made dinner reservations for tonight, Steve said he could keep an eye on Peter, so I thought we could go over the rest of the wedding plans, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>But Tony was cut off by the buzzing of his phone in his pocket, his shoulders sagging at the interruption.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, FRIDAY?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Colonel Rhodes is on the line from the Compound, boss,&rdquo; answered FRIDAY.  &ldquo;He says it&rsquo;s urgent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, go ahead,&rdquo; said Tony, his heart already starting to thud.  He shot Pepper a concerned glance, earning a shrug in return.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony!&rdquo; Rhodes exclaimed, his drawn face filling the screen.  &ldquo;Vision&rsquo;s stone is acting up again, and this time he says it&rsquo;s even worse than before.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p><i><b>The full chapter will post on Monday, December 24th :)</b></i></p></p>",

After some nuzzling that Tony had managed to get used to and focus back on the meeting he\u2019d felt those dextrous little hands start pulling at the elastic and before he could try and stop it there was a warm, wet mouth on the head of his cock and he had to knock over his pen holder to cover the moan that managed to get past his lips.

He nodded politely as a goodbye and then the second the door closed all the way he pushed his chair back and hauled Peter into his lap.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You will honestly be the death of me.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>They kissed messily as Peter fumbled to get his own trousers open to the point that he could arch forwards and rub himself up against Tony, making them both groan loudly.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I liked that&hellip; Knowing if I&rsquo;d just gone a little quicker it would have given us away&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo; Peter gasped, his forehead pressed against Tony&rsquo;s neck as he rocked lazily against his boss, moaning quietly.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Such a little slut aren&rsquo;t you&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo; Tony tries to be firm but it just comes out breathy.</p><p>Soon their gasping into each others mouths, rutting and rolling their hips until its finally more than Tony can cope with so he wraps his hand around both of them and starts jerking his hand, pulling a whiny moan from Peter. It takes no time at all before Peter is giving his telltale whimpers.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Come for me baby boy, you were so good.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>That pushes Peter over the edge and he spills between them, getting it all over his own trousers and Tonys shirt, but neither of them cares, especially as they both watch as Tony follows him over the edge. Peter slumps against him, trousers lose on his hips, chest heaving. Suddenly the door opens and they both scramble to get covered up. The clip of heels comes to an instant stop.</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Are you to kidding me, again. There is a lock on this door you know.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Pepper slams the door behind her as she leaves and the two men burst into fits of happy giggles.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>I<b>&rsquo;m not overly happy with the end but I hope you enjoy.</b></p>",

It was two days away and he had to make sure everything was perfect, especially for Peter.<b><br/></b></p><p>Ugly sweater theme? Check. He was already grinning at what Natasha would make Bucky wear. </p><p><i>Poke. Something taped his shoulder but he ignored it.</i></p><p>Endless amount of food and desserts? Check. He not only had spider-boy\u2019s metabolism to worry about but also two super soldiers and one god. </p><p><i>Poke. Tony just shrugged it off eyes still glued to his Stark pad. </i></p><p>Is the guest list correct? Check. Much smaller than years before but he wasn\u2019t about to subject his kid to a mass of strangers. Besides, half of the people he usually invited were only there for the bragging rights. </p><p>A finger jabbed his face repeatedly. Tony jolted, eyes landing certain spiderling hanging upside down. He sighed a smirk tugging at his lips as Peter shrugged hands hiding under sweater paws.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too kiddo,\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou know there are better ways of getting my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said hello when I walked in but you were lost in your own little world to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo jabbing your finger at my face was a better option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I could have dumped water on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would have taken you off the Christmas Eve Eve party guest list.\u201d</p><p>His kid scoffed skill sticking to the ceiling. \u201cYou love me too much to do that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled poking the Spider-Boy back. \u201cYou got me there buddy and besides the team would murder me if I stopped them from meeting your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s face grew red as he dropped to the floor. Tony laughed as the poor kid groaned into his hands remembering what the team told him last night. </p><p>\u201cOh God, they\u2019re going to embarrass me aren\u2019t they.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to team kiddo. You know they mean well.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Clint\u2019s even going out of his way to buy you two some protection if the need-\u201c</p><p><i>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew to the shade of his suit, mouth open in shock. His eyes grew wide as Tony howled in laughter. He shook his head mumbling to himself. </p><p>\u201cI already know Natasha did a background check on MJ but Clint? Oh man, I\u2019m never going to live this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the team last night, they want to get to know her.\u201d</p><p>His kid shook his head groaning as his face remained the same shade of red. To Tony this was all endearing, it took the poor big mouths to even admit he like her let alone to tell it to her face. It was his first real relationship and everyone wanted to make sure he was ok. MJ checked out, but they still wanted to meet her in person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid, they know not to embarrass you that much. They just like to tease you. Your \u00a0face practically lights up when you talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s perfect, Tony,\u201d Peter whispered into his hands.</p><p>\u201cLoverboy is falling hard I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll change the subject. I\u2019m sure you wanted to tell me something before I mention your girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d He said sheepishly fiddling with his hands still hiding underneath his sweater. \u201cJust um don\u2019t freak out.\u201d </p><p>Now more alert, Tony\u2019s smile fell off his face. Worry overtook him as he stared over Peter for any noticeable injuries. He seemed fine but knowing his kid, he could hide injuries pretty well.</p><p>\u201cSo, on my here, there was this robbery and my suit got messed up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed in relief. \u201cPete, I can fix your suit, that\u2019s no big deal-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really feel my hands.\u201d</p><p>Tony leaped up from his chair, hands pushing back the sleeve to his kid\u2019s sweater. He gasped at the state of Peter\u2019s hands, red and blistering almost looking frozen. </p><p>\u201cThe dude had some freeze ray and I\u2019m pretty sure I have frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Peter, why didn\u2019t you tell me this first! </p><p>\u201cYou seemed in a good mood and I didn\u2019t want to ruin that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have frostbite on your hands! Trust me this takes priority.\u201d </p><p>Peter looked down at the floor. Tony sighed hands gently taking his kid\u2019s. \u201cCome on Pete lets get you fixed up. I\u2019ll even let you pick any movie you want.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cHarry Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll suffer through that.\u201d</p><p>_______</p><p>After a trip to the Med-bay to get a good look at Peter\u2019s hands, Tony was relieved that the frostbite was a mild case. All they had to do is sick his hands in warm water and that should do the trick. And with Peter\u2019s healing, the process would be much quicker. </p><p>Now, they were seated in the living room along with a few other teammates watching Harry Potter. Peter\u2019s hands sat in some warm water as Tony made sure he didn\u2019t take his hands out. Steve was making sure the freeze ray guy was handled and lock away. Serves him right for freezing his kid\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cI always loved Christmas at Hogwarts,\u201d Peter said as a few others agreed. </p><p>\u201cYou can literally see the strings that floating candles are attached to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, stop ruining the illusion!\u201d Peter stuck his tongue out as his phone buzzed. </p><p>Just as he was about to reach it, Tony was quick to keep his hands in the bowl. They were still pretty frozen, and he wasn\u2019t about to risk anything. </p><p>\u201cOh look your girlfriend asking if you\u2019re alright after the robbery,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cAw young love at it\u2019s finest,\u201d Clint sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet her kid. I have a lot of stories to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me now,\u201d Peter mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cHate to break it to you kid but you\u2019re staying with us for a long time.</p><p>\u201cOh joy, what fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to choose to ignore the sarcasm there.\u201d</p><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a

It was two days away and he had to make sure everything was perfect, especially for Peter.<b><br></b></p><p>Ugly sweater theme? Check. He was already grinning at what Natasha would make Bucky wear. </p><p><i>Poke. Something taped his shoulder but he ignored it.</i></p><p>Endless amount of food and desserts? Check. He not only had spider-boy\u2019s metabolism to worry about but also two super soldiers and one god. </p><p><i>Poke. Tony just shrugged it off eyes still glued to his Stark pad. </i></p><p>Is the guest list correct? Check. Much smaller than years before but he wasn\u2019t about to subject his kid to a mass of strangers. Besides, half of the people he usually invited were only there for the bragging rights. </p><p>A finger jabbed his face repeatedly. Tony jolted, eyes landing certain spiderling hanging upside down. He sighed a smirk tugging at his lips as Peter shrugged hands hiding under sweater paws.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too kiddo,\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou know there are better ways of getting my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said hello when I walked in but you were lost in your own little world to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo jabbing your finger at my face was a better option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I could have dumped water on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would have taken you off the Christmas Eve Eve party guest list.\u201d</p><p>His kid scoffed skill sticking to the ceiling. \u201cYou love me too much to do that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled poking the Spider-Boy back. \u201cYou got me there buddy and besides the team would murder me if I stopped them from meeting your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew red as he dropped to the floor. Tony laughed as the poor kid groaned into his hands remembering what the team told him last night. </p><p>\u201cOh God, they\u2019re going to embarrass me aren\u2019t they.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to team kiddo. You know they mean well.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Clint\u2019s even going out of his way to buy you two some protection if the need-\u201c</p><p><i>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew to the shade of his suit, mouth open in shock. His eyes grew wide as Tony howled in laughter. He shook his head mumbling to himself. </p><p>\u201cI already know Natasha did a background check on MJ but Clint? Oh man, I\u2019m never going to live this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the team last night, they want to get to know her.\u201d</p><p>His kid shook his head groaning as his face remained the same shade of red. To Tony this was all endearing, it took the poor big mouths to even admit he like her let alone to tell it to her face. It was his first real relationship and everyone wanted to make sure he was ok. MJ checked out, but they still wanted to meet her in person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid, they know not to embarrass you that much. They just like to tease you. Your \u00a0face practically lights up when you talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s perfect, Tony,\u201d Peter whispered into his hands.</p><p>\u201cLoverboy is falling hard I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll change the subject. I\u2019m sure you wanted to tell me something before I mention your girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d He said sheepishly fiddling with his hands still hiding underneath his sweater. \u201cJust um don\u2019t freak out.\u201d </p><p>Now more alert, Tony\u2019s smile fell off his face. Worry overtook him as he stared over Peter for any noticeable injuries. He seemed fine but knowing his kid, he could hide injuries pretty well.</p><p>\u201cSo, on my here, there was this robbery and my suit got messed up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed in relief. \u201cPete, I can fix your suit, that\u2019s no big deal-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really feel my hands.\u201d</p><p>Tony leaped up from his chair, hands pushing back the sleeve to his kid\u2019s sweater. He gasped at the state of Peter\u2019s hands, red and blistering almost looking frozen. </p><p>\u201cThe dude had some freeze ray and I\u2019m pretty sure I have frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Peter, why didn\u2019t you tell me this first! </p><p>\u201cYou seemed in a good mood and I didn\u2019t want to ruin that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have frostbite on your hands! Trust me this takes priority.\u201d </p><p>Peter looked down at the floor. Tony sighed hands gently taking his kid\u2019s. \u201cCome on Pete lets get you fixed up. I\u2019ll even let you pick any movie you want.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cHarry Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll suffer through that.\u201d</p><p>_______</p><p>After a trip to the Med-bay to get a good look at Peter\u2019s hands, Tony was relieved that the frostbite was a mild case. All they had to do is sick his hands in warm water and that should do the trick. And with Peter\u2019s healing, the process would be much quicker. </p><p>Now, they were seated in the living room along with a few other teammates watching Harry Potter. Peter\u2019s hands sat in some warm water as Tony made sure he didn\u2019t take his hands out. Steve was making sure the freeze ray guy was handled and lock away. Serves him right for freezing his kid\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cI always loved Christmas at Hogwarts,\u201d Peter said as a few others agreed. </p><p>\u201cYou can literally see the strings that floating candles are attached to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, stop ruining the illusion!\u201d Peter stuck his tongue out as his phone buzzed. </p><p>Just as he was about to reach it, Tony was quick to keep his hands in the bowl. They were still pretty frozen, and he wasn\u2019t about to risk anything. </p><p>\u201cOh look your girlfriend asking if you\u2019re alright after the robbery,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cAw young love at it\u2019s finest,\u201d Clint sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet her kid. I have a lot of stories to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me now,\u201d Peter mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cHate to break it to you kid but you\u2019re staying with us for a long time.</p><p>\u201cOh joy, what fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to choose to ignore the sarcasm there.\u201d</p><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a

He was already grinning at what Natasha would make Bucky wear. </p><p><i>Poke. Something taped his shoulder but he ignored it.</i></p><p>Endless amount of food and desserts? Check. He not only had spider-boy\u2019s metabolism to worry about but also two super soldiers and one god. </p><p><i>Poke. Tony just shrugged it off eyes still glued to his Stark pad. </i></p><p>Is the guest list correct? Check. Much smaller than years before but he wasn\u2019t about to subject his kid to a mass of strangers. Besides, half of the people he usually invited were only there for the bragging rights. </p><p>A finger jabbed his face repeatedly. Tony jolted, eyes landing certain spiderling hanging upside down. He sighed a smirk tugging at his lips as Peter shrugged hands hiding under sweater paws.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you too kiddo,\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou know there are better ways of getting my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said hello when I walked in but you were lost in your own little world to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo jabbing your finger at my face was a better option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I could have dumped water on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would have taken you off the Christmas Eve Eve party guest list.\u201d</p><p>His kid scoffed skill sticking to the ceiling. \u201cYou love me too much to do that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled poking the Spider-Boy back. \u201cYou got me there buddy and besides the team would murder me if I stopped them from meeting your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew red as he dropped to the floor. Tony laughed as the poor kid groaned into his hands remembering what the team told him last night. </p><p>\u201cOh God, they\u2019re going to embarrass me aren\u2019t they.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to team kiddo. You know they mean well.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean Clint\u2019s even going out of his way to buy you two some protection if the need-\u201c</p><p><i>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</i></p><p>Peter\u2019s face grew to the shade of his suit, mouth open in shock. His eyes grew wide as Tony howled in laughter. He shook his head mumbling to himself. </p><p>\u201cI already know Natasha did a background check on MJ but Clint? Oh man, I\u2019m never going to live this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the team last night, they want to get to know her.\u201d</p><p>His kid shook his head groaning as his face remained the same shade of red. To Tony this was all endearing, it took the poor big mouths to even admit he like her let alone to tell it to her face. It was his first real relationship and everyone wanted to make sure he was ok. MJ checked out, but they still wanted to meet her in person.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid, they know not to embarrass you that much. They just like to tease you. Your \u00a0face practically lights up when you talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s perfect, Tony,\u201d Peter whispered into his hands.</p><p>\u201cLoverboy is falling hard I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll change the subject. I\u2019m sure you wanted to tell me something before I mention your girlfriend.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d He said sheepishly fiddling with his hands still hiding underneath his sweater. \u201cJust um don\u2019t freak out.\u201d </p><p>Now more alert, Tony\u2019s smile fell off his face. Worry overtook him as he stared over Peter for any noticeable injuries. He seemed fine but knowing his kid, he could hide injuries pretty well.</p><p>\u201cSo, on my here, there was this robbery and my suit got messed up.\u201d</p><p>He sighed in relief. \u201cPete, I can fix your suit, that\u2019s no big deal-\u201c</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really feel my hands.\u201d</p><p>Tony leaped up from his chair, hands pushing back the sleeve to his kid\u2019s sweater. He gasped at the state of Peter\u2019s hands, red and blistering almost looking frozen. </p><p>\u201cThe dude had some freeze ray and I\u2019m pretty sure I have frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Peter, why didn\u2019t you tell me this first! </p><p>\u201cYou seemed in a good mood and I didn\u2019t want to ruin that.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou have frostbite on your hands! Trust me this takes priority.\u201d </p><p>Peter looked down at the floor. Tony sighed hands gently taking his kid\u2019s. \u201cCome on Pete lets get you fixed up. I\u2019ll even let you pick any movie you want.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cHarry Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll suffer through that.\u201d</p><p>_______</p><p>After a trip to the Med-bay to get a good look at Peter\u2019s hands, Tony was relieved that the frostbite was a mild case. All they had to do is sick his hands in warm water and that should do the trick. And with Peter\u2019s healing, the process would be much quicker. </p><p>Now, they were seated in the living room along with a few other teammates watching Harry Potter. Peter\u2019s hands sat in some warm water as Tony made sure he didn\u2019t take his hands out. Steve was making sure the freeze ray guy was handled and lock away. Serves him right for freezing his kid\u2019s hands. </p><p>\u201cI always loved Christmas at Hogwarts,\u201d Peter said as a few others agreed. </p><p>\u201cYou can literally see the strings that floating candles are attached to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark, stop ruining the illusion!\u201d Peter stuck his tongue out as his phone buzzed. </p><p>Just as he was about to reach it, Tony was quick to keep his hands in the bowl. They were still pretty frozen, and he wasn\u2019t about to risk anything. </p><p>\u201cOh look your girlfriend asking if you\u2019re alright after the robbery,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>\u201cAw young love at it\u2019s finest,\u201d Clint sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet her kid. I have a lot of stories to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me now,\u201d Peter mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cHate to break it to you kid but you\u2019re staying with us for a long time.</p><p>\u201cOh joy, what fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to choose to ignore the sarcasm there.\u201d</p><p>Permanent Tags:</p><p><a
