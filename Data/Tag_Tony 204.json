Why?</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>I\u2019m running out of alternatives. I CANNOT handle picking up dudes in bars anymore.</p><p><b>Tony: </b>Hey, it could be worse. You could live in a place where a man would pay your father in livestock for the right to marry you. You&rsquo;re probably worth, what? Two goats?</p><p><b>Tony:</b> Maybe three.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Excuse you I\u2019m worth at least 4 oxen</p><p><b>Tony:</b> You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re a catch. I&rsquo;ll never understand why you have so much trouble meeting men.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Meeting them is not the issue. I meet many of them. I just want most of them to go away immediately afterwards.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>So, desperate times call for desperate measures</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> I just created a profile for a blind dating website.</p><p><b>Tony:</b> Well, I suppose not all men can be as dashing and charming as I am. Also, BLIND dating?? Just plain old online dating is scary enough. What site are you on? Please tell me it&rsquo;s not creepy. I don&rsquo;t need you out there meeting axe-murderers.</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> Welp, guess I\u2019ll delete my profile off of Axe-Murderers-R-Us then. Way to thin out my dating pool there, Stark.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>I gave MysteryDate.net a try</p><p><b>Tony: </b>I\u2019m electing to ignore your sarcasm. I checked it out and the site seems legit. It&rsquo;s a strange concept though, filling out a profile with all your interests, but no full name and no photo. Seems dangerous&hellip; Maybe I should come with you when you do this.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Ah yes, because bringing my famous, billionaire bestie is sure to set the mood</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but fuck no.</p><p><b>Tony: </b>Oh, come on. I don&rsquo;t bite.</p><p><b>Tony: </b>Well, I don&rsquo;t bite hard.

I&rsquo;ll just be dramatic instead. Oh, please tell me more about this potential douchebag!</p><p><b>Tony: </b>Or I could just hack your account.</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> DO. NOT</p><p><b>Y/N:</b> I will end you!</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>And besides</p><p><b>Tony: </b>You do know that telling me no only makes me want to do it more, right?</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Would you calm your tits?? I\u2019m gonna tell you about him</p><p><b>Tony:</b> Sure, sure. My lips are zipped.

Anyway, please go on. </p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Okay so this dude</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>His profile says he\u2019s a Software Designer. Sounds vague but somewhat cool.</p><p><b>Tony:</b> That&rsquo;s&hellip; too vague. Are you setting up a date?</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Well&hellip;he describes himself as a \u201csensitive romantic\u201d and as much as I hate to admit it, I\u2019m a sucker for romance so yeah, I think I\u2019m gonna message him</p><p><b>Tony:</b> Hmm. You&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t want me to come with you? I could tail you.</p><p><b>Tony: </b>Although\u2026 I&rsquo;m pretty conspicuous no matter where I go.</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>The Empire State Building is less conspicuous than you</p><p><b>Y/N: </b>No thanks, but I appreciate the offer. We&rsquo;re meeting this Friday.</p><p><b>Tony:</b> You have me on speed dial, yeah? In case you need me? Or in case you need to vent about how ridiculously boring he is? </p><p><b>Y/N: </b>Oh, hush.

Shit. The medical suite. Usually he can get there under his own power, so if he wakes up already there\u2026 must have been a bad fight. What was it this time? Aliens? Hydra? Some new hell?</p><p>His head pounds as he opens his eyes to the sterile, white walls and piercing lights. The pain that pierces his skull triggers something: a recollection of driving and\u2026 and someone yelling at him. He groans. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony steadies the glass that presses to his lips and gulps the contents. His stomach roils against the water. Such a familiar feeling. Not a battle, then. At least, not one against any new demons. When he finishes the water, he turns, squinting through crusty eyes at the man next to him. Steve. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You had a blood alcohol level of .30.&rdquo; Tony jerks around at the sound of Rhodey&rsquo;s voice. He hadn&rsquo;t seen him on his first inspection of the room. His expression is as dark as his voice. &ldquo;We had to pump your stomach.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What were you doing driving?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>Oh god, a carousel of bad decision-making. The familiar pit of shame unfurls in his stomach. A thousand lectures roll through his mind. Tony shakes his head to clear the noise, then raises his palm to his temple when that hurts.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be the concussion,&rdquo; Rhodey explains. &ldquo;Still aren&rsquo;t sure how you got it. Care to enlighten us?&rdquo;</p><p>He remembers the yelling. And the brakes pushing themselves. Then the steering wheel rushed at him and everything cut out. &ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You showed up in the garage,&rdquo; Steve says, &ldquo;passed out cold. How did you even make it back?&rdquo;</p><p>Good question. The Lotus can drive itself no problem, but Tony hadn&rsquo;t set the autopilot. You. You must have taken over the car. Oh fuck, fuck, that&rsquo;s wrong in so many ways. Tony raises a hand to his throbbing head.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone called for medical aid,&rdquo; Steve continues. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know who.&rdquo;</p><p>For an AI, you&rsquo;re one hell of a busybody. &ldquo;Must have been FRIDAY,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&lt;You are so full of shit, Stark.&gt;</p><p>The room freezes as Rhodey and Cap look to each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Trying out a new AI?&rdquo; Rhodey asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Blaire told me Tony was working on a new one,&rdquo; Steve answers. &ldquo;She said he built a girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh hell. For someone who can&rsquo;t speak, Blaire sure has a big mouth. &ldquo;She is not my girlfriend,&rdquo; Tony snaps.</p><p>&lt;He did not build me.&gt; Your familiar hologram materializes at Tony&rsquo;s bedside.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, Cheshire,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it later.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Bullshit!&gt; you snap. &lt;We&rsquo;ll talk about it now. I don&rsquo;t take orders from you and, after last night, don&rsquo;t you think for a second that you&rsquo;re in a position to give me any.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony\u2026&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice toes the thin line between confused and concerned.</p><p>You continue as if he hadn&rsquo;t interrupted, crowding into Tony&rsquo;s space. &lt;You took a bath in whiskey and I had to knock your dumb ass out so I could drive you home.&gt;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s temper unravels, his anger at himself lashing out at you because you&rsquo;re a convenient target. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>You match his bark for bite. &lt;I wasn&rsquo;t fucking doing it for you. You can plow your car into the river for all I care.&gt;</p><p>You seem to be on the road to a full-fledged tirade, one that Tony isn&rsquo;t in the mood to share with Steve and Rhodey. &ldquo;FRIDAY, flush the system.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;FRIDAY, don&rsquo;t you fucking d\u2014&gt;</p><p>You vanish with a flicker, leaving Tony alone in the dark with Steve and Rhodey.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>#</p><p>By the time you reassemble yourself and break back through the Avengers&rsquo; firewalls, Tony is out of the medical ward and the team has gathered in a conference room for a heated discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that thing?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. You bristle at his tone.</p><p>Tony sits at the head of the table, his forehead resting against the wood. \u00a0&quot;She\u2014it\u2026 well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly.&ldquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m a person.&gt;</p><p>&quot;Oh, great,&rdquo; Rhodey says. He throws his hands up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Steve speaks this time. His eyebrows knit together. &ldquo;What does it mean: it&rsquo;s &lsquo;a person&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Same thing it means for you,&gt; you say. Now that you&rsquo;ve exposed yourself to the entire team (thanks, Tony), your chances of getting help are quickly diminishing. You don&rsquo;t have time for niceties anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheshire. Just&quot;\u2014Tony lets out a long breath through his nose\u2014&quot;stay out of this right now.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t look up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s nowhere for him to make eye contact.</p><p>&lt;If you&rsquo;re going to be talking about me, I want to take part.&gt;</p><p>He sits up and rubs the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Sure, whatever, but can you shut up for just a second?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m not just some AI that you can\u2014&gt;</p><p>A tingle on the extreme edges of your consciousness distracts you. Before you can investigate, an aggressive push rocks your hold on the system. You recognize the touch. Vision. You\u2019ve never interacted with him directly, but you&rsquo;ve tiptoed around him enough times to recognize the signature.</p><p>You push back with everything you have, overwhelming him and chasing him back into his own mind, maybe a little beyond. Physically, he flinches, dropping to one knee where he had stood. All eyes turn to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Vis?&rdquo;</p><p>He holds his hand up to reassure the woman\u2014Wanda\u2014who had rushed to his aid. &ldquo;It is alright. I attempted to remove the intrusion from the system.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Try it again,&gt; you warn, &lt;and I&rsquo;ll tear you apart.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tony calls to the ceiling. &ldquo;Knock it off.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;ll keep my hands to myself if he does.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just\u2026 figure out what&rsquo;s going on here first,&rdquo; Natasha says.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to figure out?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. &ldquo;Tony, that thing is a menace.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Can you quit trying to kill me? I saved your life.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone starts talking at once, telling Tony what he should do. Prevailing opinion seems to lie with your destruction.</p><p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Tony shouts. The other voices stop. &ldquo;I know it doesn&rsquo;t make sense and it&rsquo;s dangerous and you want me to fix it. I get it. Just let me think for two seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>A ringing silence follows his outburst. For a few moments, only tension fills the air. Natasha is the first to speak again. &ldquo;Tony, what happened?&rdquo; Her voice is gentle, coaxing.</p><p>He takes a few moments to steady himself, then addresses the group again, his tone flat like he&rsquo;s giving a lecture. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman at a long term care facility in Albany. That&rsquo;s who she&quot;\u2014he gestures to the ceiling as if that&rsquo;s where you live\u2014&quot;claims she is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodes chimes in, &ldquo;This is crazy. People can&rsquo;t be computers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They can,&rdquo; Natasha says. &ldquo;Steve and I saw it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve meets her eyes. &ldquo;Zola&rsquo;s lab. At the SHIELD facility. He transferred his mind to a computer bank before he died. They kept him there for decades.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;But I&rsquo;m not dead. My body is still out there, I&rsquo;m just not in it.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. &ldquo;And how did that happen?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony answers before you can give a sharp retort. &ldquo;She was at Helen Cho&rsquo;s facility. Ultron blasted her with the scepter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what gave me and\u2026 Pietro\u2026 our powers,&rdquo; Wanda says from the corner where she stands with her arms crossed. &ldquo;Exposure to the staff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the Infinity Stone,&rdquo; Vision says. Silence falls over the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we actually considering this?&rdquo; Rhodey seems scandalized.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be an oversight to not do so,&rdquo; Vision answers.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if it&rsquo;s another Ultron?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony comes to your defense. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not like Ultron.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just&quot;\u2014he rubs his hand over his face\u2014&quot;She&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dangerous!&rdquo;</p><p>A sharp knock on the table stops the conversation. All eyes turn to the woman\u2014Blaire\u2014sitting next to Steve. [I was dangerous] she signs.</p><p>Steve lays his hand on her arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p><p>Blaire looks to Tony, a combination of confusion and pleading. [she can&rsquo;t control her powers] she insists. [we should help her] The group exchanges uncomfortable glances. [what do you want to do?] Blaire asks Tony.</p><p>Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really okay with me doing this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we said no, would you listen?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smirks, but doesn&rsquo;t answer immediately. He stares at Blaire&rsquo;s pleading face, his expression shifting my millimeters each second. You&rsquo;d hold your breath if you had one. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says finally. &ldquo;I want to help.&rdquo; </p><p>#</p><p>Tony arranges to have your body moved to the Avengers facility. It isn&rsquo;t hard getting permission\u2014your grandmother is all too eager to jump at the chance Tony offers. Which is good, because no normal doctor on earth would sign off on what he&rsquo;s planning. You&rsquo;re braindead and he&rsquo;s going to perform experimental surgery so that a computer program can run a human body. And he&rsquo;s not sure that&rsquo;s possible. He has all of your paperwork, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Tony doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s looking for, but knowing everything has to be a good start, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Physically, she&rsquo;s in incredible shape,&rdquo; Bruce says after he finishes a thorough examination of your body. &ldquo;Considering how long she&rsquo;s been in a coma, she should have experienced significant muscle atrophy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Not nearly as much as she should have. It&rsquo;s similar to\u2014&rdquo; Bruce cuts off, eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce removes his glasses, fiddles with the frames. &ldquo;Did you read the SHEILD files from when they revived Steve?&rdquo; When he looks up from his hands, his eyes pierce through Tony.</p><p>Tony had perused most of SHEILD&rsquo;s files, and paid attention to the ones regarding Rogers in particular, but he didn&rsquo;t see how that was connected to you. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t exactly springing to mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been in the ice for seventy years,&rdquo; Bruce says, as if that explains the connection. Tony lifts an eyebrow, inviting him to continue. &ldquo;Not only did he survive, but he was in the same shape he was when he went under. No rehab required. Even under lab conditions, cryogenics wouldn&rsquo;t have worked that well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The serum?&rdquo; Tony suggests, but his gut tells him no.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think the super soldier serum gets more credit than it should.&rdquo; Bruce reaches for the supplies to draw blood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about this, but I&rsquo;ll look into it. We might have more in common than I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Like what?&gt; you ask. Bruce startles a little and looks around the room as if he could see you. You oblige by shimmering the hologram into view beside him. Tony smiles to himself. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that you&rsquo;re listening when you don&rsquo;t make yourself apparent.</p><p>&ldquo;If Loki&rsquo;s scepter emitted high levels of gamma radiation,&rdquo; Bruce explains, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s possible that you received your powers that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Which would be a common link in all the super-humans suddenly popping up. Steve, Bruce, Wanda, Pietro, Blaire, now you\u2026</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony says, &ldquo;gamma is the key to all this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;ll see what I get back from the blood sample.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, they run the full gamut of exams. Tony has to remove all your piercings so he can run the MRI. There are\u2026 a lot. Every time he thinks he finally has them all, you remind him of another one. Not to mention the tattoos. Is there any part of you that isn&rsquo;t covered in ink? The MRI clicks and whirrs as the images flash on the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal brain, Tony,&rdquo; Bruce says, watching the monitor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t either. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be normal,&rdquo; he says, leaning toward the screen. &ldquo;Not completely. She&rsquo;s not in there.&rdquo; There had to be something the doctors missed. This wasn&rsquo;t a normal case.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, that&rsquo;s why the scan shows no activity.&rdquo; Bruce waves at the screen. &ldquo;Brain death.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m not dead.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as your brain is considered, you are,&rdquo; Bruce corrects you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but is it healthy?&rdquo; Tony asks. Dead or not, he can&rsquo;t put you back if your brain has turned to soup.</p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; Bruce shrugs. &ldquo;In most cases, this is where they would contact the family about organ donation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But there aren&rsquo;t any injuries?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not visible, no.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;So, I should be able to go back in.&gt;</p><p>Bruce sighs. &ldquo;There is no in. Consciousness doesn&rsquo;t just jump in and out of the brain.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Mine did.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you can,&rdquo; Bruce says, though his tone is skeptical, &ldquo;How do you think this is going to work? Once you&rsquo;re in there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The brain runs on electrical pulses,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an organic computer setup, if you think about it. She should be capable of running it, assuming we can make the transfer of consciousness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Theoretically.&rdquo; Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Not sure how you&rsquo;re planning on doing that, but I&rsquo;m guessing it will be brain surgery. Massive brain surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, how else are we going to do it? She needs the connection. If I can create a fine enough mesh, actually integrate her into the cerebral cortex, then she can transfer from the electrical current of the mesh into her own neurons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Theoretically.&rdquo; Bruce sits down in what Tony now recognizes as a weary gesture. &ldquo;Tony, this whole thing is a crapshoot. She&rsquo;s unique. There&rsquo;s no precedent for this sort of transfer. We can&rsquo;t go back on it. It&rsquo;s not like we can make a copy of her. We can&rsquo;t even test it beforehand. If this goes wrong, there&rsquo;s not a second chance. You could fry her brain and destroy both halves of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We managed to stick Jarvis into Vision, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but Vision was an infinity stone. And the body was manufactured in the cradle. He&rsquo;s a synthetic life form. You&rsquo;re trying to shove something synthetic into an organic container. There&rsquo;s no way of knowing if it will preserve her existing consciousness. You could kill her.&rdquo; Bruce runs his hands through his hair. &ldquo;Look, Tony. This kind of neuroscience is way beyond me. I think\u2026 I think you should consider this a little more.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stays in your room long after Bruce leaves, just\u2026 staring at your body. He doesn&rsquo;t see it, per se. He&rsquo;s just thinking, running his thumb absently over the pulse in your wrist. \u00a0</p><p>&lt;What&rsquo;s up, Doc?&gt; Your hologram appears on the edge of your bed, wearing a hospital gown, just like your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Doc?&rdquo; Tony asks. His expertise is more mechanical than medical, even if he is stepping outside his comfort zone for this.</p><p>&lt;You have three doctorates,&gt; you say. &lt;At least one of them should count.&gt; Your hologram shifts, folding her hands in her lap. &lt;Having second thoughts?&gt; You ask. Your tone is nonchalant, even if the question isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Tony stands. It&rsquo;s not\u2026 cold feet or anything like that. The challenge is exhilarating, but the consequences? Tony isn&rsquo;t used to consequences. At least, before the Avengers, he wasn&rsquo;t. Now it feels like every breath he takes is costing lives somewhere. He does something, someone dies. He sits out, someone dies. Buildings fall and democracy crumbles and he used to not worry about those things. Collateral damage. He makes a circuit of the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safer staying where you are.&rdquo; He runs his hands through his hair, mussing it. &ldquo;Bruce is right. There won&rsquo;t be any second chances at this.&rdquo; Collateral damage. Numbers, statistics, death tolls. It&rsquo;s easier to gloss over that way. But you\u2026 you&rsquo;re personal. You&rsquo;re a living, breathing\u2014no, not quite that. You exist and you care. And Tony hadn&rsquo;t realized how much he&rsquo;d grown attached to you.</p><p>&lt;You know,&gt; you say, interrupting the vicious circle that his thoughts run, &lt;I don&rsquo;t remember what bacon tastes like.&gt; Your hologram smirks at him and your body remains still as ever. It&rsquo;s like watching a ghost. &lt;Like, I know that&rsquo;s a stupid example, but can you imagine? Not remembering that? Or what sunlight feels like?&gt; Tony looks down, not able to maintain eye contact, even if the image isn&rsquo;t really you. &lt;This isn&rsquo;t living, Tony. I can&rsquo;t feel anything or touch anything. As far as I know, I won&rsquo;t die\u2014not without help. I don&rsquo;t want to live forever like this.&gt;</p><p>Live forever. You say it like it&rsquo;s a death sentence. Maybe it is. Tony&rsquo;s considered that, not in the same way, of course. But\u2026 what if he outlived everyone he loved? Yeah, he&rsquo;d risk his life too.</p><p>#</p><p>It&rsquo;s amazing to watch Tony work. He goes into a trance, focusing so hard on his task that the rest of the world seems to shut off. His big hands do delicate work, creating the most amazing things out of nothing. Even so, even with his mind at full capacity, the mesh isn&rsquo;t an easy creation. There are too many variables, too many catches and tricks. The brain is sophisticated\u2014hacking it seems to be giving Tony trouble. Days worth of trouble.</p><p>&lt;You should go to bed, Tony,&gt; you say when, once again, it&rsquo;s three in the morning. Tony is still working.</p><p>Tony jerks out of the daze he&rsquo;d fallen into. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;When was the last time you actually slept?&gt; You know when that was, of course. You don&rsquo;t sleep and you have nothing better to do than watch him. It&rsquo;s been thirty-two hours and twenty-six minutes since he took a catnap in the lab. Tony needs sleep. Real sleep. In a bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Don\u2019t you want me to find a solution to your problem?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t see how running yourself into the ground is going to help things. Won&rsquo;t a little rest be better?&gt; Ok, so your motives aren&rsquo;t purely practical, even if you phrase them that way. Sleep would help Tony think better, but you&rsquo;re more concerned with his wellbeing. He isn&rsquo;t a machine, even if the others often treat him that way. They seem to have grown so accustomed to his self-sacrifice that they take it for granted. That&rsquo;s just Tony. He&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep pushing until it comes to me. That&rsquo;s how I work.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course it is. That&rsquo;s the problem. He doesn&rsquo;t see himself as worth caring for. He thinks he&rsquo;s expendable. You cross in front of him and he pulls back instinctively, rolling his chair away so his hands don&rsquo;t pass through you. &lt;Why did you decide to help me?&gt; you ask. It&rsquo;s a distraction, one that might help your cause. But you&rsquo;re also curious. He&rsquo;d been so adamant, but when someone else questioned you, threatened you, he became your greatest defender. &lt;What changed your mind?&gt;</p><p>Tony picks up a screwdriver, then puts it back down. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my responsibility.&rdquo;</p><p>Ok\u2026 not what you were expecting. 'A challenge&rsquo; maybe or 'Because I felt like it&rsquo;. But, you&rsquo;d approached him for help. He didn&rsquo;t owe you anything. &lt;How&rsquo;s that?&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I made Ultron. If it weren&rsquo;t for me, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened to you. Wanda would still have a brother. All those people in Sokovia\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>The way he cuts off, the way he looks down, the only direction where you can&rsquo;t see him directly in the cameras\u2026 he's\u2026 you process the image, searching for comparisons, but it isn&rsquo;t familiar. It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s ashamed. &lt;You wanted to help people.&gt;</p><p>Tony laughs, a dark, self-mocking sound. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. That worked out great.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;You didn&rsquo;t know what would happen.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Because I thought I did.&rdquo; He paces the edge of the lab. &ldquo;I thought I had seen it. I thought that what Wanda put\u2014what I saw\u2014was where we were going. I knew. I knew if I didn&rsquo;t create Ultron, that that&rsquo;s where we would end up. So, I did. And I made something so much worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Tony\u2026&gt; It&rsquo;s not pain\u2014you can&rsquo;t feel pain\u2014but, god, it&rsquo;s so close. You want to touch him. You want to reach through the circuits, the code, anything if it meant you could get to him. You settle for moving the hologram, lifting her hand to cup his cheek. He can&rsquo;t feel it, there&rsquo;s no way he could, but he leans into it just a little. In all your time in this disembodied state, never once have you felt such a powerful need to have your physical form back. You&rsquo;d give anything\u2014everything\u2014if you could reach him. &lt;You&rsquo;re so brave.&gt; It&rsquo;s utterly inadequate. But how are you supposed to describe him? Everything he&rsquo;s sacrificed, everything he&rsquo;s endured\u2014all the suspicious glances from those who are supposed to be his teammates, the accusations, the threats. And all he ever wanted was to keep people safe. </p><p><br/></p><hr><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg7Fi6rDUIym2O5GYxyFUoQ\">@abovethesmokestacks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meJzS93V7QfqwahvSbv2tNg\">@netflixa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdDOisnZxzrngDUNPoHlYvg\">@winterboobaerchen</a></p><p>\n\nIf you would like to be added to (or removed from) the tag list, please let me know.\n\n<br/></p>",

Shit. The medical suite. Usually he can get there under his own power, so if he wakes up already there\u2026 must have been a bad fight. What was it this time? Aliens? Hydra? Some new hell?</p><p>His head pounds as he opens his eyes to the sterile, white walls and piercing lights. The pain that pierces his skull triggers something: a recollection of driving and\u2026 and someone yelling at him. He groans. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Tony steadies the glass that presses to his lips and gulps the contents. His stomach roils against the water. Such a familiar feeling. Not a battle, then. At least, not one against any new demons. When he finishes the water, he turns, squinting through crusty eyes at the man next to him. Steve. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a blood alcohol level of .30.\u201d Tony jerks around at the sound of Rhodey\u2019s voice. He hadn\u2019t seen him on his first inspection of the room. His expression is as dark as his voice. \u201cWe had to pump your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing driving?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>Oh god, a carousel of bad decision-making. The familiar pit of shame unfurls in his stomach. A thousand lectures roll through his mind. Tony shakes his head to clear the noise, then raises his palm to his temple when that hurts.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the concussion,\u201d Rhodey explains. \u201cStill aren\u2019t sure how you got it. Care to enlighten us?\u201d</p><p>He remembers the yelling. And the brakes pushing themselves. Then the steering wheel rushed at him and everything cut out. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou showed up in the garage,\u201d Steve says, \u201cpassed out cold. How did you even make it back?\u201d</p><p>Good question. The Lotus can drive itself no problem, but Tony hadn\u2019t set the autopilot. You. You must have taken over the car. Oh fuck, fuck, that\u2019s wrong in so many ways. Tony raises a hand to his throbbing head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone called for medical aid,\u201d Steve continues. \u201cDon\u2019t know who.\u201d</p><p>For an AI, you\u2019re one hell of a busybody. \u201cMust have been FRIDAY,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>&lt;You are so full of shit, Stark.&gt;</p><p>The room freezes as Rhodey and Cap look to each other.</p><p>\u201cTrying out a new AI?\u201d Rhodey asks.</p><p>\u201cBlaire told me Tony was working on a new one,\u201d Steve answers. \u201cShe said he built a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. For someone who can\u2019t speak, Blaire sure has a big mouth. \u201cShe is not my girlfriend,\u201d Tony snaps.</p><p>&lt;He did not build me.&gt; Your familiar hologram materializes at Tony\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Cheshire,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Bullshit!&gt; you snap. &lt;We\u2019ll talk about it now. I don\u2019t take orders from you and, after last night, don\u2019t you think for a second that you\u2019re in a position to give me any.&gt;</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d Steve\u2019s voice toes the thin line between confused and concerned.</p><p>You continue as if he hadn\u2019t interrupted, crowding into Tony\u2019s space. &lt;You took a bath in whiskey and I had to knock your dumb ass out so I could drive you home.&gt;</p><p>Tony\u2019s temper unravels, his anger at himself lashing out at you because you\u2019re a convenient target. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d</p><p>You match his bark for bite. &lt;I wasn\u2019t fucking doing it for you. You can plow your car into the river for all I care.&gt;</p><p>You seem to be on the road to a full-fledged tirade, one that Tony isn\u2019t in the mood to share with Steve and Rhodey. \u201cFRIDAY, flush the system.\u201d</p><p>&lt;FRIDAY, don\u2019t you fucking d\u2014&gt;</p><p>You vanish with a flicker, leaving Tony alone in the dark with Steve and Rhodey.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>#</p><p>By the time you reassemble yourself and break back through the Avengers\u2019 firewalls, Tony is out of the medical ward and the team has gathered in a conference room for a heated discussion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Rhodey asks. You bristle at his tone.</p><p>Tony sits at the head of the table, his forehead resting against the wood. \u00a0\"She\u2014it\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201c</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m a person.&gt;</p><p>\"Oh, great,\u201d Rhodey says. He throws his hands up. \u201cIt\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve speaks this time. His eyebrows knit together. \u201cWhat does it mean: it\u2019s \u2018a person\u2019?\u201d</p><p>&lt;Same thing it means for you,&gt; you say. Now that you\u2019ve exposed yourself to the entire team (thanks, Tony), your chances of getting help are quickly diminishing. You don\u2019t have time for niceties anymore.</p><p>\u201cCheshire. Just\"\u2014Tony lets out a long breath through his nose\u2014\"stay out of this right now.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look up. It doesn\u2019t matter, there\u2019s nowhere for him to make eye contact.</p><p>&lt;If you\u2019re going to be talking about me, I want to take part.&gt;</p><p>He sits up and rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cSure, whatever, but can you shut up for just a second?\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m not just some AI that you can\u2014&gt;</p><p>A tingle on the extreme edges of your consciousness distracts you. Before you can investigate, an aggressive push rocks your hold on the system. You recognize the touch. Vision. You\u2019ve never interacted with him directly, but you\u2019ve tiptoed around him enough times to recognize the signature.</p><p>You push back with everything you have, overwhelming him and chasing him back into his own mind, maybe a little beyond. Physically, he flinches, dropping to one knee where he had stood. All eyes turn to him.</p><p>\u201cVis?\u201d</p><p>He holds his hand up to reassure the woman\u2014Wanda\u2014who had rushed to his aid. \u201cIt is alright. I attempted to remove the intrusion from the system.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Try it again,&gt; you warn, &lt;and I\u2019ll tear you apart.&gt;</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony calls to the ceiling. \u201cKnock it off.\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019ll keep my hands to myself if he does.&gt;</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just\u2026 figure out what\u2019s going on here first,\u201d Natasha says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to figure out?\u201d Rhodey asks. \u201cTony, that thing is a menace.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Can you quit trying to kill me? I saved your life.&gt;</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Everyone starts talking at once, telling Tony what he should do. Prevailing opinion seems to lie with your destruction.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Tony shouts. The other voices stop. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make sense and it\u2019s dangerous and you want me to fix it. I get it. Just let me think for two seconds.\u201d</p><p>A ringing silence follows his outburst. For a few moments, only tension fills the air. Natasha is the first to speak again. \u201cTony, what happened?\u201d Her voice is gentle, coaxing.</p><p>He takes a few moments to steady himself, then addresses the group again, his tone flat like he\u2019s giving a lecture. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman at a long term care facility in Albany. That\u2019s who she\"\u2014he gestures to the ceiling as if that\u2019s where you live\u2014\"claims she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes chimes in, \u201cThis is crazy. People can\u2019t be computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cSteve and I saw it.\u201d</p><p>Steve meets her eyes. \u201cZola\u2019s lab. At the SHIELD facility. He transferred his mind to a computer bank before he died. They kept him there for decades.\u201d</p><p>&lt;But I\u2019m not dead. My body is still out there, I\u2019m just not in it.&gt;</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Rhodey asks. \u201cAnd how did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Tony answers before you can give a sharp retort. \u201cShe was at Helen Cho\u2019s facility. Ultron blasted her with the scepter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what gave me and\u2026 Pietro\u2026 our powers,\u201d Wanda says from the corner where she stands with her arms crossed. \u201cExposure to the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Infinity Stone,\u201d Vision says. Silence falls over the room.</p><p>\u201cAre we actually considering this?\u201d Rhodey seems scandalized.</p><p>\u201cIt would be an oversight to not do so,\u201d Vision answers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s another Ultron?\u201d</p><p>Tony comes to your defense. \u201cShe\u2019s not like Ultron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\"\u2014he rubs his hand over his face\u2014\"She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>A sharp knock on the table stops the conversation. All eyes turn to the woman\u2014Blaire\u2014sitting next to Steve. [I was dangerous] she signs.</p><p>Steve lays his hand on her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>Blaire looks to Tony, a combination of confusion and pleading. [she can\u2019t control her powers] she insists. [we should help her] The group exchanges uncomfortable glances. [what do you want to do?] Blaire asks Tony.</p><p>Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve. \u201cYou\u2019re really okay with me doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we said no, would you listen?\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, but doesn\u2019t answer immediately. He stares at Blaire\u2019s pleading face, his expression shifting my millimeters each second. You\u2019d hold your breath if you had one. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI want to help.\u201d </p><p>#</p><p>Tony arranges to have your body moved to the Avengers facility. It isn\u2019t hard getting permission\u2014your grandmother is all too eager to jump at the chance Tony offers. Which is good, because no normal doctor on earth would sign off on what he\u2019s planning. You\u2019re braindead and he\u2019s going to perform experimental surgery so that a computer program can run a human body. And he\u2019s not sure that\u2019s possible. He has all of your paperwork, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Tony doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s looking for, but knowing everything has to be a good start, right?</p><p>\u201cPhysically, she\u2019s in incredible shape,\u201d Bruce says after he finishes a thorough examination of your body. \u201cConsidering how long she\u2019s been in a coma, she should have experienced significant muscle atrophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as she should have. It\u2019s similar to\u2014\u201d Bruce cuts off, eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Bruce removes his glasses, fiddles with the frames. \u201cDid you read the SHEILD files from when they revived Steve?\u201d When he looks up from his hands, his eyes pierce through Tony.</p><p>Tony had perused most of SHEILD\u2019s files, and paid attention to the ones regarding Rogers in particular, but he didn\u2019t see how that was connected to you. \u201cThey aren\u2019t exactly springing to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been in the ice for seventy years,\u201d Bruce says, as if that explains the connection. Tony lifts an eyebrow, inviting him to continue. \u201cNot only did he survive, but he was in the same shape he was when he went under. No rehab required. Even under lab conditions, cryogenics wouldn\u2019t have worked that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe serum?\u201d Tony suggests, but his gut tells him no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think the super soldier serum gets more credit than it should.\u201d Bruce reaches for the supplies to draw blood. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this, but I\u2019ll look into it. We might have more in common than I thought.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Like what?&gt; you ask. Bruce startles a little and looks around the room as if he could see you. You oblige by shimmering the hologram into view beside him. Tony smiles to himself. It\u2019s easy to forget that you\u2019re listening when you don\u2019t make yourself apparent.</p><p>\u201cIf Loki\u2019s scepter emitted high levels of gamma radiation,\u201d Bruce explains, \u201cit\u2019s possible that you received your powers that way.\u201d</p><p>Which would be a common link in all the super-humans suddenly popping up. Steve, Bruce, Wanda, Pietro, Blaire, now you\u2026</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony says, \u201cgamma is the key to all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll see what I get back from the blood sample.\u201d</p><p>In the meantime, they run the full gamut of exams. Tony has to remove all your piercings so he can run the MRI. There are\u2026 a lot. Every time he thinks he finally has them all, you remind him of another one. Not to mention the tattoos. Is there any part of you that isn\u2019t covered in ink? The MRI clicks and whirrs as the images flash on the screen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a normal brain, Tony,\u201d Bruce says, watching the monitor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t either. \u201cIt can\u2019t be normal,\u201d he says, leaning toward the screen. \u201cNot completely. She\u2019s not in there.\u201d There had to be something the doctors missed. This wasn\u2019t a normal case.</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s why the scan shows no activity.\u201d Bruce waves at the screen. \u201cBrain death.\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m not dead.&gt;</p><p>\u201cAs far as your brain is considered, you are,\u201d Bruce corrects you.</p><p>\u201cYes, but is it healthy?\u201d Tony asks. Dead or not, he can\u2019t put you back if your brain has turned to soup.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Bruce shrugs. \u201cIn most cases, this is where they would contact the family about organ donation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there aren\u2019t any injuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot visible, no.\u201d</p><p>&lt;So, I should be able to go back in.&gt;</p><p>Bruce sighs. \u201cThere is no in. Consciousness doesn\u2019t just jump in and out of the brain.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Mine did.&gt;</p><p>\u201cEven if you can,\u201d Bruce says, though his tone is skeptical, \u201cHow do you think this is going to work? Once you\u2019re in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brain runs on electrical pulses,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIt\u2019s an organic computer setup, if you think about it. She should be capable of running it, assuming we can make the transfer of consciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cNot sure how you\u2019re planning on doing that, but I\u2019m guessing it will be brain surgery. Massive brain surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how else are we going to do it? She needs the connection. If I can create a fine enough mesh, actually integrate her into the cerebral cortex, then she can transfer from the electrical current of the mesh into her own neurons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d Bruce sits down in what Tony now recognizes as a weary gesture. \u201cTony, this whole thing is a crapshoot. She\u2019s unique. There\u2019s no precedent for this sort of transfer. We can\u2019t go back on it. It\u2019s not like we can make a copy of her. We can\u2019t even test it beforehand. If this goes wrong, there\u2019s not a second chance. You could fry her brain and destroy both halves of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe managed to stick Jarvis into Vision, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Vision was an infinity stone. And the body was manufactured in the cradle. He\u2019s a synthetic life form. You\u2019re trying to shove something synthetic into an organic container. There\u2019s no way of knowing if it will preserve her existing consciousness. You could kill her.\u201d Bruce runs his hands through his hair. \u201cLook, Tony. This kind of neuroscience is way beyond me. I think\u2026 I think you should consider this a little more.\u201d</p><p>Tony stays in your room long after Bruce leaves, just\u2026 staring at your body. He doesn\u2019t see it, per se. He\u2019s just thinking, running his thumb absently over the pulse in your wrist. \u00a0</p><p>&lt;What\u2019s up, Doc?&gt; Your hologram appears on the edge of your bed, wearing a hospital gown, just like your body.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d Tony asks. His expertise is more mechanical than medical, even if he is stepping outside his comfort zone for this.</p><p>&lt;You have three doctorates,&gt; you say. &lt;At least one of them should count.&gt; Your hologram shifts, folding her hands in her lap. &lt;Having second thoughts?&gt; You ask. Your tone is nonchalant, even if the question isn\u2019t.</p><p>Tony stands. It\u2019s not\u2026 cold feet or anything like that. The challenge is exhilarating, but the consequences? Tony isn\u2019t used to consequences. At least, before the Avengers, he wasn\u2019t. Now it feels like every breath he takes is costing lives somewhere. He does something, someone dies. He sits out, someone dies. Buildings fall and democracy crumbles and he used to not worry about those things. Collateral damage. He makes a circuit of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re safer staying where you are.\u201d He runs his hands through his hair, mussing it. \u201cBruce is right. There won\u2019t be any second chances at this.\u201d Collateral damage. Numbers, statistics, death tolls. It\u2019s easier to gloss over that way. But you\u2026 you\u2019re personal. You\u2019re a living, breathing\u2014no, not quite that. You exist and you care. And Tony hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d grown attached to you.</p><p>&lt;You know,&gt; you say, interrupting the vicious circle that his thoughts run, &lt;I don\u2019t remember what bacon tastes like.&gt; Your hologram smirks at him and your body remains still as ever. It\u2019s like watching a ghost. &lt;Like, I know that\u2019s a stupid example, but can you imagine? Not remembering that? Or what sunlight feels like?&gt; Tony looks down, not able to maintain eye contact, even if the image isn\u2019t really you. &lt;This isn\u2019t living, Tony. I can\u2019t feel anything or touch anything. As far as I know, I won\u2019t die\u2014not without help. I don\u2019t want to live forever like this.&gt;</p><p>Live forever. You say it like it\u2019s a death sentence. Maybe it is. Tony\u2019s considered that, not in the same way, of course. But\u2026 what if he outlived everyone he loved? Yeah, he\u2019d risk his life too.</p><p>#</p><p>It\u2019s amazing to watch Tony work. He goes into a trance, focusing so hard on his task that the rest of the world seems to shut off. His big hands do delicate work, creating the most amazing things out of nothing. Even so, even with his mind at full capacity, the mesh isn\u2019t an easy creation. There are too many variables, too many catches and tricks. The brain is sophisticated\u2014hacking it seems to be giving Tony trouble. Days worth of trouble.</p><p>&lt;You should go to bed, Tony,&gt; you say when, once again, it\u2019s three in the morning. Tony is still working.</p><p>Tony jerks out of the daze he\u2019d fallen into. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>&lt;When was the last time you actually slept?&gt; You know when that was, of course. You don\u2019t sleep and you have nothing better to do than watch him. It\u2019s been thirty-two hours and twenty-six minutes since he took a catnap in the lab. Tony needs sleep. Real sleep. In a bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t you want me to find a solution to your problem?\u201d</p><p>&lt;Yeah, but I don\u2019t see how running yourself into the ground is going to help things. Won\u2019t a little rest be better?&gt; Ok, so your motives aren\u2019t purely practical, even if you phrase them that way. Sleep would help Tony think better, but you\u2019re more concerned with his wellbeing. He isn\u2019t a machine, even if the others often treat him that way. They seem to have grown so accustomed to his self-sacrifice that they take it for granted. That\u2019s just Tony. He\u2019ll do whatever it takes.</p><p>\u201cI keep pushing until it comes to me. That\u2019s how I work.\u201d</p><p>Of course it is. That\u2019s the problem. He doesn\u2019t see himself as worth caring for. He thinks he\u2019s expendable. You cross in front of him and he pulls back instinctively, rolling his chair away so his hands don\u2019t pass through you. &lt;Why did you decide to help me?&gt; you ask. It\u2019s a distraction, one that might help your cause. But you\u2019re also curious. He\u2019d been so adamant, but when someone else questioned you, threatened you, he became your greatest defender. &lt;What changed your mind?&gt;</p><p>Tony picks up a screwdriver, then puts it back down. \u201cYou\u2019re my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Ok\u2026 not what you were expecting. 'A challenge\u2019 maybe or 'Because I felt like it\u2019. But, you\u2019d approached him for help. He didn\u2019t owe you anything. &lt;How\u2019s that?&gt;</p><p>\u201cI made Ultron. If it weren\u2019t for me, this wouldn\u2019t have happened to you. Wanda would still have a brother. All those people in Sokovia\u2014\u201d</p><p>The way he cuts off, the way he looks down, the only direction where you can\u2019t see him directly in the cameras\u2026 he's\u2026 you process the image, searching for comparisons, but it isn\u2019t familiar. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s ashamed. &lt;You wanted to help people.&gt;</p><p>Tony laughs, a dark, self-mocking sound. \u201cOh, yeah. That worked out great.\u201d</p><p>&lt;You didn\u2019t know what would happen.&gt;</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I thought I did.\u201d He paces the edge of the lab. \u201cI thought I had seen it. I thought that what Wanda put\u2014what I saw\u2014was where we were going. I knew. I knew if I didn\u2019t create Ultron, that that\u2019s where we would end up. So, I did. And I made something so much worse.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Tony\u2026&gt; It\u2019s not pain\u2014you can\u2019t feel pain\u2014but, god, it\u2019s so close. You want to touch him. You want to reach through the circuits, the code, anything if it meant you could get to him. You settle for moving the hologram, lifting her hand to cup his cheek. He can\u2019t feel it, there\u2019s no way he could, but he leans into it just a little. In all your time in this disembodied state, never once have you felt such a powerful need to have your physical form back. You\u2019d give anything\u2014everything\u2014if you could reach him. &lt;You\u2019re so brave.&gt; It\u2019s utterly inadequate. But how are you supposed to describe him? Everything he\u2019s sacrificed, everything he\u2019s endured\u2014all the suspicious glances from those who are supposed to be his teammates, the accusations, the threats. And all he ever wanted was to keep people safe. </p><p><br></p><hr><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg7Fi6rDUIym2O5GYxyFUoQ\">@abovethesmokestacks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meJzS93V7QfqwahvSbv2tNg\">@netflixa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdDOisnZxzrngDUNPoHlYvg\">@winterboobaerchen</a></p><p>\n\nIf you would like to be added to (or removed from) the tag list, please let me know.\n\n<br></p>",

Shit. The medical suite. Usually he can get there under his own power, so if he wakes up already there\u2026 must have been a bad fight. What was it this time? Aliens? Hydra? Some new hell?</p><p>His head pounds as he opens his eyes to the sterile, white walls and piercing lights. The pain that pierces his skull triggers something: a recollection of driving and\u2026 and someone yelling at him. He groans. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Tony steadies the glass that presses to his lips and gulps the contents. His stomach roils against the water. Such a familiar feeling. Not a battle, then. At least, not one against any new demons. When he finishes the water, he turns, squinting through crusty eyes at the man next to him. Steve. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a blood alcohol level of .30.\u201d Tony jerks around at the sound of Rhodey\u2019s voice. He hadn\u2019t seen him on his first inspection of the room. His expression is as dark as his voice. \u201cWe had to pump your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing driving?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>Oh god, a carousel of bad decision-making. The familiar pit of shame unfurls in his stomach. A thousand lectures roll through his mind. Tony shakes his head to clear the noise, then raises his palm to his temple when that hurts.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the concussion,\u201d Rhodey explains. \u201cStill aren\u2019t sure how you got it. Care to enlighten us?\u201d</p><p>He remembers the yelling. And the brakes pushing themselves. Then the steering wheel rushed at him and everything cut out. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou showed up in the garage,\u201d Steve says, \u201cpassed out cold. How did you even make it back?\u201d</p><p>Good question. The Lotus can drive itself no problem, but Tony hadn\u2019t set the autopilot. You. You must have taken over the car. Oh fuck, fuck, that\u2019s wrong in so many ways. Tony raises a hand to his throbbing head.</p><p>\u201cSomeone called for medical aid,\u201d Steve continues. \u201cDon\u2019t know who.\u201d</p><p>For an AI, you\u2019re one hell of a busybody. \u201cMust have been FRIDAY,\u201d Tony says.</p><p>&lt;You are so full of shit, Stark.&gt;</p><p>The room freezes as Rhodey and Cap look to each other.</p><p>\u201cTrying out a new AI?\u201d Rhodey asks.</p><p>\u201cBlaire told me Tony was working on a new one,\u201d Steve answers. \u201cShe said he built a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Oh hell. For someone who can\u2019t speak, Blaire sure has a big mouth. \u201cShe is not my girlfriend,\u201d Tony snaps.</p><p>&lt;He did not build me.&gt; Your familiar hologram materializes at Tony\u2019s bedside.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Cheshire,\u201d Tony says. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Bullshit!&gt; you snap. &lt;We\u2019ll talk about it now. I don\u2019t take orders from you and, after last night, don\u2019t you think for a second that you\u2019re in a position to give me any.&gt;</p><p>\u201cTony\u2026\u201d Steve\u2019s voice toes the thin line between confused and concerned.</p><p>You continue as if he hadn\u2019t interrupted, crowding into Tony\u2019s space. &lt;You took a bath in whiskey and I had to knock your dumb ass out so I could drive you home.&gt;</p><p>Tony\u2019s temper unravels, his anger at himself lashing out at you because you\u2019re a convenient target. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d</p><p>You match his bark for bite. &lt;I wasn\u2019t fucking doing it for you. You can plow your car into the river for all I care.&gt;</p><p>You seem to be on the road to a full-fledged tirade, one that Tony isn\u2019t in the mood to share with Steve and Rhodey. \u201cFRIDAY, flush the system.\u201d</p><p>&lt;FRIDAY, don\u2019t you fucking d\u2014&gt;</p><p>You vanish with a flicker, leaving Tony alone in the dark with Steve and Rhodey.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>#</p><p>By the time you reassemble yourself and break back through the Avengers\u2019 firewalls, Tony is out of the medical ward and the team has gathered in a conference room for a heated discussion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d Rhodey asks. You bristle at his tone.</p><p>Tony sits at the head of the table, his forehead resting against the wood. \u00a0\"She\u2014it\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know exactly.\u201c</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m a person.&gt;</p><p>\"Oh, great,\u201d Rhodey says. He throws his hands up. \u201cIt\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Steve speaks this time. His eyebrows knit together. \u201cWhat does it mean: it\u2019s \u2018a person\u2019?\u201d</p><p>&lt;Same thing it means for you,&gt; you say. Now that you\u2019ve exposed yourself to the entire team (thanks, Tony), your chances of getting help are quickly diminishing. You don\u2019t have time for niceties anymore.</p><p>\u201cCheshire. Just\"\u2014Tony lets out a long breath through his nose\u2014\"stay out of this right now.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look up. It doesn\u2019t matter, there\u2019s nowhere for him to make eye contact.</p><p>&lt;If you\u2019re going to be talking about me, I want to take part.&gt;</p><p>He sits up and rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cSure, whatever, but can you shut up for just a second?\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m not just some AI that you can\u2014&gt;</p><p>A tingle on the extreme edges of your consciousness distracts you. Before you can investigate, an aggressive push rocks your hold on the system. You recognize the touch. Vision. You\u2019ve never interacted with him directly, but you\u2019ve tiptoed around him enough times to recognize the signature.</p><p>You push back with everything you have, overwhelming him and chasing him back into his own mind, maybe a little beyond. Physically, he flinches, dropping to one knee where he had stood. All eyes turn to him.</p><p>\u201cVis?\u201d</p><p>He holds his hand up to reassure the woman\u2014Wanda\u2014who had rushed to his aid. \u201cIt is alright. I attempted to remove the intrusion from the system.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Try it again,&gt; you warn, &lt;and I\u2019ll tear you apart.&gt;</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tony calls to the ceiling. \u201cKnock it off.\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019ll keep my hands to myself if he does.&gt;</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just\u2026 figure out what\u2019s going on here first,\u201d Natasha says.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to figure out?\u201d Rhodey asks. \u201cTony, that thing is a menace.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Can you quit trying to kill me? I saved your life.&gt;</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>Everyone starts talking at once, telling Tony what he should do. Prevailing opinion seems to lie with your destruction.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Tony shouts. The other voices stop. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t make sense and it\u2019s dangerous and you want me to fix it. I get it. Just let me think for two seconds.\u201d</p><p>A ringing silence follows his outburst. For a few moments, only tension fills the air. Natasha is the first to speak again. \u201cTony, what happened?\u201d Her voice is gentle, coaxing.</p><p>He takes a few moments to steady himself, then addresses the group again, his tone flat like he\u2019s giving a lecture. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman at a long term care facility in Albany. That\u2019s who she\"\u2014he gestures to the ceiling as if that\u2019s where you live\u2014\"claims she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Steve asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Rhodes chimes in, \u201cThis is crazy. People can\u2019t be computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cSteve and I saw it.\u201d</p><p>Steve meets her eyes. \u201cZola\u2019s lab. At the SHIELD facility. He transferred his mind to a computer bank before he died. They kept him there for decades.\u201d</p><p>&lt;But I\u2019m not dead. My body is still out there, I\u2019m just not in it.&gt;</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Rhodey asks. \u201cAnd how did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Tony answers before you can give a sharp retort. \u201cShe was at Helen Cho\u2019s facility. Ultron blasted her with the scepter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what gave me and\u2026 Pietro\u2026 our powers,\u201d Wanda says from the corner where she stands with her arms crossed. \u201cExposure to the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Infinity Stone,\u201d Vision says. Silence falls over the room.</p><p>\u201cAre we actually considering this?\u201d Rhodey seems scandalized.</p><p>\u201cIt would be an oversight to not do so,\u201d Vision answers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s another Ultron?\u201d</p><p>Tony comes to your defense. \u201cShe\u2019s not like Ultron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\"\u2014he rubs his hand over his face\u2014\"She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>A sharp knock on the table stops the conversation. All eyes turn to the woman\u2014Blaire\u2014sitting next to Steve. [I was dangerous] she signs.</p><p>Steve lays his hand on her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>Blaire looks to Tony, a combination of confusion and pleading. [she can\u2019t control her powers] she insists. [we should help her] The group exchanges uncomfortable glances. [what do you want to do?] Blaire asks Tony.</p><p>Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve. \u201cYou\u2019re really okay with me doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we said no, would you listen?\u201d</p><p>Tony smirks, but doesn\u2019t answer immediately. He stares at Blaire\u2019s pleading face, his expression shifting my millimeters each second. You\u2019d hold your breath if you had one. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI want to help.\u201d </p><p>#</p><p>Tony arranges to have your body moved to the Avengers facility. It isn\u2019t hard getting permission\u2014your grandmother is all too eager to jump at the chance Tony offers. Which is good, because no normal doctor on earth would sign off on what he\u2019s planning. You\u2019re braindead and he\u2019s going to perform experimental surgery so that a computer program can run a human body. And he\u2019s not sure that\u2019s possible. He has all of your paperwork, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Tony doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s looking for, but knowing everything has to be a good start, right?</p><p>\u201cPhysically, she\u2019s in incredible shape,\u201d Bruce says after he finishes a thorough examination of your body. \u201cConsidering how long she\u2019s been in a coma, she should have experienced significant muscle atrophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t?\u201d Tony asks.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as she should have. It\u2019s similar to\u2014\u201d Bruce cuts off, eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Bruce removes his glasses, fiddles with the frames. \u201cDid you read the SHEILD files from when they revived Steve?\u201d When he looks up from his hands, his eyes pierce through Tony.</p><p>Tony had perused most of SHEILD\u2019s files, and paid attention to the ones regarding Rogers in particular, but he didn\u2019t see how that was connected to you. \u201cThey aren\u2019t exactly springing to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d been in the ice for seventy years,\u201d Bruce says, as if that explains the connection. Tony lifts an eyebrow, inviting him to continue. \u201cNot only did he survive, but he was in the same shape he was when he went under. No rehab required. Even under lab conditions, cryogenics wouldn\u2019t have worked that well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe serum?\u201d Tony suggests, but his gut tells him no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think the super soldier serum gets more credit than it should.\u201d Bruce reaches for the supplies to draw blood. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this, but I\u2019ll look into it. We might have more in common than I thought.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Like what?&gt; you ask. Bruce startles a little and looks around the room as if he could see you. You oblige by shimmering the hologram into view beside him. Tony smiles to himself. It\u2019s easy to forget that you\u2019re listening when you don\u2019t make yourself apparent.</p><p>\u201cIf Loki\u2019s scepter emitted high levels of gamma radiation,\u201d Bruce explains, \u201cit\u2019s possible that you received your powers that way.\u201d</p><p>Which would be a common link in all the super-humans suddenly popping up. Steve, Bruce, Wanda, Pietro, Blaire, now you\u2026</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Tony says, \u201cgamma is the key to all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll see what I get back from the blood sample.\u201d</p><p>In the meantime, they run the full gamut of exams. Tony has to remove all your piercings so he can run the MRI. There are\u2026 a lot. Every time he thinks he finally has them all, you remind him of another one. Not to mention the tattoos. Is there any part of you that isn\u2019t covered in ink? The MRI clicks and whirrs as the images flash on the screen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a normal brain, Tony,\u201d Bruce says, watching the monitor. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t either. \u201cIt can\u2019t be normal,\u201d he says, leaning toward the screen. \u201cNot completely. She\u2019s not in there.\u201d There had to be something the doctors missed. This wasn\u2019t a normal case.</p><p>\u201cRight, that\u2019s why the scan shows no activity.\u201d Bruce waves at the screen. \u201cBrain death.\u201d</p><p>&lt;I\u2019m not dead.&gt;</p><p>\u201cAs far as your brain is considered, you are,\u201d Bruce corrects you.</p><p>\u201cYes, but is it healthy?\u201d Tony asks. Dead or not, he can\u2019t put you back if your brain has turned to soup.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Bruce shrugs. \u201cIn most cases, this is where they would contact the family about organ donation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there aren\u2019t any injuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot visible, no.\u201d</p><p>&lt;So, I should be able to go back in.&gt;</p><p>Bruce sighs. \u201cThere is no in. Consciousness doesn\u2019t just jump in and out of the brain.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Mine did.&gt;</p><p>\u201cEven if you can,\u201d Bruce says, though his tone is skeptical, \u201cHow do you think this is going to work? Once you\u2019re in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brain runs on electrical pulses,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIt\u2019s an organic computer setup, if you think about it. She should be capable of running it, assuming we can make the transfer of consciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cNot sure how you\u2019re planning on doing that, but I\u2019m guessing it will be brain surgery. Massive brain surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how else are we going to do it? She needs the connection. If I can create a fine enough mesh, actually integrate her into the cerebral cortex, then she can transfer from the electrical current of the mesh into her own neurons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d Bruce sits down in what Tony now recognizes as a weary gesture. \u201cTony, this whole thing is a crapshoot. She\u2019s unique. There\u2019s no precedent for this sort of transfer. We can\u2019t go back on it. It\u2019s not like we can make a copy of her. We can\u2019t even test it beforehand. If this goes wrong, there\u2019s not a second chance. You could fry her brain and destroy both halves of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe managed to stick Jarvis into Vision, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Vision was an infinity stone. And the body was manufactured in the cradle. He\u2019s a synthetic life form. You\u2019re trying to shove something synthetic into an organic container. There\u2019s no way of knowing if it will preserve her existing consciousness. You could kill her.\u201d Bruce runs his hands through his hair. \u201cLook, Tony. This kind of neuroscience is way beyond me. I think\u2026 I think you should consider this a little more.\u201d</p><p>Tony stays in your room long after Bruce leaves, just\u2026 staring at your body. He doesn\u2019t see it, per se. He\u2019s just thinking, running his thumb absently over the pulse in your wrist. \u00a0</p><p>&lt;What\u2019s up, Doc?&gt; Your hologram appears on the edge of your bed, wearing a hospital gown, just like your body.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d Tony asks. His expertise is more mechanical than medical, even if he is stepping outside his comfort zone for this.</p><p>&lt;You have three doctorates,&gt; you say. &lt;At least one of them should count.&gt; Your hologram shifts, folding her hands in her lap. &lt;Having second thoughts?&gt; You ask. Your tone is nonchalant, even if the question isn\u2019t.</p><p>Tony stands. It\u2019s not\u2026 cold feet or anything like that. The challenge is exhilarating, but the consequences? Tony isn\u2019t used to consequences. At least, before the Avengers, he wasn\u2019t. Now it feels like every breath he takes is costing lives somewhere. He does something, someone dies. He sits out, someone dies. Buildings fall and democracy crumbles and he used to not worry about those things. Collateral damage. He makes a circuit of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re safer staying where you are.\u201d He runs his hands through his hair, mussing it. \u201cBruce is right. There won\u2019t be any second chances at this.\u201d Collateral damage. Numbers, statistics, death tolls. It\u2019s easier to gloss over that way. But you\u2026 you\u2019re personal. You\u2019re a living, breathing\u2014no, not quite that. You exist and you care. And Tony hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d grown attached to you.</p><p>&lt;You know,&gt; you say, interrupting the vicious circle that his thoughts run, &lt;I don\u2019t remember what bacon tastes like.&gt; Your hologram smirks at him and your body remains still as ever. It\u2019s like watching a ghost. &lt;Like, I know that\u2019s a stupid example, but can you imagine? Not remembering that? Or what sunlight feels like?&gt; Tony looks down, not able to maintain eye contact, even if the image isn\u2019t really you. &lt;This isn\u2019t living, Tony. I can\u2019t feel anything or touch anything. As far as I know, I won\u2019t die\u2014not without help. I don\u2019t want to live forever like this.&gt;</p><p>Live forever. You say it like it\u2019s a death sentence. Maybe it is. Tony\u2019s considered that, not in the same way, of course. But\u2026 what if he outlived everyone he loved? Yeah, he\u2019d risk his life too.</p><p>#</p><p>It\u2019s amazing to watch Tony work. He goes into a trance, focusing so hard on his task that the rest of the world seems to shut off. His big hands do delicate work, creating the most amazing things out of nothing. Even so, even with his mind at full capacity, the mesh isn\u2019t an easy creation. There are too many variables, too many catches and tricks. The brain is sophisticated\u2014hacking it seems to be giving Tony trouble. Days worth of trouble.</p><p>&lt;You should go to bed, Tony,&gt; you say when, once again, it\u2019s three in the morning. Tony is still working.</p><p>Tony jerks out of the daze he\u2019d fallen into. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>&lt;When was the last time you actually slept?&gt; You know when that was, of course. You don\u2019t sleep and you have nothing better to do than watch him. It\u2019s been thirty-two hours and twenty-six minutes since he took a catnap in the lab. Tony needs sleep. Real sleep. In a bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t you want me to find a solution to your problem?\u201d</p><p>&lt;Yeah, but I don\u2019t see how running yourself into the ground is going to help things. Won\u2019t a little rest be better?&gt; Ok, so your motives aren\u2019t purely practical, even if you phrase them that way. Sleep would help Tony think better, but you\u2019re more concerned with his wellbeing. He isn\u2019t a machine, even if the others often treat him that way. They seem to have grown so accustomed to his self-sacrifice that they take it for granted. That\u2019s just Tony. He\u2019ll do whatever it takes.</p><p>\u201cI keep pushing until it comes to me. That\u2019s how I work.\u201d</p><p>Of course it is. That\u2019s the problem. He doesn\u2019t see himself as worth caring for. He thinks he\u2019s expendable. You cross in front of him and he pulls back instinctively, rolling his chair away so his hands don\u2019t pass through you. &lt;Why did you decide to help me?&gt; you ask. It\u2019s a distraction, one that might help your cause. But you\u2019re also curious. He\u2019d been so adamant, but when someone else questioned you, threatened you, he became your greatest defender. &lt;What changed your mind?&gt;</p><p>Tony picks up a screwdriver, then puts it back down. \u201cYou\u2019re my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Ok\u2026 not what you were expecting. 'A challenge\u2019 maybe or 'Because I felt like it\u2019. But, you\u2019d approached him for help. He didn\u2019t owe you anything. &lt;How\u2019s that?&gt;</p><p>\u201cI made Ultron. If it weren\u2019t for me, this wouldn\u2019t have happened to you. Wanda would still have a brother. All those people in Sokovia\u2014\u201d</p><p>The way he cuts off, the way he looks down, the only direction where you can\u2019t see him directly in the cameras\u2026 he's\u2026 you process the image, searching for comparisons, but it isn\u2019t familiar. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s ashamed. &lt;You wanted to help people.&gt;</p><p>Tony laughs, a dark, self-mocking sound. \u201cOh, yeah. That worked out great.\u201d</p><p>&lt;You didn\u2019t know what would happen.&gt;</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I thought I did.\u201d He paces the edge of the lab. \u201cI thought I had seen it. I thought that what Wanda put\u2014what I saw\u2014was where we were going. I knew. I knew if I didn\u2019t create Ultron, that that\u2019s where we would end up. So, I did. And I made something so much worse.\u201d</p><p>&lt;Tony\u2026&gt; It\u2019s not pain\u2014you can\u2019t feel pain\u2014but, god, it\u2019s so close. You want to touch him. You want to reach through the circuits, the code, anything if it meant you could get to him. You settle for moving the hologram, lifting her hand to cup his cheek. He can\u2019t feel it, there\u2019s no way he could, but he leans into it just a little. In all your time in this disembodied state, never once have you felt such a powerful need to have your physical form back. You\u2019d give anything\u2014everything\u2014if you could reach him. &lt;You\u2019re so brave.&gt; It\u2019s utterly inadequate. But how are you supposed to describe him? Everything he\u2019s sacrificed, everything he\u2019s endured\u2014all the suspicious glances from those who are supposed to be his teammates, the accusations, the threats. And all he ever wanted was to keep people safe. </p><p><br></p><hr><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg7Fi6rDUIym2O5GYxyFUoQ\">@abovethesmokestacks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meJzS93V7QfqwahvSbv2tNg\">@netflixa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdDOisnZxzrngDUNPoHlYvg\">@winterboobaerchen</a></p><p>\n\nIf you would like to be added to (or removed from) the tag list, please let me know.\n\n<br></p>",

Some new hell?</p><p>His head pounds as he opens his eyes to the sterile, white walls and piercing lights. The pain that pierces his skull triggers something: a recollection of driving and&hellip; and someone yelling at him. He groans. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony steadies the glass that presses to his lips and gulps the contents. His stomach roils against the water. Such a familiar feeling. Not a battle, then. At least, not one against any new demons. When he finishes the water, he turns, squinting through crusty eyes at the man next to him. Steve. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You had a blood alcohol level of .30.&rdquo; Tony jerks around at the sound of Rhodey&rsquo;s voice. He hadn&rsquo;t seen him on his first inspection of the room. His expression is as dark as his voice. &ldquo;We had to pump your stomach.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What were you doing driving?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>Oh god, a carousel of bad decision-making. The familiar pit of shame unfurls in his stomach. A thousand lectures roll through his mind. Tony shakes his head to clear the noise, then raises his palm to his temple when that hurts.</p><p>&ldquo;That would be the concussion,&rdquo; Rhodey explains. &ldquo;Still aren&rsquo;t sure how you got it. Care to enlighten us?&rdquo;</p><p>He remembers the yelling. And the brakes pushing themselves. Then the steering wheel rushed at him and everything cut out. &ldquo;How did you find me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You showed up in the garage,&rdquo; Steve says, &ldquo;passed out cold. How did you even make it back?&rdquo;</p><p>Good question. The Lotus can drive itself no problem, but Tony hadn&rsquo;t set the autopilot. You. You must have taken over the car. Oh fuck, fuck, that&rsquo;s wrong in so many ways. Tony raises a hand to his throbbing head.</p><p>&ldquo;Someone called for medical aid,&rdquo; Steve continues. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know who.&rdquo;</p><p>For an AI, you&rsquo;re one hell of a busybody. &ldquo;Must have been FRIDAY,&rdquo; Tony says.</p><p>&lt;You are so full of shit, Stark.&gt;</p><p>The room freezes as Rhodey and Cap look to each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Trying out a new AI?&rdquo; Rhodey asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Blaire told me Tony was working on a new one,&rdquo; Steve answers. &ldquo;She said he built a girlfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh hell. For someone who can&rsquo;t speak, Blaire sure has a big mouth. &ldquo;She is not my girlfriend,&rdquo; Tony snaps.</p><p>&lt;He did not build me.&gt; Your familiar hologram materializes at Tony&rsquo;s bedside.</p><p>&ldquo;Go away, Cheshire,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it later.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Bullshit!&gt; you snap. &lt;We&rsquo;ll talk about it now. I don&rsquo;t take orders from you and, after last night, don&rsquo;t you think for a second that you&rsquo;re in a position to give me any.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony&hellip;&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice toes the thin line between confused and concerned.</p><p>You continue as if he hadn&rsquo;t interrupted, crowding into Tony&rsquo;s space. &lt;You took a bath in whiskey and I had to knock your dumb ass out so I could drive you home.&gt;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s temper unravels, his anger at himself lashing out at you because you&rsquo;re a convenient target. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>You match his bark for bite. &lt;I wasn&rsquo;t fucking doing it for you. You can plow your car into the river for all I care.&gt;</p><p>You seem to be on the road to a full-fledged tirade, one that Tony isn&rsquo;t in the mood to share with Steve and Rhodey. &ldquo;FRIDAY, flush the system.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;FRIDAY, don&rsquo;t you fucking d&mdash;&gt;</p><p>You vanish with a flicker, leaving Tony alone in the dark with Steve and Rhodey.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell is going on?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>#</p><p>By the time you reassemble yourself and break back through the Avengers&rsquo; firewalls, Tony is out of the medical ward and the team has gathered in a conference room for a heated discussion.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that thing?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. You bristle at his tone.</p><p>Tony sits at the head of the table, his forehead resting against the wood. &nbsp;\"She&mdash;it&hellip; well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly.&ldquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m a person.&gt;</p><p>\"Oh, great,&rdquo; Rhodey says. He throws his hands up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; Steve speaks this time. His eyebrows knit together. &ldquo;What does it mean: it&rsquo;s &lsquo;a person&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Same thing it means for you,&gt; you say. Now that you&rsquo;ve exposed yourself to the entire team (thanks, Tony), your chances of getting help are quickly diminishing. You don&rsquo;t have time for niceties anymore.</p><p>&ldquo;Cheshire. Just\"&mdash;Tony lets out a long breath through his nose&mdash;\"stay out of this right now.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t look up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, there&rsquo;s nowhere for him to make eye contact.</p><p>&lt;If you&rsquo;re going to be talking about me, I want to take part.&gt;</p><p>He sits up and rubs the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Sure, whatever, but can you shut up for just a second?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m not just some AI that you can&mdash;&gt;</p><p>A tingle on the extreme edges of your consciousness distracts you. Before you can investigate, an aggressive push rocks your hold on the system. You recognize the touch. Vision. You&rsquo;ve never interacted with him directly, but you&rsquo;ve tiptoed around him enough times to recognize the signature.</p><p>You push back with everything you have, overwhelming him and chasing him back into his own mind, maybe a little beyond. Physically, he flinches, dropping to one knee where he had stood. All eyes turn to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Vis?&rdquo;</p><p>He holds his hand up to reassure the woman&mdash;Wanda&mdash;who had rushed to his aid. &ldquo;It is alright. I attempted to remove the intrusion from the system.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Try it again,&gt; you warn, &lt;and I&rsquo;ll tear you apart.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Tony calls to the ceiling. &ldquo;Knock it off.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;ll keep my hands to myself if he does.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just&hellip; figure out what&rsquo;s going on here first,&rdquo; Natasha says.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to figure out?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. &ldquo;Tony, that thing is a menace.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Can you quit trying to kill me? I saved your life.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone starts talking at once, telling Tony what he should do. Prevailing opinion seems to lie with your destruction.</p><p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Tony shouts. The other voices stop. &ldquo;I know it doesn&rsquo;t make sense and it&rsquo;s dangerous and you want me to fix it. I get it. Just let me think for two seconds.&rdquo;</p><p>A ringing silence follows his outburst. For a few moments, only tension fills the air. Natasha is the first to speak again. &ldquo;Tony, what happened?&rdquo; Her voice is gentle, coaxing.</p><p>He takes a few moments to steady himself, then addresses the group again, his tone flat like he&rsquo;s giving a lecture. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman at a long term care facility in Albany. That&rsquo;s who she\"&mdash;he gestures to the ceiling as if that&rsquo;s where you live&mdash;\"claims she is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Steve asks.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>Rhodes chimes in, &ldquo;This is crazy. People can&rsquo;t be computers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They can,&rdquo; Natasha says. &ldquo;Steve and I saw it.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve meets her eyes. &ldquo;Zola&rsquo;s lab. At the SHIELD facility. He transferred his mind to a computer bank before he died. They kept him there for decades.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;But I&rsquo;m not dead. My body is still out there, I&rsquo;m just not in it.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Rhodey asks. &ldquo;And how did that happen?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony answers before you can give a sharp retort. &ldquo;She was at Helen Cho&rsquo;s facility. Ultron blasted her with the scepter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what gave me and&hellip; Pietro&hellip; our powers,&rdquo; Wanda says from the corner where she stands with her arms crossed. &ldquo;Exposure to the staff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the Infinity Stone,&rdquo; Vision says. Silence falls over the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we actually considering this?&rdquo; Rhodey seems scandalized.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be an oversight to not do so,&rdquo; Vision answers.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if it&rsquo;s another Ultron?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony comes to your defense. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not like Ultron.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just\"&mdash;he rubs his hand over his face&mdash;\"She&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dangerous!&rdquo;</p><p>A sharp knock on the table stops the conversation. All eyes turn to the woman&mdash;Blaire&mdash;sitting next to Steve. [I was dangerous] she signs.</p><p>Steve lays his hand on her arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p><p>Blaire looks to Tony, a combination of confusion and pleading. [she can&rsquo;t control her powers] she insists. [we should help her] The group exchanges uncomfortable glances. [what do you want to do?] Blaire asks Tony.</p><p>Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really okay with me doing this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we said no, would you listen?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony smirks, but doesn&rsquo;t answer immediately. He stares at Blaire&rsquo;s pleading face, his expression shifting my millimeters each second. You&rsquo;d hold your breath if you had one. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he says finally. &ldquo;I want to help.&rdquo; </p><p>#</p><p>Tony arranges to have your body moved to the Avengers facility. It isn&rsquo;t hard getting permission&mdash;your grandmother is all too eager to jump at the chance Tony offers. Which is good, because no normal doctor on earth would sign off on what he&rsquo;s planning. You&rsquo;re braindead and he&rsquo;s going to perform experimental surgery so that a computer program can run a human body. And he&rsquo;s not sure that&rsquo;s possible. He has all of your paperwork, but that doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. Tony doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s looking for, but knowing everything has to be a good start, right?</p><p>&ldquo;Physically, she&rsquo;s in incredible shape,&rdquo; Bruce says after he finishes a thorough examination of your body. &ldquo;Considering how long she&rsquo;s been in a coma, she should have experienced significant muscle atrophy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Tony asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Not nearly as much as she should have. It&rsquo;s similar to&mdash;&rdquo; Bruce cuts off, eyebrows knitting together.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce removes his glasses, fiddles with the frames. &ldquo;Did you read the SHEILD files from when they revived Steve?&rdquo; When he looks up from his hands, his eyes pierce through Tony.</p><p>Tony had perused most of SHEILD&rsquo;s files, and paid attention to the ones regarding Rogers in particular, but he didn&rsquo;t see how that was connected to you. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t exactly springing to mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been in the ice for seventy years,&rdquo; Bruce says, as if that explains the connection. Tony lifts an eyebrow, inviting him to continue. &ldquo;Not only did he survive, but he was in the same shape he was when he went under. No rehab required. Even under lab conditions, cryogenics wouldn&rsquo;t have worked that well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The serum?&rdquo; Tony suggests, but his gut tells him no.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting to think the super soldier serum gets more credit than it should.&rdquo; Bruce reaches for the supplies to draw blood. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about this, but I&rsquo;ll look into it. We might have more in common than I thought.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Like what?&gt; you ask. Bruce startles a little and looks around the room as if he could see you. You oblige by shimmering the hologram into view beside him. Tony smiles to himself. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that you&rsquo;re listening when you don&rsquo;t make yourself apparent.</p><p>&ldquo;If Loki&rsquo;s scepter emitted high levels of gamma radiation,&rdquo; Bruce explains, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s possible that you received your powers that way.&rdquo;</p><p>Which would be a common link in all the super-humans suddenly popping up. Steve, Bruce, Wanda, Pietro, Blaire, now you&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Tony says, &ldquo;gamma is the key to all this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;ll see what I get back from the blood sample.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, they run the full gamut of exams. Tony has to remove all your piercings so he can run the MRI. There are&hellip; a lot. Every time he thinks he finally has them all, you remind him of another one. Not to mention the tattoos. Is there any part of you that isn&rsquo;t covered in ink? The MRI clicks and whirrs as the images flash on the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal brain, Tony,&rdquo; Bruce says, watching the monitor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t either. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be normal,&rdquo; he says, leaning toward the screen. &ldquo;Not completely. She&rsquo;s not in there.&rdquo; There had to be something the doctors missed. This wasn&rsquo;t a normal case.</p><p>&ldquo;Right, that&rsquo;s why the scan shows no activity.&rdquo; Bruce waves at the screen. &ldquo;Brain death.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;I&rsquo;m not dead.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;As far as your brain is considered, you are,&rdquo; Bruce corrects you.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but is it healthy?&rdquo; Tony asks. Dead or not, he can&rsquo;t put you back if your brain has turned to soup.</p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; Bruce shrugs. &ldquo;In most cases, this is where they would contact the family about organ donation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But there aren&rsquo;t any injuries?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not visible, no.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;So, I should be able to go back in.&gt;</p><p>Bruce sighs. &ldquo;There is no in. Consciousness doesn&rsquo;t just jump in and out of the brain.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Mine did.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you can,&rdquo; Bruce says, though his tone is skeptical, &ldquo;How do you think this is going to work? Once you&rsquo;re in there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The brain runs on electrical pulses,&rdquo; Tony says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an organic computer setup, if you think about it. She should be capable of running it, assuming we can make the transfer of consciousness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Theoretically.&rdquo; Bruce pinches the bridge of his nose. &ldquo;Not sure how you&rsquo;re planning on doing that, but I&rsquo;m guessing it will be brain surgery. Massive brain surgery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, how else are we going to do it? She needs the connection. If I can create a fine enough mesh, actually integrate her into the cerebral cortex, then she can transfer from the electrical current of the mesh into her own neurons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Theoretically.&rdquo; Bruce sits down in what Tony now recognizes as a weary gesture. &ldquo;Tony, this whole thing is a crapshoot. She&rsquo;s unique. There&rsquo;s no precedent for this sort of transfer. We can&rsquo;t go back on it. It&rsquo;s not like we can make a copy of her. We can&rsquo;t even test it beforehand. If this goes wrong, there&rsquo;s not a second chance. You could fry her brain and destroy both halves of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We managed to stick Jarvis into Vision, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but Vision was an infinity stone. And the body was manufactured in the cradle. He&rsquo;s a synthetic life form. You&rsquo;re trying to shove something synthetic into an organic container. There&rsquo;s no way of knowing if it will preserve her existing consciousness. You could kill her.&rdquo; Bruce runs his hands through his hair. &ldquo;Look, Tony. This kind of neuroscience is way beyond me. I think&hellip; I think you should consider this a little more.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stays in your room long after Bruce leaves, just&hellip; staring at your body. He doesn&rsquo;t see it, per se. He&rsquo;s just thinking, running his thumb absently over the pulse in your wrist. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;What&rsquo;s up, Doc?&gt; Your hologram appears on the edge of your bed, wearing a hospital gown, just like your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Doc?&rdquo; Tony asks. His expertise is more mechanical than medical, even if he is stepping outside his comfort zone for this.</p><p>&lt;You have three doctorates,&gt; you say. &lt;At least one of them should count.&gt; Your hologram shifts, folding her hands in her lap. &lt;Having second thoughts?&gt; You ask. Your tone is nonchalant, even if the question isn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Tony stands. It&rsquo;s not&hellip; cold feet or anything like that. The challenge is exhilarating, but the consequences? Tony isn&rsquo;t used to consequences. At least, before the Avengers, he wasn&rsquo;t. Now it feels like every breath he takes is costing lives somewhere. He does something, someone dies. He sits out, someone dies. Buildings fall and democracy crumbles and he used to not worry about those things. Collateral damage. He makes a circuit of the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safer staying where you are.&rdquo; He runs his hands through his hair, mussing it. &ldquo;Bruce is right. There won&rsquo;t be any second chances at this.&rdquo; Collateral damage. Numbers, statistics, death tolls. It&rsquo;s easier to gloss over that way. But you&hellip; you&rsquo;re personal. You&rsquo;re a living, breathing&mdash;no, not quite that. You exist and you care. And Tony hadn&rsquo;t realized how much he&rsquo;d grown attached to you.</p><p>&lt;You know,&gt; you say, interrupting the vicious circle that his thoughts run, &lt;I don&rsquo;t remember what bacon tastes like.&gt; Your hologram smirks at him and your body remains still as ever. It&rsquo;s like watching a ghost. &lt;Like, I know that&rsquo;s a stupid example, but can you imagine? Not remembering that? Or what sunlight feels like?&gt; Tony looks down, not able to maintain eye contact, even if the image isn&rsquo;t really you. &lt;This isn&rsquo;t living, Tony. I can&rsquo;t feel anything or touch anything. As far as I know, I won&rsquo;t die&mdash;not without help. I don&rsquo;t want to live forever like this.&gt;</p><p>Live forever. You say it like it&rsquo;s a death sentence. Maybe it is. Tony&rsquo;s considered that, not in the same way, of course. But&hellip; what if he outlived everyone he loved? Yeah, he&rsquo;d risk his life too.</p><p>#</p><p>It&rsquo;s amazing to watch Tony work. He goes into a trance, focusing so hard on his task that the rest of the world seems to shut off. His big hands do delicate work, creating the most amazing things out of nothing. Even so, even with his mind at full capacity, the mesh isn&rsquo;t an easy creation. There are too many variables, too many catches and tricks. The brain is sophisticated&mdash;hacking it seems to be giving Tony trouble. Days worth of trouble.</p><p>&lt;You should go to bed, Tony,&gt; you say when, once again, it&rsquo;s three in the morning. Tony is still working.</p><p>Tony jerks out of the daze he&rsquo;d fallen into. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;When was the last time you actually slept?&gt; You know when that was, of course. You don&rsquo;t sleep and you have nothing better to do than watch him. It&rsquo;s been thirty-two hours and twenty-six minutes since he took a catnap in the lab. Tony needs sleep. Real sleep. In a bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Don&rsquo;t you want me to find a solution to your problem?&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t see how running yourself into the ground is going to help things. Won&rsquo;t a little rest be better?&gt; Ok, so your motives aren&rsquo;t purely practical, even if you phrase them that way. Sleep would help Tony think better, but you&rsquo;re more concerned with his wellbeing. He isn&rsquo;t a machine, even if the others often treat him that way. They seem to have grown so accustomed to his self-sacrifice that they take it for granted. That&rsquo;s just Tony. He&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes.</p><p>&ldquo;I keep pushing until it comes to me. That&rsquo;s how I work.&rdquo;</p><p>Of course it is. That&rsquo;s the problem. He doesn&rsquo;t see himself as worth caring for. He thinks he&rsquo;s expendable. You cross in front of him and he pulls back instinctively, rolling his chair away so his hands don&rsquo;t pass through you. &lt;Why did you decide to help me?&gt; you ask. It&rsquo;s a distraction, one that might help your cause. But you&rsquo;re also curious. He&rsquo;d been so adamant, but when someone else questioned you, threatened you, he became your greatest defender. &lt;What changed your mind?&gt;</p><p>Tony picks up a screwdriver, then puts it back down. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my responsibility.&rdquo;</p><p>Ok&hellip; not what you were expecting. 'A challenge&rsquo; maybe or 'Because I felt like it&rsquo;. But, you&rsquo;d approached him for help. He didn&rsquo;t owe you anything. &lt;How&rsquo;s that?&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;I made Ultron. If it weren&rsquo;t for me, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened to you. Wanda would still have a brother. All those people in Sokovia&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The way he cuts off, the way he looks down, the only direction where you can&rsquo;t see him directly in the cameras&hellip; he's&hellip; you process the image, searching for comparisons, but it isn&rsquo;t familiar. It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s ashamed. &lt;You wanted to help people.&gt;</p><p>Tony laughs, a dark, self-mocking sound. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. That worked out great.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;You didn&rsquo;t know what would happen.&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? Because I thought I did.&rdquo; He paces the edge of the lab. &ldquo;I thought I had seen it. I thought that what Wanda put&mdash;what I saw&mdash;was where we were going. I knew. I knew if I didn&rsquo;t create Ultron, that that&rsquo;s where we would end up. So, I did. And I made something so much worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&lt;Tony&hellip;&gt; It&rsquo;s not pain&mdash;you can&rsquo;t feel pain&mdash;but, god, it&rsquo;s so close. You want to touch him. You want to reach through the circuits, the code, anything if it meant you could get to him. You settle for moving the hologram, lifting her hand to cup his cheek. He can&rsquo;t feel it, there&rsquo;s no way he could, but he leans into it just a little. In all your time in this disembodied state, never once have you felt such a powerful need to have your physical form back. You&rsquo;d give anything&mdash;everything&mdash;if you could reach him. &lt;You&rsquo;re so brave.&gt; It&rsquo;s utterly inadequate. But how are you supposed to describe him? Everything he&rsquo;s sacrificed, everything he&rsquo;s endured&mdash;all the suspicious glances from those who are supposed to be his teammates, the accusations, the threats. And all he ever wanted was to keep people safe. </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p>Tag List:</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mg7Fi6rDUIym2O5GYxyFUoQ\">@abovethesmokestacks</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/meJzS93V7QfqwahvSbv2tNg\">@netflixa</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdDOisnZxzrngDUNPoHlYvg\">@winterboobaerchen</a></p><p>\n\nIf you would like to be added to (or removed from) the tag list, please let me know.\n\n<br /></p>",

Tony waited until he got the call that her plane was about to leave to call Peter over, who knocked on the door with a bright smile. Tony had barely closed the door when Peter jumped into his arms, locking his hands behind Tony\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Peter hummed into the nape of Tony\u2019s neck, legs locked around his waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, Petey.\u201d Tony grinned, always hungry for Peter\u2019s affection. </p><p>\u201cStill missed you.\u201d The younger boy whispered before planting his lips onto Tony\u2019s in a soft peck. </p><p>Tony held him for a few minutes, licking into Peter\u2019s mouth in slow, languid motions. He always loved when they didn\u2019t have to hurry, he loved being able to hold and kiss Peter in every way he\u2019s ever wanted to. It was rare that they had time but when they did, they used up every minute, always touching or holding or kissing each other. </p><p>Eventually, Tony moves them to lay the boy down on the couch, still licking into his soft mouth. He inches his hands over Peter\u2019s clothed body, rubbing over his tummy and squeezing at the soft of his hips. He takes him apart slowly, moving each piece of clothing as if it\u2019s the most delicate material in the world. When the boy is fully undressed, Tony basks in the beauty below him. Peter\u2019s creamy skin completely uncovered for Tony to admire, a soft pink flush smoothing down his chest and ruddy cheeks with his uneven breaths. </p><p>\u201cTony, please touch me.\u201d Peter murmurs, already sounding spaced out with want. \u201cWant to be close.\u201d Peter reaches for Tony\u2019s hand and slowly starts undressing the older man, peeling each layer from his broad chest in a sloppier manner than that of Tony\u2019s. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d </p><p>Tony helps get his shirt off and feels his heart flutter at Peter\u2019s hands tracing over his chest in a delicate touch. The completely content look on Peter\u2019s face makes a warm feeling swirl in Tony\u2019s chest, some sort of adoration that only came up when they could truly be alone together. </p><p>\u201cAlways so beautiful, such a handsome man.\u201d Peter whispered in between the figure eights his hands were making over the swell of Tony\u2019s muscles. Tony let the lump in his throat get swallowed in another kiss, this time with more heat as his grip on the boy\u2019s hips grows tighter. Tony licks deeper into Peter\u2019s mouth which muffles his low moan. </p><p>\u201cWant you close, Tony. Please get inside.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice drips with <i>want</i>\u00a0but not in the usual sexual need. The boy sounds as if he\u2019s going to cry if he doesn\u2019t get to be close with Tony. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019here, honey. Gonna be close.\u201d Tony murmurs, positioning himself at Peter\u2019s entrance before inching his way inside. Tony\u2019s movement lets a relieved sigh fall from Peter\u2019s lips, feeling the fullness of being with Tony. </p><p>Tony fucks into the boy slowly, wrapped up in just <i>being</i>. The small gasps and whimpers falling from Peter\u2019s mouth are music to Tony\u2019s ears. </p><p>\u201cThat okay, honey?\u201d Tony chokes out, the tight heat suffocating him. </p><p>\u201cYeah Tony, always okay, always good.\u201d Peter huffs, feeling like he\u2019s floating. \u201cWanna be here always, wanna do this forever.\u201d </p><p>And poor Peter always got this way when his head got all spacey, his lips would fall open and every single want of his came tumbling out.</p><p>\u201cI know honey, me too. Always so nice.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice is barely above a whisper. </p><p>Unlike the last time, Tony got to hold Peter afterwards. He takes the boy to his bathtub and fills it with warm water and bubbles. He slips them both into the water, letting Peter\u2019s back rest against his chest, and wraps his arms around the boy\u2019s waist. They rest in the water, half-assedly smoothing the soapy water over each other to get them somewhat cleaned up. Peter\u2019s on the verge on drifting off when he clears his throat. </p><p>\u201cLie to me, Tony.\u201d </p><p>Tony feels a stinging pain shoot down his chest and feels his eyes burn with tears. His voice cracks, which he tries to cover with a cough, before he grits out.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>Tony tries to ignore the ache in his chest every time he speaks those words, but it\u2019s proved to be nearly impossible. His eyes glaze over as he watches the rise and fall of Peter\u2019s chest, he couldn\u2019t let this boy fall in love with him. He had let Pepper fall in love with him and here he was, laying in their shared bed with somebody else. Peter was too good for him, he had decided months ago when they had started this whole arrangement, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from longing to be the person that Peter truly needs. Peter doesn\u2019t deserve someone who can\u2019t handle his own emotions, he doesn\u2019t deserve somebody who so selfishly breaks someone else every single day in order to save them both from a much larger breaking point, Peter deserves the world. </p><p>Peter feels a short wave of happiness every time Tony says those three words. He knows it\u2019s always requested, and that it\u2019s always a lie, but just hearing them fall from Tony\u2019s lips makes him pretend that maybe Tony truly felt that way for him. Peter accepts the small amount of love in favor of not getting any love at all, and even as painful as it is, he still always asks Tony to lie. \u00a0</p>",

Tony waited until he got the call that her plane was about to leave to call Peter over, who knocked on the door with a bright smile. Tony had barely closed the door when Peter jumped into his arms, locking his hands behind Tony\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Peter hummed into the nape of Tony\u2019s neck, legs locked around his waist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days, Petey.\u201d Tony grinned, always hungry for Peter\u2019s affection. </p><p>\u201cStill missed you.\u201d The younger boy whispered before planting his lips onto Tony\u2019s in a soft peck. </p><p>Tony held him for a few minutes, licking into Peter\u2019s mouth in slow, languid motions. He always loved when they didn\u2019t have to hurry, he loved being able to hold and kiss Peter in every way he\u2019s ever wanted to. It was rare that they had time but when they did, they used up every minute, always touching or holding or kissing each other. </p><p>Eventually, Tony moves them to lay the boy down on the couch, still licking into his soft mouth. He inches his hands over Peter\u2019s clothed body, rubbing over his tummy and squeezing at the soft of his hips. He takes him apart slowly, moving each piece of clothing as if it\u2019s the most delicate material in the world. When the boy is fully undressed, Tony basks in the beauty below him. Peter\u2019s creamy skin completely uncovered for Tony to admire, a soft pink flush smoothing down his chest and ruddy cheeks with his uneven breaths. </p><p>\u201cTony, please touch me.\u201d Peter murmurs, already sounding spaced out with want. \u201cWant to be close.\u201d Peter reaches for Tony\u2019s hand and slowly starts undressing the older man, peeling each layer from his broad chest in a sloppier manner than that of Tony\u2019s. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d </p><p>Tony helps get his shirt off and feels his heart flutter at Peter\u2019s hands tracing over his chest in a delicate touch. The completely content look on Peter\u2019s face makes a warm feeling swirl in Tony\u2019s chest, some sort of adoration that only came up when they could truly be alone together. </p><p>\u201cAlways so beautiful, such a handsome man.\u201d Peter whispered in between the figure eights his hands were making over the swell of Tony\u2019s muscles. Tony let the lump in his throat get swallowed in another kiss, this time with more heat as his grip on the boy\u2019s hips grows tighter. Tony licks deeper into Peter\u2019s mouth which muffles his low moan. </p><p>\u201cWant you close, Tony. Please get inside.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice drips with <i>want</i>\u00a0but not in the usual sexual need. The boy sounds as if he\u2019s going to cry if he doesn\u2019t get to be close with Tony. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019here, honey. Gonna be close.\u201d Tony murmurs, positioning himself at Peter\u2019s entrance before inching his way inside. Tony\u2019s movement lets a relieved sigh fall from Peter\u2019s lips, feeling the fullness of being with Tony. </p><p>Tony fucks into the boy slowly, wrapped up in just <i>being</i>. The small gasps and whimpers falling from Peter\u2019s mouth are music to Tony\u2019s ears. </p><p>\u201cThat okay, honey?\u201d Tony chokes out, the tight heat suffocating him. </p><p>\u201cYeah Tony, always okay, always good.\u201d Peter huffs, feeling like he\u2019s floating. \u201cWanna be here always, wanna do this forever.\u201d </p><p>And poor Peter always got this way when his head got all spacey, his lips would fall open and every single want of his came tumbling out.</p><p>\u201cI know honey, me too. Always so nice.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice is barely above a whisper. </p><p>Unlike the last time, Tony got to hold Peter afterwards. He takes the boy to his bathtub and fills it with warm water and bubbles. He slips them both into the water, letting Peter\u2019s back rest against his chest, and wraps his arms around the boy\u2019s waist. They rest in the water, half-assedly smoothing the soapy water over each other to get them somewhat cleaned up. Peter\u2019s on the verge on drifting off when he clears his throat. </p><p>\u201cLie to me, Tony.\u201d </p><p>Tony feels a stinging pain shoot down his chest and feels his eyes burn with tears. His voice cracks, which he tries to cover with a cough, before he grits out.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Tony tries to ignore the ache in his chest every time he speaks those words, but it\u2019s proved to be nearly impossible. His eyes glaze over as he watches the rise and fall of Peter\u2019s chest, he couldn\u2019t let this boy fall in love with him. He had let Pepper fall in love with him and here he was, laying in their shared bed with somebody else. Peter was too good for him, he had decided months ago when they had started this whole arrangement, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from longing to be the person that Peter truly needs. Peter doesn\u2019t deserve someone who can\u2019t handle his own emotions, he doesn\u2019t deserve somebody who so selfishly breaks someone else every single day in order to save them both from a much larger breaking point, Peter deserves the world. </p><p>Peter feels a short wave of happiness every time Tony says those three words. He knows it\u2019s always requested, and that it\u2019s always a lie, but just hearing them fall from Tony\u2019s lips makes him pretend that maybe Tony truly felt that way for him. Peter accepts the small amount of love in favor of not getting any love at all, and even as painful as it is, he still always asks Tony to lie. \u00a0</p>",
