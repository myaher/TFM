Harry&rsquo;s brow furrows at the loss of contact, but he watches Peter expectantly. </p><p>\t&ldquo;We need to talk,&rdquo; Peter says. &ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s not bad I promise, I&rsquo;m not breaking up with you. Well, it&rsquo;s not bad unless you react badly and then-&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Peter.&rdquo; Harry says calmly, interrupting his ramble. Harry takes his hands and gives him a suppurative smile. &ldquo;Take a breath.&rdquo; Harry mimes taking a deep breath and Peter copies him. &ldquo;Now, what do we need to talk about.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPeter squeezes Harry&rsquo;s hands and takes another deep breath, &ldquo;Um, okay, I don&rsquo;t know how to begin so I&rsquo;ll just say it,&rdquo; Peter can feel his anxiety pressing against his chest, but he tries to ignore it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asexual.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes snap up to gage Harry&rsquo;s reaction. Harry is silent for a moment. Peter&rsquo;s hands twitch with anxiety, waiting for his reaction. </p><p>\tThen Harry pulls him into a tight hug. Peter sighs in relief and hugs Harry back. They sit like that for a few minutes before Harry presses a kiss to Peter&rsquo;s cheek and pulls back. Harry rests his hand on Peter&rsquo;s cheek, he leans into the touch. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Thank you for telling me, Peter,&rdquo; Harry says, looking into his eyes. </p><p>\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not upset?&rdquo; Peter asks his eyes large with anticipation. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Harry says, leaning towards Peter. &ldquo;Why would I be?&rdquo;</p><p>\tPeter shrugs, &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m different. Because you didn&rsquo;t know that when we started dating.&rdquo;</p><p>\tHarry just shakes his head, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not different, you&rsquo;re still the same to me. Who cares if I didn&rsquo;t know that when we started dating. I know that now and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s eyes brim with tears as he takes in the words from his sweet, caring boyfriend. Harry tightens his hold Peter&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;I want you to know that this won&rsquo;t change anything about our relationship and that I still look at you the same, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>\tPeter tackles Harry with a hug, Harry catches him with a laugh, &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Peter says. </p><p>\t&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Harry says, pulling back. Peter&rsquo;s eyes grow wide as he realizes that he said that out loud. Then he realizes that was the first time he told Harry that he loved him. &ldquo;Peter&hellip;&rdquo; Harry whispers, his voice full of emotion, &ldquo;I love you, too.&rdquo; Peter face breaks open with a smile. Harry leans forward and kisses Peter before hugging him again. </p><p>&hellip;</p><p>\tAfter Harry leaves, Steve and Tony meet Peter in the kitchen for dinner. Steve begins to boil water while Tony joins Peter sitting on the kitchen counter. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you, kid,&rdquo; Tony says ruffling Peter&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;That took guts.&rdquo;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Thanks, dad,&rdquo; Peter says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming you were listening to the whole conversation?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Tony responds with a smirk. </p><p>\t&ldquo;Steve too?&rdquo; </p><p>\t&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Tony says again.</p><p>\tPeter sighs, &ldquo;And?&rdquo; </p><p>\tTony smiles at Peter, &ldquo;He has our approval. He&rsquo;s good for you, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>\tPeter smiles, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>",

But she knew that\u2019s he has stayed so far, that\u2019s all that mattered. </p><p>Tony walked out of the room, walking down the hall and into the waiting room where everyone was, \u201cShe wants to see you, Spidey.\u201d </p><p>Earning \u2018ooooo\u2019s from everyone in the room, \u201csomeone\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Nat said as she took a sip of her coffee. </p><!-- more --><p>Peter sighed as he got up from his chair, \u201cdid you tell her what happened?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve slipped out,\u201d Tony said with a smirk.

Or thrown into jail!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spider-man, I doubt that would happen.\u201d </p><p>There was a knock at the door and then Nat peeked her head in, \u201cwhoa, we interrupting something?\u201d She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Olivia and Peter holding hands. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve then peaked his head in and saw them holding hands, \u201cwhoa, when did this happen?\u201d </p><p>Peter let go of Olivia\u2019s hand, \u201cI should probably go get her something to eat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCheeseburgers please,\u201d Olivia said softly. </p><p>Peter smiled, \u201cof course,\u201d he then walked out of the room. </p><p>Nat sighed as she walked over to Olivia, placing a hand on her cheek, \u201cyou scared us, Liv.\u201d </p><p>Steve stood on the other side of the bed, \u201cyou could\u2019ve gone to me or Nat, Liv.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI went to a lot of people,\u201d Olivia began to say, \u201cI was so deep in this hole\u2026 I didn\u2019t see a way out. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, Liv, there\u2019s always a way out that doesn\u2019t include this,\u201d Nat said as she pulled the girl into an embrace.</p><p>Olivia let out a small sob, \u201cI felt so empty, Nat,\u201d She exclaimed, \u201cI went to Jasmine and then she listened to the rumors at school! She said I probably wanted it!\u201d </p><p>Nat gently brushed Olivia&rsquo;s hair, in order to calm the young girl down, \u201cshhh,\u201d Nat gently said as she placed a kiss on the girl&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>\u201cRumors?\u201d Steve questioned.</p><p>Olivia gave him a nod as her sobs decreased, \u201cBren started telling everyone at school that I wanted to have sex with him.\u201d </p><p>Steve began to think that Peter did the right thing to beat the kid up, \u201chave you told your dad this?\u201d Olivia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLiv, we need you to tell your father everything that happened, we need you to trust us,\u201d Nat said softly. </p><p>Olivia sighed, \u201cI know, I just\u2026 it\u2019s gonna break him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut he has to know, sweetie,\u201d Nat wiped away a tear from the girl&rsquo;s cheek. Nat quickly placed a finger to her ear, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said silently as she looked at Steve who just gave her a small nod, \u201cwe\u2019ve been called for a quick mission, but we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll be out by then,\u201d Steve added with a small smile. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Olivia said. </p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Nat said to Steve. Nat gave Olivia a quick hug and kiss on the cheek before walking away. \u00a0</p><p>Steve gave the girl a reassuring smile, Olivia held onto his hand, \u201ccan you tell Bucky that I want to see him?\u201d </p><p>Steve gave her a small nod, \u201cof course.\u201d He kissed her on the top of her head before walking out of the room. </p><p>Bucky sat not too far from the room, watching as Nat and Steve walked out. He sighed to himself, he should\u2019ve gone home with Sam, he thought. Steve strolled over to Bucky, \u201cShe wants to see you,\u201d he whispered. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, \u201cI-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bound to see her sooner or later, pal. Might as well make it sooner. Get it over with,\u201d Steve said as he placed a reassuring hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Bucky knew that Steve was right, he looked over at the door, letting out a heavy sigh before getting up. He made his way over to the room, slowly opening the door, he walked in. Tears instantly welling up in his eyes, thoughts coming back from yesterday, he was holding her in his arms trying to save her life. </p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Olivia said softly, noticing his reaction. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything he quickly walked over to the young girl and enveloping her into a hug, \u201cNever do that again, doll,\u201d he said softly. He had already lost his younger sister and he couldn\u2019t lose another. </p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><h2><i><b>Taglist for Side Effects May Include is closed!

What if my dad didn\u2019t show up? What then?\u201d </p><p>\u201cBren would be dead,\u201d Peter mumbled. </p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes, \u201cor you could\u2019ve gotten hurt! Or thrown into jail!\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m spider-man, I doubt that would happen.\u201d </p><p>There was a knock at the door and then Nat peeked her head in, \u201cwhoa, we interrupting something?\u201d She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Olivia and Peter holding hands. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve then peaked his head in and saw them holding hands, \u201cwhoa, when did this happen?\u201d </p><p>Peter let go of Olivia\u2019s hand, \u201cI should probably go get her something to eat.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCheeseburgers please,\u201d Olivia said softly. </p><p>Peter smiled, \u201cof course,\u201d he then walked out of the room. </p><p>Nat sighed as she walked over to Olivia, placing a hand on her cheek, \u201cyou scared us, Liv.\u201d </p><p>Steve stood on the other side of the bed, \u201cyou could\u2019ve gone to me or Nat, Liv.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI went to a lot of people,\u201d Olivia began to say, \u201cI was so deep in this hole\u2026 I didn\u2019t see a way out. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, Liv, there\u2019s always a way out that doesn\u2019t include this,\u201d Nat said as she pulled the girl into an embrace.</p><p>Olivia let out a small sob, \u201cI felt so empty, Nat,\u201d She exclaimed, \u201cI went to Jasmine and then she listened to the rumors at school! She said I probably wanted it!\u201d </p><p>Nat gently brushed Olivia\u2019s hair, in order to calm the young girl down, \u201cshhh,\u201d Nat gently said as she placed a kiss on the girl\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cRumors?\u201d Steve questioned.</p><p>Olivia gave him a nod as her sobs decreased, \u201cBren started telling everyone at school that I wanted to have sex with him.\u201d </p><p>Steve began to think that Peter did the right thing to beat the kid up, \u201chave you told your dad this?\u201d Olivia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLiv, we need you to tell your father everything that happened, we need you to trust us,\u201d Nat said softly. </p><p>Olivia sighed, \u201cI know, I just\u2026 it\u2019s gonna break him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut he has to know, sweetie,\u201d Nat wiped away a tear from the girl\u2019s cheek. Nat quickly placed a finger to her ear, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said silently as she looked at Steve who just gave her a small nod, \u201cwe\u2019ve been called for a quick mission, but we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll be out by then,\u201d Steve added with a small smile. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Olivia said. </p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Nat said to Steve. Nat gave Olivia a quick hug and kiss on the cheek before walking away. \u00a0</p><p>Steve gave the girl a reassuring smile, Olivia held onto his hand, \u201ccan you tell Bucky that I want to see him?\u201d </p><p>Steve gave her a small nod, \u201cof course.\u201d He kissed her on the top of her head before walking out of the room. </p><p>Bucky sat not too far from the room, watching as Nat and Steve walked out. He sighed to himself, he should\u2019ve gone home with Sam, he thought. Steve strolled over to Bucky, \u201cShe wants to see you,\u201d he whispered. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, \u201cI-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bound to see her sooner or later, pal. Might as well make it sooner. Get it over with,\u201d Steve said as he placed a reassuring hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Bucky knew that Steve was right, he looked over at the door, letting out a heavy sigh before getting up. He made his way over to the room, slowly opening the door, he walked in. Tears instantly welling up in his eyes, thoughts coming back from yesterday, he was holding her in his arms trying to save her life. </p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Olivia said softly, noticing his reaction. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything he quickly walked over to the young girl and enveloping her into a hug, \u201cNever do that again, doll,\u201d he said softly. He had already lost his younger sister and he couldn\u2019t lose another. </p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><h2><i><b>Taglist for Side Effects May Include is closed!

She said I probably wanted it!\u201d </p><p>Nat gently brushed Olivia\u2019s hair, in order to calm the young girl down, \u201cshhh,\u201d Nat gently said as she placed a kiss on the girl\u2019s hair. </p><p>\u201cRumors?\u201d Steve questioned.</p><p>Olivia gave him a nod as her sobs decreased, \u201cBren started telling everyone at school that I wanted to have sex with him.\u201d </p><p>Steve began to think that Peter did the right thing to beat the kid up, \u201chave you told your dad this?\u201d Olivia shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLiv, we need you to tell your father everything that happened, we need you to trust us,\u201d Nat said softly. </p><p>Olivia sighed, \u201cI know, I just\u2026 it\u2019s gonna break him.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBut he has to know, sweetie,\u201d Nat wiped away a tear from the girl\u2019s cheek. Nat quickly placed a finger to her ear, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said silently as she looked at Steve who just gave her a small nod, \u201cwe\u2019ve been called for a quick mission, but we\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully you\u2019ll be out by then,\u201d Steve added with a small smile. </p><p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Olivia said. </p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d Nat said to Steve.

Steve strolled over to Bucky, \u201cShe wants to see you,\u201d he whispered. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, \u201cI-\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bound to see her sooner or later, pal. Might as well make it sooner. Get it over with,\u201d Steve said as he placed a reassuring hand on Bucky\u2019s shoulder. </p><p>Bucky knew that Steve was right, he looked over at the door, letting out a heavy sigh before getting up. He made his way over to the room, slowly opening the door, he walked in. Tears instantly welling up in his eyes, thoughts coming back from yesterday, he was holding her in his arms trying to save her life. </p><p>\u201cBucky,\u201d Olivia said softly, noticing his reaction. </p><p>Bucky didn\u2019t say anything he quickly walked over to the young girl and enveloping her into a hug, \u201cNever do that again, doll,\u201d he said softly. He had already lost his younger sister and he couldn\u2019t lose another. </p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><p><i><b><br></b></i></p><h2><i><b>Taglist for Side Effects May Include is closed!

But she knew that&rsquo;s he has stayed so far, that&rsquo;s all that mattered. </p><p>Tony walked out of the room, walking down the hall and into the waiting room where everyone was, &ldquo;She wants to see you, Spidey.&rdquo; </p><p>Earning &lsquo;ooooo&rsquo;s from everyone in the room, &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s in trouble,&rdquo; Nat said as she took a sip of her coffee. </p><p>Peter sighed as he got up from his chair, &ldquo;did you tell her what happened?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It might&rsquo;ve slipped out,&rdquo; Tony said with a smirk. Peter groaned to himself as he walked out of the waiting room with Tony. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Olivia for christ&rsquo;s sake, have you ever been scolded by her?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;&hellip; You&rsquo;re right, you have a lot to worry about,&rdquo; Tony patted Peter&rsquo;s back and then opened the door, Olivia gave her dad the look. The look that meant to leave them alone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in the waiting room,&rdquo; Tony smiled at them both before closing door. </p><p>&ldquo;Really Peter?!&rdquo; Olivia threw a pillow at him, &ldquo;beating up Bren!?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter sighed and picked up the pillow, fluffing it a bit as he walked over to Olivia, he placed the pillow back onto Olivia&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;he deserved it,&rdquo; he mumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve made things worse,&rdquo; she whispered. </p><p>&ldquo;So? I don&rsquo;t regret it if anything it&rsquo;s on me,&rdquo; Peter said softly. </p><p>Olivia glanced at his hands, noticing the small bruises and scraps forming on his knuckles, she gently grabbed them, &ldquo;you could&rsquo;ve gotten hurt.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m spider-man, I&rsquo;ve dealt with worse,&rdquo; Olivia let out a soft chuckle. Peter couldn&rsquo;t stop staring at her as she examined his hands, he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how beautiful she was, how he could&rsquo;ve lost her, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; </p><p>Olivia sighed, she gently put Peter&rsquo;s hand down, &ldquo;I told Jasmine,&rdquo; she chuckled, &ldquo;and then she said that I probably wanted it, because of rumors that were circulating in school&hellip; She decided to listen to rumors rather than her friend&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Peter grabbed Olivia&rsquo;s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not Jasmine.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But how was I supposed to know, Peter? How was I supposed to know that you wouldn&rsquo;t do the same?&rdquo; Olivia felt tears well up in her eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;Because I love you,&rdquo; Peter blurted. </p><p>Olivia quickly turned to look at Peter, &ldquo;you love me?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But you said it!&rdquo; She looks towards their hands, she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel how it felt so right, &ldquo;what about Jasmine?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter sighed, &ldquo;I was just playing along because I was afraid of your feelings towards me.&rdquo; </p><p>Olivia chuckled, &ldquo;funny, I had this huge crush on you when I first met you and I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I still didn&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter perked up, &ldquo;are you saying&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that my feelings towards you might be the same.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Might?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to indicate that if we do anything about this,&rdquo; she picked up their hands that were not intertwined, &ldquo;I want to take it slow, especially with everything going on.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter gave her an understanding nod, &ldquo;I can do slow.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not angry at you anymore for beating up Bren!&rdquo; Olivia said sternly. </p><p>Peter smiles, &ldquo;admit it, you think he deserved it.&rdquo;</p><p>Olivia sighed, &ldquo;yeah, he did but it was kind of reckless, Peter. What if my dad didn&rsquo;t show up? What then?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bren would be dead,&rdquo; Peter mumbled. </p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes, &ldquo;or you could&rsquo;ve gotten hurt! Or thrown into jail!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m spider-man, I doubt that would happen.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a knock at the door and then Nat peeked her head in, &ldquo;whoa, we interrupting something?&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Olivia and Peter holding hands. </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Steve then peaked his head in and saw them holding hands, &ldquo;whoa, when did this happen?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter let go of Olivia&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I should probably go get her something to eat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Cheeseburgers please,&rdquo; Olivia said softly. </p><p>Peter smiled, &ldquo;of course,&rdquo; he then walked out of the room. </p><p>Nat sighed as she walked over to Olivia, placing a hand on her cheek, &ldquo;you scared us, Liv.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve stood on the other side of the bed, &ldquo;you could&rsquo;ve gone to me or Nat, Liv.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I went to a lot of people,&rdquo; Olivia began to say, &ldquo;I was so deep in this hole&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t see a way out. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Liv, there&rsquo;s always a way out that doesn&rsquo;t include this,&rdquo; Nat said as she pulled the girl into an embrace.</p><p>Olivia let out a small sob, &ldquo;I felt so empty, Nat,&rdquo; She exclaimed, &ldquo;I went to Jasmine and then she listened to the rumors at school! She said I probably wanted it!&rdquo; </p><p>Nat gently brushed Olivia&rsquo;s hair, in order to calm the young girl down, &ldquo;shhh,&rdquo; Nat gently said as she placed a kiss on the girl&rsquo;s hair. </p><p>&ldquo;Rumors?&rdquo; Steve questioned.</p><p>Olivia gave him a nod as her sobs decreased, &ldquo;Bren started telling everyone at school that I wanted to have sex with him.&rdquo; </p><p>Steve began to think that Peter did the right thing to beat the kid up, &ldquo;have you told your dad this?&rdquo; Olivia shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Liv, we need you to tell your father everything that happened, we need you to trust us,&rdquo; Nat said softly. </p><p>Olivia sighed, &ldquo;I know, I just&hellip; it&rsquo;s gonna break him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But he has to know, sweetie,&rdquo; Nat wiped away a tear from the girl&rsquo;s cheek. Nat quickly placed a finger to her ear, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; she said silently as she looked at Steve who just gave her a small nod, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been called for a quick mission, but we&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully you&rsquo;ll be out by then,&rdquo; Steve added with a small smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully,&rdquo; Olivia said. </p><p>&ldquo;We should get going,&rdquo; Nat said to Steve. Nat gave Olivia a quick hug and kiss on the cheek before walking away. &nbsp;</p><p>Steve gave the girl a reassuring smile, Olivia held onto his hand, &ldquo;can you tell Bucky that I want to see him?&rdquo; </p><p>Steve gave her a small nod, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo; He kissed her on the top of her head before walking out of the room. </p><p>Bucky sat not too far from the room, watching as Nat and Steve walked out. He sighed to himself, he should&rsquo;ve gone home with Sam, he thought. Steve strolled over to Bucky, &ldquo;She wants to see you,&rdquo; he whispered. </p><p>Bucky shook his head, &ldquo;I-&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bound to see her sooner or later, pal. Might as well make it sooner. Get it over with,&rdquo; Steve said as he placed a reassuring hand on Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder. </p><p>Bucky knew that Steve was right, he looked over at the door, letting out a heavy sigh before getting up. He made his way over to the room, slowly opening the door, he walked in. Tears instantly welling up in his eyes, thoughts coming back from yesterday, he was holding her in his arms trying to save her life. </p><p>&ldquo;Bucky,&rdquo; Olivia said softly, noticing his reaction. </p><p>Bucky didn&rsquo;t say anything he quickly walked over to the young girl and enveloping her into a hug, &ldquo;Never do that again, doll,&rdquo; he said softly. He had already lost his younger sister and he couldn&rsquo;t lose another. </p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><p><i><b><br /></b></i></p><h2><i><b>Taglist for Side Effects May Include is closed!

Like he didn\u2019t carry the weight of any responsibility. </p><p>He opened his eyes. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t blinding, but everything was bright, not harshly bright, but calm. He sat up, aware of his surroundings, but not overwhelmed. He was on a grassy bank in front of the most calm and perfectly coloured lake he could never have pictured before seeing it. In the distance, mountains rose above the water, mountains so grand and green that he thought perhaps he was only making things up, but he couldn\u2019t have made up a view like that. The water and mountains and grass stretched as far as the eye could see, and he saw no one else, but he felt completely safe. </p><p>He stood up and walked down to the lake, hesitantly, he reached out a hand to touch the water lightly with his finger tips, feeling the perfect temperature. A hundred tiny, silver trigger fish swam past his hands, brushing them lightly. He sat down, putting his feet in the water, realising for the first time his face and body were clean. He was in only a white shirt and blue jeans, perhaps the most simple outfit he had been caught in since he had lived in the peak of childhood innocence. </p><p>Staring around, he had never felt more peaceful. He could feel the memories of what had happened in his head, but they didn\u2019t weigh him down. He knew he wasn\u2019t alive, wherever he was, but he was content in feeling this way so he didn\u2019t feel an intense desire to find out. </p><p>His feet in the water, he felt no weight in his body at all, and he didn\u2019t recognise the feeling, like it had been years since he had been fully relieved of obligations. The sounds around him were natural; birds calling to each other quietly; the water lapping gently at the base of the bank and around his ankles, the grass rustling under his hands as they moved. He heard all this as he remembered the events that had led him here, but they weren\u2019t overtaking the sounds of peace around him. It was warm. There was a sun in the sky. There was no wind. </p><p>Then, there were voices. </p><p>They didn\u2019t come all at once, they came one at a time, the next over taking the first, but he could hear each one clearly. They didn\u2019t overwhelm him or take over the sounds of nature that surrounded him, but they co existed, just like with his thoughts. </p><p>First it was Clint. Then Bruce. James. Steve. Happy. Peter. Morgan. Pepper. With each voice came a new sentence, but what they were saying didn\u2019t seem important. Their voices, he could hear their voices, and his heart was filled with emotion and nothing but good memories. Tears fell down his cheeks, but they weren\u2019t tears of loss or pain. They were the feeling of being whole, the feeling of peace and serenity with the voices of those most important to him surrounding him. They didn\u2019t overwhelm him or deafen him, they were just there. He stared up at the blue sky, the sun warming his back and he sat there, the tears continuing to fall and heal him. </p><p>He was still sitting there when he heard another voice. It wasn\u2019t clearer than the rest, and it didn\u2019t scare the rest away, they were still there, but it was meant to be heard. </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d </p><p>He turned around, and Natasha stood above him, he cheeks glistening with the tears that had brought her peace too, and a smile he was sure was as wide as his.

Like he didn\u2019t carry the weight of any responsibility. </p><p>He opened his eyes. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t blinding, but everything was bright, not harshly bright, but calm. He sat up, aware of his surroundings, but not overwhelmed. He was on a grassy bank in front of the most calm and perfectly coloured lake he could never have pictured before seeing it. In the distance, mountains rose above the water, mountains so grand and green that he thought perhaps he was only making things up, but he couldn\u2019t have made up a view like that. The water and mountains and grass stretched as far as the eye could see, and he saw no one else, but he felt completely safe. </p><p>He stood up and walked down to the lake, hesitantly, he reached out a hand to touch the water lightly with his finger tips, feeling the perfect temperature. A hundred tiny, silver trigger fish swam past his hands, brushing them lightly. He sat down, putting his feet in the water, realising for the first time his face and body were clean. He was in only a white shirt and blue jeans, perhaps the most simple outfit he had been caught in since he had lived in the peak of childhood innocence. </p><p>Staring around, he had never felt more peaceful. He could feel the memories of what had happened in his head, but they didn\u2019t weigh him down. He knew he wasn\u2019t alive, wherever he was, but he was content in feeling this way so he didn\u2019t feel an intense desire to find out. </p><p>His feet in the water, he felt no weight in his body at all, and he didn\u2019t recognise the feeling, like it had been years since he had been fully relieved of obligations. The sounds around him were natural; birds calling to each other quietly; the water lapping gently at the base of the bank and around his ankles, the grass rustling under his hands as they moved. He heard all this as he remembered the events that had led him here, but they weren\u2019t overtaking the sounds of peace around him. It was warm. There was a sun in the sky. There was no wind. </p><p>Then, there were voices. </p><p>They didn\u2019t come all at once, they came one at a time, the next over taking the first, but he could hear each one clearly. They didn\u2019t overwhelm him or take over the sounds of nature that surrounded him, but they co existed, just like with his thoughts. </p><p>First it was Clint. Then Bruce. James. Steve. Happy. Peter. Morgan. Pepper. With each voice came a new sentence, but what they were saying didn\u2019t seem important. Their voices, he could hear their voices, and his heart was filled with emotion and nothing but good memories. Tears fell down his cheeks, but they weren\u2019t tears of loss or pain. They were the feeling of being whole, the feeling of peace and serenity with the voices of those most important to him surrounding him. They didn\u2019t overwhelm him or deafen him, they were just there. He stared up at the blue sky, the sun warming his back and he sat there, the tears continuing to fall and heal him. </p><p>He was still sitting there when he heard another voice. It wasn\u2019t clearer than the rest, and it didn\u2019t scare the rest away, they were still there, but it was meant to be heard. </p><p>\u201cTony.\u201d </p><p>He turned around, and Natasha stood above him, he cheeks glistening with the tears that had brought her peace too, and a smile he was sure was as wide as his. He stood up to embrace her. </p><p>\u201cNat.\u201d </p><p>They held each other tightly for a moment, then they broke apart. She was wearing a black singlet and jeans, her feet bare too, and her red hair flowing out over her shoulders. </p><p>They sat down together, up to their ankles in the water, staring at the hills. </p><p>After a small silence, she looked at him. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d She asked him, and he looked back at her. </p><p>\u201cMy family.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. </p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d </p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cThat I did the right thing.\u201d </p><p>They were quiet again. </p><p>They were lying down on the bank later when Tony spoke. </p><p>\u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d </p><p>She shook her head, staring up at the most brilliant sunset Tony had ever seen, and her face reflected the pink and orange beautifully, making her glow in a whole new light. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to know?\u201d He asked. And she thought for a moment. </p><p>\u201cNo. Is that strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d </p><p>They watched the sun continue to set, and right as it started to fall behind the hills, Nat stood up, reaching out a hand to pull up Tony. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d He asked her, as they clasped hands and began to walk in the direction Nat had come from. </p><p>She considered her reply for a moment, then looked out to the indescribable landscape ahead of them. </p><p>\u201cThat way.\u201d </p>",

His ending with Peggy just feels lame. He\u2019s literally getting with her and erasing the fact that she had a family and moved on from him!</p><p>In Ca:Tfa he throws himself onto what he believes is a grenade in order to save everyone else. Unless we are to believe Steve\u2019s characterization so far is meant to be seen as a noble man spiraling downward into being a liar and an awful friend, then it\u2019s fair to assume he\u2019s still so selfless he\u2019d be willing to die for everybody. He already acts like he\u2019s got nothing but Bucky to live for. </p><p>Meanwhile, Tony\u2019s arc is literally him learning he doesn\u2019t need to put his life on the line, hurt himself, and fall prey to his mental health, all for the sake of the world, and to ease the guilt he feels. He learns he can SETTLE DOWN AND HAVE A FAMILY. </p><p>We don\u2019t even get to see the culmination of Tony\u2019s arc, we don\u2019t get to watch him get his family, or have a large amount of the movie devoted to that no, that development happens off screen. And we get teased with it, for fan service, but we never see his arc come to fruition. </p><p>If he\u2019d had time where we felt he\u2019d managed to finally settle down, and where we felt that five years of peace had really passed for tony stark, we might\u2019ve felt satisfied. Instead, Avengers Endgame feels like a tragedy rather than a victory. </p></p>",
