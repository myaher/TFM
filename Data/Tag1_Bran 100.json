                "content": "<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better title!</p><p>For Anon who asked for a&nbsp;&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; fic of Bran and Arya. I had originally intended for the conversation to go elsewhere but my little shipper heart took over and we got this instead!</p><p>On AO3 <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/18163250\">here</a></p><p>The new stones were white granite, a gift from Tyrion\nLannister, sent along with plans for a new sewage and drain system to\ncomplement the castle&rsquo;s pre-existing heating system. The strangest part of\nTyrion&rsquo;s designs were the empty shafts to be built in the walls. Once installed\nthey could be fitted with a contraption that, with the use of a rope or a\ncrank, could lift passengers from level to level of the castle. If it worked\nBran might never have to be carried up and down the stairs of Winterfell again.\nIt was another kindness that Bran didn&rsquo;t think he deserved. Meera would have\nsharp words for him if she heard those thoughts.</p><p>He was startled when Arya rode close to him, already\nspeaking. &ldquo;What are you brooding about little brother?&rdquo; she asked &ldquo;Brooding\ndoesn&rsquo;t suit you, leave that to Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran huffed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not brooding.&rdquo; Arya made a sound of\nderision and he shook his head, &ldquo;It was just a thought. I don&rsquo;t deserve all\nthese gifts, this kindness.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya reacted as he knew she would, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s stupid. You saved\nus, everyone in Westeros. Everyone in the world maybe! And Tyrion likes you\nanyway. It&rsquo;s impossible not to love you.&rdquo; It was an exaggeration but a kind one\nand arguing with Arya would get him as far as throwing himself from the saddle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well kindness or not I appreciate the materials and the\nplans he sent. If this works no one will have to walk to a well to draw water,\nbathing will be easier &ndash; at least for me, privies will stink less.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; Arya hummed in agreement. &ldquo;Do you think the design\nfor those crutches will work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt I could use them all the time. But they could be\nhelpful, especially when I need to get out of my chair. Or to piss.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya doubled over laughing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a great lord is\nsupposed to talk about pissing in front of a lady!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I seem to recall you preferring honesty to\nprudishness.&rdquo;</p><p>They rode closer to the castle. Once the great gray walls\nwould have loomed ahead of them, but now most of the masonry lay scattered\nabout the fields where the dead had deposited them when they tore the walls\napart. At least most of the keep had been spared the same treatment though the\ncastle had already been in ill repair thanks to the Boltons. </p><p>Those who had survived the war had spent the remainder of\nthe winter huddled in the few buildings or parts of buildings that had\nsurvived. Over time shacks, lean-tos, and huts had been built about the space\nbut Bran had chosen to put an end to it now that the North had recovered\nenough. They had food to spare at last, thanks in part to the irrigation system\nhe&rsquo;d devised, and there were men who needed work. Neither Bran nor any of the\nother residents of Winterfell desired to endure another of the newly short\nwinters trapped in the same few rooms.</p><p><i>Before</i> Bran had\nknown Winterfell better than anyone and that would be true again and seeing his\nhome in ruins had been almost comforting, knowing that it was only broken &ndash;\nlike him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd you know&rdquo; he started, breaking the long silence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\nalways thought of myself as being part of Winterfell, or Winterfell being part\nof me. When it was burned and broken it felt almost right because I&rsquo;m broken &ndash;&rdquo;\nhe held up a hand for silence, &ldquo;&ndash; You know what I mean. Now the castle will be\nrebuilt entirely, or mostly that is. But that cannot happen for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Arya thought over his words, chewing on her lip\nabsentmindedly. &ldquo;Are you referring to your legs or your or something else\nBran?&rdquo; she asked at last.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which part of you can&rsquo;t be fixed? Your legs? Or your\nheart?&rdquo;</p><p>Bran stared, &ldquo;Well my legs obviously can&rsquo;t be healed. I&rsquo;ve\nlearned that over and again. But my&hellip; mind.
