You are writing it, you can fucking justify anything.</p><!-- more --><p>Okay, so for me the whole thing went off the rails completely when they sent Steve By Himself back in time to un-do what a Whole Goddamn Team of them did. Would it not have made more sense for everyone who was on the original mission who was still physically able to go do undo the things they did???</p><p>But okay, I&rsquo;m imposing rules, all the things that we saw happen still have to happen. So.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s that &ldquo;oh yeah, he&rsquo;s gonna do it all himself, I know it took like an hour of screentime and like seven characters the first time, but Steve by himself is gonna do it and it&rsquo;ll be done in eight seconds&rdquo; that was so jarring, I expected &ldquo;put that thing back where it came from&rdquo; to happen between films, or in a separate movie or something, and so having it slapped on the end with a neat bow around it was&hellip; One in a long line of unsatisfying things.</p><p>But if they showed us????</p><p>So endgame was already p long, and unless you were including other characters, it&rsquo;d be difficult and shitty to cut a lot of screen time out just for the wrap up&hellip; But then, that&rsquo;s always the challenge of the last thing in a franchise, so, suck it.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s say Steve going back in time and&hellip; Not showing up again was the end of endgame, or endgame ended on another cliffhanger, maybe after they all got back from the time heist and had the shit blown out of them.</p><p>So then a large chunk of the &ldquo;third&rdquo; endgame film is &ldquo;put that thing back where it came from&rdquo;, either with additional help, as would be sensible, or Steve by himself. Esp if a large chunk of your movie has already been devoted to a tribute/character stuff for Tony, then the latter half is Steve. Doing his thing. We actually see how easy or hard it is for him to return the stones. Maybe get additional set up for future films as he takes the time to un-do the tessaract/loki kerfuffle. Does he have to return Thor&rsquo;s hammer too? This is an opportunity to establish whether your timetravel actually does spawn alt timelines, or  is internally consistent. </p><p>We get to see him meet redskull again.</p><p>Maybe he tries to bargain with him, to trade the stone for Natasha, and learns it doesn&rsquo;t work like that, and has to decide if he&rsquo;s gonna leave the stone with a gaurdian who was once his worst night mare&hellip; For nothing. Maybe we see him face some of that old fear, and find a little closure.</p><p>Maybe we even see him have a convo with shade!Natasha, as he thinks, since Thanos was able to do that with Gamorra, kinda, through the soulstone. She has a further opportunity to explain why she is or is not okay with this turn of events, why she was willing to make that sacrifice and sit-out the happy ending. Why she chose to Stop fighting, rather than persuade Clint to work with her to find a work-around, or something.</p><p>And Steve hits on that idea, the idea of being Done. They have an opportunity to finish out the emotional plotline they opened in Winter soldier, and continued in civil war, where she was trying so hard to be a good friend, wanting so badly to learn how to help her friend find happiness and not be sad anymore.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s in here that he brings up Bucky, brings up the people he would leave behind. Maybe she&rsquo;s the one who makes him take a hard look at what happiness looks like for him. Maybe she&rsquo;s the one who first makes a comment about how resilient ppl like her and Bucky can be, or something. Reminds him that what she had needed, in the end, wasn&rsquo;t One Person (thinking of Clint and or Bruce), but a team, a family, a support network. And she&rsquo;d gotten it.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a little closure there, too.</p><p>And so he returns more stones.</p><p>And then he&rsquo;s in New York, and we maybe see him have a serious conversation with Tilda Swinton&rsquo;s character, another character who, canonically, has faced (or is preparing/prepared to face) what death/retirement/stepping out of the fight looks like. We see Steve struggling with and ultimately making that choice. To step out of his timeline. Or, back into his old timeline. She seems to understand timelines, so we can have a short mechanics-discussion, and&hellip; If it&rsquo;s parallel timelines, then Steve realises he can have his cake and eat it too, he can have Peggy and also rescue Bucky and it won&rsquo;t screw anything up, and he just has to step back into his old timeline to let them know what he chose. (And, I can&rsquo;t help it, maybe drop off his ice-self from the parallel timelines. Just saying)</p><p>Or, if it&rsquo;s not, if the timelines are, idk what it&rsquo;s called, self-healing, then Swinton explains that.</p><p>And so we are brought to understand that if he chooses to go back&hellip; He still can&rsquo;t save Bucky. He could invest all his energy and life into it, but because Bucky wasn&rsquo;t saved, obviously Steve couldn&rsquo;t save him&hellip; But maybe, Steve might realize, the reason Winter Soldier happened the way it did was Because timetravel!Steve had laid groundwork for it. </p><p>And so he realizes that he&rsquo;s gonna decide to stay with Peggy because, like Harry Potter seeing himself across the lake, he already HAS decided that.</p><p>So he does, he stays. </p><p>We see him make the choice, but we don&rsquo;t see what the choice is&hellip;</p><p>And the movie snaps back to everyone waiting on Steve to come back. And he doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And we see the old man on the bench.</p><p>And either immediately then, or in flashbacks between lines he delivers to other characters (falcon, maybe), we see snapshots, maybe no audio, Steve and Peg deciding to lie about who he is, to everyone, doing their best to thwart Hydra, laying the groundwork that would eventually reveal Hydra and expose Bucky and allow what happened to happen. </p><p>We maybe even see the funeral scene, see old!Steve explaining to Sharon (who never officially knew he was Steve Rogers) that he just can&rsquo;t do it. He said some words at the rosary the night before (if they&rsquo;re Catholic), or at the private wake (if they&rsquo;re Irish or Catholic), but he doesn&rsquo;t think he can get up there in the big ceremony, she&rsquo;s all official, a respected member of govt, would she mind terribly?</p><p>And so we get a shot of young Steve and old Steve, on opposite sides of the church, old Steve noticing his younger self, young Steve too stricken to notice.</p><p>And as that part winds down, we realize&hellip;</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s not surprised.</p><p>Bucky&rsquo;s a little sad maybe, but some line, the way he said goodbye before Steve traveled&hellip; We suddenly realize Bucky&rsquo;s not surprised.</p><p>Because he <i>knew</i>.</p><p>Because he was the only character who saw timetravel!Steve and recognized him from before. Maybe because Steve came close to busting him out a time or two&hellip; Hell, maybe that&rsquo;s even part of how Steve gets to the lake unnoticed. Maybe old!Steve has been in contact with Bucky, maybe for a while, maybe since Wakanda, even. And so Bucky knew. Knew what Steve was gonna choose, before Steve did.</p><p>And has had time, a lot of time, maybe. To figure it out. Maybe Steve had originally thought he&rsquo;d give the shield to Bucky, and it was Bucky who turned it down.</p><p>(and maybe that is a thing that we learn in Falcon/Winter Soldier, part of Falcon realizing that Bucky respects him a lot more than he had originally thought)</p><p>Anyway.

Just saying)</p><p>Or, if it\u2019s not, if the timelines are, idk what it\u2019s called, self-healing, then Swinton explains that.</p><p>And so we are brought to understand that if he chooses to go back\u2026 He still can\u2019t save Bucky. He could invest all his energy and life into it, but because Bucky wasn\u2019t saved, obviously Steve couldn\u2019t save him\u2026 But maybe, Steve might realize, the reason Winter Soldier happened the way it did was Because timetravel!Steve had laid groundwork for it. </p><p>And so he realizes that he\u2019s gonna decide to stay with Peggy because, like Harry Potter seeing himself across the lake, he already HAS decided that.</p><p>So he does, he stays. </p><p>We see him make the choice, but we don\u2019t see what the choice is\u2026</p><p>And the movie snaps back to everyone waiting on Steve to come back. And he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And we see the old man on the bench.</p><p>And either immediately then, or in flashbacks between lines he delivers to other characters (falcon, maybe), we see snapshots, maybe no audio, Steve and Peg deciding to lie about who he is, to everyone, doing their best to thwart Hydra, laying the groundwork that would eventually reveal Hydra and expose Bucky and allow what happened to happen. </p><p>We maybe even see the funeral scene, see old!Steve explaining to Sharon (who never officially knew he was Steve Rogers) that he just can\u2019t do it. He said some words at the rosary the night before (if they\u2019re Catholic), or at the private wake (if they\u2019re Irish or Catholic), but he doesn\u2019t think he can get up there in the big ceremony, she\u2019s all official, a respected member of govt, would she mind terribly?</p><p>And so we get a shot of young Steve and old Steve, on opposite sides of the church, old Steve noticing his younger self, young Steve too stricken to notice.</p><p>And as that part winds down, we realize\u2026</p><p>Bucky\u2019s not surprised.</p><p>Bucky\u2019s a little sad maybe, but some line, the way he said goodbye before Steve traveled\u2026 We suddenly realize Bucky\u2019s not surprised.</p><p>Because he <i>knew</i>.</p><p>Because he was the only character who saw timetravel!Steve and recognized him from before. Maybe because Steve came close to busting him out a time or two\u2026 Hell, maybe that\u2019s even part of how Steve gets to the lake unnoticed. Maybe old!Steve has been in contact with Bucky, maybe for a while, maybe since Wakanda, even. And so Bucky knew. Knew what Steve was gonna choose, before Steve did.</p><p>And has had time, a lot of time, maybe. To figure it out. Maybe Steve had originally thought he\u2019d give the shield to Bucky, and it was Bucky who turned it down.</p><p>(and maybe that is a thing that we learn in Falcon/Winter Soldier, part of Falcon realizing that Bucky respects him a lot more than he had originally thought)</p><p>Anyway. It could have been done.</p><p>But much in the way of the Game of Thrones ending, it was done with haste, and without care, and so\u2026 Wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>But it <i>could</i>\u00a0be. </p>",
                "content": "<p>Okay, out of the blue, but if they really wanted Steve to end up with Peggy (for reasons that have nothing to do with gay panic, no sir, not a bit, I&rsquo;m sure)&hellip; They could have done it????? Like, you are literally the ones making this shit up, you could do it well, if you were interested and respected the characters.</p><p>Like, honestly&hellip; A third infinity war/endgame film. </p><p>The biggest issue is that Steve going back to Peggy, staying there, abandoning the present timeline, comes out of nowhere. But you&rsquo;re making the thing! You could make it come from somewhere! You are writing it, you can fucking justify anything.</p><p>Okay, so for me the whole thing went off the rails completely when they sent Steve By Himself back in time to un-do what a Whole Goddamn Team of them did. Would it not have made more sense for everyone who was on the original mission who was still physically able to go do undo the things they did???</p><p>But okay, I&rsquo;m imposing rules, all the things that we saw happen still have to happen. So.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s that &ldquo;oh yeah, he&rsquo;s gonna do it all himself, I know it took like an hour of screentime and like seven characters the first time, but Steve by himself is gonna do it and it&rsquo;ll be done in eight seconds&rdquo; that was so jarring, I expected &ldquo;put that thing back where it came from&rdquo; to happen between films, or in a separate movie or something, and so having it slapped on the end with a neat bow around it was&hellip; One in a long line of unsatisfying things.</p><p>But if they showed us????</p><p>So endgame was already p long, and unless you were including other characters, it&rsquo;d be difficult and shitty to cut a lot of screen time out just for the wrap up&hellip; But then, that&rsquo;s always the challenge of the last thing in a franchise, so, suck it.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s say Steve going back in time and&hellip; Not showing up again was the end of endgame, or endgame ended on another cliffhanger, maybe after they all got back from the time heist and had the shit blown out of them.</p><p>So then a large chunk of the &ldquo;third&rdquo; endgame film is &ldquo;put that thing back where it came from&rdquo;, either with additional help, as would be sensible, or Steve by himself. Esp if a large chunk of your movie has already been devoted to a tribute/character stuff for Tony, then the latter half is Steve. Doing his thing. We actually see how easy or hard it is for him to return the stones. Maybe get additional set up for future films as he takes the time to un-do the tessaract/loki kerfuffle. Does he have to return Thor&rsquo;s hammer too? This is an opportunity to establish whether your timetravel actually does spawn alt timelines, or  is internally consistent. </p><p>We get to see him meet redskull again.</p><p>Maybe he tries to bargain with him, to trade the stone for Natasha, and learns it doesn&rsquo;t work like that, and has to decide if he&rsquo;s gonna leave the stone with a gaurdian who was once his worst night mare&hellip; For nothing. Maybe we see him face some of that old fear, and find a little closure.</p><p>Maybe we even see him have a convo with shade!Natasha, as he thinks, since Thanos was able to do that with Gamorra, kinda, through the soulstone. She has a further opportunity to explain why she is or is not okay with this turn of events, why she was willing to make that sacrifice and sit-out the happy ending. Why she chose to Stop fighting, rather than persuade Clint to work with her to find a work-around, or something.</p><p>And Steve hits on that idea, the idea of being Done. They have an opportunity to finish out the emotional plotline they opened in Winter soldier, and continued in civil war, where she was trying so hard to be a good friend, wanting so badly to learn how to help her friend find happiness and not be sad anymore.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s in here that he brings up Bucky, brings up the people he would leave behind. Maybe she&rsquo;s the one who makes him take a hard look at what happiness looks like for him. Maybe she&rsquo;s the one who first makes a comment about how resilient ppl like her and Bucky can be, or something. Reminds him that what she had needed, in the end, wasn&rsquo;t One Person (thinking of Clint and or Bruce), but a team, a family, a support network. And she&rsquo;d gotten it.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a little closure there, too.</p><p>And so he returns more stones.</p><p>And then he&rsquo;s in New York, and we maybe see him have a serious conversation with Tilda Swinton&rsquo;s character, another character who, canonically, has faced (or is preparing/prepared to face) what death/retirement/stepping out of the fight looks like. We see Steve struggling with and ultimately making that choice. To step out of his timeline. Or, back into his old timeline. She seems to understand timelines, so we can have a short mechanics-discussion, and&hellip; If it&rsquo;s parallel timelines, then Steve realises he can have his cake and eat it too, he can have Peggy and also rescue Bucky and it won&rsquo;t screw anything up, and he just has to step back into his old timeline to let them know what he chose. (And, I can&rsquo;t help it, maybe drop off his ice-self from the parallel timelines.

This dream version of Endgame was a bizarrely different movie and here are some scenes that I remember:</p><p>Peter Quill, Loki and the Hulk were traveling together on a spaceship. They were flying around the whole universe looking for something and having odd adventures.</p><p>One day Peter wanted to eat a toast, but there was only one last slice of bread left. And because that last slice was old, it had dried up into something &lsquo;U&rsquo; shaped. Peter was trying to fit it into ordinary toaster. It didn&rsquo;t fit in. So he threw a temper tantrum like a two years old who is trying to fit a square block in a round hole, and smashed to pieces both the last piece of bread and the poor toaster. (I recall saying to the guys on my left something along these lines &ldquo;this scene is a metaphor for how bad the whole movie is&rdquo; and we agreed that this movie is a garbage. \u00a0Another guy on my left shouted &ldquo;yo, fuck this movie!&rdquo; and left the cinema)</p><p>Loki and Hulk had a deal that if Hulk destroys something serious on this spaceship (or injures another person) more than three times, Loki and Peter are allowed to kick him out. One day the alarm onboard went on, because Hulk was smashing something again.<br/>Loki, hearing the noise, stood up, with one hand brushed his hair away from his face and went to see what is going on. \u00a0And what hair it was! Twice as long as when we had last seen him! Freshly washed and combed! A beautiful black cascade of soft and silky waves (I watched the whole movie twice, for his hair only). Loki, when he was lost in his thoughts, had also a habit to play with his hair or start to make a tiny braid. Ok, but back to the plot: So Loki went to check on Hulk. It shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to find him if he becomes very big every time when he gets angry, right? On his way to Hulk, Loki passed by a whiteboard, on which he and Peter were marking how many times Hulk had destroyed something already. Yep, three marks on it. Loki opened the nearest door only to be meet with a wall of green and a small sad face that had said &ldquo;Hulk sorry&rdquo;. \u00a0</p><p>The trio from this spaceship agreed to leave Hulk on the nearest peaceful planet. It turned out to be actually a moon named Pandora (yes, the moon from the movie Avatar directed by James Cameron), Hulk was happy to stay with these big blue humanoids called Na\u02bcvi. \nNa\u02bcvi \nwere less enthusiastic about it.</p><p>Some time later Loki and Peter arrived on Earth. They landed somewhere in Slovakia, I think. Local authorities, represented by two laid-back policemen, entered the spaceship and asked them for ID. These policemen liked to make a serious first impression, so they asked for ID as if they were to shoot down anyone who dared to disobey them. Loki had only an old and damaged fake ID from a bag of dorito chips, that stated that his name is Spock. Peter had fake ID from another flavor of doritos - he was James T. Kirk. The policemen looked briefly at these ID&rsquo;s and wished them a good day. Loki had put so much thoughts into coming up with what to write as a personal info on the back of the ID and the policemen didn&rsquo;t even bothered to read it. Maybe it was for the better, because he had written it with a pencil.</p><p>In the basement of the local hospital Loki and Peter managed to find Thor, who was hiding here from someone. Thor was blue. Jotun blue. He just looked like a regular Jotun, but with a blond hair. Apparently it was totally normal for Thor to sometimes look like this, because no one commented on it. Natasha Romanoff also was here (she had cool long braid like in the real Endgame). After some talking all four of our heroes went back to the spaceship and flew off the Earth. </p><p>Flashback scene: Many years ago, when Natasha was a teenager, she was in this hospital because she was dying of cancer. Thor was also here, because he wanted to cure her. Whatever he had done, it worked, because he was&hellip; Natasha&rsquo;s father. None of these two were aware about their consanguinity (not in this flashback and not in the next scenes). However Yondu and Bucky, who also were here, knew that Natasha is Thor&rsquo;s daughter. </p><p>Back to present: Natasha and Thor had a vague impression that they had already met each other a long time ago, and that Yondu and Bucky are somehow involved in this, so they convinced Loki and Peter to go looking for them. After some searching Peter found an info that Barnes is off Earth, because Yondu just took him to an educational trip to another galaxy.</p>",

This dream version of Endgame was a bizarrely different movie and here are some scenes that I remember:</p><p>Peter Quill, Loki and the Hulk were traveling together on a spaceship. They were flying around the whole universe looking for something and having odd adventures.</p><p>One day Peter wanted to eat a toast, but there was only one last slice of bread left. And because that last slice was old, it had dried up into something \u2018U\u2019 shaped. Peter was trying to fit it into ordinary toaster. It didn\u2019t fit in. So he threw a temper tantrum like a two years old who is trying to fit a square block in a round hole, and smashed to pieces both the last piece of bread and the poor toaster. (I recall saying to the guys on my left something along these lines \u201cthis scene is a metaphor for how bad the whole movie is\u201d and we agreed that this movie is a garbage. \u00a0Another guy on my left shouted \u201cyo, fuck this movie!\u201d and left the cinema)</p><p>Loki and Hulk had a deal that if Hulk destroys something serious on this spaceship (or injures another person) more than three times, Loki and Peter are allowed to kick him out. One day the alarm onboard went on, because Hulk was smashing something again.<br>Loki, hearing the noise, stood up, with one hand brushed his hair away from his face and went to see what is going on. \u00a0And what hair it was! Twice as long as when we had last seen him! Freshly washed and combed! A beautiful black cascade of soft and silky waves (I watched the whole movie twice, for his hair only). Loki, when he was lost in his thoughts, had also a habit to play with his hair or start to make a tiny braid. Ok, but back to the plot: So Loki went to check on Hulk. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to find him if he becomes very big every time when he gets angry, right? On his way to Hulk, Loki passed by a whiteboard, on which he and Peter were marking how many times Hulk had destroyed something already. Yep, three marks on it. Loki opened the nearest door only to be meet with a wall of green and a small sad face that had said \u201cHulk sorry\u201d. \u00a0</p><p>The trio from this spaceship agreed to leave Hulk on the nearest peaceful planet. It turned out to be actually a moon named Pandora (yes, the moon from the movie Avatar directed by James Cameron), Hulk was happy to stay with these big blue humanoids called Na\u02bcvi. \nNa\u02bcvi \nwere less enthusiastic about it.</p><p>Some time later Loki and Peter arrived on Earth. They landed somewhere in Slovakia, I think. Local authorities, represented by two laid-back policemen, entered the spaceship and asked them for ID. These policemen liked to make a serious first impression, so they asked for ID as if they were to shoot down anyone who dared to disobey them. Loki had only an old and damaged fake ID from a bag of dorito chips, that stated that his name is Spock. Peter had fake ID from another flavor of doritos - he was James T. Kirk. The policemen looked briefly at these ID\u2019s and wished them a good day. Loki had put so much thoughts into coming up with what to write as a personal info on the back of the ID and the policemen didn\u2019t even bothered to read it. Maybe it was for the better, because he had written it with a pencil.</p><p>In the basement of the local hospital Loki and Peter managed to find Thor, who was hiding here from someone. Thor was blue. Jotun blue. He just looked like a regular Jotun, but with a blond hair. Apparently it was totally normal for Thor to sometimes look like this, because no one commented on it. Natasha Romanoff also was here (she had cool long braid like in the real Endgame). After some talking all four of our heroes went back to the spaceship and flew off the Earth. </p><p>Flashback scene: Many years ago, when Natasha was a teenager, she was in this hospital because she was dying of cancer. Thor was also here, because he wanted to cure her. Whatever he had done, it worked, because he was\u2026 Natasha\u2019s father. None of these two were aware about their consanguinity (not in this flashback and not in the next scenes). However Yondu and Bucky, who also were here, knew that Natasha is Thor\u2019s daughter. </p><p>Back to present: Natasha and Thor had a vague impression that they had already met each other a long time ago, and that Yondu and Bucky are somehow involved in this, so they convinced Loki and Peter to go looking for them. After some searching Peter found an info that Barnes is off Earth, because Yondu just took him to an educational trip to another galaxy.</p>",
