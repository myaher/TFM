And probably never will be.<br/></p><p>The saying \u201cEvery time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin\u201d is used to explain away every Targaryen misdeed or heroic act. The assumption is that, after centuries of inbreeding, \u201cmadness\u201d (an incredibly vague term that really does nothing to describe someone\u2019s mental state and therefore makes it difficult to distinguish between insanity and greatness) is inherited genetically. There\u2019s no proof that this is true for the Targaryens, and especially not for Dany.</p><!-- more --><p>The northerners have their wargs, yet no one would call them insane for claiming they can take over someone or something else\u2019s body. The Targaryens have their own kind of magic: dragon dreams. Dragon dreams are premonition-like dreams that often involve dragons, but not always. Like all prophecies, these dreams are not simple to interpret. Aerion Targaryen drank wildfire believing it would turn him into a dragon: clearly madness, right? Except that it was dragon dreams that led to Dany walking into the fire, leading to the hatching of her three dragons. If she had burnt to a crisp, they would have called her mad, but because she correctly interpreted her dragon dreams, she becomes the Mother of Dragons. Madness, it seems, all depends on the outcome of taking a risk.</p><p>In ASOIAF, it\u2019s clearly Cersei who is the \u201cMad\u201d Queen. Her behavior is partially a result of her circumstances and the abuses she\u2019s endured, yes, but she was never of sound mental health. She murders her best friend as a child out of jealousy/a perceived threat to her relationship with Jaime. She loves Jaime and her children only insofar as they are an extension of herself. The irony is that, in rebelling against the Mad King, the realm still ends up with a Mad Queen in power, one with a lifelong history of sociopathic tendencies and even an obsession with wildfire. She enjoys hurting people, does not recognize the interior lives of others, and is unrepentant.</p><p>So that brings us back to Dany. Dany shows no signs of mental illness. She\u2019s a good person who spent her childhood being abused by her brother and chased by assassins, only to be sold to a warlord and raped nightly. Her only defense is to adapt to her situation and find ways to gain the upper hand. She can behave ruthlessly, but she agonizes over every decision and despairs at harming innocents. When we leave her in the books, it seems she understands that she cannot go on compromising, and that innocents will have to die in order for her to achieve her goals. Innocents are ALREADY dying. Westeros is at war. She believes that if she joins the fray, she has the power to bring peace. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky, because we\u2019ve run out of books, so in order to justify her turn as the \u201cMad Queen\u201d we have to go back and completely reframe her actions and intentions throughout the show. \u201cShe\u2019s killed thousands of people!\u201d Well, yes, she\u2019s killed rapists and murderers. Ned Stark, arguably the most honorable character in the series, enters the story by decapitating a scared deserter of the Night\u2019s Watch. Jon hangs a literal child. Tyrion, who is SO opposed to dragonfire at the end of the series, had no qualms about blowing up the Baratheon army with wildfire during the Battle of the Blackwater. Arya literally baked potentially innocent men into a pie and fed it to their father. Killing people has never been an issue in this series; but of ALL the characters, Daenerys seems the most justified in her actions, because the people she shows mercy to are the oppressed and those at the receiving end of her wrath are irredeemably bad people. You can argue she makes these choices to be loved, and perhaps that\u2019s true, but her actions often go against her own best interests. Staying in Meereen to rule does nothing to benefit her. Helping the North, who pays her absolute dust for saving their asses, does not benefit her either; she could have stayed on Dragonstone.

The Targaryens have their own kind of magic: dragon dreams. Dragon dreams are premonition-like dreams that often involve dragons, but not always. Like all prophecies, these dreams are not simple to interpret. Aerion Targaryen drank wildfire believing it would turn him into a dragon: clearly madness, right? Except that it was dragon dreams that led to Dany walking into the fire, leading to the hatching of her three dragons.

She murders her best friend as a child out of jealousy/a perceived threat to her relationship with Jaime. She loves Jaime and her children only insofar as they are an extension of herself. The irony is that, in rebelling against the Mad King, the realm still ends up with a Mad Queen in power, one with a lifelong history of sociopathic tendencies and even an obsession with wildfire. She enjoys hurting people, does not recognize the interior lives of others, and is unrepentant.</p><p>So that brings us back to Dany. Dany shows no signs of mental illness. She\u2019s a good person who spent her childhood being abused by her brother and chased by assassins, only to be sold to a warlord and raped nightly. Her only defense is to adapt to her situation and find ways to gain the upper hand. She can behave ruthlessly, but she agonizes over every decision and despairs at harming innocents. When we leave her in the books, it seems she understands that she cannot go on compromising, and that innocents will have to die in order for her to achieve her goals. Innocents are ALREADY dying. Westeros is at war. She believes that if she joins the fray, she has the power to bring peace. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky, because we\u2019ve run out of books, so in order to justify her turn as the \u201cMad Queen\u201d we have to go back and completely reframe her actions and intentions throughout the show. \u201cShe\u2019s killed thousands of people!\u201d Well, yes, she\u2019s killed rapists and murderers. Ned Stark, arguably the most honorable character in the series, enters the story by decapitating a scared deserter of the Night\u2019s Watch. Jon hangs a literal child. Tyrion, who is SO opposed to dragonfire at the end of the series, had no qualms about blowing up the Baratheon army with wildfire during the Battle of the Blackwater. Arya literally baked potentially innocent men into a pie and fed it to their father. Killing people has never been an issue in this series; but of ALL the characters, Daenerys seems the most justified in her actions, because the people she shows mercy to are the oppressed and those at the receiving end of her wrath are irredeemably bad people. You can argue she makes these choices to be loved, and perhaps that\u2019s true, but her actions often go against her own best interests. Staying in Meereen to rule does nothing to benefit her. Helping the North, who pays her absolute dust for saving their asses, does not benefit her either; she could have stayed on Dragonstone. But she agreed to help WITHOUT Jon kneeling to her, which came later. She consistently makes decisions to help others that only hurt her cause.

Each kingdom will send forth 2 representatives - one from the nobility and one elected by the people.&rdquo;</p><p>The room filled with gasps and grumbles.</p><p>&ldquo;You have six moon turns to gather here,&rdquo; Daenerys continued , &ldquo;And then the real work will begin.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Red Horse: War</b></p><p>It was a shock to more people than it should have been when she appeared at the head of the northern army. Her red hair caught the little sunlight that had emerged after the long winter.</p><p>The south had not been ready, but the North always remembers. Winter is coming. Now that the snows had started to melt, it came again. This time in the form of a little bird who had never truly been a bird.</p><p>Red ran through the streets just as it ran down her back. The south fell, one keep at a time. They stopped at the mountains, where the Dornish had assembled to meet them.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done no wrong to me or mine.&rdquo; Sansa Stark inclined her head to Arianna Martell. &ldquo;I have no want for Dorne.&rdquo;</p><p>The Princess of Dorne inclined her head in return, &ldquo;And what is the Queen in the North does want?&rdquo;</p><p>Painted lips quirked up in a smile, &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo;</p><p>The northern host turned around. Tens of thousands of men and nearly so many horses trampled back over the land from which they&rsquo;d come. They took with them only that which they&rsquo;d come for: the bones of their fallen and the lives of those who&rsquo;d slain them.</p><p>When Sansa Stark sat upon her wooden throne in Winterfell the crown placed upon her head was forged in iron just like the one worn by the Old Kings of Winter.</p><p>&ldquo;The lone wolf dies,&rdquo; Sansa told the lords and ladies and peasants gathered in the godswood, &ldquo;but the pack survives.&rdquo; Cheers rang out. Sansa did not smile, she searched the crowd for a familiar face. None appeared.</p><p><b>The Black Horse: Famine</b></p><p>With Tommen&rsquo;s death, Cersei abandoned her red and gold gowns. She dressed in black as if a member of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Her watch was not of some barren wasteland covered in ice, but of a city filled to the brim with rats and people.</p><p>Personally, she preferred the rats. They didn&rsquo;t cry and beg at her door, they didn&rsquo;t scream or shout at her as she walked through the streets.</p><p>&ldquo;Your highness,&rdquo; some snot-nosed lord was bowed at the waist as he addressed her. Cersei sipped her wine. The council all eyed the man with bored faces, &ldquo;My people are starving.&rdquo;</p><p>Cersei snorted, &ldquo;The whole of the seven kingdoms is starving.&rdquo; She snatched a grape from the dish in front of her, &ldquo;What makes your people so special that I should open my stores for them?&rdquo;</p><p>The lord eyed her table. The grapes were not alone upon the wooden surface, dishes of fruits and meats sat ready for the council to partake.</p><p>&ldquo;I will give you the same advice I have given every lord who has graced me with this same request,&rdquo; Cersei stood from her seat. The council all straightened. &ldquo;Ration well.&rdquo;</p><p>With a wave of her hand the man was taken from her sight by knights with red cloaks. He yelled. They all did. He cursed her. They all did.</p><p>&ldquo;Might I suggest we take further requests for aid in the throne room, my queen?&rdquo; It was her Master of Whispers, Cersei had long forgotten his name at this point. The Seven help her, she missed Varys.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Cersei popped another grape into her mouth. She began to walk the table, &ldquo;We will hear no more requests for food.&rdquo; She stalked from the room, &ldquo;I am their queen, I have more important matters to deal with.&rdquo;</p><p>The council rose, bowed, and watched her leave. The Kingsguard followed after her, appearing like ghosts from around the room.</p><p>The Master of Whisper sighed, &ldquo;So says the queen.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Pale Horse: Death</b></p><p>No one in Winterfell batted an eye at the appearance of a man in rags. The winter had been harsh, there were many beggars. Even more now, with the border to the south clear.</p><p>Despite the shorter growing periods and the fewer people, the North had fared much better than the southern kingdoms through the long night. It worked to her advantage as she slipped into the castle.</p><p>She&rsquo;d taken advantage of the horrors and dark of the winter. Her list had finished.</p><p>Cersei. The Mountain. The Hound. Dunsen. Lorch. Ilyn Payne. Trant.</p><p>They were all dead. House Frey with them. She&rsquo;d visited the Dreadfor to finish, but had found it abandoned. Rumors on the road to Winterfell was that House Boltan had been ended by the Queen in the North.</p><p>Arya Stark. It had been a while since she&rsquo;d slipped into her own face. She did though, as she entered the godswood.</p><p>Queen Sansa held court in the godswood, before the eyes of the gods. Arya hung back, listened as her sister heard the needs of her people. Their people.</p><p>Rickon had been returned from Skagos. Or so rumors said. But he was wild and illiterate and unwilling to take his sister&rsquo;s crown. The north had gone the way of Dorne then, changed the laws so that daughters held equal rights to their father&rsquo;s names and holdings.</p><p>Arya&rsquo;d heard the grumblings in the courtyard. The assassin never got close to Sansa. Nor would any other.</p><p>The Queen in the North would be protected by the Lord of Death. This, she swore. Valar morghulis.</p><p>All men must die, but Sansa was not a man.</p></p>",
