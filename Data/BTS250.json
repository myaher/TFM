But he is far from perfect; he\u2019s had his off days and moments where he just wanted to accept the negative emotions. It wasn\u2019t healthy of him to just keep being happy all the time. He was better than that.</p><p>But for the sake of his other members and for Army, he would gladly give all the smiles and overflowing energy he could possibly give. He was after all \u201cJ-Hope\u201d: the hope of all the Army. So when he met you, his world turned upside down and inside out.</p><p>He always believed that he was the luckiest guy in the world; because you could see right through him in ways no one else would (well, except for his members and his family) and you always encouraged him to open up about his true feelings versus the emotions he portrayed onstage. You saw him for who he truly was and you could read him like a book.</p><p>\u201cBaby? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Hoseok twitched in surprise when your voice broke his train of thoughts. He was confused for a few seconds until he realized that he was in your condo; your figure cuddled at his side while his arm was around you hugging you close to his body. The sound of rain and wind hitting the windows echoed throughout your bedroom. Your laptop was left untouched on his lap with the credits from the movie you just watched rolling in. He set it aside carefully and pulled in your comforter closer to the both of you.</p><p>He saw your face streaked with tears and your eyes puffy from all the crying. He completely forgot that he was there comforting you.</p><p>\u201cI should be asking you that, Y/N. How are you feeling now, baby?\u201d He softly smiled as he gave you a kiss on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, still a bit anxious but I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go all the way here. I know you\u2019ve been so busy with the upcoming tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no worry, baby. I was due for a rest day anyway so I\u2019d rather spend it with you.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have to be early with Yoongi and Namjoon? You guys have to go over the rap line set first thing in the morning!\u201d You exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. My focus is on you. I\u2019m not leaving this place until I know you\u2019re completely okay and that I get to see that beautiful smile again.\u201d He said as he softly caressed your face.</p><p>The simple gesture caused you to blush and hide your face on his chest. Hoseok laughed at your reaction and lightly poked your forehead. He grabbed your other hand from underneath the comforter and intertwined his fingers with yours.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had to see me like this.\u201d You murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve broken down in front of someone in a long while. The last person who witnessed pointed out that I was doing it for drama and attention. \u00a0That it was an ugly sight to see. So when I grew up and it happens, I found solace in just hiding until I\u2019m okay. That\u2019s why I never left the condo for a week now.\u201d You confessed with an embarrassed tone; refusing to look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to walk away now that you know.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was stunned to hear those words from you. Never in his life did he ever think to walk away.</p><p>His lips formed a pout as he nuzzled his face in your hair.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason I should stay. I would never walk away from you. Whoever that person was, was wrong. <b>I think you\u2019re beautiful.</b> I\u2019m sorry he or she judged you for showing weakness and vulnerability. You had to carry all of that with you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m actually beautiful? In this state?\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cCorrection, I don\u2019t think, I KNOW. And yes, you are still beautiful, baby. No one should tell you otherwise. You\u2019re beautiful the moment I laid my eyes on you all the way until you shared to me your raw emotions. You\u2019re beautiful both inside and out. You\u2019re beautiful in all ways.\u201d He reiterated as he showered you with kisses on your forehead once again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not happy all the time, baby. Didn\u2019t you teach me that as well?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t hold back and just let yourself feel all the emotions that you\u2019re feeling right now. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you won\u2019t leave until you see me smile again? It\u2019s gonna take time though&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Namjoon and Yoongi can just ask the others to cover for me; even if it takes the next few days. Everyone in Bangtan can rap anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoseok, no\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoseok, yes! Don\u2019t you worry about my work, love. You\u2019re my priority right now and I\u2019m here holding you. It\u2019s my turn now to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>You finally looked into his eyes and saw the sincerity it held for the words he told you. He was determined to stay and that helped the anxious feelings you had deep inside to go away. You gave him a tiny smile and a soft kiss of appreciation.</p><p>You\u2019ve never felt so loved before by a man who was portrayed as the happiest person you could possibly encounter but was actually just the same as you. He truly was a walking ray of sunshine.</p><p>Hoseok all the more believed that hope comes in the form of a smile, a laugh, or even in tears; that there was always love no matter what storm brews in.</p><hr><p><i>*requested by: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9H4xs-P-qhlaV4CwdYRpPA\" target=\"_blank\">@gnailil</a></i></p>",

He grabbed your other hand from underneath the comforter and intertwined his fingers with yours.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you had to see me like this.\u201d You murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d He asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve broken down in front of someone in a long while. The last person who witnessed pointed out that I was doing it for drama and attention. \u00a0That it was an ugly sight to see. So when I grew up and it happens, I found solace in just hiding until I\u2019m okay. That\u2019s why I never left the condo for a week now.\u201d You confessed with an embarrassed tone; refusing to look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to walk away now that you know.\u201d</p><p>Hoseok was stunned to hear those words from you. Never in his life did he ever think to walk away.</p><p>His lips formed a pout as he nuzzled his face in your hair.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason I should stay. I would never walk away from you. Whoever that person was, was wrong. <b>I think you\u2019re beautiful.</b> I\u2019m sorry he or she judged you for showing weakness and vulnerability. You had to carry all of that with you for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m actually beautiful? In this state?\u201d You whispered.</p><p>\u201cCorrection, I don\u2019t think, I KNOW. And yes, you are still beautiful, baby. No one should tell you otherwise. You\u2019re beautiful the moment I laid my eyes on you all the way until you shared to me your raw emotions. You\u2019re beautiful both inside and out. You\u2019re beautiful in all ways.\u201d He reiterated as he showered you with kisses on your forehead once again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not happy all the time, baby. Didn\u2019t you teach me that as well?\u201d He teased.</p><p>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t hold back and just let yourself feel all the emotions that you\u2019re feeling right now. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you won\u2019t leave until you see me smile again? It\u2019s gonna take time though\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Namjoon and Yoongi can just ask the others to cover for me; even if it takes the next few days. Everyone in Bangtan can rap anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoseok, no\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoseok, yes! Don\u2019t you worry about my work, love. You\u2019re my priority right now and I\u2019m here holding you. It\u2019s my turn now to be there for you.\u201d</p><p>You finally looked into his eyes and saw the sincerity it held for the words he told you. He was determined to stay and that helped the anxious feelings you had deep inside to go away. You gave him a tiny smile and a soft kiss of appreciation.</p><p>You\u2019ve never felt so loved before by a man who was portrayed as the happiest person you could possibly encounter but was actually just the same as you. He truly was a walking ray of sunshine.</p><p>Hoseok all the more believed that hope comes in the form of a smile, a laugh, or even in tears; that there was always love no matter what storm brews in.</p><hr><p><i>*requested by: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9H4xs-P-qhlaV4CwdYRpPA\" target=\"_blank\">@gnailil</a></i></p></p>",

Maybe it was how he and his sister were brought up or the wisdom that their parents bestowed upon them. No matter how dire the problem was, he knew there was still hope.<b><br /></b></p><p>He&rsquo;d like to think that life was too short to just dwell on the negativity. But he is far from perfect; he&rsquo;s had his off days and moments where he just wanted to accept the negative emotions. It wasn&rsquo;t healthy of him to just keep being happy all the time. He was better than that.</p><p>But for the sake of his other members and for Army, he would gladly give all the smiles and overflowing energy he could possibly give. He was after all &ldquo;J-Hope&rdquo;: the hope of all the Army. So when he met you, his world turned upside down and inside out.</p><p>He always believed that he was the luckiest guy in the world; because you could see right through him in ways no one else would (well, except for his members and his family) and you always encouraged him to open up about his true feelings versus the emotions he portrayed onstage. You saw him for who he truly was and you could read him like a book.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby? You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Hoseok twitched in surprise when your voice broke his train of thoughts. He was confused for a few seconds until he realized that he was in your condo; your figure cuddled at his side while his arm was around you hugging you close to his body. The sound of rain and wind hitting the windows echoed throughout your bedroom. Your laptop was left untouched on his lap with the credits from the movie you just watched rolling in. He set it aside carefully and pulled in your comforter closer to the both of you.</p><p>He saw your face streaked with tears and your eyes puffy from all the crying. He completely forgot that he was there comforting you.</p><p>&ldquo;I should be asking you that, Y/N. How are you feeling now, baby?&rdquo; He softly smiled as he gave you a kiss on the forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, still a bit anxious but I&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo; You whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you had to go all the way here. I know you&rsquo;ve been so busy with the upcoming tour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no worry, baby. I was due for a rest day anyway so I&rsquo;d rather spend it with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up at him in surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you have to be early with Yoongi and Namjoon? You guys have to go over the rap line set first thing in the morning!&rdquo; You exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be fine. My focus is on you. I&rsquo;m not leaving this place until I know you&rsquo;re completely okay and that I get to see that beautiful smile again.&rdquo; He said as he softly caressed your face.</p><p>The simple gesture caused you to blush and hide your face on his chest. Hoseok laughed at your reaction and lightly poked your forehead. He grabbed your other hand from underneath the comforter and intertwined his fingers with yours.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you had to see me like this.&rdquo; You murmured.</p><p>&ldquo;And why is that?&rdquo; He asked slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve broken down in front of someone in a long while.

However, an assignment was an assignment and nothing- and I mean nothing- would stop you from perfecting your clean score. Jimin had been a star in helping you out visually after hearing of yours and Jungkook&rsquo;s newest task, rooting carelessly through your wardrobe to brandish a more than eye catching piece. Demons apparently had a thing for musky colours and leather according to what the incubus had told you, and that much was clear from the black, leather pants squeezing your legs and the rouge brallete which you wanted nothing more than to cover. The demon had slipped an ankle flattering pair of heels onto your feet and dolled you all up just before Jungkook could announce that you had to head out, pronto. </p><p>He had done a double take the moment you shuffled miserably out from your bedroom, mumbling something about a 'damn cl\u00edche trope&rsquo; under your breath as Jimin emerged after you, a look of pride evident on his face that Jungkook fed into with a sheepish compliment. Tae was already sat at the door, eager to leave with Hoseok by his side who watched the canine skeptically but happily stroked through his fur. A compliment slips the witches lips and whilst Jimin&rsquo;s ego inflates once more, you on the other hand shrink in on yourself, whispering a shy 'thanks&rsquo; which evoked a pearly grin from Hoseok. &ldquo;Jiminie I think you&rsquo;ve done God&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; Jungkook whistles lowly, shrugging on his black bomber jacket whilst swiftly handing you a miniscule ear piece which you applied instantly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know there was a female under all that slob.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I swear to God,&rdquo; You run your bandaged hand through you hair, evoking a whine of irritation from the incubus which halts your movement. Oh yeah, right. Your hair was&hellip;styled&hellip;for once. &ldquo;I will staple your dick to the wall.&rdquo; Jungkook blanches at your words, hands moving as subtly as they could to protect his 'precious jewels&rsquo; all the while you rolled your eyes and bowed your head in thanks to Hoseok as he helped you pull your jacket on. &ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; The witch asks, looking over the three of you whilst one of his hands rested atop of Tae&rsquo;s head. </p><p>&ldquo;Ready to be leered at, molested and possibly groped? Sure.&rdquo; You fake enthusiasm, missing the sympathetic looks they all send you as Hoseok takes your hand and a purple puff of smoke swallows you both up as well as Tae, only to deposit you seconds later directly outside the <i>Purgatory</i>. Two other frames drop by and maroon smoke clears to reveal Jungkook and Jimin. Your stomach coils, and the Incubus already expects it. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t throw up. I spent a lot of time on you and I don&rsquo;t want your incapacity to hold down your lunch after fast flashing to ruin it all.&rdquo; </p><p>Fast flashing. It was something all supernatural beings could do, and you hated it. You really did. </p><p>You throw him a heated glare and salute him with your middle finger, hunched over as you heaved through the feeling that gripped at your insides. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sorry, but not all of us can be naturally accustomed to travelling faster than the recorded speed of light.&rdquo; Jungkook moves to press at the skin of your stomach which the brallete leaves exposed, his cold hands (which he constantly had) cooling you down in an instant as the pads of his fingers skimmed across your skin and left goosebumps in their wake. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; He inquires softly with an incline of his head. You nod, straightening your posture and flashing a smile filled with gratitude his way. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you roll your shoulders back and crack your neck to the side with a heavy, reluctant sigh. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get this over with.&rdquo; Ducking your way into the club, warped lights twist before your very eyes and distinctive bodies are hard to be made out as everything seems to bleed together. You don&rsquo;t shy away from the electric atmosphere though, not once, because this is isn&rsquo;t your first rodeo. The group disperse in a heartbeat, Jimin finds a flock of bodies to entice and with him he takes a flustered Jungkook. Hoseok awkwardly moves off to a booth with Tae at his heels, which leaves you to sit forlornly at the bar, beckoning the bartender over with an incline of your head. The burning liquid in the shot glass slides down your throat in a heartbeat, and in fascination, you eye the black, pointed stumps which protrude from the side of the tenders head. A demon, clearly. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, he confirms it all by flashing you a black eyed wink after catching you openly checking him out. He&rsquo;s about to lean across the oaken bar top, no doubt with the intention to somehow get on your good side, however, the abrupt introduction of a new presence is noticed by both you and him as you look to your side and spot a lanky male seated besides you, dressed mostly in black. </p><p>&ldquo;Eleeze! Good to see you man!&rdquo; The horned demon exclaims happily, a wide grin spread across his face as Eleeze bowed his head back in greeting, mumbling a coy 'good to see you too Damion&rsquo; under his breath. Thankfully, both demons are too caught up to pick up on the way you stiffen and choke on your own breath. You&rsquo;re about to call the demon for another shot when it seems Eleeze beats you to it. &ldquo;A shot of whiskey.&rdquo; He demands, and Damion puckers his lips before turning away to fetch the requested drink. Meanwhile, you can&rsquo;t even begin to comprehend what has you so terribly frozen with fear, limbs like lead and head swarming as a cold sweat began on your palms, skin clammy and flushed with apprehension. You think desperately about blowing your cover just to escape the uneasy feeling which holds you captive, and the words swim clearly around your mind, but&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t you who says them. </p><p>His voice is like nails dragging specifically across glass, eliciting a shudder up your spine, and your best friends name on his tongue sounds even more sinister. The mere act of it seeming to send a catapult straight through you stomach, and ah, there you go again, sick to your stomach once more. &ldquo;<i>Jungkook, I don&rsquo;t feel good. Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</i>&rdquo; You breath quickens, the seat which you were sitting on, now strewn across the floor under the sheer impact of how quickly you stood. The sudden movement garners the wary, watchful gazes of your teammates but they make no move to intercept just yet. You breath tremors, and Eleeze hasn&rsquo;t even looked at you yet, hasn&rsquo;t <i>even</i> bothered to acknowledge you until your making a heated attempt to escape and his bony hand is snatching up your wrist in the blink of an eye. The demon whirls you around, black eyes meeting the wavering orbs of your own and he glances down, <i>only</i> for a second, to scan the bandages wrapped around your hand. A malicious smirk splits his thinly, cracked lips. &ldquo; Looks like he was the right man for the job after all.&rdquo; He darkly muses, the words pulling tightly at your throat as all you wish to do right now is scream. The motion seems to ultimately get stuck though, just like how the rest of your body remains. Paralysed, beneath his intentful gaze. &ldquo;Such a shame that I lost him to that mutt of yours. Nevermind though! I have you here now, and that&rsquo;s all that matters&hellip;right?&rdquo; </p><p>You shift you gaze over to where you can faintly make out Hoseok&rsquo;s form in the booth, his name resting just on the tip of your tongue. However, once more, he beats you to it. &ldquo;<i>Hoseok, help me!</i>&rdquo; Eleeze manages to mock your very words, and you can&rsquo;t understand why as fanged teeth are cruelly presented behind thinly stretched lips. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; He chimes. &ldquo;Are you going to come willingly?&rdquo; He flashes you a smile. &ldquo;Or am I going to have to do this the hard way?&rdquo; He narrows his eyes threateningly.  </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you mumble, the familiar sensation of fight or flight beginning to bubble heatedly in the lower pits of your stomach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t stick around long enough to choose.&rdquo; He frowns, and in turn you attempt to spin out of his grasp, momentum twisting Eleeze&rsquo;s own body to face the bar where you slam his face against the oak whilst hissing through the sharp, fiery feeling which engulfs your upper arm. Jumping back from the demons frame, you hold your hand to your throbbing arm and pull it back to find it glistening red as Eleeze flashes you a glistening knife which is stained only the slightest. &ldquo;You son of a bitch.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you one way or another Y/n! Just watch!&rdquo; Is all he cackles, deflated against the oaken top as you allowed the dancing crowd to swallow you up, looking for the first familiar face you could stumble across. Hoseok catches you before you stumble pathetically to the ground, noting the tears stuck stubbornly to the ends of your lashes and the blatant trembling of your lip. The witch frantically calls your name, determined to find out what&rsquo;s wrong but all you can do is crumble against his chest, pleading against the skin of his neck for him to just take you home. Hoseok&rsquo;s resolve, at that very moment, breaks upon seeing you so scared. You feel him nod, and don&rsquo;t even care to address the flip of your stomach as shades of purple evade your vision and your suddenly back home, Tae whining against your hip as you fight to catch your fleeting breath. Hoseok, in a flurry of worry, holds you at arms length to look you over, and grimaces at the state in which your arm resides. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; He curses, pushing you softly so you fall into the sofa behind you before he&rsquo;s racing off just as another cloud of smoke fills the living room and Jungkook and Jimin return. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/n!&rdquo; Jungkook shrieks, dropping to his knees before you in a heartbeat to meet your weary gaze that flickered. &ldquo;What happened? Did Eleeze get away? Did he do this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He knew who I was Jungkook.&rdquo; You blandly announce and all three frames go rigid as Hoseok had reappeared with the medical kit, sitting by you with steel like actions. &ldquo;He knew about Tae, he knew about this!&rdquo; You raise your covered hand in a gesture of anger. &ldquo;And&hellip;he knew what I was going to say&hellip;before I had even said it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How are you so sure?&rdquo; Jimin questions, trying to keep a level head even though there&rsquo;s a light of giddiness in his eyes. A demon will always be a demon. You purse your lips, flinching away from the witches touch ever so slightly as he began to wrap and cover the wounded area of your arm which felt incredibly heavy and useless. You bite your lip, reluctant to tell them, but you know that they need to know. </p><p>&ldquo;I was going to blow my cover, I wanted to get out of there. There was something about him that was just so captivatingly scary, and I was ready to buck it when he voiced my exact same thoughts, and even said Jungkook name&hellip;&rdquo; You heave a breath, nodding your thanks to Hoseok as he ties the bandage off around your arm. &ldquo;I thought it was just a fluke&hellip;but then it happened again, only this time, with Hoseok&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;So, he can read minds?&rdquo; Jungkook questions with a scrunched nose and blazing eyes. Jimin shakes his head, arms folded across his chest as he looks you over. &ldquo;Something doesn&rsquo;t sound right, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like he was just reading her mind.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, we have to report back to Seokjin about all of this. He&rsquo;ll probably stamp this assignment as an on-going case now because clearly it&rsquo;s deeper than we thought.&rdquo; He stands to his feet, cracking his back with a sated sigh. &ldquo;You should get some rest Y/n, it&rsquo;s been a long night. Same goes for you two, okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Stay the night Hobi?&rdquo; Jungkook offers, and the witch seems to ponder on it for only a moment before nodding with a tired smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay, but tomorrow we all go to explain everything to Seokjin, alright? He&rsquo;s going to need to know, something isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; </p><p>You sink further into the sofa cushions, Tae curled at your side and acting as a heat pack as his throaty rumbled purrs seemed to rock you semi unconscious. The last thing you remember, is you mumbling something faint. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll catch him&hellip;I swear.</i>&rdquo; </p>",

However, an assignment was an assignment and nothing- and I mean nothing- would stop you from perfecting your clean score. Jimin had been a star in helping you out visually after hearing of yours and Jungkook\u2019s newest task, rooting carelessly through your wardrobe to brandish a more than eye catching piece. Demons apparently had a thing for musky colours and leather according to what the incubus had told you, and that much was clear from the black, leather pants squeezing your legs and the rouge brallete which you wanted nothing more than to cover. The demon had slipped an ankle flattering pair of heels onto your feet and dolled you all up just before Jungkook could announce that you had to head out, pronto. </p><p>He had done a double take the moment you shuffled miserably out from your bedroom, mumbling something about a 'damn cl\u00edche trope\u2019 under your breath as Jimin emerged after you, a look of pride evident on his face that Jungkook fed into with a sheepish compliment. Tae was already sat at the door, eager to leave with Hoseok by his side who watched the canine skeptically but happily stroked through his fur. A compliment slips the witches lips and whilst Jimin\u2019s ego inflates once more, you on the other hand shrink in on yourself, whispering a shy 'thanks\u2019 which evoked a pearly grin from Hoseok. \u201cJiminie I think you\u2019ve done God\u2019s work.\u201d Jungkook whistles lowly, shrugging on his black bomber jacket whilst swiftly handing you a miniscule ear piece which you applied instantly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was a female under all that slob.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear to God,\u201d You run your bandaged hand through you hair, evoking a whine of irritation from the incubus which halts your movement. Oh yeah, right. Your hair was\u2026styled\u2026for once. \u201cI will staple your dick to the wall.\u201d Jungkook blanches at your words, hands moving as subtly as they could to protect his 'precious jewels\u2019 all the while you rolled your eyes and bowed your head in thanks to Hoseok as he helped you pull your jacket on. \u201cAll ready?\u201d The witch asks, looking over the three of you whilst one of his hands rested atop of Tae\u2019s head. </p><p>\u201cReady to be leered at, molested and possibly groped? Sure.\u201d You fake enthusiasm, missing the sympathetic looks they all send you as Hoseok takes your hand and a purple puff of smoke swallows you both up as well as Tae, only to deposit you seconds later directly outside the <i>Purgatory</i>. Two other frames drop by and maroon smoke clears to reveal Jungkook and Jimin. Your stomach coils, and the Incubus already expects it. \u201cPlease don\u2019t throw up. I spent a lot of time on you and I don\u2019t want your incapacity to hold down your lunch after fast flashing to ruin it all.\u201d </p><p>Fast flashing. It was something all supernatural beings could do, and you hated it. You really did. </p><p>You throw him a heated glare and salute him with your middle finger, hunched over as you heaved through the feeling that gripped at your insides. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but not all of us can be naturally accustomed to travelling faster than the recorded speed of light.\u201d Jungkook moves to press at the skin of your stomach which the brallete leaves exposed, his cold hands (which he constantly had) cooling you down in an instant as the pads of his fingers skimmed across your skin and left goosebumps in their wake. \u201cBetter?\u201d He inquires softly with an incline of his head. You nod, straightening your posture and flashing a smile filled with gratitude his way. \u201cYeah,\u201d you roll your shoulders back and crack your neck to the side with a heavy, reluctant sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d Ducking your way into the club, warped lights twist before your very eyes and distinctive bodies are hard to be made out as everything seems to bleed together.

However, an assignment was an assignment and nothing- and I mean nothing- would stop you from perfecting your clean score. Jimin had been a star in helping you out visually after hearing of yours and Jungkook\u2019s newest task, rooting carelessly through your wardrobe to brandish a more than eye catching piece. Demons apparently had a thing for musky colours and leather according to what the incubus had told you, and that much was clear from the black, leather pants squeezing your legs and the rouge brallete which you wanted nothing more than to cover. The demon had slipped an ankle flattering pair of heels onto your feet and dolled you all up just before Jungkook could announce that you had to head out, pronto. </p><p>He had done a double take the moment you shuffled miserably out from your bedroom, mumbling something about a 'damn cl\u00edche trope\u2019 under your breath as Jimin emerged after you, a look of pride evident on his face that Jungkook fed into with a sheepish compliment. Tae was already sat at the door, eager to leave with Hoseok by his side who watched the canine skeptically but happily stroked through his fur. A compliment slips the witches lips and whilst Jimin\u2019s ego inflates once more, you on the other hand shrink in on yourself, whispering a shy 'thanks\u2019 which evoked a pearly grin from Hoseok. \u201cJiminie I think you\u2019ve done God\u2019s work.\u201d Jungkook whistles lowly, shrugging on his black bomber jacket whilst swiftly handing you a miniscule ear piece which you applied instantly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there was a female under all that slob.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI swear to God,\u201d You run your bandaged hand through you hair, evoking a whine of irritation from the incubus which halts your movement. Oh yeah, right. Your hair was\u2026styled\u2026for once. \u201cI will staple your dick to the wall.\u201d Jungkook blanches at your words, hands moving as subtly as they could to protect his 'precious jewels\u2019 all the while you rolled your eyes and bowed your head in thanks to Hoseok as he helped you pull your jacket on. \u201cAll ready?\u201d The witch asks, looking over the three of you whilst one of his hands rested atop of Tae\u2019s head. </p><p>\u201cReady to be leered at, molested and possibly groped? Sure.\u201d You fake enthusiasm, missing the sympathetic looks they all send you as Hoseok takes your hand and a purple puff of smoke swallows you both up as well as Tae, only to deposit you seconds later directly outside the <i>Purgatory</i>. Two other frames drop by and maroon smoke clears to reveal Jungkook and Jimin. Your stomach coils, and the Incubus already expects it. \u201cPlease don\u2019t throw up. I spent a lot of time on you and I don\u2019t want your incapacity to hold down your lunch after fast flashing to ruin it all.\u201d </p><p>Fast flashing. It was something all supernatural beings could do, and you hated it. You really did. </p><p>You throw him a heated glare and salute him with your middle finger, hunched over as you heaved through the feeling that gripped at your insides. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry, but not all of us can be naturally accustomed to travelling faster than the recorded speed of light.\u201d Jungkook moves to press at the skin of your stomach which the brallete leaves exposed, his cold hands (which he constantly had) cooling you down in an instant as the pads of his fingers skimmed across your skin and left goosebumps in their wake. \u201cBetter?\u201d He inquires softly with an incline of his head. You nod, straightening your posture and flashing a smile filled with gratitude his way. \u201cYeah,\u201d you roll your shoulders back and crack your neck to the side with a heavy, reluctant sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d Ducking your way into the club, warped lights twist before your very eyes and distinctive bodies are hard to be made out as everything seems to bleed together. You don\u2019t shy away from the electric atmosphere though, not once, because this is isn\u2019t your first rodeo. The group disperse in a heartbeat, Jimin finds a flock of bodies to entice and with him he takes a flustered Jungkook. Hoseok awkwardly moves off to a booth with Tae at his heels, which leaves you to sit forlornly at the bar, beckoning the bartender over with an incline of your head. The burning liquid in the shot glass slides down your throat in a heartbeat, and in fascination, you eye the black, pointed stumps which protrude from the side of the tenders head. A demon, clearly. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, he confirms it all by flashing you a black eyed wink after catching you openly checking him out. He\u2019s about to lean across the oaken bar top, no doubt with the intention to somehow get on your good side, however, the abrupt introduction of a new presence is noticed by both you and him as you look to your side and spot a lanky male seated besides you, dressed mostly in black. </p><p>\u201cEleeze! Good to see you man!\u201d The horned demon exclaims happily, a wide grin spread across his face as Eleeze bowed his head back in greeting, mumbling a coy 'good to see you too Damion\u2019 under his breath. Thankfully, both demons are too caught up to pick up on the way you stiffen and choke on your own breath. You\u2019re about to call the demon for another shot when it seems Eleeze beats you to it. \u201cA shot of whiskey.\u201d He demands, and Damion puckers his lips before turning away to fetch the requested drink. Meanwhile, you can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what has you so terribly frozen with fear, limbs like lead and head swarming as a cold sweat began on your palms, skin clammy and flushed with apprehension. You think desperately about blowing your cover just to escape the uneasy feeling which holds you captive, and the words swim clearly around your mind, but\u2026it isn\u2019t you who says them. </p><p>His voice is like nails dragging specifically across glass, eliciting a shudder up your spine, and your best friends name on his tongue sounds even more sinister. The mere act of it seeming to send a catapult straight through you stomach, and ah, there you go again, sick to your stomach once more. \u201c<i>Jungkook, I don\u2019t feel good. Something doesn\u2019t feel right.</i>\u201d You breath quickens, the seat which you were sitting on, now strewn across the floor under the sheer impact of how quickly you stood. The sudden movement garners the wary, watchful gazes of your teammates but they make no move to intercept just yet. You breath tremors, and Eleeze hasn\u2019t even looked at you yet, hasn\u2019t <i>even</i> bothered to acknowledge you until your making a heated attempt to escape and his bony hand is snatching up your wrist in the blink of an eye. The demon whirls you around, black eyes meeting the wavering orbs of your own and he glances down, <i>only</i> for a second, to scan the bandages wrapped around your hand. A malicious smirk splits his thinly, cracked lips. \u201c Looks like he was the right man for the job after all.\u201d He darkly muses, the words pulling tightly at your throat as all you wish to do right now is scream. The motion seems to ultimately get stuck though, just like how the rest of your body remains. Paralysed, beneath his intentful gaze. \u201cSuch a shame that I lost him to that mutt of yours. Nevermind though! I have you here now, and that\u2019s all that matters\u2026right?\u201d </p><p>You shift you gaze over to where you can faintly make out Hoseok\u2019s form in the booth, his name resting just on the tip of your tongue. However, once more, he beats you to it. \u201c<i>Hoseok, help me!</i>\u201d Eleeze manages to mock your very words, and you can\u2019t understand why as fanged teeth are cruelly presented behind thinly stretched lips. \u201cNow!\u201d He chimes. \u201cAre you going to come willingly?\u201d He flashes you a smile. \u201cOr am I going to have to do this the hard way?\u201d He narrows his eyes threateningly.  </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you mumble, the familiar sensation of fight or flight beginning to bubble heatedly in the lower pits of your stomach. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t stick around long enough to choose.\u201d He frowns, and in turn you attempt to spin out of his grasp, momentum twisting Eleeze\u2019s own body to face the bar where you slam his face against the oak whilst hissing through the sharp, fiery feeling which engulfs your upper arm. Jumping back from the demons frame, you hold your hand to your throbbing arm and pull it back to find it glistening red as Eleeze flashes you a glistening knife which is stained only the slightest. \u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you one way or another Y/n! Just watch!\u201d Is all he cackles, deflated against the oaken top as you allowed the dancing crowd to swallow you up, looking for the first familiar face you could stumble across. Hoseok catches you before you stumble pathetically to the ground, noting the tears stuck stubbornly to the ends of your lashes and the blatant trembling of your lip. The witch frantically calls your name, determined to find out what\u2019s wrong but all you can do is crumble against his chest, pleading against the skin of his neck for him to just take you home. Hoseok\u2019s resolve, at that very moment, breaks upon seeing you so scared. You feel him nod, and don\u2019t even care to address the flip of your stomach as shades of purple evade your vision and your suddenly back home, Tae whining against your hip as you fight to catch your fleeting breath. Hoseok, in a flurry of worry, holds you at arms length to look you over, and grimaces at the state in which your arm resides. \u201cShit.\u201d He curses, pushing you softly so you fall into the sofa behind you before he\u2019s racing off just as another cloud of smoke fills the living room and Jungkook and Jimin return. </p><p>\u201cY/n!\u201d Jungkook shrieks, dropping to his knees before you in a heartbeat to meet your weary gaze that flickered. \u201cWhat happened? Did Eleeze get away? Did he do this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe knew who I was Jungkook.\u201d You blandly announce and all three frames go rigid as Hoseok had reappeared with the medical kit, sitting by you with steel like actions. \u201cHe knew about Tae, he knew about this!\u201d You raise your covered hand in a gesture of anger. \u201cAnd\u2026he knew what I was going to say\u2026before I had even said it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow are you so sure?\u201d Jimin questions, trying to keep a level head even though there\u2019s a light of giddiness in his eyes. A demon will always be a demon. You purse your lips, flinching away from the witches touch ever so slightly as he began to wrap and cover the wounded area of your arm which felt incredibly heavy and useless. You bite your lip, reluctant to tell them, but you know that they need to know. </p><p>\u201cI was going to blow my cover, I wanted to get out of there. There was something about him that was just so captivatingly scary, and I was ready to buck it when he voiced my exact same thoughts, and even said Jungkook name\u2026\u201d You heave a breath, nodding your thanks to Hoseok as he ties the bandage off around your arm. \u201cI thought it was just a fluke\u2026but then it happened again, only this time, with Hoseok\u2019s name.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSo, he can read minds?\u201d Jungkook questions with a scrunched nose and blazing eyes. Jimin shakes his head, arms folded across his chest as he looks you over. \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t sound right, it doesn\u2019t sound like he was just reading her mind.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnyway, we have to report back to Seokjin about all of this. He\u2019ll probably stamp this assignment as an on-going case now because clearly it\u2019s deeper than we thought.\u201d He stands to his feet, cracking his back with a sated sigh. \u201cYou should get some rest Y/n, it\u2019s been a long night. Same goes for you two, okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cStay the night Hobi?\u201d Jungkook offers, and the witch seems to ponder on it for only a moment before nodding with a tired smile. </p><p>\u201cOkay, but tomorrow we all go to explain everything to Seokjin, alright? He\u2019s going to need to know, something isn\u2019t right.\u201d </p><p>You sink further into the sofa cushions, Tae curled at your side and acting as a heat pack as his throaty rumbled purrs seemed to rock you semi unconscious. The last thing you remember, is you mumbling something faint. </p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ll catch him\u2026I swear.</i>\u201d </p>",
