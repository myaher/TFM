Every few years an angel is born in heaven and they\u2019re taught for at least twenty years on things they are suppose to know: history, rules, skills, powers, etc. Every angel has a human counterpart that they are suppose to watch over and protect also known as a guardian angel. The angel\u2019s job is to watch over their human. They are not allowed to reveal themselves to their human and especially not to fall in love with them. Falling in love with a human was forbidden due to the different species and how a human could corrupt and cause an angel do things that they were against heaven\u2019s rules.</p><p>An angel that has been tainted, their pure white feathered wings would start turning black. Depending on how long the angel has been tainted, they may or may not be able to be purified. If there are more black feathers than white then all the angel can do is slow down his or her corruption. If there is more white then it is possible to purify the angel. Fully tainted angels are kicked from heaven and down to hell where they begin the painful process of having their body\u2019s reconstructed and changed to fit hell\u2019s nature causing them to become a demon.</p><p>Demons can be recognized by their slightly pointed ears, fangs, and their eyes would occasionally flash red, gold or blue depending on age. Young demons are red, middle aged are gold, while elders had piercing blue eyes. It\u2019s rare to find an elder due to the fact they prefer not leaving their homes in hell. Age doesn\u2019t mean another demon is stronger meaning a young demon could be stronger than a middle age or elder demon and still have red eyes. Their eyes flash their ages\u2019 color when the are experiencing strong emotions. Most demons tend to stay in their half demon form, which usually consists of leathery demonic wings, a long pointed tail, and slightly elongated nails. Demons can shift into a human form and walk on earth if they wish as a \u2018human\u2019 but they would be easily be discovered by an angel or very spiritual person due to their demonic aura. Their strong sense of smell and hearing occasionally is a weakness against strong scents and loud noises.</p><p>Angels are much harder to distinguish without their white wings and unnatural and pure look to them while in their angel form. Those their most distinguishable feature would be their eyes, which are usually warm, loving, and filled with life. Some male angels tend to have feminine features like legs, waist, face, etc. Despite that demons, on the other hand, can notice an angel by just their scent which either has a fruity or flowery scent mixed with something else that usually irritates most demons. One reason why demons dislike angels is usually an angel\u2019s scent is overbearing depending on how strong the angel is. Another reason is that both species were polar opposites of each other, naturewise.</p><p>Despite their differences, very rarely an angel and demon would be friends or even more than that. Rarely because demons can get a power boost if they manage to kill and absorb the power of an angel through their blood. (Though it is possible to gain power through an angel by drinking their blood, they chose to kill said angel since angels would rather fight to the death than be used as a power source). When it comes down to an angel and a demon in a relationship, demons care a little bit but in the end, angels care more about it. To them the worse kind of relationship an angel could be in with a demon is a homosexual one since it went against their law. Even homosexual angels keep quiet about their own relationships since the fact they\u2019re with the same sex, they are slowly but surely tainting themselves meaning they have to regularly cleanse themselves to keep their wings white.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The first time the old dark haired demon laid eyes on the little blond angel was more than fifty years ago. It was more along the lines of an accident in all honesty. He didn\u2019t plan on coming in contact with an angel let along a newly created fledgling fresh out of God\u2019s making. He was just roaming down the streets of the red light district in the human world looking for something to entertain him. It didn\u2019t matter to him what entertained him. Sex with men or women, gambling, drinking, murder. It was all the same to him. If it did then he would have to find new ways of keeping himself busy when he didn\u2019t have to devour a human soul or complete some pathetic \u00a0contract with trash.</p><p>That\u2019s all humans were to him. Food or trash. Those he made contracts with were both. Exasperation and annoyance towards the one who summoned him to do some heinous crime for them yet possessing some twisted form of amusement. Exasperation and annoyance towards the reason why he was summoned and amusement knowing that their expression will be entertaining to see while he turns on them and kills them when he is done. That\u2019s what he got done doing when he came across the little angel. He finished a job. Killed some retarded bastard human who \u2018ordered\u2019 him to kill the woman who cheated on him with another man. Silly human. He didn\u2019t think it through when he chose to summon a demon of his caliber. No human did. Honestly. Fools. All of them really\u2026but at least he had fun making the man scream in pain. Though his fun ran out when the human died and his soul was devoured. No matter. He always managed to find his entertainment.</p><p>And entertainment he found\u2026albeit surrounded by human filth that was attempting to drag his newly found entertainment off somewhere. It was probably to a whore house. He didn\u2019t know that the entertainment was a fledgling due to the it\u2019s small, weak and pure presence. The old demon would have honestly ignored the fledgling until he caught it\u2019s scent. It was an exotic combination. Vanilla\u2026with a hint of lavender and purity he guessed. It wasn\u2019t very strong, but his well trained and sensitive nose could pick up among the filth around them. His dark eyes went straight to where the fledgling was before moving over in that direction. It was a casual action. Casual enough for him to be ignored by the trash and for his hand to spear right through the male trash\u2019s back. His pale hand gripped the human\u2019s heart and ripped it out with little to no hesitation. The now deceased human\u2019s partners attempted to leave, but with a spear composed of darkness through their chest was enough to leave the trash where they were.</p><p>The demon inhaled slowly and deeply through his nose while his eyes slid shut. The coppery smell of blood\u2026 It was such a beautiful scent. The additional scent of angel was even better. It made him wonder what the fledgling\u2019s blood would smell like. His eyes opened to reveal piercing, icy blue orbs that focused intently on the terrified baby angel. He calmly removed his arm from the human\u2019s chest allowing the body to hit the ground before taking a couple of steps towards the newborn angel until he was directly in front of the small thing.</p><p>The dark haired demon squatted down in front of the young angel and stared with his unnatural blue cat shaped eyes. He took in the other\u2019s appearance with an impassive expression. The fledgling had fluffy and soft looking hair, which was a pale blond color. It probably was as soft as it looked if he knew better. He was small; childlike and delicate like if the demon decided to hit the child across the face using barely an eighth of his power, he could damage him beyond repair. The angel\u2019s skin was smooth, pale and unmarred except for that crimson that splattered on the poor thing\u2019s face. It was a rather beautiful sight in his opinion- seeing him covered in blood even if it was only slightly. What was an even more beautiful sight was the fledgling\u2019s eyes. They were such a breathtaking shade of lavender, but filled with fear and horror. It\u2019s how he usually liked seeing it especially in pain in the ass angels, but this fledgling rubbed him the wrong way.</p><p>The demon exhaled slowly before blinking once allowing his eyes to fade back to a dark brown almost black color. No need to terrify this newborn for now. \u201dOi\u2026 Little angel. What are you doing so far away from home? Babies like you shouldn\u2019t be down here. It\u2019s not safe. You could get hurt\u2026or worse killed.\u201d To calm the angel down, he reached out with his clean hand and placed it on the soft and fluffy hair (Ah ha! He was right! It was soft!) before gently stroking his hair in a reassuring manner. God dammit\u2026 If any demon sees him act like this towards the fledgling then he\u2019s killing them violently. \u201dI\u2019m Yoongi. What\u2019s your name, fledgling? Do you know your name or did your fall from grace hurt you more than expected?\u201d Yoongi questioned softly in a reassuring manner, which was abnormal for the demon or any demon in general towards an angel of all things.

Every few years an angel is born in heaven and they\u2019re taught for at least twenty years on things they are suppose to know: history, rules, skills, powers, etc. Every angel has a human counterpart that they are suppose to watch over and protect also known as a guardian angel. The angel\u2019s job is to watch over their human. They are not allowed to reveal themselves to their human and especially not to fall in love with them. Falling in love with a human was forbidden due to the different species and how a human could corrupt and cause an angel do things that they were against heaven\u2019s rules.</p><p>An angel that has been tainted, their pure white feathered wings would start turning black. Depending on how long the angel has been tainted, they may or may not be able to be purified. If there are more black feathers than white then all the angel can do is slow down his or her corruption. If there is more white then it is possible to purify the angel. Fully tainted angels are kicked from heaven and down to hell where they begin the painful process of having their body\u2019s reconstructed and changed to fit hell\u2019s nature causing them to become a demon.</p><p>Demons can be recognized by their slightly pointed ears, fangs, and their eyes would occasionally flash red, gold or blue depending on age. Young demons are red, middle aged are gold, while elders had piercing blue eyes. It\u2019s rare to find an elder due to the fact they prefer not leaving their homes in hell. Age doesn\u2019t mean another demon is stronger meaning a young demon could be stronger than a middle age or elder demon and still have red eyes. Their eyes flash their ages\u2019 color when the are experiencing strong emotions. Most demons tend to stay in their half demon form, which usually consists of leathery demonic wings, a long pointed tail, and slightly elongated nails. Demons can shift into a human form and walk on earth if they wish as a \u2018human\u2019 but they would be easily be discovered by an angel or very spiritual person due to their demonic aura. Their strong sense of smell and hearing occasionally is a weakness against strong scents and loud noises.</p><p>Angels are much harder to distinguish without their white wings and unnatural and pure look to them while in their angel form. Those their most distinguishable feature would be their eyes, which are usually warm, loving, and filled with life. Some male angels tend to have feminine features like legs, waist, face, etc. Despite that demons, on the other hand, can notice an angel by just their scent which either has a fruity or flowery scent mixed with something else that usually irritates most demons. One reason why demons dislike angels is usually an angel\u2019s scent is overbearing depending on how strong the angel is. Another reason is that both species were polar opposites of each other, naturewise.</p><p>Despite their differences, very rarely an angel and demon would be friends or even more than that. Rarely because demons can get a power boost if they manage to kill and absorb the power of an angel through their blood. (Though it is possible to gain power through an angel by drinking their blood, they chose to kill said angel since angels would rather fight to the death than be used as a power source). When it comes down to an angel and a demon in a relationship, demons care a little bit but in the end, angels care more about it. To them the worse kind of relationship an angel could be in with a demon is a homosexual one since it went against their law. Even homosexual angels keep quiet about their own relationships since the fact they\u2019re with the same sex, they are slowly but surely tainting themselves meaning they have to regularly cleanse themselves to keep their wings white.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The first time the old dark haired demon laid eyes on the little blond angel was more than fifty years ago. It was more along the lines of an accident in all honesty. He didn\u2019t plan on coming in contact with an angel let along a newly created fledgling fresh out of God\u2019s making. He was just roaming down the streets of the red light district in the human world looking for something to entertain him. It didn\u2019t matter to him what entertained him. Sex with men or women, gambling, drinking, murder. It was all the same to him. If it did then he would have to find new ways of keeping himself busy when he didn\u2019t have to devour a human soul or complete some pathetic \u00a0contract with trash.</p><p>That\u2019s all humans were to him. Food or trash. Those he made contracts with were both. Exasperation and annoyance towards the one who summoned him to do some heinous crime for them yet possessing some twisted form of amusement. Exasperation and annoyance towards the reason why he was summoned and amusement knowing that their expression will be entertaining to see while he turns on them and kills them when he is done. That\u2019s what he got done doing when he came across the little angel. He finished a job. Killed some retarded bastard human who \u2018ordered\u2019 him to kill the woman who cheated on him with another man. Silly human. He didn\u2019t think it through when he chose to summon a demon of his caliber. No human did. Honestly. Fools. All of them really\u2026but at least he had fun making the man scream in pain. Though his fun ran out when the human died and his soul was devoured. No matter. He always managed to find his entertainment.</p><p>And entertainment he found\u2026albeit surrounded by human filth that was attempting to drag his newly found entertainment off somewhere. It was probably to a whore house. He didn\u2019t know that the entertainment was a fledgling due to the it\u2019s small, weak and pure presence. The old demon would have honestly ignored the fledgling until he caught it\u2019s scent. It was an exotic combination. Vanilla\u2026with a hint of lavender and purity he guessed. It wasn\u2019t very strong, but his well trained and sensitive nose could pick up among the filth around them. His dark eyes went straight to where the fledgling was before moving over in that direction. It was a casual action. Casual enough for him to be ignored by the trash and for his hand to spear right through the male trash\u2019s back. His pale hand gripped the human\u2019s heart and ripped it out with little to no hesitation. The now deceased human\u2019s partners attempted to leave, but with a spear composed of darkness through their chest was enough to leave the trash where they were.</p><p>The demon inhaled slowly and deeply through his nose while his eyes slid shut. The coppery smell of blood\u2026 It was such a beautiful scent. The additional scent of angel was even better. It made him wonder what the fledgling\u2019s blood would smell like. His eyes opened to reveal piercing, icy blue orbs that focused intently on the terrified baby angel. He calmly removed his arm from the human\u2019s chest allowing the body to hit the ground before taking a couple of steps towards the newborn angel until he was directly in front of the small thing.</p><p>The dark haired demon squatted down in front of the young angel and stared with his unnatural blue cat shaped eyes. He took in the other\u2019s appearance with an impassive expression. The fledgling had fluffy and soft looking hair, which was a pale blond color. It probably was as soft as it looked if he knew better. He was small; childlike and delicate like if the demon decided to hit the child across the face using barely an eighth of his power, he could damage him beyond repair. The angel\u2019s skin was smooth, pale and unmarred except for that crimson that splattered on the poor thing\u2019s face. It was a rather beautiful sight in his opinion- seeing him covered in blood even if it was only slightly. What was an even more beautiful sight was the fledgling\u2019s eyes. They were such a breathtaking shade of lavender, but filled with fear and horror. It\u2019s how he usually liked seeing it especially in pain in the ass angels, but this fledgling rubbed him the wrong way.</p><p>The demon exhaled slowly before blinking once allowing his eyes to fade back to a dark brown almost black color. No need to terrify this newborn for now. \u201dOi\u2026 Little angel. What are you doing so far away from home? Babies like you shouldn\u2019t be down here. It\u2019s not safe. You could get hurt\u2026or worse killed.\u201d To calm the angel down, he reached out with his clean hand and placed it on the soft and fluffy hair (Ah ha! He was right! It was soft!) before gently stroking his hair in a reassuring manner. God dammit\u2026 If any demon sees him act like this towards the fledgling then he\u2019s killing them violently. \u201dI\u2019m Yoongi. What\u2019s your name, fledgling? Do you know your name or did your fall from grace hurt you more than expected?\u201d Yoongi questioned softly in a reassuring manner, which was abnormal for the demon or any demon in general towards an angel of all things. He moved his hand downward to wipe the blood away from the unknown angel\u2019s cheek then onto the dark jeans he wore before placing his hand back on the other\u2019s head.</p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"748\" data-orig-height=\"1334\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/226ccfeae6fb065b8550c93fc93f5bcd/tumblr_inline_pgnjlaBeo61v2az8z_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"748\" data-orig-height=\"1334\"></figure></p>",

Exasperation and annoyance towards the reason why he was summoned and amusement knowing that their expression will be entertaining to see while he turns on them and kills them when he is done. That&rsquo;s what he got done doing when he came across the little angel. He finished a job. Killed some retarded bastard human who &lsquo;ordered&rsquo; him to kill the woman who cheated on him with another man. Silly human. He didn&rsquo;t think it through when he chose to summon a demon of his caliber. No human did. Honestly. Fools. All of them really&hellip;but at least he had fun making the man scream in pain. Though his fun ran out when the human died and his soul was devoured. No matter. He always managed to find his entertainment.</p><p>And entertainment he found&hellip;albeit surrounded by human filth that was attempting to drag his newly found entertainment off somewhere. It was probably to a whore house. He didn&rsquo;t know that the entertainment was a fledgling due to the it&rsquo;s small, weak and pure presence. The old demon would have honestly ignored the fledgling until he caught it&rsquo;s scent. It was an exotic combination. Vanilla&hellip;with a hint of lavender and purity he guessed. It wasn&rsquo;t very strong, but his well trained and sensitive nose could pick up among the filth around them. His dark eyes went straight to where the fledgling was before moving over in that direction. It was a casual action. Casual enough for him to be ignored by the trash and for his hand to spear right through the male trash&rsquo;s back. His pale hand gripped the human&rsquo;s heart and ripped it out with little to no hesitation. The now deceased human&rsquo;s partners attempted to leave, but with a spear composed of darkness through their chest was enough to leave the trash where they were.</p><p>The demon inhaled slowly and deeply through his nose while his eyes slid shut. The coppery smell of blood&hellip; It was such a beautiful scent. The additional scent of angel was even better. It made him wonder what the fledgling&rsquo;s blood would smell like. His eyes opened to reveal piercing, icy blue orbs that focused intently on the terrified baby angel. He calmly removed his arm from the human&rsquo;s chest allowing the body to hit the ground before taking a couple of steps towards the newborn angel until he was directly in front of the small thing.</p><p>The dark haired demon squatted down in front of the young angel and stared with his unnatural blue cat shaped eyes. He took in the other&rsquo;s appearance with an impassive expression. The fledgling had fluffy and soft looking hair, which was a pale blond color. It probably was as soft as it looked if he knew better. He was small; childlike and delicate like if the demon decided to hit the child across the face using barely an eighth of his power, he could damage him beyond repair. The angel&rsquo;s skin was smooth, pale and unmarred except for that crimson that splattered on the poor thing&rsquo;s face. It was a rather beautiful sight in his opinion- seeing him covered in blood even if it was only slightly. What was an even more beautiful sight was the fledgling&rsquo;s eyes. They were such a breathtaking shade of lavender, but filled with fear and horror. It&rsquo;s how he usually liked seeing it especially in pain in the ass angels, but this fledgling rubbed him the wrong way.</p><p>The demon exhaled slowly before blinking once allowing his eyes to fade back to a dark brown almost black color. No need to terrify this newborn for now. &rdquo;Oi&hellip; Little angel. What are you doing so far away from home? Babies like you shouldn&rsquo;t be down here. It&rsquo;s not safe. You could get hurt&hellip;or worse killed.&rdquo; To calm the angel down, he reached out with his clean hand and placed it on the soft and fluffy hair (Ah ha! He was right! It was soft!) before gently stroking his hair in a reassuring manner. God dammit&hellip; If any demon sees him act like this towards the fledgling then he&rsquo;s killing them violently. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m Yoongi. What&rsquo;s your name, fledgling? Do you know your name or did your fall from grace hurt you more than expected?&rdquo; Yoongi questioned softly in a reassuring manner, which was abnormal for the demon or any demon in general towards an angel of all things. He moved his hand downward to wipe the blood away from the unknown angel&rsquo;s cheek then onto the dark jeans he wore before placing his hand back on the other&rsquo;s head.</p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/226ccfeae6fb065b8550c93fc93f5bcd/tumblr_inline_pgnjlaBeo61v2az8z_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
