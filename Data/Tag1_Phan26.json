Everywhere Phil looked, he saw the photo. It was so blurry and grainy but it was obvious who it was and it was obvious what was happening. Every time he looked at the photo, he felt sicker and sicker.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe worst part was that he felt so powerless to everything. He felt absolutely powerless to anything that was happening and it was so far beyond their control. When he\u2019d gotten off from the phone with Dan, he\u2019d cried so hard that Spike barked at him and Phil had yelled for him to shut up and then immediately apologized. He\u2019d held Spike close. He knew his crying was unsettling for his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hadn\u2019t bothered to call his mum back or Martyn. He didn\u2019t even look at PJ\u2019s text. A part of him believes that if he stops looking at his phone and seeing the photo, he can believe the photo never existed and this entire thing wasn\u2019t happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was curled up on his bed when he heard Dan enter his flat a short time later. He could hear Dan\u2019s footsteps walk around before they eventually walked to the bedroom. Phil looked up at him and immediately broke down into tears again at Dan\u2019s puffy eyes and tear stained cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMarianne is talking with the media right now to try and get the photo pulled. I have my entire team working individually to find the source of the photo so we can press charges.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t solve our problem.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and wiping his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t anything we can do right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a long sigh. \u201cSo what are we going to do now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked into the bedroom further and shrugged his shoulders. He took a seat on the edge of Phil\u2019s bed and sniffled. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could release statements and ask for privacy but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really work when our privacy has already been breached.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI never really planned for this to ever happen.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI should have been more careful. I knew how paparazzi liked to follow me around and I knew that they would eventually find out where I was but I still should have been more careful. It was my fault for kissing you in such an open setting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil says. He actually believes\u2015no, knows this too. He knows that this isn\u2019t Dan\u2019s fault and he doesn\u2019t want Dan taking the blame for it. Not with all of this shit crumbling around them, he doesn\u2019t need Dan to take the fall.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut it is.\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt\u2019s indirectly my fault and you can\u2019t argue with it. I\u2019m the one who is the celebrity, not you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that isn\u2019t your fault for what the paparazzi are doing to you\u2015to us. They\u2019re ruining our privacy and breaching our boundaries.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd on top of that, I have that movie premiere tomorrow night and I\u2019m going to have to show up since it\u2019ll look fucked if I don\u2019t. And when I get there, I\u2019m going to bombarded by people and cameras and microphones and I\u2019m going to have to bite my tongue to not tell them to get fucked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is all such bullshit.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods again in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Dan asks him and it catches Phil off guard.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan lets out a watery sigh. \u201cI told Marianne that I would travel back to LA tomorrow night immediately following the premiere. I need to sort things out back home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil reached out and put his hand on Dan\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laid down on the bed and rolled closer to Phil, bringing their bodies closer together. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan\u2019s torso and pulled him close.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey just laid in silence together. In the background, Phil could hear both of their phones going off, constantly vibrating from emails, missed calls, and texts. But right now, they just lay together, crying silently as they think about the future and what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey were just outed in front of the entire world. Phil wasn\u2019t even out to some of his coworkers and past friends and now, his name is plastered on headlines as kissing Daniel Howell. He can only imagine what people must be thinking right now. He doesn\u2019t even want to see his social media. He doesn\u2019t want to see his Twitter or Instagram or even his YouTube channel.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhatever chance he had a normal life was just ripped away from him and he\u2019ll never get it back. He\u2019s always be known as the guy in the photo kissing Daniel Howell.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey remain silent until Dan suddenly begins to kiss him and they find themselves getting heated. Just mere moments later, Dan is beneath him, spreading his legs open and Phil is stretching him open and pushing inside not long after. It\u2019s a bit sad and Phil feels tears prick his eyes as he thrusts into Dan. But as his thrusting gets faster and Dan moans under him, he feels something deep and primal take over.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is the one thing they have between them that remains private. Sex will always be just for him and Dan to have. No one will be able to see Dan like Phil does. No one will see the way Dan shuts his eyes and bites his lip as he moans.

He drops his phone to the other side of the bed and curls onto his side as he pulls his knees up to his chest and lets go all fo the sadness from the last few days.\u00a0</p>",

Everywhere Phil looked, he saw the photo. It was so blurry and grainy but it was obvious who it was and it was obvious what was happening. Every time he looked at the photo, he felt sicker and sicker.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe worst part was that he felt so powerless to everything. He felt absolutely powerless to anything that was happening and it was so far beyond their control. When he\u2019d gotten off from the phone with Dan, he\u2019d cried so hard that Spike barked at him and Phil had yelled for him to shut up and then immediately apologized. He\u2019d held Spike close. He knew his crying was unsettling for his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hadn\u2019t bothered to call his mum back or Martyn. He didn\u2019t even look at PJ\u2019s text. A part of him believes that if he stops looking at his phone and seeing the photo, he can believe the photo never existed and this entire thing wasn\u2019t happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was curled up on his bed when he heard Dan enter his flat a short time later. He could hear Dan\u2019s footsteps walk around before they eventually walked to the bedroom. Phil looked up at him and immediately broke down into tears again at Dan\u2019s puffy eyes and tear stained cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMarianne is talking with the media right now to try and get the photo pulled. I have my entire team working individually to find the source of the photo so we can press charges.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t solve our problem.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and wiping his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t anything we can do right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a long sigh. \u201cSo what are we going to do now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked into the bedroom further and shrugged his shoulders. He took a seat on the edge of Phil\u2019s bed and sniffled. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could release statements and ask for privacy but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really work when our privacy has already been breached.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI never really planned for this to ever happen.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI should have been more careful. I knew how paparazzi liked to follow me around and I knew that they would eventually find out where I was but I still should have been more careful. It was my fault for kissing you in such an open setting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil says. He actually believes\u2015no, knows this too. He knows that this isn\u2019t Dan\u2019s fault and he doesn\u2019t want Dan taking the blame for it. Not with all of this shit crumbling around them, he doesn\u2019t need Dan to take the fall.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut it is.\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt\u2019s indirectly my fault and you can\u2019t argue with it. I\u2019m the one who is the celebrity, not you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that isn\u2019t your fault for what the paparazzi are doing to you\u2015to us. They\u2019re ruining our privacy and breaching our boundaries.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd on top of that, I have that movie premiere tomorrow night and I\u2019m going to have to show up since it\u2019ll look fucked if I don\u2019t. And when I get there, I\u2019m going to bombarded by people and cameras and microphones and I\u2019m going to have to bite my tongue to not tell them to get fucked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is all such bullshit.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods again in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Dan asks him and it catches Phil off guard.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan lets out a watery sigh. \u201cI told Marianne that I would travel back to LA tomorrow night immediately following the premiere. I need to sort things out back home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil reached out and put his hand on Dan\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laid down on the bed and rolled closer to Phil, bringing their bodies closer together. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan\u2019s torso and pulled him close.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey just laid in silence together. In the background, Phil could hear both of their phones going off, constantly vibrating from emails, missed calls, and texts. But right now, they just lay together, crying silently as they think about the future and what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey were just outed in front of the entire world. Phil wasn\u2019t even out to some of his coworkers and past friends and now, his name is plastered on headlines as kissing Daniel Howell. He can only imagine what people must be thinking right now. He doesn\u2019t even want to see his social media. He doesn\u2019t want to see his Twitter or Instagram or even his YouTube channel.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhatever chance he had a normal life was just ripped away from him and he\u2019ll never get it back. He\u2019s always be known as the guy in the photo kissing Daniel Howell.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey remain silent until Dan suddenly begins to kiss him and they find themselves getting heated. Just mere moments later, Dan is beneath him, spreading his legs open and Phil is stretching him open and pushing inside not long after. It\u2019s a bit sad and Phil feels tears prick his eyes as he thrusts into Dan. But as his thrusting gets faster and Dan moans under him, he feels something deep and primal take over.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is the one thing they have between them that remains private. Sex will always be just for him and Dan to have. No one will be able to see Dan like Phil does. No one will see the way Dan shuts his eyes and bites his lip as he moans. No one will see what Dan looks like naked underneath them.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is just for Phil to see from now on and forever and he intends to eventually make that clear.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan finishes before him but not long after, Phil pulls out and finishes on Dan\u2019s belly. It was what he needed to feel the stress leave his body and he can tell Dan feels the same way as his muscles unclench in his stomach and back. They don\u2019t even bother to clean up. They just lay down next to each other and fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil calls in sick to work the next morning and then before Phil can really comprehend what the day is actually going to bring, Dan tells him that he needs to leave so he can go and get ready all day for the premiere that night. Their goodbye is much more bittersweet than when Phil left Los Angeles. There isn\u2019t as many tears shed but it definitely hurts a lot more because Phil has no idea what the future is going to bring anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s lost.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s completely and utterly lost.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sees Dan out with one last kiss goodbye and then Dan leaves out the door to a black cab with his suitcase and he\u2019s gone once again out of Phil\u2019s life. Phil doesn\u2019t even know when he\u2019s going to see Dan again and maybe that\u2019s why this departure feels a lot more bittersweet.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis was supposed to be his and Dan\u2019s time to be together and it was ruined by the paparazzi and now they couldn\u2019t enjoy what they wanted to. Phil has to figure out what to do while Dan goes to a movie premiere and then flies back to Los Angeles to figure out what he is going to do.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sits on his couch all day and ignores all of the phone calls that come in. He sends his mum and brother texts asking for some time to himself and then he turns off his phone and leaves it be.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he gets onto his laptop, he finds himself looking through his old footage of videos that he and Dan had filmed when he was in LA. He clicks through the videos and finds one of him and Dan doing a Q+A that they had asked questions for and finds himself importing the footage into his editing software and splicing it together.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe works on that until its done and he honestly does not know how long it takes. He exports it and renders it and then he\u2019s on his YouTube channel. Phil\u2019s clicking on his profile and then he\u2019s clicking on upload and suddenly he\u2019s uploading the video and titling it. He adds in the description that this is the last video he\u2019ll post for a while and then as it uploads, he watches the progress bar rise further and further to 100%.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen it\u2019s finished, he presses publish and takes a deep breath before closing his laptop and tossing it gently to the floor and laying on his side.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe never sees what the reception of the video was.

Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it\u2019s hard to ignore the famous star.

Everywhere Phil looked, he saw the photo. It was so blurry and grainy but it was obvious who it was and it was obvious what was happening. Every time he looked at the photo, he felt sicker and sicker.\u00a0</p><p>\tThe worst part was that he felt so powerless to everything. He felt absolutely powerless to anything that was happening and it was so far beyond their control. When he\u2019d gotten off from the phone with Dan, he\u2019d cried so hard that Spike barked at him and Phil had yelled for him to shut up and then immediately apologized. He\u2019d held Spike close. He knew his crying was unsettling for his pup.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hadn\u2019t bothered to call his mum back or Martyn. He didn\u2019t even look at PJ\u2019s text. A part of him believes that if he stops looking at his phone and seeing the photo, he can believe the photo never existed and this entire thing wasn\u2019t happening.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe was curled up on his bed when he heard Dan enter his flat a short time later. He could hear Dan\u2019s footsteps walk around before they eventually walked to the bedroom. Phil looked up at him and immediately broke down into tears again at Dan\u2019s puffy eyes and tear stained cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cMarianne is talking with the media right now to try and get the photo pulled. I have my entire team working individually to find the source of the photo so we can press charges.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t solve our problem.\u201d Phil says, reaching up and wiping his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t anything we can do right now.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil let out a long sigh. \u201cSo what are we going to do now?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan walked into the bedroom further and shrugged his shoulders. He took a seat on the edge of Phil\u2019s bed and sniffled. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWe could release statements and ask for privacy but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really work when our privacy has already been breached.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI never really planned for this to ever happen.\u201d Dan says. \u201cI should have been more careful. I knew how paparazzi liked to follow me around and I knew that they would eventually find out where I was but I still should have been more careful. It was my fault for kissing you in such an open setting.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Phil says. He actually believes\u2015no, knows this too. He knows that this isn\u2019t Dan\u2019s fault and he doesn\u2019t want Dan taking the blame for it. Not with all of this shit crumbling around them, he doesn\u2019t need Dan to take the fall.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut it is.\u201d Dan says. \u201cIt\u2019s indirectly my fault and you can\u2019t argue with it. I\u2019m the one who is the celebrity, not you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cBut that isn\u2019t your fault for what the paparazzi are doing to you\u2015to us. They\u2019re ruining our privacy and breaching our boundaries.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI know.\u201d Dan says. \u201cAnd on top of that, I have that movie premiere tomorrow night and I\u2019m going to have to show up since it\u2019ll look fucked if I don\u2019t. And when I get there, I\u2019m going to bombarded by people and cameras and microphones and I\u2019m going to have to bite my tongue to not tell them to get fucked.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cThis is all such bullshit.\u201d Phil says.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan nods again in agreement.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Dan asks him and it catches Phil off guard.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan lets out a watery sigh. \u201cI told Marianne that I would travel back to LA tomorrow night immediately following the premiere. I need to sort things out back home.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil reached out and put his hand on Dan\u2019s arm. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan laid down on the bed and rolled closer to Phil, bringing their bodies closer together. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan\u2019s torso and pulled him close.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey just laid in silence together. In the background, Phil could hear both of their phones going off, constantly vibrating from emails, missed calls, and texts. But right now, they just lay together, crying silently as they think about the future and what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey were just outed in front of the entire world. Phil wasn\u2019t even out to some of his coworkers and past friends and now, his name is plastered on headlines as kissing Daniel Howell. He can only imagine what people must be thinking right now. He doesn\u2019t even want to see his social media. He doesn\u2019t want to see his Twitter or Instagram or even his YouTube channel.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhatever chance he had a normal life was just ripped away from him and he\u2019ll never get it back. He\u2019s always be known as the guy in the photo kissing Daniel Howell.\u00a0</p><p>\tThey remain silent until Dan suddenly begins to kiss him and they find themselves getting heated. Just mere moments later, Dan is beneath him, spreading his legs open and Phil is stretching him open and pushing inside not long after. It\u2019s a bit sad and Phil feels tears prick his eyes as he thrusts into Dan. But as his thrusting gets faster and Dan moans under him, he feels something deep and primal take over.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is the one thing they have between them that remains private. Sex will always be just for him and Dan to have. No one will be able to see Dan like Phil does. No one will see the way Dan shuts his eyes and bites his lip as he moans. No one will see what Dan looks like naked underneath them.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis is just for Phil to see from now on and forever and he intends to eventually make that clear.\u00a0</p><p>\tDan finishes before him but not long after, Phil pulls out and finishes on Dan\u2019s belly. It was what he needed to feel the stress leave his body and he can tell Dan feels the same way as his muscles unclench in his stomach and back. They don\u2019t even bother to clean up. They just lay down next to each other and fall asleep.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil calls in sick to work the next morning and then before Phil can really comprehend what the day is actually going to bring, Dan tells him that he needs to leave so he can go and get ready all day for the premiere that night. Their goodbye is much more bittersweet than when Phil left Los Angeles. There isn\u2019t as many tears shed but it definitely hurts a lot more because Phil has no idea what the future is going to bring anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s lost.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe\u2019s completely and utterly lost.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sees Dan out with one last kiss goodbye and then Dan leaves out the door to a black cab with his suitcase and he\u2019s gone once again out of Phil\u2019s life. Phil doesn\u2019t even know when he\u2019s going to see Dan again and maybe that\u2019s why this departure feels a lot more bittersweet.\u00a0</p><p>\tThis was supposed to be his and Dan\u2019s time to be together and it was ruined by the paparazzi and now they couldn\u2019t enjoy what they wanted to. Phil has to figure out what to do while Dan goes to a movie premiere and then flies back to Los Angeles to figure out what he is going to do.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe sits on his couch all day and ignores all of the phone calls that come in. He sends his mum and brother texts asking for some time to himself and then he turns off his phone and leaves it be.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen he gets onto his laptop, he finds himself looking through his old footage of videos that he and Dan had filmed when he was in LA. He clicks through the videos and finds one of him and Dan doing a Q+A that they had asked questions for and finds himself importing the footage into his editing software and splicing it together.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe works on that until its done and he honestly does not know how long it takes. He exports it and renders it and then he\u2019s on his YouTube channel. Phil\u2019s clicking on his profile and then he\u2019s clicking on upload and suddenly he\u2019s uploading the video and titling it. He adds in the description that this is the last video he\u2019ll post for a while and then as it uploads, he watches the progress bar rise further and further to 100%.\u00a0</p><p>\tWhen it\u2019s finished, he presses publish and takes a deep breath before closing his laptop and tossing it gently to the floor and laying on his side.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe never sees what the reception of the video was. He never sees anyones reaction. He doesn\u2019t even see what Dan says about the video because by the time he finally turns his phone on, the premiere for the moving is beginning and he\u2019s watching it on his telly.\u00a0</p><p>\tSpike lays with him and they watch the TV as the hosts of the entertainment channel he stumbled upon talk about how it\u2019s going to be a star studded night for the occasion and they were going to be covering some of the celebrities who were showing up to the red carpet.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watches curiously as all of the celebrities begin to arrive for the premiere and then suddenly a limo pulls ups and he see Dan step out with the help of a bodyguard. Phil watches with a tight throat as he sees all of the flashing lights flaring at Dan. He\u2019s wearing a black pin stripe blazer with black pants and Phil thinks he looks stunning and he\u2019s upset that he didn\u2019t get the chance to tell Dan that himself.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cDaniel Howell has just arrived to the red carpet.\u201d The one host says on the TV. \u201cHe\u2019s been the center of media headlines over the last couple weeks and there were talks that his appearance tonight would be up in the air.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tThe host suddenly walks over to Dan and Phil can see the fear that is registering over his face as the host points the microphone at him. \u201cHello, Dan! Do you care to tell us who you\u2019re wearing tonight?\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cI\u2019m wearing Marc Jacobs.\u201d Dan says with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cOoh.\u201d She says. \u201cWe were all surprised to see you at the premiere tonight following the massive media attention in the last 24 hours.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil watches Dan\u2019s smile falter and Phil wants to go through the screen and shake the host and scream at her that she shouldn\u2019t be asking Dan that. But instead, he has to sit back and watch as Dan visibly recoils and then tries to answer.\u00a0</p><p>\t\u201cWell, my friends all worked hard on this film and I\u2019d been an extra on the set so it only feels right that I still come out and support them on such a great occasion.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\tDan then turns away from the host and walks away and the host tries to play it off like that was what was supposed to happen and she turns back to the camera to speak about how Chris Hemsworth was arriving right about now to the red carpet.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil reaches for the remote and flips the channel, finding a cooking show to watch instead as the bile rises in his throat.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil gets around to calling his mum before he goes to bed that night and he shares a\u00a0 healthy cry with her over the phone. His mum keeps him calm and tells him that she\u2019s spoken to someone to act as a publicist on his behalf and this time, Phil doesn\u2019t argue with her about it. He needs the help.\u00a0</p><p>\tHe hears from Dan when he leaves the premiere and heads for the airport and when he falls asleep that night, he\u2019s convinced that Dan is on his flight back to Los Angeles.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil wakes up from a restless sleep to his phone buzzing repeatedly on his night stand. He reaches for it and checks it and sees that is Dan wanting to Facetime. He looks at the time and notes that it is a little after 6am which means Dan is back in the USA by now.\u00a0</p><p>\tPhil answers it and Dan\u2019s face pops up on the screen in front of him.

Working in the advertising department, he was content being alongside his friend and fellow coworker PJ during every shift. However, the BBC is temporarily being used as a film set for a new movie staring Hollywood &lsquo;It&rsquo; star, Daniel Howell. Being stuck as an extra on the set, Phil finds it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the famous star. And maybe, just maybe, Dan finds it hard to ignore Phil as well.<br /></p><p><b>Word Count</b>: 2.6k (this chapter)</p><p><b>Warnings</b>: Occasional swearing and sexual content&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rating</b>: Explicit </p><p><b>Updates will be every Sunday around 1pm EST</b></p><p><b>**<a href=\"https://yiffandquiff.tumblr.com/iwantitfic\" target=\"_blank\">MASTERLIST</a> | <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/17481176/chapters/45210964\" target=\"_blank\">READ ON AO3</a> | <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.w.tt%2FwRz3waENjV&amp;t=NGFjYWY1NzMyNWI3MDZiOGYwM2JiYzVhNzJkZWY4MTliMGUzYWQ5ZCx0a2VnbklQRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Aj-hMZ5Lp9HeXbc-IdwveRg&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fyiffandquiff.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F183680620282%2Fi-want-it-i-got-it-chapter-16&amp;m=1\" target=\"_blank\">WATTPAD</a>**</b></p><p>\tThe picture was spread over every corner of the world. Everywhere Phil looked, he saw the photo. It was so blurry and grainy but it was obvious who it was and it was obvious what was happening. Every time he looked at the photo, he felt sicker and sicker.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe worst part was that he felt so powerless to everything. He felt absolutely powerless to anything that was happening and it was so far beyond their control. When he&rsquo;d gotten off from the phone with Dan, he&rsquo;d cried so hard that Spike barked at him and Phil had yelled for him to shut up and then immediately apologized. He&rsquo;d held Spike close. He knew his crying was unsettling for his pup.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe hadn&rsquo;t bothered to call his mum back or Martyn. He didn&rsquo;t even look at PJ&rsquo;s text. A part of him believes that if he stops looking at his phone and seeing the photo, he can believe the photo never existed and this entire thing wasn&rsquo;t happening.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe was curled up on his bed when he heard Dan enter his flat a short time later. He could hear Dan&rsquo;s footsteps walk around before they eventually walked to the bedroom. Phil looked up at him and immediately broke down into tears again at Dan&rsquo;s puffy eyes and tear stained cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Marianne is talking with the media right now to try and get the photo pulled. I have my entire team working individually to find the source of the photo so we can press charges.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t solve our problem.&rdquo; Phil says, reaching up and wiping his cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t anything we can do right now.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil let out a long sigh. &ldquo;So what are we going to do now?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan walked into the bedroom further and shrugged his shoulders. He took a seat on the edge of Phil&rsquo;s bed and sniffled. &ldquo;I actually don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We could release statements and ask for privacy but&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t really work when our privacy has already been breached.&rdquo; Phil says.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods in agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I never really planned for this to ever happen.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I should have been more careful. I knew how paparazzi liked to follow me around and I knew that they would eventually find out where I was but I still should have been more careful. It was my fault for kissing you in such an open setting.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault.&rdquo; Phil says. He actually believes&#8213;no, knows this too. He knows that this isn&rsquo;t Dan&rsquo;s fault and he doesn&rsquo;t want Dan taking the blame for it. Not with all of this shit crumbling around them, he doesn&rsquo;t need Dan to take the fall.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But it is.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s indirectly my fault and you can&rsquo;t argue with it. I&rsquo;m the one who is the celebrity, not you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t your fault for what the paparazzi are doing to you&#8213;to us. They&rsquo;re ruining our privacy and breaching our boundaries.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;And on top of that, I have that movie premiere tomorrow night and I&rsquo;m going to have to show up since it&rsquo;ll look fucked if I don&rsquo;t. And when I get there, I&rsquo;m going to bombarded by people and cameras and microphones and I&rsquo;m going to have to bite my tongue to not tell them to get fucked.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This is all such bullshit.&rdquo; Phil says.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan nods again in agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo; Dan asks him and it catches Phil off guard.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan lets out a watery sigh. &ldquo;I told Marianne that I would travel back to LA tomorrow night immediately following the premiere. I need to sort things out back home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil reached out and put his hand on Dan&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan laid down on the bed and rolled closer to Phil, bringing their bodies closer together. Phil wrapped his arms around Dan&rsquo;s torso and pulled him close.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey just laid in silence together. In the background, Phil could hear both of their phones going off, constantly vibrating from emails, missed calls, and texts. But right now, they just lay together, crying silently as they think about the future and what&rsquo;s going to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey were just outed in front of the entire world. Phil wasn&rsquo;t even out to some of his coworkers and past friends and now, his name is plastered on headlines as kissing Daniel Howell. He can only imagine what people must be thinking right now. He doesn&rsquo;t even want to see his social media. He doesn&rsquo;t want to see his Twitter or Instagram or even his YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhatever chance he had a normal life was just ripped away from him and he&rsquo;ll never get it back. He&rsquo;s always be known as the guy in the photo kissing Daniel Howell.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThey remain silent until Dan suddenly begins to kiss him and they find themselves getting heated. Just mere moments later, Dan is beneath him, spreading his legs open and Phil is stretching him open and pushing inside not long after. It&rsquo;s a bit sad and Phil feels tears prick his eyes as he thrusts into Dan. But as his thrusting gets faster and Dan moans under him, he feels something deep and primal take over.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThis is the one thing they have between them that remains private. Sex will always be just for him and Dan to have. No one will be able to see Dan like Phil does. No one will see the way Dan shuts his eyes and bites his lip as he moans. No one will see what Dan looks like naked underneath them.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThis is just for Phil to see from now on and forever and he intends to eventually make that clear.&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan finishes before him but not long after, Phil pulls out and finishes on Dan&rsquo;s belly. It was what he needed to feel the stress leave his body and he can tell Dan feels the same way as his muscles unclench in his stomach and back. They don&rsquo;t even bother to clean up. They just lay down next to each other and fall asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil calls in sick to work the next morning and then before Phil can really comprehend what the day is actually going to bring, Dan tells him that he needs to leave so he can go and get ready all day for the premiere that night. Their goodbye is much more bittersweet than when Phil left Los Angeles. There isn&rsquo;t as many tears shed but it definitely hurts a lot more because Phil has no idea what the future is going to bring anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s lost.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe&rsquo;s completely and utterly lost.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sees Dan out with one last kiss goodbye and then Dan leaves out the door to a black cab with his suitcase and he&rsquo;s gone once again out of Phil&rsquo;s life. Phil doesn&rsquo;t even know when he&rsquo;s going to see Dan again and maybe that&rsquo;s why this departure feels a lot more bittersweet.&nbsp;</p><p>\tThis was supposed to be his and Dan&rsquo;s time to be together and it was ruined by the paparazzi and now they couldn&rsquo;t enjoy what they wanted to. Phil has to figure out what to do while Dan goes to a movie premiere and then flies back to Los Angeles to figure out what he is going to do.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe sits on his couch all day and ignores all of the phone calls that come in. He sends his mum and brother texts asking for some time to himself and then he turns off his phone and leaves it be.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen he gets onto his laptop, he finds himself looking through his old footage of videos that he and Dan had filmed when he was in LA. He clicks through the videos and finds one of him and Dan doing a Q+A that they had asked questions for and finds himself importing the footage into his editing software and splicing it together.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe works on that until its done and he honestly does not know how long it takes. He exports it and renders it and then he&rsquo;s on his YouTube channel. Phil&rsquo;s clicking on his profile and then he&rsquo;s clicking on upload and suddenly he&rsquo;s uploading the video and titling it. He adds in the description that this is the last video he&rsquo;ll post for a while and then as it uploads, he watches the progress bar rise further and further to 100%.&nbsp;</p><p>\tWhen it&rsquo;s finished, he presses publish and takes a deep breath before closing his laptop and tossing it gently to the floor and laying on his side.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe never sees what the reception of the video was. He never sees anyones reaction. He doesn&rsquo;t even see what Dan says about the video because by the time he finally turns his phone on, the premiere for the moving is beginning and he&rsquo;s watching it on his telly.&nbsp;</p><p>\tSpike lays with him and they watch the TV as the hosts of the entertainment channel he stumbled upon talk about how it&rsquo;s going to be a star studded night for the occasion and they were going to be covering some of the celebrities who were showing up to the red carpet.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watches curiously as all of the celebrities begin to arrive for the premiere and then suddenly a limo pulls ups and he see Dan step out with the help of a bodyguard. Phil watches with a tight throat as he sees all of the flashing lights flaring at Dan. He&rsquo;s wearing a black pin stripe blazer with black pants and Phil thinks he looks stunning and he&rsquo;s upset that he didn&rsquo;t get the chance to tell Dan that himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Daniel Howell has just arrived to the red carpet.&rdquo; The one host says on the TV. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been the center of media headlines over the last couple weeks and there were talks that his appearance tonight would be up in the air.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tThe host suddenly walks over to Dan and Phil can see the fear that is registering over his face as the host points the microphone at him. &ldquo;Hello, Dan! Do you care to tell us who you&rsquo;re wearing tonight?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wearing Marc Jacobs.&rdquo; Dan says with a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Ooh.&rdquo; She says. &ldquo;We were all surprised to see you at the premiere tonight following the massive media attention in the last 24 hours.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil watches Dan&rsquo;s smile falter and Phil wants to go through the screen and shake the host and scream at her that she shouldn&rsquo;t be asking Dan that. But instead, he has to sit back and watch as Dan visibly recoils and then tries to answer.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Well, my friends all worked hard on this film and I&rsquo;d been an extra on the set so it only feels right that I still come out and support them on such a great occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tDan then turns away from the host and walks away and the host tries to play it off like that was what was supposed to happen and she turns back to the camera to speak about how Chris Hemsworth was arriving right about now to the red carpet.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil reaches for the remote and flips the channel, finding a cooking show to watch instead as the bile rises in his throat.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>\tPhil gets around to calling his mum before he goes to bed that night and he shares a&nbsp; healthy cry with her over the phone. His mum keeps him calm and tells him that she&rsquo;s spoken to someone to act as a publicist on his behalf and this time, Phil doesn&rsquo;t argue with her about it. He needs the help.&nbsp;</p><p>\tHe hears from Dan when he leaves the premiere and heads for the airport and when he falls asleep that night, he&rsquo;s convinced that Dan is on his flight back to Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil wakes up from a restless sleep to his phone buzzing repeatedly on his night stand. He reaches for it and checks it and sees that is Dan wanting to Facetime. He looks at the time and notes that it is a little after 6am which means Dan is back in the USA by now.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil answers it and Dan&rsquo;s face pops up on the screen in front of him. His eyes are puffy and his cheeks red and Phil knows that there is something different&#8213;more tense&#8213;hanging in the air as Dan opens his mouth to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;We need to talk, Phil.&rdquo; He begins.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Phil chokes out.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;i&rsquo;ve been doing some thinking and&hellip;&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice breaks. &ldquo;I think we should take a break.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil feels his heart shatter as if someone just took a sledgehammer to glass but he tries his best to hide it despite his vision blurring.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this.&rdquo; Dan says, his voice continuing to break as he speaks. &ldquo;But I think it&rsquo;s for the best if we take the time apart to let this situation clear and then we can try again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a break up.&rdquo; Dan reassures. &ldquo;This is just a break, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Can you please say something else?&rdquo; Dan pleaded.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I think a break is a good thing too.&rdquo; Phil lies.&nbsp;\t</p><p>\t&ldquo;Are you&hellip;are you sure that&rsquo;s how you feel?&rdquo; Dan asks.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil nods, a tear suddenly sliding down his cheek and landing on his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Fuck, this is so much harder than I wanted it to be.&rdquo; Dan says, his voice hoarse.&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil can see that he&rsquo;s crying silently to himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s best too if we try and remain as low as we can about each other.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I think we shouldn&rsquo;t try to contact each other for the next few days and we should just try and let this situation be pushed on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil turns his head and tries to hide the fact that a sob is threatening to break through his mouth. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t easy for me, Phil.&rdquo; Dan says. &ldquo;I love you so damn much, okay and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this.&rdquo; Dan sniffles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just until we can figure out what we can do in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\tPhil just nods and pulls his lips into a tight line as he looks at the screen through a clouded gaze. Dan brings his hand up and wipes off his face.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want it to come to this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;Me either.&rdquo; Phil says.&nbsp;</p><p>\t&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just until the media blows over.

He drops his phone to the other side of the bed and curls onto his side as he pulls his knees up to his chest and lets go all fo the sadness from the last few days.&nbsp;</p>",
