One of the tallest people I&rsquo;d ever seen walked in, brushing his quiff against the doorframe as he ducked to make it inside. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi! How can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>This guy literally radiated sunshine, and his eyes seemed to capture everything in a childlike excitement. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, I love your shop. I was hoping you could help me out with a cake. I&rsquo;ve gone to 2 shops already and none of them wanted to help.&rdquo;</p><p>I quirked an eyebrow up as I wondered what this man could possibly want that 2 other shops couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t do. </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks! I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. What did you have in mind?&rdquo;</p><p>He listed out that he wanted a rainbow layer cake, with baby blue icing and a rainbow on the top with clouds. What he wanted underneath in writing was &ldquo;Big D&rsquo;s Big B&rdquo;. It made me remember a man who came in last year, and as I looked at the man in front of me he began to look vaguely familiar. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I can do that. It&rsquo;s certainly not the weirdest thing I&rsquo;ve put on a cake. I had a guy come in last year wanting &quot;show me your birthday philussy&rdquo; on his. I&rsquo;ll never forget making that one. Explaining it to my co-&hellip;why are you looking at me like that?&ldquo;</p><p>The man was gaping at me and his eyes were beginning  to crinkle as he laughed. </p><p>&quot;What? What&rsquo;d I miss?&rdquo;</p><p>As he finished laughing he threw his head back and then told me, &ldquo;That cake was for me, it was my birthday. I had one hell of a time explaining it to my parents.&rdquo;</p><p>Instantly, I placed his face. &ldquo;Oh my god! Phil! Dan showed me a picture of who the cake was for and when you walked in I knew I&rsquo;d seen you from somewhere!&rdquo;</p><p>We both laughed for a moment before I had to continue putting the order in. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing this is revenge for the philussy cake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; He said, popping the &lsquo;p&rsquo;, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rainbow because he just came out and it&rsquo;s his birthday, and I wanted to get him something special.&rdquo;</p><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p><p>Just like Dan, Phil showed up about 20 minutes after I called him, paid for the cake and as I hit 'print receipt&rsquo; I asked, &ldquo;Hey I know this is a weird request but do you have a picture of Dan? I&rsquo;d like to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil smiled, lighting up the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Sure, one sec.&rdquo;</p><p>A moment later he pulled up a picture of Dan grinning at something, or someone, off camera with a deep dimple in his cheek and his eyes bright. </p><p>Phil chuckled and told me that their fans had named the dimple Derek, and when I looked up at him in confusion he told me they were youtubers. </p><p>I grinned and then pulled the receipt out. &ldquo;Tell him congratulations and happy birthday for me please.&rdquo;</p><p>He grinned, told me he would and walked out, the bell protesting as the door closed behind him, and he walked up the street. </p>",
