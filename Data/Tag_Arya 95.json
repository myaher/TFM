And anyone who calls it character assassination is <b><i>wrong!</i></b></p><p>Here is a list of reasons in no particular order:</p><ul><li>The season 7 Winterfell plot is bad, but I think with some tweaking it could have worked. However! Most people base Sansa being power hungry on Arya&rsquo;s impressions and on the scripts. Arya thinks Sansa is power hungry (based on old impressions) and the scripts show what the audience needs to see, but it&rsquo;s also clear from context that Sansa is not that (e.g. Defending Jon&rsquo;s rule and immediately trying to give Winterfell to Bran, quite sincerely) I think a lot of plotting was done off camera and that was not great.
