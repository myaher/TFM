And if Natasha taught you anything over all your years with the Avengers, it was that you must find a weakness and go with it. You were doing your job, and you were pretty damn good at it. That doesn\u2019t mean Carol hated it any less. And even though you\u2019re only across the ballroom, she refuses to look. She doesn\u2019t think she can stand it.

She tried to tune back in to the conversation and actually do her job. She hears the target, the prime minister, speak of an address, which means you\u2019ve successfully completed the mission. Carol can\u2019t help but feel a wave of pride for her world-class spy of a girlfriend. She jots the address down in her communicator to repeat it to Tony and others who were awaiting the news.</p><p>She can\u2019t stop herself from then glancing across the room at you, and the sight she sees makes her blood boil. The man you\u2019d been coercing into submission is getting a little too handsy for your and Carol\u2019s comfort. His hand was low on your back and he was leaning into you, speaking into your ear. Carol gulps, and pretends like she wasn\u2019t staring when you begin to walk towards her. She notices the way you walk in confidence back to her. </p><p>She looks down shyly, and remembers how silly she feels in her dress. A silky lavender color, you helped her style it on your way to the location. She was never one to partake in elegance of that level, but she thought you looked stunning in yours. Even though she\u2019s still a little fuming from the encounter, she feels a grin blooming when you take your hand in yours and head for the exit.</p><p>When you finally arrive back at the compound, the first thing Carol does is kick off her heels and flop on her bed. She\u2019s thinking of you, as usual, but this time it\u2019s not as dream-like as normal. Now she can\u2019t shake the vision of you getting cozy with someone else in a crowded ballroom. <i>It was for the mission</i>, she tells herself. But that doesn\u2019t help to ease her in any way. </p><p>She\u2019s examining her reflection in the mirror, still clad in the dress that looked far too expensive to abandon on the floor. She hears a knock on her door, and assume it\u2019s Tony congratulating her on a successful mission and inviting her to celebrate. She opens it, and sees you. Her heart nearly stops at the sight from the unexpectedness. Her breath hitches when you smile and slip passed her into the room. Carol doesn\u2019t know it, but you\u2019re thinking the same of her. Her hair seemed to fall especially meticulously and the small bit of lipstick she\u2019d applied made all the difference. You take notice of her figure in the purple dress as well. You wonder if you\u2019d looked that good in your red one, which has since been exchanged for shorts and a tee shirt. </p><p>Without words, you collapse on the bed with a sigh. Carol sits on the edge. You can tell something is <i>off</i> when she faces away from you, flipping through a book she hadn\u2019t read in weeks. You don\u2019t know what to say, but you try to make conversation anyway. \u201cThat prime minister guy is a total <i>creep</i>.\u201d</p><p>Carol looks up, and speaks without thinking. \u201cYou seemed to quite enjoy it, actually.\u201d She mutters under her breath. She can\u2019t control the animosity that is ever-present in her voice.</p><p>Your face contorts into confused disgust. \u201cSeriously? No, I wanted to get the address and leave as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Carol shifts uncomfortably in her seat, getting up and slipping the straps of the dress off her shoulders without a word. You take her silence as all you need to confirm that she was quite bitter about the whole thing. You sigh, letting your hang low. You look up again, and Carol has shedded the dress completely, and you watch as it pools around her feet. You gulp at the sight. No matter how many times you\u2019d seen her in such a state, it never failed to leave you speechless.</p><p>She walks to her wardrobe, throwing on a tee shirt and jacket with some jeans. Her back still to you, you swing your legs over the edge of the bed and walk over to her. She feels your hand on her back and turns to look at you. She\u2019s got a bit of a defeated look on her face that breaks your heart. Carol forces herself to face you completely then, and you brush a strand of her blonde hair out of her face. \u201cCarol,\u201d you speak lowly, crossing your arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You phrase it like a question, but it\u2019s more of a demand for answers.</p><p>Her eyes flicker up to yours and she sighs, letting them flutter shut for a moment. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019m not used to seeing you with someone else like that. I didn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s all.\u201d Her voice nearly breaks at the end of her sentence. \u201cHated it, actually.\u201d</p><p>You try to conceal a laugh, but it escapes through your lips. You hold her face in your hand, and she leans into your touch. You kiss her, and it\u2019s warm and familiar and all you could ever ask for. Carol feels like all the energy and life she possessed was put back into her. You pull away and she almost pouts. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true, right?\u201d You aks, and you\u2019re so close to her it comes out as a whisper.</p><p>She runs a hand down your side and settles it on your waist. She finds herself yearning for your touch, your undivided attention, and just <i>you</i>. Always you.</p><p>Carol nods, but if it\u2019s not confirmation enough she speaks it out loud. \u201cYes. But you know I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she pauses to lean into you again, and the distance between your bodies diminishes. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like sharing.\u201d \u00a0She can feel your breath on her neck as you plant open-mouth kisses on all the exposed skin you can find. The feeling is ethereal, and Carol\u2019s knees feel weak. You\u2019re an angel and she <i>loves you.</i></p><p>God, she loves you.</p><p>She can feel you tugging at the hem of her shirt, and suddenly you\u2019re up against the wall, Carol towering over you. She\u2019s trying not to whimper between kissing you. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know already,\u201d you mutter in-between hungry kisses to her neck, jawline, collarbone, \u201cYou\u2019re all I want. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s hand slips up your shirt and her hands are warm against your abdomen. She stops for just a moment to look you in the eyes. You\u2019re so beautiful in the dim lighting of her room she thinks she might collapse at the sheer image. \u201cSwear?\u201d</p><p>You smirk. \u201cI\u2019m all yours, Captain.\u201d</p><p>She feels like she might cry at those four words, the sight of you against the wall, lips just slightly puffy from where she\u2019d shown her how much she loved you. She hums against your neck, and the vibration causes you to erupt into a soft giggle.</p><p>Yeah, she really, <i>really</i> loves you.</p>",

No, I wanted to get the address and leave as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Carol shifts uncomfortably in her seat, getting up and slipping the straps of the dress off her shoulders without a word. You take her silence as all you need to confirm that she was quite bitter about the whole thing. You sigh, letting your hang low. You look up again, and Carol has shedded the dress completely, and you watch as it pools around her feet. You gulp at the sight. No matter how many times you\u2019d seen her in such a state, it never failed to leave you speechless.</p><p>She walks to her wardrobe, throwing on a tee shirt and jacket with some jeans. Her back still to you, you swing your legs over the edge of the bed and walk over to her. She feels your hand on her back and turns to look at you. She\u2019s got a bit of a defeated look on her face that breaks your heart. Carol forces herself to face you completely then, and you brush a strand of her blonde hair out of her face. \u201cCarol,\u201d you speak lowly, crossing your arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You phrase it like a question, but it\u2019s more of a demand for answers.</p><p>Her eyes flicker up to yours and she sighs, letting them flutter shut for a moment. \u201cI just\u2026 I\u2019m not used to seeing you with someone else like that. I didn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s all.\u201d Her voice nearly breaks at the end of her sentence. \u201cHated it, actually.\u201d</p><p>You try to conceal a laugh, but it escapes through your lips. You hold her face in your hand, and she leans into your touch. You kiss her, and it\u2019s warm and familiar and all you could ever ask for. Carol feels like all the energy and life she possessed was put back into her. You pull away and she almost pouts. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true, right?\u201d You aks, and you\u2019re so close to her it comes out as a whisper.</p><p>She runs a hand down your side and settles it on your waist. She finds herself yearning for your touch, your undivided attention, and just <i>you</i>. Always you.</p><p>Carol nods, but if it\u2019s not confirmation enough she speaks it out loud. \u201cYes. But you know I can\u2019t help it,\u201d she pauses to lean into you again, and the distance between your bodies diminishes. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like sharing.\u201d \u00a0She can feel your breath on her neck as you plant open-mouth kisses on all the exposed skin you can find. The feeling is ethereal, and Carol\u2019s knees feel weak. You\u2019re an angel and she <i>loves you.</i></p><p>God, she loves you.</p><p>She can feel you tugging at the hem of her shirt, and suddenly you\u2019re up against the wall, Carol towering over you. She\u2019s trying not to whimper between kissing you. </p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know already,\u201d you mutter in-between hungry kisses to her neck, jawline, collarbone, \u201cYou\u2019re all I want. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s hand slips up your shirt and her hands are warm against your abdomen. She stops for just a moment to look you in the eyes. You\u2019re so beautiful in the dim lighting of her room she thinks she might collapse at the sheer image. \u201cSwear?\u201d</p><p>You smirk. \u201cI\u2019m all yours, Captain.\u201d</p><p>She feels like she might cry at those four words, the sight of you against the wall, lips just slightly puffy from where she\u2019d shown her how much she loved you. She hums against your neck, and the vibration causes you to erupt into a soft giggle.</p><p>Yeah, she really, <i>really</i> loves you.</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>all yours, captain | carol danvers</h1><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p><b>summary</b>: carol can get&hellip; what&rsquo;s the word, a little <i>possessive</i> at times. she can&rsquo;t help it, you simply mean to much to her. she decides to show you just how much that could be. also carol is soft.</p><p><b>pairing</b>: carol danvers x fem!reader</p><p><b>words</b>: 1.3K</p><p><b>a/n</b>: listen. hear me out. this was not supposed to get smutty, but it does nonetheless. nothing too graphic, but be aware of that. i love carol. bye.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you look like a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Says the third glass of whiskey you&rsquo;re sipping like it&rsquo;s water.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol grits her teeth. She can hear it all through the earpiece you and her were both wearing. Flirting with the target to get information was a classic tactic, the perfect way to go for a particularly naive individual. And if Natasha taught you anything over all your years with the Avengers, it was that you must find a weakness and go with it. You were doing your job, and you were pretty damn good at it. That doesn&rsquo;t mean Carol hated it any less. And even though you&rsquo;re only across the ballroom, she refuses to look. She doesn&rsquo;t think she can stand it. The person you&rsquo;re subconsciously controlling might as well be her.</p><p>&ldquo;Danvers,&rdquo; she hears Tony&rsquo;s voice snap in her ear. &ldquo;You got eyes on Y/N and the prime minister?&rdquo;</p><p>She takes a long sip of seltzer water in her flute glass before deciding to answer. &ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p><p>Static follows. She tried to tune back in to the conversation and actually do her job. She hears the target, the prime minister, speak of an address, which means you&rsquo;ve successfully completed the mission. Carol can&rsquo;t help but feel a wave of pride for her world-class spy of a girlfriend. She jots the address down in her communicator to repeat it to Tony and others who were awaiting the news.</p><p>She can&rsquo;t stop herself from then glancing across the room at you, and the sight she sees makes her blood boil. The man you&rsquo;d been coercing into submission is getting a little too handsy for your and Carol&rsquo;s comfort. His hand was low on your back and he was leaning into you, speaking into your ear. Carol gulps, and pretends like she wasn&rsquo;t staring when you begin to walk towards her. She notices the way you walk in confidence back to her. </p><p>She looks down shyly, and remembers how silly she feels in her dress. A silky lavender color, you helped her style it on your way to the location. She was never one to partake in elegance of that level, but she thought you looked stunning in yours. Even though she&rsquo;s still a little fuming from the encounter, she feels a grin blooming when you take your hand in yours and head for the exit.</p><p>When you finally arrive back at the compound, the first thing Carol does is kick off her heels and flop on her bed. She&rsquo;s thinking of you, as usual, but this time it&rsquo;s not as dream-like as normal. Now she can&rsquo;t shake the vision of you getting cozy with someone else in a crowded ballroom. <i>It was for the mission</i>, she tells herself. But that doesn&rsquo;t help to ease her in any way. </p><p>She&rsquo;s examining her reflection in the mirror, still clad in the dress that looked far too expensive to abandon on the floor. She hears a knock on her door, and assume it&rsquo;s Tony congratulating her on a successful mission and inviting her to celebrate. She opens it, and sees you. Her heart nearly stops at the sight from the unexpectedness. Her breath hitches when you smile and slip passed her into the room. Carol doesn&rsquo;t know it, but you&rsquo;re thinking the same of her. Her hair seemed to fall especially meticulously and the small bit of lipstick she&rsquo;d applied made all the difference. You take notice of her figure in the purple dress as well. You wonder if you&rsquo;d looked that good in your red one, which has since been exchanged for shorts and a tee shirt. </p><p>Without words, you collapse on the bed with a sigh. Carol sits on the edge. You can tell something is <i>off</i> when she faces away from you, flipping through a book she hadn&rsquo;t read in weeks. You don&rsquo;t know what to say, but you try to make conversation anyway. &ldquo;That prime minister guy is a total <i>creep</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol looks up, and speaks without thinking. &ldquo;You seemed to quite enjoy it, actually.&rdquo; She mutters under her breath. She can&rsquo;t control the animosity that is ever-present in her voice.</p><p>Your face contorts into confused disgust. &ldquo;Seriously?
