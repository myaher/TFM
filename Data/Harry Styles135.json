(Before they are together) I love your writing!!!",
        "answer": "<p><b>Thank you and you\u2019re welcome!</b></p><p>.</p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t the kind of guy who overused pet names to call anyone. The only girl he\u2019s ever called \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 before was his childhood best friend Olivia, whom he hasn\u2019t seen or heard from in years. But he grew up with her so she didn\u2019t really count. </p><p>That was before Y/N.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, <i>love</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey <i>love</i>, see you after class!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Love</i>, I\u2019m going out, need me to get you anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood night, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p>Harry calls his flatmate \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 so often that it\u2019s almost become her second name now. The first few times he called her \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 was just to tease her, knowing she hated him and thought he was annoying. But the closer they get, the more he grows to enjoy calling her so, probably because of the way she starts blushing every single time, and because she is now really <i>that</i> to him, his <i>love</i>.</p><p>Y/N used to hate it, that pet name, since she assumed he used it with every girl he knew and for sure didn\u2019t take it seriously. However, they\u2019ve been living together for quite a long time now and she\u2019s never once heard him call any other girl he\u2019s brought home by that name, and honestly, it makes Y/N feel kinda special.</p><p>It\u2019s an ordinary Wednesday afternoon in the library, Harry\u2019s tutoring Y/N for this class she\u2019s struggling with. They\u2019ve spent two hours on one topic as Harry keeps explaining over and over again but his flatmate has her head somewhere on the clouds. No matter how hard she tries, Y/N just can\u2019t concentrate, because, <i>1</i>) his eyes are extra green today and she can\u2019t explain why, she just has to stare, <i>2</i>) he\u2018s so sexy in his new shirt, yellow has never looked better on him.</p><p>\u201cFocus!\u201d Harry taps his pencil slightly on Y/N\u2019s forehead when he catches her smiling for no reason. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst student I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d</p><p>His comment makes her giggle. \u201cI\u2019m the only student you\u2019ve ever had, H.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Y/N speaks way too soon. Just as she finishes that sentence, Niall shows up, walking behind him is a beautiful red head. She\u2019s got the type of face that only one look at it can immediately crush your self-confidence to dust. Y/N thinks she\u2019s seen the girl in a few of her classes before, they\u2019ve never spoken to each other though.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend Carrie. Mind if she joins us?\u201d asks Niall, and Harry happily tells the girl to sit and that she\u2019s welcome here.</p><p>\u201cSorry love, you\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Harry whispers to Y/N with a smirk on his face. </p><p>She knows he means she\u2019s not his only <i>student</i> like she thought she was, but Y/N also understands it as she\u2019s not the only girl in his life and therefore she\u2019s not special. He didn\u2019t have to remind her of something she\u2019s already well aware of, the last thing she needs is another crack in the heart. <i>Thank you very much!</i></p><p>Niall and Carrie sit down in front of Harry and Y/N. Y/N doesn\u2019t like the way Carrie and Harry look at each other. It\u2019s like they\u2019re eye-fucking right here, in a library, with their friends in presence! <i>How inappropriate! </i>Moreover, this pretty girl showing up apparently makes Harry forget what he\u2019s <i>really</i> here for. He\u2019s gawking at Carrie now. Annoyed, Y/N taps her pencil on his forehead without warning, causing her flatmate to snap back to reality and shoot her a look of surprise. </p><p>\u201cFocus!\u201d She repeats what he said to her earlier, sounding slightly upset, though she doesn\u2019t think he can see it through.</p><p>.</p><p>Half an hour has passed and Y/N is getting more and more irritated. Carrie is not subtly flirting anymore. She always finds excuses to touch Harry\u2019s hand, toy with his pen and draw silly doodles on the corner of his notebook page, and he lets her!!! Y/N thinks the two of them are probably playing footsies under the desk right now; she\u2019s afraid to look knowing she\u2019d get mad (even though she doesn\u2019t really have the right to). Therefore, Y/N decides to just ignore everything and pays attention to her textbook instead.</p><p>It\u2019s Harry who pulls her trigger.</p><p>Carrie mentions something about the information in the book and asks him if what she understands is right, to which he replies by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s correct, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p><i>Love!!!</i></p><p>Y/N and Niall both turn to Harry the second they hear that word, while he\u2019s too busy taking note to notice the looks on their faces. </p><p>Y/N is <i>very</i> offended indeed! </p><p>Did he just call that girl \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019? He only calls <i>her</i> that. Even Niall knows it, since he appears just as shocked as Y/N is and even takes a glance at her to see her reaction. </p><p>Y/N is doubtlessly upset yet doesn\u2019t want to dramatize the whole situation, so she chooses to stay quiet. </p><p><i>It\u2019s just a stupid pet name, it doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2026</i>or at least that\u2019s what Y/N\u2019s trying to convince herself in order to feel better, which doesn\u2019t help, not even a little bit.</p><p>At the end of the afternoon, as they head back to the parking lot together alone, Y/N tries to avoid making eye contact with Harry at all costs. One look at him and she knows she\u2019ll explode. She\u2019s very mad and doesn\u2019t want to speak to him or hear him speak. Harry, being an oblivious dumbass, decides to start a conversation anyway.</p><p>\u201cLove, why are you so quiet?\u201d He questions as he walks faster in order to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she grumbles, which really catches him off guard.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you liked that nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do. It\u2019s cringy and annoying.\u201d That\u2019s a lie. She thinks Harry cannot tell she\u2019s lying but of course he can. He\u2019s better at being a liar than she\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He chuckles, lowering his head to look at her face but she turns it away from him, leaving him no choice but to poke her side. Y/N is <i>very</i> ticklish, and by doing so, Harry gets exactly the reaction he wants from her.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off!\u201d She slaps his hand away. \u201cGo do that to Carrie, she\u2019d sure like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, because you know what?\u201d She faces him with both hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> one of your girls, so stop calling me \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 like I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He chuckles with a faint look of confusion. \u201cI only call you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called Carrie that,\u201d Y/N says before she can stop herself.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sat right next to you. I heard it loud and clear. Niall did too!\u201d</p><p>As much as Harry loves the way she scrunches up her nose when she\u2019s mad, he doesn\u2019t like having her believe something that\u2019s not even close to the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve just slipped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s not lying right now. He doesn\u2019t even remember calling anyone beside her by that pet name. Maybe he thought it was Y/N who was talking to him, or he was thinking of her and called Carrie \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 by accident. But how is he gonna explain that to Y/N without it being \u2018<i>I\u2019m secretly in love with you, and you\u2019re always on my mind sometimes I can\u2019t think straight</i>\u2019?</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Carrie shows up all of a sudden and runs to catch up with Harry and Y/N. </p><p><i>Shit</i>, the last thing he needs is her being here!</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask.\u201d The red head smiles breathlessly when she stops in front of them. \u201cCan I have your number? Just to discuss course materials and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Harry knows that look, those lectures would be the <i>last</i> thing this girl wants to talk about. Harry must admit he thinks she\u2019s really pretty, he froze for a second or two when he first saw her in the library; and if they\u2019d met a couple months ago, he would\u2019ve been the one to ask for <i>her</i> number. </p><p>But Harry\u2019s changed. She isn\u2019t<i> his Y/N</i>, and he\u2019s promised himself not to do this anymore. </p><p><i>No girl other than Y/N.</i></p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He gives her a shrug. \u201cMy girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be happy if I gave another girl my phone number.\u201d</p><p>Carrie is taken aback for she\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s single. Niall told her that! Harry, on the other note, doesn\u2019t feel like explaining. He just grabs Y/N by the hand and says goodbye to the other girl right away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love.\u201d He turns to his flatmate. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d Y/N raises an eyebrow at him as they continue walking with him still holding her hand. \u201cWho\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2018I\u2019m taken</i>\u2019 is always a good way to tell someone you\u2019re not interested,\u201d he tells her with a silly grin on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought I called her \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019! I don\u2019t like her that way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Y/N can\u2019t help the smile on her face which has started to grow. \u201cYou like me\u2026<i>that</i> way?\u201d </p><p>The unexpected question turns Harry\u2019s body into stone right on the spot. If he looked at her right now he\u2019d get to see a vibrant beam which she\u2019s unable to hide; but Harry\u2019s too embarrassed to even take a quick glance at her after unintentionally letting those words escape.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, stop putting words in my mouth.\u201d Harry scoffs while shaking his head.</p><p>But Y/N is not disappointed, not at all.</p>",

Therefore, Y/N decides to just ignore everything and pays attention to her textbook instead.</p><p>It\u2019s Harry who pulls her trigger.</p><p>Carrie mentions something about the information in the book and asks him if what she understands is right, to which he replies by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s correct, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p><i>Love!!!</i></p><p>Y/N and Niall both turn to Harry the second they hear that word, while he\u2019s too busy taking note to notice the looks on their faces. </p><p>Y/N is <i>very</i> offended indeed! </p><p>Did he just call that girl \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019? He only calls <i>her</i> that. Even Niall knows it, since he appears just as shocked as Y/N is and even takes a glance at her to see her reaction. </p><p>Y/N is doubtlessly upset yet doesn\u2019t want to dramatize the whole situation, so she chooses to stay quiet. </p><p><i>It\u2019s just a stupid pet name, it doesn\u2019t mean anything\u2026</i>or at least that\u2019s what Y/N\u2019s trying to convince herself in order to feel better, which doesn\u2019t help, not even a little bit.</p><p>At the end of the afternoon, as they head back to the parking lot together alone, Y/N tries to avoid making eye contact with Harry at all costs. One look at him and she knows she\u2019ll explode. She\u2019s very mad and doesn\u2019t want to speak to him or hear him speak. Harry, being an oblivious dumbass, decides to start a conversation anyway.</p><p>\u201cLove, why are you so quiet?\u201d He questions as he walks faster in order to catch up with her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she grumbles, which really catches him off guard.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I thought you liked that nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do. It\u2019s cringy and annoying.\u201d That\u2019s a lie. She thinks Harry cannot tell she\u2019s lying but of course he can. He\u2019s better at being a liar than she\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He chuckles, lowering his head to look at her face but she turns it away from him, leaving him no choice but to poke her side. Y/N is <i>very</i> ticklish, and by doing so, Harry gets exactly the reaction he wants from her.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off!\u201d She slaps his hand away. \u201cGo do that to Carrie, she\u2019d sure like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, are you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, because you know what?\u201d She faces him with both hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m <i>not</i> one of your girls, so stop calling me \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 like I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He chuckles with a faint look of confusion. \u201cI only call you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called Carrie that,\u201d Y/N says before she can stop herself.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sat right next to you. I heard it loud and clear. Niall did too!\u201d</p><p>As much as Harry loves the way she scrunches up her nose when she\u2019s mad, he doesn\u2019t like having her believe something that\u2019s not even close to the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve just slipped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s not lying right now. He doesn\u2019t even remember calling anyone beside her by that pet name. Maybe he thought it was Y/N who was talking to him, or he was thinking of her and called Carrie \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 by accident. But how is he gonna explain that to Y/N without it being \u2018<i>I\u2019m secretly in love with you, and you\u2019re always on my mind sometimes I can\u2019t think straight</i>\u2019?</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Carrie shows up all of a sudden and runs to catch up with Harry and Y/N. </p><p><i>Shit</i>, the last thing he needs is her being here!</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask.\u201d The red head smiles breathlessly when she stops in front of them. \u201cCan I have your number? Just to discuss course materials and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Harry knows that look, those lectures would be the <i>last</i> thing this girl wants to talk about. Harry must admit he thinks she\u2019s really pretty, he froze for a second or two when he first saw her in the library; and if they\u2019d met a couple months ago, he would\u2019ve been the one to ask for <i>her</i> number. </p><p>But Harry\u2019s changed. She isn\u2019t<i> his Y/N</i>, and he\u2019s promised himself not to do this anymore. </p><p><i>No girl other than Y/N.</i></p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He gives her a shrug. \u201cMy girlfriend wouldn\u2019t be happy if I gave another girl my phone number.\u201d</p><p>Carrie is taken aback for she\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s single. Niall told her that! Harry, on the other note, doesn\u2019t feel like explaining. He just grabs Y/N by the hand and says goodbye to the other girl right away.</p><p>\u201cCome on, love.\u201d He turns to his flatmate. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend?\u201d Y/N raises an eyebrow at him as they continue walking with him still holding her hand. \u201cWho\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>\u2018I\u2019m taken</i>\u2019 is always a good way to tell someone you\u2019re not interested,\u201d he tells her with a silly grin on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you thought I called her \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019! I don\u2019t like her that way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Y/N can\u2019t help the smile on her face which has started to grow. \u201cYou like me\u2026<i>that</i> way?\u201d </p><p>The unexpected question turns Harry\u2019s body into stone right on the spot. If he looked at her right now he\u2019d get to see a vibrant beam which she\u2019s unable to hide; but Harry\u2019s too embarrassed to even take a quick glance at her after unintentionally letting those words escape.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, stop putting words in my mouth.\u201d Harry scoffs while shaking his head.</p><p>But Y/N is not disappointed, not at all.</p>",

The only girl he\u2019s ever called \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 before was his childhood best friend Olivia, whom he hasn\u2019t seen or heard from in years. But he grew up with her so she didn\u2019t really count. </p><p>That was before Y/N.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, <i>love</i>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey <i>love</i>, see you after class!\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Love</i>, I\u2019m going out, need me to get you anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGood night, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, <i>love</i>.\u201d</p><p>Harry calls his flatmate \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 so often that it\u2019s almost become her second name now. The first few times he called her \u2018<i>love</i>\u2019 was just to tease her, knowing she hated him and thought he was annoying. But the closer they get, the more he grows to enjoy calling her so, probably because of the way she starts blushing every single time, and because she is now really <i>that</i> to him, his <i>love</i>.</p><p>Y/N used to hate it, that pet name, since she assumed he used it with every girl he knew and for sure didn\u2019t take it seriously. However, they\u2019ve been living together for quite a long time now and she\u2019s never once heard him call any other girl he\u2019s brought home by that name, and honestly, it makes Y/N feel kinda special.</p><p>It\u2019s an ordinary Wednesday afternoon in the library, Harry\u2019s tutoring Y/N for this class she\u2019s struggling with. They\u2019ve spent two hours on one topic as Harry keeps explaining over and over again but his flatmate has her head somewhere on the clouds. No matter how hard she tries, Y/N just can\u2019t concentrate, because, <i>1</i>) his eyes are extra green today and she can\u2019t explain why, she just has to stare, <i>2</i>) he\u2018s so sexy in his new shirt, yellow has never looked better on him.</p><p>\u201cFocus!\u201d Harry taps his pencil slightly on Y/N\u2019s forehead when he catches her smiling for no reason. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst student I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d</p><p>His comment makes her giggle. \u201cI\u2019m the only student you\u2019ve ever had, H.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Y/N speaks way too soon. Just as she finishes that sentence, Niall shows up, walking behind him is a beautiful red head. She\u2019s got the type of face that only one look at it can immediately crush your self-confidence to dust. Y/N thinks she\u2019s seen the girl in a few of her classes before, they\u2019ve never spoken to each other though.</p><p>\u201cThis is my friend Carrie. Mind if she joins us?\u201d asks Niall, and Harry happily tells the girl to sit and that she\u2019s welcome here.</p><p>\u201cSorry love, you\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Harry whispers to Y/N with a smirk on his face. </p><p>She knows he means she\u2019s not his only <i>student</i> like she thought she was, but Y/N also understands it as she\u2019s not the only girl in his life and therefore she\u2019s not special. He didn\u2019t have to remind her of something she\u2019s already well aware of, the last thing she needs is another crack in the heart. <i>Thank you very much!</i></p><p>Niall and Carrie sit down in front of Harry and Y/N. Y/N doesn\u2019t like the way Carrie and Harry look at each other. It\u2019s like they\u2019re eye-fucking right here, in a library, with their friends in presence! <i>How inappropriate! </i>Moreover, this pretty girl showing up apparently makes Harry forget what he\u2019s <i>really</i> here for. He\u2019s gawking at Carrie now. Annoyed, Y/N taps her pencil on his forehead without warning, causing her flatmate to snap back to reality and shoot her a look of surprise. </p><p>\u201cFocus!\u201d She repeats what he said to her earlier, sounding slightly upset, though she doesn\u2019t think he can see it through.</p><p>.</p><p>Half an hour has passed and Y/N is getting more and more irritated.

Carrie is not subtly flirting anymore. She always finds excuses to touch Harry&rsquo;s hand, toy with his pen and draw silly doodles on the corner of his notebook page, and he lets her!!! Y/N thinks the two of them are probably playing footsies under the desk right now; she&rsquo;s afraid to look knowing she&rsquo;d get mad (even though she doesn&rsquo;t really have the right to). Therefore, Y/N decides to just ignore everything and pays attention to her textbook instead.</p><p>It&rsquo;s Harry who pulls her trigger.</p><p>Carrie mentions something about the information in the book and asks him if what she understands is right, to which he replies by saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s correct, <i>love</i>.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Love!!!</i></p><p>Y/N and Niall both turn to Harry the second they hear that word, while he&rsquo;s too busy taking note to notice the looks on their faces. </p><p>Y/N is <i>very</i> offended indeed! </p><p>Did he just call that girl &lsquo;<i>love</i>&rsquo;? He only calls <i>her</i> that. Even Niall knows it, since he appears just as shocked as Y/N is and even takes a glance at her to see her reaction. </p><p>Y/N is doubtlessly upset yet doesn&rsquo;t want to dramatize the whole situation, so she chooses to stay quiet. </p><p><i>It&rsquo;s just a stupid pet name, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything&hellip;</i>or at least that&rsquo;s what Y/N&rsquo;s trying to convince herself in order to feel better, which doesn&rsquo;t help, not even a little bit.</p><p>At the end of the afternoon, as they head back to the parking lot together alone, Y/N tries to avoid making eye contact with Harry at all costs. One look at him and she knows she&rsquo;ll explode. She&rsquo;s very mad and doesn&rsquo;t want to speak to him or hear him speak. Harry, being an oblivious dumbass, decides to start a conversation anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Love, why are you so quiet?&rdquo; He questions as he walks faster in order to catch up with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; she grumbles, which really catches him off guard.</p><p>&ldquo;Why? I thought you liked that nickname.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never do. It&rsquo;s cringy and annoying.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a lie. She thinks Harry cannot tell she&rsquo;s lying but of course he can. He&rsquo;s better at being a liar than she&rsquo;ll ever be.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He chuckles, lowering his head to look at her face but she turns it away from him, leaving him no choice but to poke her side. Y/N is <i>very</i> ticklish, and by doing so, Harry gets exactly the reaction he wants from her.</p><p>&ldquo;Knock it off!&rdquo; She slaps his hand away. &ldquo;Go do that to Carrie, she&rsquo;d sure like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, are you jealous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous, because you know what?&rdquo; She faces him with both hands on her hips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> one of your girls, so stop calling me &lsquo;<i>love</i>&rsquo; like I&rsquo;m one of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; He chuckles with a faint look of confusion. &ldquo;I only call you that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You called Carrie that,&rdquo; Y/N says before she can stop herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I sat right next to you. I heard it loud and clear. Niall did too!&rdquo;</p><p>As much as Harry loves the way she scrunches up her nose when she&rsquo;s mad, he doesn&rsquo;t like having her believe something that&rsquo;s not even close to the truth.</p><p>&ldquo;It might&rsquo;ve just slipped out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah right.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s not lying right now. He doesn&rsquo;t even remember calling anyone beside her by that pet name. Maybe he thought it was Y/N who was talking to him, or he was thinking of her and called Carrie &lsquo;<i>love</i>&rsquo; by accident. But how is he gonna explain that to Y/N without it being &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;m secretly in love with you, and you&rsquo;re always on my mind sometimes I can&rsquo;t think straight</i>&rsquo;?</p><p>&ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; Carrie shows up all of a sudden and runs to catch up with Harry and Y/N. </p><p><i>Shit</i>, the last thing he needs is her being here!</p><p>&ldquo;I forgot to ask.&rdquo; The red head smiles breathlessly when she stops in front of them. &ldquo;Can I have your number? Just to discuss course materials and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry knows that look, those lectures would be the <i>last</i> thing this girl wants to talk about. Harry must admit he thinks she&rsquo;s really pretty, he froze for a second or two when he first saw her in the library; and if they&rsquo;d met a couple months ago, he would&rsquo;ve been the one to ask for <i>her</i> number. </p><p>But Harry&rsquo;s changed. She isn&rsquo;t<i> his Y/N</i>, and he&rsquo;s promised himself not to do this anymore. </p><p><i>No girl other than Y/N.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; He gives her a shrug. &ldquo;My girlfriend wouldn&rsquo;t be happy if I gave another girl my phone number.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrie is taken aback for she&rsquo;s pretty sure he&rsquo;s single. Niall told her that! Harry, on the other note, doesn&rsquo;t feel like explaining. He just grabs Y/N by the hand and says goodbye to the other girl right away.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, love.&rdquo; He turns to his flatmate. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Girlfriend?&rdquo; Y/N raises an eyebrow at him as they continue walking with him still holding her hand. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your girlfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m taken</i>&rsquo; is always a good way to tell someone you&rsquo;re not interested,&rdquo; he tells her with a silly grin on his face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you thought I called her &lsquo;<i>love</i>&rsquo;! I don&rsquo;t like her that way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; Y/N can&rsquo;t help the smile on her face which has started to grow. &ldquo;You like me&hellip;<i>that</i> way?&rdquo; </p><p>The unexpected question turns Harry&rsquo;s body into stone right on the spot. If he looked at her right now he&rsquo;d get to see a vibrant beam which she&rsquo;s unable to hide; but Harry&rsquo;s too embarrassed to even take a quick glance at her after unintentionally letting those words escape.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I said, stop putting words in my mouth.&rdquo; Harry scoffs while shaking his head.</p><p>But Y/N is not disappointed, not at all.</p>",

Right?\u201d I asked as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>\u201dYeah but isn\u2019t inviting him over a bit much?\u201d Shawn asked as we sat down on the living room. We hadn\u2019t bothered gotten dressed or anything but I hadn\u2019t had nearly enough time to collect myself since the previous orgasm.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s revenge Shawn, it\u2019s supposed to be brutal.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dI mean, you could just send him a text or something?\u201d Shawn shrugged.</p><p>\u201dIf you\u2019re totally fine with me using you for this revengeful purpose then I don\u2019t see what the problem here is? It\u2019s about time you men get some shit for all the things you\u2019ve done to us.\u201d I argued as I crossed my arms on the couch.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re crazy Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed.</p><p>\u201dI may be crazy but you don\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201dYeah, because I\u2019ve known you long enough to get used to your crazy antics.\u201d Shawn said as he looked at me with his soft brown eyes.</p><p>\u201dWhat if you\u2019re the only man who\u2019s patient enough to live with me?\u201d I asked as I looked at him, flashing him a smile. We still felt like roommates, nothing had changed despite the fact that we\u2019d made each other come seconds ago.</p><p>\u201dThen I guess we\u2019ll have to get married.\u201d Shawn smiled as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t say things like that Shawn.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dWhy not Coco?\u201d He asked softly.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s things like that, that gets me hooked.\u201d I explained, knowing that there was no way in hell I could ever deal with any type of emotions for any man ever again and especially not my roommate.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shawn apologized swiftly.</p><p><i>Okay.</i></p><p>A message popped up on my phone and I knew it was on. I opened the message and read the whole thing, just to make sure it was Harry who\u2019d responded.</p><p><i>Come over and we\u2019ll talk.</i></p><p>One of the bubbles said and the other one was his response. Bingo.</p><p>\u201dHe\u2019s coming.\u201d I said as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>I know this might be a bit over the top and I know I\u2019m crazy for even doing something like this but a part of me, deep down inside, figured that this is exactly what I needed to move on. I\u2019m probably never gonna see Harry again so what difference does it make if I do something this crazy.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t mind me using you do you?\u201d I asked with a soft laugh as I climbed on top of Shawn, straddling him with my bare body as he sat with his large body spread out on the large white couch.</p><p>\u201dNot at all but what exactly do you think you\u2019re gonna get out of this Corinne?\u201d Shawn laughed as he ran his hands over my naked body, softly caressing my delicate skin.</p><p>\u201dNothing\u2026 It\u2019s just revenge. If he doesn\u2019t have any type of feelings for me then this shouldn\u2019t bother him what so ever.\u201d I said as I sat with my hands raised towards Shawn\u2019s head, twirling my fingers around his soft curls. \u201dI\u2019m doing exactly what you told me to do, I\u2019m being free.\u201d I argued with a giggle and Shawn looked at me, rolling his brown eyes as I scoot closer to him.</p><p>\u201dI did say that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Shawn murmured softly.</p><p>\u201dNo take back\u2019s.\u201d I giggled as I ran my fingers down the side of his face. Trailing his soft skin with my index finger all the way from his hairline down to his chin.</p><p>Silence took over the room as we once again stared into each others eyes. I pressed my lips together into a thin line before licking them gently with the tip of my tongue. The universe once again pulled us closer and closer together until our mouths reconnected.</p><p>We don\u2019t have to kiss, after all this is purely sexual, but for some reason we kept doing it and it felt really good kissing someone even when the kiss itself meant nothing. There was no pressure, no real emotions and maybe that\u2019s what made it so good. There wasn\u2019t much thought put into it. It was simply sensual and sexual and I lived that. I\u2019ve had casual one night stands before but nothing as casual as sex with my friend or in this case my roommate. I thought it would be awkward at first but honestly, I think we\u2019re more in sync than most of the other guys I\u2019ve been with.</p><p>\u201dRound two, already?\u201d I teased as I felt him grow hard between us. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this close to Shawn and we\u2019ve lived together for almost three years.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re saying it like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d Shawn whispered as his lips lingered on top of mine.</p><p>\u201dQuite the opposite. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d I released a soft giggle against his lips.</p><p>\u201dI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re about to do this.\u201d Shawn chuckled.</p><p>\u201dAs long as you\u2019re into it\u2026\u201d I could sense Shawn\u2019s hesitation which was understandable since I was going to use him for revenge purposes but if it wasn\u2019t for the anger inside my body I would probably still have casual sex with him at this point.</p><p>\u201dTrust me Corinne, I am totally into it.\u201d Shawn whispered with a low, husky voice as he ran his hands over my back and urged me closer to him for another kiss.</p><p>\u201dGood.\u201d I whispered breathlessly against his warm lips. His mouth took my breath away, as most amazing kissers do.</p><p>\u201dTell me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Shawn whispered as he leaned in to plant a couple of soft kisses down my sensitive neck. His mouth felt warm against my skin and his wet lips managed to leave a trail of saliva down my neck.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019ve been ready this entire time.\u201d I giggled as his tongue tickled my skin and playfully drew circles on my collarbone.</p><p>\u201dWell then, get up.\u201d Shawn flashed me a cocky smile as he waited for me to rise from my straddle. I let out a soft giggle as I moved closer to him, hovering my pussy over his hardened cock. My hands wrapped around his neck, gently tugging at his soft curls as he lined himself up beneath me.</p><p>I felt his tip teasingly brush in between my slit a few times before he finally managed to align it with my entrance. Without a word, I slowly began to sink down onto him, inch by inch with nothing but a loud gasp coming out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201dOkay, I knew you were big but I didn\u2019t know you were gonna be THAT big.\u201d I groaned as I felt my tight walls adjust around Shawn\u2019s thick cock.</p><p>\u201dYou literally had it in your hand like twenty minutes ago.\u201d Shawn chuckled as I tried to focus on his face, my eyes rolling back as every inch of him dug deeper and deeper inside me.</p><p>\u201dYeah but that\u2019s different.\u201d I groaned as I managed to finally sink all the way down onto his cock. \u201dIt feels so good though, oh my God.\u201d I praised as I sat on top of Shawn, savoring the feeling of having something as big as his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMhm, and you\u2019re so wet for me.\u201d Shawn groaned as he too stayed still inside me, letting me soak him with my arousal.</p><p>Maybe we should do this more often, casual sex. Who needs one night stands when you\u2019ve got a roommate with a big dick?</p><p>I slowly began to move on top of Shawn as my walls continued to adjust themselves to his large cock. I placed both hands on his shoulders as I slowly lifted myself up off his body only to push back down against him again.</p><p>\u201dBaby\u2026\u201d Shawn groaned as he kept his large hands on my hips, guiding me down onto him. As my body slowly adjusted itself, I began to ride him with more confidence. My knees pressed against the soft cushion of the couch and my hands found the strands at the nape of his neck, tugging gently at the soft brown curls.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d I huffed as I let out multiple panting breaths through my mouth.</p><p>The sound of our bodies colliding echoed through the room as I picked up my speed. I\u2019ve always been good on top and I really don\u2019t know where I get my stamina from since I\u2019m useless when it comes to any other kind of exercise.</p><p>\u201dGod, your cock feels nice.\u201d I complimented as I rolled my eyes back, enjoying the harsh movements of his cock pumping inside me. His hands still guided me down onto him as he tried his best to match his thrusts with mine. \u201dMmm.\u201d I let out a soft moan as I tried to bite my lip.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t have to hold back Corinne.\u201d Shawn groaned as he watched me try to fight the moans inside my throat. \u201dI want to hear you moan for me.\u201d I thought this would be weird since we\u2019re roommates and no matter what happens we\u2019re gonna have to face each other tomorrow but honestly, this felt just like any other sexual encounter I\u2019ve had.</p><p>\u201dUhhh.\u201d I groaned, moaning out loud. I\u2019m so used to having to hold my moans back whenever I masturbate, I guess it\u2019s become a habit.</p><p>\u201dThat\u2019s it baby, let me know I make you feel.\u201d Shawn said as he leaned forward to press his lips against mine.</p><p>In the middle of the kiss, unprepared to my knowledge, he stood up and pushed me down onto the couch without breaking the two of us apart. His large body mass hovered me on the couch and I let my hands trail down his back as he moved into me with force.</p><p>\u201dYes, oh my God yes.\u201d I moaned out loud, allowing myself to relax for a moment as he kept my legs spread and did most of the thrusting. I could feel his prominent back muscles as I held onto his shoulder blades, my nails leaving settled marks as they dug into his skin, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201dKeep fucking me.\u201d I moaned, knowing that he would probably keep going even if I didn\u2019t encourage him.</p><p>\u201dYour pussy is so tight, Jesus Christ.\u201d Shawn cussed under his breath as he hovered me.</p><p>\u201dHarder baby.\u201d I moaned as I clawed my fingertips over his shoulders and down his muscular arms. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame.</p><p>It was like I could feel his cock tearing up the walls inside my body and I\u2019d never felt something so amazing before.</p><p>\u201dGet on your knees.\u201d Shawn groaned as he freed himself for my body, just long enough for me to follow his command. I did as I was told and swiftly kneeled on top of the couch with my elbows resting against the armrest and my butt sticking up in the air as a teasing factor.</p><p>Shawn ran his hand over my wet pussy and rubbed it a few times, teasing me as he brushed his cock up against my ass. I wanted him so badly and I couldn\u2019t keep my moans of frustration back.</p><p>\u201dPlease.\u201d I whined as I felt him teasingly rub the tip of his cock against my clit.</p><p>\u201dDo you want this baby?\u201d He asked teasingly as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMmm, please.\u201d I begged, my voice soft and filled with frustration.</p><p>\u201dTell me you want it.\u201d Shawn ordered and I was already weak and almost giving into his teasing as I pushed myself back against his cock.</p><p>\u201dI want your cock\u2026\u201d I moaned softly, begging for mercy as I felt the arousal inside me drive me crazy. \u201dI want your cock inside me.\u201d I whined as I clenched my fists around the hard armrest.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d Shawn praised as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me and stayed still for a moment before surprising me with his force and shoving himself inside me.</p><p>\u201dYes!\u201d I screamed out loud as I was finally given exactly what my body craved. His hands swiftly found my hips and I could feel myself rock back and forth on the white couch. \u201dFuck, you\u2019re so deep.\u201d I groaned, it was like I could feel him inside my stomach.</p><p>Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and used his force to enter me. The pace was slower but his thrusts were rougher and I loved it. I loved being fucked hard.</p><p>There was a sudden knock on the door and the two of us stopped for a moment, knowing exactly who was on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s unlocked right?\u201d I asked Shawn. We always keep our door unlocked incase either one of us forgets a key, besides it\u2019s a safe building in a safe neighborhood.</p><p>\u201dMhm.\u201d Shawn groaned, not wanting to stop what we had going on.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to consider this cruel plan of mine before I cheerfully called out.</p><p>\u201dCome in, door\u2019s unlocked.\u201d I could hear the door handle twist and I wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous or scared about this moment. I actually felt pretty good about myself.</p><p>\u201dHarder.\u201d I moaned under my breath as I waited for Shawn to get back to what we were doing before.</p><p>\u201dWhatever happens next, I have no involvement in it.\u201d Shawn whispered under his breath.</p><p>\u201dJust shut up and fuck me.\u201d I groaned as I pushed my hips back against his body, longing for him to thrust equally as roughly into me as he did before.</p><p>He did as he was told and I was pleased with his pace and the way he forced his cock through my tight walls.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, just like that.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame in my voice. I could hear the tiny footsteps walk over from the doorway towards the living room. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I begged as Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and dug his fingers into my skin, pulling my body with him as we rocked back and forth.</p><p>I watched with wide eyes as Harry entered the room in silence. He looked a bit shocked but he didn\u2019t say anything. His eyes focused on mine and I bit the corner of my lip as I let out a soft whimper in pleasure.</p><p>His eyes watched with an intense gaze as Shawn continued to thrust into me, fulfilling his part of the revenge.</p><p>\u201dDo you want me to stop?\u201d I whispered as I looked straight into Harry\u2019s green eyes.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d He shook his head as he continued to watch me getting fucked by another man on top of the couch.</p><p>\u201dAre you jealous?\u201d I moaned softly as I had a hard time figuring out his facial expression.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d He muttered through his gritted teeth as he watched me push myself back onto my roommates cock.</p><p>\u201dIt feels so good Shawn, keep going.\u201d I moaned loudly to get my revenge on Harry but it didn\u2019t seem to work, he seemed equally as turned on as I was and maybe he was sort of liking this?</p><p>\u201dAre you gonna stop me?\u201d I whimpered as I met Harry\u2019s gaze, my fingers digging into the armrest as Shawn continued to ram into me from behind. His entire length filling me up so good.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d Harry answered as his eyes focused on my body.</p><p>Maybe my revenge didn\u2019t go exactly as I\u2019d planned, but then again he did seem a little jealous.</p><p>\u201dTake off your clothes.\u201d I ordered Harry and without hesitation, he stripped down completely and walked over to the edge of the couch where my elbows were resting against the armrest.</p><p>He reached over in an attempt to touch my back but I was quick to warn him.</p><p>\u201dUh-uh. This is my house Harry and I make the rules here.\u201d I said with a devious grin covering my lips.</p><p>\u201dFine.\u201d He let out a soft grunt.</p><p>\u201dWe weren\u2019t exclusive right?\u201d I moaned as I looked up at the naked man in front of me. \u201dGuess I\u2019m free to fuck whoever I want right?\u201d I said as I kept my gaze on him. \u201dUgh, yes baby, right there.\u201d I moaned as Shawn pushed inside me. He wasn\u2019t going fast enough for me to come, yet he was going hard enough to satisfy my needs, the perfect combo.</p><p>\u201dI guess so.\u201d Harry tried to keep his composure as he looked down at me. My right hand was getting a bit greedy as I reached up to touch his stomach, drifting away from the hard cock right in front of my face and instead trailing down his hips and over his muscular thigh.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m glad we aren\u2019t exclusive anymore, because God, he fucks me so much better than you do.\u201d I moaned in an attempt to get a rise out of Harry. At this point I didn\u2019t even want my revenge anymore. I just wanted him to fuck me too but I wasn\u2019t going to give it to him that easily.</p><p>\u201dIs that so?\u201d Harry raised his eyebrows at me as he challenged me with a skeptic gaze.</p><p>\u201dYeah\u2026\u201d I breathed out heavily. \u201dHis cock is so much bigger too.\u201d I moaned, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, they were both pretty big.</p><p>\u201dSure.\u201d Harry flashed me a skeptical grin.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you miss fucking this pussy?\u201d I moaned as I ran my fingers up his thigh and towards the base of his hard cock.</p><p>\u201dI do\u2026\u201d Harry said as he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201dWell that\u2019s too bad, you\u2019re not getting it.\u201d I moaned as I ran my hand slowly over the shaft of Harry\u2019s cock. His soft skin tickled my fingers before I reached the wet tip of it.</p><p>\u201dAnd what am I getting instead?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me with wide eyes. He was still confident enough to face the fact that I was getting fucked by another man and it didn\u2019t seem to bother him much at all. I guess this plan kind of failed but the pay off could still be sweet.</p><p>\u201dWhat do you want?\u201d I retorted as I looked at him, licking my lips slowly as I ran my thumb over his wet tip.</p><p>\u201dThat pretty little mouth of yours.\u201d He said in his low, husky voice as he watched me lean forward to plant a soft kiss against his sensitive skin.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re gonna have to take it.\u201d I whispered teasingly as I licked the tip of his cock and gently swirled my tongue over it again and again.</p><p>\u201dOh, I fucking will.\u201d He grinned as he grabbed me by my cheeks and stopped me from the teasing. He pushed his cock deep into my mouth and it felt like I was going to choke but I knew better than that. I breathed heavily through my nose as he kept his cock inside my mouth, wetting it with the saliva produced in my mouth.</p><p>I looked up at him with mercy in my eyes and his grin widened as he began to slowly thrust his cock inside my mouth.</p><p>\u201dFuck, being exclusive. This is the sexiest you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Harry called out as he looked down at me. \u201dAnd you like it too, don\u2019t you? Having two cocks inside you feels good huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMmmphf.\u201d I managed to moan through my stuffed mouth. I did like it.</p><p>\u201dThink you\u2019re gonna make me jealous huh?\u201d Harry growled as he began to thrust in and out my mouth, only allowing short millisecond breaks for me to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201dHoly fuck.\u201d I groaned as I felt the two cocks enter me and move in sync inside my body. I\u2019d never taken two cocks before in my entire life but this felt amazing. Being single and free felt amazing.</p><p>\u201dAre you having fun baby?\u201d Harry asked as he allowed me to breathe for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201dMhmmm.\u201d I nodded, my face still in his hands. \u201dYes, fuck me like that.\u201d I called out as Shawn\u2019s rough hips collided with my cheeks. His cock entering me with force and determination and I felt my knees wobble against the soft cushion. \u201dOh my God Shawn.\u201d I moaned his name out loud in pure bliss. The walls inside me were tightening up around him and I could feel my stomach and every other muscle in my body tense up.</p><p>\u201dLet me see you come all over his cock baby.\u201d Harry growled as he ran his fingers through my hair and tugged at the roots, making me look up at him. \u201dAre you gonna let him come inside you?\u201d Harry asked and I nodded my head.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d I whined, my voice full with mercy. Birth control, once again allowing me to have the best sexual experience ever.</p><p>\u201dGood. Once he\u2019s done coming inside that tight little pussy, I\u2019m gonna fill that pretty little mouth of yours up. Understand?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dUh-huh.\u201d I moaned as I watched him press his cock against my lips once again.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d He said as he let go of my hair and used both hands to cup my face while pushing his cock back into my mouth.</p><p>I could feel the two of them move inside my holes and it was like I was paralyzed in the middle. My body got the best of me as arousal coursed through every vein in my blood.</p><p>\u201dMmm, I\u2019m gonna come Shawn.\u201d I choked out as some kind of warning while Harry moved his cock inside my mouth. I could feel my tight walls clenching around Shawn\u2019s hard cock. The tingles inside my body were already too much for me and it didn\u2019t help that he was manipulating my clit with one of his hands.</p><p>\u201dBe a good girl and come all over his cock.\u201d Harry groaned as he looked deep into my eyes while I sucked his cock with my generous mouth. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m into this even though my plan backfired.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u201d I groaned as I pushed Harry away from me, allowing me to moan out loud as I felt my walls squeeze around Shawn, milking him hard as my orgasm ripped through my body. \u201dI\u2019m coming.\u201d I screamed at the top of my lungs. I couldn\u2019t hold anything back. I was too worn out and my muscles just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201dFuck Coco.\u201d Shawn growled under his breath and although I hate the fact that he calls me Coco, he somehow made it sound intimate and erotic at this point.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, come inside me.\u201d I moaned as I felt him push deep inside me before stopping completely, allowing himself to empty himself inside me.</p><p>Harry grabbed a hold of my face once again and I had no choice but to suck as he thrusted in and out of my mouth, eager to come as well.</p><p>\u201dMmmpfh.\u201d I moaned as I felt Shawn rub his fingers in circles over my extremely sensitive clit.</p><p>Harry continued to thrust into my mouth and I let out multiple groans as I looked up at his mesmerizing face. He was gorgeous and I hated him for it. He made me fall for him without having any intention to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re such a good cocksucker Corinne.\u201d Harry praised me and I sucked harder. I wanted to show him exactly what he was going to be missing out on because even though my planned revenge hadn\u2019t played out exactly as I\u2019d wanted it to. I was never going to see him again, not after this. I\u2019m over it. Being single is so much more fun and maybe I\u2019ll take advantage of having a male roommate like my friends said I should do.</p><p>\u201dCome in my mouth.\u201d I whispered as I began to stroke Harry\u2019s cock with my hand and my tongue waiting, lingering against the tip of him.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d Harry huffed as he looked down at me. \u201dGot such a pretty mouth baby.\u201d He groaned as he watched me purse my lips and run them over his cock. Planting sloppy kisses all over his tip.</p><p>\u201dI want your come.\u201d I moaned as I waited for him to spill inside my mouth. His abs flexed and I could tell he was close as he twitched in my hand.</p><p>\u201dI need your lips back on my cock.\u201d Harry growled and I playfully sucked at the tip of his cock before taking him back into my mouth.</p><p>\u201dMmm.\u201d I moaned with his cock inside my mouth. The sooner he came, the sooner he could get the fuck out of here. It was fun while it lasted but I just had the best orgasm of my life and it turns out I don\u2019t need him anymore.</p><p>\u201dGod, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Harry released a husky growl as I kept sucking around him. He spilled inside me and I swallowed every little droplet.</p><p>\u201dWell that was fun, you know where the door is.\u201d I said as I sat down normally on the couch.</p><p>\u201dWait, we\u2019re not gonna talk about things?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me confused while I wiped my lips with my hand.</p><p>\u201dNope.\u201d I smiled politely. \u201dI\u2019ve decided that being single is way more fun.\u201d I said as I looked up at him with a grin on my lips. I guess this was my revenge. Now that he knows what he\u2019s missing out on, he\u2019s never gonna forget me.</p><p>\u201dSeriously?\u201d Harry looked at me like I was insane.</p><p>\u201dFeel free to close the door behind you.\u201d I said as I watched him get dressed.</p><p>\u201dWhatever.\u201d Harry called back as he walked towards the door and a few seconds later, the door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201dYou are cruel Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed as he sat down next to me on the couch. \u201dRemind me to not ever mess with you eh.\u201d</p><p>\u201dFair enough.\u201d I laughed as I looked over at Shawn. \u201dWanna go for another round?\u201d</p><p><b>If you like this leave a reblog.</b></p><p><i><a href=\"http://stylesbabygirls.tumblr.com/post/137082586146/masterlist-enjoy-the-endless-smut-do-not-repost\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></i></p>",

Right?\u201d I asked as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>\u201dYeah but isn\u2019t inviting him over a bit much?\u201d Shawn asked as we sat down on the living room. We hadn\u2019t bothered gotten dressed or anything but I hadn\u2019t had nearly enough time to collect myself since the previous orgasm.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s revenge Shawn, it\u2019s supposed to be brutal.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dI mean, you could just send him a text or something?\u201d Shawn shrugged.</p><p>\u201dIf you\u2019re totally fine with me using you for this revengeful purpose then I don\u2019t see what the problem here is? It\u2019s about time you men get some shit for all the things you\u2019ve done to us.\u201d I argued as I crossed my arms on the couch.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re crazy Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed.</p><p>\u201dI may be crazy but you don\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201dYeah, because I\u2019ve known you long enough to get used to your crazy antics.\u201d Shawn said as he looked at me with his soft brown eyes.</p><p>\u201dWhat if you\u2019re the only man who\u2019s patient enough to live with me?\u201d I asked as I looked at him, flashing him a smile. We still felt like roommates, nothing had changed despite the fact that we\u2019d made each other come seconds ago.</p><p>\u201dThen I guess we\u2019ll have to get married.\u201d Shawn smiled as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t say things like that Shawn.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dWhy not Coco?\u201d He asked softly.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s things like that, that gets me hooked.\u201d I explained, knowing that there was no way in hell I could ever deal with any type of emotions for any man ever again and especially not my roommate.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shawn apologized swiftly.</p><p><i>Okay.</i></p><p>A message popped up on my phone and I knew it was on. I opened the message and read the whole thing, just to make sure it was Harry who\u2019d responded.</p><p><i>Come over and we\u2019ll talk.</i></p><p>One of the bubbles said and the other one was his response. Bingo.</p><p>\u201dHe\u2019s coming.\u201d I said as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>I know this might be a bit over the top and I know I\u2019m crazy for even doing something like this but a part of me, deep down inside, figured that this is exactly what I needed to move on. I\u2019m probably never gonna see Harry again so what difference does it make if I do something this crazy.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t mind me using you do you?\u201d I asked with a soft laugh as I climbed on top of Shawn, straddling him with my bare body as he sat with his large body spread out on the large white couch.</p><p>\u201dNot at all but what exactly do you think you\u2019re gonna get out of this Corinne?\u201d Shawn laughed as he ran his hands over my naked body, softly caressing my delicate skin.</p><p>\u201dNothing\u2026 It\u2019s just revenge. If he doesn\u2019t have any type of feelings for me then this shouldn\u2019t bother him what so ever.\u201d I said as I sat with my hands raised towards Shawn\u2019s head, twirling my fingers around his soft curls. \u201dI\u2019m doing exactly what you told me to do, I\u2019m being free.\u201d I argued with a giggle and Shawn looked at me, rolling his brown eyes as I scoot closer to him.</p><p>\u201dI did say that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Shawn murmured softly.</p><p>\u201dNo take back\u2019s.\u201d I giggled as I ran my fingers down the side of his face. Trailing his soft skin with my index finger all the way from his hairline down to his chin.</p><p>Silence took over the room as we once again stared into each others eyes. I pressed my lips together into a thin line before licking them gently with the tip of my tongue. The universe once again pulled us closer and closer together until our mouths reconnected.</p><p>We don\u2019t have to kiss, after all this is purely sexual, but for some reason we kept doing it and it felt really good kissing someone even when the kiss itself meant nothing. There was no pressure, no real emotions and maybe that\u2019s what made it so good. There wasn\u2019t much thought put into it. It was simply sensual and sexual and I lived that. I\u2019ve had casual one night stands before but nothing as casual as sex with my friend or in this case my roommate. I thought it would be awkward at first but honestly, I think we\u2019re more in sync than most of the other guys I\u2019ve been with.</p><p>\u201dRound two, already?\u201d I teased as I felt him grow hard between us. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this close to Shawn and we\u2019ve lived together for almost three years.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re saying it like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d Shawn whispered as his lips lingered on top of mine.</p><p>\u201dQuite the opposite. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d I released a soft giggle against his lips.</p><p>\u201dI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re about to do this.\u201d Shawn chuckled.</p><p>\u201dAs long as you\u2019re into it\u2026\u201d I could sense Shawn\u2019s hesitation which was understandable since I was going to use him for revenge purposes but if it wasn\u2019t for the anger inside my body I would probably still have casual sex with him at this point.</p><p>\u201dTrust me Corinne, I am totally into it.\u201d Shawn whispered with a low, husky voice as he ran his hands over my back and urged me closer to him for another kiss.</p><p>\u201dGood.\u201d I whispered breathlessly against his warm lips. His mouth took my breath away, as most amazing kissers do.</p><p>\u201dTell me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Shawn whispered as he leaned in to plant a couple of soft kisses down my sensitive neck. His mouth felt warm against my skin and his wet lips managed to leave a trail of saliva down my neck.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019ve been ready this entire time.\u201d I giggled as his tongue tickled my skin and playfully drew circles on my collarbone.</p><p>\u201dWell then, get up.\u201d Shawn flashed me a cocky smile as he waited for me to rise from my straddle. I let out a soft giggle as I moved closer to him, hovering my pussy over his hardened cock. My hands wrapped around his neck, gently tugging at his soft curls as he lined himself up beneath me.</p><p>I felt his tip teasingly brush in between my slit a few times before he finally managed to align it with my entrance. Without a word, I slowly began to sink down onto him, inch by inch with nothing but a loud gasp coming out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201dOkay, I knew you were big but I didn\u2019t know you were gonna be THAT big.\u201d I groaned as I felt my tight walls adjust around Shawn\u2019s thick cock.</p><p>\u201dYou literally had it in your hand like twenty minutes ago.\u201d Shawn chuckled as I tried to focus on his face, my eyes rolling back as every inch of him dug deeper and deeper inside me.</p><p>\u201dYeah but that\u2019s different.\u201d I groaned as I managed to finally sink all the way down onto his cock. \u201dIt feels so good though, oh my God.\u201d I praised as I sat on top of Shawn, savoring the feeling of having something as big as his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMhm, and you\u2019re so wet for me.\u201d Shawn groaned as he too stayed still inside me, letting me soak him with my arousal.</p><p>Maybe we should do this more often, casual sex. Who needs one night stands when you\u2019ve got a roommate with a big dick?</p><p>I slowly began to move on top of Shawn as my walls continued to adjust themselves to his large cock. I placed both hands on his shoulders as I slowly lifted myself up off his body only to push back down against him again.</p><p>\u201dBaby\u2026\u201d Shawn groaned as he kept his large hands on my hips, guiding me down onto him. As my body slowly adjusted itself, I began to ride him with more confidence. My knees pressed against the soft cushion of the couch and my hands found the strands at the nape of his neck, tugging gently at the soft brown curls.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d I huffed as I let out multiple panting breaths through my mouth.</p><p>The sound of our bodies colliding echoed through the room as I picked up my speed. I\u2019ve always been good on top and I really don\u2019t know where I get my stamina from since I\u2019m useless when it comes to any other kind of exercise.</p><p>\u201dGod, your cock feels nice.\u201d I complimented as I rolled my eyes back, enjoying the harsh movements of his cock pumping inside me. His hands still guided me down onto him as he tried his best to match his thrusts with mine. \u201dMmm.\u201d I let out a soft moan as I tried to bite my lip.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t have to hold back Corinne.\u201d Shawn groaned as he watched me try to fight the moans inside my throat. \u201dI want to hear you moan for me.\u201d I thought this would be weird since we\u2019re roommates and no matter what happens we\u2019re gonna have to face each other tomorrow but honestly, this felt just like any other sexual encounter I\u2019ve had.</p><p>\u201dUhhh.\u201d I groaned, moaning out loud. I\u2019m so used to having to hold my moans back whenever I masturbate, I guess it\u2019s become a habit.</p><p>\u201dThat\u2019s it baby, let me know I make you feel.\u201d Shawn said as he leaned forward to press his lips against mine.</p><p>In the middle of the kiss, unprepared to my knowledge, he stood up and pushed me down onto the couch without breaking the two of us apart. His large body mass hovered me on the couch and I let my hands trail down his back as he moved into me with force.</p><p>\u201dYes, oh my God yes.\u201d I moaned out loud, allowing myself to relax for a moment as he kept my legs spread and did most of the thrusting. I could feel his prominent back muscles as I held onto his shoulder blades, my nails leaving settled marks as they dug into his skin, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201dKeep fucking me.\u201d I moaned, knowing that he would probably keep going even if I didn\u2019t encourage him.</p><p>\u201dYour pussy is so tight, Jesus Christ.\u201d Shawn cussed under his breath as he hovered me.</p><p>\u201dHarder baby.\u201d I moaned as I clawed my fingertips over his shoulders and down his muscular arms. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame.</p><p>It was like I could feel his cock tearing up the walls inside my body and I\u2019d never felt something so amazing before.</p><p>\u201dGet on your knees.\u201d Shawn groaned as he freed himself for my body, just long enough for me to follow his command. I did as I was told and swiftly kneeled on top of the couch with my elbows resting against the armrest and my butt sticking up in the air as a teasing factor.</p><p>Shawn ran his hand over my wet pussy and rubbed it a few times, teasing me as he brushed his cock up against my ass. I wanted him so badly and I couldn\u2019t keep my moans of frustration back.</p><p>\u201dPlease.\u201d I whined as I felt him teasingly rub the tip of his cock against my clit.</p><p>\u201dDo you want this baby?\u201d He asked teasingly as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMmm, please.\u201d I begged, my voice soft and filled with frustration.</p><p>\u201dTell me you want it.\u201d Shawn ordered and I was already weak and almost giving into his teasing as I pushed myself back against his cock.</p><p>\u201dI want your cock\u2026\u201d I moaned softly, begging for mercy as I felt the arousal inside me drive me crazy. \u201dI want your cock inside me.\u201d I whined as I clenched my fists around the hard armrest.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d Shawn praised as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me and stayed still for a moment before surprising me with his force and shoving himself inside me.</p><p>\u201dYes!\u201d I screamed out loud as I was finally given exactly what my body craved. His hands swiftly found my hips and I could feel myself rock back and forth on the white couch. \u201dFuck, you\u2019re so deep.\u201d I groaned, it was like I could feel him inside my stomach.</p><p>Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and used his force to enter me. The pace was slower but his thrusts were rougher and I loved it. I loved being fucked hard.</p><p>There was a sudden knock on the door and the two of us stopped for a moment, knowing exactly who was on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s unlocked right?\u201d I asked Shawn. We always keep our door unlocked incase either one of us forgets a key, besides it\u2019s a safe building in a safe neighborhood.</p><p>\u201dMhm.\u201d Shawn groaned, not wanting to stop what we had going on.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to consider this cruel plan of mine before I cheerfully called out.</p><p>\u201dCome in, door\u2019s unlocked.\u201d I could hear the door handle twist and I wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous or scared about this moment. I actually felt pretty good about myself.</p><p>\u201dHarder.\u201d I moaned under my breath as I waited for Shawn to get back to what we were doing before.</p><p>\u201dWhatever happens next, I have no involvement in it.\u201d Shawn whispered under his breath.</p><p>\u201dJust shut up and fuck me.\u201d I groaned as I pushed my hips back against his body, longing for him to thrust equally as roughly into me as he did before.</p><p>He did as he was told and I was pleased with his pace and the way he forced his cock through my tight walls.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, just like that.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame in my voice. I could hear the tiny footsteps walk over from the doorway towards the living room. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I begged as Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and dug his fingers into my skin, pulling my body with him as we rocked back and forth.</p><p>I watched with wide eyes as Harry entered the room in silence. He looked a bit shocked but he didn\u2019t say anything. His eyes focused on mine and I bit the corner of my lip as I let out a soft whimper in pleasure.</p><p>His eyes watched with an intense gaze as Shawn continued to thrust into me, fulfilling his part of the revenge.</p><p>\u201dDo you want me to stop?\u201d I whispered as I looked straight into Harry\u2019s green eyes.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d He shook his head as he continued to watch me getting fucked by another man on top of the couch.</p><p>\u201dAre you jealous?\u201d I moaned softly as I had a hard time figuring out his facial expression.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d He muttered through his gritted teeth as he watched me push myself back onto my roommates cock.</p><p>\u201dIt feels so good Shawn, keep going.\u201d I moaned loudly to get my revenge on Harry but it didn\u2019t seem to work, he seemed equally as turned on as I was and maybe he was sort of liking this?</p><p>\u201dAre you gonna stop me?\u201d I whimpered as I met Harry\u2019s gaze, my fingers digging into the armrest as Shawn continued to ram into me from behind. His entire length filling me up so good.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d Harry answered as his eyes focused on my body.</p><p>Maybe my revenge didn\u2019t go exactly as I\u2019d planned, but then again he did seem a little jealous.</p><p>\u201dTake off your clothes.\u201d I ordered Harry and without hesitation, he stripped down completely and walked over to the edge of the couch where my elbows were resting against the armrest.</p><p>He reached over in an attempt to touch my back but I was quick to warn him.</p><p>\u201dUh-uh. This is my house Harry and I make the rules here.\u201d I said with a devious grin covering my lips.</p><p>\u201dFine.\u201d He let out a soft grunt.</p><p>\u201dWe weren\u2019t exclusive right?\u201d I moaned as I looked up at the naked man in front of me. \u201dGuess I\u2019m free to fuck whoever I want right?\u201d I said as I kept my gaze on him. \u201dUgh, yes baby, right there.\u201d I moaned as Shawn pushed inside me. He wasn\u2019t going fast enough for me to come, yet he was going hard enough to satisfy my needs, the perfect combo.</p><p>\u201dI guess so.\u201d Harry tried to keep his composure as he looked down at me. My right hand was getting a bit greedy as I reached up to touch his stomach, drifting away from the hard cock right in front of my face and instead trailing down his hips and over his muscular thigh.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m glad we aren\u2019t exclusive anymore, because God, he fucks me so much better than you do.\u201d I moaned in an attempt to get a rise out of Harry. At this point I didn\u2019t even want my revenge anymore. I just wanted him to fuck me too but I wasn\u2019t going to give it to him that easily.</p><p>\u201dIs that so?\u201d Harry raised his eyebrows at me as he challenged me with a skeptic gaze.</p><p>\u201dYeah\u2026\u201d I breathed out heavily. \u201dHis cock is so much bigger too.\u201d I moaned, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, they were both pretty big.</p><p>\u201dSure.\u201d Harry flashed me a skeptical grin.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you miss fucking this pussy?\u201d I moaned as I ran my fingers up his thigh and towards the base of his hard cock.</p><p>\u201dI do\u2026\u201d Harry said as he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201dWell that\u2019s too bad, you\u2019re not getting it.\u201d I moaned as I ran my hand slowly over the shaft of Harry\u2019s cock. His soft skin tickled my fingers before I reached the wet tip of it.</p><p>\u201dAnd what am I getting instead?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me with wide eyes. He was still confident enough to face the fact that I was getting fucked by another man and it didn\u2019t seem to bother him much at all. I guess this plan kind of failed but the pay off could still be sweet.</p><p>\u201dWhat do you want?\u201d I retorted as I looked at him, licking my lips slowly as I ran my thumb over his wet tip.</p><p>\u201dThat pretty little mouth of yours.\u201d He said in his low, husky voice as he watched me lean forward to plant a soft kiss against his sensitive skin.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re gonna have to take it.\u201d I whispered teasingly as I licked the tip of his cock and gently swirled my tongue over it again and again.</p><p>\u201dOh, I fucking will.\u201d He grinned as he grabbed me by my cheeks and stopped me from the teasing. He pushed his cock deep into my mouth and it felt like I was going to choke but I knew better than that. I breathed heavily through my nose as he kept his cock inside my mouth, wetting it with the saliva produced in my mouth.</p><p>I looked up at him with mercy in my eyes and his grin widened as he began to slowly thrust his cock inside my mouth.</p><p>\u201dFuck, being exclusive. This is the sexiest you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Harry called out as he looked down at me. \u201dAnd you like it too, don\u2019t you? Having two cocks inside you feels good huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMmmphf.\u201d I managed to moan through my stuffed mouth. I did like it.</p><p>\u201dThink you\u2019re gonna make me jealous huh?\u201d Harry growled as he began to thrust in and out my mouth, only allowing short millisecond breaks for me to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201dHoly fuck.\u201d I groaned as I felt the two cocks enter me and move in sync inside my body. I\u2019d never taken two cocks before in my entire life but this felt amazing. Being single and free felt amazing.</p><p>\u201dAre you having fun baby?\u201d Harry asked as he allowed me to breathe for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201dMhmmm.\u201d I nodded, my face still in his hands. \u201dYes, fuck me like that.\u201d I called out as Shawn\u2019s rough hips collided with my cheeks. His cock entering me with force and determination and I felt my knees wobble against the soft cushion. \u201dOh my God Shawn.\u201d I moaned his name out loud in pure bliss. The walls inside me were tightening up around him and I could feel my stomach and every other muscle in my body tense up.</p><p>\u201dLet me see you come all over his cock baby.\u201d Harry growled as he ran his fingers through my hair and tugged at the roots, making me look up at him. \u201dAre you gonna let him come inside you?\u201d Harry asked and I nodded my head.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d I whined, my voice full with mercy. Birth control, once again allowing me to have the best sexual experience ever.</p><p>\u201dGood. Once he\u2019s done coming inside that tight little pussy, I\u2019m gonna fill that pretty little mouth of yours up. Understand?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dUh-huh.\u201d I moaned as I watched him press his cock against my lips once again.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d He said as he let go of my hair and used both hands to cup my face while pushing his cock back into my mouth.</p><p>I could feel the two of them move inside my holes and it was like I was paralyzed in the middle. My body got the best of me as arousal coursed through every vein in my blood.</p><p>\u201dMmm, I\u2019m gonna come Shawn.\u201d I choked out as some kind of warning while Harry moved his cock inside my mouth. I could feel my tight walls clenching around Shawn\u2019s hard cock. The tingles inside my body were already too much for me and it didn\u2019t help that he was manipulating my clit with one of his hands.</p><p>\u201dBe a good girl and come all over his cock.\u201d Harry groaned as he looked deep into my eyes while I sucked his cock with my generous mouth. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m into this even though my plan backfired.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u201d I groaned as I pushed Harry away from me, allowing me to moan out loud as I felt my walls squeeze around Shawn, milking him hard as my orgasm ripped through my body. \u201dI\u2019m coming.\u201d I screamed at the top of my lungs. I couldn\u2019t hold anything back. I was too worn out and my muscles just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201dFuck Coco.\u201d Shawn growled under his breath and although I hate the fact that he calls me Coco, he somehow made it sound intimate and erotic at this point.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, come inside me.\u201d I moaned as I felt him push deep inside me before stopping completely, allowing himself to empty himself inside me.</p><p>Harry grabbed a hold of my face once again and I had no choice but to suck as he thrusted in and out of my mouth, eager to come as well.</p><p>\u201dMmmpfh.\u201d I moaned as I felt Shawn rub his fingers in circles over my extremely sensitive clit.</p><p>Harry continued to thrust into my mouth and I let out multiple groans as I looked up at his mesmerizing face. He was gorgeous and I hated him for it. He made me fall for him without having any intention to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re such a good cocksucker Corinne.\u201d Harry praised me and I sucked harder. I wanted to show him exactly what he was going to be missing out on because even though my planned revenge hadn\u2019t played out exactly as I\u2019d wanted it to. I was never going to see him again, not after this. I\u2019m over it. Being single is so much more fun and maybe I\u2019ll take advantage of having a male roommate like my friends said I should do.</p><p>\u201dCome in my mouth.\u201d I whispered as I began to stroke Harry\u2019s cock with my hand and my tongue waiting, lingering against the tip of him.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d Harry huffed as he looked down at me. \u201dGot such a pretty mouth baby.\u201d He groaned as he watched me purse my lips and run them over his cock. Planting sloppy kisses all over his tip.</p><p>\u201dI want your come.\u201d I moaned as I waited for him to spill inside my mouth. His abs flexed and I could tell he was close as he twitched in my hand.</p><p>\u201dI need your lips back on my cock.\u201d Harry growled and I playfully sucked at the tip of his cock before taking him back into my mouth.</p><p>\u201dMmm.\u201d I moaned with his cock inside my mouth. The sooner he came, the sooner he could get the fuck out of here. It was fun while it lasted but I just had the best orgasm of my life and it turns out I don\u2019t need him anymore.</p><p>\u201dGod, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Harry released a husky growl as I kept sucking around him. He spilled inside me and I swallowed every little droplet.</p><p>\u201dWell that was fun, you know where the door is.\u201d I said as I sat down normally on the couch.</p><p>\u201dWait, we\u2019re not gonna talk about things?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me confused while I wiped my lips with my hand.</p><p>\u201dNope.\u201d I smiled politely. \u201dI\u2019ve decided that being single is way more fun.\u201d I said as I looked up at him with a grin on my lips. I guess this was my revenge. Now that he knows what he\u2019s missing out on, he\u2019s never gonna forget me.</p><p>\u201dSeriously?\u201d Harry looked at me like I was insane.</p><p>\u201dFeel free to close the door behind you.\u201d I said as I watched him get dressed.</p><p>\u201dWhatever.\u201d Harry called back as he walked towards the door and a few seconds later, the door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201dYou are cruel Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed as he sat down next to me on the couch. \u201dRemind me to not ever mess with you eh.\u201d</p><p>\u201dFair enough.\u201d I laughed as I looked over at Shawn. \u201dWanna go for another round?\u201d</p><p><b>If you like this leave a reblog.</b></p><p><i><a href=\"http://stylesbabygirls.tumblr.com/post/137082586146/masterlist-enjoy-the-endless-smut-do-not-repost\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></i></p>",

Right?\u201d I asked as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>\u201dYeah but isn\u2019t inviting him over a bit much?\u201d Shawn asked as we sat down on the living room. We hadn\u2019t bothered gotten dressed or anything but I hadn\u2019t had nearly enough time to collect myself since the previous orgasm.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s revenge Shawn, it\u2019s supposed to be brutal.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dI mean, you could just send him a text or something?\u201d Shawn shrugged.</p><p>\u201dIf you\u2019re totally fine with me using you for this revengeful purpose then I don\u2019t see what the problem here is? It\u2019s about time you men get some shit for all the things you\u2019ve done to us.\u201d I argued as I crossed my arms on the couch.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re crazy Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed.</p><p>\u201dI may be crazy but you don\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201dYeah, because I\u2019ve known you long enough to get used to your crazy antics.\u201d Shawn said as he looked at me with his soft brown eyes.</p><p>\u201dWhat if you\u2019re the only man who\u2019s patient enough to live with me?\u201d I asked as I looked at him, flashing him a smile. We still felt like roommates, nothing had changed despite the fact that we\u2019d made each other come seconds ago.</p><p>\u201dThen I guess we\u2019ll have to get married.\u201d Shawn smiled as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t say things like that Shawn.\u201d I said as I looked at him.</p><p>\u201dWhy not Coco?\u201d He asked softly.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s things like that, that gets me hooked.\u201d I explained, knowing that there was no way in hell I could ever deal with any type of emotions for any man ever again and especially not my roommate.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Shawn apologized swiftly.</p><p><i>Okay.</i></p><p>A message popped up on my phone and I knew it was on. I opened the message and read the whole thing, just to make sure it was Harry who\u2019d responded.</p><p><i>Come over and we\u2019ll talk.</i></p><p>One of the bubbles said and the other one was his response. Bingo.</p><p>\u201dHe\u2019s coming.\u201d I said as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>I know this might be a bit over the top and I know I\u2019m crazy for even doing something like this but a part of me, deep down inside, figured that this is exactly what I needed to move on. I\u2019m probably never gonna see Harry again so what difference does it make if I do something this crazy.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t mind me using you do you?\u201d I asked with a soft laugh as I climbed on top of Shawn, straddling him with my bare body as he sat with his large body spread out on the large white couch.</p><p>\u201dNot at all but what exactly do you think you\u2019re gonna get out of this Corinne?\u201d Shawn laughed as he ran his hands over my naked body, softly caressing my delicate skin.</p><p>\u201dNothing\u2026 It\u2019s just revenge. If he doesn\u2019t have any type of feelings for me then this shouldn\u2019t bother him what so ever.\u201d I said as I sat with my hands raised towards Shawn\u2019s head, twirling my fingers around his soft curls. \u201dI\u2019m doing exactly what you told me to do, I\u2019m being free.\u201d I argued with a giggle and Shawn looked at me, rolling his brown eyes as I scoot closer to him.</p><p>\u201dI did say that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Shawn murmured softly.</p><p>\u201dNo take back\u2019s.\u201d I giggled as I ran my fingers down the side of his face. Trailing his soft skin with my index finger all the way from his hairline down to his chin.</p><p>Silence took over the room as we once again stared into each others eyes. I pressed my lips together into a thin line before licking them gently with the tip of my tongue. The universe once again pulled us closer and closer together until our mouths reconnected.</p><p>We don\u2019t have to kiss, after all this is purely sexual, but for some reason we kept doing it and it felt really good kissing someone even when the kiss itself meant nothing. There was no pressure, no real emotions and maybe that\u2019s what made it so good. There wasn\u2019t much thought put into it. It was simply sensual and sexual and I lived that. I\u2019ve had casual one night stands before but nothing as casual as sex with my friend or in this case my roommate. I thought it would be awkward at first but honestly, I think we\u2019re more in sync than most of the other guys I\u2019ve been with.</p><p>\u201dRound two, already?\u201d I teased as I felt him grow hard between us. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this close to Shawn and we\u2019ve lived together for almost three years.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re saying it like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d Shawn whispered as his lips lingered on top of mine.</p><p>\u201dQuite the opposite. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d I released a soft giggle against his lips.</p><p>\u201dI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re about to do this.\u201d Shawn chuckled.</p><p>\u201dAs long as you\u2019re into it\u2026\u201d I could sense Shawn\u2019s hesitation which was understandable since I was going to use him for revenge purposes but if it wasn\u2019t for the anger inside my body I would probably still have casual sex with him at this point.</p><p>\u201dTrust me Corinne, I am totally into it.\u201d Shawn whispered with a low, husky voice as he ran his hands over my back and urged me closer to him for another kiss.</p><p>\u201dGood.\u201d I whispered breathlessly against his warm lips. His mouth took my breath away, as most amazing kissers do.</p><p>\u201dTell me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Shawn whispered as he leaned in to plant a couple of soft kisses down my sensitive neck. His mouth felt warm against my skin and his wet lips managed to leave a trail of saliva down my neck.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019ve been ready this entire time.\u201d I giggled as his tongue tickled my skin and playfully drew circles on my collarbone.</p><p>\u201dWell then, get up.\u201d Shawn flashed me a cocky smile as he waited for me to rise from my straddle. I let out a soft giggle as I moved closer to him, hovering my pussy over his hardened cock. My hands wrapped around his neck, gently tugging at his soft curls as he lined himself up beneath me.</p><p>I felt his tip teasingly brush in between my slit a few times before he finally managed to align it with my entrance. Without a word, I slowly began to sink down onto him, inch by inch with nothing but a loud gasp coming out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201dOkay, I knew you were big but I didn\u2019t know you were gonna be THAT big.\u201d I groaned as I felt my tight walls adjust around Shawn\u2019s thick cock.</p><p>\u201dYou literally had it in your hand like twenty minutes ago.\u201d Shawn chuckled as I tried to focus on his face, my eyes rolling back as every inch of him dug deeper and deeper inside me.</p><p>\u201dYeah but that\u2019s different.\u201d I groaned as I managed to finally sink all the way down onto his cock. \u201dIt feels so good though, oh my God.\u201d I praised as I sat on top of Shawn, savoring the feeling of having something as big as his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMhm, and you\u2019re so wet for me.\u201d Shawn groaned as he too stayed still inside me, letting me soak him with my arousal.</p><p>Maybe we should do this more often, casual sex. Who needs one night stands when you\u2019ve got a roommate with a big dick?</p><p>I slowly began to move on top of Shawn as my walls continued to adjust themselves to his large cock. I placed both hands on his shoulders as I slowly lifted myself up off his body only to push back down against him again.</p><p>\u201dBaby\u2026\u201d Shawn groaned as he kept his large hands on my hips, guiding me down onto him. As my body slowly adjusted itself, I began to ride him with more confidence. My knees pressed against the soft cushion of the couch and my hands found the strands at the nape of his neck, tugging gently at the soft brown curls.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d I huffed as I let out multiple panting breaths through my mouth.</p><p>The sound of our bodies colliding echoed through the room as I picked up my speed. I\u2019ve always been good on top and I really don\u2019t know where I get my stamina from since I\u2019m useless when it comes to any other kind of exercise.</p><p>\u201dGod, your cock feels nice.\u201d I complimented as I rolled my eyes back, enjoying the harsh movements of his cock pumping inside me. His hands still guided me down onto him as he tried his best to match his thrusts with mine. \u201dMmm.\u201d I let out a soft moan as I tried to bite my lip.</p><p>\u201dYou don\u2019t have to hold back Corinne.\u201d Shawn groaned as he watched me try to fight the moans inside my throat. \u201dI want to hear you moan for me.\u201d I thought this would be weird since we\u2019re roommates and no matter what happens we\u2019re gonna have to face each other tomorrow but honestly, this felt just like any other sexual encounter I\u2019ve had.</p><p>\u201dUhhh.\u201d I groaned, moaning out loud. I\u2019m so used to having to hold my moans back whenever I masturbate, I guess it\u2019s become a habit.</p><p>\u201dThat\u2019s it baby, let me know I make you feel.\u201d Shawn said as he leaned forward to press his lips against mine.</p><p>In the middle of the kiss, unprepared to my knowledge, he stood up and pushed me down onto the couch without breaking the two of us apart. His large body mass hovered me on the couch and I let my hands trail down his back as he moved into me with force.</p><p>\u201dYes, oh my God yes.\u201d I moaned out loud, allowing myself to relax for a moment as he kept my legs spread and did most of the thrusting. I could feel his prominent back muscles as I held onto his shoulder blades, my nails leaving settled marks as they dug into his skin, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind. \u201dKeep fucking me.\u201d I moaned, knowing that he would probably keep going even if I didn\u2019t encourage him.</p><p>\u201dYour pussy is so tight, Jesus Christ.\u201d Shawn cussed under his breath as he hovered me.</p><p>\u201dHarder baby.\u201d I moaned as I clawed my fingertips over his shoulders and down his muscular arms. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame.</p><p>It was like I could feel his cock tearing up the walls inside my body and I\u2019d never felt something so amazing before.</p><p>\u201dGet on your knees.\u201d Shawn groaned as he freed himself for my body, just long enough for me to follow his command. I did as I was told and swiftly kneeled on top of the couch with my elbows resting against the armrest and my butt sticking up in the air as a teasing factor.</p><p>Shawn ran his hand over my wet pussy and rubbed it a few times, teasing me as he brushed his cock up against my ass. I wanted him so badly and I couldn\u2019t keep my moans of frustration back.</p><p>\u201dPlease.\u201d I whined as I felt him teasingly rub the tip of his cock against my clit.</p><p>\u201dDo you want this baby?\u201d He asked teasingly as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me.</p><p>\u201dMmm, please.\u201d I begged, my voice soft and filled with frustration.</p><p>\u201dTell me you want it.\u201d Shawn ordered and I was already weak and almost giving into his teasing as I pushed myself back against his cock.</p><p>\u201dI want your cock\u2026\u201d I moaned softly, begging for mercy as I felt the arousal inside me drive me crazy. \u201dI want your cock inside me.\u201d I whined as I clenched my fists around the hard armrest.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d Shawn praised as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me and stayed still for a moment before surprising me with his force and shoving himself inside me.</p><p>\u201dYes!\u201d I screamed out loud as I was finally given exactly what my body craved. His hands swiftly found my hips and I could feel myself rock back and forth on the white couch. \u201dFuck, you\u2019re so deep.\u201d I groaned, it was like I could feel him inside my stomach.</p><p>Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and used his force to enter me. The pace was slower but his thrusts were rougher and I loved it. I loved being fucked hard.</p><p>There was a sudden knock on the door and the two of us stopped for a moment, knowing exactly who was on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201dIt\u2019s unlocked right?\u201d I asked Shawn. We always keep our door unlocked incase either one of us forgets a key, besides it\u2019s a safe building in a safe neighborhood.</p><p>\u201dMhm.\u201d Shawn groaned, not wanting to stop what we had going on.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to consider this cruel plan of mine before I cheerfully called out.</p><p>\u201dCome in, door\u2019s unlocked.\u201d I could hear the door handle twist and I wasn\u2019t the least bit nervous or scared about this moment. I actually felt pretty good about myself.</p><p>\u201dHarder.\u201d I moaned under my breath as I waited for Shawn to get back to what we were doing before.</p><p>\u201dWhatever happens next, I have no involvement in it.\u201d Shawn whispered under his breath.</p><p>\u201dJust shut up and fuck me.\u201d I groaned as I pushed my hips back against his body, longing for him to thrust equally as roughly into me as he did before.</p><p>He did as he was told and I was pleased with his pace and the way he forced his cock through my tight walls.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, just like that.\u201d I moaned out loud with no shame in my voice. I could hear the tiny footsteps walk over from the doorway towards the living room. \u201dFuck me harder.\u201d I begged as Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and dug his fingers into my skin, pulling my body with him as we rocked back and forth.</p><p>I watched with wide eyes as Harry entered the room in silence. He looked a bit shocked but he didn\u2019t say anything. His eyes focused on mine and I bit the corner of my lip as I let out a soft whimper in pleasure.</p><p>His eyes watched with an intense gaze as Shawn continued to thrust into me, fulfilling his part of the revenge.</p><p>\u201dDo you want me to stop?\u201d I whispered as I looked straight into Harry\u2019s green eyes.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d He shook his head as he continued to watch me getting fucked by another man on top of the couch.</p><p>\u201dAre you jealous?\u201d I moaned softly as I had a hard time figuring out his facial expression.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d He muttered through his gritted teeth as he watched me push myself back onto my roommates cock.</p><p>\u201dIt feels so good Shawn, keep going.\u201d I moaned loudly to get my revenge on Harry but it didn\u2019t seem to work, he seemed equally as turned on as I was and maybe he was sort of liking this?</p><p>\u201dAre you gonna stop me?\u201d I whimpered as I met Harry\u2019s gaze, my fingers digging into the armrest as Shawn continued to ram into me from behind. His entire length filling me up so good.</p><p>\u201dNo.\u201d Harry answered as his eyes focused on my body.</p><p>Maybe my revenge didn\u2019t go exactly as I\u2019d planned, but then again he did seem a little jealous.</p><p>\u201dTake off your clothes.\u201d I ordered Harry and without hesitation, he stripped down completely and walked over to the edge of the couch where my elbows were resting against the armrest.</p><p>He reached over in an attempt to touch my back but I was quick to warn him.</p><p>\u201dUh-uh. This is my house Harry and I make the rules here.\u201d I said with a devious grin covering my lips.</p><p>\u201dFine.\u201d He let out a soft grunt.</p><p>\u201dWe weren\u2019t exclusive right?\u201d I moaned as I looked up at the naked man in front of me. \u201dGuess I\u2019m free to fuck whoever I want right?\u201d I said as I kept my gaze on him. \u201dUgh, yes baby, right there.\u201d I moaned as Shawn pushed inside me. He wasn\u2019t going fast enough for me to come, yet he was going hard enough to satisfy my needs, the perfect combo.</p><p>\u201dI guess so.\u201d Harry tried to keep his composure as he looked down at me. My right hand was getting a bit greedy as I reached up to touch his stomach, drifting away from the hard cock right in front of my face and instead trailing down his hips and over his muscular thigh.</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m glad we aren\u2019t exclusive anymore, because God, he fucks me so much better than you do.\u201d I moaned in an attempt to get a rise out of Harry. At this point I didn\u2019t even want my revenge anymore. I just wanted him to fuck me too but I wasn\u2019t going to give it to him that easily.</p><p>\u201dIs that so?\u201d Harry raised his eyebrows at me as he challenged me with a skeptic gaze.</p><p>\u201dYeah\u2026\u201d I breathed out heavily. \u201dHis cock is so much bigger too.\u201d I moaned, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was true, they were both pretty big.</p><p>\u201dSure.\u201d Harry flashed me a skeptical grin.</p><p>\u201dDon\u2019t you miss fucking this pussy?\u201d I moaned as I ran my fingers up his thigh and towards the base of his hard cock.</p><p>\u201dI do\u2026\u201d Harry said as he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201dWell that\u2019s too bad, you\u2019re not getting it.\u201d I moaned as I ran my hand slowly over the shaft of Harry\u2019s cock. His soft skin tickled my fingers before I reached the wet tip of it.</p><p>\u201dAnd what am I getting instead?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me with wide eyes. He was still confident enough to face the fact that I was getting fucked by another man and it didn\u2019t seem to bother him much at all. I guess this plan kind of failed but the pay off could still be sweet.</p><p>\u201dWhat do you want?\u201d I retorted as I looked at him, licking my lips slowly as I ran my thumb over his wet tip.</p><p>\u201dThat pretty little mouth of yours.\u201d He said in his low, husky voice as he watched me lean forward to plant a soft kiss against his sensitive skin.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re gonna have to take it.\u201d I whispered teasingly as I licked the tip of his cock and gently swirled my tongue over it again and again.</p><p>\u201dOh, I fucking will.\u201d He grinned as he grabbed me by my cheeks and stopped me from the teasing. He pushed his cock deep into my mouth and it felt like I was going to choke but I knew better than that. I breathed heavily through my nose as he kept his cock inside my mouth, wetting it with the saliva produced in my mouth.</p><p>I looked up at him with mercy in my eyes and his grin widened as he began to slowly thrust his cock inside my mouth.</p><p>\u201dFuck, being exclusive. This is the sexiest you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Harry called out as he looked down at me. \u201dAnd you like it too, don\u2019t you? Having two cocks inside you feels good huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201dMmmphf.\u201d I managed to moan through my stuffed mouth. I did like it.</p><p>\u201dThink you\u2019re gonna make me jealous huh?\u201d Harry growled as he began to thrust in and out my mouth, only allowing short millisecond breaks for me to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201dHoly fuck.\u201d I groaned as I felt the two cocks enter me and move in sync inside my body. I\u2019d never taken two cocks before in my entire life but this felt amazing. Being single and free felt amazing.</p><p>\u201dAre you having fun baby?\u201d Harry asked as he allowed me to breathe for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201dMhmmm.\u201d I nodded, my face still in his hands. \u201dYes, fuck me like that.\u201d I called out as Shawn\u2019s rough hips collided with my cheeks. His cock entering me with force and determination and I felt my knees wobble against the soft cushion. \u201dOh my God Shawn.\u201d I moaned his name out loud in pure bliss. The walls inside me were tightening up around him and I could feel my stomach and every other muscle in my body tense up.</p><p>\u201dLet me see you come all over his cock baby.\u201d Harry growled as he ran his fingers through my hair and tugged at the roots, making me look up at him. \u201dAre you gonna let him come inside you?\u201d Harry asked and I nodded my head.</p><p>\u201dYes.\u201d I whined, my voice full with mercy. Birth control, once again allowing me to have the best sexual experience ever.</p><p>\u201dGood. Once he\u2019s done coming inside that tight little pussy, I\u2019m gonna fill that pretty little mouth of yours up. Understand?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201dUh-huh.\u201d I moaned as I watched him press his cock against my lips once again.</p><p>\u201dGood girl.\u201d He said as he let go of my hair and used both hands to cup my face while pushing his cock back into my mouth.</p><p>I could feel the two of them move inside my holes and it was like I was paralyzed in the middle. My body got the best of me as arousal coursed through every vein in my blood.</p><p>\u201dMmm, I\u2019m gonna come Shawn.\u201d I choked out as some kind of warning while Harry moved his cock inside my mouth. I could feel my tight walls clenching around Shawn\u2019s hard cock. The tingles inside my body were already too much for me and it didn\u2019t help that he was manipulating my clit with one of his hands.</p><p>\u201dBe a good girl and come all over his cock.\u201d Harry groaned as he looked deep into my eyes while I sucked his cock with my generous mouth. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m into this even though my plan backfired.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026 Fuck\u2026\u201d I groaned as I pushed Harry away from me, allowing me to moan out loud as I felt my walls squeeze around Shawn, milking him hard as my orgasm ripped through my body. \u201dI\u2019m coming.\u201d I screamed at the top of my lungs. I couldn\u2019t hold anything back. I was too worn out and my muscles just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201dFuck Coco.\u201d Shawn growled under his breath and although I hate the fact that he calls me Coco, he somehow made it sound intimate and erotic at this point.</p><p>\u201dYes baby, come inside me.\u201d I moaned as I felt him push deep inside me before stopping completely, allowing himself to empty himself inside me.</p><p>Harry grabbed a hold of my face once again and I had no choice but to suck as he thrusted in and out of my mouth, eager to come as well.</p><p>\u201dMmmpfh.\u201d I moaned as I felt Shawn rub his fingers in circles over my extremely sensitive clit.</p><p>Harry continued to thrust into my mouth and I let out multiple groans as I looked up at his mesmerizing face. He was gorgeous and I hated him for it. He made me fall for him without having any intention to reciprocate.</p><p>\u201dYou\u2019re such a good cocksucker Corinne.\u201d Harry praised me and I sucked harder. I wanted to show him exactly what he was going to be missing out on because even though my planned revenge hadn\u2019t played out exactly as I\u2019d wanted it to. I was never going to see him again, not after this. I\u2019m over it. Being single is so much more fun and maybe I\u2019ll take advantage of having a male roommate like my friends said I should do.</p><p>\u201dCome in my mouth.\u201d I whispered as I began to stroke Harry\u2019s cock with my hand and my tongue waiting, lingering against the tip of him.</p><p>\u201dFuck\u2026\u201d Harry huffed as he looked down at me. \u201dGot such a pretty mouth baby.\u201d He groaned as he watched me purse my lips and run them over his cock. Planting sloppy kisses all over his tip.</p><p>\u201dI want your come.\u201d I moaned as I waited for him to spill inside my mouth. His abs flexed and I could tell he was close as he twitched in my hand.</p><p>\u201dI need your lips back on my cock.\u201d Harry growled and I playfully sucked at the tip of his cock before taking him back into my mouth.</p><p>\u201dMmm.\u201d I moaned with his cock inside my mouth. The sooner he came, the sooner he could get the fuck out of here. It was fun while it lasted but I just had the best orgasm of my life and it turns out I don\u2019t need him anymore.</p><p>\u201dGod, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Harry released a husky growl as I kept sucking around him. He spilled inside me and I swallowed every little droplet.</p><p>\u201dWell that was fun, you know where the door is.\u201d I said as I sat down normally on the couch.</p><p>\u201dWait, we\u2019re not gonna talk about things?\u201d Harry asked as he looked at me confused while I wiped my lips with my hand.</p><p>\u201dNope.\u201d I smiled politely. \u201dI\u2019ve decided that being single is way more fun.\u201d I said as I looked up at him with a grin on my lips. I guess this was my revenge. Now that he knows what he\u2019s missing out on, he\u2019s never gonna forget me.</p><p>\u201dSeriously?\u201d Harry looked at me like I was insane.</p><p>\u201dFeel free to close the door behind you.\u201d I said as I watched him get dressed.</p><p>\u201dWhatever.\u201d Harry called back as he walked towards the door and a few seconds later, the door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201dYou are cruel Coco.\u201d Shawn laughed as he sat down next to me on the couch. \u201dRemind me to not ever mess with you eh.\u201d</p><p>\u201dFair enough.\u201d I laughed as I looked over at Shawn. \u201dWanna go for another round?\u201d</p><p><b>If you like this leave a reblog.</b></p><p><i><a href=\"http://stylesbabygirls.tumblr.com/post/137082586146/masterlist-enjoy-the-endless-smut-do-not-repost\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></i></p>",

Right?&rdquo; I asked as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah but isn&rsquo;t inviting him over a bit much?&rdquo; Shawn asked as we sat down on the living room. We hadn&rsquo;t bothered gotten dressed or anything but I hadn&rsquo;t had nearly enough time to collect myself since the previous orgasm.</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s revenge Shawn, it&rsquo;s supposed to be brutal.&rdquo; I said as I looked at him.</p><p>&rdquo;I mean, you could just send him a text or something?&rdquo; Shawn shrugged.</p><p>&rdquo;If you&rsquo;re totally fine with me using you for this revengeful purpose then I don&rsquo;t see what the problem here is? It&rsquo;s about time you men get some shit for all the things you&rsquo;ve done to us.&rdquo; I argued as I crossed my arms on the couch.</p><p>&rdquo;You&rsquo;re crazy Coco.&rdquo; Shawn laughed.</p><p>&rdquo;I may be crazy but you don&rsquo;t seem to mind.&rdquo; I laughed.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah, because I&rsquo;ve known you long enough to get used to your crazy antics.&rdquo; Shawn said as he looked at me with his soft brown eyes.</p><p>&rdquo;What if you&rsquo;re the only man who&rsquo;s patient enough to live with me?&rdquo; I asked as I looked at him, flashing him a smile. We still felt like roommates, nothing had changed despite the fact that we&rsquo;d made each other come seconds ago.</p><p>&rdquo;Then I guess we&rsquo;ll have to get married.&rdquo; Shawn smiled as he looked at me.</p><p>&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t say things like that Shawn.&rdquo; I said as I looked at him.</p><p>&rdquo;Why not Coco?&rdquo; He asked softly.</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s things like that, that gets me hooked.&rdquo; I explained, knowing that there was no way in hell I could ever deal with any type of emotions for any man ever again and especially not my roommate.</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Shawn apologized swiftly.</p><p><i>Okay.</i></p><p>A message popped up on my phone and I knew it was on. I opened the message and read the whole thing, just to make sure it was Harry who&rsquo;d responded.</p><p><i>Come over and we&rsquo;ll talk.</i></p><p>One of the bubbles said and the other one was his response. Bingo.</p><p>&rdquo;He&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo; I said as I looked at Shawn.</p><p>I know this might be a bit over the top and I know I&rsquo;m crazy for even doing something like this but a part of me, deep down inside, figured that this is exactly what I needed to move on. I&rsquo;m probably never gonna see Harry again so what difference does it make if I do something this crazy.</p><p>&rdquo;You don&rsquo;t mind me using you do you?&rdquo; I asked with a soft laugh as I climbed on top of Shawn, straddling him with my bare body as he sat with his large body spread out on the large white couch.</p><p>&rdquo;Not at all but what exactly do you think you&rsquo;re gonna get out of this Corinne?&rdquo; Shawn laughed as he ran his hands over my naked body, softly caressing my delicate skin.</p><p>&rdquo;Nothing&hellip; It&rsquo;s just revenge. If he doesn&rsquo;t have any type of feelings for me then this shouldn&rsquo;t bother him what so ever.&rdquo; I said as I sat with my hands raised towards Shawn&rsquo;s head, twirling my fingers around his soft curls. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m doing exactly what you told me to do, I&rsquo;m being free.&rdquo; I argued with a giggle and Shawn looked at me, rolling his brown eyes as I scoot closer to him.</p><p>&rdquo;I did say that, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Shawn murmured softly.</p><p>&rdquo;No take back&rsquo;s.&rdquo; I giggled as I ran my fingers down the side of his face. Trailing his soft skin with my index finger all the way from his hairline down to his chin.</p><p>Silence took over the room as we once again stared into each others eyes. I pressed my lips together into a thin line before licking them gently with the tip of my tongue. The universe once again pulled us closer and closer together until our mouths reconnected.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t have to kiss, after all this is purely sexual, but for some reason we kept doing it and it felt really good kissing someone even when the kiss itself meant nothing. There was no pressure, no real emotions and maybe that&rsquo;s what made it so good. There wasn&rsquo;t much thought put into it. It was simply sensual and sexual and I lived that. I&rsquo;ve had casual one night stands before but nothing as casual as sex with my friend or in this case my roommate. I thought it would be awkward at first but honestly, I think we&rsquo;re more in sync than most of the other guys I&rsquo;ve been with.</p><p>&rdquo;Round two, already?&rdquo; I teased as I felt him grow hard between us. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been this close to Shawn and we&rsquo;ve lived together for almost three years.</p><p>&rdquo;You&rsquo;re saying it like it&rsquo;s a bad thing.&rdquo; Shawn whispered as his lips lingered on top of mine.</p><p>&rdquo;Quite the opposite. I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo; I released a soft giggle against his lips.</p><p>&rdquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re about to do this.&rdquo; Shawn chuckled.</p><p>&rdquo;As long as you&rsquo;re into it&hellip;&rdquo; I could sense Shawn&rsquo;s hesitation which was understandable since I was going to use him for revenge purposes but if it wasn&rsquo;t for the anger inside my body I would probably still have casual sex with him at this point.</p><p>&rdquo;Trust me Corinne, I am totally into it.&rdquo; Shawn whispered with a low, husky voice as he ran his hands over my back and urged me closer to him for another kiss.</p><p>&rdquo;Good.&rdquo; I whispered breathlessly against his warm lips. His mouth took my breath away, as most amazing kissers do.</p><p>&rdquo;Tell me when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo; Shawn whispered as he leaned in to plant a couple of soft kisses down my sensitive neck. His mouth felt warm against my skin and his wet lips managed to leave a trail of saliva down my neck.</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;ve been ready this entire time.&rdquo; I giggled as his tongue tickled my skin and playfully drew circles on my collarbone.</p><p>&rdquo;Well then, get up.&rdquo; Shawn flashed me a cocky smile as he waited for me to rise from my straddle. I let out a soft giggle as I moved closer to him, hovering my pussy over his hardened cock. My hands wrapped around his neck, gently tugging at his soft curls as he lined himself up beneath me.</p><p>I felt his tip teasingly brush in between my slit a few times before he finally managed to align it with my entrance. Without a word, I slowly began to sink down onto him, inch by inch with nothing but a loud gasp coming out of my mouth.</p><p>&rdquo;Okay, I knew you were big but I didn&rsquo;t know you were gonna be THAT big.&rdquo; I groaned as I felt my tight walls adjust around Shawn&rsquo;s thick cock.</p><p>&rdquo;You literally had it in your hand like twenty minutes ago.&rdquo; Shawn chuckled as I tried to focus on his face, my eyes rolling back as every inch of him dug deeper and deeper inside me.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah but that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; I groaned as I managed to finally sink all the way down onto his cock. &rdquo;It feels so good though, oh my God.&rdquo; I praised as I sat on top of Shawn, savoring the feeling of having something as big as his cock inside me.</p><p>&rdquo;Mhm, and you&rsquo;re so wet for me.&rdquo; Shawn groaned as he too stayed still inside me, letting me soak him with my arousal.</p><p>Maybe we should do this more often, casual sex. Who needs one night stands when you&rsquo;ve got a roommate with a big dick?</p><p>I slowly began to move on top of Shawn as my walls continued to adjust themselves to his large cock. I placed both hands on his shoulders as I slowly lifted myself up off his body only to push back down against him again.</p><p>&rdquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; Shawn groaned as he kept his large hands on my hips, guiding me down onto him. As my body slowly adjusted itself, I began to ride him with more confidence. My knees pressed against the soft cushion of the couch and my hands found the strands at the nape of his neck, tugging gently at the soft brown curls.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; I huffed as I let out multiple panting breaths through my mouth.</p><p>The sound of our bodies colliding echoed through the room as I picked up my speed. I&rsquo;ve always been good on top and I really don&rsquo;t know where I get my stamina from since I&rsquo;m useless when it comes to any other kind of exercise.</p><p>&rdquo;God, your cock feels nice.&rdquo; I complimented as I rolled my eyes back, enjoying the harsh movements of his cock pumping inside me. His hands still guided me down onto him as he tried his best to match his thrusts with mine. &rdquo;Mmm.&rdquo; I let out a soft moan as I tried to bite my lip.</p><p>&rdquo;You don&rsquo;t have to hold back Corinne.&rdquo; Shawn groaned as he watched me try to fight the moans inside my throat. &rdquo;I want to hear you moan for me.&rdquo; I thought this would be weird since we&rsquo;re roommates and no matter what happens we&rsquo;re gonna have to face each other tomorrow but honestly, this felt just like any other sexual encounter I&rsquo;ve had.</p><p>&rdquo;Uhhh.&rdquo; I groaned, moaning out loud. I&rsquo;m so used to having to hold my moans back whenever I masturbate, I guess it&rsquo;s become a habit.</p><p>&rdquo;That&rsquo;s it baby, let me know I make you feel.&rdquo; Shawn said as he leaned forward to press his lips against mine.</p><p>In the middle of the kiss, unprepared to my knowledge, he stood up and pushed me down onto the couch without breaking the two of us apart. His large body mass hovered me on the couch and I let my hands trail down his back as he moved into me with force.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes, oh my God yes.&rdquo; I moaned out loud, allowing myself to relax for a moment as he kept my legs spread and did most of the thrusting. I could feel his prominent back muscles as I held onto his shoulder blades, my nails leaving settled marks as they dug into his skin, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. &rdquo;Keep fucking me.&rdquo; I moaned, knowing that he would probably keep going even if I didn&rsquo;t encourage him.</p><p>&rdquo;Your pussy is so tight, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Shawn cussed under his breath as he hovered me.</p><p>&rdquo;Harder baby.&rdquo; I moaned as I clawed my fingertips over his shoulders and down his muscular arms. &rdquo;Fuck me harder.&rdquo; I moaned out loud with no shame.</p><p>It was like I could feel his cock tearing up the walls inside my body and I&rsquo;d never felt something so amazing before.</p><p>&rdquo;Get on your knees.&rdquo; Shawn groaned as he freed himself for my body, just long enough for me to follow his command. I did as I was told and swiftly kneeled on top of the couch with my elbows resting against the armrest and my butt sticking up in the air as a teasing factor.</p><p>Shawn ran his hand over my wet pussy and rubbed it a few times, teasing me as he brushed his cock up against my ass. I wanted him so badly and I couldn&rsquo;t keep my moans of frustration back.</p><p>&rdquo;Please.&rdquo; I whined as I felt him teasingly rub the tip of his cock against my clit.</p><p>&rdquo;Do you want this baby?&rdquo; He asked teasingly as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me.</p><p>&rdquo;Mmm, please.&rdquo; I begged, my voice soft and filled with frustration.</p><p>&rdquo;Tell me you want it.&rdquo; Shawn ordered and I was already weak and almost giving into his teasing as I pushed myself back against his cock.</p><p>&rdquo;I want your cock&hellip;&rdquo; I moaned softly, begging for mercy as I felt the arousal inside me drive me crazy. &rdquo;I want your cock inside me.&rdquo; I whined as I clenched my fists around the hard armrest.</p><p>&rdquo;Good girl.&rdquo; Shawn praised as he dipped the tip of his cock inside me and stayed still for a moment before surprising me with his force and shoving himself inside me.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes!&rdquo; I screamed out loud as I was finally given exactly what my body craved. His hands swiftly found my hips and I could feel myself rock back and forth on the white couch. &rdquo;Fuck, you&rsquo;re so deep.&rdquo; I groaned, it was like I could feel him inside my stomach.</p><p>Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and used his force to enter me. The pace was slower but his thrusts were rougher and I loved it. I loved being fucked hard.</p><p>There was a sudden knock on the door and the two of us stopped for a moment, knowing exactly who was on the other side of the door.</p><p>&rdquo;It&rsquo;s unlocked right?&rdquo; I asked Shawn. We always keep our door unlocked incase either one of us forgets a key, besides it&rsquo;s a safe building in a safe neighborhood.</p><p>&rdquo;Mhm.&rdquo; Shawn groaned, not wanting to stop what we had going on.</p><p>It took me a few seconds to consider this cruel plan of mine before I cheerfully called out.</p><p>&rdquo;Come in, door&rsquo;s unlocked.&rdquo; I could hear the door handle twist and I wasn&rsquo;t the least bit nervous or scared about this moment. I actually felt pretty good about myself.</p><p>&rdquo;Harder.&rdquo; I moaned under my breath as I waited for Shawn to get back to what we were doing before.</p><p>&rdquo;Whatever happens next, I have no involvement in it.&rdquo; Shawn whispered under his breath.</p><p>&rdquo;Just shut up and fuck me.&rdquo; I groaned as I pushed my hips back against his body, longing for him to thrust equally as roughly into me as he did before.</p><p>He did as he was told and I was pleased with his pace and the way he forced his cock through my tight walls.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes baby, just like that.&rdquo; I moaned out loud with no shame in my voice. I could hear the tiny footsteps walk over from the doorway towards the living room. &rdquo;Fuck me harder.&rdquo; I begged as Shawn squeezed his hands around my hips and dug his fingers into my skin, pulling my body with him as we rocked back and forth.</p><p>I watched with wide eyes as Harry entered the room in silence. He looked a bit shocked but he didn&rsquo;t say anything. His eyes focused on mine and I bit the corner of my lip as I let out a soft whimper in pleasure.</p><p>His eyes watched with an intense gaze as Shawn continued to thrust into me, fulfilling his part of the revenge.</p><p>&rdquo;Do you want me to stop?&rdquo; I whispered as I looked straight into Harry&rsquo;s green eyes.</p><p>&rdquo;No.&rdquo; He shook his head as he continued to watch me getting fucked by another man on top of the couch.</p><p>&rdquo;Are you jealous?&rdquo; I moaned softly as I had a hard time figuring out his facial expression.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes.&rdquo; He muttered through his gritted teeth as he watched me push myself back onto my roommates cock.</p><p>&rdquo;It feels so good Shawn, keep going.&rdquo; I moaned loudly to get my revenge on Harry but it didn&rsquo;t seem to work, he seemed equally as turned on as I was and maybe he was sort of liking this?</p><p>&rdquo;Are you gonna stop me?&rdquo; I whimpered as I met Harry&rsquo;s gaze, my fingers digging into the armrest as Shawn continued to ram into me from behind. His entire length filling me up so good.</p><p>&rdquo;No.&rdquo; Harry answered as his eyes focused on my body.</p><p>Maybe my revenge didn&rsquo;t go exactly as I&rsquo;d planned, but then again he did seem a little jealous.</p><p>&rdquo;Take off your clothes.&rdquo; I ordered Harry and without hesitation, he stripped down completely and walked over to the edge of the couch where my elbows were resting against the armrest.</p><p>He reached over in an attempt to touch my back but I was quick to warn him.</p><p>&rdquo;Uh-uh. This is my house Harry and I make the rules here.&rdquo; I said with a devious grin covering my lips.</p><p>&rdquo;Fine.&rdquo; He let out a soft grunt.</p><p>&rdquo;We weren&rsquo;t exclusive right?&rdquo; I moaned as I looked up at the naked man in front of me. &rdquo;Guess I&rsquo;m free to fuck whoever I want right?&rdquo; I said as I kept my gaze on him. &rdquo;Ugh, yes baby, right there.&rdquo; I moaned as Shawn pushed inside me. He wasn&rsquo;t going fast enough for me to come, yet he was going hard enough to satisfy my needs, the perfect combo.</p><p>&rdquo;I guess so.&rdquo; Harry tried to keep his composure as he looked down at me. My right hand was getting a bit greedy as I reached up to touch his stomach, drifting away from the hard cock right in front of my face and instead trailing down his hips and over his muscular thigh.</p><p>&rdquo;I&rsquo;m glad we aren&rsquo;t exclusive anymore, because God, he fucks me so much better than you do.&rdquo; I moaned in an attempt to get a rise out of Harry. At this point I didn&rsquo;t even want my revenge anymore. I just wanted him to fuck me too but I wasn&rsquo;t going to give it to him that easily.</p><p>&rdquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Harry raised his eyebrows at me as he challenged me with a skeptic gaze.</p><p>&rdquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; I breathed out heavily. &rdquo;His cock is so much bigger too.&rdquo; I moaned, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was true, they were both pretty big.</p><p>&rdquo;Sure.&rdquo; Harry flashed me a skeptical grin.</p><p>&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t you miss fucking this pussy?&rdquo; I moaned as I ran my fingers up his thigh and towards the base of his hard cock.</p><p>&rdquo;I do&hellip;&rdquo; Harry said as he looked down at me.</p><p>&rdquo;Well that&rsquo;s too bad, you&rsquo;re not getting it.&rdquo; I moaned as I ran my hand slowly over the shaft of Harry&rsquo;s cock. His soft skin tickled my fingers before I reached the wet tip of it.</p><p>&rdquo;And what am I getting instead?&rdquo; Harry asked as he looked at me with wide eyes. He was still confident enough to face the fact that I was getting fucked by another man and it didn&rsquo;t seem to bother him much at all. I guess this plan kind of failed but the pay off could still be sweet.</p><p>&rdquo;What do you want?&rdquo; I retorted as I looked at him, licking my lips slowly as I ran my thumb over his wet tip.</p><p>&rdquo;That pretty little mouth of yours.&rdquo; He said in his low, husky voice as he watched me lean forward to plant a soft kiss against his sensitive skin.</p><p>&rdquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to take it.&rdquo; I whispered teasingly as I licked the tip of his cock and gently swirled my tongue over it again and again.</p><p>&rdquo;Oh, I fucking will.&rdquo; He grinned as he grabbed me by my cheeks and stopped me from the teasing. He pushed his cock deep into my mouth and it felt like I was going to choke but I knew better than that. I breathed heavily through my nose as he kept his cock inside my mouth, wetting it with the saliva produced in my mouth.</p><p>I looked up at him with mercy in my eyes and his grin widened as he began to slowly thrust his cock inside my mouth.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck, being exclusive. This is the sexiest you&rsquo;ve ever been.&rdquo; Harry called out as he looked down at me. &rdquo;And you like it too, don&rsquo;t you? Having two cocks inside you feels good huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Mmmphf.&rdquo; I managed to moan through my stuffed mouth. I did like it.</p><p>&rdquo;Think you&rsquo;re gonna make me jealous huh?&rdquo; Harry growled as he began to thrust in and out my mouth, only allowing short millisecond breaks for me to catch my breath.</p><p>&rdquo;Holy fuck.&rdquo; I groaned as I felt the two cocks enter me and move in sync inside my body. I&rsquo;d never taken two cocks before in my entire life but this felt amazing. Being single and free felt amazing.</p><p>&rdquo;Are you having fun baby?&rdquo; Harry asked as he allowed me to breathe for a few seconds.</p><p>&rdquo;Mhmmm.&rdquo; I nodded, my face still in his hands. &rdquo;Yes, fuck me like that.&rdquo; I called out as Shawn&rsquo;s rough hips collided with my cheeks. His cock entering me with force and determination and I felt my knees wobble against the soft cushion. &rdquo;Oh my God Shawn.&rdquo; I moaned his name out loud in pure bliss. The walls inside me were tightening up around him and I could feel my stomach and every other muscle in my body tense up.</p><p>&rdquo;Let me see you come all over his cock baby.&rdquo; Harry growled as he ran his fingers through my hair and tugged at the roots, making me look up at him. &rdquo;Are you gonna let him come inside you?&rdquo; Harry asked and I nodded my head.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes.&rdquo; I whined, my voice full with mercy. Birth control, once again allowing me to have the best sexual experience ever.</p><p>&rdquo;Good. Once he&rsquo;s done coming inside that tight little pussy, I&rsquo;m gonna fill that pretty little mouth of yours up. Understand?&rdquo; Harry asked as he looked at me.</p><p>&rdquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo; I moaned as I watched him press his cock against my lips once again.</p><p>&rdquo;Good girl.&rdquo; He said as he let go of my hair and used both hands to cup my face while pushing his cock back into my mouth.</p><p>I could feel the two of them move inside my holes and it was like I was paralyzed in the middle. My body got the best of me as arousal coursed through every vein in my blood.</p><p>&rdquo;Mmm, I&rsquo;m gonna come Shawn.&rdquo; I choked out as some kind of warning while Harry moved his cock inside my mouth. I could feel my tight walls clenching around Shawn&rsquo;s hard cock. The tingles inside my body were already too much for me and it didn&rsquo;t help that he was manipulating my clit with one of his hands.</p><p>&rdquo;Be a good girl and come all over his cock.&rdquo; Harry groaned as he looked deep into my eyes while I sucked his cock with my generous mouth. He&rsquo;s lucky I&rsquo;m into this even though my plan backfired.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck&hellip; Fuck&hellip; Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; I groaned as I pushed Harry away from me, allowing me to moan out loud as I felt my walls squeeze around Shawn, milking him hard as my orgasm ripped through my body. &rdquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; I screamed at the top of my lungs. I couldn&rsquo;t hold anything back. I was too worn out and my muscles just couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck Coco.&rdquo; Shawn growled under his breath and although I hate the fact that he calls me Coco, he somehow made it sound intimate and erotic at this point.</p><p>&rdquo;Yes baby, come inside me.&rdquo; I moaned as I felt him push deep inside me before stopping completely, allowing himself to empty himself inside me.</p><p>Harry grabbed a hold of my face once again and I had no choice but to suck as he thrusted in and out of my mouth, eager to come as well.</p><p>&rdquo;Mmmpfh.&rdquo; I moaned as I felt Shawn rub his fingers in circles over my extremely sensitive clit.</p><p>Harry continued to thrust into my mouth and I let out multiple groans as I looked up at his mesmerizing face. He was gorgeous and I hated him for it. He made me fall for him without having any intention to reciprocate.</p><p>&rdquo;You&rsquo;re such a good cocksucker Corinne.&rdquo; Harry praised me and I sucked harder. I wanted to show him exactly what he was going to be missing out on because even though my planned revenge hadn&rsquo;t played out exactly as I&rsquo;d wanted it to. I was never going to see him again, not after this. I&rsquo;m over it. Being single is so much more fun and maybe I&rsquo;ll take advantage of having a male roommate like my friends said I should do.</p><p>&rdquo;Come in my mouth.&rdquo; I whispered as I began to stroke Harry&rsquo;s cock with my hand and my tongue waiting, lingering against the tip of him.</p><p>&rdquo;Fuck&hellip;&rdquo; Harry huffed as he looked down at me. &rdquo;Got such a pretty mouth baby.&rdquo; He groaned as he watched me purse my lips and run them over his cock. Planting sloppy kisses all over his tip.</p><p>&rdquo;I want your come.&rdquo; I moaned as I waited for him to spill inside my mouth. His abs flexed and I could tell he was close as he twitched in my hand.</p><p>&rdquo;I need your lips back on my cock.&rdquo; Harry growled and I playfully sucked at the tip of his cock before taking him back into my mouth.</p><p>&rdquo;Mmm.&rdquo; I moaned with his cock inside my mouth. The sooner he came, the sooner he could get the fuck out of here. It was fun while it lasted but I just had the best orgasm of my life and it turns out I don&rsquo;t need him anymore.</p><p>&rdquo;God, I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; Harry released a husky growl as I kept sucking around him. He spilled inside me and I swallowed every little droplet.</p><p>&rdquo;Well that was fun, you know where the door is.&rdquo; I said as I sat down normally on the couch.</p><p>&rdquo;Wait, we&rsquo;re not gonna talk about things?&rdquo; Harry asked as he looked at me confused while I wiped my lips with my hand.</p><p>&rdquo;Nope.&rdquo; I smiled politely. &rdquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that being single is way more fun.&rdquo; I said as I looked up at him with a grin on my lips. I guess this was my revenge. Now that he knows what he&rsquo;s missing out on, he&rsquo;s never gonna forget me.</p><p>&rdquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Harry looked at me like I was insane.</p><p>&rdquo;Feel free to close the door behind you.&rdquo; I said as I watched him get dressed.</p><p>&rdquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Harry called back as he walked towards the door and a few seconds later, the door slammed shut.</p><p>&rdquo;You are cruel Coco.&rdquo; Shawn laughed as he sat down next to me on the couch. &rdquo;Remind me to not ever mess with you eh.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; I laughed as I looked over at Shawn. &rdquo;Wanna go for another round?&rdquo;</p><p><b>If you like this leave a reblog.</b></p><p><i><a href=\"http://stylesbabygirls.tumblr.com/post/137082586146/masterlist-enjoy-the-endless-smut-do-not-repost\" target=\"_blank\">Masterlist</a></i></p>",
