Also on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/8806564/chapters/37255835\">AO3</a>.</p><p>\u00a0<i>\u201cDear Sansa, I hope this letter finds you and\nyour children well. I have written several times already, but with the whole of\nWesteros in the grip of Winter, the ravens might not have reached you. The\nlatest message I received from you was the news about the Riverlands. I was\nglad to hear that Hoster Tully has reached Winterfell. I am convinced that you\nwill be an excellent warden for him. I suspect that you have written since, but\nno raven reached us here in the Vale.</i></p><p><i>My health has not been the best of late,\nalthough I try to keep quiet about it. The medicine I take is highly\nrecommended by my new Maester Rhyswont, so I still have hope that my health\nimproves. My old Maester Colemon has died of a sudden fever and my conditions\nhas worsened since that. With the war in the South decided for Daenerys, my\nknights worry that we will have to face another threat from the South soon. Harold\nHardyng, my beloved and trusted heir, is sceptical about your need for our\nknights. Even though several men have told him about the abominations they met\nnorth of the Wall, he refuses to believe. Therefore, I send him to Winterfell\ntogether with Maester Rhyswont, who is also a sceptic. I want him to judge the\nsituation on his own. If anything happens to me I want my heir to honour our\nalliance. This is the fourth message I\u2019ve sent to you and it might be, that by\nthe time it reaches you, Harold is already close to Winterfell. Robin Arryn, Warden\nof the East.\u201d</i></p><!-- more --><p>Jon read it\nout loud. When he had received the letter his first thought was that Sansa\nwould help him steering through the troubled waters. Jon had the feeling that\nthere was more to this letter than met the eye. Sansa knew her cousin. It was\nonly when he had finished reading out the letter loudly and asked Sansa what it\nall meant that he realised that Sansa shook her head in an almost inperceptible\nway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d\nbetter discuss this in the council,\u201d Sansa said at the same time as Gilly\nexclaimed loudly: \u201cMaester Rhyswont!\u201d</p><p>Jon was\ndistracted by Gilly\u2019s face which was a grimace of distaste. </p><p>\u201cWhat about\nMaester Rhyswont?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Gilly\ncombed Podrick\u2019s hair with determination which earned her a high-pitched yelp,\nwhen the comb did not run through his hair smoothly. </p><p>\u201cMaester\nRhyswont is a very good maester, but he treats women like they are all\ndumbwits. He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.\u201d Gilly grumbled. </p><p>\u201cHe is a\ngood healer though.\u201d, she admitted. \u201cHe left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIf he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?\u201d, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter. There was a frown on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\nsent the raven from the Vale, if he was already on his way here?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cRobin\nmight have someone at hand who is capable to tend the ravens.\u201d Sansa stretched\nout her hand and Jon handed her the letter.</p><p>\u201cThis\nletter is from Robin,\u201d she confirmed, fingering Robin\u2019s signature. </p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou make of it?\u201d Jon wanted to know.</p><p>Sansa\nsighed. \u201cWe really should discuss this in council,\u201d she chided him, but\nrelented when she saw his face. His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin\u2019s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.\u201d\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nlike this,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe calls this Harold his \u2018beleoved and trusted\u2019\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.\u201d</p><p><i>The alliance. The alliance he wants honoured.</i> Jon felt a cold fear clutch at his\nheart. He knew how alliances were forged and he did not like it. Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa\u2019s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she\u2019ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa\u2019s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger\u2019s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon\u2019s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>\u201cI do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cIt also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.\u201d She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cApparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger\u2019s ward\u201d, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa\u2019s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>\u201cSo many\nravens lost worries me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.\u201d</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She\u2019s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon\u2019s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>\u201cWe should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.\u201d Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot\noutright deny him,\u201d Jon answered. \u201cNot before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.\u201d <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\ncan detain him. It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again. I must be more careful.</i></p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to avoid that. With the gods staying silent, I feel there is great danger\nhere in Winterfell. \u2018Stay alert\u2019 they said. No order about going North.\u201d <i>\u2018Stay alert. Stay steadfast\u2019.</i> Jon did\nnot want to leave again.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\nis worrying. I really wish they had been clearer about that.\u201d Sansa agreed.</p><p>Suddenly\nshe laughed. </p><p>\u201cThe best\nway to detain him would probably be to avoid that he even asks the question,\u201d\nshe finally said, when she had contained her mirth.</p><p>\u201cYou just\nhave to pretend that you don\u2019t understand his question at all. Keep yourself\nbusy, keep bannermen around you. And I\u2019ll be very carefuly that he doesn\u2019t\ncatch me alone either.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes\nglinted with amusement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it\nwas a good idea, that you brought this here. I\u2019m sure we can spread the word,\nthat people have to keep us busy.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled.\nThe scheme did appeal to him, but it would mean less time alone with Sansa. Not\nthat they had had much of this lately. <i>I\nguess, if I want some time alone, I have to catch nits again.</i></p><p>\u201cI still\nwould like to have an edge. I don\u2019t trust this Harold already. If you read\nRobin\u2019s letter right, he might be very dangerous in his ambition.\u201d</p><p>Jon let his\neyes wander around the room, fully taking in the persons in the room for the\nfirst time.</p><p>His gaze\nwent back to Lady Alys. He narrowed his eyes. <i>The Gods told me that she is like my sister. I should trust her.</i></p><p>\u201cLady Alys,\nthere is a great opportunity to prove your loyalty\u201d he addressed her. </p><p>Alys looked\nup, her face curious in a way that did remind him of his sister Arya and\nshortly made his heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nhow to fight, but you have not yet a reputation like Lady Brienne has.\u201d Alys\nmade a face as if she had an idea what Jon was about to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave you\nwritten to Robin about Alys?\u201d Jon asked Sansa. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou could\nbe the new court lady of Lady Sansa, dagger hidden in your dress, just in case.\nIt would comfort me to know that somebody is around Lady Sansa, in case this\nHarold forgets himself.\u201d</p><p>Alys\u2019 face\nfell. \u201cA dress?\u201d, she exclaimed, misery plain on her face.</p><p>Jon\ngrinned. \u201cA dress.

Jon had the feeling that\nthere was more to this letter than met the eye. Sansa knew her cousin. It was\nonly when he had finished reading out the letter loudly and asked Sansa what it\nall meant that he realised that Sansa shook her head in an almost inperceptible\nway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d\nbetter discuss this in the council,\u201d Sansa said at the same time as Gilly\nexclaimed loudly: \u201cMaester Rhyswont!\u201d</p><p>Jon was\ndistracted by Gilly\u2019s face which was a grimace of distaste. </p><p>\u201cWhat about\nMaester Rhyswont?\u201d he asked. </p><p>Gilly\ncombed Podrick\u2019s hair with determination which earned her a high-pitched yelp,\nwhen the comb did not run through his hair smoothly. </p><p>\u201cMaester\nRhyswont is a very good maester, but he treats women like they are all\ndumbwits. He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.\u201d Gilly grumbled. </p><p>\u201cHe is a\ngood healer though.\u201d, she admitted. \u201cHe left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.\u201d. </p><p>\u201cIf he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?\u201d, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter. There was a frown on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\nsent the raven from the Vale, if he was already on his way here?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cRobin\nmight have someone at hand who is capable to tend the ravens.\u201d Sansa stretched\nout her hand and Jon handed her the letter.</p><p>\u201cThis\nletter is from Robin,\u201d she confirmed, fingering Robin\u2019s signature. </p><p>\u201cWhat do\nyou make of it?\u201d Jon wanted to know.</p><p>Sansa\nsighed. \u201cWe really should discuss this in council,\u201d she chided him, but\nrelented when she saw his face. His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin\u2019s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.\u201d\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cI do not\nlike this,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe calls this Harold his \u2018beleoved and trusted\u2019\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.\u201d</p><p><i>The alliance. The alliance he wants honoured.</i> Jon felt a cold fear clutch at his\nheart. He knew how alliances were forged and he did not like it. Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa\u2019s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she\u2019ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa\u2019s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger\u2019s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon\u2019s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>\u201cI do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.\u201d She paused.</p><p>\u201cIt also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.\u201d She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>\u201cApparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger\u2019s ward\u201d, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa\u2019s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>\u201cSo many\nravens lost worries me,\u201d Sansa said. \u201cI\u2019ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.\u201d</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She\u2019s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon\u2019s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>\u201cWe should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.\u201d Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon\u2019s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot\noutright deny him,\u201d Jon answered. \u201cNot before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.\u201d <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\ncan detain him. It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again. I must be more careful.</i></p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to avoid that. With the gods staying silent, I feel there is great danger\nhere in Winterfell. \u2018Stay alert\u2019 they said. No order about going North.\u201d <i>\u2018Stay alert. Stay steadfast\u2019.</i> Jon did\nnot want to leave again.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\nis worrying. I really wish they had been clearer about that.\u201d Sansa agreed.</p><p>Suddenly\nshe laughed. </p><p>\u201cThe best\nway to detain him would probably be to avoid that he even asks the question,\u201d\nshe finally said, when she had contained her mirth.</p><p>\u201cYou just\nhave to pretend that you don\u2019t understand his question at all. Keep yourself\nbusy, keep bannermen around you. And I\u2019ll be very carefuly that he doesn\u2019t\ncatch me alone either.\u201d </p><p>Her eyes\nglinted with amusement. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it\nwas a good idea, that you brought this here. I\u2019m sure we can spread the word,\nthat people have to keep us busy.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled.\nThe scheme did appeal to him, but it would mean less time alone with Sansa. Not\nthat they had had much of this lately. <i>I\nguess, if I want some time alone, I have to catch nits again.</i></p><p>\u201cI still\nwould like to have an edge. I don\u2019t trust this Harold already. If you read\nRobin\u2019s letter right, he might be very dangerous in his ambition.\u201d</p><p>Jon let his\neyes wander around the room, fully taking in the persons in the room for the\nfirst time.</p><p>His gaze\nwent back to Lady Alys. He narrowed his eyes. <i>The Gods told me that she is like my sister. I should trust her.</i></p><p>\u201cLady Alys,\nthere is a great opportunity to prove your loyalty\u201d he addressed her. </p><p>Alys looked\nup, her face curious in a way that did remind him of his sister Arya and\nshortly made his heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nhow to fight, but you have not yet a reputation like Lady Brienne has.\u201d Alys\nmade a face as if she had an idea what Jon was about to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave you\nwritten to Robin about Alys?\u201d Jon asked Sansa. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou could\nbe the new court lady of Lady Sansa, dagger hidden in your dress, just in case.\nIt would comfort me to know that somebody is around Lady Sansa, in case this\nHarold forgets himself.\u201d</p><p>Alys\u2019 face\nfell. \u201cA dress?\u201d, she exclaimed, misery plain on her face.</p><p>Jon\ngrinned. \u201cA dress. You would only need to do this for as long as this Harold\nHardyng is here.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help himself. His voice already betrayed his\ndislike for a man he had never met. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d\nSansa interrupted him. \u201cYou cannot possibly order Lady Alys to do that.

It might mean that you\u2019ll have to go to the Wall again to show\nhim proof.\u201d</p><p>Jon felt\nblood rush in his face. It filled him with grim satisfaction that there was no\nquestion for Sansa, that she would not want to marry this Harold, but he also\nrealised that he might have given away some of his feelings to others. <i>Again. I must be more careful.</i></p><p>\u201cI would\nlike to avoid that. With the gods staying silent, I feel there is great danger\nhere in Winterfell. \u2018Stay alert\u2019 they said. No order about going North.\u201d <i>\u2018Stay alert. Stay steadfast\u2019.</i> Jon did\nnot want to leave again.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\nis worrying. I really wish they had been clearer about that.\u201d Sansa agreed.</p><p>Suddenly\nshe laughed. </p><p>\u201cThe best\nway to detain him would probably be to avoid that he even asks the question,\u201d\nshe finally said, when she had contained her mirth.</p><p>\u201cYou just\nhave to pretend that you don\u2019t understand his question at all. Keep yourself\nbusy, keep bannermen around you.

I\u2019m sure we can spread the word,\nthat people have to keep us busy.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled.\nThe scheme did appeal to him, but it would mean less time alone with Sansa. Not\nthat they had had much of this lately. <i>I\nguess, if I want some time alone, I have to catch nits again.</i></p><p>\u201cI still\nwould like to have an edge. I don\u2019t trust this Harold already. If you read\nRobin\u2019s letter right, he might be very dangerous in his ambition.\u201d</p><p>Jon let his\neyes wander around the room, fully taking in the persons in the room for the\nfirst time.</p><p>His gaze\nwent back to Lady Alys. He narrowed his eyes. <i>The Gods told me that she is like my sister. I should trust her.</i></p><p>\u201cLady Alys,\nthere is a great opportunity to prove your loyalty\u201d he addressed her. </p><p>Alys looked\nup, her face curious in a way that did remind him of his sister Arya and\nshortly made his heart ache.</p><p>\u201cYou know\nhow to fight, but you have not yet a reputation like Lady Brienne has.\u201d Alys\nmade a face as if she had an idea what Jon was about to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave you\nwritten to Robin about Alys?\u201d Jon asked Sansa. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou could\nbe the new court lady of Lady Sansa, dagger hidden in your dress, just in case.\nIt would comfort me to know that somebody is around Lady Sansa, in case this\nHarold forgets himself.\u201d</p><p>Alys\u2019 face\nfell. \u201cA dress?\u201d, she exclaimed, misery plain on her face.</p><p>Jon\ngrinned. \u201cA dress.

I have written several times already, but with the whole of\nWesteros in the grip of Winter, the ravens might not have reached you. The\nlatest message I received from you was the news about the Riverlands. I was\nglad to hear that Hoster Tully has reached Winterfell. I am convinced that you\nwill be an excellent warden for him. I suspect that you have written since, but\nno raven reached us here in the Vale.</i></p><p><i>My health has not been the best of late,\nalthough I try to keep quiet about it. The medicine I take is highly\nrecommended by my new Maester Rhyswont, so I still have hope that my health\nimproves. My old Maester Colemon has died of a sudden fever and my conditions\nhas worsened since that. With the war in the South decided for Daenerys, my\nknights worry that we will have to face another threat from the South soon. Harold\nHardyng, my beloved and trusted heir, is sceptical about your need for our\nknights. Even though several men have told him about the abominations they met\nnorth of the Wall, he refuses to believe. Therefore, I send him to Winterfell\ntogether with Maester Rhyswont, who is also a sceptic. I want him to judge the\nsituation on his own. If anything happens to me I want my heir to honour our\nalliance. This is the fourth message I&rsquo;ve sent to you and it might be, that by\nthe time it reaches you, Harold is already close to Winterfell. Robin Arryn, Warden\nof the East.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon read it\nout loud. When he had received the letter his first thought was that Sansa\nwould help him steering through the troubled waters. Jon had the feeling that\nthere was more to this letter than met the eye. Sansa knew her cousin. It was\nonly when he had finished reading out the letter loudly and asked Sansa what it\nall meant that he realised that Sansa shook her head in an almost inperceptible\nway.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d\nbetter discuss this in the council,&rdquo; Sansa said at the same time as Gilly\nexclaimed loudly: &ldquo;Maester Rhyswont!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon was\ndistracted by Gilly&rsquo;s face which was a grimace of distaste. </p><p>&ldquo;What about\nMaester Rhyswont?&rdquo; he asked. </p><p>Gilly\ncombed Podrick&rsquo;s hair with determination which earned her a high-pitched yelp,\nwhen the comb did not run through his hair smoothly. </p><p>&ldquo;Maester\nRhyswont is a very good maester, but he treats women like they are all\ndumbwits. He was one of the few who would protest against me sitting quietly in\nthe back of the classes to listen.&rdquo; Gilly grumbled. </p><p>&ldquo;He is a\ngood healer though.&rdquo;, she admitted. &ldquo;He left shortly before we made our way\nNorth.&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;If he is a\ngood healer why does Lord Robin send him North though?&rdquo;, Sansa mused, voicing\none of the oddities of the letter. There was a frown on her forehead.</p><p>&ldquo;And who\nsent the raven from the Vale, if he was already on his way here?&rdquo; Jon asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Robin\nmight have someone at hand who is capable to tend the ravens.&rdquo; Sansa stretched\nout her hand and Jon handed her the letter.</p><p>&ldquo;This\nletter is from Robin,&rdquo; she confirmed, fingering Robin&rsquo;s signature. </p><p>&ldquo;What do\nyou make of it?&rdquo; Jon wanted to know.</p><p>Sansa\nsighed. &ldquo;We really should discuss this in council,&rdquo; she chided him, but\nrelented when she saw his face. His anxiousness which had nothing to do with\nMaester Rhyswont or Lord Robin&rsquo;s health must have been visible on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;It is odd,\nthat Robin mentions the new medicine. I would say, that he suspects that it is\nnot good for his health at all and he wants the Maester away to test this.&rdquo;\nSansa looked at the nitcomb absentmindedly.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not\nlike this,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;He calls this Harold his &lsquo;beleoved and trusted&rsquo;\nheir. Why trust him, if he is sceptic about the White Walkers and the\nconditions of our alliance.&rdquo;</p><p><i>The alliance. The alliance he wants honoured.</i> Jon felt a cold fear clutch at his\nheart. He knew how alliances were forged and he did not like it. Not at all. <i>Harold comes as a suitor for Sansa&rsquo;s hand. </i>He\nlooked down at his hand that shook with anger at the thought and tried to get\nhis temper in hand. <i>Sansa will not leave\nWinterfell, she&rsquo;ll stay here with me.</i> He wished he could feel secure about\nthis. <i>What will she do, if this Harold\nsets conditions for the troops from the Vale. What if Robin dies?</i> Jon had\nnever met Sansa&rsquo;s cousin and Sansa had told him that the sickly Robin was not\neasy to deal with, but he was fond of his cousin and Jon knew that it was only\ndue to this fondness that Robin had refrained from revenging Littlefinger&rsquo;s\ndeath. He had been a good ally over three years, and the Vale had bled in the\ncontinuous war against the Walkers like the North had.</p><p>Sansa\nseemed to feel Jon&rsquo;s eyes on her and tried a reassuring smile. </p><p>&ldquo;I do think\nhe wants us to assess this Maester Rhyswont and his heir. It is a prudent move.\nLet the sceptic learn something about our war, remove the Maester in case he is\nbehind his worsened health, and remove his heir who might be overly ambitions.\nIf I read this letter right, Robin had to appease a hostile fraction at his\ncourt.&rdquo; She paused.</p><p>&ldquo;It also\nmeans he trust us to convince that fraction and help him.&rdquo; She looked at the\ncomb in her hands again and then raised her face to him. Her blue eyes met his.</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently\nhe did learn some things while he was Littlefinger&rsquo;s ward&rdquo;, Jon tried to\ndistract some of the tension with a joke.</p><p>The corner\nof Sansa&rsquo;s mouth only quirked lightly. </p><p>&ldquo;So many\nravens lost worries me,&rdquo; Sansa said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written twice while you were at the\nwall. It could be an accident of course.&rdquo;</p><p>She\nconcentrated on her comb again. <i>She&rsquo;s\navoiding looking at me.</i> Jon&rsquo;s heart felt like a lump in his chest. He had\nhoped that he was mistaken about the message of the last sentence.</p><p>There was\nan uncomfortable silence. Jon could feel the blood rushing in his ears. <i>I should not have come, I should have\nwaited. </i></p><p>&ldquo;We should\ndecide on what our answer will be, if that Harold wants to marry me.&rdquo; Sansa\nsaid in an almost whisper. She looked up again and this time she held Jon&rsquo;s\ngaze.</p><p>His heart\nmade an odd jump.<i> Our answer.</i> He felt\nas if Sansa and he were the only people in the room. He did not see any of the\nothers in the room, just Sansa.</p><p>&ldquo;We cannot\noutright deny him,&rdquo; Jon answered. &ldquo;Not before he has pledged to fight with us\nagainst the Walkers.&rdquo; <i>I could always just\nchop off his head. </i>That dark thought came unbidden and Jon shuddered involuntarily.</p><p>&ldquo;No, but we\ncan detain him.
