I\nknow humans gets pruney but I figured if I let him nap for half an\nhour at least he\u2019d be fresh and whatever aches he was having would\nbe taken care of by the heat,\u201d Cody stroked his thumb over the\nginger\u2019s forehead. \u201cAnd I made sure he wouldn\u2019t drown.\u201d He\nadded.</p><p>Pausing\nat that, Anakin slowly nodded before sitting down. \u201cI\u2019d like to\ntalk with him so you can go Commander\u2026 I\u2019ll look after him.\u201d He\nadded quietly when the trooper looked concerned.</p><p>Uncertain,\nCody slowly nodded and stood, pulling the rest of the bodysuit on\nrather slowly in Anakin\u2019s opinion before he left.</p><p>Then\nit was only him and Obi-Wan.</p><p>Who\nwas sliding down.</p><p>Quickly\nAnakin reached out and cupped the back of the others head, tilting it\nback just as Cody had done which stopped Obi-Wan from sliding,\nsmiling\nwryly at the top of the others eye. \u201cHonestly Obi\u2026 weren\u2019t you\nthe one always telling me not to sleep in a bath?\u201d He mumbled\nfondly to himself before settling in to wait, watching the steam\nrising off the water.</p><p>Minutes\nticked by and he was about to shake the other awake when Obi-Wan\nshifted and sat up, mumbling a bit as Anakin let go of his forehead.\n\u201cGuh Cody, I told you not to-\u201d He went mute, blinking up at\nAnakin. \u201cYou\u2019re not Cody.\u201d He muttered.</p><p>Glancing\ndown at himself and then looking back at Obi-Wan, Anakin grinned. \u201cI\nrather think not.\u201d He said cheerfully, watching as Obi-Wan rubbed\nhis face with his pruney hands before pulling himself out of the\nhotspring, uncaring if Anakin saw him naked.</p><p>They\u2019d\nseen each other in the buff to many times to count honestly. \u201cCody\nfigured he\u2019d let you sleep some, I came and\u2026 well I told him I\nwanted to talk with you.\u201d Anakin volunteered as Obi-Wan pulled over\na towel.</p><p>He\npaused at Anakin\u2019s words though and then nodded, wrapping it around\nhimself. \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Obi-Wan murmured warily.</p><p>\u2018I\nput that expression on his face.\u2019 Anakin swallowed before smiling\nweakly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Obi-Wan. I don\u2019t know why I seemed to think\nprotecting the Chancellor\u2019s reputation was more important than\u2026\nwell you. The things I <i>know</i>\nhappen to Jedi all the time. And I did some research too.\u201d He added\nquietly, looking down at his knees.</p><p>There\nwas a pause and then Obi-Wan settled his hand on Anakin\u2019s knee.\n\u201cWhat did you find Anakin?\u201d He murmured, squeezing his knee.</p><p>\u201c\u2026The\nSlavery Ring prohibition act.\u201d Anakin swallowed heavily and looked up\nat the other through his bangs.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d\nThe older Jedi murmured in sad understanding before sighing deeply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the earliest ones\u2026 and for the record Anakin,\nthank you for apologizing.\u201d Obi-Wan smiled at him</p><p>Smiling\nweakly in return, Anakin rubbed the back of his head again. \u201cI\njust\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do, what to say. I trust\u2026 trusted\nhim?\u201d Anakin swallowed heavily and rubbed his face with both hands,\nscrubbing hard enough for his mech hand to hurt the delicate flesh\nthrough his leather glove but it made him feel human to hurt, made\nhim focus on the moment for a little bit.</p><p>The\nhand on his knee squeezed again and he peeked through his fingers,\nwatching Obi-Wan\u2019s serious expression. \u201cAnakin, I know he\u2019s\nbeen there since you were a child but\u2026 I have something to confess\u2026\nback when you were my very young padawan he used his leverage to have\nyou sent to his office. To advice you as he said\u2026\u201d He murmured\nquietly.</p><p>Blinking,\ndropping his hands to his thighs, Anakin stared at the other. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging,\nObi-Wan stared at him in return. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Back then I was\nso worried it was for\u2026 that he was <i>interested</i>\nin you.\u201d He said meaningfully.</p><p>Brows\nbunching up, it took Anakin a moment and then he went pale. \u201cNo! No\nhe never\u2026 ugh gross Obi-Wan.\u201d He groaned as Obi-Wan shrugged,\nsmiling weakly.</p><p>\u201cAt\nthe time I didn\u2019t understand why he had a young padawan sent to\nhim. It was the only thing that really made sense to his particular\ninterest in you so I kept taking you to the healers after you\u2019d been to his office but you were never hurt when you came back. I mean\u2026 you were a young child back then, teen\u2026\nit just didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He shrugged awkwardly.</p><p>Frowning,\nAnakin bit his lips as he put himself in Obi-Wan\u2019s situation back\nthen\u2026 and Ahsoka in young Anakin\u2019s position.</p><p>\u2018I\nhave so many questions now.\u2019 He thought weakly as Obi-Wan finished\ndrying off.</p>",

I\nknow humans gets pruney but I figured if I let him nap for half an\nhour at least he\u2019d be fresh and whatever aches he was having would\nbe taken care of by the heat,\u201d Cody stroked his thumb over the\nginger\u2019s forehead. \u201cAnd I made sure he wouldn\u2019t drown.\u201d He\nadded.</p><p>Pausing\nat that, Anakin slowly nodded before sitting down. \u201cI\u2019d like to\ntalk with him so you can go Commander\u2026 I\u2019ll look after him.\u201d He\nadded quietly when the trooper looked concerned.</p><p>Uncertain,\nCody slowly nodded and stood, pulling the rest of the bodysuit on\nrather slowly in Anakin\u2019s opinion before he left.</p><p>Then\nit was only him and Obi-Wan.</p><p>Who\nwas sliding down.</p><p>Quickly\nAnakin reached out and cupped the back of the others head, tilting it\nback just as Cody had done which stopped Obi-Wan from sliding,\nsmiling\nwryly at the top of the others eye. \u201cHonestly Obi\u2026 weren\u2019t you\nthe one always telling me not to sleep in a bath?\u201d He mumbled\nfondly to himself before settling in to wait, watching the steam\nrising off the water.</p><p>Minutes\nticked by and he was about to shake the other awake when Obi-Wan\nshifted and sat up, mumbling a bit as Anakin let go of his forehead.\n\u201cGuh Cody, I told you not to-\u201d He went mute, blinking up at\nAnakin. \u201cYou\u2019re not Cody.\u201d He muttered.</p><p>Glancing\ndown at himself and then looking back at Obi-Wan, Anakin grinned. \u201cI\nrather think not.\u201d He said cheerfully, watching as Obi-Wan rubbed\nhis face with his pruney hands before pulling himself out of the\nhotspring, uncaring if Anakin saw him naked.</p><p>They\u2019d\nseen each other in the buff to many times to count honestly. \u201cCody\nfigured he\u2019d let you sleep some, I came and\u2026 well I told him I\nwanted to talk with you.\u201d Anakin volunteered as Obi-Wan pulled over\na towel.</p><p>He\npaused at Anakin\u2019s words though and then nodded, wrapping it around\nhimself. \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Obi-Wan murmured warily.</p><p>\u2018I\nput that expression on his face.\u2019 Anakin swallowed before smiling\nweakly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Obi-Wan. I don\u2019t know why I seemed to think\nprotecting the Chancellor\u2019s reputation was more important than\u2026\nwell you. The things I <i>know</i>\nhappen to Jedi all the time. And I did some research too.\u201d He added\nquietly, looking down at his knees.</p><p>There\nwas a pause and then Obi-Wan settled his hand on Anakin\u2019s knee.\n\u201cWhat did you find Anakin?\u201d He murmured, squeezing his knee.</p><p>\u201c\u2026The\nSlavery Ring prohibition act.\u201d Anakin swallowed heavily and looked up\nat the other through his bangs.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d\nThe older Jedi murmured in sad understanding before sighing deeply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the earliest ones\u2026 and for the record Anakin,\nthank you for apologizing.\u201d Obi-Wan smiled at him</p><p>Smiling\nweakly in return, Anakin rubbed the back of his head again. \u201cI\njust\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to do, what to say. I trust\u2026 trusted\nhim?\u201d Anakin swallowed heavily and rubbed his face with both hands,\nscrubbing hard enough for his mech hand to hurt the delicate flesh\nthrough his leather glove but it made him feel human to hurt, made\nhim focus on the moment for a little bit.</p><p>The\nhand on his knee squeezed again and he peeked through his fingers,\nwatching Obi-Wan\u2019s serious expression. \u201cAnakin, I know he\u2019s\nbeen there since you were a child but\u2026 I have something to confess\u2026\nback when you were my very young padawan he used his leverage to have\nyou sent to his office. To advice you as he said\u2026\u201d He murmured\nquietly.</p><p>Blinking,\ndropping his hands to his thighs, Anakin stared at the other. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging,\nObi-Wan stared at him in return. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Back then I was\nso worried it was for\u2026 that he was <i>interested</i>\nin you.\u201d He said meaningfully.</p><p>Brows\nbunching up, it took Anakin a moment and then he went pale. \u201cNo! No\nhe never\u2026 ugh gross Obi-Wan.\u201d He groaned as Obi-Wan shrugged,\nsmiling weakly.</p><p>\u201cAt\nthe time I didn\u2019t understand why he had a young padawan sent to\nhim. It was the only thing that really made sense to his particular\ninterest in you so I kept taking you to the healers after you\u2019d been to his office but you were never hurt when you came back. I mean\u2026 you were a young child back then, teen\u2026\nit just didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He shrugged awkwardly.</p><p>Frowning,\nAnakin bit his lips as he put himself in Obi-Wan\u2019s situation back\nthen\u2026 and Ahsoka in young Anakin\u2019s position.</p><p>\u2018I\nhave so many questions now.\u2019 He thought weakly as Obi-Wan finished\ndrying off.</p>",
