If you see any mistakes feel free to tell me!))</p><p>TJ\u2019s favorite shifts in the flower shop are the afternoon ones. The owner is usually out and about, which means that he can do whatever he wants when there are no clients in the shop, the golden light of the setting sun enters through the big windows, and the shop smells like jasmine flowers and soil from the newly potted plants.</p><p>It\u2019s practically heaven on earth, while the morning shifts are a lot busier, his boss usually makes him run errands and deliver orders, and it also means that he has to deal with Buffy working the same shift.</p><p>So there has to be a reason as to why he has changed all his shifts to the morning, right?</p><!-- more --><p>-</p><p>\u201cTJ, stop looking through the window and help me with this, for God\u2019s sake\u201d</p><p>TJ snaps out of his trance and grabs one of the bags full of potting soil that Buffy is carrying with difficulty from the backroom.</p><p>\u201cAre you losing strength, Driscoll?\u201d he smirks, leaving the bag on the table and starting to organize the different flowers they have to plant.</p><p>Buffys scoffs and doesn\u2019t even try to dignify that question with a response. She starts filling up the pots with potting soil skillfully, not even looking at him.</p><p>Buffy and TJ, they have a weird relationship. They had a bad start, Buffy tolerating no bullshit and TJ being a little shit sometimes, but they have managed to make peace and somehow bond over shared interests. They are not the best of friends, and their relationship consists of making fun of each other most of the time, but they make it work.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it would be nice if you stopped acting like a wife waiting for his husband to return from war and worked sometime\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting like anything\u201d TJ says, not as eloquently as he would have liked. Buffy stops what she was doing to look at him with an eyebrow raised. TJ just rolls his eyes and starts filling flowerpots, a lot less gracefully than Buffy.</p><p>\u201cSure\u201d she says, shrugging. Then, TJ can see a devilish smile appear on her face \u201cThat is why you keep looking at the door with longing\u201d</p><p>TJ shakes his head, pointedly not looking at Buffy \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you blushing like a peony every time that guy comes by\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, blushing like a peony?\u201d TJ says, removing one lily from the flowerpot with a little too much force \u201cNice choice of words, very fitting\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are deflecting\u201d Buffy points at him \u201cAnd try not to kill the plants, you brute\u201d</p><p>TJ huffs. Of course he is deflecting. The last thing he needs is Buffy making fun of him for his obvious crush on the cute boy that comes by some mornings to buy flowers.</p><p>He is the reason he has changed all of his shifts, he had to make sure that he had an opportunity to see him again.</p><p>Not that it matters. Every time the guy looks at him he leaves TJ like a stuttering, blushing mess, and he doesn\u2019t dare to talk to him more than the necessary in case he makes an idiot of himself.</p><p>Don\u2019t judge him, it\u2019s not his fault that the guy is cute, and polite and really well-dressed. He has these really big brown eyes, and a shy smile that could light up a room, and he always wears cardigans and asks him how he is doing before asking for the flowers he wants.</p><p>Of course TJ is crushing hard on him. Come on, who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cYou still here, TJ?\u201d Buffy waves a hand in front of his face</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d TJ lets go of the plant that he has been holding for a while and cleans his hand on his apron.</p><p>Buffy looks at him, exasperated, but her face changes suddenly to an expression that TJ is incapable to read.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she says, taking off her apron \u201cI think I\u2019m taking my break now\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, and gesticulates to all the plants and flowers that they still have to plant out \u201cAnd you are leaving me with all of this?\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugs, a little smile dangling on her lips \u201cYou\u2019ll live, Kippen\u201d</p><p>And TJ, eyes wide with incredulity, sees her hang her apron, open the door and just leave like that. He can\u2019t believe that she would leave him with all the work to go flirt with the bakery guy. Because that\u2019s where she is going. Buffy knows it, TJ knows it, even Marty, the guy from the bakery, knows it.</p><p>He clicks his tongue loudly, thinking about how he will get revenge for this, when the bell over the door rings again. TJ turns around.</p><p>It\u2019s the cute boy.</p><p>\u201cHi, good morning\u201d he says, stepping into the shop \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>In TJ\u2019s defense, he thought Buffy had forgotten something and was the one entering the shop, so he had a pretty snarky remark on the tip of his tongue. He didn\u2019t expect cute boy.</p><p>TJ fumbles with the pot he was holding, nearly letting it fall from his hands. Finally, he places it in the table, trying his best to act natural.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d TJ says, cleaning his hands on his apron nervously. His voice sounds really high-pitched and he cringes internally \u201cHow, eh, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t even know if I want a bouquet or a potted flower, to be honest\u201d Cute guy says, smiling warmly at him \u201cAny recommendation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could fix you a bouquet with the camellias we\u2019ve received this morning\u201d TJ says, and gestures to at all the potted plants they have currently on the shop \u201cAnd we have all of these and also primroses on the back\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you\u201d</p><p>His voice is barely a whisper, but TJ turns around at the speed of light. Did he just say what he has heard? He feels his face warm up, and he is sure that he looks as red as the roses they have outside the shop.</p><p>\u201cThe meaning\u201d Cute guy says, eyes widening. His face has started to redden too and he is avoiding his eyes. \u201cThe meaning of primroses is `I can\u2019t live without you\u00b4. You know, the language of flowers and, well- eh, yeah\u201d</p><p>TJ heart rate starts slowing down again \u201cOh, yes, of course\u201d</p><p>God, he is so stupid. He seriously needs to stop acting like a middle-schooler with a crush. He is supposed to be an adult.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take one of the primroses\u201d Cute guy says quickly, still avoiding looking at him.</p><p>TJ just nods, heading to the backroom where they have all the primroses potted to look for one to give to Cute guy. He really needs to stop calling him Cute guy, but it\u2019s not like he knows his name. He could ask, sure, but TJ doesn\u2019t trust himself enough for that, he would mess it up somehow.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this one?\u201d TJ shows him one of the flowers they have in the back. They are actually quite beautiful and well maintained, Buffy has done a good job with them.</p><p>Cute guy nods, and the next transactions are all done in silence. While he pays, TJ is trying his best to come up with something to say, something that won\u2019t sound awkward, but his brain is not collaborating.</p><p>When TJ gives him his change, their hands brush and TJ could swear that cute guy blushed a little bit, but he is quick to grab his plant and head to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Cute guy says, while opening the door \u201cHave a nice day\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too\u201d it\u2019s the only thing that TJ manages to say before the door closes.</p><p>He throws himself on the chair behind the cash register and hides his face on his hands. God, why is he incapable to have a normal conversation with a cute guy. He could have asked his name, he could have flirted a little, but no, the only thing he did was blush like a kid with a crush.</p><p>The bell over the door chimes again, and TJ looks in between his fingers. Buffy stands in front of him, at the other side of the cash register.</p><p>\u201cI guess it didn\u2019t go well?\u201d</p><p>TJ just groans, letting his head fall on the counter with a loud thud.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ is regretting a lot changing all of his shifts to the morning. First of all, because he blowed any chance he had with Cute guy, and second of all, because he has been running errands and delivering orders to the customers all morning and he is exhausted.</p><p>His feet are aching and he can barely see where he is going because he is carrying a giant flowerpot full of yellow tulips.</p><p>He stops in front of a tattoo parlor, thankfully not far from the flower shop, and sets the pot down on the sidewalk. The windows of the place are tinted, making it hard for him to see inside, and there is a big neon sign above the door that reads \u201cGHC\u201d, whatever that means. \u00a0According to google maps here is where he is supposed to deliver the flowers.\u00a0</p><p>He checks google again, confused. It doesn\u2019t look like the typical place where they usually deliver flowers, so he is starting to suspect that he might have the wrong address, but there is only one way to know.</p><p>He picks up the giant flowerpot again and rings the doorbell with his elbow. When the door opens he basically stumbles inside the tattoo parlor.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d A confused voice says, and in between the tulips TJ can see a girl with short hair looking at him \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in the wrong place\u201d TJ tries his best to hold the flowerpot with only one hand to be able to see the girl he is talking to but fails miserably \u201cThere\u2019s a Cyrus Goodman here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he works here\u201d She says, stepping forward. The girl takes the flowerpot from his hands and sets it down on the front counter.</p><p>\u201cHe asked for the flowers to be delivered here\u201d TJ runs a hand through his hair, trying to make it look at least decent. He pulls the pad of papers from his back pocket and leafs through it trying to find the correct one.</p><p>Then, a guy comes out from one of the rooms in the back where TJ supposes they tattoo people. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any tattoo, at least that TJ can see, but he is wearing a lot of piercings all around his face.</p><p>\u201cHey, are these Cyrus\u2019 flowers?\u201d he asks, and the girl nods in his direction. The guy with the piercings turns around and knocks the door of one of the rooms \u201cCy, your flowers are here\u201d</p><p>TJ rips the correct piece of paper and gives it to the girl \u201cIf you could sign here, please\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course\u201d The girl takes the paper and slips behind the front counter, scribbling her name down before passing it back to him.</p><p>TJ is ready to go when another guy coming out from one of the rooms in the back grabs his attention. TJ\u2019s heart skips a beat.</p><p>It\u2019s the cute guy from the shop. He is there, with his shy smile and his doe eyes, and only wearing a t-shirt instead of his usual cardigans. Which is a surprise, because it means TJ can see both his arms are full of tattoos.</p><p>TJ is pretty sure he looks like an idiot, standing there without saying anything, but his brain is short-circuiting and he can\u2019t stop looking at him, trying to reconcile the image he had of Cute-guy from the image of Also-cute-but-heavily-tattooed guy he has in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Cute guy says, stopping dead on his tracks. He looks at TJ, and a little smile grows on his lips \u201cHi\u201d</p><p>The piercing guy looks at both of them \u201cYou know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works on the flower shop\u201d Cute guy says. TJ should stop calling him cute guy in his mind, apparently he is called Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOh, he works in the flower shop?\u201d The girl says, with a particular inflection on her voice, like she is trying to imply something that TJ doesn\u2019t catch. Cyrus looks at her and they seem to maintain a silent conversation just with their eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou really go a lot to that flower shop\u201d The guy with the piercings says distractedly while looking through some papers.</p><p>\u201cThey have nice flowers, Jonah\u201d Cyrus says quickly, gesticulating with his gloved hands. Then he looks at TJ, apologetically \u201cI keep telling them, just because it\u2019s a tattoo parlor it doesn\u2019t need to be all black and gloomy, we are not goths, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nods, still completely speechless.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why I keep buying flowers and yours are really good and-\u201d Cyrus continues, and TJ is not sure if he is talking to him or that Jonah guy \u201cSorry, I\u2019m rambling\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay\u201d TJ says. He points lightly at the flowerpot in the front counter \u201cSo, are these the tulips you ordered?\u201d</p><p>TJ feels a little bit awkward standing there, with his jeans and his hoodie that look too plain in comparison to their clothes and with dirt under his nails that look totally out of place in the extremely clean parlor.</p><p>\u201cYes, yellow tulips\u201d Cyrus removes his gloves and steps towards the front counter to examine the flowers \u201cThank you so much for bringing this here\u201d</p><p>TJ can\u2019t take his eyes out of Cyrus\u2019 arms. His tattoos are beautiful. It\u2019s an intricate design of a flowers stretching across his arms, bursting with color. They are so detailed that he is sure that he could spend hours looking at them,</p><p>No wonder he knows about the language of flowers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d He finds himself asking, without really thinking \u201cThe yellow tulips\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looks back at him and smiles, warm and wide, making TJ\u2019s mouth go dry and the butterflies in his stomach start fluttering again.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t he know? He is the florist\u201d Jonah whispers, but the girl shushes him quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere is sunshine in your smile\u201d Cyrus says simply, ignoring his coworkers, and TJ can feel his heart go wild on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThey suit you, then\u201d he says, and there is a second when the world stops, and TJ wants to take back his words but he can\u2019t. Then, Cyrus smiles, and TJ lets go the breath he didn\u2019t notice he was holding and the Earth starts spinning again.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Cyrus blushes profusely but holds his gaze, eyes sparkling with something TJ can\u2019t describe. Recognition, maybe; something more, he hopes. TJ could get lost in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOk, I have a question\u201d The girl says, snapping TJ out of his trance. \u201cHow would you say in the language of flowers `Please, ask each other on a date so we don\u2019t have to watch you flirt with each other anymore\u00b4?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi!\u201d Cyrus exclaims, his cheeks blushing even redder. He hides his face in his hands, and TJ can\u2019t help but laugh, a warm feeling deep in his stomach.</p><p>Cyrus looks at him in between his fingers, cheeks still red. TJ doesn\u2019t know what to say, so he just smiles at him, sure that he is also blushing but not caring at all. Cyrus smiles back at him.</p><p>And TJ can only think about how true it is that he has sunshine on his smile.</p><p>(On their first date, Cyrus brings him daffodils. New beginnings, he tells him. TJ gives him thornless roses, but doesn\u2019t dare tell him the meaning. He is pretty sure Cyrus knows either way)</p>",

TJ turns around.</p><p>It\u2019s the cute boy.</p><p>\u201cHi, good morning\u201d he says, stepping into the shop \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>In TJ\u2019s defense, he thought Buffy had forgotten something and was the one entering the shop, so he had a pretty snarky remark on the tip of his tongue. He didn\u2019t expect cute boy.</p><p>TJ fumbles with the pot he was holding, nearly letting it fall from his hands. Finally, he places it in the table, trying his best to act natural.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d TJ says, cleaning his hands on his apron nervously. His voice sounds really high-pitched and he cringes internally \u201cHow, eh, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t even know if I want a bouquet or a potted flower, to be honest\u201d Cute guy says, smiling warmly at him \u201cAny recommendation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could fix you a bouquet with the camellias we\u2019ve received this morning\u201d TJ says, and gestures to at all the potted plants they have currently on the shop \u201cAnd we have all of these and also primroses on the back\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you\u201d</p><p>His voice is barely a whisper, but TJ turns around at the speed of light. Did he just say what he has heard? He feels his face warm up, and he is sure that he looks as red as the roses they have outside the shop.</p><p>\u201cThe meaning\u201d Cute guy says, eyes widening. His face has started to redden too and he is avoiding his eyes. \u201cThe meaning of primroses is `I can\u2019t live without you\u00b4. You know, the language of flowers and, well- eh, yeah\u201d</p><p>TJ heart rate starts slowing down again \u201cOh, yes, of course\u201d</p><p>God, he is so stupid. He seriously needs to stop acting like a middle-schooler with a crush. He is supposed to be an adult.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take one of the primroses\u201d Cute guy says quickly, still avoiding looking at him.</p><p>TJ just nods, heading to the backroom where they have all the primroses potted to look for one to give to Cute guy. He really needs to stop calling him Cute guy, but it\u2019s not like he knows his name. He could ask, sure, but TJ doesn\u2019t trust himself enough for that, he would mess it up somehow.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this one?\u201d TJ shows him one of the flowers they have in the back. They are actually quite beautiful and well maintained, Buffy has done a good job with them.</p><p>Cute guy nods, and the next transactions are all done in silence. While he pays, TJ is trying his best to come up with something to say, something that won\u2019t sound awkward, but his brain is not collaborating.</p><p>When TJ gives him his change, their hands brush and TJ could swear that cute guy blushed a little bit, but he is quick to grab his plant and head to the door.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Cute guy says, while opening the door \u201cHave a nice day\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too\u201d it\u2019s the only thing that TJ manages to say before the door closes.</p><p>He throws himself on the chair behind the cash register and hides his face on his hands. God, why is he incapable to have a normal conversation with a cute guy. He could have asked his name, he could have flirted a little, but no, the only thing he did was blush like a kid with a crush.</p><p>The bell over the door chimes again, and TJ looks in between his fingers. Buffy stands in front of him, at the other side of the cash register.</p><p>\u201cI guess it didn\u2019t go well?\u201d</p><p>TJ just groans, letting his head fall on the counter with a loud thud.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ is regretting a lot changing all of his shifts to the morning. First of all, because he blowed any chance he had with Cute guy, and second of all, because he has been running errands and delivering orders to the customers all morning and he is exhausted.</p><p>His feet are aching and he can barely see where he is going because he is carrying a giant flowerpot full of yellow tulips.</p><p>He stops in front of a tattoo parlor, thankfully not far from the flower shop, and sets the pot down on the sidewalk. The windows of the place are tinted, making it hard for him to see inside, and there is a big neon sign above the door that reads \u201cGHC\u201d, whatever that means. \u00a0According to google maps here is where he is supposed to deliver the flowers.\u00a0</p><p>He checks google again, confused. It doesn\u2019t look like the typical place where they usually deliver flowers, so he is starting to suspect that he might have the wrong address, but there is only one way to know.</p><p>He picks up the giant flowerpot again and rings the doorbell with his elbow. When the door opens he basically stumbles inside the tattoo parlor.</p><p>\u201cHi\u201d A confused voice says, and in between the tulips TJ can see a girl with short hair looking at him \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in the wrong place\u201d TJ tries his best to hold the flowerpot with only one hand to be able to see the girl he is talking to but fails miserably \u201cThere\u2019s a Cyrus Goodman here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he works here\u201d She says, stepping forward. The girl takes the flowerpot from his hands and sets it down on the front counter.</p><p>\u201cHe asked for the flowers to be delivered here\u201d TJ runs a hand through his hair, trying to make it look at least decent. He pulls the pad of papers from his back pocket and leafs through it trying to find the correct one.</p><p>Then, a guy comes out from one of the rooms in the back where TJ supposes they tattoo people. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any tattoo, at least that TJ can see, but he is wearing a lot of piercings all around his face.</p><p>\u201cHey, are these Cyrus\u2019 flowers?\u201d he asks, and the girl nods in his direction. The guy with the piercings turns around and knocks the door of one of the rooms \u201cCy, your flowers are here\u201d</p><p>TJ rips the correct piece of paper and gives it to the girl \u201cIf you could sign here, please\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course\u201d The girl takes the paper and slips behind the front counter, scribbling her name down before passing it back to him.</p><p>TJ is ready to go when another guy coming out from one of the rooms in the back grabs his attention. TJ\u2019s heart skips a beat.</p><p>It\u2019s the cute guy from the shop. He is there, with his shy smile and his doe eyes, and only wearing a t-shirt instead of his usual cardigans. Which is a surprise, because it means TJ can see both his arms are full of tattoos.</p><p>TJ is pretty sure he looks like an idiot, standing there without saying anything, but his brain is short-circuiting and he can\u2019t stop looking at him, trying to reconcile the image he had of Cute-guy from the image of Also-cute-but-heavily-tattooed guy he has in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Cute guy says, stopping dead on his tracks. He looks at TJ, and a little smile grows on his lips \u201cHi\u201d</p><p>The piercing guy looks at both of them \u201cYou know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works on the flower shop\u201d Cute guy says. TJ should stop calling him cute guy in his mind, apparently he is called Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOh, he works in the flower shop?\u201d The girl says, with a particular inflection on her voice, like she is trying to imply something that TJ doesn\u2019t catch. Cyrus looks at her and they seem to maintain a silent conversation just with their eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou really go a lot to that flower shop\u201d The guy with the piercings says distractedly while looking through some papers.</p><p>\u201cThey have nice flowers, Jonah\u201d Cyrus says quickly, gesticulating with his gloved hands. Then he looks at TJ, apologetically \u201cI keep telling them, just because it\u2019s a tattoo parlor it doesn\u2019t need to be all black and gloomy, we are not goths, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nods, still completely speechless.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why I keep buying flowers and yours are really good and-\u201d Cyrus continues, and TJ is not sure if he is talking to him or that Jonah guy \u201cSorry, I\u2019m rambling\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay\u201d TJ says. He points lightly at the flowerpot in the front counter \u201cSo, are these the tulips you ordered?\u201d</p><p>TJ feels a little bit awkward standing there, with his jeans and his hoodie that look too plain in comparison to their clothes and with dirt under his nails that look totally out of place in the extremely clean parlor.</p><p>\u201cYes, yellow tulips\u201d Cyrus removes his gloves and steps towards the front counter to examine the flowers \u201cThank you so much for bringing this here\u201d</p><p>TJ can\u2019t take his eyes out of Cyrus\u2019 arms. His tattoos are beautiful. It\u2019s an intricate design of a flowers stretching across his arms, bursting with color. They are so detailed that he is sure that he could spend hours looking at them,</p><p>No wonder he knows about the language of flowers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d He finds himself asking, without really thinking \u201cThe yellow tulips\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looks back at him and smiles, warm and wide, making TJ\u2019s mouth go dry and the butterflies in his stomach start fluttering again.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t he know? He is the florist\u201d Jonah whispers, but the girl shushes him quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere is sunshine in your smile\u201d Cyrus says simply, ignoring his coworkers, and TJ can feel his heart go wild on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThey suit you, then\u201d he says, and there is a second when the world stops, and TJ wants to take back his words but he can\u2019t. Then, Cyrus smiles, and TJ lets go the breath he didn\u2019t notice he was holding and the Earth starts spinning again.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Cyrus blushes profusely but holds his gaze, eyes sparkling with something TJ can\u2019t describe. Recognition, maybe; something more, he hopes. TJ could get lost in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOk, I have a question\u201d The girl says, snapping TJ out of his trance. \u201cHow would you say in the language of flowers `Please, ask each other on a date so we don\u2019t have to watch you flirt with each other anymore\u00b4?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi!\u201d Cyrus exclaims, his cheeks blushing even redder. He hides his face in his hands, and TJ can\u2019t help but laugh, a warm feeling deep in his stomach.</p><p>Cyrus looks at him in between his fingers, cheeks still red. TJ doesn\u2019t know what to say, so he just smiles at him, sure that he is also blushing but not caring at all. Cyrus smiles back at him.</p><p>And TJ can only think about how true it is that he has sunshine on his smile.</p><p>(On their first date, Cyrus brings him daffodils. New beginnings, he tells him. TJ gives him thornless roses, but doesn\u2019t dare tell him the meaning. He is pretty sure Cyrus knows either way)</p></p>",

If you see any mistakes feel free to tell me!))</p><p>TJ\u2019s favorite shifts in the flower shop are the afternoon ones. The owner is usually out and about, which means that he can do whatever he wants when there are no clients in the shop, the golden light of the setting sun enters through the big windows, and the shop smells like jasmine flowers and soil from the newly potted plants.</p><p>It\u2019s practically heaven on earth, while the morning shifts are a lot busier, his boss usually makes him run errands and deliver orders, and it also means that he has to deal with Buffy working the same shift.</p><p>So there has to be a reason as to why he has changed all his shifts to the morning, right?</p>[[MORE]]<p>-</p><p>\u201cTJ, stop looking through the window and help me with this, for God\u2019s sake\u201d</p><p>TJ snaps out of his trance and grabs one of the bags full of potting soil that Buffy is carrying with difficulty from the backroom.</p><p>\u201cAre you losing strength, Driscoll?\u201d he smirks, leaving the bag on the table and starting to organize the different flowers they have to plant.</p><p>Buffys scoffs and doesn\u2019t even try to dignify that question with a response. She starts filling up the pots with potting soil skillfully, not even looking at him.</p><p>Buffy and TJ, they have a weird relationship. They had a bad start, Buffy tolerating no bullshit and TJ being a little shit sometimes, but they have managed to make peace and somehow bond over shared interests. They are not the best of friends, and their relationship consists of making fun of each other most of the time, but they make it work.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it would be nice if you stopped acting like a wife waiting for his husband to return from war and worked sometime\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting like anything\u201d TJ says, not as eloquently as he would have liked. Buffy stops what she was doing to look at him with an eyebrow raised. TJ just rolls his eyes and starts filling flowerpots, a lot less gracefully than Buffy.</p><p>\u201cSure\u201d she says, shrugging. Then, TJ can see a devilish smile appear on her face \u201cThat is why you keep looking at the door with longing\u201d</p><p>TJ shakes his head, pointedly not looking at Buffy \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you blushing like a peony every time that guy comes by\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, blushing like a peony?\u201d TJ says, removing one lily from the flowerpot with a little too much force \u201cNice choice of words, very fitting\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are deflecting\u201d Buffy points at him \u201cAnd try not to kill the plants, you brute\u201d</p><p>TJ huffs. Of course he is deflecting. The last thing he needs is Buffy making fun of him for his obvious crush on the cute boy that comes by some mornings to buy flowers.</p><p>He is the reason he has changed all of his shifts, he had to make sure that he had an opportunity to see him again.</p><p>Not that it matters. Every time the guy looks at him he leaves TJ like a stuttering, blushing mess, and he doesn\u2019t dare to talk to him more than the necessary in case he makes an idiot of himself.</p><p>Don\u2019t judge him, it\u2019s not his fault that the guy is cute, and polite and really well-dressed. He has these really big brown eyes, and a shy smile that could light up a room, and he always wears cardigans and asks him how he is doing before asking for the flowers he wants.</p><p>Of course TJ is crushing hard on him. Come on, who wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cYou still here, TJ?\u201d Buffy waves a hand in front of his face</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d TJ lets go of the plant that he has been holding for a while and cleans his hand on his apron.</p><p>Buffy looks at him, exasperated, but her face changes suddenly to an expression that TJ is incapable to read.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she says, taking off her apron \u201cI think I\u2019m taking my break now\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, and gesticulates to all the plants and flowers that they still have to plant out \u201cAnd you are leaving me with all of this?\u201d</p><p>Buffy shrugs, a little smile dangling on her lips \u201cYou\u2019ll live, Kippen\u201d</p><p>And TJ, eyes wide with incredulity, sees her hang her apron, open the door and just leave like that. He can\u2019t believe that she would leave him with all the work to go flirt with the bakery guy. Because that\u2019s where she is going. Buffy knows it, TJ knows it, even Marty, the guy from the bakery, knows it.</p><p>He clicks his tongue loudly, thinking about how he will get revenge for this, when the bell over the door rings again. TJ turns around.</p><p>It\u2019s the cute boy.</p><p>\u201cHi, good morning\u201d he says, stepping into the shop \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>In TJ\u2019s defense, he thought Buffy had forgotten something and was the one entering the shop, so he had a pretty snarky remark on the tip of his tongue.

He looks at TJ, and a little smile grows on his lips \u201cHi\u201d</p><p>The piercing guy looks at both of them \u201cYou know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works on the flower shop\u201d Cute guy says. TJ should stop calling him cute guy in his mind, apparently he is called Cyrus.</p><p>\u201cOh, he works in the flower shop?\u201d The girl says, with a particular inflection on her voice, like she is trying to imply something that TJ doesn\u2019t catch. Cyrus looks at her and they seem to maintain a silent conversation just with their eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou really go a lot to that flower shop\u201d The guy with the piercings says distractedly while looking through some papers.</p><p>\u201cThey have nice flowers, Jonah\u201d Cyrus says quickly, gesticulating with his gloved hands. Then he looks at TJ, apologetically \u201cI keep telling them, just because it\u2019s a tattoo parlor it doesn\u2019t need to be all black and gloomy, we are not goths, you know?\u201d</p><p>TJ nods, still completely speechless.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why I keep buying flowers and yours are really good and-\u201d Cyrus continues, and TJ is not sure if he is talking to him or that Jonah guy \u201cSorry, I\u2019m rambling\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s okay\u201d TJ says. He points lightly at the flowerpot in the front counter \u201cSo, are these the tulips you ordered?\u201d</p><p>TJ feels a little bit awkward standing there, with his jeans and his hoodie that look too plain in comparison to their clothes and with dirt under his nails that look totally out of place in the extremely clean parlor.</p><p>\u201cYes, yellow tulips\u201d Cyrus removes his gloves and steps towards the front counter to examine the flowers \u201cThank you so much for bringing this here\u201d</p><p>TJ can\u2019t take his eyes out of Cyrus\u2019 arms. His tattoos are beautiful. It\u2019s an intricate design of a flowers stretching across his arms, bursting with color. They are so detailed that he is sure that he could spend hours looking at them,</p><p>No wonder he knows about the language of flowers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d He finds himself asking, without really thinking \u201cThe yellow tulips\u201d</p><p>Cyrus looks back at him and smiles, warm and wide, making TJ\u2019s mouth go dry and the butterflies in his stomach start fluttering again.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t he know? He is the florist\u201d Jonah whispers, but the girl shushes him quickly.</p><p>\u201cThere is sunshine in your smile\u201d Cyrus says simply, ignoring his coworkers, and TJ can feel his heart go wild on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThey suit you, then\u201d he says, and there is a second when the world stops, and TJ wants to take back his words but he can\u2019t. Then, Cyrus smiles, and TJ lets go the breath he didn\u2019t notice he was holding and the Earth starts spinning again.</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Cyrus blushes profusely but holds his gaze, eyes sparkling with something TJ can\u2019t describe. Recognition, maybe; something more, he hopes. TJ could get lost in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOk, I have a question\u201d The girl says, snapping TJ out of his trance. \u201cHow would you say in the language of flowers `Please, ask each other on a date so we don\u2019t have to watch you flirt with each other anymore\u00b4?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndi!\u201d Cyrus exclaims, his cheeks blushing even redder. He hides his face in his hands, and TJ can\u2019t help but laugh, a warm feeling deep in his stomach.</p><p>Cyrus looks at him in between his fingers, cheeks still red. TJ doesn\u2019t know what to say, so he just smiles at him, sure that he is also blushing but not caring at all. Cyrus smiles back at him.</p><p>And TJ can only think about how true it is that he has sunshine on his smile.</p><p>(On their first date, Cyrus brings him daffodils. New beginnings, he tells him. TJ gives him thornless roses, but doesn\u2019t dare tell him the meaning. He is pretty sure Cyrus knows either way)</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>Tell me with flowers - Flower shop/Tattoo Parlor AU</h2><p>((English is not my first language so writing this has been a lot more difficult than I expected, tbh. If you see any mistakes feel free to tell me!))</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s favorite shifts in the flower shop are the afternoon ones. The owner is usually out and about, which means that he can do whatever he wants when there are no clients in the shop, the golden light of the setting sun enters through the big windows, and the shop smells like jasmine flowers and soil from the newly potted plants.</p><p>It&rsquo;s practically heaven on earth, while the morning shifts are a lot busier, his boss usually makes him run errands and deliver orders, and it also means that he has to deal with Buffy working the same shift.</p><p>So there has to be a reason as to why he has changed all his shifts to the morning, right?</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;TJ, stop looking through the window and help me with this, for God&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;</p><p>TJ snaps out of his trance and grabs one of the bags full of potting soil that Buffy is carrying with difficulty from the backroom.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you losing strength, Driscoll?&rdquo; he smirks, leaving the bag on the table and starting to organize the different flowers they have to plant.</p><p>Buffys scoffs and doesn&rsquo;t even try to dignify that question with a response. She starts filling up the pots with potting soil skillfully, not even looking at him.</p><p>Buffy and TJ, they have a weird relationship. They had a bad start, Buffy tolerating no bullshit and TJ being a little shit sometimes, but they have managed to make peace and somehow bond over shared interests. They are not the best of friends, and their relationship consists of making fun of each other most of the time, but they make it work.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, it would be nice if you stopped acting like a wife waiting for his husband to return from war and worked sometime&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not acting like anything&rdquo; TJ says, not as eloquently as he would have liked. Buffy stops what she was doing to look at him with an eyebrow raised. TJ just rolls his eyes and starts filling flowerpots, a lot less gracefully than Buffy.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure&rdquo; she says, shrugging. Then, TJ can see a devilish smile appear on her face &ldquo;That is why you keep looking at the door with longing&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shakes his head, pointedly not looking at Buffy &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about you blushing like a peony every time that guy comes by&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, blushing like a peony?&rdquo; TJ says, removing one lily from the flowerpot with a little too much force &ldquo;Nice choice of words, very fitting&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are deflecting&rdquo; Buffy points at him &ldquo;And try not to kill the plants, you brute&rdquo;</p><p>TJ huffs. Of course he is deflecting. The last thing he needs is Buffy making fun of him for his obvious crush on the cute boy that comes by some mornings to buy flowers.</p><p>He is the reason he has changed all of his shifts, he had to make sure that he had an opportunity to see him again.</p><p>Not that it matters. Every time the guy looks at him he leaves TJ like a stuttering, blushing mess, and he doesn&rsquo;t dare to talk to him more than the necessary in case he makes an idiot of himself.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t judge him, it&rsquo;s not his fault that the guy is cute, and polite and really well-dressed. He has these really big brown eyes, and a shy smile that could light up a room, and he always wears cardigans and asks him how he is doing before asking for the flowers he wants.</p><p>Of course TJ is crushing hard on him. Come on, who wouldn&rsquo;t?</p><p>&ldquo;You still here, TJ?&rdquo; Buffy waves a hand in front of his face</p><p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; TJ lets go of the plant that he has been holding for a while and cleans his hand on his apron.</p><p>Buffy looks at him, exasperated, but her face changes suddenly to an expression that TJ is incapable to read.</p><p>&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; she says, taking off her apron &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m taking my break now&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he says, and gesticulates to all the plants and flowers that they still have to plant out &ldquo;And you are leaving me with all of this?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy shrugs, a little smile dangling on her lips &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live, Kippen&rdquo;</p><p>And TJ, eyes wide with incredulity, sees her hang her apron, open the door and just leave like that. He can&rsquo;t believe that she would leave him with all the work to go flirt with the bakery guy. Because that&rsquo;s where she is going. Buffy knows it, TJ knows it, even Marty, the guy from the bakery, knows it.</p><p>He clicks his tongue loudly, thinking about how he will get revenge for this, when the bell over the door rings again. TJ turns around.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the cute boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, good morning&rdquo; he says, stepping into the shop &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p><p>In TJ&rsquo;s defense, he thought Buffy had forgotten something and was the one entering the shop, so he had a pretty snarky remark on the tip of his tongue. He didn&rsquo;t expect cute boy.</p><p>TJ fumbles with the pot he was holding, nearly letting it fall from his hands. Finally, he places it in the table, trying his best to act natural.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; TJ says, cleaning his hands on his apron nervously. His voice sounds really high-pitched and he cringes internally &ldquo;How, eh, can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm, I&rsquo;m not sure. I don&rsquo;t even know if I want a bouquet or a potted flower, to be honest&rdquo; Cute guy says, smiling warmly at him &ldquo;Any recommendation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I could fix you a bouquet with the camellias we&rsquo;ve received this morning&rdquo; TJ says, and gestures to at all the potted plants they have currently on the shop &ldquo;And we have all of these and also primroses on the back&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live without you&rdquo;</p><p>His voice is barely a whisper, but TJ turns around at the speed of light. Did he just say what he has heard? He feels his face warm up, and he is sure that he looks as red as the roses they have outside the shop.</p><p>&ldquo;The meaning&rdquo; Cute guy says, eyes widening. His face has started to redden too and he is avoiding his eyes. &ldquo;The meaning of primroses is `I can&rsquo;t live without you&acute;. You know, the language of flowers and, well- eh, yeah&rdquo;</p><p>TJ heart rate starts slowing down again &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course&rdquo;</p><p>God, he is so stupid. He seriously needs to stop acting like a middle-schooler with a crush. He is supposed to be an adult.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take one of the primroses&rdquo; Cute guy says quickly, still avoiding looking at him.</p><p>TJ just nods, heading to the backroom where they have all the primroses potted to look for one to give to Cute guy. He really needs to stop calling him Cute guy, but it&rsquo;s not like he knows his name. He could ask, sure, but TJ doesn&rsquo;t trust himself enough for that, he would mess it up somehow.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like this one?&rdquo; TJ shows him one of the flowers they have in the back. They are actually quite beautiful and well maintained, Buffy has done a good job with them.</p><p>Cute guy nods, and the next transactions are all done in silence. While he pays, TJ is trying his best to come up with something to say, something that won&rsquo;t sound awkward, but his brain is not collaborating.</p><p>When TJ gives him his change, their hands brush and TJ could swear that cute guy blushed a little bit, but he is quick to grab his plant and head to the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Cute guy says, while opening the door &ldquo;Have a nice day&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You too&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the only thing that TJ manages to say before the door closes.</p><p>He throws himself on the chair behind the cash register and hides his face on his hands. God, why is he incapable to have a normal conversation with a cute guy. He could have asked his name, he could have flirted a little, but no, the only thing he did was blush like a kid with a crush.</p><p>The bell over the door chimes again, and TJ looks in between his fingers. Buffy stands in front of him, at the other side of the cash register.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess it didn&rsquo;t go well?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ just groans, letting his head fall on the counter with a loud thud.</p><p>-</p><p>TJ is regretting a lot changing all of his shifts to the morning. First of all, because he blowed any chance he had with Cute guy, and second of all, because he has been running errands and delivering orders to the customers all morning and he is exhausted.</p><p>His feet are aching and he can barely see where he is going because he is carrying a giant flowerpot full of yellow tulips.</p><p>He stops in front of a tattoo parlor, thankfully not far from the flower shop, and sets the pot down on the sidewalk. The windows of the place are tinted, making it hard for him to see inside, and there is a big neon sign above the door that reads &ldquo;GHC&rdquo;, whatever that means. &nbsp;According to google maps here is where he is supposed to deliver the flowers.&nbsp;</p><p>He checks google again, confused. It doesn&rsquo;t look like the typical place where they usually deliver flowers, so he is starting to suspect that he might have the wrong address, but there is only one way to know.</p><p>He picks up the giant flowerpot again and rings the doorbell with his elbow. When the door opens he basically stumbles inside the tattoo parlor.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi&rdquo; A confused voice says, and in between the tulips TJ can see a girl with short hair looking at him &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m in the wrong place&rdquo; TJ tries his best to hold the flowerpot with only one hand to be able to see the girl he is talking to but fails miserably &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Cyrus Goodman here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, he works here&rdquo; She says, stepping forward. The girl takes the flowerpot from his hands and sets it down on the front counter.</p><p>&ldquo;He asked for the flowers to be delivered here&rdquo; TJ runs a hand through his hair, trying to make it look at least decent. He pulls the pad of papers from his back pocket and leafs through it trying to find the correct one.</p><p>Then, a guy comes out from one of the rooms in the back where TJ supposes they tattoo people. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any tattoo, at least that TJ can see, but he is wearing a lot of piercings all around his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, are these Cyrus&rsquo; flowers?&rdquo; he asks, and the girl nods in his direction. The guy with the piercings turns around and knocks the door of one of the rooms &ldquo;Cy, your flowers are here&rdquo;</p><p>TJ rips the correct piece of paper and gives it to the girl &ldquo;If you could sign here, please&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course&rdquo; The girl takes the paper and slips behind the front counter, scribbling her name down before passing it back to him.</p><p>TJ is ready to go when another guy coming out from one of the rooms in the back grabs his attention. TJ&rsquo;s heart skips a beat.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the cute guy from the shop. He is there, with his shy smile and his doe eyes, and only wearing a t-shirt instead of his usual cardigans. Which is a surprise, because it means TJ can see both his arms are full of tattoos.</p><p>TJ is pretty sure he looks like an idiot, standing there without saying anything, but his brain is short-circuiting and he can&rsquo;t stop looking at him, trying to reconcile the image he had of Cute-guy from the image of Also-cute-but-heavily-tattooed guy he has in front of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; Cute guy says, stopping dead on his tracks. He looks at TJ, and a little smile grows on his lips &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;</p><p>The piercing guy looks at both of them &ldquo;You know each other?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He works on the flower shop&rdquo; Cute guy says. TJ should stop calling him cute guy in his mind, apparently he is called Cyrus.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, he works in the flower shop?&rdquo; The girl says, with a particular inflection on her voice, like she is trying to imply something that TJ doesn&rsquo;t catch. Cyrus looks at her and they seem to maintain a silent conversation just with their eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You really go a lot to that flower shop&rdquo; The guy with the piercings says distractedly while looking through some papers.</p><p>&ldquo;They have nice flowers, Jonah&rdquo; Cyrus says quickly, gesticulating with his gloved hands. Then he looks at TJ, apologetically &ldquo;I keep telling them, just because it&rsquo;s a tattoo parlor it doesn&rsquo;t need to be all black and gloomy, we are not goths, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ nods, still completely speechless.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I keep buying flowers and yours are really good and-&rdquo; Cyrus continues, and TJ is not sure if he is talking to him or that Jonah guy &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m rambling&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no.

I would also recommend flooding the official Disney Channel youtube channel with comments about the video, and comments about renewing Andi Mack because we know that they look through their comments on there.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, if you use twitter or instagram - you should really turn on post notifications for both @DisneyChannel and @DisneyChannelPR and reply to all of their posts with the hashtag, and start liking/retweeting/replying to other fans who use the hashtag. Right now it seems like a lot of the fanbase&rsquo;s social media power is in tumblr, but unfortunately tumblr activity is the least relevant when fighting for a renewal so if this is something you guys want to keep fighting for - I really recommend more of a focus on other platforms.
