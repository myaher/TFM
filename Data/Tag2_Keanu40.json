One particular song called \"Above All\" (Like a Rose ...) by Michael W. Smith helped him through his most difficult moments.\n\n\"It arrived when I was confused and angry. I didn't think I could go on. The song described how Jesus was rejected and alone. That thought took me to a place \u2014 it opened an interior door that held me while on the cross,\" an emotional Caviezel explained. \"The experience of feeling rejected and alone as all those around me laughed while drinking their hot coffees, oblivious to what was occurring. Jesus must have felt like this \u2014 forsaken, rejected, alone, and despised. It helped me pray in a very deep way \u2014 to pray without words, to pray from the heart. The discomfort, the loneliness, the split shoulder, the raw flesh all forced me into the arms of God because I had nowhere else to go for a performance I knew I was unable to create.\"\nJim Caviezel, Shamelessly Catholic",

The action-heavy franchise that revived Keanu Reeves&rsquo; career in \nmany ways is back in theaters with another installment, and while the \naction is top notch as usual, the third entry in the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/john-wick/\" target=\"_blank\">John Wick</a> franchise also spends plenty of time exploring the larger assassin world.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to John Wick, who has \npreviously been a very mysterious hitman as far as audiences can tell, \nbut a legend in this universe to many. The first film only explained \nthat John used to be a prolific assassin working for The Continental \nwho jumps back into this lifestyle after his dog is killed. John Wick\n teased more of a history for The Boogeyman through his back tattoo \nwhich reads &ldquo;Fortis Fortuna Adiuvat&rdquo; in Latin. This phrase, translated \nto say &ldquo;Fortune Favors the Bold,&rdquo; is a motto of the Marine Corps. and \nmany assumed that John was a military man before his days as an \nassassin. However, he leaves the assassin lifestyle behind by completing\n an impossible task for Viggo Tarasov, allowing him to become happily \nmarried for a few years.</p>When <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/john-wick-2/\" target=\"_blank\">John Wick: Chapter 2</a>\n hit theaters in 2017, some more clues of John&rsquo;s past came in regards to\n that task. We learned that John actually received some level of help in\n this situation from Santino D'Antonio, which gave him a marker that he \ncould use at his will to make John return the favor. The blood oath was \nreluctantly fulfilled by John and eventually results in him murdering \nSantino on Continental grounds, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/john-wick-recap-who-kill-excommunicado/\" target=\"_blank\">making John excommunicado</a> and the biggest target in New York. That is where John Wick: Chapter 3 picks up, and after some heart-racing action, it dives deep into John&rsquo;s past and reveals some surprising things along the way.<h2>John Wick&rsquo;s Real Name Is [&hellip;]</h2><p>After John is able to fend off a few dozen assassins, he sets his \nplan to leave New York and escape with the hope of meeting the one man \nwho is above The High Table so that he can be pardoned and continue to \nlive. This plan takes John to a new location filled with new characters \nfor the franchise, but all of this is familiar for John.<b> It is during \nthese scenes that a major revelation comes to audiences, as John \nproclaims that his real name is Jardani Jovonovich.</b></p><p>He says this in an effort to prove that he is worthy of being \nhelped by the mysterious new group. J<b>ardani means John in Romani, and \nsince John reverts to calling himself this during the exchange, it \nappears that Jardani Jovonovich is his actual birth name. This would \nthen indicate that he was Jardani as a child, but then changed his name \nto John Wick to embrace his assassin lifestyle. But, it also means that \nhis new name isn&rsquo;t just random, but rather derived from his original \none, where his last name of Wick is pulled from the end of Jovonovich.</b></p><br/><h2>The Director</h2><p>John only goes back to his old name though because he is speaking to The Director, director of a new character for the series <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/john-wick-3-cast-other-roles/\" target=\"_blank\">played by Anjelica Huston</a> and\n head of the Ruska Roma where John grew up. She is another high ranking \nfigure within this assassin underworld someone who works with the High \nTable, but is still below their laws and rules. Because of this, The \nDirector shouldn&rsquo;t even be speaking to John based on his excommunicado \nstatus, but there is an implied long history between them that makes her\n go against her better judgement and help John.</p><p>This decision comes back to hurt her, as an Adjudicator from the High\n Table pays her a visit with a band of assassins. The Director is \nordered to stick her hands out together and the Adjudicator orders a \nsword to go through them both, leaving her with a permanent reminder of \nthe cost of helping John and betraying the High Table.</p><h2>The School</h2><p>The Director appears to be a vital part of the High Table&rsquo;s operation\n too, as she is in charge of a school that develops and trains young \nassassins. The front for the Ruska Roma&rsquo;s operation is a ballet studio \nand performance center, but the students are being taught much more than\n just how to dance. The boy students are shown training in combat, while\n the girls are shown perfecting their dance routines. However, the first\n scene at the school features one female dancer with bruises on her body\n (likely from the combat training), while a later scene includes male \ndancers too, so all of the attendees are receiving the same level of \ntraining.</p>This school is more important to the John Wick universe \nbeyond its role in the overall system though, as it also appears to be \nwhere John Wick received his training. All of the students have the same\n cross tattoo on their backs as John is shown to have on multiple \noccasions, and this further explains why he knows of the location and \nhas a connection to The Director. This wasn&rsquo;t just a place for John to \ngo to get away, but may very well be how he got his started on this path\n to begin with.<h2>The Key/Ticket Cross</h2><p>With this history to The Director and her school of assassins, that \nfurther explains the cross necklace that John uses as the explanation \nfor why he deserves their help, It is the latest important artifact to \ncome from the John Wick universe. As an orphan and last member \nof his tribe, John carries an Orthodox crucifix and rosary, representing\n a debt owed to him by The Director.</p>The cross is John&rsquo;s ticket to escape New York and secure safe passage\n from The Director&rsquo;s forces all the way to Casablanca. This ticket only \nhas a one time use though, as the acceptance of the cross by The \nDirector then sees the ticket punched (in a sense) by the \ncross being put in fire and then branded upside down in the center of \nthe cross tattoo on John&rsquo;s back, signifying that it has been used. The \ncommonality of the cross tattoos with assassins at the school may \nfurther indicate that this is all part of this particular school&rsquo;s \ntraining and graduation.<p>\u2014</p><p>These new details on John Wick&rsquo;s backstory \nultimately leave fans with much more knowledge about Baba Yaga and his \njourney to become the man he is today.

The action-heavy franchise that revived Keanu Reeves\u2019 career in \nmany ways is back in theaters with another installment, and while the \naction is top notch as usual, the third entry in the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/john-wick/\" target=\"_blank\">John Wick</a> franchise also spends plenty of time exploring the larger assassin world.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to John Wick, who has \npreviously been a very mysterious hitman as far as audiences can tell, \nbut a legend in this universe to many. The first film only explained \nthat John used to be a prolific assassin working for The Continental \nwho jumps back into this lifestyle after his dog is killed. John Wick\n teased more of a history for The Boogeyman through his back tattoo \nwhich reads \u201cFortis Fortuna Adiuvat\u201d in Latin. This phrase, translated \nto say \u201cFortune Favors the Bold,\u201d is a motto of the Marine Corps. and \nmany assumed that John was a military man before his days as an \nassassin. However, he leaves the assassin lifestyle behind by completing\n an impossible task for Viggo Tarasov, allowing him to become happily \nmarried for a few years.</p>When <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/john-wick-2/\" target=\"_blank\">John Wick: Chapter 2</a>\n hit theaters in 2017, some more clues of John\u2019s past came in regards to\n that task. We learned that John actually received some level of help in\n this situation from Santino D'Antonio, which gave him a marker that he \ncould use at his will to make John return the favor. The blood oath was \nreluctantly fulfilled by John and eventually results in him murdering \nSantino on Continental grounds, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/john-wick-recap-who-kill-excommunicado/\" target=\"_blank\">making John excommunicado</a> and the biggest target in New York. That is where John Wick: Chapter 3 picks up, and after some heart-racing action, it dives deep into John\u2019s past and reveals some surprising things along the way.<h2>John Wick\u2019s Real Name Is [\u2026]</h2><p>After John is able to fend off a few dozen assassins, he sets his \nplan to leave New York and escape with the hope of meeting the one man \nwho is above The High Table so that he can be pardoned and continue to \nlive. This plan takes John to a new location filled with new characters \nfor the franchise, but all of this is familiar for John.<b> It is during \nthese scenes that a major revelation comes to audiences, as John \nproclaims that his real name is Jardani Jovonovich.</b></p><p>He says this in an effort to prove that he is worthy of being \nhelped by the mysterious new group.

This would \nthen indicate that he was Jardani as a child, but then changed his name \nto John Wick to embrace his assassin lifestyle. But, it also means that \nhis new name isn\u2019t just random, but rather derived from his original \none, where his last name of Wick is pulled from the end of Jovonovich.</b></p><br><h2>The Director</h2><p>John only goes back to his old name though because he is speaking to The Director, director of a new character for the series <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/john-wick-3-cast-other-roles/\" target=\"_blank\">played by Anjelica Huston</a> and\n head of the Ruska Roma where John grew up. She is another high ranking \nfigure within this assassin underworld someone who works with the High \nTable, but is still below their laws and rules.

The front for the Ruska Roma\u2019s operation is a ballet studio \nand performance center, but the students are being taught much more than\n just how to dance. The boy students are shown training in combat, while\n the girls are shown perfecting their dance routines. However, the first\n scene at the school features one female dancer with bruises on her body\n (likely from the combat training), while a later scene includes male \ndancers too, so all of the attendees are receiving the same level of \ntraining.</p>This school is more important to the John Wick universe \nbeyond its role in the overall system though, as it also appears to be \nwhere John Wick received his training. All of the students have the same\n cross tattoo on their backs as John is shown to have on multiple \noccasions, and this further explains why he knows of the location and \nhas a connection to The Director.

This ticket only \nhas a one time use though, as the acceptance of the cross by The \nDirector then sees the ticket punched (in a sense) by the \ncross being put in fire and then branded upside down in the center of \nthe cross tattoo on John\u2019s back, signifying that it has been used.
