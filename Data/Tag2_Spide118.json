He hangs his head in shame, trying to become invisible. Peter didn\u2019t want to be there. Not only that he didn&rsquo;t like parties, but he was having a difficult enough time already. Harry was keen on cheering him up, and he was always trying to find him a girlfriend. The legendary Harry Osborn called himself the king of wingmen, well, lets just say that he wasn\u2019t. Melissa had seen Peter around school, and assemblies, being the top ranking in their class. Despite how often she had seen him at school, they didn\u2019t hold \u00a0a single conversation that lasted more than five minutes. Surprisingly, she had talked with Harry at multiple of the parties she was dragged to. Melissa noticed that Harry was starting to move her way.</p><p>\u201cSup, MVP.\u201d reminding Melissa of his nickname for her. \u201cYou partying hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, if I&rsquo;m drinking I won&rsquo;t be able to resist you,&ldquo; Melissa teased. A quarter of the time they are together, Harry and Melissa flirt, without any meaning behind it.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you buddies with Peter over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me and Parker go way back. Don&rsquo;t you both go to Midtown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a big enough school, I don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d she responded. Liz Allen had found her way back to the two. </p><p>\u201cHey Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201dYo, Parker. Come over here,\u201d Osborn shouted across the room. So, in response, Parker did just that. \u201cDo you know my friends here? They\u2019re from Midtown too,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Liz and Melissa was both on the scholastic bowl team last year. School photographer, so I take pictures of a lot of people,\u201d he explained, he secretly had a crush on Liz Allen, so he did know a lot about the girl and her friends. </p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re joining this year, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Liz asked. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, welcome to the team then.\u201d Melissa said before Liz could get a word out. It was uncommon how they thinked so much alike. </p><p>\u201cLiz! LIZ!\u201d a blond girl shouted.</p><p>\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s my cue to go,\u201d she said before parting from the group. \u201cWait up, I\u2019ll join you,\u201d Harry shouted. He then winked at Peter.

He hangs his head in shame, trying to become invisible. Peter didn\u2019t want to be there. Not only that he didn\u2019t like parties, but he was having a difficult enough time already. Harry was keen on cheering him up, and he was always trying to find him a girlfriend. The legendary Harry Osborn called himself the king of wingmen, well, lets just say that he wasn\u2019t. Melissa had seen Peter around school, and assemblies, being the top ranking in their class. Despite how often she had seen him at school, they didn\u2019t hold \u00a0a single conversation that lasted more than five minutes. Surprisingly, she had talked with Harry at multiple of the parties she was dragged to. Melissa noticed that Harry was starting to move her way.</p><p>\u201cSup, MVP.\u201d reminding Melissa of his nickname for her. \u201cYou partying hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, if I\u2019m drinking I won\u2019t be able to resist you,\u201c Melissa teased. A quarter of the time they are together, Harry and Melissa flirt, without any meaning behind it.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you buddies with Peter over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me and Parker go way back. Don\u2019t you both go to Midtown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s a big enough school, I don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d she responded.

So, in response, Parker did just that. \u201cDo you know my friends here? They\u2019re from Midtown too,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Liz and Melissa was both on the scholastic bowl team last year. School photographer, so I take pictures of a lot of people,\u201d he explained, he secretly had a crush on Liz Allen, so he did know a lot about the girl and her friends. </p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re joining this year, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Liz asked. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, welcome to the team then.\u201d Melissa said before Liz could get a word out.

                "content": "<p><h1>Ardor &#12299; Peter Parker Fanfic </h1><h2>Chapter Three: There&rsquo;s No Party Without Richy-rich Jr</h2><p><b>Peter Parker entered</b> through the doorway. He hangs his head in shame, trying to become invisible. Peter didn&rsquo;t want to be there. Not only that he didn&rsquo;t like parties, but he was having a difficult enough time already. Harry was keen on cheering him up, and he was always trying to find him a girlfriend. The legendary Harry Osborn called himself the king of wingmen, well, lets just say that he wasn&rsquo;t. Melissa had seen Peter around school, and assemblies, being the top ranking in their class. Despite how often she had seen him at school, they didn&rsquo;t hold &nbsp;a single conversation that lasted more than five minutes. Surprisingly, she had talked with Harry at multiple of the parties she was dragged to. Melissa noticed that Harry was starting to move her way.</p><p>&ldquo;Sup, MVP.&rdquo; reminding Melissa of his nickname for her. &ldquo;You partying hard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, if I&rsquo;m drinking I won&rsquo;t be able to resist you,&ldquo; Melissa teased. A quarter of the time they are together, Harry and Melissa flirt, without any meaning behind it.</p><p>&ldquo;So, are you buddies with Peter over there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, me and Parker go way back. Don&rsquo;t you both go to Midtown?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but it&rsquo;s a big enough school, I don&rsquo;t know him very well,&rdquo; she responded. Liz Allen had found her way back to the two. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey Liz.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>&rdquo;Yo, Parker. Come over here,&rdquo; Osborn shouted across the room. So, in response, Parker did just that. &ldquo;Do you know my friends here? They&rsquo;re from Midtown too,&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, Liz and Melissa was both on the scholastic bowl team last year. School photographer, so I take pictures of a lot of people,&rdquo; he explained, he secretly had a crush on Liz Allen, so he did know a lot about the girl and her friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re joining this year, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Liz asked. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, welcome to the team then.&rdquo; Melissa said before Liz could get a word out. It was uncommon how they thinked so much alike. </p><p>&ldquo;Liz! LIZ!&rdquo; a blond girl shouted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well I guess that&rsquo;s my cue to go,&rdquo; she said before parting from the group. &ldquo;Wait up, I&rsquo;ll join you,&rdquo; Harry shouted. He then winked at Peter. Melissa had noticed and rolled her eyes at Harry.</p><p>&rdquo;Your dad works as an factory worker, right?&rdquo; Peter asked, trying to make some small talk after that awkwardness.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, a parts manufacturer for Oscorp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool. What does your mom do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; My mom died two years ago, then we moved here.&rdquo; Melissa answered, looking down at her shoes.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;m sorry about your uncle. I know what you&rsquo;re going through. I&rsquo;m here, if you ever need someone to talk to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see the big MIT speech?&rdquo; he added, trying to change the conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I must have missed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, weren&rsquo;t you in the hospital? I thought I heard something like that from classmates.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, the rumors are true.&rdquo; she said, not knowing if she was even telling the truth. </p><p>&ldquo;How are you feeling? Being in a hospital for an entire month must have sucked.&rdquo;</p><p>She shrugged, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all fuzzy, but that&rsquo;s nothing compared to losing a guardian, I should be the one asking how you are doing.&rdquo;</p><p>Stumbling, Liz had found her way back to Melissa. &ldquo;Mel, I think I&rsquo;m gonna be sick. I don&rsquo;t feel good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to take care of her,&rdquo; Melissa explained tp Peter as she led her friend to the bathroom. Melissa sat her down in front of the toilet just in time. Liz had started to vomit, &nbsp;which wasn&rsquo;t a pretty sight. </p><p>&ldquo;I hate this. I hate that everyone thinks I&rsquo;m perfect. I&rsquo;m obviously not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Liz, hey! Listen to me, no one is perfect. Ok, and you&rsquo;re pretty damn close.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Easy for you to say. You Are perfect.&rdquo; This hit Melissa in the gut. She was far from perfect, and she lived a pretty crappy life. She just summed up to the beer she was drinking.</p><p>&ldquo;Liz, you don&rsquo;t mean that, you&rsquo;re drunk. You&rsquo;re in a bad place right now, ok? Your boyfriend just broke up with you.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;mmmh&hellip;&rdquo; she moaned, and then like that, Liz was out.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, you gotta stay awake, so I can get you to the car.&rdquo; Half awake, Liz had leaned against Melissa. She kept Liz upright and they stumbled their way out of the bathroom. She bumped into Peter on the way out. </p><p>&ldquo;I gotta take her home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, do you need me to call a cab?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, she brought her car. I have my license, so I can drive her home.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How are you supposed to get home?&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just stay with her tonight, make sure she doesn&rsquo;t do anything she&rsquo;ll regret. </p><p>&ldquo;Well, I can at least help you get her out to the car.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; Peter grabbed her free arm and hoisted it over his shoulder like Melissa had done.</p><p>&ldquo;Mel, you smell pretty,&rdquo; Liz blurted out. Melissa chuckled in response. They had finally made their way out to the car. Melissa buckled her in the passenger seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the help. Do you want a ride home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I don&rsquo;t live far from here.&rdquo; He lied, he knew he would take them out of the way. </p><p>&ldquo;You sure?
