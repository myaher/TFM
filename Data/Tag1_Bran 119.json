                "content": "<p>&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that Bloodraven, Beric and Euron and their link to one eye symbolism works as&nbsp; a foreshadowing for Bran, Arya and Dany. First of all, Beric and Euron aren&rsquo;t that important to Arya and Dany storylines, not as much as Bloodraven is to Bran &rsquo;s. If those two were mentoring the girls like Bloodraven is doing with Bran I could see them passing the one eye symbolism to their pupils and that serving as a link to those three. But that&rsquo;s not the case.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>However I do believe that Bran, Arya and Dany will work together at some point. They are part of the key five Martin&rsquo;s protagonists.

But her stomach was tender, and she was grateful for the bland food, that\nshe could keep down. The tension in the great hall had been almost thick enough\nfor her to hold it, but the Northern Lords had been polite enough. Certainly, for\nsomeone who had faced down the hatred of the Mereen masters, it was nothing.</p><!-- more --><p>Her rooms\nwere a bit too serene for her taste as well. Apparently, Lady Stark had reserved\nthe best room for Dany as was her due, and Lady Stark herself had moved to\nanother part of the castle. Dany had not slept well, though. Her dreams were\nstill haunted by the green flames that had engulfed the Red Keep, the voices\nthat screamed, and her narrow escape on Drogon. It didn\u2019t matter. The Red Keep\nhad collapsed as if the sun had gone down in red and green fire. <i>If I look back, I am lost.</i> The capital\nwas hers, Lady Stark already tried to get in her good graces. When Jon\nreturned, Dany would get her dragon back.</p><p>Dany was on\nher way to the godswood, led by both the Stark ladies. Greyworm was her escort\nand she was glad about him. Of late, she didn\u2019t like to be alone, and she did\nnot trust the Starks, especially not Arya. <i>Stick\nher with the pointy end.</i> Jon had insisted it was a joke, but the smaller\nStark girl looked fierce.</p><p>The\ngodswood was indeed a small wood, the branches were laden with snow. When they\npassed under the trees, one of the trees shuddered as if he wanted to get rid\nof his burden and snow fell. It hit Dany at the neck, and she shuddered\ninvoluntarily when the cold crept down her back. She tried to picture years and\nyears living in this silent snow. She did not like it. In such a silent wood\nshe could almost hear voices screaming as from afar. Once she had her other\ndragon back, she would see to it, that Winterfell would burn, and that her\ninsolent nephew would pay for the crime of stealing Rhaegal. She could be\npatient though. <i>First things first.</i></p><p>They came\nto a small clearing. In the mid of it was a small pool and a huge tree at the\npool, the bark only slightly less white than the snow all around them, the\nleaves red as a fresh wound. Tendrils of steam rose from the pool like fingers\nthat reached out to the tree. The pool must have a connection to the hot water\npools beneath Winterfell. </p><p>Brandon\nStark sat beside the tree, on a chair with wheels, his legs packed into layers\nof covers. His face showed no motion when they approached, but his eyes snapped\nin her direction.</p><p>\u201cBran, this\nis Daenerys Targaryen,\u201d Arya said.</p><p>Dany\nfrowned. <i>She should have introduced me as\nqueen.</i> Missandei would have done that better.</p><p>The\ncrippled man, <i>no really, still a boy, by\nthe look of him,</i> nodded and gestured at his legs as if apologizing for not\ngetting up to greet her.</p><p>\u201cI am the\nthree-eyed raven.\u201d</p><p>Dany gave\nhim one of her dazzling smiles. </p><p>\u201cI heard\nabout you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome\nhere.\u201d</p><p>When Dany\ncame closer, his eyes locked onto hers.</p><p>\u201cYou need\nto see, but let me explain.\u201d</p><p>He took her\nleft hand in his, his hand felt strange, not cold, but not warm either, as if the\nwarm blood stole away when her fingers touched his.</p><p>\u201cThe future\nis an ever-shifting stream. What looked like a mighty river months ago, might\nnow be nothing more than a small rivulet. What today looks not likely to\nhappen, might be a strong stream tomorrow almost impossible to escape. It is\nnot easy to pick apart the strands. I\u2019ll try to guide you, but I cannot control\nwhat path you will be shown.\u201d</p><p>Dany\nnodded. \u201cI am familiar with prophecies.\u201d <i>This\ntime I won\u2019t be duped. I will use this to my own advantage. In the House of the\nUndying I saw the throne, though. And I almost have it.</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\nchannel the visions to you, you will see events that are important for you.\u201d</p><p>She\nthought, it would be a similar experience to the house of the Undying, but she\nwas not prepared for the influx of visions that flooded her, when Bran Stark\nput his own hand to the strange tree. She looked at the visions as if from\nafar, not as if she was in them.</p><p><i>Jon on Rhaegal\u2019s back fighting an army of the\nstrange Undead, raining fire on them.</i></p><p><i>Davos, Jon Snow\u2019s hand, circled by the Undead,\nhis breath puffing.</i></p><p><i>A young man she vaguely remembered from the banquet\nyesterday, where he had sat on the benches, back to back with Arya.</i></p><p><i>Dany herself riding Drogon, Winterfell beneath\nher, a sea of red and green flames, Undead going up in flames everywhere. She\nwas circling the white tree with the red leaves. Dany could almost feel the\nflames building in Drogon\u2019s chest.</i></p><p><i>Jaime Lannister and that tall woman Brienne\nrunning, running, as if their lives depended on it. </i></p><p><i>Sansa, her blood colouring the snow around her\nas it gushed out in a constant rhythm. Arya bent over her, wailing.</i></p><p><i>Rhaegal on the ground, snarling, breathing\nfire, bleeding from many wounds, Jon Snow with raised sword at his side, eyes\nguarded and wary, his handsome face half covered in blood. He swayed,\nexhausted. Two shadowy shapes came closer. His sword clattered, when he let it\nfall, beaten.</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy intent on drawing a bow, his eyes\nintent, red and green flames reflected in his pupils. The arrow looked pale as\na bone.</i></p><p><i>Bran Stark sitting like he sat now, his hand\ntouching the torched remains of a tree, his eyes looking empty.</i></p><p><i>Herself again, a silver circlet on her brow, a\nsea of men and women before her, kneeling. At her side was a darkhaired boy,\nwith the violet eyes of her family. Dany\u2019s hand was on his shoulders, and he\nsmiled up at her proudly. The beauty of the picture made her shudder. She had a\ncrown on her head and the people were calling at her.</i></p><p>The images\nwhirled in her head. She had the feeling of a current that was about to overwhelm\nher. <i>That is my son! </i>She snatched her\nhand away. Suddenly her tender stomach made sense. <i>When the sun sets in the east, when mountains fall\u2026 What had been the\nthird again?</i> She thought of King\u2019s Landing burning, of the Wall falling.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d\nBran said. \u201cThat can\u2019t have been all! You have not seen enough!\u201d</p><p>Dany shook\nher head. \u201cI saw victory. That is enough. I know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Bran\nsearched her face, his eyes boring into hers. \u201cPlease, Daenerys, for the sake\nof all of us. Look at other futures.\u201d</p><p>She shook\nher head again. \u201cThis is the future I want.\u201d</p><p>Bran closed\nhis eyes and inhaled deeply. \u201cSo be it.\u201d</p><p>He opened\nhis eyes again. </p><p>\u201cJon is on\nhis way, Sansa, he rides on the wings of a second storm. We\u2019d best prepare for another\nsiege. The stakes are even higher this time.\u201d</p><p>Dany schooled\nher face. <i>Soon.</i> <i>I know what I must do. </i>She could taste triumph on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI want to\nplan with my Hand.\u201d, she said. </p><p>She gave\nBran a gracious nod. \u201cThank you for sharing your wisdom.\u201d <i>The Stark boy surely knows, that I\u2019m going to win. Other futures? Pah.\nI will refound my dynasty. I\u2019ll have a son. </i></p><p>His eyes\nwere sad. <i>Maybe he\u2019ll be useful. </i></p><p>She\ngestured Greyworm to follow her and turned around. It was time to leave this\ncold place and the gaze of the three-eyed raven and the scowls of his sisters. Briefly\nDany wondered if she would need to ensure the death of her nephew\u2019s cousins.\nAccording to the visions, Sansa would not be a problem, but Arya might. <i>Stick her with the pointy end</i>.</p><p>\u201cWe must be\nready for a great sacrifice,\u201d Daenerys heard Bran. She did not turn, it was\nnone of her business that Bran wanted to prepare his sister for her imminent\ndeath.</p>",

Arya bent over her, wailing.</i></p><p><i>Rhaegal on the ground, snarling, breathing\nfire, bleeding from many wounds, Jon Snow with raised sword at his side, eyes\nguarded and wary, his handsome face half covered in blood. He swayed,\nexhausted. Two shadowy shapes came closer. His sword clattered, when he let it\nfall, beaten.</i></p><p><i>Theon Greyjoy intent on drawing a bow, his eyes\nintent, red and green flames reflected in his pupils. The arrow looked pale as\na bone.</i></p><p><i>Bran Stark sitting like he sat now, his hand\ntouching the torched remains of a tree, his eyes looking empty.</i></p><p><i>Herself again, a silver circlet on her brow, a\nsea of men and women before her, kneeling. At her side was a darkhaired boy,\nwith the violet eyes of her family. Dany&rsquo;s hand was on his shoulders, and he\nsmiled up at her proudly. The beauty of the picture made her shudder. She had a\ncrown on her head and the people were calling at her.</i></p><p>The images\nwhirled in her head. She had the feeling of a current that was about to overwhelm\nher. <i>That is my son! </i>She snatched her\nhand away. Suddenly her tender stomach made sense. <i>When the sun sets in the east, when mountains fall&hellip; What had been the\nthird again?</i> She thought of King&rsquo;s Landing burning, of the Wall falling.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;\nBran said. &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t have been all! You have not seen enough!&rdquo;</p><p>Dany shook\nher head. &ldquo;I saw victory. That is enough. I know what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran\nsearched her face, his eyes boring into hers. &ldquo;Please, Daenerys, for the sake\nof all of us. Look at other futures.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook\nher head again. &ldquo;This is the future I want.&rdquo;</p><p>Bran closed\nhis eyes and inhaled deeply. &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened\nhis eyes again. </p><p>&ldquo;Jon is on\nhis way, Sansa, he rides on the wings of a second storm. We&rsquo;d best prepare for another\nsiege. The stakes are even higher this time.&rdquo;</p><p>Dany schooled\nher face. <i>Soon.</i> <i>I know what I must do. </i>She could taste triumph on her tongue.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to\nplan with my Hand.&rdquo;, she said. </p><p>She gave\nBran a gracious nod. &ldquo;Thank you for sharing your wisdom.&rdquo; <i>The Stark boy surely knows, that I&rsquo;m going to win. Other futures? Pah.\nI will refound my dynasty. I&rsquo;ll have a son. </i></p><p>His eyes\nwere sad. <i>Maybe he&rsquo;ll be useful. </i></p><p>She\ngestured Greyworm to follow her and turned around. It was time to leave this\ncold place and the gaze of the three-eyed raven and the scowls of his sisters. Briefly\nDany wondered if she would need to ensure the death of her nephew&rsquo;s cousins.\nAccording to the visions, Sansa would not be a problem, but Arya might. <i>Stick her with the pointy end</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;We must be\nready for a great sacrifice,&rdquo; Daenerys heard Bran. She did not turn, it was\nnone of her business that Bran wanted to prepare his sister for her imminent\ndeath.</p>",

Written from Dany&rsquo;s PoV which was very hard to write. I think it&rsquo;s extremely difficult.<br /></p>\n<p>A short warning. Dany thinks she is pregnant, but she isn&rsquo;t. Just for the people who don&rsquo;t like that particular plot.</p>\n<p>Lady Stark\nhad been as good as her word. There had been meat for Drogon and food and\nclothing for her Unsullied, even something like a feast, if you could call it\nthat. The frugality was certainly overdone, and Dany was sure, that Lady Stark\nheld back, just to drive home her insistence that they had to ration for the\nwinter. But her stomach was tender, and she was grateful for the bland food, that\nshe could keep down. The tension in the great hall had been almost thick enough\nfor her to hold it, but the Northern Lords had been polite enough. Certainly, for\nsomeone who had faced down the hatred of the Mereen masters, it was nothing.</p>\n</p>",
