You&rsquo;re on your way to this Christmas Masquerade Ball that your brother, Tony Stark, is holding. You opened your purse and got a mirror, you looked at yourself and smiled, satisfied on how you looked for tonight. &ldquo;Ms. y/n, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Your driver said. &ldquo;Thank you, Happy.&rdquo; You smiled and went out of the car. You got inside the venue, looked around and saw how beautifully the place is decorated. &ldquo;Impressive. This is such a Tony Stark move.&rdquo; You said and giggled. Tony had rented out a bigger venue for the ball as you quote him, <i>&ldquo;The tower can&rsquo;t accommodate all your fancy gowns.&rdquo;</i> </p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is a Tony Stark move.&rdquo; A random guy wearing a red mask contrasting his blonde hair said. You laughed, and so does the guy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you around, Ms. Black Mask.&rdquo; The guy said leaving you alone. <i>&ldquo;And you thought I \u00a0wouldn&rsquo;t notice you, Steve Rogers.&rdquo; </i> you said to yourself. You walked around, and saw familiar faces. &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; a white masked lady is now beside you. &ldquo;Stop it, Nat. I know it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; You said to your bestfriend. &ldquo;God, I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize me. I hate you.&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t miss the red hair so-&rdquo; You trailed.</p><p>An hour had passed and Steve is still ringing in your head. &ldquo;Why does he look so fucking good all the time?&rdquo; you blurt out, sipping in your drink. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Wanda asked returning on your table. You were startled, &ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; But knowing your bestfriends, they know very well you&rsquo;re lying. they looked at you suspiciously. &ldquo;Fine, fine! I&rsquo;ll spill!&rdquo; Natasha and Wanda giggled. &ldquo;Who is it? We might know him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Awhile ago, when I arrived here, a <i>random</i> guy with a red mask talked to me. I was talking to myself but I guess my voice was kind of loud that he heard it and made a small conversation with me.&rdquo; You said. &ldquo;Hmm.. is it that guy?&rdquo; Natasha pointed at your back and saw Steve, talking to Bucky, Sam and Clint. &ldquo;Unfortunately, it is.&rdquo; you asked. Wanda smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still into him huh.&rdquo; Natasha eyed you, &ldquo;Well, couldn&rsquo;t really get him out of my mind that easily.&rdquo; You replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Go after him.&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;What? No! Why would I? I told myself I&rsquo;ll leave him be.&rdquo; You replied. &ldquo;y/n, you&rsquo;re obviously <i>so</i> into him still, and he&rsquo;s probably too.&rdquo; Wanda said. &ldquo;PROBABLY, we&rsquo;re not sure about it. And besides, he&rsquo;s got company.&rdquo; You said, eyeing Steve and a person you recognize easily, <i>Sharon.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hello there, ladies.&rdquo; Tony said walking towards you three. You smiled at Pepper and gave her a hug. &ldquo;How are you? I haven&rsquo;t seen you in awhile.&rdquo; Pepper said to you, which made you sigh. &ldquo;Well, you can ask my brother to why you haven&rsquo;t seen me in days.&rdquo; You replied looking at your brother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s busy. <i>Very</i> busy.&rdquo; Tony winked at you. Tony and you have agreed on you training to be in the Avengers, but is keeping it a secret for the meantime, as you both don&rsquo;t know how things will work out once you announce it to them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s that part of the event that everyone&rsquo;s on their feet and on the dance floor. You were so bored that you went to the bar inside the hotel that the event&rsquo;s taking place and ordered a drink. &ldquo;God, can this event finish already? I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo; You said, making the bartender laugh. You were having your second drink when a guy went up to you, &ldquo;May I have this dance, mi lady?&rdquo; you looked at him and saw that it was Steve, you smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re seriously asking me to dance with you?&rdquo; he nodded and smiled, taking his hand out for you to reach. You held his hand and proceeded to the dance floor. The song was a slow tempo. You looked into his eyes, which he did with as well. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked. You smiled but didn&rsquo;t answer his question. &ldquo;You look good wearing that mask, mi lady.&rdquo; You smiled, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He goes near your ear and whispered, &ldquo;But you will look better if you&rsquo;re in bed with me.&rdquo; You smirked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see then.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t know why you answered that but maybe it&rsquo;s the alcohol talking. The two of you were about to leave the venue when the electricity were cut off. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Wait here, mi lady.&rdquo; Steve told you. </p><p>Once Steve leaves, you put in your in-ear and talked to Tony, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;I need you to leave, y/n. I won&rsquo;t risk you getting hurt here if something bad is gonna happen.&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re training me to be on your team, Stark. I won&rsquo;t leave this goddamn place.&rdquo; you answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny you call me Stark, but you are one, too.&rdquo; Tony teased. &ldquo;Oh shut up, oldie.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;FRIDAY, give me something. heat signatures, anything.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Heat signatures on the podium, Miss y/n. Looks like someone is being held hostage.&rdquo; FRIDAY replied. you thanked the AI afterwards. </p><p>The electricity went back on and you saw Rumlow, holding Pepper hostage. You looked at Tony, who has a gun aimed at him by Rollins. Looking at the other Avengers, they were being cautious on their moves, to not hurt any civilians or their own. &ldquo;Leave Pepper alone, Rumlow. If you want me, take me instead.&rdquo; Tony said. <i>Dumbass </i>you said to yourself. &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t want you, Mr. Stark. You know who I want.&rdquo; Rumlow said, sending chills down your spine. It&rsquo;s you who they want. It&rsquo;s sole reason why Tony is making you train to be one of the Avengers, for you to be safe. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;Is she now? Your sister will miss one of your grandest parties?&rdquo; Rumlow scoffed. Eyes locked on Rumlow, you walked slowly behind the scared people, trying not to make any noise with your high heeled shoes. </p><p>You aimed your pistol on Rumlow&rsquo;s head, calculating, making sure not to hit Pepper and put her in danger, before hitting fire, Rumlow&rsquo;s blood slowly dripped down on Pepper&rsquo;s shoulders, making her shriek and ran to Happy. &ldquo;Push that trigger and I swear to God, i&rsquo;ll blow your brains out just like your friend here.&rdquo; You said to Rollins, aiming your gun to him, making him look at you. Rollins smirked, you saw him push the trigger slowly, but even before he could fully pull the trigger, you shot his hand making him drop his gun and wince in pain. You ran towards a nearby table and jumped on Rollins, making your thighs wrapped around his neck, struggling, Rollins tried to get a knife on his pocket but couldn&rsquo;t. You used gravity and the force of your body to bring him to the ground.</p><p>The guy tried to break free from your hold, and succeeded, tossing you to the side. Rollins grabbed the gun you left on the ground, and aimed it towards Tony again. You tapped your makeshift watch that your brother gave you, and it turned into a Ironman-glove, you zapped Rollins with a stun-burst before he can pull the trigger on Tony. You rushed towards him, firing again. Rollins ducks the blast then trades blows with you, firing the gun. You had the glove on the barrel, blocking the bullet. You pull the gun barrel loose then Rollins smacks you backwards, making your mask fall to the ground. Tony fired his reactor towards Rollins, making the latter bounce off and pass out.</p><p>You looked at Tony, &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve done that awhile ago.&rdquo; you said to him. The other Avengers looked at you, stunned. &ldquo;What the hell just happened?&rdquo; Sam asked the others. &ldquo;How- how did she managed to do all those?&rdquo; Wanda asked the others as well. You walked towards them and smiled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all talk later. But first, let&rsquo;s get back to the tower, I&rsquo;m fucking tired from all these shits.&rdquo; You said. Steve looked at you and you winked at him. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;I saw that.&rdquo; Tony said, you smiled. &ldquo;You see everything, Tony. But not this Rumlow attack though.&rdquo; You said and laugh. Tony looked at you with disbelief. &ldquo;You little rascal, get back here!&rdquo; Tony said following you behind.</p><p>Once all of you got back to the tower, you explained everything. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s basically it.&rdquo; you said and sat on the conference table. &ldquo;So, Rumlow got obsessed with you and he was planning to kidnap you?&rdquo; Steve repeated what you said, to which you nodded in reply. &ldquo;Well, not gonna lie here, y/n is obviously very pretty and smart. Kind too.&rdquo; Sam said, making you smile. &ldquo;Thank you, Sam.&rdquo; you replied. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re only telling this to us, just now, when he already attacked us and caught all of us off guard?&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;Yeah. I could&rsquo;ve told you guys beforehand but didn&rsquo;t. I did great though, can&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo; You replied. Steve sighed, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all call it a night. Tony, we need to talk.&rdquo; he said, making you look at Tony, your eyebrows furrowed.

You\u2019re on your way to this Christmas Masquerade Ball that your brother, Tony Stark, is holding. You opened your purse and got a mirror, you looked at yourself and smiled, satisfied on how you looked for tonight. \u201cMs. y/n, we\u2019re here.\u201d Your driver said. \u201cThank you, Happy.\u201d You smiled and went out of the car. You got inside the venue, looked around and saw how beautifully the place is decorated. \u201cImpressive. This is such a Tony Stark move.\u201d You said and giggled. Tony had rented out a bigger venue for the ball as you quote him, <i>\u201cThe tower can\u2019t accommodate all your fancy gowns.\u201d</i> </p><p>\u201cIndeed, it is a Tony Stark move.\u201d A random guy wearing a red mask contrasting his blonde hair said. You laughed, and so does the guy. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Ms. Black Mask.\u201d The guy said leaving you alone. <i>\u201cAnd you thought I \u00a0wouldn\u2019t notice you, Steve Rogers.\u201d </i> you said to yourself. You walked around, and saw familiar faces. \u201cBoo!\u201d a white masked lady is now beside you. \u201cStop it, Nat. I know it\u2019s you.\u201d You said to your bestfriend. \u201cGod, I thought you wouldn\u2019t even recognize me. I hate you.\u201d Natasha said. \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t miss the red hair so-\u201d You trailed.</p><p>An hour had passed and Steve is still ringing in your head. \u201cWhy does he look so fucking good all the time?\u201d you blurt out, sipping in your drink. \u201cWho?\u201d Wanda asked returning on your table. You were startled, \u201cWhat? It\u2019s nothing.\u201d But knowing your bestfriends, they know very well you\u2019re lying. they looked at you suspiciously. \u201cFine, fine! I\u2019ll spill!\u201d Natasha and Wanda giggled. \u201cWho is it? We might know him.\u201d \u201cAwhile ago, when I arrived here, a <i>random</i> guy with a red mask talked to me. I was talking to myself but I guess my voice was kind of loud that he heard it and made a small conversation with me.\u201d You said. \u201cHmm.. is it that guy?\u201d Natasha pointed at your back and saw Steve, talking to Bucky, Sam and Clint. \u201cUnfortunately, it is.\u201d you asked. Wanda smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re still into him huh.\u201d Natasha eyed you, \u201cWell, couldn\u2019t really get him out of my mind that easily.\u201d You replied.</p><p>\u201cGo after him.\u201d Natasha said. \u201cWhat? No! Why would I? I told myself I\u2019ll leave him be.\u201d You replied. \u201cy/n, you\u2019re obviously <i>so</i> into him still, and he\u2019s probably too.\u201d Wanda said. \u201cPROBABLY, we\u2019re not sure about it. And besides, he\u2019s got company.\u201d You said, eyeing Steve and a person you recognize easily, <i>Sharon.</i></p><p>\u201cHello there, ladies.\u201d Tony said walking towards you three. You smiled at Pepper and gave her a hug. \u201cHow are you? I haven\u2019t seen you in awhile.\u201d Pepper said to you, which made you sigh. \u201cWell, you can ask my brother to why you haven\u2019t seen me in days.\u201d You replied looking at your brother. \u201cShe\u2019s busy. <i>Very</i> busy.\u201d Tony winked at you. Tony and you have agreed on you training to be in the Avengers, but is keeping it a secret for the meantime, as you both don\u2019t know how things will work out once you announce it to them.</p><p>It\u2019s that part of the event that everyone\u2019s on their feet and on the dance floor. You were so bored that you went to the bar inside the hotel that the event\u2019s taking place and ordered a drink. \u201cGod, can this event finish already? I\u2019m tired.\u201d You said, making the bartender laugh. You were having your second drink when a guy went up to you, \u201cMay I have this dance, mi lady?\u201d you looked at him and saw that it was Steve, you smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously asking me to dance with you?\u201d he nodded and smiled, taking his hand out for you to reach. You held his hand and proceeded to the dance floor. The song was a slow tempo. You looked into his eyes, which he did with as well. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked. You smiled but didn\u2019t answer his question. \u201cYou look good wearing that mask, mi lady.\u201d You smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201d He goes near your ear and whispered, \u201cBut you will look better if you\u2019re in bed with me.\u201d You smirked, \u201cWe\u2019ll see then.\u201d You don\u2019t know why you answered that but maybe it\u2019s the alcohol talking. The two of you were about to leave the venue when the electricity were cut off. \u201cShit.\u201d you said. \u201cWait here, mi lady.\u201d Steve told you. </p><p>Once Steve leaves, you put in your in-ear and talked to Tony, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening?\u201d you asked. \u201cI need you to leave, y/n. I won\u2019t risk you getting hurt here if something bad is gonna happen.\u201d Tony replied. \u201cYou\u2019re training me to be on your team, Stark. I won\u2019t leave this goddamn place.\u201d you answered. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you call me Stark, but you are one, too.\u201d Tony teased. \u201cOh shut up, oldie.\u201d you said. \u201cFRIDAY, give me something. heat signatures, anything.\u201d you said. \u201cHeat signatures on the podium, Miss y/n. Looks like someone is being held hostage.\u201d FRIDAY replied. you thanked the AI afterwards. </p><p>The electricity went back on and you saw Rumlow, holding Pepper hostage. You looked at Tony, who has a gun aimed at him by Rollins. Looking at the other Avengers, they were being cautious on their moves, to not hurt any civilians or their own. \u201cLeave Pepper alone, Rumlow. If you want me, take me instead.\u201d Tony said. <i>Dumbass </i>you said to yourself. \u201cOh I don\u2019t want you, Mr. Stark. You know who I want.\u201d Rumlow said, sending chills down your spine. It\u2019s you who they want. It\u2019s sole reason why Tony is making you train to be one of the Avengers, for you to be safe. \u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u201d Tony replied. \u201cIs she now? Your sister will miss one of your grandest parties?\u201d Rumlow scoffed. Eyes locked on Rumlow, you walked slowly behind the scared people, trying not to make any noise with your high heeled shoes. </p><p>You aimed your pistol on Rumlow\u2019s head, calculating, making sure not to hit Pepper and put her in danger, before hitting fire, Rumlow\u2019s blood slowly dripped down on Pepper\u2019s shoulders, making her shriek and ran to Happy. \u201cPush that trigger and I swear to God, i\u2019ll blow your brains out just like your friend here.\u201d You said to Rollins, aiming your gun to him, making him look at you. Rollins smirked, you saw him push the trigger slowly, but even before he could fully pull the trigger, you shot his hand making him drop his gun and wince in pain. You ran towards a nearby table and jumped on Rollins, making your thighs wrapped around his neck, struggling, Rollins tried to get a knife on his pocket but couldn\u2019t. You used gravity and the force of your body to bring him to the ground.</p><p>The guy tried to break free from your hold, and succeeded, tossing you to the side. Rollins grabbed the gun you left on the ground, and aimed it towards Tony again. You tapped your makeshift watch that your brother gave you, and it turned into a Ironman-glove, you zapped Rollins with a stun-burst before he can pull the trigger on Tony. You rushed towards him, firing again. Rollins ducks the blast then trades blows with you, firing the gun. You had the glove on the barrel, blocking the bullet. You pull the gun barrel loose then Rollins smacks you backwards, making your mask fall to the ground. Tony fired his reactor towards Rollins, making the latter bounce off and pass out.</p><p>You looked at Tony, \u201cYou could\u2019ve done that awhile ago.\u201d you said to him. The other Avengers looked at you, stunned. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Sam asked the others. \u201cHow- how did she managed to do all those?\u201d Wanda asked the others as well. You walked towards them and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s all talk later. But first, let\u2019s get back to the tower, I\u2019m fucking tired from all these shits.\u201d You said. Steve looked at you and you winked at him. <br></p><p>\u201cI saw that.\u201d Tony said, you smiled. \u201cYou see everything, Tony. But not this Rumlow attack though.\u201d You said and laugh. Tony looked at you with disbelief. \u201cYou little rascal, get back here!\u201d Tony said following you behind.</p><p>Once all of you got back to the tower, you explained everything. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it.\u201d you said and sat on the conference table. \u201cSo, Rumlow got obsessed with you and he was planning to kidnap you?\u201d Steve repeated what you said, to which you nodded in reply. \u201cWell, not gonna lie here, y/n is obviously very pretty and smart. Kind too.\u201d Sam said, making you smile. \u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd you\u2019re only telling this to us, just now, when he already attacked us and caught all of us off guard?\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYeah. I could\u2019ve told you guys beforehand but didn\u2019t. I did great though, can\u2019t deny that.\u201d You replied. Steve sighed, \u201cLet\u2019s all call it a night. Tony, we need to talk.\u201d he said, making you look at Tony, your eyebrows furrowed. Tony just shrugged back at you.</p><p>It was around 1 in the morning, when your stomach grumbled. \u201cWhy am I even hungry?\u201d you asked yourself. You went down to the kitchen to get something to munch on, when you someone behind you cleared his throat. \u201cYes Steve, what is it?\u201d you asked, not looking at him. He sighed, \u201cYou could\u2019ve died in there.\u201d Steve said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t, so-\u201d \u201cStop with that attitude of yours, y/n.\u201d you looked at him and said, \u201cMake me.\u201d Steve smirked at you, walking towards you, \u201cOh I will.\u201d he said before crashing his lips with yours.</p>",

You tapped your makeshift watch that your brother gave you, and it turned into a Ironman-glove, you zapped Rollins with a stun-burst before he can pull the trigger on Tony. You rushed towards him, firing again. Rollins ducks the blast then trades blows with you, firing the gun. You had the glove on the barrel, blocking the bullet. You pull the gun barrel loose then Rollins smacks you backwards, making your mask fall to the ground. Tony fired his reactor towards Rollins, making the latter bounce off and pass out.</p><p>You looked at Tony, \u201cYou could\u2019ve done that awhile ago.\u201d you said to him. The other Avengers looked at you, stunned. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Sam asked the others. \u201cHow- how did she managed to do all those?\u201d Wanda asked the others as well. You walked towards them and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s all talk later. But first, let\u2019s get back to the tower, I\u2019m fucking tired from all these shits.\u201d You said.

Kind too.\u201d Sam said, making you smile. \u201cThank you, Sam.\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd you\u2019re only telling this to us, just now, when he already attacked us and caught all of us off guard?\u201d Natasha said. \u201cYeah. I could\u2019ve told you guys beforehand but didn\u2019t. I did great though, can\u2019t deny that.\u201d You replied. Steve sighed, \u201cLet\u2019s all call it a night.

I&rsquo;m sorry.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://evanstush.tumblr.com/post/184986140744/masterlist\">MASTERLIST</a></b></p><p>You were in the car, listening to some Christmas songs. You&rsquo;re on your way to this Christmas Masquerade Ball that your brother, Tony Stark, is holding. You opened your purse and got a mirror, you looked at yourself and smiled, satisfied on how you looked for tonight. &ldquo;Ms. y/n, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; Your driver said. &ldquo;Thank you, Happy.&rdquo; You smiled and went out of the car. You got inside the venue, looked around and saw how beautifully the place is decorated. &ldquo;Impressive. This is such a Tony Stark move.&rdquo; You said and giggled. Tony had rented out a bigger venue for the ball as you quote him, <i>&ldquo;The tower can&rsquo;t accommodate all your fancy gowns.&rdquo;</i> </p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is a Tony Stark move.&rdquo; A random guy wearing a red mask contrasting his blonde hair said. You laughed, and so does the guy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you around, Ms. Black Mask.&rdquo; The guy said leaving you alone. <i>&ldquo;And you thought I &nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t notice you, Steve Rogers.&rdquo; </i> you said to yourself. You walked around, and saw familiar faces. &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; a white masked lady is now beside you. &ldquo;Stop it, Nat. I know it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo; You said to your bestfriend. &ldquo;God, I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize me. I hate you.&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t miss the red hair so-&rdquo; You trailed.</p><p>An hour had passed and Steve is still ringing in your head. &ldquo;Why does he look so fucking good all the time?&rdquo; you blurt out, sipping in your drink. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Wanda asked returning on your table. You were startled, &ldquo;What? It&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; But knowing your bestfriends, they know very well you&rsquo;re lying. they looked at you suspiciously. &ldquo;Fine, fine! I&rsquo;ll spill!&rdquo; Natasha and Wanda giggled. &ldquo;Who is it? We might know him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Awhile ago, when I arrived here, a <i>random</i> guy with a red mask talked to me. I was talking to myself but I guess my voice was kind of loud that he heard it and made a small conversation with me.&rdquo; You said. &ldquo;Hmm.. is it that guy?&rdquo; Natasha pointed at your back and saw Steve, talking to Bucky, Sam and Clint. &ldquo;Unfortunately, it is.&rdquo; you asked. Wanda smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still into him huh.&rdquo; Natasha eyed you, &ldquo;Well, couldn&rsquo;t really get him out of my mind that easily.&rdquo; You replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Go after him.&rdquo; Natasha said. &ldquo;What? No! Why would I? I told myself I&rsquo;ll leave him be.&rdquo; You replied. &ldquo;y/n, you&rsquo;re obviously <i>so</i> into him still, and he&rsquo;s probably too.&rdquo; Wanda said. &ldquo;PROBABLY, we&rsquo;re not sure about it. And besides, he&rsquo;s got company.&rdquo; You said, eyeing Steve and a person you recognize easily, <i>Sharon.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hello there, ladies.&rdquo; Tony said walking towards you three. You smiled at Pepper and gave her a hug. &ldquo;How are you? I haven&rsquo;t seen you in awhile.&rdquo; Pepper said to you, which made you sigh. &ldquo;Well, you can ask my brother to why you haven&rsquo;t seen me in days.&rdquo; You replied looking at your brother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s busy. <i>Very</i> busy.&rdquo; Tony winked at you. Tony and you have agreed on you training to be in the Avengers, but is keeping it a secret for the meantime, as you both don&rsquo;t know how things will work out once you announce it to them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s that part of the event that everyone&rsquo;s on their feet and on the dance floor. You were so bored that you went to the bar inside the hotel that the event&rsquo;s taking place and ordered a drink. &ldquo;God, can this event finish already? I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo; You said, making the bartender laugh. You were having your second drink when a guy went up to you, &ldquo;May I have this dance, mi lady?&rdquo; you looked at him and saw that it was Steve, you smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re seriously asking me to dance with you?&rdquo; he nodded and smiled, taking his hand out for you to reach. You held his hand and proceeded to the dance floor. The song was a slow tempo. You looked into his eyes, which he did with as well. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked. You smiled but didn&rsquo;t answer his question. &ldquo;You look good wearing that mask, mi lady.&rdquo; You smiled, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He goes near your ear and whispered, &ldquo;But you will look better if you&rsquo;re in bed with me.&rdquo; You smirked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see then.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t know why you answered that but maybe it&rsquo;s the alcohol talking. The two of you were about to leave the venue when the electricity were cut off. &ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Wait here, mi lady.&rdquo; Steve told you. </p><p>Once Steve leaves, you put in your in-ear and talked to Tony, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;I need you to leave, y/n. I won&rsquo;t risk you getting hurt here if something bad is gonna happen.&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re training me to be on your team, Stark. I won&rsquo;t leave this goddamn place.&rdquo; you answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny you call me Stark, but you are one, too.&rdquo; Tony teased. &ldquo;Oh shut up, oldie.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;FRIDAY, give me something. heat signatures, anything.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;Heat signatures on the podium, Miss y/n. Looks like someone is being held hostage.&rdquo; FRIDAY replied. you thanked the AI afterwards. </p><p>The electricity went back on and you saw Rumlow, holding Pepper hostage. You looked at Tony, who has a gun aimed at him by Rollins. Looking at the other Avengers, they were being cautious on their moves, to not hurt any civilians or their own. &ldquo;Leave Pepper alone, Rumlow. If you want me, take me instead.&rdquo; Tony said. <i>Dumbass </i>you said to yourself. &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t want you, Mr. Stark. You know who I want.&rdquo; Rumlow said, sending chills down your spine. It&rsquo;s you who they want. It&rsquo;s sole reason why Tony is making you train to be one of the Avengers, for you to be safe. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo; Tony replied. &ldquo;Is she now? Your sister will miss one of your grandest parties?&rdquo; Rumlow scoffed. Eyes locked on Rumlow, you walked slowly behind the scared people, trying not to make any noise with your high heeled shoes. </p><p>You aimed your pistol on Rumlow&rsquo;s head, calculating, making sure not to hit Pepper and put her in danger, before hitting fire, Rumlow&rsquo;s blood slowly dripped down on Pepper&rsquo;s shoulders, making her shriek and ran to Happy. &ldquo;Push that trigger and I swear to God, i&rsquo;ll blow your brains out just like your friend here.&rdquo; You said to Rollins, aiming your gun to him, making him look at you. Rollins smirked, you saw him push the trigger slowly, but even before he could fully pull the trigger, you shot his hand making him drop his gun and wince in pain. You ran towards a nearby table and jumped on Rollins, making your thighs wrapped around his neck, struggling, Rollins tried to get a knife on his pocket but couldn&rsquo;t. You used gravity and the force of your body to bring him to the ground.</p><p>The guy tried to break free from your hold, and succeeded, tossing you to the side. Rollins grabbed the gun you left on the ground, and aimed it towards Tony again. You tapped your makeshift watch that your brother gave you, and it turned into a Ironman-glove, you zapped Rollins with a stun-burst before he can pull the trigger on Tony. You rushed towards him, firing again. Rollins ducks the blast then trades blows with you, firing the gun. You had the glove on the barrel, blocking the bullet. You pull the gun barrel loose then Rollins smacks you backwards, making your mask fall to the ground. Tony fired his reactor towards Rollins, making the latter bounce off and pass out.</p><p>You looked at Tony, &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve done that awhile ago.&rdquo; you said to him. The other Avengers looked at you, stunned. &ldquo;What the hell just happened?&rdquo; Sam asked the others. &ldquo;How- how did she managed to do all those?&rdquo; Wanda asked the others as well.

Tony, we need to talk.&rdquo; he said, making you look at Tony, your eyebrows furrowed. Tony just shrugged back at you.</p><p>It was around 1 in the morning, when your stomach grumbled. &ldquo;Why am I even hungry?&rdquo; you asked yourself. You went down to the kitchen to get something to munch on, when you someone behind you cleared his throat. &ldquo;Yes Steve, what is it?&rdquo; you asked, not looking at him. He sighed, &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve died in there.&rdquo; Steve said. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t, so-&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop with that attitude of yours, y/n.&rdquo; you looked at him and said, &ldquo;Make me.&rdquo; Steve smirked at you, walking towards you, &ldquo;Oh I will.&rdquo; he said before crashing his lips with yours.</p>",
