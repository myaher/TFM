Steve could see him embracing his daughter&rsquo;s body into his arms tightly as tears were rolling down his face. Steve let out a deep sigh and he felt a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Steve,&rdquo; Bucky said as he patted him on the shoulder and they both just watched as y/n&rsquo;s father disappeared into the darkness of the woods. taking his daughter with him.&nbsp;</p><p>A week later, It was the funeral of y/n, Steve had fixed his tie and looked at himself in the mirror of his apartment.&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; Bucky said as he walked into his room,&nbsp;&ldquo;I barely knew her, yet I feel responsible for her.&rdquo; He said staring at bucky through the mirror.&nbsp;&ldquo;You had no idea that was going to happen, and besides she would want you to go.&rdquo; Steve clenched his jaw and nodded. When they both arrived Steve had stopped Bucky,&nbsp;&ldquo;I would rather stay right here, I don&rsquo;t want to bother them.&rdquo; Bucky nodded and stood next to Steve as they watched. Steve placed his hands in his pockets and looked down at the ground, even though he barely knew y/n he felt some kind of connection with her, she was funny to him, her smile, her lips everything about her intrigued him, but now that she was gone a part of him was gone too. As the funeral ended all of the people left little by little until it was only Steve and Bucky left. Bucky said nothing but stood there with Steve.&nbsp;&ldquo;You can go if you want, I think I&rsquo;m going to hang out here for a bit.&rdquo; He said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving you, pal.&rdquo; He said smiling at him. Steve had walked to where she had been buried and stood there for a moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I let this happen to you.&rdquo; he paused for a moment and the rain had started to pour, he didn&rsquo;t move a muscle, he just stayed.&nbsp;</p><p>*********************************************************</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8a78df1cbf356d7865f72d2bd653569/tumblr_inline_prmcc6eE8C1w57764_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Present time.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Several months later after the war, Steve had sacrificed himself in order to save others. He had crash landed a plane into the frozen ice and remained there for 75 years, everyone had thought he had been dead. He woke up in a brightly lit room, nothing but the sound of the radio. He got out of bed and looked around him. A woman had come inside of the room,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello Mr. Rogers, you&rsquo;re up..good.&rdquo; she said. Steve had been confused, he furrowed his eyebrows and listened carefully to the sound of the radio, he knew things weren&rsquo;t right, he began to ask the woman questions. And mentioned that the game playing on the radio was of a baseball game that he once went to with his dad. The woman swallowed hard and paged some of the agents that had been watching him. Steve saw and quickly crashed through the walls of the small room taking him somewhere else. As he ran through the streets of New York, everything had been different to him, where the hell was he? He stopped to look around him and saw a bunch of black cars surrounding him, and a man with an eyepatch walked out along with a woman,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey Captian America!&rdquo; said the man, Steve turned around and as he did he laid eyes upon the woman, His grew wide, she resembled the woman he had lost so long ago.&nbsp;</p>",
