I bursted into tears the moment Sansa ran into him, offered him a warm embrace and he hugged her back. The emotional weight of that scene, I could find no word to describe it. Alfie and Sophie totally nailed it with their brilliant acting. To me, it\u2019s the best moment in S8 so far, because it is profoundly touching and very multi-layered. It\u2019s not only about the bond between Theon and Sansa, but involves other the important people in their lives, both alive (Bran and Jon) and deceased (Ned, Robb, Rickon, Ser Rodrick, Maester Luwin). That\u2019s the aspect I like about GoT, where characters are interrelated. Those who passed away still have an impact on the lives and decisions of those who remain. And in that sense, they are never forgotten.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40d312dc802202b4ea1e03eeb5ea8969/tumblr_pqck2uylBl1tx2xmso5_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>\n\nGif: <a href=\"https://thesistersstark.tumblr.com/post/184358919367\">thesistersstark</a>\n\n<br/></p><!-- more --><hr><h2>The lie he told himself</h2><p>Despite his status as a ward, Theon was treated with kindness at Winterfell, and Robb considered him his best friend.

Robb Stark always reminded me of that. [&hellip;] <b>It\u2019s Ironborn, that I was born to be.</b> (Theon to Ramsay, 3x04)<br/></p></blockquote><p>When Theon sacked Winterfell and proclaimed himself the Prince of Winterfell, Maester Luwin tried to appeal to the goodness in him by reminding him that Ned had gone out of his way to make Winterfell a home for Theon. He responded aggressively. </p><blockquote><p>Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it\u2019s like to be told how lucky you are to be someone\u2019s prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father\u2026 (Theon to Maester Luwin, 2x10)</p></blockquote><p>But was it true? Or Theon was just lying to himself to make his act of betrayal less painful?

Jon\u2019s kind words encouraged Theon to overcome his fear to go rescue Yara.<br/></p><hr><h2>Theon had a safer option<br/></h2><p>After rescuing Yara, Theon could have chosen to go to the Iron Islands with his sister and take back their home, wait out the winter in a place the Dead cannot go.

He was very patient and never gave up on Theon, and used every chance possible to remind the heir of the Iron Islands of the goodness inside him. Maester Luwin even tried to interfere when Theon was beaten down and captured by his men to be handed to Ramsay, and was fatally wounded as a result.

(Reek, A Dance with Dragons)</p></blockquote><p>Although it is not apparent in the books about Theon\u2019s fondness for Sansa herself, the show made it quite obvious about his deep affection for her. Theon was totally broken and scared under Ramsay\u2019s hands, he allowed himself to be treated like a loyal dog to his master, until Sansa came back to his life. She reminded him of who he was, his pride as a Greyjoy, that he was part of the Stark family.

To Sansa, Theon is like a brother, a best friend, who shares with her the most traumatic secrets.

But if in the end, Theon proves that a broken man like him can eventually amend his mistakes and become a brave and honorable person, the first person we should thank is Maester Luwin. He was very patient and never gave up on Theon, and used every chance possible to remind the heir of the Iron Islands of the goodness inside him. Maester Luwin even tried to interfere when Theon was beaten down and captured by his men to be handed to Ramsay, and was fatally wounded as a result. Doing the right thing, be the right kind of person is how Theon can pay tribute to Maester Luwin\u2019s kindness.<br></p><p>Moreover, Bran was the Stark kid Maester Luwin spent the most time with. He had a lot of affection for Bran and tried to groom the little boy into a good lord. In his dying breath, the maester reminded Bran that there was still hope as long as he lived.

With braveness, he looked Theon in the eyes and asked if his surrogate brother in fact hated the Starks all the time.

Since season 5, when their paths cross at Winterfell, this question has been raised. Even\u00a0\u2018though giving Sansa Jeyne\u2019s Winterfell storyline was a divergence from the books, I beleve the show writers did this for a reason: to highlight Sansa\u2019s relationship with both <a href=\"https://springwolvesofwinterfell.tumblr.com/post/184190307639/how-a-non-shipper-senses-jonsa\">Jon</a> and Theon.\u00a0</p><p>Like Jon, Theon longed to be seen as part of the Stark family and he endured the pain of feeling unworthy and being an outsider. As a child, he even dreamed of having Sansa\u2019s hands in marriage, so that he could become Ned\u2019s son.</p><blockquote><p>He remembered a time when he had thought that <b>Lord Eddard Stark might marry him to Sansa and claim him for a son</b>, but that had only been a child\u2019s fancy. (Reek, A Dance with Dragons)</p></blockquote><p>Although it is not apparent in the books about Theon\u2019s fondness for Sansa herself, the show made it quite obvious about his deep affection for her. Theon was totally broken and scared under Ramsay\u2019s hands, he allowed himself to be treated like a loyal dog to his master, until Sansa came back to his life. She reminded him of who he was, his pride as a Greyjoy, that he was part of the Stark family. Gradually, she was able to convince him to pick up his strength again and break free from their abuser.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"216\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1cddc3bcec444fabea3dba4276d98ab/tumblr_inline_pqerpcCzGf1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"768\" data-orig-height=\"216\"></figure><p>Sansa has made the impossible possible.

Many audience interpreted it as romantic, but I see it as<b> trust, comfort and empathy</b>. There are certain things that only these two could understand and share with one another, because they suffered the same. To Sansa, Theon is like a brother, a best friend, who shares with her the most traumatic secrets. The affection Theon has for Sansa, I believe it\u2019s a mix of familial love, profound friendship, adoration and a hint of romantic feelings for a lady. This is a deep, unique and special kind of bond that goes beyond pure romance. </p><p>This is just my interpretation: I do think that this scene is not only about Sansa and Theon alone. Coupling with her concerned look during the war council (which was clearly in focus), Sansa is worried that Bran is putting himself in an extremely dangerous position, and Theon will be the one guarding Bran. So <b>Sansa is entrusting Theon to protect their little brother</b>. From her look, I would read it as \u201c<i>I trust you. Please keep Bran safe for me. And keep yourself safe too.</i>\u201d <b>Theon finally has the right to protect Bran as a brother.</b> He will do his best to keep Bran unharmed, Robb can rest in peace now.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/61e3a37f209e80d6c8f26634a89bfb32/tumblr_pqcgo8jwIP1wd9douo3_r2_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"http://captainmarvels.tumblr.com/post/184357847825\">captainmarvels</a>\n\n</p><h2><i>My sword is yours, in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.</i></h2><h2><i><b>Am I your brother</b>, now and always?<br><b>Now and always.</b></i></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"212\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e370fbff89f7e729e6665de7eb0c48b2/tumblr_inline_pqio1w7HEa1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"212\"></figure><hr><p>Theon has been through an incredible redemption arc.

It\u2019s not only about the bond between Theon and Sansa, but involves other the important people in their lives, both alive (Bran and Jon) and deceased (Ned, Robb, Rickon, Ser Rodrick, Maester Luwin). That\u2019s the aspect I like about GoT, where characters are interrelated. Those who passed away still have an impact on the lives and decisions of those who remain.

Theon was totally broken and scared under Ramsay\u2019s hands, he allowed himself to be treated like a loyal dog to his master, until Sansa came back to his life.

Many audience interpreted it as romantic, but I see it as<b> trust, comfort and empathy</b>. There are certain things that only these two could understand and share with one another, because they suffered the same. To Sansa, Theon is like a brother, a best friend, who shares with her the most traumatic secrets. The affection Theon has for Sansa, I believe it\u2019s a mix of familial love, profound friendship, adoration and a hint of romantic feelings for a lady. This is a deep, unique and special kind of bond that goes beyond pure romance. </p><p>This is just my interpretation: I do think that this scene is not only about Sansa and Theon alone. Coupling with her concerned look during the war council (which was clearly in focus), Sansa is worried that Bran is putting himself in an extremely dangerous position, and Theon will be the one guarding Bran. So <b>Sansa is entrusting Theon to protect their little brother</b>. From her look, I would read it as \u201c<i>I trust you. Please keep Bran safe for me. And keep yourself safe too.</i>\u201d <b>Theon finally has the right to protect Bran as a brother.</b> He will do his best to keep Bran unharmed, Robb can rest in peace now.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/61e3a37f209e80d6c8f26634a89bfb32/tumblr_pqcgo8jwIP1wd9douo3_r2_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"300\"></figure><p>Gif:\u00a0<a href=\"http://captainmarvels.tumblr.com/post/184357847825\">captainmarvels</a>\n\n</p><h2><i>My sword is yours, in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.</i></h2><h2><i><b>Am I your brother</b>, now and always?<br><b>Now and always.</b></i></h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"212\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e370fbff89f7e729e6665de7eb0c48b2/tumblr_inline_pqio1w7HEa1v86ltz_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"212\"></figure><hr><p>Theon has been through an incredible redemption arc.

Alfie and Sophie totally nailed it with their brilliant acting. To me, it&rsquo;s the best moment in S8 so far, because it is profoundly touching and very multi-layered. It&rsquo;s not only about the bond between Theon and Sansa, but involves other the important people in their lives, both alive (Bran and Jon) and deceased (Ned, Robb, Rickon, Ser Rodrick, Maester Luwin). That&rsquo;s the aspect I like about GoT, where characters are interrelated. Those who passed away still have an impact on the lives and decisions of those who remain.

He is no longer the coward who is always scared and runs away. He chooses to face his past crimes and the people he wronged. He chooses to fight in the most dangerous place in the world, over his own safety in a place the Dead cannot reach. \n\n<br /></p><p>For the love of Winterfell, his once home, the place where he grew up with his surrogate brothers and sisters, where he tasted his short-lived victory after sacking the castle and proclaiming himself Prince of Winterfell, where he suffered the worst traumas of his life as a punishment for his crimes.</p><p>For the love of Ned, the father figure who raised him to be an honorable person.</p><p>For the love of Robb, his brother and his King, who he swore to fight for, and yet betrayed.</p><p>For the love of Bran, the little brother he once wronged,</p><p>For the love of Sansa, the sister who&rsquo;s been through the hardest time with him, who helped bring back his sense of self.</p><p>For the respect of Jon, the friend who always chooses to do the right thing in his eyes.</p><p>For Rickon, Maester Luwin, Ser Rodrik, and the two farm boys he murdered, &hellip;</p><p>There was a time it mattered for Theon to define himself as a Stark or a Greyjoy, which side he should choose, but <b>once he is sure of his heart, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how he calls himself anymore</b>.<b> What really matters is who he truly cares for, and who he wants to protect.</b> That&rsquo;s the power of love, the power that mends a broken person, the power that inspires and transforms him into a brave one.\n\n</p><blockquote><p><i>If a man knows what he is, and remains true to himself, the choice is no choice at all.

Now he&rsquo;s back to her side in a difficult time when they are at the edge of life and death, Sansa rejoices. For her, it&rsquo;s like getting back a long lost family member. The moment she embraced Theon, he was not only forgiven. He was accepted back to the pack, despite being no true wolf.</p><p>From now on, he was no longer seen as an outsider. <b>He has the right to defend Winterfell and its people like a true Stark. </b>He has become one of them.

Many audience interpreted it as romantic, but I see it as<b> trust, comfort and empathy</b>. There are certain things that only these two could understand and share with one another, because they suffered the same. To Sansa, Theon is like a brother, a best friend, who shares with her the most traumatic secrets. The affection Theon has for Sansa, I believe it&rsquo;s a mix of familial love, profound friendship, adoration and a hint of romantic feelings for a lady. This is a deep, unique and special kind of bond that goes beyond pure romance. </p><p>This is just my interpretation: I do think that this scene is not only about Sansa and Theon alone. Coupling with her concerned look during the war council (which was clearly in focus), Sansa is worried that Bran is putting himself in an extremely dangerous position, and Theon will be the one guarding Bran. So <b>Sansa is entrusting Theon to protect their little brother</b>. From her look, I would read it as &ldquo;<i>I trust you. Please keep Bran safe for me. And keep yourself safe too.</i>&rdquo; <b>Theon finally has the right to protect Bran as a brother.</b> He will do his best to keep Bran unharmed, Robb can rest in peace now.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/61e3a37f209e80d6c8f26634a89bfb32/tumblr_pqcgo8jwIP1wd9douo3_r2_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Gif:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://captainmarvels.tumblr.com/post/184357847825\">captainmarvels</a>\n\n</p><h2><i>My sword is yours, in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.</i></h2><h2><i><b>Am I your brother</b>, now and always?<br /><b>Now and always.</b></i></h2><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e370fbff89f7e729e6665de7eb0c48b2/tumblr_inline_pqio1w7HEa1v86ltz_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><hr /><p>Theon has been through an incredible redemption arc. He&rsquo;s grown from one of the most disliked characters to one of the most compelling characters. His journey proves that <b>anyone can be forgiven, if he contrites and tries his best to amend for his mistakes</b>. I hope that we would see more of the heroic acts from Theon, for as long as possible. After all the pains GoT have us endure, seeing a character like Theon stand up and be back to the good side is what the audience rightly deserve.<br /></p></p>",

I bursted into tears the moment Sansa ran into him, offered him a warm embrace and he hugged her back. The emotional weight of that scene, I could find no word to describe it. Alfie and Sophie totally nailed it with their brilliant acting. To me, it&rsquo;s the best moment in S8 so far, because it is profoundly touching and very multi-layered. It&rsquo;s not only about the bond between Theon and Sansa, but involves other the important people in their lives, both alive (Bran and Jon) and deceased (Ned, Robb, Rickon, Ser Rodrick, Maester Luwin). That&rsquo;s the aspect I like about GoT, where characters are interrelated. Those who passed away still have an impact on the lives and decisions of those who remain. And in that sense, they are never forgotten.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40d312dc802202b4ea1e03eeb5ea8969/tumblr_pqck2uylBl1tx2xmso5_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\n\nGif: <a href=\"https://thesistersstark.tumblr.com/post/184358919367\">thesistersstark</a>\n\n<br /></p>\n</p>",
