Ned had taught you everything you could possibly know about Star Wars&hellip; Even though you were yet to actually watch the films. And he&rsquo;d been there to direct you around the typical ways of his school life, something that had you in fits of laughter and in deep interest whenever he had his moments of intellect. But Peter was another story. You didn&rsquo;t realise how much you needed another half to your spidery antics. It was good to have someone to try out the suit features with and to talk about web fluid to without feeling under authority like you normally did. He was you in every sense of the word but so different in every other way. He had a different story with a mirrored plot. And you&rsquo;d ended up spending all of your days with him recently.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re getting on well,&rdquo; You nod to Tony, nudging at the Chinese food in your takeaway pot with absent insentive, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good guy,&rdquo;</p><p>Stark cocks a brow at you and peers at your reaction over his food, &ldquo;So you like him, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You roll your eyes, &ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying,&rdquo; He raises his hands, &ldquo;You two seem to be spending a lot of time together without me forcing you,&rdquo;</p><p>You push your fork into a piece of chicken and lift it up, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had become somewhat of a father figure to you. Originally, both of you had completely denied it. But in his protectiveness, his teaching and his presence, he&rsquo;d become the Dad you didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ever have. You usually liked your dynamic&hellip; Until it got to moments like this.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now,&rdquo; You mutter, pushing your leftover food towards him before he asks for it, &ldquo;And before you ask about where I&rsquo;m going, it&rsquo;s just studying,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start lying to m-&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s no use. You&rsquo;ve already slammed the door.</p><p>~~~</p><p>On recent evenings, you and Peter had been teaming up to go and make the most of your suits and abilities. You would come up with stupid challenges and occasionally even helping out with a few neighbourhood ongoings. </p><p>&ldquo;Psst,&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s sound is only just audible over the street noise as you walk down the street, finding no oddity in the fact that you were completely dressed in your suit.</p><p>You glance up to see him perched on a ledge of the building above you, his legs swinging down and his demeanour looking oddly mysterious in the low lighting. It is in the blink of the eye that you are up there to join him, falling into the same posture.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; You ask, his arm brushing against yours enough for you to be thankful that this suit hid your goosebumps.</p><p>&ldquo;I say we go for a climb,&rdquo; Peter nods with an assertive confidence that only ever shone through when he became spiderman and no longer the typical schoolboy. </p><p>You raise your brows and watch as he swings himself from the ledge, swinging across to the adjacent building and the next and the next until the two of you reach a tower that is taller than you&rsquo;d want to admit. Yes, superheroes could still be afraid of heights. </p><p>Peter wiggles his brows, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it for ages but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty scary,&rdquo; You laugh, responding to a statement he was reluctant to say. You see the way he relaxes a little more. </p><p>The two of you stand in silence for a little longer, both questioning this in your head. Tony, or Mr Stark to Peter, would probably kill you. Good job he wasn&rsquo;t here&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; You shrug, shooting your trusty web to latch yourself to the smooth brick of the tower, another web catching higher to pull you further up.</p><p>Peter hesitates but was quick to follow, trying his best to keep up with your streamlined pace.</p><p>You connect your web with the balcony that hung out from the tower and swing yourself onto it, catching your hands on the metal structure with utter relief that your climb had been terminated.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy sh-&rdquo; Peter begins but breaks into a laugh that stops him from finishing that exclamatory.</p><p>You laugh too because one thing you&rsquo;d learnt about Parker was he had a ridiculously infectious laugh. You weren&rsquo;t complaining.</p><p>&ldquo;God this is high,&rdquo; He mumbles, eyes scanning across the wide view of the city in front of you, all slowly becoming lit by a nighttime routine. </p><p>You hum in agreeance and find yourself reaching for his hand, the contact in your intertwined fingers making you feel a little more grounded. Peter evidently tenses at the touch before he welcomes the feeling, letting his hand mould perfectly to yours. </p><p>&ldquo;Tony keeps asking about you,&rdquo; You comment, your eyes averting from the city landscape to glance at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Re-really? Why?&rdquo; Peter stutters, his free hand scratching at the back of his neck through the suit.</p><p>&ldquo;He thinks we like each other,&rdquo; You smirk and watch the evident surprise in Peter&rsquo;s reaction, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be careful, he can get pretty protective when he wants to be,&rdquo; With that, you drop yourself from the edge of the balcony, letting your web catch you from your fall and swinging across before attaching to a lower part to pull yourself down further until you eventually collide with the ground, flipping to reduce the harsh impact.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop doing that!&rdquo; Peter exclaims when he catches up, &ldquo;I always think you&rsquo;re falling,&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckle and tug the hood of your suit from your head, shaking your hair out and welcoming the cool breeze brushing through your recently enclosed locks. Peter does the same and you&rsquo;re definitely certain his hair looks millions better than yours. His hair always looked pretty damn perfect. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning, Parker,&rdquo; You smile, pressing an impromptu kiss to his cheek before turning away to head back &lsquo;home&rsquo; to Tony. Your companion was certainly glad you couldn&rsquo;t see the furious red blush on his face, something that felt brighter than the crimson of his suit.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It was only the next day when you returned to school and fell into the typical step down the corridor with Peter and Ned. Ned stood in the middle of you two, chatting about something that currently held all of his interest but, sadly, something you also knew nothing about. As much as possible, you tried to keep up with his in-depth knowledge on the subject but the extensive use of terminology fell short of your attention span for a Friday morning. Instead, you couldn&rsquo;t help but notice how Peter&rsquo;s eyes kept catching with yours and lingering there for a moment too long. They were always far too short lived forever as his gaze was broken by someone walking the other way down the corridor and breaking up your row formation. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, this is me,&rdquo; You mention, directing yourself toward the calc class, &ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;ll see you in chem?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter nods in response, &ldquo;Ye-yeah, totally,&rdquo;</p><p>He internally kicked himself for the crappy response. But you were already gone.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long. The threads of hair on your forearm standing to loyal attention. The blood rushing in your ears appearing to accelerate just a little too much. The unnatural strength to the clench in your fist.</p><p><i>Shit</i>. You needed to go. </p><p>With overwhelming instincts to encourage you, you bolt up from that chair and get out of the class as quickly as possible, only running as soon as the prying eyes of your classmates no longer had view of you. Unsurprisingly, you see Peter only a few paces ahead, clearly with the same spidery instincts to persistently force him to follow them. </p><p>He glances over his shoulder and picks up his pace a little, hurrying out of school and down the street. It is the little glances over his shoulder as he hurries that make you laugh, wanting to pick up your pace more and more.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You hiss, jogging to catch up as he pushes through a back alley gate and breaks into a sort of run.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, (Y/l/n)!&rdquo; He turns around so he&rsquo;s jogging backwards, his eyes focused on you.</p><p>You cock a brow and run at him, flipping over him and just about grazing his hair as you land in front of him, stopping his steps all together.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, Parker,&rdquo; You smirk and he looks at you with blinking eyes for just a second before breaking into a bold grin. </p><p>&ldquo;So you got the same instinct?&rdquo; He brings you back down to the task at hand, tugging at the shoes on his feet and reaching for his suit from the bag.</p><p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; You nod before silently following his actions to change into the suit that matched his.</p><p>It made your heart flip a little when he was respectful enough to turn around as soon as you started to change, waiting with his eyes on the wall until you said anything more.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good, Peter,&rdquo; You comment, pressing on the chest of your suit to fit it to your body.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, yeah, well I just wanted to make sure I-&rdquo; He scratches at the back of his neck, looking down to kick his feet against the ground.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter?&rdquo; You smile, waiting until he looks back up at you, &ldquo;I appreciate it. Can we go now?&rdquo;</p><p>He nods enthusiastically before hurrying to follow you down the rest of the corridor, following your trusty spidey sense to reach closer to your destination. </p><p>You two chase your way through the Brooklyn city streets to reach your desired destination and you instantly see the way Peter&rsquo;s demeanour changes.</p><p>&ldquo;Vulture&rdquo; He mutters under his breath and you instantly whip your head round to look at him, &ldquo;I think I should handle this,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo; You scoff, &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s already told me everything,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter goes to respond but it all happens too quickly as a bone shattering grip lifts you from the ground with no chance of avoidance.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/n)!&rdquo; Peter screams, shooting his web towards the Vulture with no success.</p><p>Your legs kick viciously at the metal death clasp you were locked in, each movement being defeated by the overwhelming strength that consumed you.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t see your companion now, only hear the repetitive defeats in each of his attempts to save you. But you can feel yourself ascending, moving through the air without any orientation for where.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You yell and the ringing in your ears is almost enough to drown out the overwhelming strangled sound to your desperation.</p><p>He&rsquo;s chasing you but with no success. And then you&rsquo;re falling. Your agile body tearing freely through the still air at a pace you didn&rsquo;t want to imagine.</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s voice but you can&rsquo;t make out where it comes from before you plummet to the ground, smacking against the concrete in a deathly blow. Your ears sound with a mind blowing ring, one that you feel in every inch of your body. Your legs are being weighed down by an aching desire to remain still and prevent all possible movement. Your hair feels stickier against your hood with a pooling blood you were dreading to see.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no,&rdquo; You hear Peter&rsquo;s voice repeating as he runs over to you, crouching down beside your still form to check upon your state. He&rsquo;s pulled back in a matter of seconds, ripping away from you with another deathly grip from Vulture. The enemy throws him to the side like discarded metal before powering over to you once again with sickening intent. You&rsquo;re lifted once more into his grip, whipping through the air again until you feel Peter&rsquo;s resistance - the web latching onto his metal structure and pulling back any strong movements that would drag you further away from him.</p><p>Your one arm is thankfully free this time, the Vulture&rsquo;s grip cold against your covered hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You scream like it is the only word you&rsquo;re capable of saying.</p><p>He focuses on you, web shooter directed at yours as they&rsquo;re both shot at the same time. In an odd moment of hopeful logic, your webs intertwine with enough force to direct fully at the Vulture, wrapping around him and the surprise loosening his grip instantly. And then you&rsquo;re falling again. This time into something that felt harsher than any concrete. You couldn&rsquo;t fall into the water. This goddamn suit wasn&rsquo;t made for water. But Tony was smart enough for web wings to be an invention. Their instant loyalty spreads from your sides, catching you in a drift with your body just inches from the body of water beneath you. You catch yourself through the air, drifting across the light wind and circling back round to the fight at hand.</p><p>The Vulture was backing away now, stumbling away from you and Peter before flying away. Neither of you had the insentive to follow. You knew he&rsquo;d eventually return.</p><p>You drop your web wings, falling to the ground in a forward roll before letting your body slump against the warm concrete floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, (Y/n), are you okay?&rdquo; Peter hurries to your side, his hand catching on your shoulders like he needed some contact to know you were actually there.</p><p>You groan and lift up your arm to tug the hood from your head, dropping your arm back to the floor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pulls his hood off too, running a hand through his untamed locks, &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo;</p><p>You frown at him and push up onto your elbows, &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get you home,&rdquo; He nods, standing up and reaching his arms underneath your shoulders to lift you up.</p><p>It was an odd response. And even more odd was his silence on your entire journey home.</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Well? What the fuck happened?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice is far too harsh for your ringing ears as you&rsquo;re slumped in a chair without any intention of having this conversation now.</p><p>&ldquo;It was my fault sir. I should&rsquo;ve been more cautious and I wasn&rsquo;t an-&rdquo; Peter rambles, dropping his hands down to his sides, &ldquo;And, like I said, it wasn&rsquo;t her,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that Peter,&rdquo; You break in, shifting in the chair and trying your best to focus on the situation even with the ringing still in your ears, &ldquo;I said I wanted to help,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of you should be getting involved! I told you to stay out of it!&rdquo; Tony snaps, head flicking between the two of you with an annoyingly fatherly irritation.</p><p>&ldquo;And do what instead? Sit back and let the bad guys take over?&rdquo; You laugh, &ldquo;Yeah because I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the motto you live by, Tony,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks away from you in a moment you wanted him to support. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, come on! We&rsquo;re not just kids! We&rsquo;re spiderpeople or whatever shit name you want to give us,&rdquo; You let out an anger fueled laugh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your decision what we can and cannot do,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, go home and take that goddamn suit off, I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything like this happening again,&rdquo; Tony waves him off.</p><p>Peter stands there for only a second before walking away. You expect him to at least look at you - nothing.</p><p>You go to stand up too, hoping to find a moment of prolonged peace away from Tony&rsquo;s fury fueled eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you could go,&rdquo; Tony stops you, his stance relaxing despite his harsh tone, &ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, we&rsquo;ve been through this,&rdquo; You sigh, pinching the bridge of your nose and sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; He shakes his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Peter tell me it was him. I want to know why you were even close enough for the Vulture to get to you, hm?&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t respond, &ldquo;There are reasons why I want to keep you away from that, (Y/n) and there are reasons why you should listen,&rdquo;</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>&ldquo;When I found you however many years ago, you were just a girl scared of why she could beat all of the older kids at arm wrestling. And why you suddenly ran faster than them and got these weird moments where you felt like some strange sixth sense was controlling you,&rdquo; He sighs, &ldquo;I promised myself I&rsquo;d protect you and teach you how to cope with those things that scared you. I did that, I really really tried and I did that. I had to learn how to be like a Dad and I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when I got my first period?&rdquo; You laugh, &ldquo;You locked me in your stupid basement thing with all of the suits and you bought out an entire shop of everything that could help. You were terrified!&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles and looks down at his feet, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have bad hormones!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How bad did you think they&rsquo;d be?!&rdquo; You exclaim and for a moment the two of you have a gentle laughter that settles into a welcome silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I brought you here so you&rsquo;d have someone other than me. So Peter could learn from you and you from him. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to go against me,&rdquo; Tony mumbles and its one of those statements that lets your heart drop faster than you did to that concrete.</p><p>You push yourself to stand up from the chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I am. But I want to help. Just like you do, just like I should do. And Peter is a good guy and we work well together,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods and clasps his hands in front of him, a typical businessman gesture that he still hadn&rsquo;t lost.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll speak to you about it next time, okay?&rdquo; You clasp his shoulder and you&rsquo;re thankful that he can take a little bit of your weight in your weakened state.</p><p>&ldquo;And tell me before you go on a date with Parker, alright?&rdquo; He cocks a brow and you hit him with a gentle force.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now,&rdquo; You say quickly, heading toward your room with intent to get away as quickly as possible.</p><p>~~~</p><p>You&rsquo;re laying on your bed with hope of absorbing as much information on exothermic and endothermic reactions as humanly possible but none of it seems to be working.</p><p>Your hand hovered over your phone beside you and you felt as though part of you was physically pulling toward messaging Peter.</p><p><i>'Are you struggling with this as much as I am?!&rsquo; </i></p><p>You message it with an innocent photo of the spilling papers in front of you.</p><p>Wait. Wait. No response.</p><p>Okay, maybe you were exaggerating the wait.</p><p><i>'We can do it in the morning x&rsquo;</i></p><p>You smile at his asssurance - that would probably mean he&rsquo;d already completed it and he&rsquo;d help you with the answers tomorrow. It is his next message that surprises you.</p><p><i>'Can you come round? I think we need to talk.&rsquo;</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>(I really can&rsquo;t decide if I like this so please, more than ever, let me know your honest thoughts!!)</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> </p>",

You weren\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u201cGod this is high,\u201d He mumbles, eyes scanning across the wide view of the city in front of you, all slowly becoming lit by a nighttime routine. </p><p>You hum in agreeance and find yourself reaching for his hand, the contact in your intertwined fingers making you feel a little more grounded. Peter evidently tenses at the touch before he welcomes the feeling, letting his hand mould perfectly to yours. </p><p>\u201cTony keeps asking about you,\u201d You comment, your eyes averting from the city landscape to glance at him.</p><p>\u201cRe-really? Why?\u201d Peter stutters, his free hand scratching at the back of his neck through the suit.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we like each other,\u201d You smirk and watch the evident surprise in Peter\u2019s reaction, \u201cI\u2019d be careful, he can get pretty protective when he wants to be,\u201d With that, you drop yourself from the edge of the balcony, letting your web catch you from your fall and swinging across before attaching to a lower part to pull yourself down further until you eventually collide with the ground, flipping to reduce the harsh impact.</p><p>\u201cStop doing that!\u201d Peter exclaims when he catches up, \u201cI always think you\u2019re falling,\u201d</p><p>You chuckle and tug the hood of your suit from your head, shaking your hair out and welcoming the cool breeze brushing through your recently enclosed locks. Peter does the same and you\u2019re definitely certain his hair looks millions better than yours. His hair always looked pretty damn perfect. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning, Parker,\u201d You smile, pressing an impromptu kiss to his cheek before turning away to head back \u2018home\u2019 to Tony. Your companion was certainly glad you couldn\u2019t see the furious red blush on his face, something that felt brighter than the crimson of his suit.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It was only the next day when you returned to school and fell into the typical step down the corridor with Peter and Ned. Ned stood in the middle of you two, chatting about something that currently held all of his interest but, sadly, something you also knew nothing about. As much as possible, you tried to keep up with his in-depth knowledge on the subject but the extensive use of terminology fell short of your attention span for a Friday morning. Instead, you couldn\u2019t help but notice how Peter\u2019s eyes kept catching with yours and lingering there for a moment too long. They were always far too short lived forever as his gaze was broken by someone walking the other way down the corridor and breaking up your row formation. </p><p>\u201cAlright, this is me,\u201d You mention, directing yourself toward the calc class, \u201cPeter, I\u2019ll see you in chem?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods in response, \u201cYe-yeah, totally,\u201d</p><p>He internally kicked himself for the crappy response. But you were already gone.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. The threads of hair on your forearm standing to loyal attention. The blood rushing in your ears appearing to accelerate just a little too much. The unnatural strength to the clench in your fist.</p><p><i>Shit</i>. You needed to go. </p><p>With overwhelming instincts to encourage you, you bolt up from that chair and get out of the class as quickly as possible, only running as soon as the prying eyes of your classmates no longer had view of you. Unsurprisingly, you see Peter only a few paces ahead, clearly with the same spidery instincts to persistently force him to follow them. </p><p>He glances over his shoulder and picks up his pace a little, hurrying out of school and down the street. It is the little glances over his shoulder as he hurries that make you laugh, wanting to pick up your pace more and more.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You hiss, jogging to catch up as he pushes through a back alley gate and breaks into a sort of run.</p><p>\u201cCome on, (Y/l/n)!\u201d He turns around so he\u2019s jogging backwards, his eyes focused on you.</p><p>You cock a brow and run at him, flipping over him and just about grazing his hair as you land in front of him, stopping his steps all together.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Parker,\u201d You smirk and he looks at you with blinking eyes for just a second before breaking into a bold grin. </p><p>\u201cSo you got the same instinct?\u201d He brings you back down to the task at hand, tugging at the shoes on his feet and reaching for his suit from the bag.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d You nod before silently following his actions to change into the suit that matched his.</p><p>It made your heart flip a little when he was respectful enough to turn around as soon as you started to change, waiting with his eyes on the wall until you said anything more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good, Peter,\u201d You comment, pressing on the chest of your suit to fit it to your body.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, yeah, well I just wanted to make sure I-\u201d He scratches at the back of his neck, looking down to kick his feet against the ground.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You smile, waiting until he looks back up at you, \u201cI appreciate it. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>He nods enthusiastically before hurrying to follow you down the rest of the corridor, following your trusty spidey sense to reach closer to your destination. </p><p>You two chase your way through the Brooklyn city streets to reach your desired destination and you instantly see the way Peter\u2019s demeanour changes.</p><p>\u201cVulture\u201d He mutters under his breath and you instantly whip your head round to look at him, \u201cI think I should handle this,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d You scoff, \u201cTony\u2019s already told me everything,\u201d</p><p>Peter goes to respond but it all happens too quickly as a bone shattering grip lifts you from the ground with no chance of avoidance.</p><p>\u201c(Y/n)!\u201d Peter screams, shooting his web towards the Vulture with no success.</p><p>Your legs kick viciously at the metal death clasp you were locked in, each movement being defeated by the overwhelming strength that consumed you.</p><p>You can\u2019t see your companion now, only hear the repetitive defeats in each of his attempts to save you. But you can feel yourself ascending, moving through the air without any orientation for where.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You yell and the ringing in your ears is almost enough to drown out the overwhelming strangled sound to your desperation.</p><p>He\u2019s chasing you but with no success. And then you\u2019re falling. Your agile body tearing freely through the still air at a pace you didn\u2019t want to imagine.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice but you can\u2019t make out where it comes from before you plummet to the ground, smacking against the concrete in a deathly blow. Your ears sound with a mind blowing ring, one that you feel in every inch of your body. Your legs are being weighed down by an aching desire to remain still and prevent all possible movement. Your hair feels stickier against your hood with a pooling blood you were dreading to see.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d You hear Peter\u2019s voice repeating as he runs over to you, crouching down beside your still form to check upon your state. He\u2019s pulled back in a matter of seconds, ripping away from you with another deathly grip from Vulture. The enemy throws him to the side like discarded metal before powering over to you once again with sickening intent. You\u2019re lifted once more into his grip, whipping through the air again until you feel Peter\u2019s resistance - the web latching onto his metal structure and pulling back any strong movements that would drag you further away from him.</p><p>Your one arm is thankfully free this time, the Vulture\u2019s grip cold against your covered hands.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You scream like it is the only word you\u2019re capable of saying.</p><p>He focuses on you, web shooter directed at yours as they\u2019re both shot at the same time. In an odd moment of hopeful logic, your webs intertwine with enough force to direct fully at the Vulture, wrapping around him and the surprise loosening his grip instantly. And then you\u2019re falling again. This time into something that felt harsher than any concrete. You couldn\u2019t fall into the water. This goddamn suit wasn\u2019t made for water. But Tony was smart enough for web wings to be an invention. Their instant loyalty spreads from your sides, catching you in a drift with your body just inches from the body of water beneath you. You catch yourself through the air, drifting across the light wind and circling back round to the fight at hand.</p><p>The Vulture was backing away now, stumbling away from you and Peter before flying away. Neither of you had the insentive to follow. You knew he\u2019d eventually return.</p><p>You drop your web wings, falling to the ground in a forward roll before letting your body slump against the warm concrete floor. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit, (Y/n), are you okay?\u201d Peter hurries to your side, his hand catching on your shoulders like he needed some contact to know you were actually there.</p><p>You groan and lift up your arm to tug the hood from your head, dropping your arm back to the floor, \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d</p><p>Peter pulls his hood off too, running a hand through his untamed locks, \u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d</p><p>You frown at him and push up onto your elbows, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get you home,\u201d He nods, standing up and reaching his arms underneath your shoulders to lift you up.</p><p>It was an odd response. And even more odd was his silence on your entire journey home.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cWell? What the fuck happened?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice is far too harsh for your ringing ears as you\u2019re slumped in a chair without any intention of having this conversation now.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault sir. I should\u2019ve been more cautious and I wasn\u2019t an-\u201d Peter rambles, dropping his hands down to his sides, \u201cAnd, like I said, it wasn\u2019t her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that Peter,\u201d You break in, shifting in the chair and trying your best to focus on the situation even with the ringing still in your ears, \u201cI said I wanted to help,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of you should be getting involved! I told you to stay out of it!\u201d Tony snaps, head flicking between the two of you with an annoyingly fatherly irritation.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what instead? Sit back and let the bad guys take over?\u201d You laugh, \u201cYeah because I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the motto you live by, Tony,\u201d</p><p>Peter looks away from you in a moment you wanted him to support. </p><p>\u201cI mean, come on! We\u2019re not just kids! We\u2019re spiderpeople or whatever shit name you want to give us,\u201d You let out an anger fueled laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s not your decision what we can and cannot do,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, go home and take that goddamn suit off, I don\u2019t want to hear anything like this happening again,\u201d Tony waves him off.</p><p>Peter stands there for only a second before walking away. You expect him to at least look at you - nothing.</p><p>You go to stand up too, hoping to find a moment of prolonged peace away from Tony\u2019s fury fueled eyes. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could go,\u201d Tony stops you, his stance relaxing despite his harsh tone, \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, we\u2019ve been through this,\u201d You sigh, pinching the bridge of your nose and sighing.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d He shakes his head, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Peter tell me it was him. I want to know why you were even close enough for the Vulture to get to you, hm?\u201d You don\u2019t respond, \u201cThere are reasons why I want to keep you away from that, (Y/n) and there are reasons why you should listen,\u201d</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>\u201cWhen I found you however many years ago, you were just a girl scared of why she could beat all of the older kids at arm wrestling. And why you suddenly ran faster than them and got these weird moments where you felt like some strange sixth sense was controlling you,\u201d He sighs, \u201cI promised myself I\u2019d protect you and teach you how to cope with those things that scared you. I did that, I really really tried and I did that. I had to learn how to be like a Dad and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I got my first period?\u201d You laugh, \u201cYou locked me in your stupid basement thing with all of the suits and you bought out an entire shop of everything that could help. You were terrified!\u201d</p><p>He chuckles and looks down at his feet, \u201cI thought you\u2019d have bad hormones!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad did you think they\u2019d be?!\u201d You exclaim and for a moment the two of you have a gentle laughter that settles into a welcome silence.</p><p>\u201cI brought you here so you\u2019d have someone other than me. So Peter could learn from you and you from him. I didn\u2019t expect you to go against me,\u201d Tony mumbles and its one of those statements that lets your heart drop faster than you did to that concrete.</p><p>You push yourself to stand up from the chair, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am. But I want to help. Just like you do, just like I should do. And Peter is a good guy and we work well together,\u201d</p><p>Tony nods and clasps his hands in front of him, a typical businessman gesture that he still hadn\u2019t lost.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll speak to you about it next time, okay?\u201d You clasp his shoulder and you\u2019re thankful that he can take a little bit of your weight in your weakened state.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell me before you go on a date with Parker, alright?\u201d He cocks a brow and you hit him with a gentle force.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d You say quickly, heading toward your room with intent to get away as quickly as possible.</p><p>~~~</p><p>You\u2019re laying on your bed with hope of absorbing as much information on exothermic and endothermic reactions as humanly possible but none of it seems to be working.</p><p>Your hand hovered over your phone beside you and you felt as though part of you was physically pulling toward messaging Peter.</p><p><i>'Are you struggling with this as much as I am?!\u2019 </i></p><p>You message it with an innocent photo of the spilling papers in front of you.</p><p>Wait. Wait. No response.</p><p>Okay, maybe you were exaggerating the wait.</p><p><i>'We can do it in the morning x\u2019</i></p><p>You smile at his asssurance - that would probably mean he\u2019d already completed it and he\u2019d help you with the answers tomorrow. It is his next message that surprises you.</p><p><i>'Can you come round? I think we need to talk.\u2019</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>(I really can\u2019t decide if I like this so please, more than ever, let me know your honest thoughts!!)</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> </p></p>",

Ned had taught you everything you could possibly know about Star Wars\u2026 Even though you were yet to actually watch the films. And he\u2019d been there to direct you around the typical ways of his school life, something that had you in fits of laughter and in deep interest whenever he had his moments of intellect. But Peter was another story. You didn\u2019t realise how much you needed another half to your spidery antics. It was good to have someone to try out the suit features with and to talk about web fluid to without feeling under authority like you normally did. He was you in every sense of the word but so different in every other way. He had a different story with a mirrored plot. And you\u2019d ended up spending all of your days with him recently.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re getting on well,\u201d You nod to Tony, nudging at the Chinese food in your takeaway pot with absent insentive, \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d</p><p>Stark cocks a brow at you and peers at your reaction over his food, \u201cSo you like him, huh?\u201d</p><p>You roll your eyes, \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d He raises his hands, \u201cYou two seem to be spending a lot of time together without me forcing you,\u201d</p><p>You push your fork into a piece of chicken and lift it up, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d</p><p>Tony had become somewhat of a father figure to you. Originally, both of you had completely denied it. But in his protectiveness, his teaching and his presence, he\u2019d become the Dad you didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever have. You usually liked your dynamic\u2026 Until it got to moments like this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d You mutter, pushing your leftover food towards him before he asks for it, \u201cAnd before you ask about where I\u2019m going, it\u2019s just studying,\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start lying to m-\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s no use. You\u2019ve already slammed the door.</p><p>~~~</p><p>On recent evenings, you and Peter had been teaming up to go and make the most of your suits and abilities. You would come up with stupid challenges and occasionally even helping out with a few neighbourhood ongoings. </p><p>\u201cPsst,\u201d Peter\u2019s sound is only just audible over the street noise as you walk down the street, finding no oddity in the fact that you were completely dressed in your suit.</p><p>You glance up to see him perched on a ledge of the building above you, his legs swinging down and his demeanour looking oddly mysterious in the low lighting. It is in the blink of the eye that you are up there to join him, falling into the same posture.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d You ask, his arm brushing against yours enough for you to be thankful that this suit hid your goosebumps.</p><p>\u201cI say we go for a climb,\u201d Peter nods with an assertive confidence that only ever shone through when he became spiderman and no longer the typical schoolboy. </p><p>You raise your brows and watch as he swings himself from the ledge, swinging across to the adjacent building and the next and the next until the two of you reach a tower that is taller than you\u2019d want to admit. Yes, superheroes could still be afraid of heights. </p><p>Peter wiggles his brows, \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do it for ages but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty scary,\u201d You laugh, responding to a statement he was reluctant to say. You see the way he relaxes a little more. </p><p>The two of you stand in silence for a little longer, both questioning this in your head. Tony, or Mr Stark to Peter, would probably kill you. Good job he wasn\u2019t here\u2026</p><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d You shrug, shooting your trusty web to latch yourself to the smooth brick of the tower, another web catching higher to pull you further up.</p><p>Peter hesitates but was quick to follow, trying his best to keep up with your streamlined pace.</p><p>You connect your web with the balcony that hung out from the tower and swing yourself onto it, catching your hands on the metal structure with utter relief that your climb had been terminated.</p><p>\u201cHoly sh-\u201d Peter begins but breaks into a laugh that stops him from finishing that exclamatory.</p><p>You laugh too because one thing you\u2019d learnt about Parker was he had a ridiculously infectious laugh. You weren\u2019t complaining.</p><p>\u201cGod this is high,\u201d He mumbles, eyes scanning across the wide view of the city in front of you, all slowly becoming lit by a nighttime routine. </p><p>You hum in agreeance and find yourself reaching for his hand, the contact in your intertwined fingers making you feel a little more grounded. Peter evidently tenses at the touch before he welcomes the feeling, letting his hand mould perfectly to yours. </p><p>\u201cTony keeps asking about you,\u201d You comment, your eyes averting from the city landscape to glance at him.</p><p>\u201cRe-really? Why?\u201d Peter stutters, his free hand scratching at the back of his neck through the suit.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we like each other,\u201d You smirk and watch the evident surprise in Peter\u2019s reaction, \u201cI\u2019d be careful, he can get pretty protective when he wants to be,\u201d With that, you drop yourself from the edge of the balcony, letting your web catch you from your fall and swinging across before attaching to a lower part to pull yourself down further until you eventually collide with the ground, flipping to reduce the harsh impact.</p><p>\u201cStop doing that!\u201d Peter exclaims when he catches up, \u201cI always think you\u2019re falling,\u201d</p><p>You chuckle and tug the hood of your suit from your head, shaking your hair out and welcoming the cool breeze brushing through your recently enclosed locks. Peter does the same and you\u2019re definitely certain his hair looks millions better than yours. His hair always looked pretty damn perfect. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning, Parker,\u201d You smile, pressing an impromptu kiss to his cheek before turning away to head back \u2018home\u2019 to Tony. Your companion was certainly glad you couldn\u2019t see the furious red blush on his face, something that felt brighter than the crimson of his suit.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It was only the next day when you returned to school and fell into the typical step down the corridor with Peter and Ned. Ned stood in the middle of you two, chatting about something that currently held all of his interest but, sadly, something you also knew nothing about. As much as possible, you tried to keep up with his in-depth knowledge on the subject but the extensive use of terminology fell short of your attention span for a Friday morning. Instead, you couldn\u2019t help but notice how Peter\u2019s eyes kept catching with yours and lingering there for a moment too long. They were always far too short lived forever as his gaze was broken by someone walking the other way down the corridor and breaking up your row formation. </p><p>\u201cAlright, this is me,\u201d You mention, directing yourself toward the calc class, \u201cPeter, I\u2019ll see you in chem?\u201d</p><p>Peter nods in response, \u201cYe-yeah, totally,\u201d</p><p>He internally kicked himself for the crappy response. But you were already gone.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. The threads of hair on your forearm standing to loyal attention. The blood rushing in your ears appearing to accelerate just a little too much. The unnatural strength to the clench in your fist.</p><p><i>Shit</i>. You needed to go. </p><p>With overwhelming instincts to encourage you, you bolt up from that chair and get out of the class as quickly as possible, only running as soon as the prying eyes of your classmates no longer had view of you. Unsurprisingly, you see Peter only a few paces ahead, clearly with the same spidery instincts to persistently force him to follow them. </p><p>He glances over his shoulder and picks up his pace a little, hurrying out of school and down the street. It is the little glances over his shoulder as he hurries that make you laugh, wanting to pick up your pace more and more.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You hiss, jogging to catch up as he pushes through a back alley gate and breaks into a sort of run.</p><p>\u201cCome on, (Y/l/n)!\u201d He turns around so he\u2019s jogging backwards, his eyes focused on you.</p><p>You cock a brow and run at him, flipping over him and just about grazing his hair as you land in front of him, stopping his steps all together.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Parker,\u201d You smirk and he looks at you with blinking eyes for just a second before breaking into a bold grin. </p><p>\u201cSo you got the same instinct?\u201d He brings you back down to the task at hand, tugging at the shoes on his feet and reaching for his suit from the bag.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d You nod before silently following his actions to change into the suit that matched his.</p><p>It made your heart flip a little when he was respectful enough to turn around as soon as you started to change, waiting with his eyes on the wall until you said anything more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good, Peter,\u201d You comment, pressing on the chest of your suit to fit it to your body.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, yeah, well I just wanted to make sure I-\u201d He scratches at the back of his neck, looking down to kick his feet against the ground.</p><p>\u201cPeter?\u201d You smile, waiting until he looks back up at you, \u201cI appreciate it. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>He nods enthusiastically before hurrying to follow you down the rest of the corridor, following your trusty spidey sense to reach closer to your destination. </p><p>You two chase your way through the Brooklyn city streets to reach your desired destination and you instantly see the way Peter\u2019s demeanour changes.</p><p>\u201cVulture\u201d He mutters under his breath and you instantly whip your head round to look at him, \u201cI think I should handle this,\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d You scoff, \u201cTony\u2019s already told me everything,\u201d</p><p>Peter goes to respond but it all happens too quickly as a bone shattering grip lifts you from the ground with no chance of avoidance.</p><p>\u201c(Y/n)!\u201d Peter screams, shooting his web towards the Vulture with no success.</p><p>Your legs kick viciously at the metal death clasp you were locked in, each movement being defeated by the overwhelming strength that consumed you.</p><p>You can\u2019t see your companion now, only hear the repetitive defeats in each of his attempts to save you. But you can feel yourself ascending, moving through the air without any orientation for where.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You yell and the ringing in your ears is almost enough to drown out the overwhelming strangled sound to your desperation.</p><p>He\u2019s chasing you but with no success. And then you\u2019re falling. Your agile body tearing freely through the still air at a pace you didn\u2019t want to imagine.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It\u2019s Peter\u2019s voice but you can\u2019t make out where it comes from before you plummet to the ground, smacking against the concrete in a deathly blow. Your ears sound with a mind blowing ring, one that you feel in every inch of your body. Your legs are being weighed down by an aching desire to remain still and prevent all possible movement. Your hair feels stickier against your hood with a pooling blood you were dreading to see.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d You hear Peter\u2019s voice repeating as he runs over to you, crouching down beside your still form to check upon your state. He\u2019s pulled back in a matter of seconds, ripping away from you with another deathly grip from Vulture. The enemy throws him to the side like discarded metal before powering over to you once again with sickening intent. You\u2019re lifted once more into his grip, whipping through the air again until you feel Peter\u2019s resistance - the web latching onto his metal structure and pulling back any strong movements that would drag you further away from him.</p><p>Your one arm is thankfully free this time, the Vulture\u2019s grip cold against your covered hands.</p><p>\u201cPeter!\u201d You scream like it is the only word you\u2019re capable of saying.</p><p>He focuses on you, web shooter directed at yours as they\u2019re both shot at the same time. In an odd moment of hopeful logic, your webs intertwine with enough force to direct fully at the Vulture, wrapping around him and the surprise loosening his grip instantly. And then you\u2019re falling again. This time into something that felt harsher than any concrete. You couldn\u2019t fall into the water. This goddamn suit wasn\u2019t made for water. But Tony was smart enough for web wings to be an invention. Their instant loyalty spreads from your sides, catching you in a drift with your body just inches from the body of water beneath you. You catch yourself through the air, drifting across the light wind and circling back round to the fight at hand.</p><p>The Vulture was backing away now, stumbling away from you and Peter before flying away. Neither of you had the insentive to follow. You knew he\u2019d eventually return.</p><p>You drop your web wings, falling to the ground in a forward roll before letting your body slump against the warm concrete floor. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit, (Y/n), are you okay?\u201d Peter hurries to your side, his hand catching on your shoulders like he needed some contact to know you were actually there.</p><p>You groan and lift up your arm to tug the hood from your head, dropping your arm back to the floor, \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d</p><p>Peter pulls his hood off too, running a hand through his untamed locks, \u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d</p><p>You frown at him and push up onto your elbows, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay,\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get you home,\u201d He nods, standing up and reaching his arms underneath your shoulders to lift you up.</p><p>It was an odd response. And even more odd was his silence on your entire journey home.</p><p>~~~</p><p>\u201cWell? What the fuck happened?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice is far too harsh for your ringing ears as you\u2019re slumped in a chair without any intention of having this conversation now.</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault sir. I should\u2019ve been more cautious and I wasn\u2019t an-\u201d Peter rambles, dropping his hands down to his sides, \u201cAnd, like I said, it wasn\u2019t her,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t do that Peter,\u201d You break in, shifting in the chair and trying your best to focus on the situation even with the ringing still in your ears, \u201cI said I wanted to help,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of you should be getting involved! I told you to stay out of it!\u201d Tony snaps, head flicking between the two of you with an annoyingly fatherly irritation.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what instead? Sit back and let the bad guys take over?\u201d You laugh, \u201cYeah because I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the motto you live by, Tony,\u201d</p><p>Peter looks away from you in a moment you wanted him to support. </p><p>\u201cI mean, come on! We\u2019re not just kids! We\u2019re spiderpeople or whatever shit name you want to give us,\u201d You let out an anger fueled laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s not your decision what we can and cannot do,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter, go home and take that goddamn suit off, I don\u2019t want to hear anything like this happening again,\u201d Tony waves him off.</p><p>Peter stands there for only a second before walking away. You expect him to at least look at you - nothing.</p><p>You go to stand up too, hoping to find a moment of prolonged peace away from Tony\u2019s fury fueled eyes. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could go,\u201d Tony stops you, his stance relaxing despite his harsh tone, \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony, we\u2019ve been through this,\u201d You sigh, pinching the bridge of your nose and sighing.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d He shakes his head, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Peter tell me it was him. I want to know why you were even close enough for the Vulture to get to you, hm?\u201d You don\u2019t respond, \u201cThere are reasons why I want to keep you away from that, (Y/n) and there are reasons why you should listen,\u201d</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>\u201cWhen I found you however many years ago, you were just a girl scared of why she could beat all of the older kids at arm wrestling. And why you suddenly ran faster than them and got these weird moments where you felt like some strange sixth sense was controlling you,\u201d He sighs, \u201cI promised myself I\u2019d protect you and teach you how to cope with those things that scared you. I did that, I really really tried and I did that. I had to learn how to be like a Dad and I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I got my first period?\u201d You laugh, \u201cYou locked me in your stupid basement thing with all of the suits and you bought out an entire shop of everything that could help. You were terrified!\u201d</p><p>He chuckles and looks down at his feet, \u201cI thought you\u2019d have bad hormones!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad did you think they\u2019d be?!\u201d You exclaim and for a moment the two of you have a gentle laughter that settles into a welcome silence.</p><p>\u201cI brought you here so you\u2019d have someone other than me. So Peter could learn from you and you from him. I didn\u2019t expect you to go against me,\u201d Tony mumbles and its one of those statements that lets your heart drop faster than you did to that concrete.</p><p>You push yourself to stand up from the chair, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am. But I want to help. Just like you do, just like I should do. And Peter is a good guy and we work well together,\u201d</p><p>Tony nods and clasps his hands in front of him, a typical businessman gesture that he still hadn\u2019t lost.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll speak to you about it next time, okay?\u201d You clasp his shoulder and you\u2019re thankful that he can take a little bit of your weight in your weakened state.</p><p>\u201cAnd tell me before you go on a date with Parker, alright?\u201d He cocks a brow and you hit him with a gentle force.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now,\u201d You say quickly, heading toward your room with intent to get away as quickly as possible.</p><p>~~~</p><p>You\u2019re laying on your bed with hope of absorbing as much information on exothermic and endothermic reactions as humanly possible but none of it seems to be working.</p><p>Your hand hovered over your phone beside you and you felt as though part of you was physically pulling toward messaging Peter.</p><p><i>'Are you struggling with this as much as I am?!\u2019 </i></p><p>You message it with an innocent photo of the spilling papers in front of you.</p><p>Wait. Wait. No response.</p><p>Okay, maybe you were exaggerating the wait.</p><p><i>'We can do it in the morning x\u2019</i></p><p>You smile at his asssurance - that would probably mean he\u2019d already completed it and he\u2019d help you with the answers tomorrow. It is his next message that surprises you.</p><p><i>'Can you come round? I think we need to talk.\u2019</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>(I really can\u2019t decide if I like this so please, more than ever, let me know your honest thoughts!!)</p><p>Tags: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> </p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>Unexpected (ii) </h1><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Since that first school day, you had stuck with Peter and Ned. Ned had taught you everything you could possibly know about Star Wars&hellip; Even though you were yet to actually watch the films. And he&rsquo;d been there to direct you around the typical ways of his school life, something that had you in fits of laughter and in deep interest whenever he had his moments of intellect. But Peter was another story. You didn&rsquo;t realise how much you needed another half to your spidery antics. It was good to have someone to try out the suit features with and to talk about web fluid to without feeling under authority like you normally did. He was you in every sense of the word but so different in every other way. He had a different story with a mirrored plot. And you&rsquo;d ended up spending all of your days with him recently.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re getting on well,&rdquo; You nod to Tony, nudging at the Chinese food in your takeaway pot with absent insentive, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good guy,&rdquo;</p><p>Stark cocks a brow at you and peers at your reaction over his food, &ldquo;So you like him, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You roll your eyes, &ldquo;What are you getting at?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying,&rdquo; He raises his hands, &ldquo;You two seem to be spending a lot of time together without me forcing you,&rdquo;</p><p>You push your fork into a piece of chicken and lift it up, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony had become somewhat of a father figure to you. Originally, both of you had completely denied it. But in his protectiveness, his teaching and his presence, he&rsquo;d become the Dad you didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ever have. You usually liked your dynamic&hellip; Until it got to moments like this.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now,&rdquo; You mutter, pushing your leftover food towards him before he asks for it, &ldquo;And before you ask about where I&rsquo;m going, it&rsquo;s just studying,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start lying to m-&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s no use. You&rsquo;ve already slammed the door.</p><p>~~~</p><p>On recent evenings, you and Peter had been teaming up to go and make the most of your suits and abilities. You would come up with stupid challenges and occasionally even helping out with a few neighbourhood ongoings. </p><p>&ldquo;Psst,&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s sound is only just audible over the street noise as you walk down the street, finding no oddity in the fact that you were completely dressed in your suit.</p><p>You glance up to see him perched on a ledge of the building above you, his legs swinging down and his demeanour looking oddly mysterious in the low lighting. It is in the blink of the eye that you are up there to join him, falling into the same posture.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; You ask, his arm brushing against yours enough for you to be thankful that this suit hid your goosebumps.</p><p>&ldquo;I say we go for a climb,&rdquo; Peter nods with an assertive confidence that only ever shone through when he became spiderman and no longer the typical schoolboy. </p><p>You raise your brows and watch as he swings himself from the ledge, swinging across to the adjacent building and the next and the next until the two of you reach a tower that is taller than you&rsquo;d want to admit. Yes, superheroes could still be afraid of heights. </p><p>Peter wiggles his brows, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it for ages but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty scary,&rdquo; You laugh, responding to a statement he was reluctant to say. You see the way he relaxes a little more. </p><p>The two of you stand in silence for a little longer, both questioning this in your head. Tony, or Mr Stark to Peter, would probably kill you. Good job he wasn&rsquo;t here&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; You shrug, shooting your trusty web to latch yourself to the smooth brick of the tower, another web catching higher to pull you further up.</p><p>Peter hesitates but was quick to follow, trying his best to keep up with your streamlined pace.</p><p>You connect your web with the balcony that hung out from the tower and swing yourself onto it, catching your hands on the metal structure with utter relief that your climb had been terminated.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy sh-&rdquo; Peter begins but breaks into a laugh that stops him from finishing that exclamatory.</p><p>You laugh too because one thing you&rsquo;d learnt about Parker was he had a ridiculously infectious laugh. You weren&rsquo;t complaining.</p><p>&ldquo;God this is high,&rdquo; He mumbles, eyes scanning across the wide view of the city in front of you, all slowly becoming lit by a nighttime routine. </p><p>You hum in agreeance and find yourself reaching for his hand, the contact in your intertwined fingers making you feel a little more grounded.

Peter does the same and you&rsquo;re definitely certain his hair looks millions better than yours. His hair always looked pretty damn perfect. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning, Parker,&rdquo; You smile, pressing an impromptu kiss to his cheek before turning away to head back &lsquo;home&rsquo; to Tony. Your companion was certainly glad you couldn&rsquo;t see the furious red blush on his face, something that felt brighter than the crimson of his suit.</p><p>~~~</p><p>It was only the next day when you returned to school and fell into the typical step down the corridor with Peter and Ned.

Your hair feels stickier against your hood with a pooling blood you were dreading to see.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, no,&rdquo; You hear Peter&rsquo;s voice repeating as he runs over to you, crouching down beside your still form to check upon your state. He&rsquo;s pulled back in a matter of seconds, ripping away from you with another deathly grip from Vulture. The enemy throws him to the side like discarded metal before powering over to you once again with sickening intent. You&rsquo;re lifted once more into his grip, whipping through the air again until you feel Peter&rsquo;s resistance - the web latching onto his metal structure and pulling back any strong movements that would drag you further away from him.</p><p>Your one arm is thankfully free this time, the Vulture&rsquo;s grip cold against your covered hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; You scream like it is the only word you&rsquo;re capable of saying.</p><p>He focuses on you, web shooter directed at yours as they&rsquo;re both shot at the same time. In an odd moment of hopeful logic, your webs intertwine with enough force to direct fully at the Vulture, wrapping around him and the surprise loosening his grip instantly. And then you&rsquo;re falling again. This time into something that felt harsher than any concrete. You couldn&rsquo;t fall into the water. This goddamn suit wasn&rsquo;t made for water. But Tony was smart enough for web wings to be an invention. Their instant loyalty spreads from your sides, catching you in a drift with your body just inches from the body of water beneath you. You catch yourself through the air, drifting across the light wind and circling back round to the fight at hand.</p><p>The Vulture was backing away now, stumbling away from you and Peter before flying away. Neither of you had the insentive to follow. You knew he&rsquo;d eventually return.</p><p>You drop your web wings, falling to the ground in a forward roll before letting your body slump against the warm concrete floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit, (Y/n), are you okay?&rdquo; Peter hurries to your side, his hand catching on your shoulders like he needed some contact to know you were actually there.</p><p>You groan and lift up your arm to tug the hood from your head, dropping your arm back to the floor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pulls his hood off too, running a hand through his untamed locks, &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo;</p><p>You frown at him and push up onto your elbows, &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get you home,&rdquo; He nods, standing up and reaching his arms underneath your shoulders to lift you up.</p><p>It was an odd response. And even more odd was his silence on your entire journey home.</p><p>~~~</p><p>&ldquo;Well? What the fuck happened?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s voice is far too harsh for your ringing ears as you&rsquo;re slumped in a chair without any intention of having this conversation now.</p><p>&ldquo;It was my fault sir. I should&rsquo;ve been more cautious and I wasn&rsquo;t an-&rdquo; Peter rambles, dropping his hands down to his sides, &ldquo;And, like I said, it wasn&rsquo;t her,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that Peter,&rdquo; You break in, shifting in the chair and trying your best to focus on the situation even with the ringing still in your ears, &ldquo;I said I wanted to help,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither of you should be getting involved! I told you to stay out of it!&rdquo; Tony snaps, head flicking between the two of you with an annoyingly fatherly irritation.</p><p>&ldquo;And do what instead? Sit back and let the bad guys take over?&rdquo; You laugh, &ldquo;Yeah because I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the motto you live by, Tony,&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looks away from you in a moment you wanted him to support. </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, come on! We&rsquo;re not just kids! We&rsquo;re spiderpeople or whatever shit name you want to give us,&rdquo; You let out an anger fueled laugh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your decision what we can and cannot do,&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, go home and take that goddamn suit off, I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything like this happening again,&rdquo; Tony waves him off.</p><p>Peter stands there for only a second before walking away. You expect him to at least look at you - nothing.</p><p>You go to stand up too, hoping to find a moment of prolonged peace away from Tony&rsquo;s fury fueled eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you could go,&rdquo; Tony stops you, his stance relaxing despite his harsh tone, &ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tony, we&rsquo;ve been through this,&rdquo; You sigh, pinching the bridge of your nose and sighing.</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; He shakes his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Peter tell me it was him. I want to know why you were even close enough for the Vulture to get to you, hm?&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t respond, &ldquo;There are reasons why I want to keep you away from that, (Y/n) and there are reasons why you should listen,&rdquo;</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>&ldquo;When I found you however many years ago, you were just a girl scared of why she could beat all of the older kids at arm wrestling. And why you suddenly ran faster than them and got these weird moments where you felt like some strange sixth sense was controlling you,&rdquo; He sighs, &ldquo;I promised myself I&rsquo;d protect you and teach you how to cope with those things that scared you. I did that, I really really tried and I did that. I had to learn how to be like a Dad and I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when I got my first period?&rdquo; You laugh, &ldquo;You locked me in your stupid basement thing with all of the suits and you bought out an entire shop of everything that could help. You were terrified!&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckles and looks down at his feet, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have bad hormones!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How bad did you think they&rsquo;d be?!&rdquo; You exclaim and for a moment the two of you have a gentle laughter that settles into a welcome silence.</p><p>&ldquo;I brought you here so you&rsquo;d have someone other than me. So Peter could learn from you and you from him. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to go against me,&rdquo; Tony mumbles and its one of those statements that lets your heart drop faster than you did to that concrete.</p><p>You push yourself to stand up from the chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I am. But I want to help. Just like you do, just like I should do. And Peter is a good guy and we work well together,&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods and clasps his hands in front of him, a typical businessman gesture that he still hadn&rsquo;t lost.</p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll speak to you about it next time, okay?&rdquo; You clasp his shoulder and you&rsquo;re thankful that he can take a little bit of your weight in your weakened state.</p><p>&ldquo;And tell me before you go on a date with Parker, alright?&rdquo; He cocks a brow and you hit him with a gentle force.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now,&rdquo; You say quickly, heading toward your room with intent to get away as quickly as possible.</p><p>~~~</p><p>You&rsquo;re laying on your bed with hope of absorbing as much information on exothermic and endothermic reactions as humanly possible but none of it seems to be working.</p><p>Your hand hovered over your phone beside you and you felt as though part of you was physically pulling toward messaging Peter.</p><p><i>'Are you struggling with this as much as I am?!&rsquo; </i></p><p>You message it with an innocent photo of the spilling papers in front of you.</p><p>Wait. Wait. No response.</p><p>Okay, maybe you were exaggerating the wait.</p><p><i>'We can do it in the morning x&rsquo;</i></p><p>You smile at his asssurance - that would probably mean he&rsquo;d already completed it and he&rsquo;d help you with the answers tomorrow. It is his next message that surprises you.</p><p><i>'Can you come round? I think we need to talk.&rsquo;</i></p><p>~~~</p><p>(I really can&rsquo;t decide if I like this so please, more than ever, let me know your honest thoughts!!)</p><p>Tags: <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0TMhQmFSJcVDo6Tz0pibIg\">@imarypayne</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTYhz8SAix2kAyx3S0sWHVA\">@sunshine112</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m_Fijx22baZx1OrZPZHHJQQ\">@bringmethehorizonandpizza</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEhQ4uSLqpJMdVWi_i75QzA\">@supernatural-girl97</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1YBDcBz6Q08BurkhU_q9rA\">@vibhati123</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mIYTZTvm98ugq3dzvzdIvTA\">@butithasntkilledyouyet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mZOKErMb8y_XqH9PBurRosQ\">@faefictions</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfd423T9ymiK6auxtTnOsXA\">@carisi-sonny</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwdRp42HIty5X-EGSuEahGg\">@trap-house-homiecide</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m7raS9lsMcucctfWG5HpPdg\">@tommydaspidey</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHK3bu1q5iOqXC1y9MhdF0A\">@oneblckcoffee</a> </p></p>",

Also if you tag this as st*rk*r I will rip you in half. </p><p>-</p><p>The match ended.</p><p>\u201cThree warnings red fighter, one warning blue! One minus point red, no minus points blue!\u201d</p><p>Peter, the blue fighter, looked down the whole time, trying to breathe again. He didn\u2019t care if he won or lost, as long as he didn\u2019t tie with Flash. Everything hurt, he was certain his nose was bleeding, possibly broken, and he\u2019d been kicked and punched everywhere, even hit with some illegal techniques, such as leg sweeps. And even with his superhuman endurance, Flash had run him ragged. He didn\u2019t want to have to go toe-to-toe with his bully any longer. </p><p>Peter barely registered Miss Van Dyne grabbing hold of his wrist as the judges stood up. He barely noticed his hand being raised up high. He didn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d won the match until he heard his aunt cheering loudly at him from the bleachers.</p><p>Peter and Flash reluctantly shook hands before going over to the other\u2019s coach. Peter looked up at Flash\u2019s coach, a first degree he\u2019d never met, and weakly shook his hand with a forced smile.</p><p>Tony was just as reluctant to shake Flash\u2019s hand, and when he did so, he gripped the foam glove firmly and leaned in.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you have against that kid, but you better stop pulling that shit,\u201d Tony whispered darkly. \u201cYou\u2019re a blue tab. You should know by now what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t, and if your coach keeps condoning this, you\u2019ll never get anywhere in taekwondo, okay, Cobra Kai?\u201d</p><p>Flash nodded frantically.</p><p>Peter walked back over to Tony, almost immediately collapsing in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour mouthpiece,\u201d Tony said, holding out his hand. Oh, he knew that the mouthpiece had been in Peter\u2019s mouth the whole time, but he didn\u2019t really care at this point. Peter looked like he was dying. </p><p>Peter, in his tired haze, barely processed what Mr. Stark was saying to him. He was just trying to breathe.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Let me have your mouthpiece.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, gently taking the saliva-covered piece of silicone from the green belt\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Peter whispered, his voice high with panic and raspy from the lack of air. \u201cMr. Stark&hellip; I can\u2019t breathe! Oh, god, it hurts! My stomach&hellip; it hurts so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked you in the solar plexus, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Tony said, reaching for Peter\u2019s water bottle. Peter nodded, stepping back and allowing Mr. Stark to give him a drink without Peter having to take his gloves off to grab the bottle. Tony undid the chin strap on Peter\u2019s helmet and removed it, before placing the open water bottle to Peter\u2019s trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tilt it slowly, okay?\u201d Tony said. Peter nodded, opening his mouth a bit more.</p><p>\u201cOkay, drink up,\u201d Tony said. He angled the bottom up slightly and Peter greedily drank the cold water inside, alternating between taking deep, desperate breaths of air and giant gulps of water.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, don\u2019t spill it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDrink as much as you can; you need it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ended up finishing off the whole bottle before he was called up for his medal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get enough to drink,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>The division just included Peter and Flash, so the judges handed out only two medals.</p><p>\u201cIn second place, Flash Thompson!\u201d Miss Van Dyne announced. Rhodey stepped forward and put the silver medal around Flash\u2019s neck before shaking his hand.</p><p>\u201cIn first place, Peter Parker!\u201d</p><p>Peter stepped forward, still trying to catch his breath, and allowed Miss Van Dyne herself to put the gold medal around his neck. She gave him a firm handshake and whispered \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>The two competitors bowed out and shook the judges\u2019 hands. Some of them congratulated both of them, others offered them advice, and everyone told Flash to stop sweeping people\u2019s legs. Peter walked back over to where his gear was. He could feel blood dripping from his nose. Tony and May rushed to his side.</p><p>Tony let Miss Starr take over his spot as a judge for the rest of the morning, as a second degree she could probably do better than him,  and went to help Peter take his gear off while Aunt May got him more water. When she came back, Peter was then hurried over to the EMTs for his nosebleed.</p><p>\u201cI&hellip; I think my nose is broken,\u201d Peter said. Sure enough, it was, the broken part clearly visible. </p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve gotta do is push it back in,\u201d Dr. Strange said. He reached for Peter\u2019s nose, but Peter, already scared of how much it would hurt, leaned back. Tony grabbed Peter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony said, rubbing Peter\u2019s back in circles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over in just a second.\u201d Peter closed his eyes and allowed the red belt black tabs currently wearing scrubs that said EMS on the back of the shirt to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna push it back on three,\u201d Strange said. One&hellip;\u201d</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The doctor immediately pushed Peter\u2019s nose back into place, making him yelp in pain. A wadded-up tissue was then placed under his nostrils, and something sticky was placed over the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re okay,\u201d Strange said. \u201cNo sparring for a while though.\u201d</p><p>Peter and Tony now sat in a corner of the gym with their bags. Tony had elected to keep an eye on him while May picked up lunch for the three of them. Peter was breathing normally, his nosebleed had stopped, and he was drinking plenty more water, but he was still very tense, and, from what Tony could tell, very, very sore. And anxious. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d Peter asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony replied.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been hurt so bad that you felt like crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSome of it was Iron Man stuff, and some of it was taekwondo stuff.\u201d He looked at Peter with concern. He knew what the kid was getting at. </p><p>\u201cMr. Stark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to cry, this is the perfect time to do it,\u201d Tony assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Peter hesitantly scooted over to Tony and leaned against him, letting a few tears fall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

Mr. Stark\u2019s strong arms tightened around him and he clung tighter to him, the memory of the sparring match still painfully fresh in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI was scared too,\u201d Tony admitted. \u201cThat kid was brutal. And that shit he was doing was illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked me in the back, too,\u201d Peter said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the center ref can only see so much,\u201d Tony said. \u201cEarlier I saw Banner get kicked below the belt when I was a corner judge for his division. The center ref didn\u2019t see it, but honestly I don\u2019t think she could have, from where she was standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kid, Flash, he goes to my high school. He hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the asshole who keeps calling you names? I thought he just liked to beat the shit out of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone. Just me.\u201d Peter sniffled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. But it\u2019s okay now. I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re one determined fighter, Peter.\u201d Tony ruffled the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stayed like that until May came back with food. Peter, still shaken up, ate his burger while still leaning against the first degree, occasionally asking questions about what the black belt tournaments were like.</p><p>Tony, of course, answered everything, and, when it was time for him to go up for bracketing, couldn\u2019t bear to tear himself away from the poor kid.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now, okay, kiddo?\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou go home and get some rest. You\u2019ve had a full day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the chance to see you compete? No way!\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cSparring is pretty nasty at my level,\u201d Tony warned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna see me get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hurt, I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d Peter said with a smile. \u201cEven black belts need to cry when they\u2019re done sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p>",

One minus point red, no minus points blue!\u201d</p><p>Peter, the blue fighter, looked down the whole time, trying to breathe again. He didn\u2019t care if he won or lost, as long as he didn\u2019t tie with Flash. Everything hurt, he was certain his nose was bleeding, possibly broken, and he\u2019d been kicked and punched everywhere, even hit with some illegal techniques, such as leg sweeps. And even with his superhuman endurance, Flash had run him ragged. He didn\u2019t want to have to go toe-to-toe with his bully any longer. </p><p>Peter barely registered Miss Van Dyne grabbing hold of his wrist as the judges stood up. He barely noticed his hand being raised up high. He didn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d won the match until he heard his aunt cheering loudly at him from the bleachers.</p><p>Peter and Flash reluctantly shook hands before going over to the other\u2019s coach. Peter looked up at Flash\u2019s coach, a first degree he\u2019d never met, and weakly shook his hand with a forced smile.</p><p>Tony was just as reluctant to shake Flash\u2019s hand, and when he did so, he gripped the foam glove firmly and leaned in.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you have against that kid, but you better stop pulling that shit,\u201d Tony whispered darkly. \u201cYou\u2019re a blue tab. You should know by now what\u2019s legal and what isn\u2019t, and if your coach keeps condoning this, you\u2019ll never get anywhere in taekwondo, okay, Cobra Kai?\u201d</p><p>Flash nodded frantically.</p><p>Peter walked back over to Tony, almost immediately collapsing in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYour mouthpiece,\u201d Tony said, holding out his hand. Oh, he knew that the mouthpiece had been in Peter\u2019s mouth the whole time, but he didn\u2019t really care at this point. Peter looked like he was dying. </p><p>Peter, in his tired haze, barely processed what Mr. Stark was saying to him. He was just trying to breathe.</p><p>\u201cPeter? Let me have your mouthpiece.\u201d</p><p>Tony sighed, gently taking the saliva-covered piece of silicone from the green belt\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Peter whispered, his voice high with panic and raspy from the lack of air. \u201cMr. Stark\u2026 I can\u2019t breathe! Oh, god, it hurts! My stomach\u2026 it hurts so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked you in the solar plexus, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Tony said, reaching for Peter\u2019s water bottle. Peter nodded, stepping back and allowing Mr. Stark to give him a drink without Peter having to take his gloves off to grab the bottle. Tony undid the chin strap on Peter\u2019s helmet and removed it, before placing the open water bottle to Peter\u2019s trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna tilt it slowly, okay?\u201d Tony said. Peter nodded, opening his mouth a bit more.</p><p>\u201cOkay, drink up,\u201d Tony said. He angled the bottom up slightly and Peter greedily drank the cold water inside, alternating between taking deep, desperate breaths of air and giant gulps of water.</p><p>\u201cEasy now, don\u2019t spill it,\u201d Tony said. \u201cDrink as much as you can; you need it.\u201d</p><p>Peter ended up finishing off the whole bottle before he was called up for his medal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get enough to drink,\u201d Tony said. </p><p>The division just included Peter and Flash, so the judges handed out only two medals.</p><p>\u201cIn second place, Flash Thompson!\u201d Miss Van Dyne announced. Rhodey stepped forward and put the silver medal around Flash\u2019s neck before shaking his hand.</p><p>\u201cIn first place, Peter Parker!\u201d</p><p>Peter stepped forward, still trying to catch his breath, and allowed Miss Van Dyne herself to put the gold medal around his neck. She gave him a firm handshake and whispered \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><p>The two competitors bowed out and shook the judges\u2019 hands. Some of them congratulated both of them, others offered them advice, and everyone told Flash to stop sweeping people\u2019s legs. Peter walked back over to where his gear was. He could feel blood dripping from his nose. Tony and May rushed to his side.</p><p>Tony let Miss Starr take over his spot as a judge for the rest of the morning, as a second degree she could probably do better than him,  and went to help Peter take his gear off while Aunt May got him more water. When she came back, Peter was then hurried over to the EMTs for his nosebleed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I think my nose is broken,\u201d Peter said. Sure enough, it was, the broken part clearly visible. </p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve gotta do is push it back in,\u201d Dr. Strange said. He reached for Peter\u2019s nose, but Peter, already scared of how much it would hurt, leaned back. Tony grabbed Peter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony said, rubbing Peter\u2019s back in circles. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over in just a second.\u201d Peter closed his eyes and allowed the red belt black tabs currently wearing scrubs that said EMS on the back of the shirt to get closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna push it back on three,\u201d Strange said. One\u2026\u201d</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The doctor immediately pushed Peter\u2019s nose back into place, making him yelp in pain. A wadded-up tissue was then placed under his nostrils, and something sticky was placed over the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSee?

He hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the asshole who keeps calling you names? I thought he just liked to beat the shit out of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone.

You\u2019re one determined fighter, Peter.\u201d Tony ruffled the boy\u2019s hair.</p><p>They stayed like that until May came back with food. Peter, still shaken up, ate his burger while still leaning against the first degree, occasionally asking questions about what the black belt tournaments were like.</p><p>Tony, of course, answered everything, and, when it was time for him to go up for bracketing, couldn\u2019t bear to tear himself away from the poor kid.</p><p>\u201cI gotta go now, okay, kiddo?\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou go home and get some rest. You\u2019ve had a full day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the chance to see you compete? No way!\u201d Peter said.</p><p>\u201cSparring is pretty nasty at my level,\u201d Tony warned. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d wanna see me get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hurt, I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d Peter said with a smile. \u201cEven black belts need to cry when they\u2019re done sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h1>TKD Prompt 6: Post-sparring catharsis (Irondad/Spiderson)</h1><p>Because sometimes you&rsquo;re just that shooketh after sparring. Also if you tag this as st*rk*r I will rip you in half. </p><p>-</p><p>The match ended.</p><p>&ldquo;Three warnings red fighter, one warning blue! One minus point red, no minus points blue!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter, the blue fighter, looked down the whole time, trying to breathe again. He didn&rsquo;t care if he won or lost, as long as he didn&rsquo;t tie with Flash. Everything hurt, he was certain his nose was bleeding, possibly broken, and he&rsquo;d been kicked and punched everywhere, even hit with some illegal techniques, such as leg sweeps. And even with his superhuman endurance, Flash had run him ragged. He didn&rsquo;t want to have to go toe-to-toe with his bully any longer. </p><p>Peter barely registered Miss Van Dyne grabbing hold of his wrist as the judges stood up. He barely noticed his hand being raised up high. He didn&rsquo;t even realized he&rsquo;d won the match until he heard his aunt cheering loudly at him from the bleachers.</p><p>Peter and Flash reluctantly shook hands before going over to the other&rsquo;s coach. Peter looked up at Flash&rsquo;s coach, a first degree he&rsquo;d never met, and weakly shook his hand with a forced smile.</p><p>Tony was just as reluctant to shake Flash&rsquo;s hand, and when he did so, he gripped the foam glove firmly and leaned in.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t know what you have against that kid, but you better stop pulling that shit,&rdquo; Tony whispered darkly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a blue tab. You should know by now what&rsquo;s legal and what isn&rsquo;t, and if your coach keeps condoning this, you&rsquo;ll never get anywhere in taekwondo, okay, Cobra Kai?&rdquo;</p><p>Flash nodded frantically.</p><p>Peter walked back over to Tony, almost immediately collapsing in his arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your mouthpiece,&rdquo; Tony said, holding out his hand. Oh, he knew that the mouthpiece had been in Peter&rsquo;s mouth the whole time, but he didn&rsquo;t really care at this point. Peter looked like he was dying. </p><p>Peter, in his tired haze, barely processed what Mr. Stark was saying to him. He was just trying to breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter? Let me have your mouthpiece.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony sighed, gently taking the saliva-covered piece of silicone from the green belt&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe,&rdquo; Peter whispered, his voice high with panic and raspy from the lack of air. &ldquo;Mr. Stark&hellip; I can&rsquo;t breathe! Oh, god, it hurts! My stomach&hellip; it hurts so much!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He kicked you in the solar plexus, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Tony said, reaching for Peter&rsquo;s water bottle. Peter nodded, stepping back and allowing Mr. Stark to give him a drink without Peter having to take his gloves off to grab the bottle. Tony undid the chin strap on Peter&rsquo;s helmet and removed it, before placing the open water bottle to Peter&rsquo;s trembling lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tilt it slowly, okay?&rdquo; Tony said. Peter nodded, opening his mouth a bit more.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, drink up,&rdquo; Tony said. He angled the bottom up slightly and Peter greedily drank the cold water inside, alternating between taking deep, desperate breaths of air and giant gulps of water.</p><p>&ldquo;Easy now, don&rsquo;t spill it,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Drink as much as you can; you need it.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter ended up finishing off the whole bottle before he was called up for his medal.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure you get enough to drink,&rdquo; Tony said. </p><p>The division just included Peter and Flash, so the judges handed out only two medals.</p><p>&ldquo;In second place, Flash Thompson!&rdquo; Miss Van Dyne announced. Rhodey stepped forward and put the silver medal around Flash&rsquo;s neck before shaking his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;In first place, Peter Parker!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stepped forward, still trying to catch his breath, and allowed Miss Van Dyne herself to put the gold medal around his neck. She gave him a firm handshake and whispered &ldquo;Good job.&rdquo;</p><p>The two competitors bowed out and shook the judges&rsquo; hands. Some of them congratulated both of them, others offered them advice, and everyone told Flash to stop sweeping people&rsquo;s legs. Peter walked back over to where his gear was. He could feel blood dripping from his nose. Tony and May rushed to his side.</p><p>Tony let Miss Starr take over his spot as a judge for the rest of the morning, as a second degree she could probably do better than him,  and went to help Peter take his gear off while Aunt May got him more water. When she came back, Peter was then hurried over to the EMTs for his nosebleed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I think my nose is broken,&rdquo; Peter said. Sure enough, it was, the broken part clearly visible. </p><p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve gotta do is push it back in,&rdquo; Dr. Strange said. He reached for Peter&rsquo;s nose, but Peter, already scared of how much it would hurt, leaned back. Tony grabbed Peter&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Tony said, rubbing Peter&rsquo;s back in circles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be over in just a second.&rdquo; Peter closed his eyes and allowed the red belt black tabs currently wearing scrubs that said EMS on the back of the shirt to get closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna push it back on three,&rdquo; Strange said. One&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The doctor immediately pushed Peter&rsquo;s nose back into place, making him yelp in pain. A wadded-up tissue was then placed under his nostrils, and something sticky was placed over the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;See? You&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; Strange said. &ldquo;No sparring for a while though.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter and Tony now sat in a corner of the gym with their bags. Tony had elected to keep an eye on him while May picked up lunch for the three of them. Peter was breathing normally, his nosebleed had stopped, and he was drinking plenty more water, but he was still very tense, and, from what Tony could tell, very, very sore. And anxious. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Tony replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you ever been hurt so bad that you felt like crying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I have,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Some of it was Iron Man stuff, and some of it was taekwondo stuff.&rdquo; He looked at Peter with concern. He knew what the kid was getting at. </p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you need to cry, this is the perfect time to do it,&rdquo; Tony assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter hesitantly scooted over to Tony and leaned against him, letting a few tears fall.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Just let it out,&rdquo; Tony said. He wrapped an arm around Peter. </p><p>As if he&rsquo;d officially been given permission, Peter began to bawl like a baby, gripping the first degree&rsquo;s dobak and burying his red, sweaty face in the crook of Mr. Stark&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>&ldquo;I was so scared,&rdquo; Peter whimpered, feeling his mentor pick him up and move him to sit on his lap. Mr. Stark&rsquo;s strong arms tightened around him and he clung tighter to him, the memory of the sparring match still painfully fresh in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I was scared too,&rdquo; Tony admitted. &ldquo;That kid was brutal. And that shit he was doing was illegal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He kicked me in the back, too,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;But they didn&rsquo;t call it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, the center ref can only see so much,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Earlier I saw Banner get kicked below the belt when I was a corner judge for his division. The center ref didn&rsquo;t see it, but honestly I don&rsquo;t think she could have, from where she was standing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That kid, Flash, he goes to my high school.

He was sure his Dad was already waiting outside to pick him up.</p><p>\u201cThe lizard people, Peter. You know the ones who control the world. They are brainwashing you constantly. Kanye West? Illuminati. Taylor Swift? Illuminati. Even Beyonc\u00e9 is one of them. Hell, Starbucks is a controlled business by them.\u201d</p><p>Peter furrowed his brows and hitched his backpack higher on his shoulder. Ned must be going crazy. It was just the excitement of the first day in junior high school, Peter thought.</p><p>\u201cLizard people? You are joking, right?\u201d Peter said, both boys making their way down the corridor to the main entrance.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I was just as wary as you are right now, but listen there is so much proof. I will send you some links once I am home.\u201d The boy told his best friend. \u201cListen, I think your Dad might be a member, too. Anyway, I will see you tomorrow,<i> Petey-Pie</i>!\u201d Ned waved goodbye with a big sly grin on his face.</p><p>It was all his Dad\u2019s fault. He always used embarrassing nicknames, even when Ned was around and Ned being the devious best friend he was, used them to tease him whenever he had the chance. \u00a0</p><p>That night Peter spend hour after hour reading about the Illuminati and watching videos of conspiracy theories concerning Illuminati organizations. Apparently, all important people in the world were members and tried to brainwash society into submission. And oh no, his dad was one of the important people, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>He read different articles about Madonna admitting to the world that she knew all the secrets about Illuminati and according to Uncle Clint, Madonna was a trustworthy source.</p><p>After finding out about their satanistic tendencies and sacrificing human lives, and real aliens as politicians and government officials Peter shut his laptop. Overwhelmed with the wealth of information, Peter didn\u2019t even get the chance to catch any rest that night.\u00a0</p><p>The next morning the boy found his father sipping on a Starbucks\u00a0cup of coffee in the kitchen. With a shriek, Peter sprinted towards his Dad and knocked the cup out of his hands. The dark liquid splattered across the kitchen tiles.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDad we do not support the Illuminati! They\u2019re gonna brainwash you!\u201d the boy exclaimed and wrapped his arms tightly around his father\u2019s waist, burying his head in his chest as he dived into the hug he craved since he started reading about the evil organization.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUm, bambino, what are you talking about?\u201d Tony asked after a moment, visibly confused and a little sad about his spilled morning coffee. Steve was nice enough to buy him a cup on his morning run every day and he couldn\u2019t even enjoy it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe Illuminati, Dad!\u201d Peter mumbled as if that would explain everything. Tony run his finger through his son\u2019s unruly curls and stroked over his back in a comforting manner, letting the topic fall for now.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo get ready for school, Tesoro. I\u2019ll drop you off.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Once in the car, Tony turned on the radio but he didn\u2019t even get the chance to bob his head to the song, because Peter slammed his hand on the touchscreen of the board computer to stop the music.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is part of the Illuminati. We can\u2019t listen to music anymore. They use the music industry to manipulate us!\u201d The boy cried out with a haunted look in his eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, slow down. What are you talking about?\u201d Tony asked his son, a look of bewilderment on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNed told me about the Illuminati and how they control everything and, and, and they sacrifice people and some of them are lizards like the president and the devil is their leader and dad-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPeter, hold on. Lizards? I am sure Ned was just joking around, okay. Listen to me, Cucciolo. The Illuminati is just a crazy conspiracy theory created by some lunatics.

And she walked to the little empty lane behind the park where some homeless people were living in small tents.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; I whispered raising my eyebrows behind my mask. She softly smiled taking out a box from her little backpack she was carrying all this time.<br/>&ldquo;Wait, is it the candy box you won in the fantasy quiz in school? But what you doing with it here?&rdquo; I blasted her with questions, once again.<br/>&ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo; She walked behind the tents where some people were warming their hands in born fire. Sensing our presence the four little children in the group cheerfully ran to us and smiled at Y/n. That&rsquo;s when I understood Y/n was handling the candies to the children.<br/>&ldquo;You do this often?&rdquo; I asked walking her back home.<br/>&ldquo;What?&quot;\u00a0<br/>&quot;Giving those homeless children stuff?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Ah&hellip; No actually. I don&rsquo;t have anything to give often. Like if sometimes I get these things and I can't\u00a0 eat them all by myself then I give it to them. I recently saw those children there , maybe just 2 months ago. They are really friendly&hellip; Especially when you don&rsquo;t have many friends .&rdquo; She concluded as we reached her foster home.<br/>&ldquo;Thanks Spidey&hellip;&rdquo; She said giving me a wave and went inside the house as I swung back to mine.<br/>I laid on my bed\u00a0<i>sleepless</i>\u00a0thinking about\u00a0<i>her</i>.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><br/>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/><i>Time is the most fickle minded thing in the universe,<br/></i><i>It changes every now and then,<br/></i><i>making you feel vulnerable each and every time&hellip;<br/></i>And it totally applies to my life.</p><p><br/>The girl I never thought about ever, till now, is the reason why I couldn&rsquo;t sleep all night. She wasn&rsquo;t even part of my life before sometime and now I can&rsquo;t imagine my life without her. I want to know her more, spend time with her, but&hellip;<br/>What if the person who&rsquo;s coming for the ring, actually reaches us?<br/>What if we lose?<br/>Maybe we die in the process,<br/>but death doesn&rsquo;t feel sad when you think about the opposite scenario.<br/>What if we won?<br/>What if she goes back to her home, leaving me behind?<br/>Can I live without her after what she has done to me, what she made me feel?<br/>Her thoughts, her pure thoughts made me fall for her and now I can&rsquo;t escape these feelings, especially after trying to imagine my life without her&hellip; And I saw only darkness.<br/>&ldquo;Peter, Peter, Peter&rdquo;, faint voices could be heard, I felt my body shaking. Suddenly I could see a bright light filling the darkness, making my eyes squint as I slowly lifted my eyelids to see a faint figure standing in front of me. I blinked multiple times until I could see clearly.<br/>&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; I almost whispered, seeing her standing in front of me.<br/>I looked around, realizing that I was sitting on my desk with my head down. Not sleeping last night made me pass out here on the classroom desk.<br/>&ldquo;Oh god, you weren&rsquo;t waking up, are you okay?&rdquo; She asked worriedly.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah I am fine, I think I just slept&rdquo; I answered as she came and took a seat with me.<br/>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo; She asked as she touched my forehead.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah, I am, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I replied, smiling seeing how concerned she was.<br/>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go, it&rsquo;s lunch, Ned will be joining us there,&rdquo; she said, getting up.\u00a0<br/>I nodded and took a seat in the school canteen, meeting my friend Ned there.<br/>I introduced Y/n and Ned to each other and I guess we all are part of a small friend circle.<br/>&ldquo;I am so happy I&rsquo;m sitting with you both, Liz and her friends made me sick!&rdquo; She said with disgust in her voice.<br/>Then she looked at me.<br/>&ldquo;Shit sorry, I mean I forgot you like her&hellip;I am seriously sorry&hellip;.&rdquo; she anxiously chattered.<br/>I held her anxiously waving hands in mine, making her stop.<br/>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I am not into her anymore,&rdquo; I said, looking deep into her eyes, almost getting lost in them.<br/><i>*cough* *cough*<br/></i>I heard coughing sounds in the background. My dear friend Ned Leeds was fake coughing to break this awkward moment. Listening to that, Y/n shook her hands and pulled away, she looked down a little embarrassed. I didn&rsquo;t want to make her uncomfortable. So, I tried to instantly change the topic.<br/>&ldquo;So..\u00a0 ah&hellip; guys as you know the winter vacation is starting from tomorrow, so there is a small Christmas dinner at my house on the Christmas eve. This year we don&rsquo;t have any relatives visiting so I would be glad if both of you could join me and aunt May..&rdquo;, I invited them with a smile.<br/>&ldquo;I would love to come&rdquo;, Ned said a little excited, but Y/n was still looking down.<br/>&ldquo;Are you coming Y/n?&rdquo; Ned asked her, getting her to gaze up again.<br/>&ldquo;Huh! Where?&rdquo; She said, tugging a loose hair strand behind her ear.<br/>&ldquo;Peter just invited us for Christmas dinner, so will you join?&rdquo; Ned explained to Y/n.<br/>&ldquo;Oh, yeah yeah I will,&rdquo; she said, sounding a little nervous.<br/>And then we all followed our school routine and finally left for our home. I actually didn&rsquo;t start training Y/n as promised, cause maybe&hellip; Maybe I was too nervous to see her, until it was finally the Christmas dinner.</p><p><br/>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br/>Ned and Y/n both arrived almost at the same time, just a couple of minutes here and there. Y/n was wearing a solid, back long sleeve scoop top and a red black plaid skirt with black leggings and a matching muffler around her neck.<br/>Simple, but graceful.<br/>May served us the Christmas feast and talked to all of us. The dinner was delicious. Also, both, Y/n and Ned, were cheerfully taking part in the conversations. After a while, Ned left to join his own family.<br/>I want to tell Y/n how I feel, but this Peter Parker avatar makes me feel nervous. Hiding behind a mask is quite easy for these kinds of situations.<br/>&ldquo;Y/n a-actually, Spider-man wanted to meet you so, he&rsquo;s waiting for you on the roof, you should meet him&rdquo;, I said.<br/>She looked at me with narrow eyes.<br/>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; She asked, raising eyebrows.<br/>&ldquo;Yeah yeah!&rdquo; I said, shaking my head.<br/>&ldquo;Okay, then I&rsquo;ll meet him!&rdquo; She said and walked towards the stairs. I ran into my room, putting on my Spider-man costume and left through my window reaching the roof.<br/>Y/n was already standing there. She turned, hearing my footsteps.<br/>&ldquo;I-I just wanted to tell you something,&rdquo; I said, getting close to her.\u00a0<br/>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me whatever you wanted to tell, but without that mask&rdquo;, she said with a small grin.<br/>&ldquo;What? I ah&hellip; it&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;, I tried to process what she just said.<br/>&ldquo;Believe me, it won&rsquo;t make any difference to me!&rdquo; She said, moving her hands towards my mask. She lightly grabbed the edge of my mask.<br/>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; She spoke, indicating that she wanted to lift that mask.<br/>Her gaze was fixed on me. I couldn&rsquo;t reply anything so I nodded in a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"103\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0134c8f00678b9adf0d6b5a2d047870/tumblr_inline_pocu5ax0vU1wsc5ww_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"103\"/></figure><p><b>(TBC)</b> (I THINK I HAVE A THING OR TWO FOR WALLFLOWERS&hellip; DUH!

So, I tried to instantly change the topic.<br>\u201cSo..\u00a0 ah\u2026 guys as you know the winter vacation is starting from tomorrow, so there is a small Christmas dinner at my house on the Christmas eve. This year we don\u2019t have any relatives visiting so I would be glad if both of you could join me and aunt May..\u201d, I invited them with a smile.<br>\u201cI would love to come\u201d, Ned said a little excited, but Y/n was still looking down.<br>\u201cAre you coming Y/n?\u201d Ned asked her, getting her to gaze up again.<br>\u201cHuh! Where?\u201d She said, tugging a loose hair strand behind her ear.<br>\u201cPeter just invited us for Christmas dinner, so will you join?\u201d Ned explained to Y/n.<br>\u201cOh, yeah yeah I will,\u201d she said, sounding a little nervous.<br>And then we all followed our school routine and finally left for our home. I actually didn\u2019t start training Y/n as promised, cause maybe\u2026 Maybe I was too nervous to see her, until it was finally the Christmas dinner.</p><p><br>\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>Ned and Y/n both arrived almost at the same time, just a couple of minutes here and there. Y/n was wearing a solid, back long sleeve scoop top and a red black plaid skirt with black leggings and a matching muffler around her neck.<br>Simple, but graceful.<br>May served us the Christmas feast and talked to all of us. The dinner was delicious. Also, both, Y/n and Ned, were cheerfully taking part in the conversations. After a while, Ned left to join his own family.<br>I want to tell Y/n how I feel, but this Peter Parker avatar makes me feel nervous. Hiding behind a mask is quite easy for these kinds of situations.<br>\u201cY/n a-actually, Spider-man wanted to meet you so, he\u2019s waiting for you on the roof, you should meet him\u201d, I said.<br>She looked at me with narrow eyes.<br>\u201cIs that so?\u201d She asked, raising eyebrows.<br>\u201cYeah yeah!\u201d I said, shaking my head.<br>\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll meet him!\u201d She said and walked towards the stairs. I ran into my room, putting on my Spider-man costume and left through my window reaching the roof.<br>Y/n was already standing there. She turned, hearing my footsteps.<br>\u201cI-I just wanted to tell you something,\u201d I said, getting close to her.\u00a0<br>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me whatever you wanted to tell, but without that mask\u201d, she said with a small grin.<br>\u201cWhat? I ah\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026\u201d, I tried to process what she just said.<br>\u201cBelieve me, it won\u2019t make any difference to me!\u201d She said, moving her hands towards my mask. She lightly grabbed the edge of my mask.<br>\u201cCan I?\u201d She spoke, indicating that she wanted to lift that mask.<br>Her gaze was fixed on me. I couldn\u2019t reply anything so I nodded in a \u2018yes\u2019.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"103\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d0134c8f00678b9adf0d6b5a2d047870/tumblr_inline_pocu5ax0vU1wsc5ww_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"103\"></figure><p><b>(TBC)</b> (I THINK I HAVE A THING OR TWO FOR WALLFLOWERS\u2026 DUH!

And she walked to the little empty lane behind the park where some homeless people were living in small tents.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; I whispered raising my eyebrows behind my mask. She softly smiled taking out a box from her little backpack she was carrying all this time.<br />&ldquo;Wait, is it the candy box you won in the fantasy quiz in school? But what you doing with it here?&rdquo; I blasted her with questions, once again.<br />&ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo; She walked behind the tents where some people were warming their hands in born fire. Sensing our presence the four little children in the group cheerfully ran to us and smiled at Y/n. That&rsquo;s when I understood Y/n was handling the candies to the children.<br />&ldquo;You do this often?&rdquo; I asked walking her back home.<br />&ldquo;What?\"&nbsp;<br />\"Giving those homeless children stuff?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Ah&hellip; No actually.

They are really friendly&hellip; Especially when you don&rsquo;t have many friends .&rdquo; She concluded as we reached her foster home.<br />&ldquo;Thanks Spidey&hellip;&rdquo; She said giving me a wave and went inside the house as I swung back to mine.<br />I laid on my bed&nbsp;<i>sleepless</i>&nbsp;thinking about&nbsp;<i>her</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><br />&bull;&bull;&bull;<br /><i>Time is the most fickle minded thing in the universe,<br /></i><i>It changes every now and then,<br /></i><i>making you feel vulnerable each and every time&hellip;<br /></i>And it totally applies to my life.</p><p><br />The girl I never thought about ever, till now, is the reason why I couldn&rsquo;t sleep all night. She wasn&rsquo;t even part of my life before sometime and now I can&rsquo;t imagine my life without her. I want to know her more, spend time with her, but&hellip;<br />What if the person who&rsquo;s coming for the ring, actually reaches us?<br />What if we lose?<br />Maybe we die in the process,<br />but death doesn&rsquo;t feel sad when you think about the opposite scenario.<br />What if we won?<br />What if she goes back to her home, leaving me behind?<br />Can I live without her after what she has done to me, what she made me feel?<br />Her thoughts, her pure thoughts made me fall for her and now I can&rsquo;t escape these feelings, especially after trying to imagine my life without her&hellip; And I saw only darkness.<br />&ldquo;Peter, Peter, Peter&rdquo;, faint voices could be heard, I felt my body shaking. Suddenly I could see a bright light filling the darkness, making my eyes squint as I slowly lifted my eyelids to see a faint figure standing in front of me. I blinked multiple times until I could see clearly.<br />&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; I almost whispered, seeing her standing in front of me.<br />I looked around, realizing that I was sitting on my desk with my head down. Not sleeping last night made me pass out here on the classroom desk.<br />&ldquo;Oh god, you weren&rsquo;t waking up, are you okay?&rdquo; She asked worriedly.<br />&ldquo;Yeah I am fine, I think I just slept&rdquo; I answered as she came and took a seat with me.<br />&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo; She asked as she touched my forehead.<br />&ldquo;Yeah, I am, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I replied, smiling seeing how concerned she was.<br />&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go, it&rsquo;s lunch, Ned will be joining us there,&rdquo; she said, getting up.&nbsp;<br />I nodded and took a seat in the school canteen, meeting my friend Ned there.<br />I introduced Y/n and Ned to each other and I guess we all are part of a small friend circle.<br />&ldquo;I am so happy I&rsquo;m sitting with you both, Liz and her friends made me sick!&rdquo; She said with disgust in her voice.<br />Then she looked at me.<br />&ldquo;Shit sorry, I mean I forgot you like her&hellip;I am seriously sorry&hellip;.&rdquo; she anxiously chattered.<br />I held her anxiously waving hands in mine, making her stop.<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I am not into her anymore,&rdquo; I said, looking deep into her eyes, almost getting lost in them.<br /><i>*cough* *cough*<br /></i>I heard coughing sounds in the background.
