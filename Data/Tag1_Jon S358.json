Jon&rsquo;s eyes were trained upon every injury he inspected, gentling his touch as his hands trailed across her tender bruises, her scabbing cuts, and every other injury that marred her pale flesh. Sansa kept her own eyes glued to a spot on the ceiling, breathing slowly, her heart beat quick within her chest. </p><p>Improper as it may have been, Sansa had stripped from her gown and cloak to allow Jon to see the abuse she had suffered. He had not necessarily asked, but intuition told Sansa that he wanted to see for himself what she had been dealt. And part of her wanted him to see- finally, someone to witness her abuse. Finally, someone to see with wide open eyes all that she had been forced through. Unlike those loyal (whether truly loyal or from fear) to Ramsay who had ignored every beating Sansa had suffered, who had blocked their ears to her screams, who had shut their eyes to the bruises when Ramsay had gone too far and lashed out against her face and hands. Now, Jon could catch a glimpse of the horrors she had suffered. Sansa then spared him a single glance and she had to wonder if Jon knew there were tears clinging to his lashes. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s breath caught as he traced the line of a scar on her shoulder and he could not help but to wonder what lay beneath the clothes she still yet wore. And worse than those physical injuries had to be the ones to her heart and soul, the wounds he could never see. Jon could not believe such a fate had happened upon his sister. &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; he muttered gruffly, suddenly pulling back from her and turning away as she silently pulled her gown back on, sickened to his very core. When he turned back to face her a moment later, Jon felt his heart skip a beat, felt a warm rushing through his veins. He hated thinking of her in that monster&rsquo;s arms, falling beneath his raised fists. He hated thinking of her, frightened out of her mind, pushed onto a bed by a man who did not love her, but only wanted to hurt her for his own pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Sansa,&rdquo; he spoke then, his voice breaking as he reached out his hand yet again, this time to gently stroke the petal soft skin of her cheek. Beneath his touch she trembled, tears filling her blue eyes as their gazes met. &ldquo;I should have protected you.&rdquo; The little sister he had told his father he&rsquo;d always watch over&hellip; He&rsquo;d let her down. He&rsquo;d gone off on his own and never thought twice of what was happening to the family he&rsquo;d loved. And so, when their father had died and then Robb after him, Sansa had no one left to protect her. Bastard or not, he was the next eldest brother, it should have been him. It should have been him to take care of her. Jon&rsquo;s eyes closed as he felt shame flood his face, suddenly unable to look his dear sister in her eyes. </p><p>A moment later, her had slid into place over his, small and cold against his, bringing Jon back. His eyes opened and there were hers, so blue that they nearly took his breath away. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame yourself, Jon.&rdquo; Part of her already knew who had caused all of this, though she would keep such thoughts to herself until the moment was right. One thing she had learned in all her time with the Lannister&rsquo;s was never give up information until it best benefited you. She had practically lived in Cersei&rsquo;s shadow those years before going to Ramsay, Sansa knew how to play her part in the game. &ldquo;But please&hellip;&rdquo; She trailed off, his hand sliding down her cheek, though he drew it towards him, hesitant to let her go. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever let me go back there.&rdquo; \u00a0Jon watched as the tears began to swiftly fall, her face crumpling as she began to sob quietly. </p><p>So he did the only thing that made any sense at all.</p><p>He pulled her against his chest, holding tightly to her though she stiffened in his arms, and drew her down towards the floor. She clung to him then, her face buried into his shoulder, her tears soaking his sleeve as she cried every tear she had denied herself. Jon wrapped his arms around her, the warmth of his body returning the heat back to hers, the only sound that of her soft crying and his quiet words of comfort. Nothing in the world would have made him move from her right then, not even the Gods themselves could take him away from Sansa ever again.</p><p>There, with her in his arms, Jon vowed that he would set things right. He would do right by her and ensure the bastard Bolton would pay for what he had done to her. Forever more, no matter the cost to himself, he would protect her. He would give his life to ensure she was safe. Gone were the vows he&rsquo;d made to the Night&rsquo;s Watch, those had died the day he had. No, he had a new vow, a more important one, and that was to protect his sister and take back their home. </p><p>It was all they had left, after all. <br/></p>",
