I\u2019m sure other people said the same thing already but whatever.</p><p>The difference between Jonerys and Jonsa is very simple. Jon and Sansa grew up as siblings, they consider each other brother and sister.

I don\u2019t know how many of you ever watched The Vampire Diaries but, in this TV show, the protagonist, Elena Gilbert, finds out she\u2019s adopted (and then later finds out that her real father is who she thought was her uncle).

Do you think that, when they found out the truth, did they suddenly stop seeing each other as brother and sister (let alone wanting to shag each other)? No!

Because,&nbsp;<i>in their minds,</i>&nbsp;they are still brother and sister and that&rsquo;s <i>never</i>&nbsp;going to change, no matter the actual blood relationship they share.</p><p>Now, unto Jonerys. As we know, Jon and Daenerys met and fell in love completely unaware of the blood relationship they shared. They weren&rsquo;t family (they didn&rsquo;t consider each other family when they met), they were <i>strangers. </i>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that, in reality, they are aunt and nephew because, <i>in their minds</i>, they are simply two people in love with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying that once they find out the truth everything will be fine and dandy but I really believe that in the end it won&rsquo;t matter because they are <i>already</i>&nbsp;in love with each other. If you really love someone, it&rsquo;s not easy to just fall out of love with that someone, no matter the reason. Sure, they could pretend to not love each other anymore but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they will <i>actually </i>stop.</p><p>So, you see, it&rsquo;s all about how they consider each other in their minds and not the actual DNA they share. Sansa is NOT EVEN an OPTION in Jon&rsquo;s mind as a romantic interest because he considers her his sister and like I explained, that won&rsquo;t change once he finds out the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>And please, spare me the whole&nbsp;&lsquo;Jon is already in love with Sansa&rsquo;, my post is to people who are actually capable of accepting CANON reality, not how they want it to be.</p><p>And to add another thing, always in defense of Daenerys, Daenerys could turn into the mad villain antis want and yet, Jon will <i>still NOT FUCK his sister. </i>Therefore all this hate towards her is completely pointless.</p>",

Apologies if you've already talked about this but many people have noticed what seems to be the show's deliberate attempt to frame Jon and Sansa as Ned and Cat 2.0, not so much in terms of their relationship I'd say, but definitely when it comes to similar scenes (being interrupted by Maester Wolkan in 7x01 in the exact spot where Rodrik interrupted N/C in 1x01 as well as overlooking kids practice archery  and the obvious one: Ned and Jon choking LF) and the way they're shot... thoughts?",

If you want to show the implementation of Jon\u2019s co-ed archery lessons and then pan back to Jon and Sansa having a political discussion, then yeah, the resulting shot is going to look somewhat like the establishing Stark family moment back in 1.01. Of course it is. We\u2019ve also seen Sansa and Ramsay conferring on those exterior walkways, and Sansa and Arya, and Sansa and Littlefinger. It takes more than two sets of two people people on the same walkways holding a conversation to make an actual paralleled\u00a0<i>relationship.</i></p><p>The intentional similarities I think are explained by something simpler - the show\u2019s undoubtedly trying to emphasise the character resonance and core similarity between Ned and Jon. They\u2019ve got the costumes, they\u2019ve got the stupidly honourable decisions, and yes, even choking Littlefinger for being a creep.

Even the simple mention of that man had her stomach fluttering all over. The notion of being a couple with him, in fact with anyone in general, miffed her a bit. It\u2019s been way too long since she\u2019d done anything like that. Would there be safe landing if she took the leap? Would he catch her? <br/><br/>\u201cYes, missy.\u201d Missandei pointed the ice cream scoop threateningly at Dany, determination written on her face. Rinsing the scoop under the tap to remove any remaining flavour of a prior ice cream before plunging it into a tub of chocolate swirl. She began to gather the creamy goodness to form a ball about the size of an orange. \u201cI won\u2019t have you stuck in this conundrum any longer.\u201d Gingerly transferring the scoop to a chilled sundae cup, her tone softened into something gentler. \u201cI want to see you happy, Dany. You\u2019ve been alone for so long. You need to put yourself out there and give that man a shot while you still can, love. I can tell he\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure you can too.\u201d<br/><br/>For as long as Dany could remember, men had always fawned over her. As a tween and a teen, she was happy for the attention of those enthusiastic boys. She allowed herself to be swept away by the, in hindsight, very poor flirtatious attempts of those silly high school boys. She was so excited at the thought of maybe finding her first love. Not knowing any better, she caved under the exaggerated displays of affection and flirtatious remarks that a certain popular senior quarter back had bestowed her. They were going to be together forever she thought naively at the time, clinging onto his football jersey sleeve. Unfortunately, it was all just wishful thinking. He never felt that way. They were together for two whole years until it was time for him to leave for college. All he left for her was a voicemail. \u201cYou were fun while it lasted but we both need to grow up.\u201d<br/><br/>With drying tear tracks and a scab marring her young heart, it was as if a veil over her eyes had been lifted. She had to be cautious now to protect herself. <br/>As she grew into a woman she quickly came to realize that what most men only ever cared for was a woman\u2019s physical appearance, her looks and nothing more. They were never interested in her opinions or her interests. They only wanted to show off the fact that they had a beautiful girl on their arm. With time, the pursuit only got worse to the point that she grew sick of them all, so sick of shallow men hitting on her from the get go, so sick of their fragile masculinity and extremely done with feeling like a piece of meat for sale. The piercing glares from the members of her own gender didn\u2019t help either. So, she rejected them, over and over again, man after man, deciding to focus her life being married to her work.\u00a0</p><p>What she never told anyone was that by doing so, she always felt quite lonely. She didn\u2019t date much because she was scared. She was scared that all the men were just the same. They\u2019d use her and kick her to the side. Only Missandei was aware of her fears. <br/><br/>After all, the olive-skinned beauty was her best pal. She was a great listening ear on the other end of the phone. A soothing balm to cheer her up after every frustrated crying session. The very person who made it a point to list every positive characteristic she could think of in attempts to erase any trace of self-doubt or loathing Dany could have. She\u2019d been there for Dany since they met all those years ago, building sandcastles in the sand box behind their elementary school. Missandei was the only person who stuck by her side through everything. <br/><br/>Wringing her hands, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, little butterflies flitted to and fro, stirring up a tremor of anxiety that rippled through her being. Missandei was right. Dany did know. Her intuition, her gut told her that that stranger sitting just outside the door was different. He seemed like the type to stand at the sidelines and hide in the shadows at a gathering, almost like he never wanted to stand out. He wasn\u2019t loud and he didn\u2019t demand her attention. He was quiet, he kept to himself and was almost unseemly. All of that was what made her notice him all the more. He wasn\u2019t like any other man she\u2019d met before.<br/><br/>If she were to be truthful, she was growing tired of being all on her own with the occasional romance novel to fill the void within her heart. She wanted to finally learn what it was like to be truly cared for and loved by a man. She longed to experience what it was like to trust someone with her heart and have them trust her with theirs. \u00a0<br/><br/>Taking a deep fortifying breath, feeling her lungs expand to their full capacity. Perhaps, now was the time to be brave? The butterflies dispersed and flew out her body with a slow exhale of her breath. <br/><br/>\u201cOkay.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cHmm?\u201d Carefully balancing a scoop of coffee ice cream atop of the chocolate swirl, Missandei hummed. <br/><br/><i>Here goes nothing.</i><br/><br/>\u201cWhat was that \u2018in\u2019 that you had in mind?\u201d<br/><br/>Mouth falling open in a muted gasp, Missandei placed her ice cream scoop down a bit too hard with a clang. Calmly sliding the door of the freezer close, she took a step closer before throwing her arms around Dany. She let out a squeal that reverberated around Dany\u2019s skull. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d She squeezed the mildly flabbergasted smaller woman to her tightly, lifting her up off the ground about an inch and swung her in a clumsy circle. Dany\u2019s chuckles came out a bit muffled against Missandei\u2019s neck. <br/><br/>\u201cSandie&hellip;. You\u2019re squishing me.\u201d Giving her friend\u2019s back a light tap, she urged her to put her down. They still had an order to serve. \u201cAnd the ice cream\u2019s going to melt if you leave it there.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh shoot! Let me serve this up first and I\u2019ll tell you what you need to do in a tick.\u201d Tossing a wink at Dany, Missandei snagged two spoons from the drawer by her hip and some napkins from the dispenser on top of the freezer display and bustled off to serve up the two animatedly chatting teenage girls occupying a booth by the bay windows. Swiftly depositing it on the table between the girls, leaving them with a cheerful \u201cenjoy!\u201d, she hurried back to Dany\u2019s side.<br/><br/>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the plan.\u201d Dany watched on curiously as Missandei retrieved a mini cone from its stack. Humming a cheery tune, she took a tiny ball of vanilla bean ice cream and <br/>pressed it onto the cone. \u201cAll right. You, my friend, are going to take this cone to him.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cA baby cone? Did he order another ice cream?\u201d Rising to her tippy toes to glance at the dashing man outside. Just his side profile was present to her, but he really was handsome. One look at him had her feeling so elated. She could stare at him all day. Also, watching his tongue peek out to lick deftly at his mint chocolate chip sent jolts of lust straight down to the centre of her. How she envied those ice cream cones sometimes. <br/><br/>A loud snigger startled her out of her day dream. Throwing a glare at Missandei, whose raven ringlets were swishing about as she shook with laughter, Dany pouted. \u201cWell&hellip;. I was just checking&hellip;.\u201d She huffed. Her cheeks were heating up again. <br/><br/>Eyebrows waggling up and down with a knowing glint in her eye, Missandei asked. Her lips a smirk. \u201cChecking what out hmm?\u201d <br/><br/>Hiding her flushing cheeks behind her hands, Dany sighed. Her friend knew all about her crush but it still made no difference. In fact, it probably made it worse because of the teasing. If the ground opened and swallowed her up, that would be perfect. All of this was so embarrassing. Where did her composure flee to? She was an adult close to thirty!<br/><br/>Still laughing, Missandei pulled a hand away from Dany\u2019s face. Placing the cone in it, she folded her fingers around it. \u201cThis is your key. The opening you need.\u201d<br/><br/>Looking down at the cone, a furrow etched itself between her dark brows. \u201cGive him a baby cone? He already has one.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for Jon. It\u2019s for his puppy!\u201d Missandei beamed at her. She was confident that this would work. Nodding enthusiastically, she turned Dany around and began marching her friend towards the door. <br/><br/>\u201cWhat puppy?\u201d Dany asked confused before back tracking. Her mind replaying what her friend had said. \u201cWait\u2026 Jon?\u201d She exclaimed with a gasp. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she whirled around. The ice cream cone barely missing Missandei\u2019s blouse.<br/><br/>\u201cJon!\u201d She repeated in a low hiss. \u201cIs that&hellip; is that his name? You knew his name and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI only just found out! He told me when I was taking his order just now.\u201d Missandei didn\u2019t even bother resisting her amusement or curb her enjoyment at Dany\u2019s predicament. \u201cHis name is Jon Snow.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cJon&hellip;. Snow&hellip;\u201d The two words that made up a huge part of his identity rolled slowly over her tongue. She finally had a name for her to put to his face. It suited him well. It suited his physique perfectly too for he was beautiful, like fresh snow falling from the ski. <br/><br/>The sight of Dany\u2019s enamoured smile and the dreamy look in her eyes directed at the man munching on his waffle cone just a few feet away, was an image that Missandei had never seen the petite lady wear before. <br/><br/>Rubbing a comforting hand over Dany\u2019s back, Missandei could tell. Her friend was in love. Drawing Dany in for a brief hug, she supplied her long-time bestie with one more push. \u201cYou deserve happiness and I think he might be good for you. Don\u2019t let him slip you by.\u201d Slowly, turning Dany towards the door and possibly a new romance once more, Missandei began guiding her towards it. <br/><br/>Gulping, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, gripped by the hands of nervousness. This was worse than facing down her fear of public speaking as a kid. Heck, the fear was back, tenfold. As they made their way pass the freezer display, she felt like she was going to throw up. The hands clutching tightly at her shoulders were the only things that made her feel just a tad better. The front door of her parlour loomed ahead. <br/><br/>\u201cBut&hellip; Hold up!\u201d Shrugging Missandei\u2019s hands away, she turned to ask a question that she just realized that she should have thought about before agreeing to this. Her eyes were filled with uncertainty and fear. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh boy, trust me girl, he does. So very much! I saw the way he looked at you when you ran away from him to the back earlier.\u201d<br/><br/>Fingers digging into Missandei\u2019s forearm, she squeaked: \u201cHe saw me?\u201d <br/><br/>Nodding fervently, Missandei moved her friend\u2019s talon like fingers away from her flesh and into the cradle of her hands. Holding her small clammy hand in hers, she informed Dany of what she had seen, without a scratch of doubt: \u201cThe man is crazy about you! He was so sad when you weren\u2019t the one taking his order. He was practically following you with his desolate eyes when you fled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d Dany was astounded. This was news to her! Her crush had a crush on her too? \u201cBut, that sounds too good to be tr&hellip;?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cTrust me! He likes you Dany! Just start with \u2018hello\u2019. You got this.\u201d Throwing on her fiercest scowl, with a fist waving at Jon\u2019s back, Missandei gave Dany her word. \u201cIf the worst happens and he hurts you, I\u2019ll kick his ass! That black belt in karate of mine will finally be put to good use.\u201d <br/><br/>With a shaky laugh, her nerves settled a little bit. Grasping the cone more firmly in her hand, Dany reached out with her other for the door handle. Yanking the heavy wooden door open a crack, the cool spring breeze and the smell of clean, crisp air from the outside drifted over her. Eyes darting to the left, her heart nearly jumped into her mouth. Jon was right there! <br/><br/>Oh my god! I\u2019m actually doing this! Dany\u2019s mind yelled out as her heart did summersaults within her chest. Taking a small step towards Jon, she winced as the boards creaked under her weight. <br/><br/>Sensing someone behind him, his hand paused in mid composition. The crotchet he was sketching on a page of his five lined manuscript had yet to have a tail. Turning to see who it was creeping up on him, his pencil fell from his grip and his mouth fell agape in shock. Daenerys was staring right back at him. <br/><br/>Time seemed to came to a standstill as wide brown eyes and violet ones met, like two deer caught in the headlights of a car.<br/><br/>Oh. My. God.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s her! (It\u2019s him!)<br/><br/>Their inner selves were screaming. <br/><br/>\u201cHi!\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cHello!\u201d <br/><br/>They yelled out at the same time. A long moment of silence shrouded them both. Gosh this was awkward. It would seem that neither of them knew how to function properly at the sight of one another up close. Their cheeks were getting redder by the second. Chuckling nervously, Jon ran a hand through his unruly curls while Dany giggled, head ducking down to look at the now melting cone. The cream was starting to dribble down the sides into the napkin tucked around it. <br/><br/>\u201cUmm&hellip; let\u2019s start over. My name is Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Her voice came out small. Clearing her throat and taking a shallow breath, she forced some confidence back into her veins and looked straight at the gorgeous man before her. \u201cBut you can call me Dany.\u201d <br/><br/>She presented him with the most stunning smile he had the pleasure to see. That same one he saw so many times now, but finally directed in his direction. It was blinding up close. He was captivated. And her voice! It sounded so smooth and velvety, like the creamiest, sweetest, warmest, fudgiest chocolate syrup. And her eyes! He could easily drown in those purple irises. They reminded him of summers running through fields of lavender blossoms that swayed in the breeze. She was absolutely perfect. <br/><br/>\u201cH&hellip;hello?\u201d Dany waved a hand in front of his eyes. <br/><br/>Blinking out of his daze, he realized he\u2019d been staring at her for quite some time. Embarrassed, he looked away, rubbing his palms against his thighs, feeling the friction of his jeans under his skin.\u201cSorry&hellip; it\u2019s just you\u2019re even more breath taking up close. The most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d He muttered, eyes a bit glazed over. Realising how creepy his must have sounded, he immediately apologized again with a grimace pinching at his features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too forward of me! I&hellip;\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNo! It\u2019s okay. Umm&hellip; thank you.\u201d Overcome by an unfamiliar sense of demureness, Dany\u2019s smile was a tiny, shy one. A wave of heat graced her cheeks. Oddly enough, a compliment from this man didn\u2019t make her skin crawl or her ire rise. Instead, it made her heart pound even faster and strangely light.<br/><br/>Motioning to the empty space beside him on the bench, Dany queried:\u201cMind if I joined you?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cYou can join with me anytime. I mean&hellip;. no&hellip; I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Cringing hard, Jon groaned, his body tensed up waiting for her reaction. Would she be repulsed at him and flee? He didn\u2019t mean for that line to come out like that. His mouth just ran away from him.</p><p>To his utter pleasant surprise, Dany was still standing before him. With lips pressed together firmly, she fought hard not to laugh. She was actually tickled at his slip up. This man was adorably cute. Seeing the embarrassed grin taking its place on Jon\u2019s lips, the giggle she was trying to supress broke free. Silly sniggers consumed the two of them until they faded, leaving them just staring at each other for long moments. <br/><br/>\u201cUmm yeah here, let me just&hellip;\u201d Shaking himself out of his mystified state, Jon turned his attention to his belongings.<br/><br/>\u201cThanks so much.\u201d Dany gasped. Another nervous giggle trailed behind her words as she moved closer to the table. <br/><br/>When a startled yelp came from his puppy he realized in his hurry to clear space for Dany, he had accidentally shoved his manuscript book into a snoozing Ghost\u2019s paw. He was awake now and upset. His little whines intermingled with sleepy whimpers and growls.Hurriedly, Jon picked up the puppy and cuddled him close. \u201cOh crap. I\u2019m so sorry, boy!\u201d Tenderly stroking his little paw to soothe the pain. Ghost\u2019s pitiful whines gutted him. His poor puppy! <br/><br/>Gingerly perching herself on the bench beside them, Dany\u2019s heart melted at the sight. He really did have a puppy with him today. The baby husky pup was the sweetest little thing. He held up his little bruised paw to Jon, requesting him to kiss it well. Dany smiled as Jon did just that. He embraced the little white pup, his fingers stroking through the strands of soft, snow white fur, kissing his furry face again and again. Gradually, Ghost\u2019s tail began to wag cheerfully and the puppy started returning his father\u2019s kisses with his own. Her heart was a puddle inside her chest cavity. She thinks that she might be in love. With the man or his dog, she wasn\u2019t too sure yet. <br/><br/>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Jon said in her direction. \u201cThis is so embarrassing. I\u2019m usually not this clumsy. Poor Ghost.\u201d He buried his red face in his dog\u2019s fur. He couldn\u2019t believe Dany had to witness him like this. <br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s really all right, Jon. Well, not alright for your puppy because he got hurt but\u2026\u201d Ramblings. Where did that come from, she wondered to herself.<br/><br/>Hearing his name, Jon peeked up at her. \u201cForgive me for cutting you off. But umm\u2026 How did you know my name?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOh. Missandei told me.\u201d Dany informed him with a smile. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep it off of her face with him around. \u201cShe also gave me this.\u201d Lifting up the rapidly melting cone, Dany showed it to him. \u201cFor the little guy.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cShe mentioned about a treat but you guys really shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Shifting Ghost to sit on his lap with a hand around his belly to keep the pup from slipping away, Jon reached out to take the cone from Dany.</p><p>Their fingers touched just for a second and it was like lightning. They both felt it. That jolt of electricity passing from their fingers lighting up every nerve ending in their bodies. With a sharp intake of breath, they both jumped apart, retracting their hands away from each other. Dany sat ramrod straight with her tingly fingers of her right hand interlaced together with her left on her lap while Jon coughed.<br/><br/>\u201cWell, let us see if Ghost likes ice cream, shall we?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019ve seen little children try ice cream for the first time. A puppy has to be a first for me!\u201d Reaching for his little paw, she gave it a shake. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll make him feel better too.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cCome on, back on the table you go.\u201d Gently placing the white puppy back on the picnic table, Jon presented the cone to him. <br/><br/>Dany watched in awe as Ghost\u2019s little black snout sniffed, sniffed, sniffed at the ball of melting vanilla ice. His little pink tongue poked out to give it a tentative taste. With a delighted bark, he plunged his whole body into the treat, eagerly slobbering up the dripping white delight. His little wisp of a tail flicking happily behind him all the while. <br/><br/>Laughing, Jon turned to Dany and said: \u201cI guess he likes it.\u201d His hands holding the cone were shaking slightly due to the rough impact of Ghost\u2019s hungry licks. <br/><br/>\u201cYeah! He loves it, Jon.\u201d As their eyes met briefly, Dany tried hard not to swoon. Up close, Jon\u2019s deep brown eyes seemed to gleam like a pool of melted chocolate. She wanted to swim within them and never come up for air. This man was so attractive. <br/><br/>Ghost had a paw resting against Jon\u2019s fingers as he gnawed at the rapidly diminishing cone. His teeth producing resounding crunching sounds as he chomped. Soon, the cone was obliterated, leaving behind the remains of melted sticky ice cream and bits of waffle cone crumbs on Jon\u2019s fingers and all down the middle of his hands. Ghost\u2019s relentless tongue lapped at his palm, leaving no trace of his new-found love behind. <br/><br/>Dany\u2019s laughter rang out loud and bright, watching Ghost\u2019s adorable antics and Jon\u2019s heart soared. There it was! That melodious laughter of hers. His eyes watched mesmerized as a bright lovely smile formed on her lips. Her violet eyes were twinkling with mirth.<br/><br/>Rummaging through her apron pocket, Dany fished out a few pieces of napkins for Jon to clean his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d She offered them to him. <br/><br/>\u201cThank you.\u201d Taking the napkins from her, Jon meticulously cleaned his fingers before wiping away the ring of cream around his puppy\u2019s mouth and the droplets stuck in his whiskers. Ghost whined in dismay at the loss of his treat. <br/><br/>\u201cAww. Don\u2019t worry, little one. They\u2019ll be plenty of ice cream for you next time.\u201d Scratching the little patch of skin under his chin, Dany cooed at the puppy. Yipping happily, the pitter patter of his little feet brought him to the edge of the table. Leaping across the space, he jumped straight into the welcoming arms of his new favourite person. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Catching an armful of white fluff, Dany exclaimed. With a giggle, she lifted the dog into the air so that they were face to face. \u201cHello there.\u201d In greeting, the puppy licked a streak across her nose, pulling a laugh from her as her nose scrunched up at the tickly sensation. \u00a0<br/><br/>Meeting Dany\u2019s smiling eyes, a smitten grin plastered itself upon Jon\u2019s face. He was in love. Seeing the girl of his dreams cuddling his baby, he couldn\u2019t really tell if it was the sight of the two of them together or the woman in front of him that he was in love with. Maybe both. <br/><br/>Just then, a hoard of school children came thundering up the steps and went charging into the house looking for an after-school treat, breaking the comfortable spell they were under. It would seem like their time was up for now. Dany\u2019s heart sank as her lips turned down into a frown. \u201cI\u2019d better head back in. Missandei probably needs an extra hand.\u201d She muttered, regrettably handing Ghost back to Jon. She dreaded to leave him so soon. They barely got to talking. She liked spending time with him. With a lingering look at Jon over her shoulder, she began her retreat back into her house. <br/><br/>\u201cOh okay&hellip;.\u201d He longed to reach out and grab her hand to make her stay just a bit longer. To keep seeing her smile. He was just getting to know her. Unless&hellip;. \u201cDany!\u201d<br/><br/>Jon\u2019s near yell of her name startled her right out of her skin. Spinning around with her hands clasped in front of her belly, Dany met to nervous features of the charming man who she already found herself coming to adore. \u201cYes?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWould you&hellip;\u201d Fingers clenching and unclenching against the grainy wood of his bench, Jon struggled to find his bravery. This was all that he\u2019d ever wanted since clapping eyes on her. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. \u201cWould you&hellip; like to go out with me some day?\u201d <br/><br/>For moments she stood there, mouth slowly falling open. Blinking owlishly down at Jon, Dany\u2019s mind took a beat to process his request before kicking start again, along with the feeling of pure glee. The smile lit up her whole being. He was asking her out! \u201cYes!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cReally?\u201d Jon asked, taken aback. Were his ears deceiving him? All he had to do was ask? It was that simple? <br/><br/>\u201cYes, Jon. I\u2019d like that! Very much.\u201d Teeth finding her bottom lip, she bit down hard. The slight sting of pain told her that this was real. <br/><br/>\u201cOh.\u201d Now it was his turn to gawp. \u201cWell&hellip;. Okay. Cool! Umm&hellip; I\u2019ll come by and get you.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cWhen?\u201d Dany queried breathlessly. Her heart galloped a tattoo so hard she thought it would explode out of the confines of her cage of ribs. She felt as if she could just float away. <br/><br/>\u201cHow about, this weekend. Sunday?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cSure. That sounds lovely.\u201d A giddy giggle stole pass her drawn up lips. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cMe too.\u201d A matching grin transformed his lips into a beaming smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again real soon, Dany.\u201d <br/><br/>With a little nod, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, Dany pushed her front door open. Turning back, she gave Jon a bashful wave before heading back inside, feeling suddenly invigorated. <br/><br/>Waving back at her with a goofy smile, he watched wistfully as she disappeared through the throng of kids. If he weren\u2019t in public, Jon would have jumped up and did a happy victory jig. Instead, he resorted to sweeping his puppy up in a big hug and rocking him. It was all thanks to Ghost that his first meeting with Dany went so well. Oh, he should probably call his friend up too and give him his thanks for his sagely advice. But that can wait till later. Now, he had a date to plan. <br/><br/>The work day passed by in a breeze. And if Missandei noticed the spring in her friend\u2019s step and the constant smile pushing at her cheeks, she sure didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019d get the news out of Dany later. It would seem her best girl was well on her way to a new beginning. </p>",

Even the simple mention of that man had her stomach fluttering all over. The notion of being a couple with him, in fact with anyone in general, miffed her a bit. It\u2019s been way too long since she\u2019d done anything like that. Would there be safe landing if she took the leap? Would he catch her? <br><br>\u201cYes, missy.\u201d Missandei pointed the ice cream scoop threateningly at Dany, determination written on her face. Rinsing the scoop under the tap to remove any remaining flavour of a prior ice cream before plunging it into a tub of chocolate swirl. She began to gather the creamy goodness to form a ball about the size of an orange. \u201cI won\u2019t have you stuck in this conundrum any longer.\u201d Gingerly transferring the scoop to a chilled sundae cup, her tone softened into something gentler. \u201cI want to see you happy, Dany. You\u2019ve been alone for so long. You need to put yourself out there and give that man a shot while you still can, love. I can tell he\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure you can too.\u201d<br><br>For as long as Dany could remember, men had always fawned over her. As a tween and a teen, she was happy for the attention of those enthusiastic boys. She allowed herself to be swept away by the, in hindsight, very poor flirtatious attempts of those silly high school boys. She was so excited at the thought of maybe finding her first love. Not knowing any better, she caved under the exaggerated displays of affection and flirtatious remarks that a certain popular senior quarter back had bestowed her. They were going to be together forever she thought naively at the time, clinging onto his football jersey sleeve. Unfortunately, it was all just wishful thinking. He never felt that way. They were together for two whole years until it was time for him to leave for college. All he left for her was a voicemail. \u201cYou were fun while it lasted but we both need to grow up.\u201d<br><br>With drying tear tracks and a scab marring her young heart, it was as if a veil over her eyes had been lifted. She had to be cautious now to protect herself. <br>As she grew into a woman she quickly came to realize that what most men only ever cared for was a woman\u2019s physical appearance, her looks and nothing more. They were never interested in her opinions or her interests. They only wanted to show off the fact that they had a beautiful girl on their arm. With time, the pursuit only got worse to the point that she grew sick of them all, so sick of shallow men hitting on her from the get go, so sick of their fragile masculinity and extremely done with feeling like a piece of meat for sale. The piercing glares from the members of her own gender didn\u2019t help either. So, she rejected them, over and over again, man after man, deciding to focus her life being married to her work.\u00a0</p><p>What she never told anyone was that by doing so, she always felt quite lonely. She didn\u2019t date much because she was scared. She was scared that all the men were just the same. They\u2019d use her and kick her to the side. Only Missandei was aware of her fears. <br><br>After all, the olive-skinned beauty was her best pal. She was a great listening ear on the other end of the phone. A soothing balm to cheer her up after every frustrated crying session. The very person who made it a point to list every positive characteristic she could think of in attempts to erase any trace of self-doubt or loathing Dany could have. She\u2019d been there for Dany since they met all those years ago, building sandcastles in the sand box behind their elementary school. Missandei was the only person who stuck by her side through everything. <br><br>Wringing her hands, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, little butterflies flitted to and fro, stirring up a tremor of anxiety that rippled through her being. Missandei was right. Dany did know. Her intuition, her gut told her that that stranger sitting just outside the door was different. He seemed like the type to stand at the sidelines and hide in the shadows at a gathering, almost like he never wanted to stand out. He wasn\u2019t loud and he didn\u2019t demand her attention. He was quiet, he kept to himself and was almost unseemly. All of that was what made her notice him all the more. He wasn\u2019t like any other man she\u2019d met before.<br><br>If she were to be truthful, she was growing tired of being all on her own with the occasional romance novel to fill the void within her heart. She wanted to finally learn what it was like to be truly cared for and loved by a man. She longed to experience what it was like to trust someone with her heart and have them trust her with theirs. \u00a0<br><br>Taking a deep fortifying breath, feeling her lungs expand to their full capacity. Perhaps, now was the time to be brave? The butterflies dispersed and flew out her body with a slow exhale of her breath. <br><br>\u201cOkay.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHmm?\u201d Carefully balancing a scoop of coffee ice cream atop of the chocolate swirl, Missandei hummed. <br><br><i>Here goes nothing.</i><br><br>\u201cWhat was that \u2018in\u2019 that you had in mind?\u201d<br><br>Mouth falling open in a muted gasp, Missandei placed her ice cream scoop down a bit too hard with a clang. Calmly sliding the door of the freezer close, she took a step closer before throwing her arms around Dany. She let out a squeal that reverberated around Dany\u2019s skull. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d She squeezed the mildly flabbergasted smaller woman to her tightly, lifting her up off the ground about an inch and swung her in a clumsy circle. Dany\u2019s chuckles came out a bit muffled against Missandei\u2019s neck. <br><br>\u201cSandie\u2026. You\u2019re squishing me.\u201d Giving her friend\u2019s back a light tap, she urged her to put her down. They still had an order to serve. \u201cAnd the ice cream\u2019s going to melt if you leave it there.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh shoot! Let me serve this up first and I\u2019ll tell you what you need to do in a tick.\u201d Tossing a wink at Dany, Missandei snagged two spoons from the drawer by her hip and some napkins from the dispenser on top of the freezer display and bustled off to serve up the two animatedly chatting teenage girls occupying a booth by the bay windows. Swiftly depositing it on the table between the girls, leaving them with a cheerful \u201cenjoy!\u201d, she hurried back to Dany\u2019s side.<br><br>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the plan.\u201d Dany watched on curiously as Missandei retrieved a mini cone from its stack. Humming a cheery tune, she took a tiny ball of vanilla bean ice cream and <br>pressed it onto the cone. \u201cAll right. You, my friend, are going to take this cone to him.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA baby cone? Did he order another ice cream?\u201d Rising to her tippy toes to glance at the dashing man outside. Just his side profile was present to her, but he really was handsome. One look at him had her feeling so elated. She could stare at him all day. Also, watching his tongue peek out to lick deftly at his mint chocolate chip sent jolts of lust straight down to the centre of her. How she envied those ice cream cones sometimes. <br><br>A loud snigger startled her out of her day dream. Throwing a glare at Missandei, whose raven ringlets were swishing about as she shook with laughter, Dany pouted. \u201cWell\u2026. I was just checking\u2026.\u201d She huffed. Her cheeks were heating up again. <br><br>Eyebrows waggling up and down with a knowing glint in her eye, Missandei asked. Her lips a smirk. \u201cChecking what out hmm?\u201d <br><br>Hiding her flushing cheeks behind her hands, Dany sighed. Her friend knew all about her crush but it still made no difference. In fact, it probably made it worse because of the teasing. If the ground opened and swallowed her up, that would be perfect. All of this was so embarrassing. Where did her composure flee to? She was an adult close to thirty!<br><br>Still laughing, Missandei pulled a hand away from Dany\u2019s face. Placing the cone in it, she folded her fingers around it. \u201cThis is your key. The opening you need.\u201d<br><br>Looking down at the cone, a furrow etched itself between her dark brows. \u201cGive him a baby cone? He already has one.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for Jon. It\u2019s for his puppy!\u201d Missandei beamed at her. She was confident that this would work. Nodding enthusiastically, she turned Dany around and began marching her friend towards the door. <br><br>\u201cWhat puppy?\u201d Dany asked confused before back tracking. Her mind replaying what her friend had said. \u201cWait\u2026 Jon?\u201d She exclaimed with a gasp. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she whirled around. The ice cream cone barely missing Missandei\u2019s blouse.<br><br>\u201cJon!\u201d She repeated in a low hiss. \u201cIs that\u2026 is that his name? You knew his name and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI only just found out! He told me when I was taking his order just now.\u201d Missandei didn\u2019t even bother resisting her amusement or curb her enjoyment at Dany\u2019s predicament. \u201cHis name is Jon Snow.\u201d<br><br>\u201cJon\u2026. Snow\u2026\u201d The two words that made up a huge part of his identity rolled slowly over her tongue. She finally had a name for her to put to his face. It suited him well. It suited his physique perfectly too for he was beautiful, like fresh snow falling from the ski. <br><br>The sight of Dany\u2019s enamoured smile and the dreamy look in her eyes directed at the man munching on his waffle cone just a few feet away, was an image that Missandei had never seen the petite lady wear before. <br><br>Rubbing a comforting hand over Dany\u2019s back, Missandei could tell. Her friend was in love. Drawing Dany in for a brief hug, she supplied her long-time bestie with one more push. \u201cYou deserve happiness and I think he might be good for you. Don\u2019t let him slip you by.\u201d Slowly, turning Dany towards the door and possibly a new romance once more, Missandei began guiding her towards it. <br><br>Gulping, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, gripped by the hands of nervousness. This was worse than facing down her fear of public speaking as a kid. Heck, the fear was back, tenfold. As they made their way pass the freezer display, she felt like she was going to throw up. The hands clutching tightly at her shoulders were the only things that made her feel just a tad better. The front door of her parlour loomed ahead. <br><br>\u201cBut\u2026 Hold up!\u201d Shrugging Missandei\u2019s hands away, she turned to ask a question that she just realized that she should have thought about before agreeing to this. Her eyes were filled with uncertainty and fear. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh boy, trust me girl, he does. So very much! I saw the way he looked at you when you ran away from him to the back earlier.\u201d<br><br>Fingers digging into Missandei\u2019s forearm, she squeaked: \u201cHe saw me?\u201d <br><br>Nodding fervently, Missandei moved her friend\u2019s talon like fingers away from her flesh and into the cradle of her hands. Holding her small clammy hand in hers, she informed Dany of what she had seen, without a scratch of doubt: \u201cThe man is crazy about you! He was so sad when you weren\u2019t the one taking his order. He was practically following you with his desolate eyes when you fled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d Dany was astounded. This was news to her! Her crush had a crush on her too? \u201cBut, that sounds too good to be tr\u2026?\u201d <br><br>\u201cTrust me! He likes you Dany! Just start with \u2018hello\u2019. You got this.\u201d Throwing on her fiercest scowl, with a fist waving at Jon\u2019s back, Missandei gave Dany her word. \u201cIf the worst happens and he hurts you, I\u2019ll kick his ass! That black belt in karate of mine will finally be put to good use.\u201d <br><br>With a shaky laugh, her nerves settled a little bit. Grasping the cone more firmly in her hand, Dany reached out with her other for the door handle. Yanking the heavy wooden door open a crack, the cool spring breeze and the smell of clean, crisp air from the outside drifted over her. Eyes darting to the left, her heart nearly jumped into her mouth. Jon was right there! <br><br>Oh my god! I\u2019m actually doing this! Dany\u2019s mind yelled out as her heart did summersaults within her chest. Taking a small step towards Jon, she winced as the boards creaked under her weight. <br><br>Sensing someone behind him, his hand paused in mid composition. The crotchet he was sketching on a page of his five lined manuscript had yet to have a tail. Turning to see who it was creeping up on him, his pencil fell from his grip and his mouth fell agape in shock. Daenerys was staring right back at him. <br><br>Time seemed to came to a standstill as wide brown eyes and violet ones met, like two deer caught in the headlights of a car.<br><br>Oh. My. God.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s her! (It\u2019s him!)<br><br>Their inner selves were screaming. <br><br>\u201cHi!\u201d <br><br>\u201cHello!\u201d <br><br>They yelled out at the same time. A long moment of silence shrouded them both. Gosh this was awkward. It would seem that neither of them knew how to function properly at the sight of one another up close. Their cheeks were getting redder by the second. Chuckling nervously, Jon ran a hand through his unruly curls while Dany giggled, head ducking down to look at the now melting cone. The cream was starting to dribble down the sides into the napkin tucked around it. <br><br>\u201cUmm\u2026 let\u2019s start over. My name is Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Her voice came out small. Clearing her throat and taking a shallow breath, she forced some confidence back into her veins and looked straight at the gorgeous man before her. \u201cBut you can call me Dany.\u201d <br><br>She presented him with the most stunning smile he had the pleasure to see. That same one he saw so many times now, but finally directed in his direction. It was blinding up close. He was captivated. And her voice! It sounded so smooth and velvety, like the creamiest, sweetest, warmest, fudgiest chocolate syrup. And her eyes! He could easily drown in those purple irises. They reminded him of summers running through fields of lavender blossoms that swayed in the breeze. She was absolutely perfect. <br><br>\u201cH\u2026hello?\u201d Dany waved a hand in front of his eyes. <br><br>Blinking out of his daze, he realized he\u2019d been staring at her for quite some time. Embarrassed, he looked away, rubbing his palms against his thighs, feeling the friction of his jeans under his skin.\u201cSorry\u2026 it\u2019s just you\u2019re even more breath taking up close. The most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d He muttered, eyes a bit glazed over. Realising how creepy his must have sounded, he immediately apologized again with a grimace pinching at his features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too forward of me! I\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo! It\u2019s okay. Umm\u2026 thank you.\u201d Overcome by an unfamiliar sense of demureness, Dany\u2019s smile was a tiny, shy one. A wave of heat graced her cheeks. Oddly enough, a compliment from this man didn\u2019t make her skin crawl or her ire rise. Instead, it made her heart pound even faster and strangely light.<br><br>Motioning to the empty space beside him on the bench, Dany queried:\u201cMind if I joined you?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou can join with me anytime. I mean\u2026. no\u2026 I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Cringing hard, Jon groaned, his body tensed up waiting for her reaction. Would she be repulsed at him and flee? He didn\u2019t mean for that line to come out like that. His mouth just ran away from him.</p><p>To his utter pleasant surprise, Dany was still standing before him. With lips pressed together firmly, she fought hard not to laugh. She was actually tickled at his slip up. This man was adorably cute. Seeing the embarrassed grin taking its place on Jon\u2019s lips, the giggle she was trying to supress broke free. Silly sniggers consumed the two of them until they faded, leaving them just staring at each other for long moments. <br><br>\u201cUmm yeah here, let me just\u2026\u201d Shaking himself out of his mystified state, Jon turned his attention to his belongings.<br><br>\u201cThanks so much.\u201d Dany gasped. Another nervous giggle trailed behind her words as she moved closer to the table. <br><br>When a startled yelp came from his puppy he realized in his hurry to clear space for Dany, he had accidentally shoved his manuscript book into a snoozing Ghost\u2019s paw. He was awake now and upset. His little whines intermingled with sleepy whimpers and growls.Hurriedly, Jon picked up the puppy and cuddled him close. \u201cOh crap. I\u2019m so sorry, boy!\u201d Tenderly stroking his little paw to soothe the pain. Ghost\u2019s pitiful whines gutted him. His poor puppy! <br><br>Gingerly perching herself on the bench beside them, Dany\u2019s heart melted at the sight. He really did have a puppy with him today. The baby husky pup was the sweetest little thing. He held up his little bruised paw to Jon, requesting him to kiss it well. Dany smiled as Jon did just that. He embraced the little white pup, his fingers stroking through the strands of soft, snow white fur, kissing his furry face again and again. Gradually, Ghost\u2019s tail began to wag cheerfully and the puppy started returning his father\u2019s kisses with his own. Her heart was a puddle inside her chest cavity. She thinks that she might be in love. With the man or his dog, she wasn\u2019t too sure yet. <br><br>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Jon said in her direction. \u201cThis is so embarrassing. I\u2019m usually not this clumsy. Poor Ghost.\u201d He buried his red face in his dog\u2019s fur. He couldn\u2019t believe Dany had to witness him like this. <br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s really all right, Jon. Well, not alright for your puppy because he got hurt but\u2026\u201d Ramblings. Where did that come from, she wondered to herself.<br><br>Hearing his name, Jon peeked up at her. \u201cForgive me for cutting you off. But umm\u2026 How did you know my name?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh. Missandei told me.\u201d Dany informed him with a smile. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep it off of her face with him around. \u201cShe also gave me this.\u201d Lifting up the rapidly melting cone, Dany showed it to him. \u201cFor the little guy.\u201d<br><br>\u201cShe mentioned about a treat but you guys really shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Shifting Ghost to sit on his lap with a hand around his belly to keep the pup from slipping away, Jon reached out to take the cone from Dany.</p><p>Their fingers touched just for a second and it was like lightning. They both felt it. That jolt of electricity passing from their fingers lighting up every nerve ending in their bodies. With a sharp intake of breath, they both jumped apart, retracting their hands away from each other. Dany sat ramrod straight with her tingly fingers of her right hand interlaced together with her left on her lap while Jon coughed.<br><br>\u201cWell, let us see if Ghost likes ice cream, shall we?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve seen little children try ice cream for the first time. A puppy has to be a first for me!\u201d Reaching for his little paw, she gave it a shake. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll make him feel better too.\u201d <br><br>\u201cCome on, back on the table you go.\u201d Gently placing the white puppy back on the picnic table, Jon presented the cone to him. <br><br>Dany watched in awe as Ghost\u2019s little black snout sniffed, sniffed, sniffed at the ball of melting vanilla ice. His little pink tongue poked out to give it a tentative taste. With a delighted bark, he plunged his whole body into the treat, eagerly slobbering up the dripping white delight. His little wisp of a tail flicking happily behind him all the while. <br><br>Laughing, Jon turned to Dany and said: \u201cI guess he likes it.\u201d His hands holding the cone were shaking slightly due to the rough impact of Ghost\u2019s hungry licks. <br><br>\u201cYeah! He loves it, Jon.\u201d As their eyes met briefly, Dany tried hard not to swoon. Up close, Jon\u2019s deep brown eyes seemed to gleam like a pool of melted chocolate. She wanted to swim within them and never come up for air. This man was so attractive. <br><br>Ghost had a paw resting against Jon\u2019s fingers as he gnawed at the rapidly diminishing cone. His teeth producing resounding crunching sounds as he chomped. Soon, the cone was obliterated, leaving behind the remains of melted sticky ice cream and bits of waffle cone crumbs on Jon\u2019s fingers and all down the middle of his hands. Ghost\u2019s relentless tongue lapped at his palm, leaving no trace of his new-found love behind. <br><br>Dany\u2019s laughter rang out loud and bright, watching Ghost\u2019s adorable antics and Jon\u2019s heart soared. There it was! That melodious laughter of hers. His eyes watched mesmerized as a bright lovely smile formed on her lips. Her violet eyes were twinkling with mirth.<br><br>Rummaging through her apron pocket, Dany fished out a few pieces of napkins for Jon to clean his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d She offered them to him. <br><br>\u201cThank you.\u201d Taking the napkins from her, Jon meticulously cleaned his fingers before wiping away the ring of cream around his puppy\u2019s mouth and the droplets stuck in his whiskers. Ghost whined in dismay at the loss of his treat. <br><br>\u201cAww. Don\u2019t worry, little one. They\u2019ll be plenty of ice cream for you next time.\u201d Scratching the little patch of skin under his chin, Dany cooed at the puppy. Yipping happily, the pitter patter of his little feet brought him to the edge of the table. Leaping across the space, he jumped straight into the welcoming arms of his new favourite person. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Catching an armful of white fluff, Dany exclaimed. With a giggle, she lifted the dog into the air so that they were face to face. \u201cHello there.\u201d In greeting, the puppy licked a streak across her nose, pulling a laugh from her as her nose scrunched up at the tickly sensation. \u00a0<br><br>Meeting Dany\u2019s smiling eyes, a smitten grin plastered itself upon Jon\u2019s face. He was in love. Seeing the girl of his dreams cuddling his baby, he couldn\u2019t really tell if it was the sight of the two of them together or the woman in front of him that he was in love with. Maybe both. <br><br>Just then, a hoard of school children came thundering up the steps and went charging into the house looking for an after-school treat, breaking the comfortable spell they were under. It would seem like their time was up for now. Dany\u2019s heart sank as her lips turned down into a frown. \u201cI\u2019d better head back in. Missandei probably needs an extra hand.\u201d She muttered, regrettably handing Ghost back to Jon. She dreaded to leave him so soon. They barely got to talking. She liked spending time with him. With a lingering look at Jon over her shoulder, she began her retreat back into her house. <br><br>\u201cOh okay\u2026.\u201d He longed to reach out and grab her hand to make her stay just a bit longer. To keep seeing her smile. He was just getting to know her. Unless\u2026. \u201cDany!\u201d<br><br>Jon\u2019s near yell of her name startled her right out of her skin. Spinning around with her hands clasped in front of her belly, Dany met to nervous features of the charming man who she already found herself coming to adore. \u201cYes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWould you\u2026\u201d Fingers clenching and unclenching against the grainy wood of his bench, Jon struggled to find his bravery. This was all that he\u2019d ever wanted since clapping eyes on her. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. \u201cWould you\u2026 like to go out with me some day?\u201d <br><br>For moments she stood there, mouth slowly falling open. Blinking owlishly down at Jon, Dany\u2019s mind took a beat to process his request before kicking start again, along with the feeling of pure glee. The smile lit up her whole being. He was asking her out! \u201cYes!\u201d<br><br>\u201cReally?\u201d Jon asked, taken aback. Were his ears deceiving him? All he had to do was ask? It was that simple? <br><br>\u201cYes, Jon. I\u2019d like that! Very much.\u201d Teeth finding her bottom lip, she bit down hard. The slight sting of pain told her that this was real. <br><br>\u201cOh.\u201d Now it was his turn to gawp. \u201cWell\u2026. Okay. Cool! Umm\u2026 I\u2019ll come by and get you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhen?\u201d Dany queried breathlessly. Her heart galloped a tattoo so hard she thought it would explode out of the confines of her cage of ribs. She felt as if she could just float away. <br><br>\u201cHow about, this weekend. Sunday?\u201d <br><br>\u201cSure. That sounds lovely.\u201d A giddy giggle stole pass her drawn up lips. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMe too.\u201d A matching grin transformed his lips into a beaming smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again real soon, Dany.\u201d <br><br>With a little nod, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, Dany pushed her front door open. Turning back, she gave Jon a bashful wave before heading back inside, feeling suddenly invigorated. <br><br>Waving back at her with a goofy smile, he watched wistfully as she disappeared through the throng of kids. If he weren\u2019t in public, Jon would have jumped up and did a happy victory jig. Instead, he resorted to sweeping his puppy up in a big hug and rocking him. It was all thanks to Ghost that his first meeting with Dany went so well. Oh, he should probably call his friend up too and give him his thanks for his sagely advice. But that can wait till later. Now, he had a date to plan. <br><br>The work day passed by in a breeze. And if Missandei noticed the spring in her friend\u2019s step and the constant smile pushing at her cheeks, she sure didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019d get the news out of Dany later. It would seem her best girl was well on her way to a new beginning. </p></p>",

Even the simple mention of that man had her stomach fluttering all over. The notion of being a couple with him, in fact with anyone in general, miffed her a bit. It\u2019s been way too long since she\u2019d done anything like that. Would there be safe landing if she took the leap? Would he catch her? <br><br>\u201cYes, missy.\u201d Missandei pointed the ice cream scoop threateningly at Dany, determination written on her face. Rinsing the scoop under the tap to remove any remaining flavour of a prior ice cream before plunging it into a tub of chocolate swirl. She began to gather the creamy goodness to form a ball about the size of an orange. \u201cI won\u2019t have you stuck in this conundrum any longer.\u201d Gingerly transferring the scoop to a chilled sundae cup, her tone softened into something gentler. \u201cI want to see you happy, Dany. You\u2019ve been alone for so long. You need to put yourself out there and give that man a shot while you still can, love. I can tell he\u2019s different. I\u2019m sure you can too.\u201d<br><br>For as long as Dany could remember, men had always fawned over her. As a tween and a teen, she was happy for the attention of those enthusiastic boys. She allowed herself to be swept away by the, in hindsight, very poor flirtatious attempts of those silly high school boys. She was so excited at the thought of maybe finding her first love. Not knowing any better, she caved under the exaggerated displays of affection and flirtatious remarks that a certain popular senior quarter back had bestowed her. They were going to be together forever she thought naively at the time, clinging onto his football jersey sleeve. Unfortunately, it was all just wishful thinking. He never felt that way. They were together for two whole years until it was time for him to leave for college. All he left for her was a voicemail. \u201cYou were fun while it lasted but we both need to grow up.\u201d<br><br>With drying tear tracks and a scab marring her young heart, it was as if a veil over her eyes had been lifted. She had to be cautious now to protect herself. <br>As she grew into a woman she quickly came to realize that what most men only ever cared for was a woman\u2019s physical appearance, her looks and nothing more. They were never interested in her opinions or her interests. They only wanted to show off the fact that they had a beautiful girl on their arm. With time, the pursuit only got worse to the point that she grew sick of them all, so sick of shallow men hitting on her from the get go, so sick of their fragile masculinity and extremely done with feeling like a piece of meat for sale. The piercing glares from the members of her own gender didn\u2019t help either. So, she rejected them, over and over again, man after man, deciding to focus her life being married to her work.\u00a0</p><p>What she never told anyone was that by doing so, she always felt quite lonely. She didn\u2019t date much because she was scared. She was scared that all the men were just the same. They\u2019d use her and kick her to the side. Only Missandei was aware of her fears. <br><br>After all, the olive-skinned beauty was her best pal. She was a great listening ear on the other end of the phone. A soothing balm to cheer her up after every frustrated crying session. The very person who made it a point to list every positive characteristic she could think of in attempts to erase any trace of self-doubt or loathing Dany could have. She\u2019d been there for Dany since they met all those years ago, building sandcastles in the sand box behind their elementary school. Missandei was the only person who stuck by her side through everything. <br><br>Wringing her hands, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, little butterflies flitted to and fro, stirring up a tremor of anxiety that rippled through her being. Missandei was right. Dany did know. Her intuition, her gut told her that that stranger sitting just outside the door was different. He seemed like the type to stand at the sidelines and hide in the shadows at a gathering, almost like he never wanted to stand out. He wasn\u2019t loud and he didn\u2019t demand her attention. He was quiet, he kept to himself and was almost unseemly. All of that was what made her notice him all the more. He wasn\u2019t like any other man she\u2019d met before.<br><br>If she were to be truthful, she was growing tired of being all on her own with the occasional romance novel to fill the void within her heart. She wanted to finally learn what it was like to be truly cared for and loved by a man. She longed to experience what it was like to trust someone with her heart and have them trust her with theirs. \u00a0<br><br>Taking a deep fortifying breath, feeling her lungs expand to their full capacity. Perhaps, now was the time to be brave? The butterflies dispersed and flew out her body with a slow exhale of her breath. <br><br>\u201cOkay.\u201d<br><br>\u201cHmm?\u201d Carefully balancing a scoop of coffee ice cream atop of the chocolate swirl, Missandei hummed. <br><br><i>Here goes nothing.</i><br><br>\u201cWhat was that \u2018in\u2019 that you had in mind?\u201d<br><br>Mouth falling open in a muted gasp, Missandei placed her ice cream scoop down a bit too hard with a clang. Calmly sliding the door of the freezer close, she took a step closer before throwing her arms around Dany. She let out a squeal that reverberated around Dany\u2019s skull. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d She squeezed the mildly flabbergasted smaller woman to her tightly, lifting her up off the ground about an inch and swung her in a clumsy circle. Dany\u2019s chuckles came out a bit muffled against Missandei\u2019s neck. <br><br>\u201cSandie\u2026. You\u2019re squishing me.\u201d Giving her friend\u2019s back a light tap, she urged her to put her down. They still had an order to serve. \u201cAnd the ice cream\u2019s going to melt if you leave it there.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh shoot! Let me serve this up first and I\u2019ll tell you what you need to do in a tick.\u201d Tossing a wink at Dany, Missandei snagged two spoons from the drawer by her hip and some napkins from the dispenser on top of the freezer display and bustled off to serve up the two animatedly chatting teenage girls occupying a booth by the bay windows. Swiftly depositing it on the table between the girls, leaving them with a cheerful \u201cenjoy!\u201d, she hurried back to Dany\u2019s side.<br><br>\u201cSo, here\u2019s the plan.\u201d Dany watched on curiously as Missandei retrieved a mini cone from its stack. Humming a cheery tune, she took a tiny ball of vanilla bean ice cream and <br>pressed it onto the cone. \u201cAll right. You, my friend, are going to take this cone to him.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA baby cone? Did he order another ice cream?\u201d Rising to her tippy toes to glance at the dashing man outside. Just his side profile was present to her, but he really was handsome. One look at him had her feeling so elated. She could stare at him all day. Also, watching his tongue peek out to lick deftly at his mint chocolate chip sent jolts of lust straight down to the centre of her. How she envied those ice cream cones sometimes. <br><br>A loud snigger startled her out of her day dream. Throwing a glare at Missandei, whose raven ringlets were swishing about as she shook with laughter, Dany pouted. \u201cWell\u2026. I was just checking\u2026.\u201d She huffed. Her cheeks were heating up again. <br><br>Eyebrows waggling up and down with a knowing glint in her eye, Missandei asked. Her lips a smirk. \u201cChecking what out hmm?\u201d <br><br>Hiding her flushing cheeks behind her hands, Dany sighed. Her friend knew all about her crush but it still made no difference. In fact, it probably made it worse because of the teasing. If the ground opened and swallowed her up, that would be perfect. All of this was so embarrassing. Where did her composure flee to? She was an adult close to thirty!<br><br>Still laughing, Missandei pulled a hand away from Dany\u2019s face. Placing the cone in it, she folded her fingers around it. \u201cThis is your key. The opening you need.\u201d<br><br>Looking down at the cone, a furrow etched itself between her dark brows. \u201cGive him a baby cone? He already has one.\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for Jon. It\u2019s for his puppy!\u201d Missandei beamed at her. She was confident that this would work. Nodding enthusiastically, she turned Dany around and began marching her friend towards the door. <br><br>\u201cWhat puppy?\u201d Dany asked confused before back tracking. Her mind replaying what her friend had said. \u201cWait\u2026 Jon?\u201d She exclaimed with a gasp. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she whirled around. The ice cream cone barely missing Missandei\u2019s blouse.<br><br>\u201cJon!\u201d She repeated in a low hiss. \u201cIs that\u2026 is that his name? You knew his name and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cI only just found out! He told me when I was taking his order just now.\u201d Missandei didn\u2019t even bother resisting her amusement or curb her enjoyment at Dany\u2019s predicament. \u201cHis name is Jon Snow.\u201d<br><br>\u201cJon\u2026. Snow\u2026\u201d The two words that made up a huge part of his identity rolled slowly over her tongue. She finally had a name for her to put to his face. It suited him well. It suited his physique perfectly too for he was beautiful, like fresh snow falling from the ski. <br><br>The sight of Dany\u2019s enamoured smile and the dreamy look in her eyes directed at the man munching on his waffle cone just a few feet away, was an image that Missandei had never seen the petite lady wear before. <br><br>Rubbing a comforting hand over Dany\u2019s back, Missandei could tell. Her friend was in love. Drawing Dany in for a brief hug, she supplied her long-time bestie with one more push. \u201cYou deserve happiness and I think he might be good for you. Don\u2019t let him slip you by.\u201d Slowly, turning Dany towards the door and possibly a new romance once more, Missandei began guiding her towards it. <br><br>Gulping, Dany\u2019s stomach churned, gripped by the hands of nervousness. This was worse than facing down her fear of public speaking as a kid. Heck, the fear was back, tenfold. As they made their way pass the freezer display, she felt like she was going to throw up. The hands clutching tightly at her shoulders were the only things that made her feel just a tad better. The front door of her parlour loomed ahead. <br><br>\u201cBut\u2026 Hold up!\u201d Shrugging Missandei\u2019s hands away, she turned to ask a question that she just realized that she should have thought about before agreeing to this. Her eyes were filled with uncertainty and fear. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh boy, trust me girl, he does. So very much! I saw the way he looked at you when you ran away from him to the back earlier.\u201d<br><br>Fingers digging into Missandei\u2019s forearm, she squeaked: \u201cHe saw me?\u201d <br><br>Nodding fervently, Missandei moved her friend\u2019s talon like fingers away from her flesh and into the cradle of her hands. Holding her small clammy hand in hers, she informed Dany of what she had seen, without a scratch of doubt: \u201cThe man is crazy about you! He was so sad when you weren\u2019t the one taking his order. He was practically following you with his desolate eyes when you fled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d Dany was astounded. This was news to her! Her crush had a crush on her too? \u201cBut, that sounds too good to be tr\u2026?\u201d <br><br>\u201cTrust me! He likes you Dany! Just start with \u2018hello\u2019. You got this.\u201d Throwing on her fiercest scowl, with a fist waving at Jon\u2019s back, Missandei gave Dany her word. \u201cIf the worst happens and he hurts you, I\u2019ll kick his ass! That black belt in karate of mine will finally be put to good use.\u201d <br><br>With a shaky laugh, her nerves settled a little bit. Grasping the cone more firmly in her hand, Dany reached out with her other for the door handle. Yanking the heavy wooden door open a crack, the cool spring breeze and the smell of clean, crisp air from the outside drifted over her. Eyes darting to the left, her heart nearly jumped into her mouth. Jon was right there! <br><br>Oh my god! I\u2019m actually doing this! Dany\u2019s mind yelled out as her heart did summersaults within her chest. Taking a small step towards Jon, she winced as the boards creaked under her weight. <br><br>Sensing someone behind him, his hand paused in mid composition. The crotchet he was sketching on a page of his five lined manuscript had yet to have a tail. Turning to see who it was creeping up on him, his pencil fell from his grip and his mouth fell agape in shock. Daenerys was staring right back at him. <br><br>Time seemed to came to a standstill as wide brown eyes and violet ones met, like two deer caught in the headlights of a car.<br><br>Oh. My. God.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s her! (It\u2019s him!)<br><br>Their inner selves were screaming. <br><br>\u201cHi!\u201d <br><br>\u201cHello!\u201d <br><br>They yelled out at the same time. A long moment of silence shrouded them both. Gosh this was awkward. It would seem that neither of them knew how to function properly at the sight of one another up close. Their cheeks were getting redder by the second. Chuckling nervously, Jon ran a hand through his unruly curls while Dany giggled, head ducking down to look at the now melting cone. The cream was starting to dribble down the sides into the napkin tucked around it. <br><br>\u201cUmm\u2026 let\u2019s start over. My name is Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d Her voice came out small. Clearing her throat and taking a shallow breath, she forced some confidence back into her veins and looked straight at the gorgeous man before her. \u201cBut you can call me Dany.\u201d <br><br>She presented him with the most stunning smile he had the pleasure to see. That same one he saw so many times now, but finally directed in his direction. It was blinding up close. He was captivated. And her voice! It sounded so smooth and velvety, like the creamiest, sweetest, warmest, fudgiest chocolate syrup. And her eyes! He could easily drown in those purple irises. They reminded him of summers running through fields of lavender blossoms that swayed in the breeze. She was absolutely perfect. <br><br>\u201cH\u2026hello?\u201d Dany waved a hand in front of his eyes. <br><br>Blinking out of his daze, he realized he\u2019d been staring at her for quite some time. Embarrassed, he looked away, rubbing his palms against his thighs, feeling the friction of his jeans under his skin.\u201cSorry\u2026 it\u2019s just you\u2019re even more breath taking up close. The most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d He muttered, eyes a bit glazed over. Realising how creepy his must have sounded, he immediately apologized again with a grimace pinching at his features. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too forward of me! I\u2026\u201d<br><br>\u201cNo! It\u2019s okay. Umm\u2026 thank you.\u201d Overcome by an unfamiliar sense of demureness, Dany\u2019s smile was a tiny, shy one. A wave of heat graced her cheeks. Oddly enough, a compliment from this man didn\u2019t make her skin crawl or her ire rise. Instead, it made her heart pound even faster and strangely light.<br><br>Motioning to the empty space beside him on the bench, Dany queried:\u201cMind if I joined you?\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou can join with me anytime. I mean\u2026. no\u2026 I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Cringing hard, Jon groaned, his body tensed up waiting for her reaction. Would she be repulsed at him and flee? He didn\u2019t mean for that line to come out like that. His mouth just ran away from him.</p><p>To his utter pleasant surprise, Dany was still standing before him. With lips pressed together firmly, she fought hard not to laugh. She was actually tickled at his slip up. This man was adorably cute. Seeing the embarrassed grin taking its place on Jon\u2019s lips, the giggle she was trying to supress broke free. Silly sniggers consumed the two of them until they faded, leaving them just staring at each other for long moments. <br><br>\u201cUmm yeah here, let me just\u2026\u201d Shaking himself out of his mystified state, Jon turned his attention to his belongings.<br><br>\u201cThanks so much.\u201d Dany gasped. Another nervous giggle trailed behind her words as she moved closer to the table. <br><br>When a startled yelp came from his puppy he realized in his hurry to clear space for Dany, he had accidentally shoved his manuscript book into a snoozing Ghost\u2019s paw. He was awake now and upset. His little whines intermingled with sleepy whimpers and growls.Hurriedly, Jon picked up the puppy and cuddled him close. \u201cOh crap. I\u2019m so sorry, boy!\u201d Tenderly stroking his little paw to soothe the pain. Ghost\u2019s pitiful whines gutted him. His poor puppy! <br><br>Gingerly perching herself on the bench beside them, Dany\u2019s heart melted at the sight. He really did have a puppy with him today. The baby husky pup was the sweetest little thing. He held up his little bruised paw to Jon, requesting him to kiss it well. Dany smiled as Jon did just that. He embraced the little white pup, his fingers stroking through the strands of soft, snow white fur, kissing his furry face again and again. Gradually, Ghost\u2019s tail began to wag cheerfully and the puppy started returning his father\u2019s kisses with his own. Her heart was a puddle inside her chest cavity. She thinks that she might be in love. With the man or his dog, she wasn\u2019t too sure yet. <br><br>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Jon said in her direction. \u201cThis is so embarrassing. I\u2019m usually not this clumsy. Poor Ghost.\u201d He buried his red face in his dog\u2019s fur. He couldn\u2019t believe Dany had to witness him like this. <br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s really all right, Jon. Well, not alright for your puppy because he got hurt but\u2026\u201d Ramblings. Where did that come from, she wondered to herself.<br><br>Hearing his name, Jon peeked up at her. \u201cForgive me for cutting you off. But umm\u2026 How did you know my name?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh. Missandei told me.\u201d Dany informed him with a smile. She couldn\u2019t seem to keep it off of her face with him around. \u201cShe also gave me this.\u201d Lifting up the rapidly melting cone, Dany showed it to him. \u201cFor the little guy.\u201d<br><br>\u201cShe mentioned about a treat but you guys really shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Shifting Ghost to sit on his lap with a hand around his belly to keep the pup from slipping away, Jon reached out to take the cone from Dany.</p><p>Their fingers touched just for a second and it was like lightning. They both felt it. That jolt of electricity passing from their fingers lighting up every nerve ending in their bodies. With a sharp intake of breath, they both jumped apart, retracting their hands away from each other. Dany sat ramrod straight with her tingly fingers of her right hand interlaced together with her left on her lap while Jon coughed.<br><br>\u201cWell, let us see if Ghost likes ice cream, shall we?\u201d <br><br>\u201cI\u2019ve seen little children try ice cream for the first time. A puppy has to be a first for me!\u201d Reaching for his little paw, she gave it a shake. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll make him feel better too.\u201d <br><br>\u201cCome on, back on the table you go.\u201d Gently placing the white puppy back on the picnic table, Jon presented the cone to him. <br><br>Dany watched in awe as Ghost\u2019s little black snout sniffed, sniffed, sniffed at the ball of melting vanilla ice. His little pink tongue poked out to give it a tentative taste. With a delighted bark, he plunged his whole body into the treat, eagerly slobbering up the dripping white delight. His little wisp of a tail flicking happily behind him all the while. <br><br>Laughing, Jon turned to Dany and said: \u201cI guess he likes it.\u201d His hands holding the cone were shaking slightly due to the rough impact of Ghost\u2019s hungry licks. <br><br>\u201cYeah! He loves it, Jon.\u201d As their eyes met briefly, Dany tried hard not to swoon. Up close, Jon\u2019s deep brown eyes seemed to gleam like a pool of melted chocolate. She wanted to swim within them and never come up for air. This man was so attractive. <br><br>Ghost had a paw resting against Jon\u2019s fingers as he gnawed at the rapidly diminishing cone. His teeth producing resounding crunching sounds as he chomped. Soon, the cone was obliterated, leaving behind the remains of melted sticky ice cream and bits of waffle cone crumbs on Jon\u2019s fingers and all down the middle of his hands. Ghost\u2019s relentless tongue lapped at his palm, leaving no trace of his new-found love behind. <br><br>Dany\u2019s laughter rang out loud and bright, watching Ghost\u2019s adorable antics and Jon\u2019s heart soared. There it was! That melodious laughter of hers. His eyes watched mesmerized as a bright lovely smile formed on her lips. Her violet eyes were twinkling with mirth.<br><br>Rummaging through her apron pocket, Dany fished out a few pieces of napkins for Jon to clean his hands. \u201cHere.\u201d She offered them to him. <br><br>\u201cThank you.\u201d Taking the napkins from her, Jon meticulously cleaned his fingers before wiping away the ring of cream around his puppy\u2019s mouth and the droplets stuck in his whiskers. Ghost whined in dismay at the loss of his treat. <br><br>\u201cAww. Don\u2019t worry, little one. They\u2019ll be plenty of ice cream for you next time.\u201d Scratching the little patch of skin under his chin, Dany cooed at the puppy. Yipping happily, the pitter patter of his little feet brought him to the edge of the table. Leaping across the space, he jumped straight into the welcoming arms of his new favourite person. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Catching an armful of white fluff, Dany exclaimed. With a giggle, she lifted the dog into the air so that they were face to face. \u201cHello there.\u201d In greeting, the puppy licked a streak across her nose, pulling a laugh from her as her nose scrunched up at the tickly sensation. \u00a0<br><br>Meeting Dany\u2019s smiling eyes, a smitten grin plastered itself upon Jon\u2019s face. He was in love. Seeing the girl of his dreams cuddling his baby, he couldn\u2019t really tell if it was the sight of the two of them together or the woman in front of him that he was in love with. Maybe both. <br><br>Just then, a hoard of school children came thundering up the steps and went charging into the house looking for an after-school treat, breaking the comfortable spell they were under. It would seem like their time was up for now. Dany\u2019s heart sank as her lips turned down into a frown. \u201cI\u2019d better head back in. Missandei probably needs an extra hand.\u201d She muttered, regrettably handing Ghost back to Jon. She dreaded to leave him so soon. They barely got to talking. She liked spending time with him. With a lingering look at Jon over her shoulder, she began her retreat back into her house. <br><br>\u201cOh okay\u2026.\u201d He longed to reach out and grab her hand to make her stay just a bit longer. To keep seeing her smile. He was just getting to know her. Unless\u2026. \u201cDany!\u201d<br><br>Jon\u2019s near yell of her name startled her right out of her skin. Spinning around with her hands clasped in front of her belly, Dany met to nervous features of the charming man who she already found herself coming to adore. \u201cYes?\u201d<br><br>\u201cWould you\u2026\u201d Fingers clenching and unclenching against the grainy wood of his bench, Jon struggled to find his bravery. This was all that he\u2019d ever wanted since clapping eyes on her. He couldn\u2019t screw this up. \u201cWould you\u2026 like to go out with me some day?\u201d <br><br>For moments she stood there, mouth slowly falling open. Blinking owlishly down at Jon, Dany\u2019s mind took a beat to process his request before kicking start again, along with the feeling of pure glee. The smile lit up her whole being. He was asking her out! \u201cYes!\u201d<br><br>\u201cReally?\u201d Jon asked, taken aback. Were his ears deceiving him? All he had to do was ask? It was that simple? <br><br>\u201cYes, Jon. I\u2019d like that! Very much.\u201d Teeth finding her bottom lip, she bit down hard. The slight sting of pain told her that this was real. <br><br>\u201cOh.\u201d Now it was his turn to gawp. \u201cWell\u2026. Okay. Cool! Umm\u2026 I\u2019ll come by and get you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cWhen?\u201d Dany queried breathlessly. Her heart galloped a tattoo so hard she thought it would explode out of the confines of her cage of ribs. She felt as if she could just float away. <br><br>\u201cHow about, this weekend. Sunday?\u201d <br><br>\u201cSure. That sounds lovely.\u201d A giddy giggle stole pass her drawn up lips. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d <br><br>\u201cMe too.\u201d A matching grin transformed his lips into a beaming smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you again real soon, Dany.\u201d <br><br>With a little nod, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, Dany pushed her front door open. Turning back, she gave Jon a bashful wave before heading back inside, feeling suddenly invigorated. <br><br>Waving back at her with a goofy smile, he watched wistfully as she disappeared through the throng of kids. If he weren\u2019t in public, Jon would have jumped up and did a happy victory jig. Instead, he resorted to sweeping his puppy up in a big hug and rocking him. It was all thanks to Ghost that his first meeting with Dany went so well. Oh, he should probably call his friend up too and give him his thanks for his sagely advice. But that can wait till later. Now, he had a date to plan. <br><br>The work day passed by in a breeze. And if Missandei noticed the spring in her friend\u2019s step and the constant smile pushing at her cheeks, she sure didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019d get the news out of Dany later. It would seem her best girl was well on her way to a new beginning. </p></p>",

Even the simple mention of that man had her stomach fluttering all over. The notion of being a couple with him, in fact with anyone in general, miffed her a bit. It&rsquo;s been way too long since she&rsquo;d done anything like that. Would there be safe landing if she took the leap? Would he catch her? <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, missy.&rdquo; Missandei pointed the ice cream scoop threateningly at Dany, determination written on her face. Rinsing the scoop under the tap to remove any remaining flavour of a prior ice cream before plunging it into a tub of chocolate swirl. She began to gather the creamy goodness to form a ball about the size of an orange. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you stuck in this conundrum any longer.&rdquo; Gingerly transferring the scoop to a chilled sundae cup, her tone softened into something gentler. &ldquo;I want to see you happy, Dany. You&rsquo;ve been alone for so long. You need to put yourself out there and give that man a shot while you still can, love. I can tell he&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m sure you can too.&rdquo;<br /><br />For as long as Dany could remember, men had always fawned over her. As a tween and a teen, she was happy for the attention of those enthusiastic boys. She allowed herself to be swept away by the, in hindsight, very poor flirtatious attempts of those silly high school boys. She was so excited at the thought of maybe finding her first love. Not knowing any better, she caved under the exaggerated displays of affection and flirtatious remarks that a certain popular senior quarter back had bestowed her. They were going to be together forever she thought naively at the time, clinging onto his football jersey sleeve. Unfortunately, it was all just wishful thinking. He never felt that way. They were together for two whole years until it was time for him to leave for college. All he left for her was a voicemail. &ldquo;You were fun while it lasted but we both need to grow up.&rdquo;<br /><br />With drying tear tracks and a scab marring her young heart, it was as if a veil over her eyes had been lifted. She had to be cautious now to protect herself. <br />As she grew into a woman she quickly came to realize that what most men only ever cared for was a woman&rsquo;s physical appearance, her looks and nothing more. They were never interested in her opinions or her interests. They only wanted to show off the fact that they had a beautiful girl on their arm. With time, the pursuit only got worse to the point that she grew sick of them all, so sick of shallow men hitting on her from the get go, so sick of their fragile masculinity and extremely done with feeling like a piece of meat for sale. The piercing glares from the members of her own gender didn&rsquo;t help either. So, she rejected them, over and over again, man after man, deciding to focus her life being married to her work.&nbsp;</p><p>What she never told anyone was that by doing so, she always felt quite lonely. She didn&rsquo;t date much because she was scared. She was scared that all the men were just the same. They&rsquo;d use her and kick her to the side. Only Missandei was aware of her fears. <br /><br />After all, the olive-skinned beauty was her best pal. She was a great listening ear on the other end of the phone. A soothing balm to cheer her up after every frustrated crying session. The very person who made it a point to list every positive characteristic she could think of in attempts to erase any trace of self-doubt or loathing Dany could have. She&rsquo;d been there for Dany since they met all those years ago, building sandcastles in the sand box behind their elementary school. Missandei was the only person who stuck by her side through everything. <br /><br />Wringing her hands, Dany&rsquo;s stomach churned, little butterflies flitted to and fro, stirring up a tremor of anxiety that rippled through her being. Missandei was right. Dany did know. Her intuition, her gut told her that that stranger sitting just outside the door was different. He seemed like the type to stand at the sidelines and hide in the shadows at a gathering, almost like he never wanted to stand out. He wasn&rsquo;t loud and he didn&rsquo;t demand her attention. He was quiet, he kept to himself and was almost unseemly. All of that was what made her notice him all the more. He wasn&rsquo;t like any other man she&rsquo;d met before.<br /><br />If she were to be truthful, she was growing tired of being all on her own with the occasional romance novel to fill the void within her heart. She wanted to finally learn what it was like to be truly cared for and loved by a man. She longed to experience what it was like to trust someone with her heart and have them trust her with theirs. &nbsp;<br /><br />Taking a deep fortifying breath, feeling her lungs expand to their full capacity. Perhaps, now was the time to be brave? The butterflies dispersed and flew out her body with a slow exhale of her breath. <br /><br />&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; Carefully balancing a scoop of coffee ice cream atop of the chocolate swirl, Missandei hummed. <br /><br /><i>Here goes nothing.</i><br /><br />&ldquo;What was that &lsquo;in&rsquo; that you had in mind?&rdquo;<br /><br />Mouth falling open in a muted gasp, Missandei placed her ice cream scoop down a bit too hard with a clang. Calmly sliding the door of the freezer close, she took a step closer before throwing her arms around Dany. She let out a squeal that reverberated around Dany&rsquo;s skull. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you!&rdquo; She squeezed the mildly flabbergasted smaller woman to her tightly, lifting her up off the ground about an inch and swung her in a clumsy circle. Dany&rsquo;s chuckles came out a bit muffled against Missandei&rsquo;s neck. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sandie&hellip;. You&rsquo;re squishing me.&rdquo; Giving her friend&rsquo;s back a light tap, she urged her to put her down. They still had an order to serve. &ldquo;And the ice cream&rsquo;s going to melt if you leave it there.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh shoot! Let me serve this up first and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you need to do in a tick.&rdquo; Tossing a wink at Dany, Missandei snagged two spoons from the drawer by her hip and some napkins from the dispenser on top of the freezer display and bustled off to serve up the two animatedly chatting teenage girls occupying a booth by the bay windows. Swiftly depositing it on the table between the girls, leaving them with a cheerful &ldquo;enjoy!&rdquo;, she hurried back to Dany&rsquo;s side.<br /><br />&ldquo;So, here&rsquo;s the plan.&rdquo; Dany watched on curiously as Missandei retrieved a mini cone from its stack. Humming a cheery tune, she took a tiny ball of vanilla bean ice cream and <br />pressed it onto the cone. &ldquo;All right. You, my friend, are going to take this cone to him.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;A baby cone? Did he order another ice cream?&rdquo; Rising to her tippy toes to glance at the dashing man outside. Just his side profile was present to her, but he really was handsome. One look at him had her feeling so elated. She could stare at him all day. Also, watching his tongue peek out to lick deftly at his mint chocolate chip sent jolts of lust straight down to the centre of her. How she envied those ice cream cones sometimes. <br /><br />A loud snigger startled her out of her day dream. Throwing a glare at Missandei, whose raven ringlets were swishing about as she shook with laughter, Dany pouted. &ldquo;Well&hellip;. I was just checking&hellip;.&rdquo; She huffed. Her cheeks were heating up again. <br /><br />Eyebrows waggling up and down with a knowing glint in her eye, Missandei asked. Her lips a smirk. &ldquo;Checking what out hmm?&rdquo; <br /><br />Hiding her flushing cheeks behind her hands, Dany sighed. Her friend knew all about her crush but it still made no difference. In fact, it probably made it worse because of the teasing. If the ground opened and swallowed her up, that would be perfect. All of this was so embarrassing. Where did her composure flee to? She was an adult close to thirty!<br /><br />Still laughing, Missandei pulled a hand away from Dany&rsquo;s face. Placing the cone in it, she folded her fingers around it. &ldquo;This is your key. The opening you need.&rdquo;<br /><br />Looking down at the cone, a furrow etched itself between her dark brows. &ldquo;Give him a baby cone? He already has one.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not for Jon. It&rsquo;s for his puppy!&rdquo; Missandei beamed at her. She was confident that this would work. Nodding enthusiastically, she turned Dany around and began marching her friend towards the door. <br /><br />&ldquo;What puppy?&rdquo; Dany asked confused before back tracking. Her mind replaying what her friend had said. &ldquo;Wait&hellip; Jon?&rdquo; She exclaimed with a gasp. Planting her feet firmly into the ground, she whirled around. The ice cream cone barely missing Missandei&rsquo;s blouse.<br /><br />&ldquo;Jon!&rdquo; She repeated in a low hiss. &ldquo;Is that&hellip; is that his name? You knew his name and you didn&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I only just found out! He told me when I was taking his order just now.&rdquo; Missandei didn&rsquo;t even bother resisting her amusement or curb her enjoyment at Dany&rsquo;s predicament. &ldquo;His name is Jon Snow.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Jon&hellip;. Snow&hellip;&rdquo; The two words that made up a huge part of his identity rolled slowly over her tongue. She finally had a name for her to put to his face. It suited him well. It suited his physique perfectly too for he was beautiful, like fresh snow falling from the ski. <br /><br />The sight of Dany&rsquo;s enamoured smile and the dreamy look in her eyes directed at the man munching on his waffle cone just a few feet away, was an image that Missandei had never seen the petite lady wear before. <br /><br />Rubbing a comforting hand over Dany&rsquo;s back, Missandei could tell. Her friend was in love. Drawing Dany in for a brief hug, she supplied her long-time bestie with one more push. &ldquo;You deserve happiness and I think he might be good for you. Don&rsquo;t let him slip you by.&rdquo; Slowly, turning Dany towards the door and possibly a new romance once more, Missandei began guiding her towards it. <br /><br />Gulping, Dany&rsquo;s stomach churned, gripped by the hands of nervousness. This was worse than facing down her fear of public speaking as a kid. Heck, the fear was back, tenfold. As they made their way pass the freezer display, she felt like she was going to throw up. The hands clutching tightly at her shoulders were the only things that made her feel just a tad better. The front door of her parlour loomed ahead. <br /><br />&ldquo;But&hellip; Hold up!&rdquo; Shrugging Missandei&rsquo;s hands away, she turned to ask a question that she just realized that she should have thought about before agreeing to this. Her eyes were filled with uncertainty and fear. &ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh boy, trust me girl, he does. So very much! I saw the way he looked at you when you ran away from him to the back earlier.&rdquo;<br /><br />Fingers digging into Missandei&rsquo;s forearm, she squeaked: &ldquo;He saw me?&rdquo; <br /><br />Nodding fervently, Missandei moved her friend&rsquo;s talon like fingers away from her flesh and into the cradle of her hands. Holding her small clammy hand in hers, she informed Dany of what she had seen, without a scratch of doubt: &ldquo;The man is crazy about you! He was so sad when you weren&rsquo;t the one taking his order. He was practically following you with his desolate eyes when you fled!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness.&rdquo; Dany was astounded. This was news to her! Her crush had a crush on her too? &ldquo;But, that sounds too good to be tr&hellip;?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Trust me! He likes you Dany! Just start with &lsquo;hello&rsquo;. You got this.&rdquo; Throwing on her fiercest scowl, with a fist waving at Jon&rsquo;s back, Missandei gave Dany her word. &ldquo;If the worst happens and he hurts you, I&rsquo;ll kick his ass! That black belt in karate of mine will finally be put to good use.&rdquo; <br /><br />With a shaky laugh, her nerves settled a little bit. Grasping the cone more firmly in her hand, Dany reached out with her other for the door handle. Yanking the heavy wooden door open a crack, the cool spring breeze and the smell of clean, crisp air from the outside drifted over her. Eyes darting to the left, her heart nearly jumped into her mouth. Jon was right there! <br /><br />Oh my god! I&rsquo;m actually doing this! Dany&rsquo;s mind yelled out as her heart did summersaults within her chest. Taking a small step towards Jon, she winced as the boards creaked under her weight. <br /><br />Sensing someone behind him, his hand paused in mid composition. The crotchet he was sketching on a page of his five lined manuscript had yet to have a tail. Turning to see who it was creeping up on him, his pencil fell from his grip and his mouth fell agape in shock. Daenerys was staring right back at him. <br /><br />Time seemed to came to a standstill as wide brown eyes and violet ones met, like two deer caught in the headlights of a car.<br /><br />Oh. My. God.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s her! (It&rsquo;s him!)<br /><br />Their inner selves were screaming. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; <br /><br />They yelled out at the same time. A long moment of silence shrouded them both. Gosh this was awkward. It would seem that neither of them knew how to function properly at the sight of one another up close. Their cheeks were getting redder by the second. Chuckling nervously, Jon ran a hand through his unruly curls while Dany giggled, head ducking down to look at the now melting cone. The cream was starting to dribble down the sides into the napkin tucked around it. <br /><br />&ldquo;Umm&hellip; let&rsquo;s start over. My name is Daenerys Targaryen.&rdquo; Her voice came out small. Clearing her throat and taking a shallow breath, she forced some confidence back into her veins and looked straight at the gorgeous man before her. &ldquo;But you can call me Dany.&rdquo; <br /><br />She presented him with the most stunning smile he had the pleasure to see. That same one he saw so many times now, but finally directed in his direction. It was blinding up close. He was captivated. And her voice! It sounded so smooth and velvety, like the creamiest, sweetest, warmest, fudgiest chocolate syrup. And her eyes! He could easily drown in those purple irises. They reminded him of summers running through fields of lavender blossoms that swayed in the breeze. She was absolutely perfect. <br /><br />&ldquo;H&hellip;hello?&rdquo; Dany waved a hand in front of his eyes. <br /><br />Blinking out of his daze, he realized he&rsquo;d been staring at her for quite some time. Embarrassed, he looked away, rubbing his palms against his thighs, feeling the friction of his jeans under his skin.&ldquo;Sorry&hellip; it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re even more breath taking up close. The most beautiful woman I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; He muttered, eyes a bit glazed over. Realising how creepy his must have sounded, he immediately apologized again with a grimace pinching at his features. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. That was too forward of me! I&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s okay. Umm&hellip; thank you.&rdquo; Overcome by an unfamiliar sense of demureness, Dany&rsquo;s smile was a tiny, shy one. A wave of heat graced her cheeks. Oddly enough, a compliment from this man didn&rsquo;t make her skin crawl or her ire rise. Instead, it made her heart pound even faster and strangely light.<br /><br />Motioning to the empty space beside him on the bench, Dany queried:&ldquo;Mind if I joined you?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;You can join with me anytime. I mean&hellip;. no&hellip; I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; Cringing hard, Jon groaned, his body tensed up waiting for her reaction. Would she be repulsed at him and flee? He didn&rsquo;t mean for that line to come out like that. His mouth just ran away from him.</p><p>To his utter pleasant surprise, Dany was still standing before him. With lips pressed together firmly, she fought hard not to laugh. She was actually tickled at his slip up. This man was adorably cute. Seeing the embarrassed grin taking its place on Jon&rsquo;s lips, the giggle she was trying to supress broke free. Silly sniggers consumed the two of them until they faded, leaving them just staring at each other for long moments. <br /><br />&ldquo;Umm yeah here, let me just&hellip;&rdquo; Shaking himself out of his mystified state, Jon turned his attention to his belongings.<br /><br />&ldquo;Thanks so much.&rdquo; Dany gasped. Another nervous giggle trailed behind her words as she moved closer to the table. <br /><br />When a startled yelp came from his puppy he realized in his hurry to clear space for Dany, he had accidentally shoved his manuscript book into a snoozing Ghost&rsquo;s paw. He was awake now and upset. His little whines intermingled with sleepy whimpers and growls.Hurriedly, Jon picked up the puppy and cuddled him close. &ldquo;Oh crap. I&rsquo;m so sorry, boy!&rdquo; Tenderly stroking his little paw to soothe the pain. Ghost&rsquo;s pitiful whines gutted him. His poor puppy! <br /><br />Gingerly perching herself on the bench beside them, Dany&rsquo;s heart melted at the sight. He really did have a puppy with him today. The baby husky pup was the sweetest little thing. He held up his little bruised paw to Jon, requesting him to kiss it well. Dany smiled as Jon did just that. He embraced the little white pup, his fingers stroking through the strands of soft, snow white fur, kissing his furry face again and again. Gradually, Ghost&rsquo;s tail began to wag cheerfully and the puppy started returning his father&rsquo;s kisses with his own. Her heart was a puddle inside her chest cavity. She thinks that she might be in love. With the man or his dog, she wasn&rsquo;t too sure yet. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry about that.&rdquo; Jon said in her direction. &ldquo;This is so embarrassing. I&rsquo;m usually not this clumsy. Poor Ghost.&rdquo; He buried his red face in his dog&rsquo;s fur. He couldn&rsquo;t believe Dany had to witness him like this. <br /><br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize. It&rsquo;s really all right, Jon. Well, not alright for your puppy because he got hurt but&hellip;&rdquo; Ramblings. Where did that come from, she wondered to herself.<br /><br />Hearing his name, Jon peeked up at her. &ldquo;Forgive me for cutting you off. But umm&hellip; How did you know my name?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh. Missandei told me.&rdquo; Dany informed him with a smile. She couldn&rsquo;t seem to keep it off of her face with him around. &ldquo;She also gave me this.&rdquo; Lifting up the rapidly melting cone, Dany showed it to him. &ldquo;For the little guy.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;She mentioned about a treat but you guys really shouldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; Shifting Ghost to sit on his lap with a hand around his belly to keep the pup from slipping away, Jon reached out to take the cone from Dany.</p><p>Their fingers touched just for a second and it was like lightning. They both felt it. That jolt of electricity passing from their fingers lighting up every nerve ending in their bodies. With a sharp intake of breath, they both jumped apart, retracting their hands away from each other. Dany sat ramrod straight with her tingly fingers of her right hand interlaced together with her left on her lap while Jon coughed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, let us see if Ghost likes ice cream, shall we?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen little children try ice cream for the first time. A puppy has to be a first for me!&rdquo; Reaching for his little paw, she gave it a shake. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;ll make him feel better too.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Come on, back on the table you go.&rdquo; Gently placing the white puppy back on the picnic table, Jon presented the cone to him. <br /><br />Dany watched in awe as Ghost&rsquo;s little black snout sniffed, sniffed, sniffed at the ball of melting vanilla ice. His little pink tongue poked out to give it a tentative taste. With a delighted bark, he plunged his whole body into the treat, eagerly slobbering up the dripping white delight. His little wisp of a tail flicking happily behind him all the while. <br /><br />Laughing, Jon turned to Dany and said: &ldquo;I guess he likes it.&rdquo; His hands holding the cone were shaking slightly due to the rough impact of Ghost&rsquo;s hungry licks. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah! He loves it, Jon.&rdquo; As their eyes met briefly, Dany tried hard not to swoon. Up close, Jon&rsquo;s deep brown eyes seemed to gleam like a pool of melted chocolate. She wanted to swim within them and never come up for air. This man was so attractive. <br /><br />Ghost had a paw resting against Jon&rsquo;s fingers as he gnawed at the rapidly diminishing cone. His teeth producing resounding crunching sounds as he chomped. Soon, the cone was obliterated, leaving behind the remains of melted sticky ice cream and bits of waffle cone crumbs on Jon&rsquo;s fingers and all down the middle of his hands. Ghost&rsquo;s relentless tongue lapped at his palm, leaving no trace of his new-found love behind. <br /><br />Dany&rsquo;s laughter rang out loud and bright, watching Ghost&rsquo;s adorable antics and Jon&rsquo;s heart soared. There it was! That melodious laughter of hers. His eyes watched mesmerized as a bright lovely smile formed on her lips. Her violet eyes were twinkling with mirth.<br /><br />Rummaging through her apron pocket, Dany fished out a few pieces of napkins for Jon to clean his hands. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; She offered them to him. <br /><br />&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Taking the napkins from her, Jon meticulously cleaned his fingers before wiping away the ring of cream around his puppy&rsquo;s mouth and the droplets stuck in his whiskers. Ghost whined in dismay at the loss of his treat. <br /><br />&ldquo;Aww. Don&rsquo;t worry, little one. They&rsquo;ll be plenty of ice cream for you next time.&rdquo; Scratching the little patch of skin under his chin, Dany cooed at the puppy. Yipping happily, the pitter patter of his little feet brought him to the edge of the table. Leaping across the space, he jumped straight into the welcoming arms of his new favourite person. &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; Catching an armful of white fluff, Dany exclaimed. With a giggle, she lifted the dog into the air so that they were face to face. &ldquo;Hello there.&rdquo; In greeting, the puppy licked a streak across her nose, pulling a laugh from her as her nose scrunched up at the tickly sensation. &nbsp;<br /><br />Meeting Dany&rsquo;s smiling eyes, a smitten grin plastered itself upon Jon&rsquo;s face. He was in love. Seeing the girl of his dreams cuddling his baby, he couldn&rsquo;t really tell if it was the sight of the two of them together or the woman in front of him that he was in love with. Maybe both. <br /><br />Just then, a hoard of school children came thundering up the steps and went charging into the house looking for an after-school treat, breaking the comfortable spell they were under. It would seem like their time was up for now. Dany&rsquo;s heart sank as her lips turned down into a frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better head back in. Missandei probably needs an extra hand.&rdquo; She muttered, regrettably handing Ghost back to Jon. She dreaded to leave him so soon. They barely got to talking. She liked spending time with him. With a lingering look at Jon over her shoulder, she began her retreat back into her house. <br /><br />&ldquo;Oh okay&hellip;.&rdquo; He longed to reach out and grab her hand to make her stay just a bit longer. To keep seeing her smile. He was just getting to know her. Unless&hellip;. &ldquo;Dany!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jon&rsquo;s near yell of her name startled her right out of her skin. Spinning around with her hands clasped in front of her belly, Dany met to nervous features of the charming man who she already found herself coming to adore. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Would you&hellip;&rdquo; Fingers clenching and unclenching against the grainy wood of his bench, Jon struggled to find his bravery. This was all that he&rsquo;d ever wanted since clapping eyes on her. He couldn&rsquo;t screw this up. &ldquo;Would you&hellip; like to go out with me some day?&rdquo; <br /><br />For moments she stood there, mouth slowly falling open. Blinking owlishly down at Jon, Dany&rsquo;s mind took a beat to process his request before kicking start again, along with the feeling of pure glee. The smile lit up her whole being. He was asking her out! &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Jon asked, taken aback. Were his ears deceiving him? All he had to do was ask? It was that simple? <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, Jon. I&rsquo;d like that! Very much.&rdquo; Teeth finding her bottom lip, she bit down hard. The slight sting of pain told her that this was real. <br /><br />&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Now it was his turn to gawp. &ldquo;Well&hellip;. Okay. Cool! Umm&hellip; I&rsquo;ll come by and get you.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Dany queried breathlessly. Her heart galloped a tattoo so hard she thought it would explode out of the confines of her cage of ribs. She felt as if she could just float away. <br /><br />&ldquo;How about, this weekend. Sunday?&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Sure. That sounds lovely.&rdquo; A giddy giggle stole pass her drawn up lips. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; A matching grin transformed his lips into a beaming smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again real soon, Dany.&rdquo; <br /><br />With a little nod, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, Dany pushed her front door open. Turning back, she gave Jon a bashful wave before heading back inside, feeling suddenly invigorated. <br /><br />Waving back at her with a goofy smile, he watched wistfully as she disappeared through the throng of kids. If he weren&rsquo;t in public, Jon would have jumped up and did a happy victory jig. Instead, he resorted to sweeping his puppy up in a big hug and rocking him. It was all thanks to Ghost that his first meeting with Dany went so well. Oh, he should probably call his friend up too and give him his thanks for his sagely advice. But that can wait till later. Now, he had a date to plan. <br /><br />The work day passed by in a breeze. And if Missandei noticed the spring in her friend&rsquo;s step and the constant smile pushing at her cheeks, she sure didn&rsquo;t say anything. She&rsquo;d get the news out of Dany later. It would seem her best girl was well on her way to a new beginning. </p></p>",

I'm a JONSA(jon/sansa) shipper. I'm a firm supporter of \"SHIP AND LET SHIP\" and \"LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE\"\nI have no problem with people who ship them with others or who are multi shippers. But be warned that I post a lot of Jonsa content. O and I dislike Daenerys Targaryen(can't stand all the burning stuff up and the entitlement) So don't follow if you don't agree.\nMy OTHER favorite shows and otps are Jamestown, Merlin, Grimm, SilverMadi (BlackSails) Klayley (The Originals), Olicity (Arrow), Darvey (Suits) and Kennash(Reign, this ship broke my heart, my headcanon is that he is alive and ends up with her where ever she is)",
