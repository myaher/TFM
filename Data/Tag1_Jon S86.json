It is more than likely not what the song is about but i got inspired to write it like this when i heard it<b>.</b></p><p><i>Don\u2019t you know i\u2019m no good for you\u00a0</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ve learned to lose you can\u2019t afford to</i></p><p><i>Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding</i></p><p><i>But nothing ever stops you leaving</i></p><p>The quiet of the house was something she doesn\u2019t think she will ever get used to. Once a place filled with light and laughter is now blanketed in darkness and despair. The oasis she loved to live in, now an abyss of negative emotions she would rather live without. </p><p>Placing her keys in the bowl by the door and hanging her coat on the hook after a party was something that was not new to her. But doing it in the dark, all alone is not something she was accustomed to. The once annoying act of tripping over shoes left in the doorway is a burden she wishes she could bring back. Things that were once so big, and now so very absent, she wishes for nothing more than to have them return to her.</p><p>No TV in the background. No sound of running water from the bathroom. The only water running was the tears leaving her eyes and rolling down her cheeks. Turning on the lights and expecting his figure to be slumped asleep on the sofa, but only the dip in the cushions was what remained. Walking to the bedroom and wanting to see a trail of his clothes on the floor but wanting all she liked didn\u2019t make it come true. </p><p>Opening the wardrobe, she tossed her boots on top of the pile of shoes that have been left unorganised since she no longer shared the space. His things had been put into boxes and moved into the loft. The lack of his shirts and jumpers leaving a gaping hole in the right side of the wardrobe much like the hole left within her heart. Not even their dog was here anymore. Having to now live with his relatives due to her not being able to care for him as much as he used to. She doesn\u2019t think she will be able to care for herself either.</p><p>She was never good enough for him, she knew that, but he didn\u2019t care. A lost girl, found by a boy that was willing to help mend her from her messy past, and she couldn\u2019t even save him. </p><p>Sitting on the bed she squinted at the glare of her phone screen, staring at the picture that was before her. She was on his back, he was laughing like she had never seen anyone laugh before. A rolling field of green behind them. But now only rolling thunder and rain was her reality. The sun could shine, and the birds could sing, but that will never settle the storm of emotions that will live within her for as long as she was on this earth without him.</p><p>A vibration in her hand brought her out of her reverie. A message, but not from him, from her friend. Her best friend asking if she was okay. She replied yes, but she thought no, she would never be okay again. Is this what her life would become, an endless cycle of lies to quell the worry of others? Maybe that was for the best.</p><p>A screech from outside startled her. A car turning the corner too fast. Much like that day. The day he was taken from her, too fast. </p><p>-</p><p>Blue skies for miles and warm air swirled through the open widow next to her. Music from the radio was filling the car whilst they drove out of the city towards the coast. </p><p>It was a surprise weekend away she had gifted him a few weeks before his birthday. He was opposed to attention, even when it came to birthdays, so she thought surprising him before the day would make up for it. Celebrating thirty years on earth is a big deal she kept telling him, but he just laughed and returned back to whatever book he was lost reading this time. She went and booked it anyway. </p><p>He suspected something was up when she was out of bed earlier than normal, lunch was in Tupperware boxes on the kitchen side and she was smiling like a lunatic when he finally peeled himself out of the sheets of their bed.</p><p>She insisted on driving, she knew he knew what was happening, but she was grateful he played along. Out of the city the traffic had thinned out. They could finally make their way to the peaceful seaside cabin for a weekend of rest and relaxation that they both knew they needed. But it would never be.</p><p>The happiness lasted about fifteen minutes after getting out of the city. Fifteen short minutes before she heard the screech. A car going too fast down the country lane spun into them. The back of the car hitting the front of theirs. That\u2019s all she could remember before waking up in hospital later that day.</p><p>They had gotten him to the hospital, all with the hope that they could remove the glass from his chest and close his skull back up. The hope was short lived. He had lost too much blood and his body shutdown from the shock of the trauma. She wished she hadn\u2019t been so lucky.</p><p>-</p><p>She looked at her phone again, but this time at the numbers across the screen. Four zeros looking back at her, that soon turned into eight as the tears resurfaced and blurred her vision.</p><p>She stood and walked back through to the kitchen towards the fridge. She hadn\u2019t eaten much in the last three weeks. She didn\u2019t feel like filling herself up when her life would never be whole again. So, the only items in her fridge were bottles of alcohol and sad looking vegetables that were bought for her to encourage her to eat. She preferred the alcohol.</p><p>She took out the champagne that she was saving for this occasion. She was saving it for when they got back. But there was no they anymore, just she.</p><p>Popping the cork and letting the foam spill onto the tiled floor, she grabbed her phone off the counter and rang the number.</p><p>It rang and rang until she heard him. It was him but not who she wanted. A robotic version talking to her letting her know he will get back to her when he could. But that was never going to happen. He would never be able to get back to her. Not in this life anyway. </p><p>She chugged the champagne as one that was meant for two, while she listened to his voice. The beep sounded and now it was her turn to talk.</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Jon\u201d she choked out. She sank to her knees and leant against one of the kitchen cabinets and sobbed into the phone. \u201cI told you I would ring you when the party was over\u201d. She talked about the celebration of what would have been his thirtieth year on this earth until his answer phone was so full of stories, she thought he might hear one of them from the little flat they used to call home.</p>",

But it would never be.</p><p>The happiness lasted about fifteen minutes after getting out of the city. Fifteen short minutes before she heard the screech. A car going too fast down the country lane spun into them. The back of the car hitting the front of theirs. That&rsquo;s all she could remember before waking up in hospital later that day.</p><p>They had gotten him to the hospital, all with the hope that they could remove the glass from his chest and close his skull back up. The hope was short lived. He had lost too much blood and his body shutdown from the shock of the trauma. She wished she hadn&rsquo;t been so lucky.</p><p>-</p><p>She looked at her phone again, but this time at the numbers across the screen. Four zeros looking back at her, that soon turned into eight as the tears resurfaced and blurred her vision.</p><p>She stood and walked back through to the kitchen towards the fridge. She hadn&rsquo;t eaten much in the last three weeks. She didn&rsquo;t feel like filling herself up when her life would never be whole again. So, the only items in her fridge were bottles of alcohol and sad looking vegetables that were bought for her to encourage her to eat. She preferred the alcohol.</p><p>She took out the champagne that she was saving for this occasion. She was saving it for when they got back. But there was no they anymore, just she.</p><p>Popping the cork and letting the foam spill onto the tiled floor, she grabbed her phone off the counter and rang the number.</p><p>It rang and rang until she heard him. It was him but not who she wanted. A robotic version talking to her letting her know he will get back to her when he could. But that was never going to happen. He would never be able to get back to her. Not in this life anyway. </p><p>She chugged the champagne as one that was meant for two, while she listened to his voice. The beep sounded and now it was her turn to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Happy Birthday, Jon&rdquo; she choked out. She sank to her knees and leant against one of the kitchen cabinets and sobbed into the phone. &ldquo;I told you I would ring you when the party was over&rdquo;. She talked about the celebration of what would have been his thirtieth year on this earth until his answer phone was so full of stories, she thought he might hear one of them from the little flat they used to call home.</p></p>",
