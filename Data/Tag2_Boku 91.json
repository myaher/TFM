In the past, non-green students would apply as ringless to general studies and transfer to heroics class, but this is the first year UA allowed non-green students.<br /></p><p><b>Green rings represent strong will, and the ability to overcome fear</b>, perfect for the hero profession.</p><p><b>Blue rings represent the ability to instill hope in others</b>, while those with <b>Indigo rings show great compassion</b>. Both of these rings tend to be worn by rescue heroes.</p><p><b>Violet rings are for those who feel great love</b>, towards themselves or other people.</p><p><b>Yellow rings represent fear</b>, both the ability to instill fear, as well as those who give in to their fear, and let it control them. <b>Red rings represent rage</b> and are worn by those who feel the rage and will let it control them. Both of these rings are worn by villains more than heroes, but that isn&rsquo;t always the case. </p><p><b>Orange rings are worn by the greedy</b>, and there is only one orange ring in this world.</p><p><b>Black rings represent death</b>. Only those who are near death or cause a lot of death wear them. A ring made for true supervillains or people in great peril.</p><p>\n\n<b>White rings are the most powerful, able to harness the entire emotional spectrum </b>and comprising of all the colors.&nbsp;</p><p>There are only 2 white rings in this world, one is wielded by All-for-One. The other white ring was special. It had the ability to be transferred from one person to another. All Might is the current holder but had begun to process to transfer his power to Izuku. The One-for-All ring had the ability to duplicate itself, but it doesn&rsquo;t last. Once the new host gains the ring, the old host loses access to the power battery and only has a limited charge. When not in use, All-Might&rsquo;s ring turns black. At times the white ring can be too powerful for Izuku, and if he isn&rsquo;t careful, his ring will burn him where it touches.\n\n<br /></p><p><b></b></p><p>All-for-One&rsquo;s ring is different. His power battery is powered by the broken rings of his defeated foes, and he can use his own ring to fuse the remnants back together and implant them into his Nomus. </p><p><b></b></p><p>Despite being the current wielder of the orange ring, Endeavor wasn&rsquo;t always orange. His ring used to be green, but after the death of his mentor, he tried to take his mentor&rsquo;s ring. Dead men don&rsquo;t need their rings. After that, his color changed. While he can focus enough to pass off as a green lantern, his constructs and ring stay orange, showing his true greed, not that anyone can tell. </p><p><b></b></p><p>In his quest for power, Endeavor tried to make his own son an orange lantern. When Todoroki got his ring, much to the horror of those around him, the ring was a bright yellow. Fear had taken over Shouto&rsquo;s heart. Endeavor stole the ring away behind vaults of lead and crystal, forcing Todoroki to use the blue ring his mother once wore, turning the once brilliant cerulean light a deep, depressing green.
