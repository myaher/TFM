I was told that Jonerys do have forshadowing right in the aGoT about them hooking up and we all saw that in the show,. but that doesn't mean endgame and true love. We all saw what \"epic romance\" it was. I think that in the books it's very blatant clues, when with J/S it is very subbtle.",

She is the person who is foremost on his conscious mind and in a less complex book this might be used to point towards a romantic relation in the end. I must admit that I never got these romantic vibes, but I know of J0nrya shippers who do. To me Jon/Arya is a mirror of Ned/Lyanna. Ned thinks very often about Lyanna and still mourns her but his romantic interest is very clearly Cat. He doesn&rsquo;t think that often about Cat but if he does it is extremely important and heartbreaking. So I would say that this is a hint that Jon/Sansa might be more important than is visible at first sight. So Arya is like a constant companion in Jon&rsquo;s thoughts. He is connected to her as if they are linked. It is the most obvious of Jon&rsquo; s relationships on the surface and that might hide something else.</p><p>Then there is Jon\u20acrys and the seemingly &lsquo;parallel&rsquo; learning arcs. Or rather not parallels but two lines who seem to converge. By the second book many people suspected that they would meet eventually (and become lovers). The trick here is that this lines we expect to meet in the future is the second layer that leads the reader by the nose. Because Jon and Da\u20acnerys are not parallels, but foils. The easiest way to explain this is actually the end of the first book. Yes, they both learned in the first book, but by the end of AGOT Da\u20acnerys has followers, Jon has friends. And while the line of their arcs certainly are set up to converge, this does not bode well for love. Two antagonists also have arcs that converge! And GRRM deceives us about that by using romantic imagery like flower, sweet, dance, song&hellip; But these are camouflage for the fight that comes!</p><p>Then there is Jonsa. While Jon and Arya share a link and Jon and Da\u20acnerys have converging lines, Jon and Sansa are like a puzzle. The further along we get in the books, the more puzzle pieces we get, until there is a moment where even the last reader will probably realise that together Jon and Sansa are like a puzzle that perfectly fits together. It is done subtly and you have to look for the missing pieces, it is no explicit link nor is it a clear line. Together they make the puzzle fit and you don&rsquo;t necessarily see it, before you look for it.</p><p>In the first book there are little pieces of the puzzle, like Ned telling Sansa that she&rsquo;ll marry someone 'brave, gentle and strong&rsquo;, but there are also some similarities in Jon&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s arc that we tend to overlook because the masculine world at the wall is so different from Sansa&rsquo;s feminine courtly experience. Both have very romantic and idealistic expectations, both complain that life is not fair (and within chapters of each other). But most importantly both meet foils of the other. For Sansa these are Joffrey and the Hound - who are both the opposite of what Sansa really wants in a man, but she doesn&rsquo;t know that yet, for Jon this is Sam - Sam who sings, who needs protection and yet is clever and compassionate. Sam is in a way a male version of Sansa, the fact that he sings points to the very important subject of Jon and people who sing (compare my meta on 'singers singing songs&rsquo;). Sam shows the reader that Jon indeed values more than traditional male virtues. Jon meets Ygritte as a foil for Sansa only later, while Sansa keeps meeting men who ultimately are all found wanting. I suspect that a female Version of Jon might be Mya Stone in the Vale, like Sam is a foil for Sansa.</p><p>So, I would say that there is not much explicit foreshadowing (as far as foreshadowing can be explicit) in the first book apart from 'radiant&rsquo; and 'brave, gentle and strong&rsquo;, but GRRM already put some of his puzzle pieces in place. They only make sense if you step back and look at what might be the bigger picture, and book for book GRRM adds more puzzle pieces. But there are enough pieces in the first book for me to be confident in my opinion that GRRM planned for Jonsa from the start. </p><p>The thing about these puzzle pieces is that you only see them if you are open to the possibility. If you don&rsquo;t believe in Jonsa you can probably deny their existence up to the very end. And I think that this is one of the reasons why it is difficult to decipher Jonsa and why Antis are so adamant that it is not there.</p><p>I mean take Sam for example : being a hint to Jon actually liking singers and a foil for Sansa is after all far from being the only purpose Sam has for the tale. He fulfills many other functions as do the other persons who give us parts of the puzzle. That is why it is so easy zo dismiss it and declare it as delusions of Jonsa shippers. It will fall into place once Jonsa becomes obvious, but it is so much easier to see the link to Arya and the convergence of Da\u20acnerys&rsquo; and Jon &rsquo;s arc that it does not seem necessary to look further. But if you do, it is all there and I for my part can never go back to my former self who did not see this. I cannot unsee the Jonsa puzzle pieces and they have provided me with a much deeper understanding for the complexity of ASOIAF and a key to unlock other puzzles as well. And AGOT has many of the first pieces that contribute to a picture that grows in the telling.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

She is the person who is foremost on his conscious mind and in a less complex book this might be used to point towards a romantic relation in the end. I must admit that I never got these romantic vibes, but I know of J0nrya shippers who do. To me Jon/Arya is a mirror of Ned/Lyanna. Ned thinks very often about Lyanna and still mourns her but his romantic interest is very clearly Cat. He doesn&rsquo;t think that often about Cat but if he does it is extremely important and heartbreaking. So I would say that this is a hint that Jon/Sansa might be more important than is visible at first sight. So Arya is like a constant companion in Jon&rsquo;s thoughts. He is connected to her as if they are linked. It is the most obvious of Jon&rsquo; s relationships on the surface and that might hide something else.</p><p>Then there is Jon&euro;rys and the seemingly &lsquo;parallel&rsquo; learning arcs. Or rather not parallels but two lines who seem to converge. By the second book many people suspected that they would meet eventually (and become lovers). The trick here is that this lines we expect to meet in the future is the second layer that leads the reader by the nose. Because Jon and Da&euro;nerys are not parallels, but foils. The easiest way to explain this is actually the end of the first book. Yes, they both learned in the first book, but by the end of AGOT Da&euro;nerys has followers, Jon has friends. And while the line of their arcs certainly are set up to converge, this does not bode well for love. Two antagonists also have arcs that converge! And GRRM deceives us about that by using romantic imagery like flower, sweet, dance, song&hellip; But these are camouflage for the fight that comes!</p><p>Then there is Jonsa. While Jon and Arya share a link and Jon and Da&euro;nerys have converging lines, Jon and Sansa are like a puzzle. The further along we get in the books, the more puzzle pieces we get, until there is a moment where even the last reader will probably realise that together Jon and Sansa are like a puzzle that perfectly fits together. It is done subtly and you have to look for the missing pieces, it is no explicit link nor is it a clear line. Together they make the puzzle fit and you don&rsquo;t necessarily see it, before you look for it.</p><p>In the first book there are little pieces of the puzzle, like Ned telling Sansa that she&rsquo;ll marry someone 'brave, gentle and strong&rsquo;, but there are also some similarities in Jon&rsquo;s and Sansa&rsquo;s arc that we tend to overlook because the masculine world at the wall is so different from Sansa&rsquo;s feminine courtly experience. Both have very romantic and idealistic expectations, both complain that life is not fair (and within chapters of each other). But most importantly both meet foils of the other. For Sansa these are Joffrey and the Hound - who are both the opposite of what Sansa really wants in a man, but she doesn&rsquo;t know that yet, for Jon this is Sam - Sam who sings, who needs protection and yet is clever and compassionate. Sam is in a way a male version of Sansa, the fact that he sings points to the very important subject of Jon and people who sing (compare my meta on 'singers singing songs&rsquo;). Sam shows the reader that Jon indeed values more than traditional male virtues. Jon meets Ygritte as a foil for Sansa only later, while Sansa keeps meeting men who ultimately are all found wanting. I suspect that a female Version of Jon might be Mya Stone in the Vale, like Sam is a foil for Sansa.</p><p>So, I would say that there is not much explicit foreshadowing (as far as foreshadowing can be explicit) in the first book apart from 'radiant&rsquo; and 'brave, gentle and strong&rsquo;, but GRRM already put some of his puzzle pieces in place. They only make sense if you step back and look at what might be the bigger picture, and book for book GRRM adds more puzzle pieces. But there are enough pieces in the first book for me to be confident in my opinion that GRRM planned for Jonsa from the start. </p><p>The thing about these puzzle pieces is that you only see them if you are open to the possibility. If you don&rsquo;t believe in Jonsa you can probably deny their existence up to the very end. And I think that this is one of the reasons why it is difficult to decipher Jonsa and why Antis are so adamant that it is not there.</p><p>I mean take Sam for example : being a hint to Jon actually liking singers and a foil for Sansa is after all far from being the only purpose Sam has for the tale. He fulfills many other functions as do the other persons who give us parts of the puzzle. That is why it is so easy zo dismiss it and declare it as delusions of Jonsa shippers. It will fall into place once Jonsa becomes obvious, but it is so much easier to see the link to Arya and the convergence of Da&euro;nerys&rsquo; and Jon &rsquo;s arc that it does not seem necessary to look further. But if you do, it is all there and I for my part can never go back to my former self who did not see this. I cannot unsee the Jonsa puzzle pieces and they have provided me with a much deeper understanding for the complexity of ASOIAF and a key to unlock other puzzles as well. And AGOT has many of the first pieces that contribute to a picture that grows in the telling.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

Enjoy SanSan fans.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn\u2019t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn\u2019t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn\u2019t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn\u2019t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>\u201cHang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.\u201d Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but&hellip;\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa&rsquo;s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922&hellip;</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience.

Enjoy SanSan fans.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>SanSan - Gangster AU</p><p>Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?</p><p>Sandor stood guard\nover the door to make sure <i>his dame</i> wouldn\u2019t be disturbed\nbefore the show, wearing his zoot suit and hat tipped in such a way\nthat it would cover all the scaring on the right side of his face but\nnot low enough that it would interfere with his vision in any way,\nbefore the stage director came and told him that he only had a few\nminutes before Miss Sansa would be expected to perform. \n</p><p>Sandor nodded and\nknocked his unique knock on the door that relayed that message\nwithout him ever having to say anything and only a minute later Sansa\ncame out, all dolled up and looking particularly beautiful before he\nwalked her to the side wing of the stage before he noticed a bruise\non her back she didn\u2019t quite cover up, it was in a bad spot she\nprobably couldn\u2019t quite reach and she was trying to cover it with\nher fur shall but it wasn\u2019t working, since it only seemed to cover\nhalf of it. \n</p><p>\u201cHang on Little\nBird, you missed a spot.\u201d Sandor noted as he pulled a small box of\nspecial makeup powder and the poof from his pocket just for this\npurpose as she stood still and let him brush and poof on the powder\nto cover the bruise and his jaw clenched and he huffed through his\nnose for the thousandth time. He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa\u2019s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922\u2026</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSandor.\u201d Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn\u2019t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn\u2019t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He\u2019d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he\u2019d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn\u2019t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone\u2019s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa\u2019s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa\u2019s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

He hated this. He was hired to protect\nher but he was somewhat powerless to protect her from Joffrey, the mob boss who hired him and who had been the only real threat to her\nsafety. \n</p><p>He delicately moved\nthe back of her dress over so that the powder wouldn\u2019t get on it\nand after a moment of trying to cover the bruise and turned the dark\npurple bruise to a barely dark shadow, he realized that that was the\nbest that powder could do and left it alone and moved her dress back.\nSansa, once she realized he was done, said a small but grateful word\nof \u2018thanks\u2019 and kept walking towards the stage where she took a\ndeep breath to calm her nerves. \n</p><p>\u201cI could keep you\nsafe,\u201d Sandor rasped in her ear as they stood in the wing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nall afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I\u2019d kill them.\u201d\nSandor offered so softly in her ear behind her that only Sansa would\nhear him. \n</p><p>\u201cNo one can truly protect me, no one can protect anyone, not from him. I know you\ndo all you can but\u2026\u201d Sansa whispered back over her shoulder as\nshe slid her mask away so to speak to give him a true look that broke\nhis heart more than her bruises did. He was the one person she\nallowed to see her without her \u2018mask\u2019 anymore because he was the\none person who had proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that she was\nsafe to be herself with, a luxury that she had no idea would be as\nprecious as it was. \n</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach\neverywhere Little Bird, there are cities big enough and depths deep\nenough that I could take you to where no one would find us.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>\u201cWhere would that\nbe?\u201d Sansa asked, her tone disbelieving but almost hopeful. \n</p><p>\u201cChicago or New\nYork for starters, besides it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\ngets what\u2019s coming to him.\u201d Sandor immediately answered, a ghost\nof a grin on his lips. \n</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Sansa\nsuddenly asked as she caught a glimpse of Joffery with his gang in\nthe audience at the best table. That tramp Margaery on one of his\narms and laughing at nearly everything he said. \n</p><p>\u201cTonight, I\u2019ll\neven pack while you sing.\u201d Sandor offered as his heart almost began\nto soar. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, with you\nbeing gone from your post, they\u2019d know something was up.\u201d Sansa\nreasoned and Sandor knew she was right, that was just wishful\nthinking on his part. \n</p><p>\u201cWe could leave in\nthe middle of the night then, just pack what you absolutely can not\nlive without.\u201d Sandor pleaded. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat about my\npay?\u201d Sansa asked. \n</p><p>\u201cWhat pay? Like I\nsaid, he doesn\u2019t really put it in the bank, he blows it, there is\nnone Little Bird, that\u2019s just how he keeps you here in this god\nforsaken cage.\u201d Sandor insisted and Sansa knew he was probably\ntelling the truth. She hadn\u2019t wanted to believe him the first time he told her that but the more time went on, the more she believed that claim.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat about Arya?\nWhat about Lady?\u201d Sansa asked, knowing Sandor had been keeping Arya safely hidden, disguised as a boy in his apartment nearby. \n</p><p>\u201cThey can come\ntoo, I know Arya wouldn\u2019t leave without Nymeria anyway.\u201d Sandor\npromised. \n</p><p>Then Sansa took a\nmoment to think it over before she gave him the nod and a smirking\nsmile. <i>She was in</i> and Sandor wanted to kiss her and run away\nthat instant but he had to bide his time and Sansa\u2019s mask slid back\ninto place and she strutted out to the middle of the stage behind the\ncurtain and became the canary she was. \n</p><p>\u201c<i>You had plenty\nmoney 1922\u2026</i>\u201d Sansa began to sing sensually as she lifted her\nleg to spread the curtains before they were pulled apart to reveal\nher as the crowd cheered and Sandor watched, still mesmerized by her\nfor a moment before he remembered his job and had to map out the\nplace, realize who was who in the crowd from his vantage point as he\nmoved both of his hands to rest on the handles of his enforcers, just\nin case- as he realized all he really needed was his tommy guns, he\ncould strong arm the rest to take care of her. \n</p><p>Sansa finished her\nset and came out and socialized with the crowd, as was her job,\nbefore she sat with Joffrey and Margaery, putting on a smile and\nacted like nothing was the matter at all and once she was there,\nSandor moved and went to get his tommy guns from the back, where\neveryone kept their guns when not in use, this club was a front for\nJoffrey\u2019s mob after all. \n</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doin?\u201d\nThe lieutenant in charge of the guns asked Sandor curiously as Sandor\narmed himself even more than he already was. \u00a0\n</p><p>\u201cI got a bad\nfeeling, but don\u2019t say nothin to the boss, don\u2019t want to spoil\nhis evening or his mood.\u201d Sandor answered nonchalantly as he loaded\nthem and slung them around his shoulders so that they laid against\nhis sides and put on a trench coat to cover it all before he came\nback out and stood guard over <i>his dame</i> again as he mentally\nfantasized about just opening fire on his boss and all those at the\ntable with them once Sansa would leave the table to go back into her\ncage, but he did not, but the fantasy did put the smallest of smirks\non his lips. \n</p><p>When Sansa was\ndismissed, she quickly packed her suitcase with everything she held\nmost dear and then hid it under her bed, just in case Joffrey came\nback to say good night as she lazily took off all her makeup and did\nher hair up in pin curls and put on her cold creams and such and\nsimply dressed in her night gown and a robe to make it look like she was getting ready for bed just like any other night. Her instincts were\nright, Sandor knocked another special knock on her door to let her\nknow her tormentor was coming and she prepared herself and only a\nmoment later he came into her bedroom/ dressing room/ prison cell. \n</p><p>\u201cYou howled ok\ntonight,\u201d Joffrey noted, in his back handed way of complimenting her. \n</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she\nthanked him, hoping he wouldn\u2019t get wind of anything. \n</p><p>\u201cSo do you want\nyour pay in cash tonight Doll?\u201d He asked as he tilted his head and\nSansa knew a trick when she saw one as he reached into his pocket and\npulled a thousand dollars in a money clip out of his pocket, a year\u2019s\npay and Sansa felt sick seeing it all. \n</p><p>\u201cNo, put it in the\nbank- as always.\u201d Sansa waived off, knowing if she answered any\ndifferently that he\u2019d flip a switch and was liable to kill her if\nhe suspected she was leaving. Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart broad.\u201d\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. \u201cMy\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.\u201d\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the \u2018jewelry\u2019 that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>\u201cI think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don\u2019t you go get it\nout and make sure?\u201d He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>\u201cThe ruby one?\u201d\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn\u2019t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>\u201cI thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.\u201d Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>\u201cIf someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I\u2019d wear it with this dress.\u201d Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>\u201cYou got it Doll.\u201d\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI could take my\npay though boss,\u201d Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. \u201cWhy are you choppered up?\u201d He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>\u201cHad a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn\u2019t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.\u201d Sandor explained. \n</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.\u201d \u00a0He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa\u2019s room. \n</p><p>\u201cYou did great\nLittle Bird.\u201d Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSoon Little Bird,\nyou\u2019ll be able to fly free.\u201d Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey\u2019s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn\u2019t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary\u2019s wings so short she couldn\u2019t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. \u00a0\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.\u201d\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband\u2019s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>\u201cWell then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.\u201d Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>\u201cAt least two.\u201d\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.\u201d Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll\nhowl back Hound.\u201d Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn\u2019t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSandor.\u201d Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn\u2019t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn\u2019t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He\u2019d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he\u2019d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>\u201cSansa,\u201d Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn\u2019t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone\u2019s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa\u2019s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa\u2019s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

Even though a thousand dollars would be\nperfectly handy right about now. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Smart broad.&rdquo;\nHe nodded in agreement as he put it away into his pocket again. &ldquo;My\nma will be coming to the club tomorrow night, wear this for her.&rdquo;\nHe commanded as he reached out of the room to grab the gown Sandor\nhad been holding for him and Sansa realized that nothing of the cheap\npaste that was the &lsquo;jewelry&rsquo; that he gave her to wear on stage\nwould really match it. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I think the\nnecklace your mother had would match it, why don&rsquo;t you go get it\nout and make sure?&rdquo; He prodded and Sansa did remarkably well by not\nbatting an eye or reacting in anyway when she realized that that\nnecklace was in her suitcase under the bed and she had to think fast\nof an excuse not to do as she was told. \n</p><p>&ldquo;The ruby one?&rdquo;\nSansa asked before he nodded in agreement but his face clearly showed\nhe was getting impatient with her that she wasn&rsquo;t obeying him\nimmediately. \n</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you\ntook that with the sapphire one and the emerald one when you told me\nto keep them at the bank, they were safer in that deposit box than\nwith me.&rdquo; Sansa answered calmly as a small frown of confusion\ncrossed his face as he tried to recall who he had sold those to, that\nwas several drunken bouts ago and his memory was fuzzy. \n</p><p>&ldquo;If someone,\nprobably <i>that hound</i> could go to the bank for me in the morning\nto retrieve it, I&rsquo;d wear it with this dress.&rdquo; Sansa affirmed as\nshe made a show of loving this red glittering dress while referencing\nher secret lover with the same impudence Joffrey usually had when he\nbarked orders around to everyone that always seemed to make him grin,\nthinking he had succeeded into taking a beautiful, sweet canary and\nturning it into an ugly vulture. \n</p><p>&ldquo;You got it Doll.&rdquo;\nHe nodded and hung the dress up in her closet with her others before\nhe bid her goodnight and left before he shut and locked her door, giving Sandor back the key.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I could take my\npay though boss,&rdquo; Sandor offered since he had overheard everything\nfrom the doorway. \n</p><p>Joffrey grumbled\nsomething under his breath as he pulled a hundred out of his pocket\nand handed it over. &ldquo;Why are you choppered up?&rdquo; He asked as\nhe noticed how Sandor was still wearing the tommy guns under his trench coat. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Had a bad feeling\ntonight Boss, turned out to be nothin but didn&rsquo;t want to ruin your\nmood by tellin ya and figured it was better to be safe that sorry by\nwearin them to make sure no one tried anything.&rdquo; Sandor explained. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Smart thinking,\ngo to the <i>bank</i> tomorrow for her ruby necklace, use em if you\nhave to.&rdquo; &nbsp;He ordered as he nodded to the tommy guns and Sandor\nnodded in understanding before Joffrey finally left, swaggering away\nas Sandor could practically feel Sansa exhale in relief from behind\nthe door. \n</p><p>Sandor waited\nanother full hour before he finally knocked his favorite secret knock\nand smiled when Sansa replied by knocking her own favorite knock back that meant she was ready and wanted him to come in and Sandor unlocked the door slipped into Sansa&rsquo;s room. \n</p><p>&ldquo;You did great\nLittle Bird.&rdquo; Sandor praised as he kept an ear towards the door as\nhe carefully peeled off his trench coat and tommy guns and hung them on a hook\nbehind the door, Sansa was just about to get changed into other\nclothes before she flung her arms around his neck and shoulders as he\nheld her tight and kissed her the way he had wanted to earlier and was so happy when she kissed back just as passionately.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Soon Little Bird,\nyou&rsquo;ll be able to fly free.&rdquo; Sandor whispered between heated\nkisses as he walked her over to her bed as she suddenly jumped up to\nwrap her legs around his waist as his hold moved to under her ass and\nsqueezed it as he suddenly found himself tenting the pants of his\nsuit as he very gently laid her down.</p><p>He was the only man\nto ever physically be gentle and reverent with her. At first he had\nbeen a bit rough in talking with her because he saw how tenderhearted\nshe was and he knew that she needed to toughen up or be swallowed\nalive and once he managed to explain that to her, she seemed to try\nharder and grow thicker skin so to speak. But once Sandor realized he\nwas falling in love with her, he knew he was done for. Because she\nwas still kind and sweet underneath her mask, especially to him,\ndespite everything and Sandor realized how strong she was for staying\nthat way. And Sandor proved to her that she was safe with him. He\nprotected her the best he could, he protected her from everyone,\nexcept Joffrey and even then, he did all he could to try and curb\nJoffrey&rsquo;s temper when it seemed to get unleashed on her, reminding\nJoffrey that he couldn&rsquo;t beat her black and blue, not when she was\nexpected to perform and that no makeup in the world could cover up\nthe harm he wanted to cause her and how Joffrey would loose money and\npopularity if he clipped his canary&rsquo;s wings so short she couldn&rsquo;t\nsing for him, <i>for anyone</i> and that seemed to be the only thing that\nkept Joffrey at bay, but he still struck her bad enough in a spot she\ncould easily cover up to get out his rage since he was loosing money\nfaster than he was making it, even though he had the city in a\nstrangle hold as it was and was currently bleeding it dry. &nbsp;\n</p><p>But during the\nnights like this, Sandor allowed himself to come into her cage with\nher and she would sing for him a song she reserved only for him and\nit was sweeter than any music ever could be. \n</p><p>&ldquo;How much longer?&rdquo;\nSansa asked in a hushed whisper as she took his hat off and set it\ndown on the bedside table before she kissed his scars tenderly, the\nonly woman to ever do so. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Only a few hours,\nmake sure everyone is asleep, before the bakers awake though.&rdquo;\nSandor breathed into her skin as his course hands threatened to snag\nthe delicate satin of her nightgown as he gathered it up to her waist\nas she undid the high waistband&rsquo;s button and unzipped his zipper of\nhis trousers and un-clipped the suspenders from his waist band to get\nhis pants down before he finally put a rubber on to protect her from\ngetting pregnant and sheathed himself to the hilt in her, drinking\ndown her keening moan in a deep kiss. He did have the largest cock in\nthe whole mob and it was the only one Sansa enjoyed riding and\nenjoyed getting fucked into oblivion with. Of course who it belonged\nto made all the difference too. Sandor actually loved her and never\nhurt her, especially like this or in this way, it had taken Sandor\nover the course of a couple of months of gentle caresses and really\nbeing kind, gentle and patient with her before she enjoyed his touch the way she was\nmeant to before she outright asked for it and physically put his\nhands on her so she would feel loved instead of hated. And finally\nafter their first time together, it was like this sweet innocent who\nonly played a vixen on stage fully came into her own and they fucked\nevery chance they got, but of course it had to be in secret or else\nJoffrey would send them both to swim with the fishes or put them on\nice. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Well then we\ndefinitely have time for <i>at least</i> one more romp.&rdquo; Sansa\nbeamed cheekily as she locked her ankles behind the small of his back\nto keep him in place. \n</p><p>&ldquo;At least two.&rdquo;\nSandor rumbled as his hips snapped into hers and he powered a good\nstroke into her, making her eyes fall shut and the most amazing\nkeening moan spill from her throat as her hands went underneath his\njacket to claw at his back over his dress shirt. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to\nsing for me Little Bird.&rdquo; Sandor grunted into her ear. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Only if you&rsquo;ll\nhowl back Hound.&rdquo; Sansa purred into his ear before he pulled her\nbreasts from her the top of her night gown to suckle at them and tease her nipples by\nnipping at them, not painfully but enough to really light her on fire\nso to speak as she hissed and gasped in sex hazed delight as his hips\nsped up, trying to get Sansa to her release before he came to his.\nThe one thing he could always give her that didn&rsquo;t cost him\nanything but time, effort and patience. But those he would always gladly spend on her anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sandor.&rdquo; Sansa\nwhimpered as her face flashed pain but she wasn&rsquo;t suffering, far\nfrom it- as she wrapped her arms under his suit jacket and held him\nclose, loving the fiery furnace he always seemed to be, she would\nnever go cold at night ever again. Because after tonight, he wouldn&rsquo;t\nbe leaving her bed at night. He&rsquo;d actually be able to sleep with\nher without worry- especially about if whether or not Joffrey and his\nthugs were coming and he&rsquo;d actually take all of his clothes off for\nonce, instead of only shoving his pants down so he could get\nredressed within a quick second if need be, something that had saved\nthem both on several occasions. \n</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa,&rdquo; Sandor\nwhispered back, one of the few times he didn&rsquo;t use his affectionate\nnick name for her before she finally sang as much as she could\nwithout getting anyone&rsquo;s attention as she found her release, her\nwhole body tensing as her inner walls fluttered and constricted\naround his hardened length, even through the thick rubber condom that\nhe could feel her as he finally slammed into her, grinding out his\nown release as he grunted and growled into her own ear as he nipped\nat her ear lobe playfully as she finally laxed as they both breathed\nheavily as they basked in the afterglow and recovered. \n</p><p>Sandor and Sansa\nmade love one more time as they waited until a quarter to three in\nthe morning, to make sure everyone was asleep before they slipped\naway into the night and drove to New York, Lady in Sansa&rsquo;s lap in\nthe front seat and Arya stretched out in the backseat, Nymeria in her\nlap as she was wearing her own zoot suit with matching hat and had\nher own tommy gun next to her, ready to shoot whoever would be\nfollowing them. Sandor held onto Sansa&rsquo;s hand, kissing it softly\nand reverently from time to time as he drove them to the safety of\nthe biggest apple of all as all three of them, Sansa especially,\nfinally smiling genuinely for once. \n</p></p>",

He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She&rsquo;d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous &hellip; but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the <b>red</b>-<b>haired</b> girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, <b>Dunk shook his head and walked away</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I find this scene with the whore very interesting as I think it might have been the inspiration for Dan and Dave\u2019s creation of Roz on the show. \u00a0And like Jon did with Roz, Dunk, rejects the red-haired whore. \u00a0</p><p>However, like Jon with Ygritte, we later see that Dunk definitely has a thing for redheads when he encounters Rohanne Weber in <i>The Sworn Sword</i>. \u00a0We will talk a little bit more about both Rohanne and Ygritte later in the essay but for now, I just want to discuss the similarities in their description to each other as well as to the red-hair whore that Dunk sees.</p><!-- more --><blockquote><p>&ldquo;And what is all this merriment?&rdquo; The voice cut through the laughter, cool and firm. &ldquo;Will no one share the jape? Ser knight, why are you troubling my good-sister?&rdquo;</p><p>It was the girl he had seen earlier at the archery butts. She had a quiver of arrows on one hip, and held a longbow that was just as tall as she was, which wasn&rsquo;t very tall. <b>If Dunk was shy an inch of seven feet, the archer was shy an inch of five</b>. He could have spanned her waist with his two hands. <b>Her red hair was bound up in a braid so long it brushed past her thighs, and she had a dimpled chin, a snub nose, and a light spray of freckles across her cheeks</b>.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Forgive us, Lady Rohanne</b>.&rdquo; The speaker was a pretty young lord with the Caswell centaur embroidered on his doublet. &ldquo;This great oaf took the Lady Helicent for you.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>And here are a couple of descriptions of Ygritte. \u00a0Make note of the similarities between the three and keep in mind that like Lady Rohanne, Ygritte was also an archer.</p><blockquote><p>Ygritte watched and said nothing. She was older than he&rsquo;d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, <b>but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose. Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions.</b> She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather. Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon VI</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo; <b>Her breasts bounced</b> as she stood on one leg to pull one boot, then hopped onto her other foot to attend to the other. Her nipples were wide pink circles. &ldquo;You as well,&rdquo; Ygritte said as she yanked down her sheepskin breeches. &ldquo;If you want to look you have to show. You know nothing, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>All three women are of course redheads. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure of the importance of the bouncy breasts\u2026maybe just George remembering someone in his personal life. \u00a0Who knows! \u00a0Ygritte and the redhead whore are the ones described as having bouncy breast\u2014not Rohanne. \u00a0In fact, as we see from this Dunk dream sequence, Rohanne\u2019s breasts were most likely pretty small.</p><blockquote><p>Drowsing at long last, Dunk dreamed. He was running through a glade in the heart of Wat&rsquo;s Wood, running toward Rohanne, and she was shooting arrows at him. Each shaft she loosed flew true, and pierced him through the chest, yet the pain was strangely sweet. He should have turned and fled, but he ran toward her instead, running slowly as you always did in dreams, as if the very air had turned to honey. Another arrow came, and yet another. Her quiver seemed to have no end of shafts. Her eyes were gray and green and full of mischief. Your gown brings out the color of your eyes, he meant to say to her, but she was not wearing any gown, or any clothes at all. <b>Across her small breasts was a faint spray of freckles, and her nipples were red and hard as little berries.</b> The arrows made him look like some great porcupine as he went stumbling to her feet, but somehow he still found the strength to grab her braid.</p><p>With one hard yank he pulled her down on top of him and kissed her.</p><p>He woke suddenly, at the sound of a shout.</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>Rohanne and Ygritte are also described as short and while the height of the whore walking through the crowds is not given, it is not a ridiculous assumption to assume that she was as well. \u00a0Dunk was almost 7 feet and so he would have no problem seeing a shorter person in a crowd. \u00a0I think the most important things to note about them are their height, red hair, freckles on their faces and archery skills of two of the three.</p><p>There is another redhead in the books whose description is intriguingly similar to these three women. \u00a0And like the redhead Dunk saw at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, she is also a whore.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Is milord feeling unloved?&rdquo; Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. &ldquo;I have a cure for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. &ldquo;You are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I&rsquo;ve grown fond of Alayaya&rsquo;s remedy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but &lsquo;Yaya. She&rsquo;s good but I&rsquo;m better, don&rsquo;t you want to see?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next time, perhaps.&rdquo; Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. <b>She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist</b>. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Dancy\u2019s height is not given but based on how she is described as sitting on Tyrion\u2019s lap, one can probably deduce that she is not too tall or else Tyrion\u2019s mental thoughts would have filled us in. \u00a0Again we get the bouncy reference but I am not even going to attempt to analyze GRRM\u2019s psyche or why he describes the whores and Ygritte, a Wilding girl in this manner but Lady Rohanne as having the more refined small breast.</p><p>There is also another redheaded whore that I want to point out. \u00a0This one appears in the scene when Arya hears the summoning bells that lead her to seeing her father beheaded. \u00a0While George does not use the word bouncy, you can see from the description of her breast that he is following the same theme.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bells again, gods ha'mercy,&rdquo; wailed an old woman.</p><p><b>A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window</b>. &ldquo;Is it the boy king that&rsquo;s died now?&rdquo; she shouted down, leaning out over the street. &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a boy for you, they never last long.&rdquo; As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.</p><p>&ldquo;Stupid slut,&rdquo; the fat man shouted up. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s not dead, that&rsquo;s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Arya V </b> </p></blockquote><p>George wants us to think of Dunk as the symbolic Florian. \u00a0He even goes so far to have him and Tanselle role play a scene from the song of Florian and Jonquil to push the point home. \u00a0Dunk also plays Florian in his travels throughout the land as a hedge knight and so we must look to the women he encounters for clues of Jonquil. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You must think me an utter fool.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled. &ldquo;All men are fools, and all men are knights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What color paint do you have?&rdquo; he asked, hoping that might give him an idea.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight </b></p></blockquote><p>If we take the descriptions of Lady Rohanne and the whore in the crowd as clues to Jonquil then we also need to look at the various redheads throughout the books to see whether we can find more clues representative of Jonquil. \u00a0We can see from the descriptions of the redheads that I\u2019ve mentioned that she was most likely also short with freckles. \u00a0Then of course there is the implication that she was a prostitute. \u00a0</p><p>Except for the fact that she is a redhead, on first reading, none of these descriptions fit Sansa, the symbolic Jonquil in the story proper. \u00a0She is not short, does not have freckles and is of course not a whore. \u00a0However, she is connected to the world of prostitution via the fact that Petyr, the \u201cfather\u201d of her Alayne persona is a brothel owner who turned her best friend Jeyne into a whore before selling her to the Boltons as an Arya stand-in. \u00a0And as I will show a little later, the theme of shortness and freckles come into play in her story as well.</p><p>Now the fact that both Dunk and Jon have a thing for redheads and that several appear in their story arcs does not mean Jonquil was one as well. \u00a0In point of fact, a big part of my theory about her being a redhead has to do with Maidenpool and Duskendale.</p><p>The whore is not the only encounter Dunk has with a redhead at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows. \u00a0The other encounters are with males\u2014Ser Donnel, a knight of the King\u2019s Guard and Ser Manfred of House Dondarrion who like his descendent, Beric also has red gold hair. \u00a0And these individuals also point at the likelihood that Jonquil was a redhead. \u00a0This is especially true of Ser Donnel.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Dunk left the stable, Lord Ashford had escorted his princely guests into the hail, but two of the Kingsguard knights in their white armor and snowy cloaks still lingered in the yard, talking with the captain of the guard. Dunk halted before them. &ldquo;M'lords, I am Ser Duncan the Tall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well met, Ser Duncan,&rdquo; answered the bigger of the white knights. &ldquo;I am Ser Roland Crakehall, and this is my Sworn Brother, <b>Ser Donnel of Duskendale</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>The seven champions of the Kingsguard were the most puissant warriors in all the Seven Kingdoms, saving only perhaps the crown prince, Baelor Breakspear himself. &ldquo;Have you come to enter the lists?&rdquo; Dunk asked anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;It would not be fitting for us to ride against those we are sworn to protect,&rdquo; answered <b>Ser Donnel, red of hair and beard</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>As I\u2019ve been working under the theory that Jonquil was a redhead, I found Ser Donnel\u2019s red hair to be an interesting detail because he is from Duskendale and as I mentioned above, it borders Maidenpool. \u00a0Something told me that point was important but there was no other detail given about him and his House was not mentioned in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and so I had to leave it alone. \u00a0That is until we first became aware of Jonquil Darke, the sworn shield of Good Queen Alysanne as revealed in the excerpt of <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> George posted on his website in advance of the book\u2019s release.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Manderly entertained the queen lavishly. At the welcoming feast an entire aurochs was roasted, and his lordship\u2019s daughter Jessamyn acted as the queen\u2019s cupbearer, filling her tankard with a strong northern ale that Her Grace pronounced finer than any wine she had ever tasted. Manderly also staged a small tourney in the queen\u2019s honor, to show the prowess of his knights. One of the fighters (though no knight) was revealed to be a woman, a wildling girl who had been captured by rangers north of the Wall and given to one of Lord Manderly\u2019s household knights to foster. Delighted by the girl\u2019s daring, Alysanne summoned her own sworn shield, <b>Jonquil Darke, and the wildling and the Scarlet Shadow dueled spear against sword</b> whilst the northmen roared in approval.</p><p><b>Fire &amp; Blood: Jaehaerys and Alysanne - Their Triumphs and Tragedies</b><b> </b></p></blockquote><p>Jonquil Darke also had something in common with Sansa Stark in that she was a bastard daughter. \u00a0In the case of the Scarlet Shadow, her father was the Lord of Duskendale. \u00a0Sansa is of course only pretending while Jonquil Darke was a true bastard but it is interesting that both are associated with the word. \u00a0Does this mean that the original Jonquil was also a bastard? \u00a0Yes, but not quite in the way you may think, as we will soon discover.</p><p>There is a ton of symbolism associated with the name of Jonquil Darke, which I will be discussing when I get to the section dedicated specifically to the character. \u00a0For now, let\u2019s discuss how and why she came by her Scarlet Shadow sobriquet. \u00a0</p><p>The shadow part of her moniker is because once she became Alysanne\u2019s personal guard, she never left her side. \u00a0When you saw the queen, Jonquil was always a step behind her. \u00a0She became Alysanne\u2019s figurative shadow.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as <b>the Serpent in Scarlet</b>. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. <b>In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow</b>, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>The scarlet sobriquet was because she always dressed in red. \u00a0Was this because red was the color of her House sigil? Quite possible! \u00a0Might she have had red hair as well? \u00a0This is also possible, as redheads seem to be very common in the Maidenpool/Duskendale area. \u00a0</p><p>Red hair is a result of a recessive gene that occurs in only about 2% of the world\u2019s population. \u00a0I know that we are dealing with a fantasy series but still in all, even with all the fantastical elements, George tends to stay within scientific norms. \u00a0For this reason, I would argue that the number of redheads referenced in the books from the Duskendale/Maidenpool area are numerically out of the statistical mean and like with the ones in attendance at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, it is meant to draw attention to Jonquil.</p><p>We can deduce from the legend of Florian the Brave, which I mentioned in <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-flo\" target=\"_blank\"><b>part 1</b></a><b> </b>of this series that on a Doylist level, Martin named the family members of the area houses after the famous original pair. \u00a0This makes sense on a Watsonian level as well since the Lords and Ladies of the said houses would also be inclined to name their progeny after such a storied pair. \u00a0</p><p>House Darke is a cadet branch of House Darklyn, which gives it a connection to the Duskendale/Maidenpool area. \u00a0This could explain why the Scarlet Shadow was given the name of Jonquil. \u00a0It also suggests that George wants the reader to associate and compare her and her background with the original Jonquil and so that is just what we will do.</p><p>She is known as the Scarlet Shadow and this moniker gave me my connection to Ser Donnel who is from the Duskendale area and whom I now propose was also a member of House Darklyn. \u00a0And while this does not have to be the case, one can\u2019t help but presupposed that the scarlet in her moniker is also in reference to her hair and she like Ser Donnel was a redhead. \u00a0</p><p>Not much is know about other members of House Darke or Darklyn except that they supported the blacks during the Dance with Dragons and that several sons were members of the Kings and Queens guard. \u00a0This included 7 sons of House Darklyn who were Kingsguard members and one Ser Harrold of House Darke who was a member of the Queen Rhaenrya\u2019s guard during the Dance of Dragons. \u00a0And we now know that a Jonquil Darke was a member of Queen Alysanne\u2019s guard. \u00a0It is interesting that the Darklyns protected the kings while the Darkes seem to have done the same for the queens. \u00a0There is probably a story there and maybe we will find out when<i> The Winds of Winter</i> is released.</p><p>The other interesting story about House Darklyn is of the Defiance of Duskendale which led to the then Lord of the House kidnapping King Aerys and his imprisoning him in a dark dungeon for half a year, which no doubt contributed to his already growing madness. \u00a0After Ser Barristan Selmy rescued him, Aerys had all members of House Darklyn and almost all of those from House Hollard, who supported the defiance killed. \u00a0The only family member of either house to survive was a young son of House Hollard. \u00a0Ser Barristan begged for his life and because Aerys owed him a debt for rescuing him from the dungeon, he granted the boon. \u00a0</p><p>Ser Barristan took the boy back to Kings Landing with him as his squire. \u00a0This lad was of course Dontos Hollard who grew up to be Sansa Stark\u2019s symbolic Florian. \u00a0A sad and poor version of the legendary knight was Dontos. \u00a0 He was only in it for the money but he did help her escape from Kings Landing and did teach her some valuable lessons about the game of thrones. \u00a0With Dontos, Sansa\u2019s pretend Florian being from Duskendale; we see again how heavily her arc is tied up with the past events from that area as well as Maidenpool region.</p><p>The color of Dontos hair is never given in the text but an interesting detail about him that is not often mentioned is that he is also called \u201cDontos the Red.\u201d \u00a0Why he has this moniker is never stated. \u00a0It may have something to do with his alcoholism and him possibly always being red of face. \u00a0However, with the preponderance of redheads from the Duskendale area, more than likely the moniker pertains to his hair color. \u00a0This is especially true as Dontos; the Red makes one immediately think of the famous Viking, Erik, the Red who was so named because of his red hair and beard.</p><p>Kiss by fire redheads are part of a very important and mysterious theme in the books. \u00a0If Dontos is a redhead as I speculate, then here we have another scarlet hair individual from Duskendale. \u00a0This is quite a lot of references to redheaded individuals from an area that ostensibly have nothing to do with the central story. \u00a0And yet, the tale of Duskendale and past events that happened there are referenced in all the books except for <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. \u00a0This includes the ancillary Dunk and Egg novellas. \u00a0Why? \u00a0</p><p>Why does it play such a major role in the arc of Sansa Stark? \u00a0She has actually never visited Duskendale as she went directly to the Vale after escaping from Kings Landing. \u00a0However, if she had traveled by land, she most likely would have travel through Duskendale on the way to the Vale. \u00a0But that was not her escape route. \u00a0Instead, she went by ship and so sailed directly to the Fingers. \u00a0Nonetheless, she is still strongly associated with the area as Dontos is from the region and it is where Brienne went in search of him and the missing Sansa.</p><p>Florian of course first saw Jonquil at Maidenpool, which as I\u2019ve previously noted, borders Duskendale. \u00a0@RoseOfRedLake has a wonderful <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a><b> </b>about the importance of Maidenpool and the role it has played in the story so far and potentially may in the future. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s because Duskendale neighbors Maidenpool that it is featured so prominently in the books. \u00a0That could be part of the reason but maybe there is more to it.</p><p>I wondered earlier whether Jonquil was from Maidenpool or if she was just visiting the pool on her way to another location. \u00a0As luck would have it, George has provided several hints in <i>Fire and Blood</i> that it may be the second option. </p><p>While on a royal progress with Jaehaerys, Alysanne decided to visit Jonquil\u2019s healing pool for a bath. \u00a0One interesting aspect of her visit is the fact prior to arriving in Maidenpool the couple visited Duskendale.</p><blockquote><p>They began with Stokeworth and Rosby, then moved north along the coast to Duskendale. \u00a0There, whilst the king viewed Lord Darklyn\u2019s boatyards and enjoyed an afternoon of fishing, the queen held the first of her women\u2019s courts, which were to become an important part of every royal progress to come. Only women and girls were welcome at these audiences; highborn or low, they were encouraged to come forward and share their fears, concerns, and hopes with the young queen.</p><p>The journey went without incident until the king and queen reached Maidenpool, where they were to be the guests of Lord and Lady Mooton for a fortnight before sailing across the Bay of Crabs to Wickenden, Gulltown, and the Vale.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>Before arriving in Maidenpool, the royal progress may have stopped at Antlers or Rook\u2019s Rest. \u00a0However, they could have travel directly from Duskendale to Maidenpool without a stop in-between. \u00a0As they were traveling along the coast, it would have been more likely that they stopped at Rook\u2019s Rest as opposed to Antlers but as it was a progress, they most likely stopped in both areas. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike with the mention of Stokeworth and Rosby, George makes no mention of these other two towns. \u00a0The text goes straight from Jaehaerys and Alysanne being in Duskendale to them in Maidenpool. \u00a0It\u2019s almost as if George wants you to associate the two towns with each other. \u00a0This is something he does on numerous occasions throughout the various books as the towns are often grouped together\u2026almost as a unit. \u00a0</p><p>I proposed that the reason for this is because Jonquil in point of fact was not from Maidenpool as many assume. \u00a0Maidenpool is the location of the famous pool where Florian first saw Jonquil but nowhere does it say that it was the location of her birth. \u00a0Instead, I believe Florian first saw her there simply because like Alysanne, her and her party stop there to rest and refresh themselves in the local pool. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that she was either from Duskendale or had family who resided there that she was visiting. \u00a0</p><p>As Jonquil was familiar with Florian\u2019s name, he might have been from the region as well. \u00a0And I think that this could be why Duskendale and Maidenpool are always linked in the text.</p><blockquote><p>This morning the puppeteers were doing the tale of Florian and Jonquil. The fat Dornishwoman was working Florian in his armor made of motley, while the tall girl held Jonquil&rsquo;s strings. &ldquo;You are no knight,&rdquo; she was saying as the puppet&rsquo;s mouth moved up and down. &ldquo;<b>I know you. You are Florian the Fool</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, my lady,&rdquo; the other puppet answered, kneeling. &ldquo;As great a fool as ever lived, and as great a knight as well.\u201d</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned that Jonquil might possibly have been from Duskendale or had family in the region. \u00a0However, there is one other area from which she might have been born. There are many hints in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> that suggest that Alysanne\u2019s story offer clues to that of Sansa. \u00a0And I think that one of the ways it does this is with the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0</p><p>Jaehaerys and Alysanne arrived in Maidenpool from Duskendale only for the queen to be attacked when she visited Jonquil\u2019s pool.</p><blockquote><p>The goodness of the little queen, the silence of the Starry Sept, and the exhortations of the Seven Speakers had won over most of the Faithful for Jaehaerys and his Alysanne\u2026but there are always some who will not be moved, and amongst the sisters who tended Jonquil\u2019s Pool were three such women, whose hearts were hard with hate. They told one another that their holy waters would be polluted forever were the queen allowed to bathe in them whilst carrying the king\u2019s \u201cabomination\u201d in her belly. Queen Alysanne had only slipped out of her clothing when they fell upon her with daggers they had concealed within their robes.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/046780d6b5481ebec3d1cab36d3f039b/tumblr_inline_pkfcywxDL61scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\"/></figure><p>Her ladies-in-waiting foiled the attempt on Alysanne and the two Kings Guards assigned to her. \u00a0However, it also forced her and Jaehaerys to end their progress and return to Kings Landing.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as the Serpent in Scarlet. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><p>So we have Alysanne who Martin has written to parallel Sansa in so many ways arriving at Maidenpool from Duskendale. \u00a0Then after visiting Jonquil\u2019s pool where she is attacked, she sends to Duskendale for her own personal female guard. \u00a0One that just happens to be named Jonquil and quite possibly may have been a redhead</p><p>Also, let\u2019s not forget that Brienne goes searching for Sansa, the in-story symbolic stand-in for Jonquil in Duskendale. \u00a0When she has no luck there she heads over to Maidenpool where Lord Tarly is now in control.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If the Stark girl were here, I&rsquo;d know it. She&rsquo;s run back north, I&rsquo;ll wager. Hoping to find refuge with one of her father&rsquo;s bannermen. She had best hope she chooses the right one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>She might have gone to the Vale instead</b>,&rdquo; Brienne heard herself blurt out, &ldquo;to her mother&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Randyll gave her a contemptuous look. &ldquo;Lady Lysa is dead. Some singer pushed her off a mountain. Littlefinger holds the Eyrie now &hellip; though not for long. The lords of the Vale are not the sort to bend their knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.&rdquo; </p><p><b>A Feast for Crows - Brienne III</b></p></blockquote><p>Brienne should have trusted her instincts because Sansa is of course in the Vale. \u00a0The interesting thing about the Vale is that it was the planned final destination of the royal progress and it was the next stop after Maidenpool. \u00a0The attack on Alysanne\u2019s forced the King and Queen returned to Kings Landing, making plans to visit the Vale at a future date. \u00a0As I mentioned previously, if Sansa had travelled to the Vale overland instead of via water, she would have followed the same path as Alysanne and Jaehaerys.</p><p>With all these symbolic Jonquils connected to or traveling from Duskendale to Maidenpool to the Vale, is it possible that the original followed the same path? \u00a0Is it possible that she was from Duskendale and she only stopped in Maidenpool on the way to her final destination in the Vale? \u00a0Or is the reverse true and she was traveling from the Vale to Duskendale and only stopped in Maidenpool to rest. \u00a0With Sansa\u2019s symbolic connection to all three areas, I believe that one of these options is true and it is what George wants us to consider. \u00a0And if we can figure out which one is correct, we may be one step closer to answering the great mystery of the series.</p><p>We have reviewed the many clues that suggest that Jonquil was a \u201ckissed by fire\u201d redhead and briefly looked at hints that she was also short in stature. \u00a0All of the females that I mentioned who tip to Jonquil having red hair were described as short or at least it was intimated that they were. \u00a0Let\u2019s now look at one other scene with Dunk, the Florian that supports my thesis that she was short. \u00a0It\u2019s a memory that occurs to Dunk just after he speaks to Tanselle, the Jonquil surrogate for the first time. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Will you drink a horn of ale?&rdquo; he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. &ldquo;With me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They&rsquo;re made with pork, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, m'lord, but we have another show.&rdquo; The girl rose, and ran off to the fierce fat Dornishwoman who worked the puppet knight while Dunk stood there feeling stupid. He liked the way she ran, though. A pretty girl, and tall. I would not have to kneel to kiss that one. <b>He knew how to kiss</b>.</p><p>A tavern girl had showed him one night in Lannisport, a year ago, <b>but she&rsquo;d been so short she had to sit on the table to reach his lips</b>. The memory made his ears burn. <b>What a great fool he was</b>. It was jousting he should be thinking about, not kissing.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>Why did Martin make the girl of Dunk\u2019s memory so short in height if it was not to hint at something? \u00a0As the memory of her comes to him just after he has seen the puppet show about Florian and Jonquil and his brief conversation with Tanselle, it\u2019s quite possible that it\u2019s a clue to Jonquil\u2019s height. \u00a0At the same time, Martin also has Dunk mentally call himself a fool so that we the reader can link him to Florian and a short female. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that George keeps hinting at her being short in stature must mean that it is of some importance to the story. \u00a0I think that Jonquil\u2019s height is in fact of extreme consequence, as we will discover a bit later in the essay series.</p><p>One final point I want to mention about Dunk\u2019s brief conversation with Tanselle is his invitation for her to go and have a horn of ale and a pork sausage with him. \u00a0Dunk is an innocent but we the readers know that horns and sausages\u2026especially the pork kind comes with all sorts of sexual innuendos. \u00a0And so we see again how the fertility theme is constantly running through the Florian and Jonquil arc. \u00a0</p><p>This brings us to the end of part 3. \u00a0In the next chapter, sausages come into play again as we look at a curious textural error in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and ponder whether it was a mistake or if it was a deliberate on Martin\u2019s part. \u00a0And we also take a look at Mary Magdalene because if they are suggestions of a symbolic Christ in the story one would expect some hints of Mary Magdalene as well. It turns out that there quite possibly are such clues and in a most surprising way.</p><p>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181786342706/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

She had a quiver of arrows on one hip, and held a longbow that was just as tall as she was, which wasn\u2019t very tall. <b>If Dunk was shy an inch of seven feet, the archer was shy an inch of five</b>.

She was older than he\u2019d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, <b>but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose.

You know nothing, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>All three women are of course redheads. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure of the importance of the bouncy breasts\u2026maybe just George remembering someone in his personal life. \u00a0Who knows! \u00a0Ygritte and the redhead whore are the ones described as having bouncy breast\u2014not Rohanne. \u00a0In fact, as we see from this Dunk dream sequence, Rohanne\u2019s breasts were most likely pretty small.</p><blockquote><p>Drowsing at long last, Dunk dreamed. He was running through a glade in the heart of Wat\u2019s Wood, running toward Rohanne, and she was shooting arrows at him. Each shaft she loosed flew true, and pierced him through the chest, yet the pain was strangely sweet. He should have turned and fled, but he ran toward her instead, running slowly as you always did in dreams, as if the very air had turned to honey. Another arrow came, and yet another. Her quiver seemed to have no end of shafts. Her eyes were gray and green and full of mischief. Your gown brings out the color of your eyes, he meant to say to her, but she was not wearing any gown, or any clothes at all. <b>Across her small breasts was a faint spray of freckles, and her nipples were red and hard as little berries.</b> The arrows made him look like some great porcupine as he went stumbling to her feet, but somehow he still found the strength to grab her braid.</p><p>With one hard yank he pulled her down on top of him and kissed her.</p><p>He woke suddenly, at the sound of a shout.</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>Rohanne and Ygritte are also described as short and while the height of the whore walking through the crowds is not given, it is not a ridiculous assumption to assume that she was as well. \u00a0Dunk was almost 7 feet and so he would have no problem seeing a shorter person in a crowd. \u00a0I think the most important things to note about them are their height, red hair, freckles on their faces and archery skills of two of the three.</p><p>There is another redhead in the books whose description is intriguingly similar to these three women. \u00a0And like the redhead Dunk saw at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, she is also a whore.</p><blockquote><p>\"Is milord feeling unloved?\u201d Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. \u201cI have a cure for that.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. \u201cYou are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I\u2019ve grown fond of Alayaya\u2019s remedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but \u2018Yaya. She\u2019s good but I\u2019m better, don\u2019t you want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, perhaps.\u201d Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. <b>She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist</b>. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Dancy\u2019s height is not given but based on how she is described as sitting on Tyrion\u2019s lap, one can probably deduce that she is not too tall or else Tyrion\u2019s mental thoughts would have filled us in. \u00a0Again we get the bouncy reference but I am not even going to attempt to analyze GRRM\u2019s psyche or why he describes the whores and Ygritte, a Wilding girl in this manner but Lady Rohanne as having the more refined small breast.</p><p>There is also another redheaded whore that I want to point out. \u00a0This one appears in the scene when Arya hears the summoning bells that lead her to seeing her father beheaded. \u00a0While George does not use the word bouncy, you can see from the description of her breast that he is following the same theme.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe bells again, gods ha'mercy,\u201d wailed an old woman.</p><p><b>A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window</b>. \u201cIs it the boy king that\u2019s died now?\u201d she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \u201cAh, that\u2019s a boy for you, they never last long.\u201d As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.</p><p>\u201cStupid slut,\u201d the fat man shouted up. \u201cThe king\u2019s not dead, that\u2019s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.\u201d</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Arya V </b> </p></blockquote><p>George wants us to think of Dunk as the symbolic Florian. \u00a0He even goes so far to have him and Tanselle role play a scene from the song of Florian and Jonquil to push the point home. \u00a0Dunk also plays Florian in his travels throughout the land as a hedge knight and so we must look to the women he encounters for clues of Jonquil. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou must think me an utter fool.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAll men are fools, and all men are knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color paint do you have?\u201d he asked, hoping that might give him an idea.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight </b></p></blockquote><p>If we take the descriptions of Lady Rohanne and the whore in the crowd as clues to Jonquil then we also need to look at the various redheads throughout the books to see whether we can find more clues representative of Jonquil. \u00a0We can see from the descriptions of the redheads that I\u2019ve mentioned that she was most likely also short with freckles. \u00a0Then of course there is the implication that she was a prostitute. \u00a0</p><p>Except for the fact that she is a redhead, on first reading, none of these descriptions fit Sansa, the symbolic Jonquil in the story proper. \u00a0She is not short, does not have freckles and is of course not a whore. \u00a0However, she is connected to the world of prostitution via the fact that Petyr, the \u201cfather\u201d of her Alayne persona is a brothel owner who turned her best friend Jeyne into a whore before selling her to the Boltons as an Arya stand-in. \u00a0And as I will show a little later, the theme of shortness and freckles come into play in her story as well.</p><p>Now the fact that both Dunk and Jon have a thing for redheads and that several appear in their story arcs does not mean Jonquil was one as well. \u00a0In point of fact, a big part of my theory about her being a redhead has to do with Maidenpool and Duskendale.</p><p>The whore is not the only encounter Dunk has with a redhead at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows. \u00a0The other encounters are with males\u2014Ser Donnel, a knight of the King\u2019s Guard and Ser Manfred of House Dondarrion who like his descendent, Beric also has red gold hair. \u00a0And these individuals also point at the likelihood that Jonquil was a redhead. \u00a0This is especially true of Ser Donnel.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Dunk left the stable, Lord Ashford had escorted his princely guests into the hail, but two of the Kingsguard knights in their white armor and snowy cloaks still lingered in the yard, talking with the captain of the guard. Dunk halted before them. \u201cM'lords, I am Ser Duncan the Tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, Ser Duncan,\u201d answered the bigger of the white knights. \u201cI am Ser Roland Crakehall, and this is my Sworn Brother, <b>Ser Donnel of Duskendale</b>.\u201d</p><p>The seven champions of the Kingsguard were the most puissant warriors in all the Seven Kingdoms, saving only perhaps the crown prince, Baelor Breakspear himself. \u201cHave you come to enter the lists?\u201d Dunk asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cIt would not be fitting for us to ride against those we are sworn to protect,\u201d answered <b>Ser Donnel, red of hair and beard</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>As I\u2019ve been working under the theory that Jonquil was a redhead, I found Ser Donnel\u2019s red hair to be an interesting detail because he is from Duskendale and as I mentioned above, it borders Maidenpool. \u00a0Something told me that point was important but there was no other detail given about him and his House was not mentioned in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and so I had to leave it alone. \u00a0That is until we first became aware of Jonquil Darke, the sworn shield of Good Queen Alysanne as revealed in the excerpt of <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> George posted on his website in advance of the book\u2019s release.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Manderly entertained the queen lavishly. At the welcoming feast an entire aurochs was roasted, and his lordship\u2019s daughter Jessamyn acted as the queen\u2019s cupbearer, filling her tankard with a strong northern ale that Her Grace pronounced finer than any wine she had ever tasted. Manderly also staged a small tourney in the queen\u2019s honor, to show the prowess of his knights. One of the fighters (though no knight) was revealed to be a woman, a wildling girl who had been captured by rangers north of the Wall and given to one of Lord Manderly\u2019s household knights to foster. Delighted by the girl\u2019s daring, Alysanne summoned her own sworn shield, <b>Jonquil Darke, and the wildling and the Scarlet Shadow dueled spear against sword</b> whilst the northmen roared in approval.</p><p><b>Fire &amp; Blood: Jaehaerys and Alysanne - Their Triumphs and Tragedies</b><b> </b></p></blockquote><p>Jonquil Darke also had something in common with Sansa Stark in that she was a bastard daughter. \u00a0In the case of the Scarlet Shadow, her father was the Lord of Duskendale. \u00a0Sansa is of course only pretending while Jonquil Darke was a true bastard but it is interesting that both are associated with the word. \u00a0Does this mean that the original Jonquil was also a bastard? \u00a0Yes, but not quite in the way you may think, as we will soon discover.</p><p>There is a ton of symbolism associated with the name of Jonquil Darke, which I will be discussing when I get to the section dedicated specifically to the character. \u00a0For now, let\u2019s discuss how and why she came by her Scarlet Shadow sobriquet. \u00a0</p><p>The shadow part of her moniker is because once she became Alysanne\u2019s personal guard, she never left her side. \u00a0When you saw the queen, Jonquil was always a step behind her. \u00a0She became Alysanne\u2019s figurative shadow.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as <b>the Serpent in Scarlet</b>. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. <b>In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow</b>, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>The scarlet sobriquet was because she always dressed in red. \u00a0Was this because red was the color of her House sigil? Quite possible! \u00a0Might she have had red hair as well? \u00a0This is also possible, as redheads seem to be very common in the Maidenpool/Duskendale area. \u00a0</p><p>Red hair is a result of a recessive gene that occurs in only about 2% of the world\u2019s population. \u00a0I know that we are dealing with a fantasy series but still in all, even with all the fantastical elements, George tends to stay within scientific norms. \u00a0For this reason, I would argue that the number of redheads referenced in the books from the Duskendale/Maidenpool area are numerically out of the statistical mean and like with the ones in attendance at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, it is meant to draw attention to Jonquil.</p><p>We can deduce from the legend of Florian the Brave, which I mentioned in <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-flo\" target=\"_blank\"><b>part 1</b></a><b> </b>of this series that on a Doylist level, Martin named the family members of the area houses after the famous original pair. \u00a0This makes sense on a Watsonian level as well since the Lords and Ladies of the said houses would also be inclined to name their progeny after such a storied pair. \u00a0</p><p>House Darke is a cadet branch of House Darklyn, which gives it a connection to the Duskendale/Maidenpool area. \u00a0This could explain why the Scarlet Shadow was given the name of Jonquil. \u00a0It also suggests that George wants the reader to associate and compare her and her background with the original Jonquil and so that is just what we will do.</p><p>She is known as the Scarlet Shadow and this moniker gave me my connection to Ser Donnel who is from the Duskendale area and whom I now propose was also a member of House Darklyn. \u00a0And while this does not have to be the case, one can\u2019t help but presupposed that the scarlet in her moniker is also in reference to her hair and she like Ser Donnel was a redhead. \u00a0</p><p>Not much is know about other members of House Darke or Darklyn except that they supported the blacks during the Dance with Dragons and that several sons were members of the Kings and Queens guard. \u00a0This included 7 sons of House Darklyn who were Kingsguard members and one Ser Harrold of House Darke who was a member of the Queen Rhaenrya\u2019s guard during the Dance of Dragons. \u00a0And we now know that a Jonquil Darke was a member of Queen Alysanne\u2019s guard. \u00a0It is interesting that the Darklyns protected the kings while the Darkes seem to have done the same for the queens. \u00a0There is probably a story there and maybe we will find out when<i> The Winds of Winter</i> is released.</p><p>The other interesting story about House Darklyn is of the Defiance of Duskendale which led to the then Lord of the House kidnapping King Aerys and his imprisoning him in a dark dungeon for half a year, which no doubt contributed to his already growing madness. \u00a0After Ser Barristan Selmy rescued him, Aerys had all members of House Darklyn and almost all of those from House Hollard, who supported the defiance killed. \u00a0The only family member of either house to survive was a young son of House Hollard. \u00a0Ser Barristan begged for his life and because Aerys owed him a debt for rescuing him from the dungeon, he granted the boon. \u00a0</p><p>Ser Barristan took the boy back to Kings Landing with him as his squire. \u00a0This lad was of course Dontos Hollard who grew up to be Sansa Stark\u2019s symbolic Florian. \u00a0A sad and poor version of the legendary knight was Dontos. \u00a0 He was only in it for the money but he did help her escape from Kings Landing and did teach her some valuable lessons about the game of thrones. \u00a0With Dontos, Sansa\u2019s pretend Florian being from Duskendale; we see again how heavily her arc is tied up with the past events from that area as well as Maidenpool region.</p><p>The color of Dontos hair is never given in the text but an interesting detail about him that is not often mentioned is that he is also called \u201cDontos the Red.\u201d \u00a0Why he has this moniker is never stated. \u00a0It may have something to do with his alcoholism and him possibly always being red of face. \u00a0However, with the preponderance of redheads from the Duskendale area, more than likely the moniker pertains to his hair color. \u00a0This is especially true as Dontos; the Red makes one immediately think of the famous Viking, Erik, the Red who was so named because of his red hair and beard.</p><p>Kiss by fire redheads are part of a very important and mysterious theme in the books. \u00a0If Dontos is a redhead as I speculate, then here we have another scarlet hair individual from Duskendale. \u00a0This is quite a lot of references to redheaded individuals from an area that ostensibly have nothing to do with the central story. \u00a0And yet, the tale of Duskendale and past events that happened there are referenced in all the books except for <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. \u00a0This includes the ancillary Dunk and Egg novellas. \u00a0Why? \u00a0</p><p>Why does it play such a major role in the arc of Sansa Stark? \u00a0She has actually never visited Duskendale as she went directly to the Vale after escaping from Kings Landing. \u00a0However, if she had traveled by land, she most likely would have travel through Duskendale on the way to the Vale. \u00a0But that was not her escape route. \u00a0Instead, she went by ship and so sailed directly to the Fingers. \u00a0Nonetheless, she is still strongly associated with the area as Dontos is from the region and it is where Brienne went in search of him and the missing Sansa.</p><p>Florian of course first saw Jonquil at Maidenpool, which as I\u2019ve previously noted, borders Duskendale. \u00a0@RoseOfRedLake has a wonderful <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a><b> </b>about the importance of Maidenpool and the role it has played in the story so far and potentially may in the future. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s because Duskendale neighbors Maidenpool that it is featured so prominently in the books. \u00a0That could be part of the reason but maybe there is more to it.</p><p>I wondered earlier whether Jonquil was from Maidenpool or if she was just visiting the pool on her way to another location. \u00a0As luck would have it, George has provided several hints in <i>Fire and Blood</i> that it may be the second option. </p><p>While on a royal progress with Jaehaerys, Alysanne decided to visit Jonquil\u2019s healing pool for a bath. \u00a0One interesting aspect of her visit is the fact prior to arriving in Maidenpool the couple visited Duskendale.</p><blockquote><p>They began with Stokeworth and Rosby, then moved north along the coast to Duskendale. \u00a0There, whilst the king viewed Lord Darklyn\u2019s boatyards and enjoyed an afternoon of fishing, the queen held the first of her women\u2019s courts, which were to become an important part of every royal progress to come. Only women and girls were welcome at these audiences; highborn or low, they were encouraged to come forward and share their fears, concerns, and hopes with the young queen.</p><p>The journey went without incident until the king and queen reached Maidenpool, where they were to be the guests of Lord and Lady Mooton for a fortnight before sailing across the Bay of Crabs to Wickenden, Gulltown, and the Vale.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>Before arriving in Maidenpool, the royal progress may have stopped at Antlers or Rook\u2019s Rest. \u00a0However, they could have travel directly from Duskendale to Maidenpool without a stop in-between. \u00a0As they were traveling along the coast, it would have been more likely that they stopped at Rook\u2019s Rest as opposed to Antlers but as it was a progress, they most likely stopped in both areas. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike with the mention of Stokeworth and Rosby, George makes no mention of these other two towns. \u00a0The text goes straight from Jaehaerys and Alysanne being in Duskendale to them in Maidenpool. \u00a0It\u2019s almost as if George wants you to associate the two towns with each other. \u00a0This is something he does on numerous occasions throughout the various books as the towns are often grouped together\u2026almost as a unit. \u00a0</p><p>I proposed that the reason for this is because Jonquil in point of fact was not from Maidenpool as many assume. \u00a0Maidenpool is the location of the famous pool where Florian first saw Jonquil but nowhere does it say that it was the location of her birth. \u00a0Instead, I believe Florian first saw her there simply because like Alysanne, her and her party stop there to rest and refresh themselves in the local pool. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that she was either from Duskendale or had family who resided there that she was visiting. \u00a0</p><p>As Jonquil was familiar with Florian\u2019s name, he might have been from the region as well. \u00a0And I think that this could be why Duskendale and Maidenpool are always linked in the text.</p><blockquote><p>This morning the puppeteers were doing the tale of Florian and Jonquil. The fat Dornishwoman was working Florian in his armor made of motley, while the tall girl held Jonquil\u2019s strings. \u201cYou are no knight,\u201d she was saying as the puppet\u2019s mouth moved up and down. \u201c<b>I know you. You are Florian the Fool</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, my lady,\u201d the other puppet answered, kneeling. \u201cAs great a fool as ever lived, and as great a knight as well.\u201d</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned that Jonquil might possibly have been from Duskendale or had family in the region. \u00a0However, there is one other area from which she might have been born. There are many hints in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> that suggest that Alysanne\u2019s story offer clues to that of Sansa. \u00a0And I think that one of the ways it does this is with the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0</p><p>Jaehaerys and Alysanne arrived in Maidenpool from Duskendale only for the queen to be attacked when she visited Jonquil\u2019s pool.</p><blockquote><p>The goodness of the little queen, the silence of the Starry Sept, and the exhortations of the Seven Speakers had won over most of the Faithful for Jaehaerys and his Alysanne\u2026but there are always some who will not be moved, and amongst the sisters who tended Jonquil\u2019s Pool were three such women, whose hearts were hard with hate. They told one another that their holy waters would be polluted forever were the queen allowed to bathe in them whilst carrying the king\u2019s \u201cabomination\u201d in her belly. Queen Alysanne had only slipped out of her clothing when they fell upon her with daggers they had concealed within their robes.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/046780d6b5481ebec3d1cab36d3f039b/tumblr_inline_pkfcywxDL61scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\"></figure><p>Her ladies-in-waiting foiled the attempt on Alysanne and the two Kings Guards assigned to her. \u00a0However, it also forced her and Jaehaerys to end their progress and return to Kings Landing.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as the Serpent in Scarlet. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><p>So we have Alysanne who Martin has written to parallel Sansa in so many ways arriving at Maidenpool from Duskendale. \u00a0Then after visiting Jonquil\u2019s pool where she is attacked, she sends to Duskendale for her own personal female guard. \u00a0One that just happens to be named Jonquil and quite possibly may have been a redhead</p><p>Also, let\u2019s not forget that Brienne goes searching for Sansa, the in-story symbolic stand-in for Jonquil in Duskendale. \u00a0When she has no luck there she heads over to Maidenpool where Lord Tarly is now in control.</p><blockquote><p>\"If the Stark girl were here, I\u2019d know it. She\u2019s run back north, I\u2019ll wager. Hoping to find refuge with one of her father\u2019s bannermen. She had best hope she chooses the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>She might have gone to the Vale instead</b>,\u201d Brienne heard herself blurt out, \u201cto her mother\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Lord Randyll gave her a contemptuous look. \u201cLady Lysa is dead. Some singer pushed her off a mountain. Littlefinger holds the Eyrie now \u2026 though not for long. The lords of the Vale are not the sort to bend their knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.\u201d </p><p><b>A Feast for Crows - Brienne III</b></p></blockquote><p>Brienne should have trusted her instincts because Sansa is of course in the Vale. \u00a0The interesting thing about the Vale is that it was the planned final destination of the royal progress and it was the next stop after Maidenpool. \u00a0The attack on Alysanne\u2019s forced the King and Queen returned to Kings Landing, making plans to visit the Vale at a future date. \u00a0As I mentioned previously, if Sansa had travelled to the Vale overland instead of via water, she would have followed the same path as Alysanne and Jaehaerys.</p><p>With all these symbolic Jonquils connected to or traveling from Duskendale to Maidenpool to the Vale, is it possible that the original followed the same path? \u00a0Is it possible that she was from Duskendale and she only stopped in Maidenpool on the way to her final destination in the Vale? \u00a0Or is the reverse true and she was traveling from the Vale to Duskendale and only stopped in Maidenpool to rest. \u00a0With Sansa\u2019s symbolic connection to all three areas, I believe that one of these options is true and it is what George wants us to consider. \u00a0And if we can figure out which one is correct, we may be one step closer to answering the great mystery of the series.</p><p>We have reviewed the many clues that suggest that Jonquil was a \u201ckissed by fire\u201d redhead and briefly looked at hints that she was also short in stature. \u00a0All of the females that I mentioned who tip to Jonquil having red hair were described as short or at least it was intimated that they were. \u00a0Let\u2019s now look at one other scene with Dunk, the Florian that supports my thesis that she was short. \u00a0It\u2019s a memory that occurs to Dunk just after he speaks to Tanselle, the Jonquil surrogate for the first time. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cWill you drink a horn of ale?\u201d he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. \u201cWith me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They\u2019re made with pork, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, m'lord, but we have another show.\u201d The girl rose, and ran off to the fierce fat Dornishwoman who worked the puppet knight while Dunk stood there feeling stupid. He liked the way she ran, though. A pretty girl, and tall. I would not have to kneel to kiss that one. <b>He knew how to kiss</b>.</p><p>A tavern girl had showed him one night in Lannisport, a year ago, <b>but she\u2019d been so short she had to sit on the table to reach his lips</b>. The memory made his ears burn. <b>What a great fool he was</b>. It was jousting he should be thinking about, not kissing.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>Why did Martin make the girl of Dunk\u2019s memory so short in height if it was not to hint at something? \u00a0As the memory of her comes to him just after he has seen the puppet show about Florian and Jonquil and his brief conversation with Tanselle, it\u2019s quite possible that it\u2019s a clue to Jonquil\u2019s height. \u00a0At the same time, Martin also has Dunk mentally call himself a fool so that we the reader can link him to Florian and a short female. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that George keeps hinting at her being short in stature must mean that it is of some importance to the story. \u00a0I think that Jonquil\u2019s height is in fact of extreme consequence, as we will discover a bit later in the essay series.</p><p>One final point I want to mention about Dunk\u2019s brief conversation with Tanselle is his invitation for her to go and have a horn of ale and a pork sausage with him. \u00a0Dunk is an innocent but we the readers know that horns and sausages\u2026especially the pork kind comes with all sorts of sexual innuendos. \u00a0And so we see again how the fertility theme is constantly running through the Florian and Jonquil arc. \u00a0</p><p>This brings us to the end of part 3. \u00a0In the next chapter, sausages come into play again as we look at a curious textural error in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and ponder whether it was a mistake or if it was a deliberate on Martin\u2019s part. \u00a0And we also take a look at Mary Magdalene because if they are suggestions of a symbolic Christ in the story one would expect some hints of Mary Magdalene as well. It turns out that there quite possibly are such clues and in a most surprising way.</p><p>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181786342706/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She\u2019d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous \u2026 but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the <b>red</b>-<b>haired</b> girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, <b>Dunk shook his head and walked away</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I find this scene with the whore very interesting as I think it might have been the inspiration for Dan and Dave\u2019s creation of Roz on the show. \u00a0And like Jon did with Roz, Dunk, rejects the red-haired whore. \u00a0</p><p>However, like Jon with Ygritte, we later see that Dunk definitely has a thing for redheads when he encounters Rohanne Weber in <i>The Sworn Sword</i>. \u00a0We will talk a little bit more about both Rohanne and Ygritte later in the essay but for now, I just want to discuss the similarities in their description to each other as well as to the red-hair whore that Dunk sees.</p>[[MORE]]<blockquote><p>\u201cAnd what is all this merriment?\u201d The voice cut through the laughter, cool and firm. \u201cWill no one share the jape? Ser knight, why are you troubling my good-sister?\u201d</p><p>It was the girl he had seen earlier at the archery butts. She had a quiver of arrows on one hip, and held a longbow that was just as tall as she was, which wasn\u2019t very tall. <b>If Dunk was shy an inch of seven feet, the archer was shy an inch of five</b>. He could have spanned her waist with his two hands. <b>Her red hair was bound up in a braid so long it brushed past her thighs, and she had a dimpled chin, a snub nose, and a light spray of freckles across her cheeks</b>.</p><p>\u201c<b>Forgive us, Lady Rohanne</b>.\u201d The speaker was a pretty young lord with the Caswell centaur embroidered on his doublet. \u201cThis great oaf took the Lady Helicent for you.\u201d</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>And here are a couple of descriptions of Ygritte. \u00a0Make note of the similarities between the three and keep in mind that like Lady Rohanne, Ygritte was also an archer.</p><blockquote><p>Ygritte watched and said nothing. She was older than he\u2019d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, <b>but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose. Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions.</b> She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather. Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon VI</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\u201cWe should.\u201d <b>Her breasts bounced</b> as she stood on one leg to pull one boot, then hopped onto her other foot to attend to the other. Her nipples were wide pink circles. \u201cYou as well,\u201d Ygritte said as she yanked down her sheepskin breeches. \u201cIf you want to look you have to show. You know nothing, Jon Snow.\u201d</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>All three women are of course redheads. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure of the importance of the bouncy breasts\u2026maybe just George remembering someone in his personal life. \u00a0Who knows! \u00a0Ygritte and the redhead whore are the ones described as having bouncy breast\u2014not Rohanne. \u00a0In fact, as we see from this Dunk dream sequence, Rohanne\u2019s breasts were most likely pretty small.</p><blockquote><p>Drowsing at long last, Dunk dreamed. He was running through a glade in the heart of Wat\u2019s Wood, running toward Rohanne, and she was shooting arrows at him. Each shaft she loosed flew true, and pierced him through the chest, yet the pain was strangely sweet. He should have turned and fled, but he ran toward her instead, running slowly as you always did in dreams, as if the very air had turned to honey. Another arrow came, and yet another. Her quiver seemed to have no end of shafts. Her eyes were gray and green and full of mischief. Your gown brings out the color of your eyes, he meant to say to her, but she was not wearing any gown, or any clothes at all. <b>Across her small breasts was a faint spray of freckles, and her nipples were red and hard as little berries.</b> The arrows made him look like some great porcupine as he went stumbling to her feet, but somehow he still found the strength to grab her braid.</p><p>With one hard yank he pulled her down on top of him and kissed her.</p><p>He woke suddenly, at the sound of a shout.</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>Rohanne and Ygritte are also described as short and while the height of the whore walking through the crowds is not given, it is not a ridiculous assumption to assume that she was as well. \u00a0Dunk was almost 7 feet and so he would have no problem seeing a shorter person in a crowd. \u00a0I think the most important things to note about them are their height, red hair, freckles on their faces and archery skills of two of the three.</p><p>There is another redhead in the books whose description is intriguingly similar to these three women. \u00a0And like the redhead Dunk saw at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, she is also a whore.</p><blockquote><p>\"Is milord feeling unloved?\u201d Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. \u201cI have a cure for that.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. \u201cYou are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I\u2019ve grown fond of Alayaya\u2019s remedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but \u2018Yaya. She\u2019s good but I\u2019m better, don\u2019t you want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, perhaps.\u201d Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. <b>She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist</b>. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Dancy\u2019s height is not given but based on how she is described as sitting on Tyrion\u2019s lap, one can probably deduce that she is not too tall or else Tyrion\u2019s mental thoughts would have filled us in. \u00a0Again we get the bouncy reference but I am not even going to attempt to analyze GRRM\u2019s psyche or why he describes the whores and Ygritte, a Wilding girl in this manner but Lady Rohanne as having the more refined small breast.</p><p>There is also another redheaded whore that I want to point out. \u00a0This one appears in the scene when Arya hears the summoning bells that lead her to seeing her father beheaded. \u00a0While George does not use the word bouncy, you can see from the description of her breast that he is following the same theme.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe bells again, gods ha'mercy,\u201d wailed an old woman.</p><p><b>A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window</b>. \u201cIs it the boy king that\u2019s died now?\u201d she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \u201cAh, that\u2019s a boy for you, they never last long.\u201d As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.</p><p>\u201cStupid slut,\u201d the fat man shouted up. \u201cThe king\u2019s not dead, that\u2019s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.\u201d</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Arya V </b> </p></blockquote><p>George wants us to think of Dunk as the symbolic Florian. \u00a0He even goes so far to have him and Tanselle role play a scene from the song of Florian and Jonquil to push the point home. \u00a0Dunk also plays Florian in his travels throughout the land as a hedge knight and so we must look to the women he encounters for clues of Jonquil. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cYou must think me an utter fool.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAll men are fools, and all men are knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color paint do you have?\u201d he asked, hoping that might give him an idea.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight </b></p></blockquote><p>If we take the descriptions of Lady Rohanne and the whore in the crowd as clues to Jonquil then we also need to look at the various redheads throughout the books to see whether we can find more clues representative of Jonquil. \u00a0We can see from the descriptions of the redheads that I\u2019ve mentioned that she was most likely also short with freckles. \u00a0Then of course there is the implication that she was a prostitute. \u00a0</p><p>Except for the fact that she is a redhead, on first reading, none of these descriptions fit Sansa, the symbolic Jonquil in the story proper. \u00a0She is not short, does not have freckles and is of course not a whore. \u00a0However, she is connected to the world of prostitution via the fact that Petyr, the \u201cfather\u201d of her Alayne persona is a brothel owner who turned her best friend Jeyne into a whore before selling her to the Boltons as an Arya stand-in. \u00a0And as I will show a little later, the theme of shortness and freckles come into play in her story as well.</p><p>Now the fact that both Dunk and Jon have a thing for redheads and that several appear in their story arcs does not mean Jonquil was one as well. \u00a0In point of fact, a big part of my theory about her being a redhead has to do with Maidenpool and Duskendale.</p><p>The whore is not the only encounter Dunk has with a redhead at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows. \u00a0The other encounters are with males\u2014Ser Donnel, a knight of the King\u2019s Guard and Ser Manfred of House Dondarrion who like his descendent, Beric also has red gold hair. \u00a0And these individuals also point at the likelihood that Jonquil was a redhead. \u00a0This is especially true of Ser Donnel.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Dunk left the stable, Lord Ashford had escorted his princely guests into the hail, but two of the Kingsguard knights in their white armor and snowy cloaks still lingered in the yard, talking with the captain of the guard. Dunk halted before them. \u201cM'lords, I am Ser Duncan the Tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell met, Ser Duncan,\u201d answered the bigger of the white knights. \u201cI am Ser Roland Crakehall, and this is my Sworn Brother, <b>Ser Donnel of Duskendale</b>.\u201d</p><p>The seven champions of the Kingsguard were the most puissant warriors in all the Seven Kingdoms, saving only perhaps the crown prince, Baelor Breakspear himself. \u201cHave you come to enter the lists?\u201d Dunk asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cIt would not be fitting for us to ride against those we are sworn to protect,\u201d answered <b>Ser Donnel, red of hair and beard</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>As I\u2019ve been working under the theory that Jonquil was a redhead, I found Ser Donnel\u2019s red hair to be an interesting detail because he is from Duskendale and as I mentioned above, it borders Maidenpool. \u00a0Something told me that point was important but there was no other detail given about him and his House was not mentioned in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and so I had to leave it alone. \u00a0That is until we first became aware of Jonquil Darke, the sworn shield of Good Queen Alysanne as revealed in the excerpt of <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> George posted on his website in advance of the book\u2019s release.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Manderly entertained the queen lavishly. At the welcoming feast an entire aurochs was roasted, and his lordship\u2019s daughter Jessamyn acted as the queen\u2019s cupbearer, filling her tankard with a strong northern ale that Her Grace pronounced finer than any wine she had ever tasted. Manderly also staged a small tourney in the queen\u2019s honor, to show the prowess of his knights. One of the fighters (though no knight) was revealed to be a woman, a wildling girl who had been captured by rangers north of the Wall and given to one of Lord Manderly\u2019s household knights to foster. Delighted by the girl\u2019s daring, Alysanne summoned her own sworn shield, <b>Jonquil Darke, and the wildling and the Scarlet Shadow dueled spear against sword</b> whilst the northmen roared in approval.</p><p><b>Fire &amp; Blood: Jaehaerys and Alysanne - Their Triumphs and Tragedies</b><b> </b></p></blockquote><p>Jonquil Darke also had something in common with Sansa Stark in that she was a bastard daughter. \u00a0In the case of the Scarlet Shadow, her father was the Lord of Duskendale. \u00a0Sansa is of course only pretending while Jonquil Darke was a true bastard but it is interesting that both are associated with the word. \u00a0Does this mean that the original Jonquil was also a bastard? \u00a0Yes, but not quite in the way you may think, as we will soon discover.</p><p>There is a ton of symbolism associated with the name of Jonquil Darke, which I will be discussing when I get to the section dedicated specifically to the character. \u00a0For now, let\u2019s discuss how and why she came by her Scarlet Shadow sobriquet. \u00a0</p><p>The shadow part of her moniker is because once she became Alysanne\u2019s personal guard, she never left her side. \u00a0When you saw the queen, Jonquil was always a step behind her. \u00a0She became Alysanne\u2019s figurative shadow.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as <b>the Serpent in Scarlet</b>. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. <b>In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow</b>, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>The scarlet sobriquet was because she always dressed in red. \u00a0Was this because red was the color of her House sigil? Quite possible! \u00a0Might she have had red hair as well? \u00a0This is also possible, as redheads seem to be very common in the Maidenpool/Duskendale area. \u00a0</p><p>Red hair is a result of a recessive gene that occurs in only about 2% of the world\u2019s population. \u00a0I know that we are dealing with a fantasy series but still in all, even with all the fantastical elements, George tends to stay within scientific norms. \u00a0For this reason, I would argue that the number of redheads referenced in the books from the Duskendale/Maidenpool area are numerically out of the statistical mean and like with the ones in attendance at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, it is meant to draw attention to Jonquil.</p><p>We can deduce from the legend of Florian the Brave, which I mentioned in <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-flo\" target=\"_blank\"><b>part 1</b></a><b> </b>of this series that on a Doylist level, Martin named the family members of the area houses after the famous original pair. \u00a0This makes sense on a Watsonian level as well since the Lords and Ladies of the said houses would also be inclined to name their progeny after such a storied pair. \u00a0</p><p>House Darke is a cadet branch of House Darklyn, which gives it a connection to the Duskendale/Maidenpool area. \u00a0This could explain why the Scarlet Shadow was given the name of Jonquil. \u00a0It also suggests that George wants the reader to associate and compare her and her background with the original Jonquil and so that is just what we will do.</p><p>She is known as the Scarlet Shadow and this moniker gave me my connection to Ser Donnel who is from the Duskendale area and whom I now propose was also a member of House Darklyn. \u00a0And while this does not have to be the case, one can\u2019t help but presupposed that the scarlet in her moniker is also in reference to her hair and she like Ser Donnel was a redhead. \u00a0</p><p>Not much is know about other members of House Darke or Darklyn except that they supported the blacks during the Dance with Dragons and that several sons were members of the Kings and Queens guard. \u00a0This included 7 sons of House Darklyn who were Kingsguard members and one Ser Harrold of House Darke who was a member of the Queen Rhaenrya\u2019s guard during the Dance of Dragons. \u00a0And we now know that a Jonquil Darke was a member of Queen Alysanne\u2019s guard. \u00a0It is interesting that the Darklyns protected the kings while the Darkes seem to have done the same for the queens. \u00a0There is probably a story there and maybe we will find out when<i> The Winds of Winter</i> is released.</p><p>The other interesting story about House Darklyn is of the Defiance of Duskendale which led to the then Lord of the House kidnapping King Aerys and his imprisoning him in a dark dungeon for half a year, which no doubt contributed to his already growing madness. \u00a0After Ser Barristan Selmy rescued him, Aerys had all members of House Darklyn and almost all of those from House Hollard, who supported the defiance killed. \u00a0The only family member of either house to survive was a young son of House Hollard. \u00a0Ser Barristan begged for his life and because Aerys owed him a debt for rescuing him from the dungeon, he granted the boon. \u00a0</p><p>Ser Barristan took the boy back to Kings Landing with him as his squire. \u00a0This lad was of course Dontos Hollard who grew up to be Sansa Stark\u2019s symbolic Florian. \u00a0A sad and poor version of the legendary knight was Dontos. \u00a0 He was only in it for the money but he did help her escape from Kings Landing and did teach her some valuable lessons about the game of thrones. \u00a0With Dontos, Sansa\u2019s pretend Florian being from Duskendale; we see again how heavily her arc is tied up with the past events from that area as well as Maidenpool region.</p><p>The color of Dontos hair is never given in the text but an interesting detail about him that is not often mentioned is that he is also called \u201cDontos the Red.\u201d \u00a0Why he has this moniker is never stated. \u00a0It may have something to do with his alcoholism and him possibly always being red of face. \u00a0However, with the preponderance of redheads from the Duskendale area, more than likely the moniker pertains to his hair color. \u00a0This is especially true as Dontos; the Red makes one immediately think of the famous Viking, Erik, the Red who was so named because of his red hair and beard.</p><p>Kiss by fire redheads are part of a very important and mysterious theme in the books. \u00a0If Dontos is a redhead as I speculate, then here we have another scarlet hair individual from Duskendale. \u00a0This is quite a lot of references to redheaded individuals from an area that ostensibly have nothing to do with the central story. \u00a0And yet, the tale of Duskendale and past events that happened there are referenced in all the books except for <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. \u00a0This includes the ancillary Dunk and Egg novellas. \u00a0Why? \u00a0</p><p>Why does it play such a major role in the arc of Sansa Stark? \u00a0She has actually never visited Duskendale as she went directly to the Vale after escaping from Kings Landing. \u00a0However, if she had traveled by land, she most likely would have travel through Duskendale on the way to the Vale. \u00a0But that was not her escape route. \u00a0Instead, she went by ship and so sailed directly to the Fingers. \u00a0Nonetheless, she is still strongly associated with the area as Dontos is from the region and it is where Brienne went in search of him and the missing Sansa.</p><p>Florian of course first saw Jonquil at Maidenpool, which as I\u2019ve previously noted, borders Duskendale. \u00a0@RoseOfRedLake has a wonderful <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a><b> </b>about the importance of Maidenpool and the role it has played in the story so far and potentially may in the future. \u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s because Duskendale neighbors Maidenpool that it is featured so prominently in the books. \u00a0That could be part of the reason but maybe there is more to it.</p><p>I wondered earlier whether Jonquil was from Maidenpool or if she was just visiting the pool on her way to another location. \u00a0As luck would have it, George has provided several hints in <i>Fire and Blood</i> that it may be the second option. </p><p>While on a royal progress with Jaehaerys, Alysanne decided to visit Jonquil\u2019s healing pool for a bath. \u00a0One interesting aspect of her visit is the fact prior to arriving in Maidenpool the couple visited Duskendale.</p><blockquote><p>They began with Stokeworth and Rosby, then moved north along the coast to Duskendale. \u00a0There, whilst the king viewed Lord Darklyn\u2019s boatyards and enjoyed an afternoon of fishing, the queen held the first of her women\u2019s courts, which were to become an important part of every royal progress to come. Only women and girls were welcome at these audiences; highborn or low, they were encouraged to come forward and share their fears, concerns, and hopes with the young queen.</p><p>The journey went without incident until the king and queen reached Maidenpool, where they were to be the guests of Lord and Lady Mooton for a fortnight before sailing across the Bay of Crabs to Wickenden, Gulltown, and the Vale.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>Before arriving in Maidenpool, the royal progress may have stopped at Antlers or Rook\u2019s Rest. \u00a0However, they could have travel directly from Duskendale to Maidenpool without a stop in-between. \u00a0As they were traveling along the coast, it would have been more likely that they stopped at Rook\u2019s Rest as opposed to Antlers but as it was a progress, they most likely stopped in both areas. \u00a0</p><p>However, unlike with the mention of Stokeworth and Rosby, George makes no mention of these other two towns. \u00a0The text goes straight from Jaehaerys and Alysanne being in Duskendale to them in Maidenpool. \u00a0It\u2019s almost as if George wants you to associate the two towns with each other. \u00a0This is something he does on numerous occasions throughout the various books as the towns are often grouped together\u2026almost as a unit. \u00a0</p><p>I proposed that the reason for this is because Jonquil in point of fact was not from Maidenpool as many assume. \u00a0Maidenpool is the location of the famous pool where Florian first saw Jonquil but nowhere does it say that it was the location of her birth. \u00a0Instead, I believe Florian first saw her there simply because like Alysanne, her and her party stop there to rest and refresh themselves in the local pool. \u00a0I think that it\u2019s possible that she was either from Duskendale or had family who resided there that she was visiting. \u00a0</p><p>As Jonquil was familiar with Florian\u2019s name, he might have been from the region as well. \u00a0And I think that this could be why Duskendale and Maidenpool are always linked in the text.</p><blockquote><p>This morning the puppeteers were doing the tale of Florian and Jonquil. The fat Dornishwoman was working Florian in his armor made of motley, while the tall girl held Jonquil\u2019s strings. \u201cYou are no knight,\u201d she was saying as the puppet\u2019s mouth moved up and down. \u201c<b>I know you. You are Florian the Fool</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, my lady,\u201d the other puppet answered, kneeling. \u201cAs great a fool as ever lived, and as great a knight as well.\u201d</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned that Jonquil might possibly have been from Duskendale or had family in the region. \u00a0However, there is one other area from which she might have been born. There are many hints in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> that suggest that Alysanne\u2019s story offer clues to that of Sansa. \u00a0And I think that one of the ways it does this is with the story of Florian and Jonquil. \u00a0</p><p>Jaehaerys and Alysanne arrived in Maidenpool from Duskendale only for the queen to be attacked when she visited Jonquil\u2019s pool.</p><blockquote><p>The goodness of the little queen, the silence of the Starry Sept, and the exhortations of the Seven Speakers had won over most of the Faithful for Jaehaerys and his Alysanne\u2026but there are always some who will not be moved, and amongst the sisters who tended Jonquil\u2019s Pool were three such women, whose hearts were hard with hate. They told one another that their holy waters would be polluted forever were the queen allowed to bathe in them whilst carrying the king\u2019s \u201cabomination\u201d in her belly. Queen Alysanne had only slipped out of her clothing when they fell upon her with daggers they had concealed within their robes.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/046780d6b5481ebec3d1cab36d3f039b/tumblr_inline_pkfcywxDL61scj86c_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"397\" data-orig-height=\"600\"></figure><p>Her ladies-in-waiting foiled the attempt on Alysanne and the two Kings Guards assigned to her. \u00a0However, it also forced her and Jaehaerys to end their progress and return to Kings Landing.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as the Serpent in Scarlet. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King\u2019s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen\u2019s own sworn shield. In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><p>So we have Alysanne who Martin has written to parallel Sansa in so many ways arriving at Maidenpool from Duskendale. \u00a0Then after visiting Jonquil\u2019s pool where she is attacked, she sends to Duskendale for her own personal female guard. \u00a0One that just happens to be named Jonquil and quite possibly may have been a redhead</p><p>Also, let\u2019s not forget that Brienne goes searching for Sansa, the in-story symbolic stand-in for Jonquil in Duskendale. \u00a0When she has no luck there she heads over to Maidenpool where Lord Tarly is now in control.</p><blockquote><p>\"If the Stark girl were here, I\u2019d know it. She\u2019s run back north, I\u2019ll wager. Hoping to find refuge with one of her father\u2019s bannermen. She had best hope she chooses the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<b>She might have gone to the Vale instead</b>,\u201d Brienne heard herself blurt out, \u201cto her mother\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Lord Randyll gave her a contemptuous look. \u201cLady Lysa is dead. Some singer pushed her off a mountain. Littlefinger holds the Eyrie now \u2026 though not for long. The lords of the Vale are not the sort to bend their knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.\u201d </p><p><b>A Feast for Crows - Brienne III</b></p></blockquote><p>Brienne should have trusted her instincts because Sansa is of course in the Vale. \u00a0The interesting thing about the Vale is that it was the planned final destination of the royal progress and it was the next stop after Maidenpool. \u00a0The attack on Alysanne\u2019s forced the King and Queen returned to Kings Landing, making plans to visit the Vale at a future date. \u00a0As I mentioned previously, if Sansa had travelled to the Vale overland instead of via water, she would have followed the same path as Alysanne and Jaehaerys.</p><p>With all these symbolic Jonquils connected to or traveling from Duskendale to Maidenpool to the Vale, is it possible that the original followed the same path? \u00a0Is it possible that she was from Duskendale and she only stopped in Maidenpool on the way to her final destination in the Vale? \u00a0Or is the reverse true and she was traveling from the Vale to Duskendale and only stopped in Maidenpool to rest. \u00a0With Sansa\u2019s symbolic connection to all three areas, I believe that one of these options is true and it is what George wants us to consider. \u00a0And if we can figure out which one is correct, we may be one step closer to answering the great mystery of the series.</p><p>We have reviewed the many clues that suggest that Jonquil was a \u201ckissed by fire\u201d redhead and briefly looked at hints that she was also short in stature. \u00a0All of the females that I mentioned who tip to Jonquil having red hair were described as short or at least it was intimated that they were. \u00a0Let\u2019s now look at one other scene with Dunk, the Florian that supports my thesis that she was short. \u00a0It\u2019s a memory that occurs to Dunk just after he speaks to Tanselle, the Jonquil surrogate for the first time. </p><blockquote><p>\u201cWill you drink a horn of ale?\u201d he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. \u201cWith me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They\u2019re made with pork, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, m'lord, but we have another show.\u201d The girl rose, and ran off to the fierce fat Dornishwoman who worked the puppet knight while Dunk stood there feeling stupid. He liked the way she ran, though. A pretty girl, and tall. I would not have to kneel to kiss that one. <b>He knew how to kiss</b>.</p><p>A tavern girl had showed him one night in Lannisport, a year ago, <b>but she\u2019d been so short she had to sit on the table to reach his lips</b>. The memory made his ears burn. <b>What a great fool he was</b>. It was jousting he should be thinking about, not kissing.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>Why did Martin make the girl of Dunk\u2019s memory so short in height if it was not to hint at something? \u00a0As the memory of her comes to him just after he has seen the puppet show about Florian and Jonquil and his brief conversation with Tanselle, it\u2019s quite possible that it\u2019s a clue to Jonquil\u2019s height. \u00a0At the same time, Martin also has Dunk mentally call himself a fool so that we the reader can link him to Florian and a short female. \u00a0</p><p>The fact that George keeps hinting at her being short in stature must mean that it is of some importance to the story. \u00a0I think that Jonquil\u2019s height is in fact of extreme consequence, as we will discover a bit later in the essay series.</p><p>One final point I want to mention about Dunk\u2019s brief conversation with Tanselle is his invitation for her to go and have a horn of ale and a pork sausage with him. \u00a0Dunk is an innocent but we the readers know that horns and sausages\u2026especially the pork kind comes with all sorts of sexual innuendos. \u00a0And so we see again how the fertility theme is constantly running through the Florian and Jonquil arc. \u00a0</p><p>This brings us to the end of part 3. \u00a0In the next chapter, sausages come into play again as we look at a curious textural error in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and ponder whether it was a mistake or if it was a deliberate on Martin\u2019s part. \u00a0And we also take a look at Mary Magdalene because if they are suggestions of a symbolic Christ in the story one would expect some hints of Mary Magdalene as well. It turns out that there quite possibly are such clues and in a most surprising way.</p><p>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181786342706/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She&rsquo;d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous &hellip; but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the <b>red</b>-<b>haired</b> girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, <b>Dunk shook his head and walked away</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I find this scene with the whore very interesting as I think it might have been the inspiration for Dan and Dave&rsquo;s creation of Roz on the show. &nbsp;And like Jon did with Roz, Dunk, rejects the red-haired whore. &nbsp;</p><p>However, like Jon with Ygritte, we later see that Dunk definitely has a thing for redheads when he encounters Rohanne Weber in <i>The Sworn Sword</i>. &nbsp;We will talk a little bit more about both Rohanne and Ygritte later in the essay but for now, I just want to discuss the similarities in their description to each other as well as to the red-hair whore that Dunk sees.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;And what is all this merriment?&rdquo; The voice cut through the laughter, cool and firm. &ldquo;Will no one share the jape? Ser knight, why are you troubling my good-sister?&rdquo;</p><p>It was the girl he had seen earlier at the archery butts. She had a quiver of arrows on one hip, and held a longbow that was just as tall as she was, which wasn&rsquo;t very tall. <b>If Dunk was shy an inch of seven feet, the archer was shy an inch of five</b>. He could have spanned her waist with his two hands. <b>Her red hair was bound up in a braid so long it brushed past her thighs, and she had a dimpled chin, a snub nose, and a light spray of freckles across her cheeks</b>.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>Forgive us, Lady Rohanne</b>.&rdquo; The speaker was a pretty young lord with the Caswell centaur embroidered on his doublet. &ldquo;This great oaf took the Lady Helicent for you.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>And here are a couple of descriptions of Ygritte. &nbsp;Make note of the similarities between the three and keep in mind that like Lady Rohanne, Ygritte was also an archer.</p><blockquote><p>Ygritte watched and said nothing. She was older than he&rsquo;d thought at first, Jon realized; maybe as old as twenty, <b>but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, and a pug nose. Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions.</b> She looked plump as she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather. Underneath all that she could be as skinny as Arya.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Jon VI</b></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We should.&rdquo; <b>Her breasts bounced</b> as she stood on one leg to pull one boot, then hopped onto her other foot to attend to the other. Her nipples were wide pink circles. &ldquo;You as well,&rdquo; Ygritte said as she yanked down her sheepskin breeches. &ldquo;If you want to look you have to show. You know nothing, Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Storm of Swords - Jon III</b></p></blockquote><p>All three women are of course redheads. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure of the importance of the bouncy breasts&hellip;maybe just George remembering someone in his personal life. &nbsp;Who knows! &nbsp;Ygritte and the redhead whore are the ones described as having bouncy breast&mdash;not Rohanne. &nbsp;In fact, as we see from this Dunk dream sequence, Rohanne&rsquo;s breasts were most likely pretty small.</p><blockquote><p>Drowsing at long last, Dunk dreamed. He was running through a glade in the heart of Wat&rsquo;s Wood, running toward Rohanne, and she was shooting arrows at him. Each shaft she loosed flew true, and pierced him through the chest, yet the pain was strangely sweet. He should have turned and fled, but he ran toward her instead, running slowly as you always did in dreams, as if the very air had turned to honey. Another arrow came, and yet another. Her quiver seemed to have no end of shafts. Her eyes were gray and green and full of mischief. Your gown brings out the color of your eyes, he meant to say to her, but she was not wearing any gown, or any clothes at all. <b>Across her small breasts was a faint spray of freckles, and her nipples were red and hard as little berries.</b> The arrows made him look like some great porcupine as he went stumbling to her feet, but somehow he still found the strength to grab her braid.</p><p>With one hard yank he pulled her down on top of him and kissed her.</p><p>He woke suddenly, at the sound of a shout.</p><p><b>The Sworn Sword</b></p></blockquote><p>Rohanne and Ygritte are also described as short and while the height of the whore walking through the crowds is not given, it is not a ridiculous assumption to assume that she was as well. &nbsp;Dunk was almost 7 feet and so he would have no problem seeing a shorter person in a crowd. &nbsp;I think the most important things to note about them are their height, red hair, freckles on their faces and archery skills of two of the three.</p><p>There is another redhead in the books whose description is intriguingly similar to these three women. &nbsp;And like the redhead Dunk saw at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, she is also a whore.</p><blockquote><p>\"Is milord feeling unloved?&rdquo; Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. &ldquo;I have a cure for that.&rdquo;</p><p>Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. &ldquo;You are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I&rsquo;ve grown fond of Alayaya&rsquo;s remedy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never tried mine. Milord never chooses anyone but &lsquo;Yaya. She&rsquo;s good but I&rsquo;m better, don&rsquo;t you want to see?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Next time, perhaps.&rdquo; Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. <b>She was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist</b>. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse.</p><p><b>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion VII</b></p></blockquote><p>Dancy&rsquo;s height is not given but based on how she is described as sitting on Tyrion&rsquo;s lap, one can probably deduce that she is not too tall or else Tyrion&rsquo;s mental thoughts would have filled us in. &nbsp;Again we get the bouncy reference but I am not even going to attempt to analyze GRRM&rsquo;s psyche or why he describes the whores and Ygritte, a Wilding girl in this manner but Lady Rohanne as having the more refined small breast.</p><p>There is also another redheaded whore that I want to point out. &nbsp;This one appears in the scene when Arya hears the summoning bells that lead her to seeing her father beheaded. &nbsp;While George does not use the word bouncy, you can see from the description of her breast that he is following the same theme.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bells again, gods ha'mercy,&rdquo; wailed an old woman.</p><p><b>A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window</b>. &ldquo;Is it the boy king that&rsquo;s died now?&rdquo; she shouted down, leaning out over the street. &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a boy for you, they never last long.&rdquo; As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift.</p><p>&ldquo;Stupid slut,&rdquo; the fat man shouted up. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s not dead, that&rsquo;s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.&rdquo;</p><p><b>A Game of Thrones - Arya V </b> </p></blockquote><p>George wants us to think of Dunk as the symbolic Florian. &nbsp;He even goes so far to have him and Tanselle role play a scene from the song of Florian and Jonquil to push the point home. &nbsp;Dunk also plays Florian in his travels throughout the land as a hedge knight and so we must look to the women he encounters for clues of Jonquil. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You must think me an utter fool.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled. &ldquo;All men are fools, and all men are knights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What color paint do you have?&rdquo; he asked, hoping that might give him an idea.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight </b></p></blockquote><p>If we take the descriptions of Lady Rohanne and the whore in the crowd as clues to Jonquil then we also need to look at the various redheads throughout the books to see whether we can find more clues representative of Jonquil. &nbsp;We can see from the descriptions of the redheads that I&rsquo;ve mentioned that she was most likely also short with freckles. &nbsp;Then of course there is the implication that she was a prostitute. &nbsp;</p><p>Except for the fact that she is a redhead, on first reading, none of these descriptions fit Sansa, the symbolic Jonquil in the story proper. &nbsp;She is not short, does not have freckles and is of course not a whore. &nbsp;However, she is connected to the world of prostitution via the fact that Petyr, the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of her Alayne persona is a brothel owner who turned her best friend Jeyne into a whore before selling her to the Boltons as an Arya stand-in. &nbsp;And as I will show a little later, the theme of shortness and freckles come into play in her story as well.</p><p>Now the fact that both Dunk and Jon have a thing for redheads and that several appear in their story arcs does not mean Jonquil was one as well. &nbsp;In point of fact, a big part of my theory about her being a redhead has to do with Maidenpool and Duskendale.</p><p>The whore is not the only encounter Dunk has with a redhead at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows. &nbsp;The other encounters are with males&mdash;Ser Donnel, a knight of the King&rsquo;s Guard and Ser Manfred of House Dondarrion who like his descendent, Beric also has red gold hair. &nbsp;And these individuals also point at the likelihood that Jonquil was a redhead. &nbsp;This is especially true of Ser Donnel.</p><blockquote><p>By the time Dunk left the stable, Lord Ashford had escorted his princely guests into the hail, but two of the Kingsguard knights in their white armor and snowy cloaks still lingered in the yard, talking with the captain of the guard. Dunk halted before them. &ldquo;M'lords, I am Ser Duncan the Tall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well met, Ser Duncan,&rdquo; answered the bigger of the white knights. &ldquo;I am Ser Roland Crakehall, and this is my Sworn Brother, <b>Ser Donnel of Duskendale</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>The seven champions of the Kingsguard were the most puissant warriors in all the Seven Kingdoms, saving only perhaps the crown prince, Baelor Breakspear himself. &ldquo;Have you come to enter the lists?&rdquo; Dunk asked anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;It would not be fitting for us to ride against those we are sworn to protect,&rdquo; answered <b>Ser Donnel, red of hair and beard</b>.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>As I&rsquo;ve been working under the theory that Jonquil was a redhead, I found Ser Donnel&rsquo;s red hair to be an interesting detail because he is from Duskendale and as I mentioned above, it borders Maidenpool. &nbsp;Something told me that point was important but there was no other detail given about him and his House was not mentioned in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and so I had to leave it alone. &nbsp;That is until we first became aware of Jonquil Darke, the sworn shield of Good Queen Alysanne as revealed in the excerpt of <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> George posted on his website in advance of the book&rsquo;s release.</p><blockquote><p>Lord Manderly entertained the queen lavishly. At the welcoming feast an entire aurochs was roasted, and his lordship&rsquo;s daughter Jessamyn acted as the queen&rsquo;s cupbearer, filling her tankard with a strong northern ale that Her Grace pronounced finer than any wine she had ever tasted. Manderly also staged a small tourney in the queen&rsquo;s honor, to show the prowess of his knights. One of the fighters (though no knight) was revealed to be a woman, a wildling girl who had been captured by rangers north of the Wall and given to one of Lord Manderly&rsquo;s household knights to foster. Delighted by the girl&rsquo;s daring, Alysanne summoned her own sworn shield, <b>Jonquil Darke, and the wildling and the Scarlet Shadow dueled spear against sword</b> whilst the northmen roared in approval.</p><p><b>Fire &amp; Blood: Jaehaerys and Alysanne - Their Triumphs and Tragedies</b><b> </b></p></blockquote><p>Jonquil Darke also had something in common with Sansa Stark in that she was a bastard daughter. &nbsp;In the case of the Scarlet Shadow, her father was the Lord of Duskendale. &nbsp;Sansa is of course only pretending while Jonquil Darke was a true bastard but it is interesting that both are associated with the word. &nbsp;Does this mean that the original Jonquil was also a bastard? &nbsp;Yes, but not quite in the way you may think, as we will soon discover.</p><p>There is a ton of symbolism associated with the name of Jonquil Darke, which I will be discussing when I get to the section dedicated specifically to the character. &nbsp;For now, let&rsquo;s discuss how and why she came by her Scarlet Shadow sobriquet. &nbsp;</p><p>The shadow part of her moniker is because once she became Alysanne&rsquo;s personal guard, she never left her side. &nbsp;When you saw the queen, Jonquil was always a step behind her. &nbsp;She became Alysanne&rsquo;s figurative shadow.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as <b>the Serpent in Scarlet</b>. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King&rsquo;s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen&rsquo;s own sworn shield. <b>In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow</b>, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>The scarlet sobriquet was because she always dressed in red. &nbsp;Was this because red was the color of her House sigil? Quite possible! &nbsp;Might she have had red hair as well? &nbsp;This is also possible, as redheads seem to be very common in the Maidenpool/Duskendale area. &nbsp;</p><p>Red hair is a result of a recessive gene that occurs in only about 2% of the world&rsquo;s population. &nbsp;I know that we are dealing with a fantasy series but still in all, even with all the fantastical elements, George tends to stay within scientific norms. &nbsp;For this reason, I would argue that the number of redheads referenced in the books from the Duskendale/Maidenpool area are numerically out of the statistical mean and like with the ones in attendance at the Tourney of Ashford Meadows, it is meant to draw attention to Jonquil.</p><p>We can deduce from the legend of Florian the Brave, which I mentioned in <a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-flo\" target=\"_blank\"><b>part 1</b></a><b> </b>of this series that on a Doylist level, Martin named the family members of the area houses after the famous original pair. &nbsp;This makes sense on a Watsonian level as well since the Lords and Ladies of the said houses would also be inclined to name their progeny after such a storied pair. &nbsp;</p><p>House Darke is a cadet branch of House Darklyn, which gives it a connection to the Duskendale/Maidenpool area. &nbsp;This could explain why the Scarlet Shadow was given the name of Jonquil. &nbsp;It also suggests that George wants the reader to associate and compare her and her background with the original Jonquil and so that is just what we will do.</p><p>She is known as the Scarlet Shadow and this moniker gave me my connection to Ser Donnel who is from the Duskendale area and whom I now propose was also a member of House Darklyn. &nbsp;And while this does not have to be the case, one can&rsquo;t help but presupposed that the scarlet in her moniker is also in reference to her hair and she like Ser Donnel was a redhead. &nbsp;</p><p>Not much is know about other members of House Darke or Darklyn except that they supported the blacks during the Dance with Dragons and that several sons were members of the Kings and Queens guard. &nbsp;This included 7 sons of House Darklyn who were Kingsguard members and one Ser Harrold of House Darke who was a member of the Queen Rhaenrya&rsquo;s guard during the Dance of Dragons. &nbsp;And we now know that a Jonquil Darke was a member of Queen Alysanne&rsquo;s guard. &nbsp;It is interesting that the Darklyns protected the kings while the Darkes seem to have done the same for the queens. &nbsp;There is probably a story there and maybe we will find out when<i> The Winds of Winter</i> is released.</p><p>The other interesting story about House Darklyn is of the Defiance of Duskendale which led to the then Lord of the House kidnapping King Aerys and his imprisoning him in a dark dungeon for half a year, which no doubt contributed to his already growing madness. &nbsp;After Ser Barristan Selmy rescued him, Aerys had all members of House Darklyn and almost all of those from House Hollard, who supported the defiance killed. &nbsp;The only family member of either house to survive was a young son of House Hollard. &nbsp;Ser Barristan begged for his life and because Aerys owed him a debt for rescuing him from the dungeon, he granted the boon. &nbsp;</p><p>Ser Barristan took the boy back to Kings Landing with him as his squire. &nbsp;This lad was of course Dontos Hollard who grew up to be Sansa Stark&rsquo;s symbolic Florian. &nbsp;A sad and poor version of the legendary knight was Dontos. &nbsp; He was only in it for the money but he did help her escape from Kings Landing and did teach her some valuable lessons about the game of thrones. &nbsp;With Dontos, Sansa&rsquo;s pretend Florian being from Duskendale; we see again how heavily her arc is tied up with the past events from that area as well as Maidenpool region.</p><p>The color of Dontos hair is never given in the text but an interesting detail about him that is not often mentioned is that he is also called &ldquo;Dontos the Red.&rdquo; &nbsp;Why he has this moniker is never stated. &nbsp;It may have something to do with his alcoholism and him possibly always being red of face. &nbsp;However, with the preponderance of redheads from the Duskendale area, more than likely the moniker pertains to his hair color. &nbsp;This is especially true as Dontos; the Red makes one immediately think of the famous Viking, Erik, the Red who was so named because of his red hair and beard.</p><p>Kiss by fire redheads are part of a very important and mysterious theme in the books. &nbsp;If Dontos is a redhead as I speculate, then here we have another scarlet hair individual from Duskendale. &nbsp;This is quite a lot of references to redheaded individuals from an area that ostensibly have nothing to do with the central story. &nbsp;And yet, the tale of Duskendale and past events that happened there are referenced in all the books except for <i>A Game of Thrones</i>. &nbsp;This includes the ancillary Dunk and Egg novellas. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;</p><p>Why does it play such a major role in the arc of Sansa Stark? &nbsp;She has actually never visited Duskendale as she went directly to the Vale after escaping from Kings Landing. &nbsp;However, if she had traveled by land, she most likely would have travel through Duskendale on the way to the Vale. &nbsp;But that was not her escape route. &nbsp;Instead, she went by ship and so sailed directly to the Fingers. &nbsp;Nonetheless, she is still strongly associated with the area as Dontos is from the region and it is where Brienne went in search of him and the missing Sansa.</p><p>Florian of course first saw Jonquil at Maidenpool, which as I&rsquo;ve previously noted, borders Duskendale. &nbsp;@RoseOfRedLake has a wonderful <a href=\"http://rose-of-red-lake\" target=\"_blank\">essay</a><b> </b>about the importance of Maidenpool and the role it has played in the story so far and potentially may in the future. &nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s because Duskendale neighbors Maidenpool that it is featured so prominently in the books. &nbsp;That could be part of the reason but maybe there is more to it.</p><p>I wondered earlier whether Jonquil was from Maidenpool or if she was just visiting the pool on her way to another location. &nbsp;As luck would have it, George has provided several hints in <i>Fire and Blood</i> that it may be the second option. </p><p>While on a royal progress with Jaehaerys, Alysanne decided to visit Jonquil&rsquo;s healing pool for a bath. &nbsp;One interesting aspect of her visit is the fact prior to arriving in Maidenpool the couple visited Duskendale.</p><blockquote><p>They began with Stokeworth and Rosby, then moved north along the coast to Duskendale. &nbsp;There, whilst the king viewed Lord Darklyn&rsquo;s boatyards and enjoyed an afternoon of fishing, the queen held the first of her women&rsquo;s courts, which were to become an important part of every royal progress to come. Only women and girls were welcome at these audiences; highborn or low, they were encouraged to come forward and share their fears, concerns, and hopes with the young queen.</p><p>The journey went without incident until the king and queen reached Maidenpool, where they were to be the guests of Lord and Lady Mooton for a fortnight before sailing across the Bay of Crabs to Wickenden, Gulltown, and the Vale.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal under King Jaehaerys 1</b></p></blockquote><p>Before arriving in Maidenpool, the royal progress may have stopped at Antlers or Rook&rsquo;s Rest. &nbsp;However, they could have travel directly from Duskendale to Maidenpool without a stop in-between. &nbsp;As they were traveling along the coast, it would have been more likely that they stopped at Rook&rsquo;s Rest as opposed to Antlers but as it was a progress, they most likely stopped in both areas. &nbsp;</p><p>However, unlike with the mention of Stokeworth and Rosby, George makes no mention of these other two towns. &nbsp;The text goes straight from Jaehaerys and Alysanne being in Duskendale to them in Maidenpool. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s almost as if George wants you to associate the two towns with each other. &nbsp;This is something he does on numerous occasions throughout the various books as the towns are often grouped together&hellip;almost as a unit. &nbsp;</p><p>I proposed that the reason for this is because Jonquil in point of fact was not from Maidenpool as many assume. &nbsp;Maidenpool is the location of the famous pool where Florian first saw Jonquil but nowhere does it say that it was the location of her birth. &nbsp;Instead, I believe Florian first saw her there simply because like Alysanne, her and her party stop there to rest and refresh themselves in the local pool. &nbsp;I think that it&rsquo;s possible that she was either from Duskendale or had family who resided there that she was visiting. &nbsp;</p><p>As Jonquil was familiar with Florian&rsquo;s name, he might have been from the region as well. &nbsp;And I think that this could be why Duskendale and Maidenpool are always linked in the text.</p><blockquote><p>This morning the puppeteers were doing the tale of Florian and Jonquil. The fat Dornishwoman was working Florian in his armor made of motley, while the tall girl held Jonquil&rsquo;s strings. &ldquo;You are no knight,&rdquo; she was saying as the puppet&rsquo;s mouth moved up and down. &ldquo;<b>I know you. You are Florian the Fool</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, my lady,&rdquo; the other puppet answered, kneeling. &ldquo;As great a fool as ever lived, and as great a knight as well.&rdquo;</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>I mentioned that Jonquil might possibly have been from Duskendale or had family in the region. &nbsp;However, there is one other area from which she might have been born. There are many hints in <i>Fire &amp; Blood</i> that suggest that Alysanne&rsquo;s story offer clues to that of Sansa. &nbsp;And I think that one of the ways it does this is with the story of Florian and Jonquil. &nbsp;</p><p>Jaehaerys and Alysanne arrived in Maidenpool from Duskendale only for the queen to be attacked when she visited Jonquil&rsquo;s pool.</p><blockquote><p>The goodness of the little queen, the silence of the Starry Sept, and the exhortations of the Seven Speakers had won over most of the Faithful for Jaehaerys and his Alysanne&hellip;but there are always some who will not be moved, and amongst the sisters who tended Jonquil&rsquo;s Pool were three such women, whose hearts were hard with hate. They told one another that their holy waters would be polluted forever were the queen allowed to bathe in them whilst carrying the king&rsquo;s &ldquo;abomination&rdquo; in her belly. Queen Alysanne had only slipped out of her clothing when they fell upon her with daggers they had concealed within their robes.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/046780d6b5481ebec3d1cab36d3f039b/tumblr_inline_pkfcywxDL61scj86c_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Her ladies-in-waiting foiled the attempt on Alysanne and the two Kings Guards assigned to her. &nbsp;However, it also forced her and Jaehaerys to end their progress and return to Kings Landing.</p><blockquote><p>A raven flew to Duskendale that very night, commanding the new Lord Darklyn to send to court his bastard half-sister, Jonquil Darke, who had thrilled the smallfolk during the War for the White Cloaks as the mystery knight known as the Serpent in Scarlet. Still in scarlet, she arrived at King&rsquo;s Landing a few days later, and gladly accepted appointment as the queen&rsquo;s own sworn shield. In time, she would be known about the realm as the Scarlet Shadow, so closely did she guard her lady.</p><p><b>Fire and Blood: Birth, Death and Betrayal Under King Jaehaerys I</b></p></blockquote><p>So we have Alysanne who Martin has written to parallel Sansa in so many ways arriving at Maidenpool from Duskendale. &nbsp;Then after visiting Jonquil&rsquo;s pool where she is attacked, she sends to Duskendale for her own personal female guard. &nbsp;One that just happens to be named Jonquil and quite possibly may have been a redhead</p><p>Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that Brienne goes searching for Sansa, the in-story symbolic stand-in for Jonquil in Duskendale. &nbsp;When she has no luck there she heads over to Maidenpool where Lord Tarly is now in control.</p><blockquote><p>\"If the Stark girl were here, I&rsquo;d know it. She&rsquo;s run back north, I&rsquo;ll wager. Hoping to find refuge with one of her father&rsquo;s bannermen. She had best hope she chooses the right one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<b>She might have gone to the Vale instead</b>,&rdquo; Brienne heard herself blurt out, &ldquo;to her mother&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p><p>Lord Randyll gave her a contemptuous look. &ldquo;Lady Lysa is dead. Some singer pushed her off a mountain. Littlefinger holds the Eyrie now &hellip; though not for long. The lords of the Vale are not the sort to bend their knees to some upjumped jackanapes whose only skill is counting coppers.&rdquo; </p><p><b>A Feast for Crows - Brienne III</b></p></blockquote><p>Brienne should have trusted her instincts because Sansa is of course in the Vale. &nbsp;The interesting thing about the Vale is that it was the planned final destination of the royal progress and it was the next stop after Maidenpool. &nbsp;The attack on Alysanne&rsquo;s forced the King and Queen returned to Kings Landing, making plans to visit the Vale at a future date. &nbsp;As I mentioned previously, if Sansa had travelled to the Vale overland instead of via water, she would have followed the same path as Alysanne and Jaehaerys.</p><p>With all these symbolic Jonquils connected to or traveling from Duskendale to Maidenpool to the Vale, is it possible that the original followed the same path? &nbsp;Is it possible that she was from Duskendale and she only stopped in Maidenpool on the way to her final destination in the Vale? &nbsp;Or is the reverse true and she was traveling from the Vale to Duskendale and only stopped in Maidenpool to rest. &nbsp;With Sansa&rsquo;s symbolic connection to all three areas, I believe that one of these options is true and it is what George wants us to consider. &nbsp;And if we can figure out which one is correct, we may be one step closer to answering the great mystery of the series.</p><p>We have reviewed the many clues that suggest that Jonquil was a &ldquo;kissed by fire&rdquo; redhead and briefly looked at hints that she was also short in stature. &nbsp;All of the females that I mentioned who tip to Jonquil having red hair were described as short or at least it was intimated that they were. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s now look at one other scene with Dunk, the Florian that supports my thesis that she was short. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a memory that occurs to Dunk just after he speaks to Tanselle, the Jonquil surrogate for the first time. </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Will you drink a horn of ale?&rdquo; he asked the puppet girl as she was scooping the sawdust blood back into her dragon. &ldquo;With me, I mean? Or a sausage? I had a sausage last night, and it was good. They&rsquo;re made with pork, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, m'lord, but we have another show.&rdquo; The girl rose, and ran off to the fierce fat Dornishwoman who worked the puppet knight while Dunk stood there feeling stupid. He liked the way she ran, though. A pretty girl, and tall. I would not have to kneel to kiss that one. <b>He knew how to kiss</b>.</p><p>A tavern girl had showed him one night in Lannisport, a year ago, <b>but she&rsquo;d been so short she had to sit on the table to reach his lips</b>. The memory made his ears burn. <b>What a great fool he was</b>. It was jousting he should be thinking about, not kissing.</p><p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p></blockquote><p>Why did Martin make the girl of Dunk&rsquo;s memory so short in height if it was not to hint at something? &nbsp;As the memory of her comes to him just after he has seen the puppet show about Florian and Jonquil and his brief conversation with Tanselle, it&rsquo;s quite possible that it&rsquo;s a clue to Jonquil&rsquo;s height. &nbsp;At the same time, Martin also has Dunk mentally call himself a fool so that we the reader can link him to Florian and a short female. &nbsp;</p><p>The fact that George keeps hinting at her being short in stature must mean that it is of some importance to the story. &nbsp;I think that Jonquil&rsquo;s height is in fact of extreme consequence, as we will discover a bit later in the essay series.</p><p>One final point I want to mention about Dunk&rsquo;s brief conversation with Tanselle is his invitation for her to go and have a horn of ale and a pork sausage with him. &nbsp;Dunk is an innocent but we the readers know that horns and sausages&hellip;especially the pork kind comes with all sorts of sexual innuendos. &nbsp;And so we see again how the fertility theme is constantly running through the Florian and Jonquil arc. &nbsp;</p><p>This brings us to the end of part 3. &nbsp;In the next chapter, sausages come into play again as we look at a curious textural error in <i>The Hedge Knight</i> and ponder whether it was a mistake or if it was a deliberate on Martin&rsquo;s part. &nbsp;And we also take a look at Mary Magdalene because if they are suggestions of a symbolic Christ in the story one would expect some hints of Mary Magdalene as well. It turns out that there quite possibly are such clues and in a most surprising way.</p><p>You may read the other chapters of this essay at the following links.</p><p><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181032507846/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Part 1</b></a></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181307773574/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/181786342706/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part\" target=\"_blank\">Part 4</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/182073868586/secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-5-symbolism-of-j\" target=\"_blank\">Part 5</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://stormcloudrising.tumblr.com/post/183345915701/the-secret-song-of-florian-and-jonquil-part-6\" target=\"_blank\">Part 6</a></b></p>",

He thought of the silver in his pouch. I could have her, if I liked. She&rsquo;d like the clink of my coin well enough, I could take her back to my camp and have her, all night if I wanted. He had never lain with a woman, and for all he knew he might die in his first tilt. Tourneys could be dangerous &hellip; but whores could be dangerous too, the old man had warned him of that. She might rob me while I slept, and what would I do then? When the <b>red</b>-<b>haired</b> girl glanced back over her shoulder at him, <b>Dunk shook his head and walked away</b>.</p>\n<p><b>The Hedge Knight</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find this scene with the whore very interesting as I think it might have been the inspiration for Dan and Dave&rsquo;s creation of Roz on the show. &nbsp;And like Jon did with Roz, Dunk, rejects the red-haired whore. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, like Jon with Ygritte, we later see that Dunk definitely has a thing for redheads when he encounters Rohanne Weber in <i>The Sworn Sword</i>. &nbsp;We will talk a little bit more about both Rohanne and Ygritte later in the essay but for now, I just want to discuss the similarities in their description to each other as well as to the red-hair whore that Dunk sees.</p>\n</p>",
