To be honest I don\u2019t have a set opinion about the coming out scene since I wanna see how it plays out. But I\u2019ve been thinking and I think that the ending of this season is going to be the most&hellip;.liberating? The biggest victory? Something like that. Hear me out.</p><p>Lucas seems like the angriest and loneliest version of Isak and this episode was much sadder and heartbreaking than the og in my opinion (not shading the og, it\u2019ll always be that bitch and the best in my heart). Especially since the coming out scene with Jonas was Isaks hope and his light after all that shit. But Lucas feels like he has no one, life is fucking shitting on him. It seems like it won\u2019t ever get better and he\u2019s probably drowning in self hate and all that shit. No matter what your situation is, a lot of people feel like that, like there\u2019s no light at the end of the tunnel and that it won\u2019t ever get better. </p><p>But we all know that in the end Lucas will be the happiest boy and have his boyfriend and his friends and found family. We know that he finds the light at the end of the tunnel and is finally happy and free. Love always wins. Which is why it\u2019ll be the most satisfying and liberating because it seemed so hopeless but in the end there was light at the end of his seemingly endless and terrifying tunnel. He will get through the horrible pain he\u2019s going through and that\u2019s so inspiring to so many people. So many people feel hopeless, like they\u2019re life has no purpose and that they\u2019re gonna suffer forever. But in reality they won\u2019t suffer forever and Lucas\u2019 story will prove that. Isaks and Martinos did too, it\u2019s just that this one hurts more. This story just shows more pain, which could be better or worse, it\u2019s all up to opinion.</p><p>I hate that Lucas is going through this, I wish he had the happy coming out scene but I\u2019m positive that in the end it\u2019ll be the most rewarding and relieving when he\u2019s happy and is surrounded by love. It gives me hope as well that even though me and Lucas are not going through the same things, that no matter how bad things are and no matter how much pain I\u2019m in, it won\u2019t last forever and you will find hope and happiness. Because no sadness will last forever and everyone needs to know that.</p><p>So yeah this is messy and all over the place and probably no one will understand and y\u2019all will probably disagree but I just wanted to say this. </p>",

Slowly opening the door, the first thing he sees is Yann sitting\nin the sofa, his leg jumping up and down &ndash; he was stressed, maybe nervous. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; He can see Manon in the corner of\nhis eye, but he doesn&rsquo;t take his eyes off Yann. Yann stands up. &ldquo;Lucas!&rdquo; He\nlooks perplexed, then he gives Manon a look; she leaves. &ldquo;I need to talk to you&rdquo;\nhis voice is soft, and Lucas relaxes. &ldquo;So I hear.&rdquo; Yann opens his mouth and\ncloses it a couple times, trying to find the right words. &ldquo;I screwed up.&rdquo; Lucas\nlets out a laugh as he breaks the eye contact and crosses his arms over his\nchest. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have left you like that, Lucas. You opened up to me and I just\nwalked away, and for that I&rsquo;m so sorry, man. I- I really don&rsquo;t have a good\nenough excuse. It was petty of me, I-&hellip; I had ben worried about you for weeks\nand I told you that I&rsquo;d be there for you if you wanted to talk, and then you\nfinally wanted to confide in me, and I was relieved. And&hellip; then you say that you&rsquo;d\ntalked to other people about what&rsquo;s going on, and I just&hellip; ugh it&rsquo;s horrible, I&rsquo;m\nso sorry man, you came out to me and I was suddenly mad that you had told\nothers before me, which you absolutely have a right to! But I was just really stupid\ndude, I&rsquo;m sorry-&rdquo; Yann rambled on, &ldquo;And then I realized that you might think\nthat I ran off because I was mad about you being gay or something, and then I realized\nhow selfish I was, because this isn&rsquo;t about me, and I am glad that you did have\nsomeone to confide in, even though it wasn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo; Lucas couldn&rsquo;t hide his\nrelief. Yanns eyes were filled with tears now, he smiled- &ldquo;You are my best\nfriend Lucas, and I&rsquo;m here for you, always.&rdquo; Lucas walked into Yanns arms\nbefore he could see his tears fall down. They hugged for what felt like hours,\nbut he truly felt like he could stay there for hours more.</p><p>Yann later broke the hug and laid a hand on each of\nLucas&rsquo; shoulders, he looked into his eyes with a serious expression, as if his\neyes weren&rsquo;t drenched in tears, </p><p>&ldquo;so&hellip; Eliott, eh? He&rsquo;s kind of cute&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Shut up.&rdquo;</p>",

Relationships and Lilo don&rsquo;t work well. LILO can nothing with relationships. LILO has had multiple relationships. 1 of 2 years. And a few short relationships. But with every relationship there was rejection. LILO had given up hope. Until Lilo Carrie met on 10 March. LILO is hardly remembered of that evening. However, Lilo the face of Carrie. Carrie made something in Lilo. LILO and Carrie see each other a long time. When Lilo and Carrie each other see it is not the right time. LILO is a fragile relationship. A relationship that can go out any time. Her friend always has comments. LILO does not feel loved.It is 26 October when Lilo and Carrie see each other again. LILO and Carrie are included in the same LGBT group. A Christian. There is talk that night evening. LILO is there with her friend and her best friend. He knows already what Lilo longer.

Yet when the two kissing Lilo feels nothing. Her friend notices. LILO sees how Carrie looks at Lilo. There is clearly more from the side of Carrie. LILO let it go. But when Lilo with her friends in the rain runs and Carrie runs next to her. LILO can&rsquo;t look away. Carrie draws more and more the attention of Lilo. It was the 8th of december. 8 december saw Carrie and Lilo meet again. LILO was not very stable. The winter months were always very debilitating for Lilo. LILO was more sensitive to emotions. Pulled the very long days. The period around the holidays were never the favorite days of Lilo. LILO and Carrie would only agree. That did not happen. The girlfriend of Lilo came between. Lilo knew that Carrie accepted that lilo. However, more for Lilo felt. When Lilo and Carrie get the chance to talk only word everything clear for Lilo. All the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Yet are looking for Lilo to a stable relationship. A relationship where lilo now in it. However, that relationship of short duration. A week later break Lilo and her friend the relationship. The excuse. LILO and her friend to have few things in common. With Christmas is Lilo alone. With old and new hits Lilo again depressed and this time it takes 3 weeks to come on top.

LILO asks carrie if she does. A friend with mental problems. A friend who sometimes very runs to struggle with her eating disorder. And when Lilo panic attacks. Can Carrie that do accept. It&rsquo;s on a Sunday afternoon in Utrecht when Carrie tells lilo that Lilo is the true for her. That Carrie with Lilo wants to be old. As Carrie and Lilo are young. They belong together.
