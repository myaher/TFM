He found out she&rsquo;s family too and he wants to act accordly. Another missing moment before the battle.)</p><p>*</p><p>Outside the crypts, in stark contrast to the silence that he has just left behind, the night is a swarm of men in turmoil, a constellation of braziers and campfires that flare up like fallen stars, shouts and orders given over the noise of wind.</p><p>As soon as she can, Daenerys slips away, distancing herself from him as much as possible, shortly becoming a shadow among other shadows.</p><p>For a moment he is tempted to follow her, then the horns ring again. In his suddenly white and emptied mind, he has no doubt what to do, where to go. He runs towards the battlements and his hopes are not disappointed.</p><p>They are both there and at the sound of footsteps, they turn simultaneously to look at him. They appear surprised, like they hadn&rsquo;t expected to see him.</p><p>Sansa is the first to notice that something is wrong. She frowns, her eyes dancing on his face with something akin to a vigilant and cautious concern. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Daenerys?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya doesn&rsquo;t make a sound, but in his head he can hear a sharp voice similar to hers distinctly shouting that - <i>we need her dragons!</i></p><p>He could lie, reassure them. He tilts his head a little and forces himself not to take his eyes off, bearing the silent reproach in theirs as he says, &ldquo;She will not come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean-&rdquo; Sansa pales. &ldquo;No. Tell me you didn&rsquo;t. Of all the idiotic things you could have done!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Arya inquires.</p><p>&ldquo;He told her.&rdquo; Sansa&rsquo;s voice is flat and weary at the same time.</p><p>He looks at them and it&rsquo;s like something finally clicked in his head. Jon confusedly thinks that he should be more surprised, feel something different from this strange and absolute clear-headedness. For a moment, however, everything becomes obvious, transparent. There&rsquo;s a\u00a0clarity\u00a0to his thinking that&rsquo;s&hellip; frightening.</p><p>The truth looks at him from two pairs of eyes, unlike as sun and moon. And he loves them both, but in a different way and <i>oh, so that&rsquo;s the way things are.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Why now?
