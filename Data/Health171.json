If your week has been anything like mine, you made it to the weekend! With only two weeks left in the semester, there are a lot of final projects due and exams to study for. This past week as I drove to my normal Friday morning 7 am spin class, I kept thinking of all the things I needed to accomplish today before I babysit. I need to do my laundry, make a grocery list, study for my lab practical, work on my final projects, etc. My to do list at 6 am was already consuming me. I know this isn\u2019t ok and that I shouldn\u2019t let these things consume me, and that I always get everything I need done on time, but this morning was different. It wasn\u2019t until I clipped into my bike that I realized that I needed to check that to do list at the door and show up for myself. This morning hands down was one of my best spin classes I have ever taken, and it was because I used that time to clear my head and for that 45 minutes make myself my top priority. Today I want you to take two things from this post, take the time to be present with yourself and show up and to step back and take a deep breath.</p><p>I have been taking spin classes for almost two months now. They have become a part of my weekly routine and I love it. I have never enjoyed a workout class like I do spin, and that is why it is easy to show up at 6:45 for a 7 am class. Even though I take a class two to three times a week and know, and my wonderful instructors tell me every class to check my problems or to do\u2019s at the door, I don\u2019t always. Sometimes I jip myself of a great workout and time to clear my head, because I neglect myself. I let the assignments and the needs of others take precedent over my wants and needs, even when I know I shouldn\u2019t be letting that happen. So this morning I changed that. I turned my resistance up more than I usually do, I didn\u2019t start to slow down a little when I felt that burn, and when Zen jog rolled around and it was time to do what you needed to do for yourself, I did it! I jogged out of the saddle with resistance with a clear mind, showing up for myself and taking the time to be present. And after that ride, I felt calm and that to do list wasn\u2019t as scary as it was an hour before hand. Take the time to do the things you love and leave the stress and the worries of everyday life aside. You deserve to have time to yourself where you can reset and focus on what is really important, which is the health and well-being of you!</p><p>Step back and take a deep breath. This sounds easy, but it really isn\u2019t. How many times have you found yourself consumed in daily work or assignments and have forgotten to walk away for a second and just breathe? I know I do, and I have to be diligent in reminding myself to do so. With three weeks left I am up to my eyeballs with exams to study for, projects and papers that need to be done. So, every thirty minutes I set a timer to look away from the computer screen or textbook, and I take five minutes to take a deep breath and collect myself. To try and not let these things take my sanity and joy, because let\u2019s face it sometimes they do just that. Today, this weekend, net week, when things are hectic, make sure you are taking time to step back re-evaluate and breathe.</p><p>You are worthy of taking time for yourself and you deserve it. In order to get things done or take care of others, you have to always remember to take care of yourself in order to do so. Show up for yourself, make yourself feel important, and have a great week!</p>",
