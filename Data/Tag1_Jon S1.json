        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve just realised something about Tyrion &ndash; and mind you, it doesn\u2019t look good at all.</p><p>I was revolted (and I still am) by Tyrion\u2019s attitude in the last episodes, especially the fact that he denounced Varys, which led to his inevitable demise, even though Tyrion <i>knew </i>that Varys was right, that Daenerys was dangerous and that she would burn King\u2019s Landing to the ground.</p><p>I was also angry at him for basically doing nothing in the last episode. He acted like a drama queen by throwing his badge away and then encouraged Jon to kill Dany, <i>while he could have kept the badge and done something. </i>Tried to kill Dany himself. Hatched a plan. Actively conspired with Jon. Or even try to kill Dany and, if he failed, make Jon look like Dany\u2019s most loyal supporter so that Dany would not suspect a thing &ndash; which is a dumb plan but at least Tyrion would have done something.\u00a0</p><p>But then I thought about something.</p><!-- more --><h2><b>Tyrion purposefully sent Jon to his own death</b></h2><p>At this point, Jon was the only candidate for the Throne. Varys and Tyrion had talked about it a lot, and I think we can assume that Jon was the only option left. It was maybe not the <i>best </i>option, because Jon being King might have sparked a war, but it was still better than several Lords fighting each other in order to become King. Having a candidate with a good claim and a good reputation was the best option <i>available,\u00a0</i>\u00a0and, I daresay, the <i>only </i>option.\u00a0</p><p>Logically, Tyrion should have hatched a plan or something, prepared some ground for Daenerys\u2019 fall and for Jon\u2019s reign. But no &ndash; he just quit and then told Jon that he had to kill Dany. (Which, for the record, I don\u2019t disagree with. I think Dany needed to die. What I dislike is the fact that Tyrion did nothing but sit on his ass and expect other people to do the job.)</p><p>Except that Tyrion knows full well what the punishment for kingslaying is, no matter how cruel the assassinated monarch was. When sending Jon to kill Daenerys, he <i>had </i>to know that Jon would not live long after that. Granted, most Kingdoms would probably not care at all, but the Unsullied and the Dothraki <i>would </i>care, and a Kingslayer was unlikely to become King anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, Tyrion was in jail and did not have a way to know what had happened in detail - and yet, he spends time planning on a replacement for Jon. He does not even try to argue that yes, Jon killed Dany but it was justified and the only thing to do, and he happily fails to mention his own role in the murder - to instead walk away unpunished. After Jon killed Daenerys, Tyrion just&hellip; moved on and schemed with another King in mind. So no, you cannot tell me that Tyrion did not know that Jon\u2019s actions would likely have him killed. He knew.\u00a0<br/></p><p>And the worst thing is that Tyrion knew and never tried to think of another option. Not a single second. He was very confident of what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>Granted, Tyrion could not know he would survive. But he knew, for sure, that Jon would not, and even if he did he would no longer be a candidate for the Throne.</p><p><i>So Tyrion just sent the only candidate they had for the Throne to his own death and he was aware of it.</i></p><p>And, yeah, OK, bad writing and everything, but the Tyrion scene was not important in itself. Tyrion already had loads of scenes and of talking in this episode. Jon could have talked with Arya - who would have given him the same advice, and who would have helped him - or with Davos - who just did nothing in Season 8 except wanting to kill a woman who only appeared in Episode 2. So I am not sure we can say that it is only a case of bad writing, and that is what makes me so uncomfortable with Tyrion.</p><p>So what was he thinking? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll never know. But I\u2019m looking at the results.</p><h2><b>Tyrion built his own tyrannical government\u00a0</b></h2><p>We know that Tyrion managed to manipulate the people who were at the Dragonpit meeting so that they did what he wanted. I say\u00a0\u201cmanipulation\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. Whether it was a good thing or not is up for debate, but he did that. He charmed his way into getting people to do what he wanted. He sweet-talked them into listening to him. Tyrion Silver-Tongue has a talent for that.\u00a0</p><p>And because of that, we have a monarchy once again, with a monarch that Tyrion chose personnally, and Tyrion ends up being the Hand of the King (even though he proved that he was a shitty Hand) - which is supposed to be his punishment even though it is the thing he always dreamt of being.\u00a0</p><p>And then - look at the Council. He names his best mate Master of Coin even though Bronn knows nothing about money and even though the Crown, in all likelihood, has a giant debt to repay to the Iron Bank. Mind you, giving Bronn Highgarden in order not to be killed does <i>not </i>mean making him Lord Paramount of the Reach (you can transfer this title to whatever Lord in the Reach that is competent enough) and does not mean making him Treasurer in Chief of the realm either. And I am sure that there were other Lords that were more competent as well.</p><p>The others are not so bad, but there\u2019s still a problem with them anyway. Sam is sweet and full of good ideas, but he is not a Maester. At this point, he probably had no idea how to tend to people, even though most of the inhabitants of King\u2019s Landing need medical help. Sam doesn\u2019t know anything else either - administration, for example. Having him as one of Bran\u2019s advisors is not a bad idea in itself, but the Grand Maester should have been someone else.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Now, as much as I love Brienne and Davos, the fact that they are in the Small Council is troubling in itself. They are competent, it\u2019s a fact, but we can also see that Tyrion chose only his friends to be in the Small Council. This is why the last seats are empty: because he only chose friends of his. Which reveals, too, that the kingdoms are not at all represented in the Council. Sam, Davos, Brienne can hardly act as representatives of their respective kingdoms - for one, they haven\u2019t been there for a long time, and it is unlikely that anyone in the Reach or in the Stormlands would appeal to them if need be. I do not know much about politics, but it would have made sense to have a Dornish representative in the Council, as well as someone from the Iron Islands, maybe as a Master of Ships (after all, both kingdoms want independence, so tight relationships with them might ensure peace). Someone from the Riverlands would make sense as well, given that Lannisters and Tullys were at war, and maybe someone from the Vale (I mean, as the Vale are allied with the North, it would make sense to try and have good relationships with them)?</p><p>But no, Tyrion chose his friends. Of course, we might argue that it was Bran who chose them, but I doubt so. Bran only has a relationship with Sam. Bronn, Brienne and Davos are strangers to him. So, I think they really were Tyrion\u2019s choice - and Tyrion chose everything, even who should be King. If Bran chose them, he would have used his powers to know who was the most competent person in the realm. So the one in power is not Bran; it\u2019s actually Tyrion.</p><p>Then, of course, Tyrion\u2019s reasoning is that Bran would be a good King because he\u2019s neutral and would only do what is necessary for the realm - except that, of course, a neutral king who feels nothing is not a good idea. An emotionless king also means a king who does not feel pity or compassion. An emotionless king means a king who would plan everything according to a higher purpose, which would likely lead to neglecting everything that has nothing to do with the Great Purpose that only him could see - for example, the smallfolk. What is a few starved people compared to ensuring peace?\u00a0</p><p>So why would Tyrion choose Bran at all? My opinion is that, since Bran knows everything, Tyrion thinks he is the best safety system that could ever be. If the Small Council were to make a bad decision, Bran would know it and would stop it. If a rebellion or a war was arising, Bran would know it in time so that they be able to prepare and crush it. And he would not do it out of personal feelings, but because it is the truth, so people just have to nod.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion did not choose a king who would reign; he choose an insurance policy.\u00a0</p><p>Basically, the Council just has to make choices and Bran says\u00a0\u201cyes\u201d or\u00a0\u201cno\u201d. This is basically what happens in the last episode: Bran leaves, the Council makes decisions. Because this is the thing with a King who feels nothing at all: most things are inconsequential and are not important in the great scheme of things.\u00a0</p><p>So Tyrion would make decisions, and expect Bran to tell him if his choices are bad. That\u2019s all.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s a convenient system. People only have to do what the King tells them to do. Bran knows better after all, he is a godlike entity, isn\u2019t he? We fall into a pattern of blind obedience. And Bran knows everything, which is just creepy and reminds me of the Patriot\u2019s Act if you want my opinion. And finally &ndash; look at what Tyrion is doing in the final episode, chanting\u00a0\u201cAll hail Bran the Broken\u201d and everything.\u00a0</p><p>Blind obedience. Capacity to spy on everyone. Institutionalised devotion. Government composed of close friends, not competent people.\u00a0</p><p>Yeah, it makes me feel really uneasy.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Actually, Tyrion acts just like Daenerys</b></h2><p>It makes me even more uneasy when we know that Tyrion fell into that trap before with Daenerys (except that\u00a0\u201ccapacity to spy on everyone\u201d was replaced with\u00a0\u201ccapacity to kill everyone\u201d).\u00a0</p><p>This is why I am wary of Tyrion. He got rid of Jon, and I have difficulty believing that it was not intentional. And now, he\u2019s setting up a government that looks pretty much tyrannical.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The thing is, Tyrion acts very much like Dany, and that\u2019s why I believe he loved her, as he told Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion also confesses that he hasn\u2019t had sex in a while, ever since Shae. And this is the thing. He has not been interested by women ever since Shae - or even since Daenerys. The two event pretty much occur at the same time, actually.\u00a0And remember Tyrion\u2019s face during Jon and Dany\u2019s boatbang? Yeah. It was jealousy.</p><p>The thing was Tyrion admired Dany a lot. He agreed with almost everything she did, except for burning people. I think that\u2019s where Tyrion draws the line: massacring civilians for the sake of it.</p><p>Tyrion denounced Varys for trying to kill Daenerys and for generally opposing her, while knowing full well that she would burn King\u2019s Landing to the ground. Tyrion tries to prevent that from happening by sending Jaime to Cersei, but actually, if he really wanted to prevent it, the real solution was to kill Dany or support Jon\u2019s claim, or at least let Varys do his business. Tyrion could just turn a blind eye and let things happen. No one would have resented him.</p><p>The thing is that Tyrion <i>still </i>wanted to be by Dany\u2019s side. His aim was to prevent her from burning King\u2019s Landing, but he knew, <i>he had to know</i>, that she would burn other cities. That it would not be the end of it. But even though he betrayed her, he did not ensure that she would never hurt anyone. For me, it shows that he was still willing to follow her. Granted, he would have tried, again and again, to prevent her from burning citizens, but he was still willing to be by her side. He knew that a massacre was coming and he still loved Daenerys. She had committed massacres already and he still supported her.\u00a0</p><p>In the last episode, he mentions that\u00a0\u201cshe killed the bad guys and we cheered her for it\u201d, but he never mentions how the bad guys might&hellip; not actually be bad guys, after all (if we think about the innocent masters or the Khals, who weren\u2019t killed because of their way of life but because she wanted to take their place). He never mentions that her way of killing people was cruel even from the start. He agreed with it up until she began burning people he knew and loved.\u00a0</p><p>In the same way, he did not think she should just calm down and stop threatening people, he thought people should stop <i>provoking </i>her. He already knew what was likely to happen if people (let\u2019s say, Sansa) kept doing so. He was uneasy with it. But he still supported Daenerys. \n\n<br/></p><p>And why, would you say? Why would he draw the limit at\u00a0\u201cburning civilians\u201d but not for the rest? Because Tyrion thought she was doing great with the rest. And we see that in his government, because it mimicks Daenerys\u2019.</p><p>His government is composed of close friends that would not oppose him, or so he thinks; and it relies heavily on obedience.\n\nThe economy is not important in the government; no one takes military decisions but the authority in place (Dany or Bran or Tyrion); a lot of attention is given to the personal guard, but not to the rest. No one is there to represent the law. Most locals or nobles are not represented. People who have done nothing to deserve their titles get high authority. And, even though he has seen first hand what happens when someone is given way too much authority, he still believes in a strong central government with no room for independence, just like Dany - because he has the Bran safety stamp, so no problem.</p><p>\u00a0Tyrion tries to impose a kind of personality cult around Bran that looks like the one around Dany - Bran is magical so he knows better; Bran\u2019s decisions are to be met with blind agreement because, you know, he\u2019s omniscient. Tyrion\u2019s government relies heavily on magical powers that actually put civilians at great risk. Tyrion\u2019s choice as king would most likely focus on the Great Scheme of Things and The Higher Purpose, just like Dany did - even if there is a high risk that things go downhill for the common people, just like with Dany.\u00a0</p><p>And Tyrion suffers from the same ambition than Dany. Tyrion loves power, we know that. And he seeks glory as well, thinking himself to be super important in the story when he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s just as self-righteous as Dany was. If you look at his time as Joffrey\u2019s Hand, his decisions were to be respected and he was to have power because he was the one to deserve it, and because he knows better. (You know, he drinks and he knows things.) His choice of Bran as King is to be respected because he knows things and because he\u2019s wise and whatever. He gets rid of Jon because\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s the only thing to do, there\u2019s no other choice\u201d &ndash; and then he plots for another king that fits his personal criteria, which coincidentally happen to be a replica of <i>Daenerys</i>\u2019 criteria. You know what it reminds me of?\u00a0\u201cYou are not fit to rule. But I am.\u201d <i>You are not fit to make decisions and to choose a King, but I am.</i></p><p>This is why Tyrion was so blind to Dany\u2019s cruelty, and why it became different for him when she burnt people he knew: because in the end, he would have done things like her. Tyrion has learnt nothing, even though he pretends he had. He keeps committing the same mistakes over and over again.</p><p>Of course, you would say,\u00a0\u201cBut Bran knows everything and if he thought that Tyrion was a bad person he would not have taken the Throne or taken Tyrion as Hand\u201d and, actually, I think that Bran had no way of knowing that. Bran sees things, he does not feel them. He does not read people\u2019s minds. He does not know that Tyrion shares similarities with Dany.</p><p>Because yes, he does.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is that, just like Dany, I don\u2019t think he is conscious of it. I don\u2019t think he coldly thought\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s have Jon killed along with Dany, two birds with one stone, I need to get rid of Jon\u201d. He did send him to his likely death, and was certain that he would prevent Jon from being King, but I don\u2019t think it was the result of a coldblooded scheme to get rid of Jon. I think that Tyrion is like Dany in this respect. He thought it was necessary. He justified it by telling it was the only thing left to do. And after all, he ensured that Jon did not die, and Jon didn\u2019t want that Throne anyway, did he? So, no harm done.\u00a0</p><p>I am sure this is Tyrion\u2019s reasoning. He chooses Bran because he thinks it\u2019s the best choice. He handles his government in a certain way because he\u2019s certain that this is the best thing to do. Because just like Daenerys, he\u2019s proud and he thinks he\u2019s always right. And just like Daenerys, he has a way to seduce people into, if not following him, at least listening to him.\u00a0</p><p><i>And if people agree with him then he\u2019s doing things right, isn\u2019t he?</i></p><h2><b>Conclusion - Tyrion has the potential to be your everyday villain, just like Dany</b></h2><p>I don\u2019t think Tyrion was smiling in a satisfied, evil way and rubbing his hands together because everything went according to plan. He is exactly the type of villain that Dany was. The type that people (both in the show and in the audience) can like, the type that is relatable. The type that does not do bad things because he\u2019s evil but because he thinks it\u2019s the only way and because it\u2019s the right thing to do. The type that does not realise that he\u2019s doing bad things; and when he does, he thinks he has to do so nevertheless for\u00a0\u201cthe greater good\u201d. <i>He is just like Dany.\u00a0</i></p><p>Of course, Tyrion will not end up burning cities to the ground. No, I see him making decisions that might have disastrous consequences - starvation, revolts, wars, things like that. If we\u2019re lucky, maybe Bran will be able to prevent it from happening. I think maybe Tyrion will not even commit such mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>But he has the <i>potential </i>to commit them, because he makes horrible decisions that he feels are justified (like sending Jon to his own death), because he always turns things to his own advantage, because he likes power, because he reproduces a tyrannical system, <i>because he does not realise it</i>, because he has fallen in the same trap than Dany - that is, thinking that he is the hero.\u00a0</p><p>And the worst thing is that, if you want my opinion, D&amp;D did not realise what they might have done with Tyrion\u2019s character. They were blind to Dany\u2019s cruelties in the past. She was their heroine up until GRRM said\u00a0\u201chell no, she\u2019s the bad one\u201d.

Varys and Tyrion had talked about it a lot, and I think we can assume that Jon was the only option left. It was maybe not the <i>best </i>option, because Jon being King might have sparked a war, but it was still better than several Lords fighting each other in order to become King. Having a candidate with a good claim and a good reputation was the best option <i>available,\u00a0</i>\u00a0and, I daresay, the <i>only </i>option.\u00a0</p><p>Logically, Tyrion should have hatched a plan or something, prepared some ground for Daenerys\u2019 fall and for Jon\u2019s reign. But no \u2013 he just quit and then told Jon that he had to kill Dany. (Which, for the record, I don\u2019t disagree with. I think Dany needed to die. What I dislike is the fact that Tyrion did nothing but sit on his ass and expect other people to do the job.)</p><p>Except that Tyrion knows full well what the punishment for kingslaying is, no matter how cruel the assassinated monarch was. When sending Jon to kill Daenerys, he <i>had </i>to know that Jon would not live long after that. Granted, most Kingdoms would probably not care at all, but the Unsullied and the Dothraki <i>would </i>care, and a Kingslayer was unlikely to become King anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, Tyrion was in jail and did not have a way to know what had happened in detail - and yet, he spends time planning on a replacement for Jon. He does not even try to argue that yes, Jon killed Dany but it was justified and the only thing to do, and he happily fails to mention his own role in the murder - to instead walk away unpunished. After Jon killed Daenerys, Tyrion just\u2026 moved on and schemed with another King in mind. So no, you cannot tell me that Tyrion did not know that Jon\u2019s actions would likely have him killed. He knew.\u00a0<br></p><p>And the worst thing is that Tyrion knew and never tried to think of another option. Not a single second. He was very confident of what he was doing.\u00a0</p><p>Granted, Tyrion could not know he would survive. But he knew, for sure, that Jon would not, and even if he did he would no longer be a candidate for the Throne.</p><p><i>So Tyrion just sent the only candidate they had for the Throne to his own death and he was aware of it.</i></p><p>And, yeah, OK, bad writing and everything, but the Tyrion scene was not important in itself. Tyrion already had loads of scenes and of talking in this episode. Jon could have talked with Arya - who would have given him the same advice, and who would have helped him - or with Davos - who just did nothing in Season 8 except wanting to kill a woman who only appeared in Episode 2. So I am not sure we can say that it is only a case of bad writing, and that is what makes me so uncomfortable with Tyrion.</p><p>So what was he thinking? I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll never know. But I\u2019m looking at the results.</p><h2><b>Tyrion built his own tyrannical government\u00a0</b></h2><p>We know that Tyrion managed to manipulate the people who were at the Dragonpit meeting so that they did what he wanted. I say\u00a0\u201cmanipulation\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. Whether it was a good thing or not is up for debate, but he did that. He charmed his way into getting people to do what he wanted. He sweet-talked them into listening to him. Tyrion Silver-Tongue has a talent for that.\u00a0</p><p>And because of that, we have a monarchy once again, with a monarch that Tyrion chose personnally, and Tyrion ends up being the Hand of the King (even though he proved that he was a shitty Hand) - which is supposed to be his punishment even though it is the thing he always dreamt of being.\u00a0</p><p>And then - look at the Council. He names his best mate Master of Coin even though Bronn knows nothing about money and even though the Crown, in all likelihood, has a giant debt to repay to the Iron Bank. Mind you, giving Bronn Highgarden in order not to be killed does <i>not </i>mean making him Lord Paramount of the Reach (you can transfer this title to whatever Lord in the Reach that is competent enough) and does not mean making him Treasurer in Chief of the realm either. And I am sure that there were other Lords that were more competent as well.</p><p>The others are not so bad, but there\u2019s still a problem with them anyway. Sam is sweet and full of good ideas, but he is not a Maester. At this point, he probably had no idea how to tend to people, even though most of the inhabitants of King\u2019s Landing need medical help. Sam doesn\u2019t know anything else either - administration, for example. Having him as one of Bran\u2019s advisors is not a bad idea in itself, but the Grand Maester should have been someone else.\u00a0<br></p><p>Now, as much as I love Brienne and Davos, the fact that they are in the Small Council is troubling in itself. They are competent, it\u2019s a fact, but we can also see that Tyrion chose only his friends to be in the Small Council. This is why the last seats are empty: because he only chose friends of his. Which reveals, too, that the kingdoms are not at all represented in the Council. Sam, Davos, Brienne can hardly act as representatives of their respective kingdoms - for one, they haven\u2019t been there for a long time, and it is unlikely that anyone in the Reach or in the Stormlands would appeal to them if need be. I do not know much about politics, but it would have made sense to have a Dornish representative in the Council, as well as someone from the Iron Islands, maybe as a Master of Ships (after all, both kingdoms want independence, so tight relationships with them might ensure peace). Someone from the Riverlands would make sense as well, given that Lannisters and Tullys were at war, and maybe someone from the Vale (I mean, as the Vale are allied with the North, it would make sense to try and have good relationships with them)?</p><p>But no, Tyrion chose his friends. Of course, we might argue that it was Bran who chose them, but I doubt so. Bran only has a relationship with Sam. Bronn, Brienne and Davos are strangers to him. So, I think they really were Tyrion\u2019s choice - and Tyrion chose everything, even who should be King. If Bran chose them, he would have used his powers to know who was the most competent person in the realm. So the one in power is not Bran; it\u2019s actually Tyrion.</p><p>Then, of course, Tyrion\u2019s reasoning is that Bran would be a good King because he\u2019s neutral and would only do what is necessary for the realm - except that, of course, a neutral king who feels nothing is not a good idea. An emotionless king also means a king who does not feel pity or compassion. An emotionless king means a king who would plan everything according to a higher purpose, which would likely lead to neglecting everything that has nothing to do with the Great Purpose that only him could see - for example, the smallfolk. What is a few starved people compared to ensuring peace?\u00a0</p><p>So why would Tyrion choose Bran at all? My opinion is that, since Bran knows everything, Tyrion thinks he is the best safety system that could ever be. If the Small Council were to make a bad decision, Bran would know it and would stop it. If a rebellion or a war was arising, Bran would know it in time so that they be able to prepare and crush it. And he would not do it out of personal feelings, but because it is the truth, so people just have to nod.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion did not choose a king who would reign; he choose an insurance policy.\u00a0</p><p>Basically, the Council just has to make choices and Bran says\u00a0\u201cyes\u201d or\u00a0\u201cno\u201d. This is basically what happens in the last episode: Bran leaves, the Council makes decisions. Because this is the thing with a King who feels nothing at all: most things are inconsequential and are not important in the great scheme of things.\u00a0</p><p>So Tyrion would make decisions, and expect Bran to tell him if his choices are bad. That\u2019s all.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s a convenient system. People only have to do what the King tells them to do. Bran knows better after all, he is a godlike entity, isn\u2019t he? We fall into a pattern of blind obedience. And Bran knows everything, which is just creepy and reminds me of the Patriot\u2019s Act if you want my opinion. And finally \u2013 look at what Tyrion is doing in the final episode, chanting\u00a0\u201cAll hail Bran the Broken\u201d and everything.\u00a0</p><p>Blind obedience. Capacity to spy on everyone. Institutionalised devotion. Government composed of close friends, not competent people.\u00a0</p><p>Yeah, it makes me feel really uneasy.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Actually, Tyrion acts just like Daenerys</b></h2><p>It makes me even more uneasy when we know that Tyrion fell into that trap before with Daenerys (except that\u00a0\u201ccapacity to spy on everyone\u201d was replaced with\u00a0\u201ccapacity to kill everyone\u201d).\u00a0</p><p>This is why I am wary of Tyrion. He got rid of Jon, and I have difficulty believing that it was not intentional. And now, he\u2019s setting up a government that looks pretty much tyrannical.\u00a0<br></p><p>The thing is, Tyrion acts very much like Dany, and that\u2019s why I believe he loved her, as he told Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion also confesses that he hasn\u2019t had sex in a while, ever since Shae. And this is the thing. He has not been interested by women ever since Shae - or even since Daenerys. The two event pretty much occur at the same time, actually.\u00a0And remember Tyrion\u2019s face during Jon and Dany\u2019s boatbang? Yeah. It was jealousy.</p><p>The thing was Tyrion admired Dany a lot. He agreed with almost everything she did, except for burning people. I think that\u2019s where Tyrion draws the line: massacring civilians for the sake of it.</p><p>Tyrion denounced Varys for trying to kill Daenerys and for generally opposing her, while knowing full well that she would burn King\u2019s Landing to the ground. Tyrion tries to prevent that from happening by sending Jaime to Cersei, but actually, if he really wanted to prevent it, the real solution was to kill Dany or support Jon\u2019s claim, or at least let Varys do his business. Tyrion could just turn a blind eye and let things happen. No one would have resented him.</p><p>The thing is that Tyrion <i>still </i>wanted to be by Dany\u2019s side. His aim was to prevent her from burning King\u2019s Landing, but he knew, <i>he had to know</i>, that she would burn other cities. That it would not be the end of it. But even though he betrayed her, he did not ensure that she would never hurt anyone. For me, it shows that he was still willing to follow her. Granted, he would have tried, again and again, to prevent her from burning citizens, but he was still willing to be by her side. He knew that a massacre was coming and he still loved Daenerys. She had committed massacres already and he still supported her.\u00a0</p><p>In the last episode, he mentions that\u00a0\u201cshe killed the bad guys and we cheered her for it\u201d, but he never mentions how the bad guys might\u2026 not actually be bad guys, after all (if we think about the innocent masters or the Khals, who weren\u2019t killed because of their way of life but because she wanted to take their place). He never mentions that her way of killing people was cruel even from the start. He agreed with it up until she began burning people he knew and loved.\u00a0</p><p>In the same way, he did not think she should just calm down and stop threatening people, he thought people should stop <i>provoking </i>her. He already knew what was likely to happen if people (let\u2019s say, Sansa) kept doing so. He was uneasy with it. But he still supported Daenerys. \n\n<br></p><p>And why, would you say? Why would he draw the limit at\u00a0\u201cburning civilians\u201d but not for the rest? Because Tyrion thought she was doing great with the rest. And we see that in his government, because it mimicks Daenerys\u2019.</p><p>His government is composed of close friends that would not oppose him, or so he thinks; and it relies heavily on obedience.\n\nThe economy is not important in the government; no one takes military decisions but the authority in place (Dany or Bran or Tyrion); a lot of attention is given to the personal guard, but not to the rest. No one is there to represent the law. Most locals or nobles are not represented. People who have done nothing to deserve their titles get high authority. And, even though he has seen first hand what happens when someone is given way too much authority, he still believes in a strong central government with no room for independence, just like Dany - because he has the Bran safety stamp, so no problem.</p><p>\u00a0Tyrion tries to impose a kind of personality cult around Bran that looks like the one around Dany - Bran is magical so he knows better; Bran\u2019s decisions are to be met with blind agreement because, you know, he\u2019s omniscient. Tyrion\u2019s government relies heavily on magical powers that actually put civilians at great risk. Tyrion\u2019s choice as king would most likely focus on the Great Scheme of Things and The Higher Purpose, just like Dany did - even if there is a high risk that things go downhill for the common people, just like with Dany.\u00a0</p><p>And Tyrion suffers from the same ambition than Dany. Tyrion loves power, we know that. And he seeks glory as well, thinking himself to be super important in the story when he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s just as self-righteous as Dany was. If you look at his time as Joffrey\u2019s Hand, his decisions were to be respected and he was to have power because he was the one to deserve it, and because he knows better. (You know, he drinks and he knows things.) His choice of Bran as King is to be respected because he knows things and because he\u2019s wise and whatever. He gets rid of Jon because\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s the only thing to do, there\u2019s no other choice\u201d \u2013 and then he plots for another king that fits his personal criteria, which coincidentally happen to be a replica of <i>Daenerys</i>\u2019 criteria. You know what it reminds me of?\u00a0\u201cYou are not fit to rule. But I am.\u201d <i>You are not fit to make decisions and to choose a King, but I am.</i></p><p>This is why Tyrion was so blind to Dany\u2019s cruelty, and why it became different for him when she burnt people he knew: because in the end, he would have done things like her. Tyrion has learnt nothing, even though he pretends he had. He keeps committing the same mistakes over and over again.</p><p>Of course, you would say,\u00a0\u201cBut Bran knows everything and if he thought that Tyrion was a bad person he would not have taken the Throne or taken Tyrion as Hand\u201d and, actually, I think that Bran had no way of knowing that. Bran sees things, he does not feel them. He does not read people\u2019s minds. He does not know that Tyrion shares similarities with Dany.</p><p>Because yes, he does.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is that, just like Dany, I don\u2019t think he is conscious of it. I don\u2019t think he coldly thought\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s have Jon killed along with Dany, two birds with one stone, I need to get rid of Jon\u201d. He did send him to his likely death, and was certain that he would prevent Jon from being King, but I don\u2019t think it was the result of a coldblooded scheme to get rid of Jon. I think that Tyrion is like Dany in this respect. He thought it was necessary. He justified it by telling it was the only thing left to do. And after all, he ensured that Jon did not die, and Jon didn\u2019t want that Throne anyway, did he? So, no harm done.\u00a0</p><p>I am sure this is Tyrion\u2019s reasoning. He chooses Bran because he thinks it\u2019s the best choice. He handles his government in a certain way because he\u2019s certain that this is the best thing to do. Because just like Daenerys, he\u2019s proud and he thinks he\u2019s always right. And just like Daenerys, he has a way to seduce people into, if not following him, at least listening to him.\u00a0</p><p><i>And if people agree with him then he\u2019s doing things right, isn\u2019t he?</i></p><h2><b>Conclusion - Tyrion has the potential to be your everyday villain, just like Dany</b></h2><p>I don\u2019t think Tyrion was smiling in a satisfied, evil way and rubbing his hands together because everything went according to plan. He is exactly the type of villain that Dany was. The type that people (both in the show and in the audience) can like, the type that is relatable. The type that does not do bad things because he\u2019s evil but because he thinks it\u2019s the only way and because it\u2019s the right thing to do. The type that does not realise that he\u2019s doing bad things; and when he does, he thinks he has to do so nevertheless for\u00a0\u201cthe greater good\u201d. <i>He is just like Dany.\u00a0</i></p><p>Of course, Tyrion will not end up burning cities to the ground. No, I see him making decisions that might have disastrous consequences - starvation, revolts, wars, things like that. If we\u2019re lucky, maybe Bran will be able to prevent it from happening. I think maybe Tyrion will not even commit such mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>But he has the <i>potential </i>to commit them, because he makes horrible decisions that he feels are justified (like sending Jon to his own death), because he always turns things to his own advantage, because he likes power, because he reproduces a tyrannical system, <i>because he does not realise it</i>, because he has fallen in the same trap than Dany - that is, thinking that he is the hero.\u00a0</p><p>And the worst thing is that, if you want my opinion, D&amp;D did not realise what they might have done with Tyrion\u2019s character. They were blind to Dany\u2019s cruelties in the past. She was their heroine up until GRRM said\u00a0\u201chell no, she\u2019s the bad one\u201d. D&amp;D reproduced the same system all over again without even seeing what they did.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, this is only my interpretation (and it might be heavily influenced by my own dislike of Tyrion after Season 8, or by the awful writing). I am open to any comment and/or constructive criticism. But I\u2019m pretty sure that Tyrion is much more dangerous than we thought.</p>",

But I\u2019m looking at the results.</p><h2><b>Tyrion built his own tyrannical government\u00a0</b></h2><p>We know that Tyrion managed to manipulate the people who were at the Dragonpit meeting so that they did what he wanted. I say\u00a0\u201cmanipulation\u201d, because that\u2019s exactly what it is. Whether it was a good thing or not is up for debate, but he did that. He charmed his way into getting people to do what he wanted. He sweet-talked them into listening to him. Tyrion Silver-Tongue has a talent for that.\u00a0</p><p>And because of that, we have a monarchy once again, with a monarch that Tyrion chose personnally, and Tyrion ends up being the Hand of the King (even though he proved that he was a shitty Hand) - which is supposed to be his punishment even though it is the thing he always dreamt of being.\u00a0</p><p>And then - look at the Council. He names his best mate Master of Coin even though Bronn knows nothing about money and even though the Crown, in all likelihood, has a giant debt to repay to the Iron Bank. Mind you, giving Bronn Highgarden in order not to be killed does <i>not </i>mean making him Lord Paramount of the Reach (you can transfer this title to whatever Lord in the Reach that is competent enough) and does not mean making him Treasurer in Chief of the realm either. And I am sure that there were other Lords that were more competent as well.</p><p>The others are not so bad, but there\u2019s still a problem with them anyway. Sam is sweet and full of good ideas, but he is not a Maester. At this point, he probably had no idea how to tend to people, even though most of the inhabitants of King\u2019s Landing need medical help. Sam doesn\u2019t know anything else either - administration, for example. Having him as one of Bran\u2019s advisors is not a bad idea in itself, but the Grand Maester should have been someone else.\u00a0<br></p><p>Now, as much as I love Brienne and Davos, the fact that they are in the Small Council is troubling in itself. They are competent, it\u2019s a fact, but we can also see that Tyrion chose only his friends to be in the Small Council. This is why the last seats are empty: because he only chose friends of his. Which reveals, too, that the kingdoms are not at all represented in the Council. Sam, Davos, Brienne can hardly act as representatives of their respective kingdoms - for one, they haven\u2019t been there for a long time, and it is unlikely that anyone in the Reach or in the Stormlands would appeal to them if need be. I do not know much about politics, but it would have made sense to have a Dornish representative in the Council, as well as someone from the Iron Islands, maybe as a Master of Ships (after all, both kingdoms want independence, so tight relationships with them might ensure peace). Someone from the Riverlands would make sense as well, given that Lannisters and Tullys were at war, and maybe someone from the Vale (I mean, as the Vale are allied with the North, it would make sense to try and have good relationships with them)?</p><p>But no, Tyrion chose his friends. Of course, we might argue that it was Bran who chose them, but I doubt so. Bran only has a relationship with Sam. Bronn, Brienne and Davos are strangers to him. So, I think they really were Tyrion\u2019s choice - and Tyrion chose everything, even who should be King. If Bran chose them, he would have used his powers to know who was the most competent person in the realm. So the one in power is not Bran; it\u2019s actually Tyrion.</p><p>Then, of course, Tyrion\u2019s reasoning is that Bran would be a good King because he\u2019s neutral and would only do what is necessary for the realm - except that, of course, a neutral king who feels nothing is not a good idea. An emotionless king also means a king who does not feel pity or compassion. An emotionless king means a king who would plan everything according to a higher purpose, which would likely lead to neglecting everything that has nothing to do with the Great Purpose that only him could see - for example, the smallfolk. What is a few starved people compared to ensuring peace?\u00a0</p><p>So why would Tyrion choose Bran at all? My opinion is that, since Bran knows everything, Tyrion thinks he is the best safety system that could ever be. If the Small Council were to make a bad decision, Bran would know it and would stop it. If a rebellion or a war was arising, Bran would know it in time so that they be able to prepare and crush it. And he would not do it out of personal feelings, but because it is the truth, so people just have to nod.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion did not choose a king who would reign; he choose an insurance policy.\u00a0</p><p>Basically, the Council just has to make choices and Bran says\u00a0\u201cyes\u201d or\u00a0\u201cno\u201d. This is basically what happens in the last episode: Bran leaves, the Council makes decisions. Because this is the thing with a King who feels nothing at all: most things are inconsequential and are not important in the great scheme of things.\u00a0</p><p>So Tyrion would make decisions, and expect Bran to tell him if his choices are bad. That\u2019s all.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s a convenient system. People only have to do what the King tells them to do. Bran knows better after all, he is a godlike entity, isn\u2019t he? We fall into a pattern of blind obedience. And Bran knows everything, which is just creepy and reminds me of the Patriot\u2019s Act if you want my opinion. And finally \u2013 look at what Tyrion is doing in the final episode, chanting\u00a0\u201cAll hail Bran the Broken\u201d and everything.\u00a0</p><p>Blind obedience. Capacity to spy on everyone. Institutionalised devotion. Government composed of close friends, not competent people.\u00a0</p><p>Yeah, it makes me feel really uneasy.\u00a0</p><h2><b>Actually, Tyrion acts just like Daenerys</b></h2><p>It makes me even more uneasy when we know that Tyrion fell into that trap before with Daenerys (except that\u00a0\u201ccapacity to spy on everyone\u201d was replaced with\u00a0\u201ccapacity to kill everyone\u201d).\u00a0</p><p>This is why I am wary of Tyrion. He got rid of Jon, and I have difficulty believing that it was not intentional. And now, he\u2019s setting up a government that looks pretty much tyrannical.\u00a0<br></p><p>The thing is, Tyrion acts very much like Dany, and that\u2019s why I believe he loved her, as he told Jon.\u00a0</p><p>Tyrion also confesses that he hasn\u2019t had sex in a while, ever since Shae. And this is the thing. He has not been interested by women ever since Shae - or even since Daenerys. The two event pretty much occur at the same time, actually.\u00a0And remember Tyrion\u2019s face during Jon and Dany\u2019s boatbang? Yeah. It was jealousy.</p><p>The thing was Tyrion admired Dany a lot. He agreed with almost everything she did, except for burning people. I think that\u2019s where Tyrion draws the line: massacring civilians for the sake of it.</p><p>Tyrion denounced Varys for trying to kill Daenerys and for generally opposing her, while knowing full well that she would burn King\u2019s Landing to the ground. Tyrion tries to prevent that from happening by sending Jaime to Cersei, but actually, if he really wanted to prevent it, the real solution was to kill Dany or support Jon\u2019s claim, or at least let Varys do his business. Tyrion could just turn a blind eye and let things happen. No one would have resented him.</p><p>The thing is that Tyrion <i>still </i>wanted to be by Dany\u2019s side. His aim was to prevent her from burning King\u2019s Landing, but he knew, <i>he had to know</i>, that she would burn other cities. That it would not be the end of it. But even though he betrayed her, he did not ensure that she would never hurt anyone. For me, it shows that he was still willing to follow her. Granted, he would have tried, again and again, to prevent her from burning citizens, but he was still willing to be by her side. He knew that a massacre was coming and he still loved Daenerys. She had committed massacres already and he still supported her.\u00a0</p><p>In the last episode, he mentions that\u00a0\u201cshe killed the bad guys and we cheered her for it\u201d, but he never mentions how the bad guys might\u2026 not actually be bad guys, after all (if we think about the innocent masters or the Khals, who weren\u2019t killed because of their way of life but because she wanted to take their place). He never mentions that her way of killing people was cruel even from the start. He agreed with it up until she began burning people he knew and loved.\u00a0</p><p>In the same way, he did not think she should just calm down and stop threatening people, he thought people should stop <i>provoking </i>her. He already knew what was likely to happen if people (let\u2019s say, Sansa) kept doing so. He was uneasy with it. But he still supported Daenerys. \n\n<br></p><p>And why, would you say? Why would he draw the limit at\u00a0\u201cburning civilians\u201d but not for the rest? Because Tyrion thought she was doing great with the rest. And we see that in his government, because it mimicks Daenerys\u2019.</p><p>His government is composed of close friends that would not oppose him, or so he thinks; and it relies heavily on obedience.\n\nThe economy is not important in the government; no one takes military decisions but the authority in place (Dany or Bran or Tyrion); a lot of attention is given to the personal guard, but not to the rest. No one is there to represent the law. Most locals or nobles are not represented. People who have done nothing to deserve their titles get high authority. And, even though he has seen first hand what happens when someone is given way too much authority, he still believes in a strong central government with no room for independence, just like Dany - because he has the Bran safety stamp, so no problem.</p><p>\u00a0Tyrion tries to impose a kind of personality cult around Bran that looks like the one around Dany - Bran is magical so he knows better; Bran\u2019s decisions are to be met with blind agreement because, you know, he\u2019s omniscient. Tyrion\u2019s government relies heavily on magical powers that actually put civilians at great risk. Tyrion\u2019s choice as king would most likely focus on the Great Scheme of Things and The Higher Purpose, just like Dany did - even if there is a high risk that things go downhill for the common people, just like with Dany.\u00a0</p><p>And Tyrion suffers from the same ambition than Dany. Tyrion loves power, we know that. And he seeks glory as well, thinking himself to be super important in the story when he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s just as self-righteous as Dany was. If you look at his time as Joffrey\u2019s Hand, his decisions were to be respected and he was to have power because he was the one to deserve it, and because he knows better. (You know, he drinks and he knows things.) His choice of Bran as King is to be respected because he knows things and because he\u2019s wise and whatever. He gets rid of Jon because\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s the only thing to do, there\u2019s no other choice\u201d \u2013 and then he plots for another king that fits his personal criteria, which coincidentally happen to be a replica of <i>Daenerys</i>\u2019 criteria. You know what it reminds me of?\u00a0\u201cYou are not fit to rule. But I am.\u201d <i>You are not fit to make decisions and to choose a King, but I am.</i></p><p>This is why Tyrion was so blind to Dany\u2019s cruelty, and why it became different for him when she burnt people he knew: because in the end, he would have done things like her. Tyrion has learnt nothing, even though he pretends he had. He keeps committing the same mistakes over and over again.</p><p>Of course, you would say,\u00a0\u201cBut Bran knows everything and if he thought that Tyrion was a bad person he would not have taken the Throne or taken Tyrion as Hand\u201d and, actually, I think that Bran had no way of knowing that. Bran sees things, he does not feel them. He does not read people\u2019s minds. He does not know that Tyrion shares similarities with Dany.</p><p>Because yes, he does.\u00a0</p><p>The thing is that, just like Dany, I don\u2019t think he is conscious of it. I don\u2019t think he coldly thought\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s have Jon killed along with Dany, two birds with one stone, I need to get rid of Jon\u201d. He did send him to his likely death, and was certain that he would prevent Jon from being King, but I don\u2019t think it was the result of a coldblooded scheme to get rid of Jon. I think that Tyrion is like Dany in this respect. He thought it was necessary. He justified it by telling it was the only thing left to do. And after all, he ensured that Jon did not die, and Jon didn\u2019t want that Throne anyway, did he? So, no harm done.\u00a0</p><p>I am sure this is Tyrion\u2019s reasoning. He chooses Bran because he thinks it\u2019s the best choice. He handles his government in a certain way because he\u2019s certain that this is the best thing to do. Because just like Daenerys, he\u2019s proud and he thinks he\u2019s always right. And just like Daenerys, he has a way to seduce people into, if not following him, at least listening to him.\u00a0</p><p><i>And if people agree with him then he\u2019s doing things right, isn\u2019t he?</i></p><h2><b>Conclusion - Tyrion has the potential to be your everyday villain, just like Dany</b></h2><p>I don\u2019t think Tyrion was smiling in a satisfied, evil way and rubbing his hands together because everything went according to plan. He is exactly the type of villain that Dany was. The type that people (both in the show and in the audience) can like, the type that is relatable. The type that does not do bad things because he\u2019s evil but because he thinks it\u2019s the only way and because it\u2019s the right thing to do. The type that does not realise that he\u2019s doing bad things; and when he does, he thinks he has to do so nevertheless for\u00a0\u201cthe greater good\u201d. <i>He is just like Dany.\u00a0</i></p><p>Of course, Tyrion will not end up burning cities to the ground. No, I see him making decisions that might have disastrous consequences - starvation, revolts, wars, things like that. If we\u2019re lucky, maybe Bran will be able to prevent it from happening. I think maybe Tyrion will not even commit such mistakes.\u00a0</p><p>But he has the <i>potential </i>to commit them, because he makes horrible decisions that he feels are justified (like sending Jon to his own death), because he always turns things to his own advantage, because he likes power, because he reproduces a tyrannical system, <i>because he does not realise it</i>, because he has fallen in the same trap than Dany - that is, thinking that he is the hero.\u00a0</p><p>And the worst thing is that, if you want my opinion, D&amp;D did not realise what they might have done with Tyrion\u2019s character. They were blind to Dany\u2019s cruelties in the past. She was their heroine up until GRRM said\u00a0\u201chell no, she\u2019s the bad one\u201d. D&amp;D reproduced the same system all over again without even seeing what they did.\u00a0</p><p>Of course, this is only my interpretation (and it might be heavily influenced by my own dislike of Tyrion after Season 8, or by the awful writing). I am open to any comment and/or constructive criticism. But I\u2019m pretty sure that Tyrion is much more dangerous than we thought.</p>",
                "content": "<p>I&rsquo;ve just realised something about Tyrion &ndash; and mind you, it doesn&rsquo;t look good at all.</p><p>I was revolted (and I still am) by Tyrion&rsquo;s attitude in the last episodes, especially the fact that he denounced Varys, which led to his inevitable demise, even though Tyrion <i>knew </i>that Varys was right, that Daenerys was dangerous and that she would burn King&rsquo;s Landing to the ground.</p><p>I was also angry at him for basically doing nothing in the last episode. He acted like a drama queen by throwing his badge away and then encouraged Jon to kill Dany, <i>while he could have kept the badge and done something. </i>Tried to kill Dany himself. Hatched a plan. Actively conspired with Jon. Or even try to kill Dany and, if he failed, make Jon look like Dany&rsquo;s most loyal supporter so that Dany would not suspect a thing &ndash; which is a dumb plan but at least Tyrion would have done something.&nbsp;</p><p>But then I thought about something.</p><h2><b>Tyrion purposefully sent Jon to his own death</b></h2><p>At this point, Jon was the only candidate for the Throne. Varys and Tyrion had talked about it a lot, and I think we can assume that Jon was the only option left. It was maybe not the <i>best </i>option, because Jon being King might have sparked a war, but it was still better than several Lords fighting each other in order to become King. Having a candidate with a good claim and a good reputation was the best option <i>available,&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;and, I daresay, the <i>only </i>option.&nbsp;</p><p>Logically, Tyrion should have hatched a plan or something, prepared some ground for Daenerys&rsquo; fall and for Jon&rsquo;s reign. But no &ndash; he just quit and then told Jon that he had to kill Dany. (Which, for the record, I don&rsquo;t disagree with. I think Dany needed to die. What I dislike is the fact that Tyrion did nothing but sit on his ass and expect other people to do the job.)</p><p>Except that Tyrion knows full well what the punishment for kingslaying is, no matter how cruel the assassinated monarch was. When sending Jon to kill Daenerys, he <i>had </i>to know that Jon would not live long after that. Granted, most Kingdoms would probably not care at all, but the Unsullied and the Dothraki <i>would </i>care, and a Kingslayer was unlikely to become King anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Tyrion was in jail and did not have a way to know what had happened in detail - and yet, he spends time planning on a replacement for Jon. He does not even try to argue that yes, Jon killed Dany but it was justified and the only thing to do, and he happily fails to mention his own role in the murder - to instead walk away unpunished. After Jon killed Daenerys, Tyrion just&hellip; moved on and schemed with another King in mind. So no, you cannot tell me that Tyrion did not know that Jon&rsquo;s actions would likely have him killed. He knew.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>And the worst thing is that Tyrion knew and never tried to think of another option. Not a single second. He was very confident of what he was doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Granted, Tyrion could not know he would survive. But he knew, for sure, that Jon would not, and even if he did he would no longer be a candidate for the Throne.</p><p><i>So Tyrion just sent the only candidate they had for the Throne to his own death and he was aware of it.</i></p><p>And, yeah, OK, bad writing and everything, but the Tyrion scene was not important in itself. Tyrion already had loads of scenes and of talking in this episode. Jon could have talked with Arya - who would have given him the same advice, and who would have helped him - or with Davos - who just did nothing in Season 8 except wanting to kill a woman who only appeared in Episode 2. So I am not sure we can say that it is only a case of bad writing, and that is what makes me so uncomfortable with Tyrion.</p><p>So what was he thinking? I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll never know.

Tyrion loves power, we know that. And he seeks glory as well, thinking himself to be super important in the story when he&rsquo;s not. And he&rsquo;s just as self-righteous as Dany was. If you look at his time as Joffrey&rsquo;s Hand, his decisions were to be respected and he was to have power because he was the one to deserve it, and because he knows better. (You know, he drinks and he knows things.) His choice of Bran as King is to be respected because he knows things and because he&rsquo;s wise and whatever. He gets rid of Jon because&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only thing to do, there&rsquo;s no other choice&rdquo; &ndash; and then he plots for another king that fits his personal criteria, which coincidentally happen to be a replica of <i>Daenerys</i>&rsquo; criteria. You know what it reminds me of?&nbsp;&ldquo;You are not fit to rule. But I am.&rdquo; <i>You are not fit to make decisions and to choose a King, but I am.</i></p><p>This is why Tyrion was so blind to Dany&rsquo;s cruelty, and why it became different for him when she burnt people he knew: because in the end, he would have done things like her. Tyrion has learnt nothing, even though he pretends he had. He keeps committing the same mistakes over and over again.</p><p>Of course, you would say,&nbsp;&ldquo;But Bran knows everything and if he thought that Tyrion was a bad person he would not have taken the Throne or taken Tyrion as Hand&rdquo; and, actually, I think that Bran had no way of knowing that. Bran sees things, he does not feel them. He does not read people&rsquo;s minds. He does not know that Tyrion shares similarities with Dany.</p><p>Because yes, he does.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is that, just like Dany, I don&rsquo;t think he is conscious of it. I don&rsquo;t think he coldly thought&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have Jon killed along with Dany, two birds with one stone, I need to get rid of Jon&rdquo;. He did send him to his likely death, and was certain that he would prevent Jon from being King, but I don&rsquo;t think it was the result of a coldblooded scheme to get rid of Jon. I think that Tyrion is like Dany in this respect. He thought it was necessary. He justified it by telling it was the only thing left to do. And after all, he ensured that Jon did not die, and Jon didn&rsquo;t want that Throne anyway, did he? So, no harm done.&nbsp;</p><p>I am sure this is Tyrion&rsquo;s reasoning. He chooses Bran because he thinks it&rsquo;s the best choice. He handles his government in a certain way because he&rsquo;s certain that this is the best thing to do. Because just like Daenerys, he&rsquo;s proud and he thinks he&rsquo;s always right. And just like Daenerys, he has a way to seduce people into, if not following him, at least listening to him.&nbsp;</p><p><i>And if people agree with him then he&rsquo;s doing things right, isn&rsquo;t he?</i></p><h2><b>Conclusion - Tyrion has the potential to be your everyday villain, just like Dany</b></h2><p>I don&rsquo;t think Tyrion was smiling in a satisfied, evil way and rubbing his hands together because everything went according to plan. He is exactly the type of villain that Dany was. The type that people (both in the show and in the audience) can like, the type that is relatable. The type that does not do bad things because he&rsquo;s evil but because he thinks it&rsquo;s the only way and because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. The type that does not realise that he&rsquo;s doing bad things; and when he does, he thinks he has to do so nevertheless for&nbsp;&ldquo;the greater good&rdquo;. <i>He is just like Dany.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Of course, Tyrion will not end up burning cities to the ground. No, I see him making decisions that might have disastrous consequences - starvation, revolts, wars, things like that. If we&rsquo;re lucky, maybe Bran will be able to prevent it from happening. I think maybe Tyrion will not even commit such mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>But he has the <i>potential </i>to commit them, because he makes horrible decisions that he feels are justified (like sending Jon to his own death), because he always turns things to his own advantage, because he likes power, because he reproduces a tyrannical system, <i>because he does not realise it</i>, because he has fallen in the same trap than Dany - that is, thinking that he is the hero.&nbsp;</p><p>And the worst thing is that, if you want my opinion, D&amp;D did not realise what they might have done with Tyrion&rsquo;s character. They were blind to Dany&rsquo;s cruelties in the past. She was their heroine up until GRRM said&nbsp;&ldquo;hell no, she&rsquo;s the bad one&rdquo;. D&amp;D reproduced the same system all over again without even seeing what they did.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this is only my interpretation (and it might be heavily influenced by my own dislike of Tyrion after Season 8, or by the awful writing). I am open to any comment and/or constructive criticism. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Tyrion is much more dangerous than we thought.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve just realised something about Tyrion &ndash; and mind you, it doesn&rsquo;t look good at all.</p>\n<p>I was revolted (and I still am) by Tyrion&rsquo;s attitude in the last episodes, especially the fact that he denounced Varys, which led to his inevitable demise, even though Tyrion <i>knew </i>that Varys was right, that Daenerys was dangerous and that she would burn King&rsquo;s Landing to the ground.</p>\n<p>I was also angry at him for basically doing nothing in the last episode. He acted like a drama queen by throwing his badge away and then encouraged Jon to kill Dany, <i>while he could have kept the badge and done something. </i>Tried to kill Dany himself. Hatched a plan. Actively conspired with Jon. Or even try to kill Dany and, if he failed, make Jon look like Dany&rsquo;s most loyal supporter so that Dany would not suspect a thing &ndash; which is a dumb plan but at least Tyrion would have done something.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But then I thought about something.</p>\n</p>",
