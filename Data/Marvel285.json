There was chaos in your house, chairs being moved and squeaking as they glide across the wooden floor, high heels were clacking against the wood, makeup that was placed on the table was being shuffled through. You let it all happen, unbothered, knowing everyone there is taking care of you and making you look as good as you can for the awards show in five hours.</p><p>Zendaya, also known as one of your closest friends, was talking to you from the other side of the table. Your eyes were focused on your phone, scrolling through Instagram but still listening intently to the words that were coming out of Zendaya\u2019s mouth. The hair clips in your hair were placed comfortably on your head, making you look like a child with pigtails on when the hair stylist was curling it. Zendaya laughed at you, taking a picture of the scene in front of her and posting it on her Instagram story.</p><p>\u201cHey dude, you should meet Zac Efron.\u201d She brought up casually in conversation. You looked up at her, furrowing your eyebrows and widening your eyes a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me he wants to meet you and I told him I\u2019d introduce you to him. So basically, you\u2018re already going to meet him, I don\u2019t know why I asked.\u201d Zendaya let out a breathy laugh, causing you to reciprocate but roll your eyes as well. \u201cHe\u2019s super cool anyway, you\u2019d love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is, but Z, he\u2019s literally like one of the most famous people ever. You do realize you\u2019re talking about <i>the</i> Troy Bolton.\u201c She shrugged, shaking her head at you with a sarcastic grin.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>You pursed your lips and shrugged as well, continuing your scrolling online. The person working on your hair moved over to your side, letting the makeup artist work on applying the foundation to your face.</p><p>\u201cWho knows, you might just fall in love.\u201d</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>The white car stopped in front of the event, the chauffeur saying their farewell to the two of you. After thanking them, both you and Zendaya stepped out from the same side. You helped Zendaya by holding out your hand, and she took it, using her other hand to clutch her dress. The interviewers were quick to arrive, already asking questions from the moment you opened the door. Nevertheless, you still smiled politely and stopped for a minute to be interviewed.</p><p>The two of you walked on the red carpet, waving to the fans that were standing behind the small barricade that stood between you. Some people were shoving cameras into your faces, trying to get the inside scoop to your personal lives. You simply dodged the questions with ease, losing Zendaya during the answers when she drifted away to be photographed. Excusing yourself, you made your way to the main carpet, posing for the cameras in front of you.</p><p>As you entered the venue, you looked around for Zendaya but found other people you know, greeting them with a warm smile and making small talk. Meanwhile, Zendaya had found Zac Efron and was having a conversation with him, getting him ready to meet you. He really was excited to finally meet you, having been supporting you from afar and admiring all of your work. You were also absolutely stunning, it was no surprise that he thought so.</p><p>After finally catching a glimpse of Zendaya\u2019s tall figure from across the room, you walked to her, waving at a few people along the way. Once you made it there, you nervously smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, I thought I lost you back there. Was starting to get worried.\u201d You stated, looking into Zendaya\u2019s eyes. You turned and looked at Zac, a huge smile placed on your face.</p><p>\u201cY/N, this is Zac. Zac, this is\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N. The beautiful star of M/N. Big fan.\u201d He stuck out his hand, gently taking yours and pressing a soft kiss upon it. You blushed, placing your other hand on your chest and posing for the camera that took a picture of you two. He pulled away and smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cIt really is amazing to meet a fan.\u201d You replied. He laughed, shaking his head slightly. \u201cBut seriously, you\u2019re making my childhood dream come true. I\u2019m over here meeting Troy Bolton!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever, doubt your dream will ever come true? Did you ever&hellip;I forgot the rest.\u201d He sang his iconic song slightly and laughed. It clicked in your head, making you gasp and almost drop your drink.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day of my entire fucking life.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the night consisted of you and Zac hanging out when you could. It wasn\u2019t awkward at all between you. You would be talking about something that recently had happened, and stood up together whenever Zendaya would win an award. It was all fun and games, up until it was time to go and you had to go through the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Is Zac Efron your rebound? Is he replacing Tom Holland now?\u201d You tensed up at the loud voice questioning you, your eyebrows furrowing in shock. That name hadn\u2019t crossed your mind the entire night and it hit you like a train when you finally heard it. You looked around, Zac grabbing your wrist and gently pulling you with him into the car with Zendaya.</p><p>\u201cShit, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve said something, I just\u2014\u201c You shook your head at Zendaya, a crooked smile on your face as you tried to find light in the situation.</p><p>\u201cDude I\u2019m totally fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Zac asked, the concern evidently on his face. You nodded, elbowing him playfully.</p><p>\u201cOf course, can\u2019t wait to kick your ass at Mario Party.\u201d You retorted and Zac smirked, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>You were pacing around in your room, your finger in your mouth as you nervously chewed on your nails. Zendaya sat on the bed, her eyes trained on you with worry.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re nervous but you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d She spoke, titling her head slightly and curling the corners of her lips downwards.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think I can face him.\u201d She sighed at you, knowing exactly well the reason you\u2019re nervous.</p><p>Tomorrow is the first day of filming for the new Spiderman movie, Far From Home. Since you were an actress from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you were going to make an appearance as Peter Parker\u2019s love interest/partner in crime. Sure, it is completely normal for someone to be completely anxiety-ridden before acting in a huge movie that was pegged to make millions of dollars. Although this was a huge reason of your freak-out, there was also another.</p><p>Tom Holland was the actor who played Peter Parker in the new Spiderman movie franchise. He became extremely well-known after his debut in Captain America: Civil War, which is where the two of you had met. Your character was fighting alongside Tony Stark, having met Peter Parker due to being on the same team. It was obvious that both of your characters had chemistry and the writers were heading towards the two of you becoming an iconic teen couple.</p><p>But the situation was that your characters weren\u2019t the only ones who had chemistry. You and Tom Holland were also crushing on each other during the filming process. It isn\u2019t surprising, many actors get together after acting intimately on screen.</p><p>So the two of you got together after the year of filming and after the year of becoming best friends. The both of you were so comfortable with each other, hanging out most of the week and having an absolute blast every single time. Everything was so much more fun when the two of you were together, making the older actors laugh at your outgoing behavior. There was always a slightly flirty tone in your voices when you made jokes, and the teasing from the other actors continued until you both finally decided to start going out.</p><p>So far it seems as if the both of you would live happily ever after with no problem, but the problems arose when you had to move away to Iceland and film another movie outside of the MCU while Tom had to film Avengers: Infinity War. You were completely fine with keeping a long-distance relationship, claiming that you\u2019re still so in love with him and you want to stay with him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think the same. He loved you, but he couldn\u2019t keep up with having to manage having a girlfriend and filming at the same time. He felt as if he had to prioritize one over the other and he felt it wasn\u2019t fair for either of you. The guilt was eating away at him for weeks, until he finally spoke to you about the problem, ending things off with you through an argument.</p><p>You wished it didn\u2019t end that way, but things were piling up on both of you and you blew up on each other. The screaming over the phone, the heat burning at your faces, the break in your hearts. It was overwhelming, so you two ended it right then and there with a harsh \u2018fuck you\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a year since you last talked to Tom, your anger no longer there and your heartbreak is already healed. The only problem was that you haven\u2019t spoken to Tom, or even try to speak to him. Your pride was constantly beating you up, yelling in your ear about how if he wanted to talk, he would have messaged first. You wanted to say happy birthday, you wanted to say merry Christmas, you wanted to say happy new year, but you never did.</p><p>Now it\u2019s the day before filming and you\u2019re crying. You\u2019re letting go of all your frustrations into Zendaya\u2019s shoulder. You\u2019re letting go of all your insecurities, anxiety, and fear through your tears. You felt like a high school girl, avoiding your ex boyfriend because he did you wrong. You wanted to be mature about the situation and prepare for your role but knowing that you had to act like you\u2019re in love with Tom was nerve-wracking.</p><p>So there you sat, your stomach nauseated with butterflies and your head pounding as the tears stuck to your cheeks. You were exhausted and you hated that the reason was because of him.</p><p>-</p><p><b><a href=\"https://melancholland.tumblr.com/post/177417316734/the-greatest-lie-part-two-th\">part two</a></b></p>",

There was chaos in your house, chairs being moved and squeaking as they glide across the wooden floor, high heels were clacking against the wood, makeup that was placed on the table was being shuffled through. You let it all happen, unbothered, knowing everyone there is taking care of you and making you look as good as you can for the awards show in five hours.</p><p>Zendaya, also known as one of your closest friends, was talking to you from the other side of the table. Your eyes were focused on your phone, scrolling through Instagram but still listening intently to the words that were coming out of Zendaya\u2019s mouth. The hair clips in your hair were placed comfortably on your head, making you look like a child with pigtails on when the hair stylist was curling it. Zendaya laughed at you, taking a picture of the scene in front of her and posting it on her Instagram story.</p><p>\u201cHey dude, you should meet Zac Efron.\u201d She brought up casually in conversation. You looked up at her, furrowing your eyebrows and widening your eyes a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me he wants to meet you and I told him I\u2019d introduce you to him. So basically, you\u2018re already going to meet him, I don\u2019t know why I asked.\u201d Zendaya let out a breathy laugh, causing you to reciprocate but roll your eyes as well. \u201cHe\u2019s super cool anyway, you\u2019d love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is, but Z, he\u2019s literally like one of the most famous people ever. You do realize you\u2019re talking about <i>the</i> Troy Bolton.\u201c She shrugged, shaking her head at you with a sarcastic grin.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>You pursed your lips and shrugged as well, continuing your scrolling online. The person working on your hair moved over to your side, letting the makeup artist work on applying the foundation to your face.</p><p>\u201cWho knows, you might just fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The white car stopped in front of the event, the chauffeur saying their farewell to the two of you. After thanking them, both you and Zendaya stepped out from the same side. You helped Zendaya by holding out your hand, and she took it, using her other hand to clutch her dress. The interviewers were quick to arrive, already asking questions from the moment you opened the door. Nevertheless, you still smiled politely and stopped for a minute to be interviewed.</p><p>The two of you walked on the red carpet, waving to the fans that were standing behind the small barricade that stood between you. Some people were shoving cameras into your faces, trying to get the inside scoop to your personal lives. You simply dodged the questions with ease, losing Zendaya during the answers when she drifted away to be photographed. Excusing yourself, you made your way to the main carpet, posing for the cameras in front of you.</p><p>As you entered the venue, you looked around for Zendaya but found other people you know, greeting them with a warm smile and making small talk. Meanwhile, Zendaya had found Zac Efron and was having a conversation with him, getting him ready to meet you. He really was excited to finally meet you, having been supporting you from afar and admiring all of your work. You were also absolutely stunning, it was no surprise that he thought so.</p><p>After finally catching a glimpse of Zendaya\u2019s tall figure from across the room, you walked to her, waving at a few people along the way. Once you made it there, you nervously smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey, I thought I lost you back there. Was starting to get worried.\u201d You stated, looking into Zendaya\u2019s eyes. You turned and looked at Zac, a huge smile placed on your face.</p><p>\u201cY/N, this is Zac. Zac, this is\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cY/N Y/L/N. The beautiful star of M/N. Big fan.\u201d He stuck out his hand, gently taking yours and pressing a soft kiss upon it. You blushed, placing your other hand on your chest and posing for the camera that took a picture of you two. He pulled away and smiled at you.</p><p>\u201cIt really is amazing to meet a fan.\u201d You replied. He laughed, shaking his head slightly. \u201cBut seriously, you\u2019re making my childhood dream come true. I\u2019m over here meeting Troy Bolton!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever, doubt your dream will ever come true? Did you ever\u2026I forgot the rest.\u201d He sang his iconic song slightly and laughed. It clicked in your head, making you gasp and almost drop your drink.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best day of my entire fucking life.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the night consisted of you and Zac hanging out when you could. It wasn\u2019t awkward at all between you. You would be talking about something that recently had happened, and stood up together whenever Zendaya would win an award. It was all fun and games, up until it was time to go and you had to go through the red carpet.</p><p>\u201cY/N! Y/N! Is Zac Efron your rebound? Is he replacing Tom Holland now?\u201d You tensed up at the loud voice questioning you, your eyebrows furrowing in shock. That name hadn\u2019t crossed your mind the entire night and it hit you like a train when you finally heard it. You looked around, Zac grabbing your wrist and gently pulling you with him into the car with Zendaya.</p><p>\u201cShit, Y/N. I\u2019m sorry, I should\u2019ve said something, I just\u2014\u201c You shook your head at Zendaya, a crooked smile on your face as you tried to find light in the situation.</p><p>\u201cDude I\u2019m totally fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Zac asked, the concern evidently on his face. You nodded, elbowing him playfully.</p><p>\u201cOf course, can\u2019t wait to kick your ass at Mario Party.\u201d You retorted and Zac smirked, rolling his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>\u2026</p><p>You were pacing around in your room, your finger in your mouth as you nervously chewed on your nails. Zendaya sat on the bed, her eyes trained on you with worry.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re nervous but you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d She spoke, titling her head slightly and curling the corners of her lips downwards.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think I can face him.\u201d She sighed at you, knowing exactly well the reason you\u2019re nervous.</p><p>Tomorrow is the first day of filming for the new Spiderman movie, Far From Home. Since you were an actress from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you were going to make an appearance as Peter Parker\u2019s love interest/partner in crime. Sure, it is completely normal for someone to be completely anxiety-ridden before acting in a huge movie that was pegged to make millions of dollars. Although this was a huge reason of your freak-out, there was also another.</p><p>Tom Holland was the actor who played Peter Parker in the new Spiderman movie franchise. He became extremely well-known after his debut in Captain America: Civil War, which is where the two of you had met. Your character was fighting alongside Tony Stark, having met Peter Parker due to being on the same team. It was obvious that both of your characters had chemistry and the writers were heading towards the two of you becoming an iconic teen couple.</p><p>But the situation was that your characters weren\u2019t the only ones who had chemistry. You and Tom Holland were also crushing on each other during the filming process. It isn\u2019t surprising, many actors get together after acting intimately on screen.</p><p>So the two of you got together after the year of filming and after the year of becoming best friends. The both of you were so comfortable with each other, hanging out most of the week and having an absolute blast every single time. Everything was so much more fun when the two of you were together, making the older actors laugh at your outgoing behavior. There was always a slightly flirty tone in your voices when you made jokes, and the teasing from the other actors continued until you both finally decided to start going out.</p><p>So far it seems as if the both of you would live happily ever after with no problem, but the problems arose when you had to move away to Iceland and film another movie outside of the MCU while Tom had to film Avengers: Infinity War. You were completely fine with keeping a long-distance relationship, claiming that you\u2019re still so in love with him and you want to stay with him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think the same. He loved you, but he couldn\u2019t keep up with having to manage having a girlfriend and filming at the same time. He felt as if he had to prioritize one over the other and he felt it wasn\u2019t fair for either of you. The guilt was eating away at him for weeks, until he finally spoke to you about the problem, ending things off with you through an argument.</p><p>You wished it didn\u2019t end that way, but things were piling up on both of you and you blew up on each other. The screaming over the phone, the heat burning at your faces, the break in your hearts. It was overwhelming, so you two ended it right then and there with a harsh \u2018fuck you\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a year since you last talked to Tom, your anger no longer there and your heartbreak is already healed. The only problem was that you haven\u2019t spoken to Tom, or even try to speak to him. Your pride was constantly beating you up, yelling in your ear about how if he wanted to talk, he would have messaged first. You wanted to say happy birthday, you wanted to say merry Christmas, you wanted to say happy new year, but you never did.</p><p>Now it\u2019s the day before filming and you\u2019re crying. You\u2019re letting go of all your frustrations into Zendaya\u2019s shoulder. You\u2019re letting go of all your insecurities, anxiety, and fear through your tears. You felt like a high school girl, avoiding your ex boyfriend because he did you wrong. You wanted to be mature about the situation and prepare for your role but knowing that you had to act like you\u2019re in love with Tom was nerve-wracking.</p><p>So there you sat, your stomach nauseated with butterflies and your head pounding as the tears stuck to your cheeks. You were exhausted and you hated that the reason was because of him.</p><p>-</p><p><b><a href=\"https://melancholland.tumblr.com/post/177417316734/the-greatest-lie-part-two-th\">part two</a></b></p></p>",
