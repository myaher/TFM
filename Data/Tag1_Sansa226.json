I\u2019d like to visit the godswood.\u201d And then he says,\u00a0\u201cOf course, of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.\u201d And then she says,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t pray anymore. It\u2019s the only place I can go where people don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>But then 15 minutes later, we see not one but two shots of Sansa at prayer in the show\u2019s version of the King\u2019s Landing godswood. We can even seen her lips moving in the first shot, just as Ned Stark\u2019s lips moved in spoken prayer just before he was beheaded.</p><p>So Sansa lied to Tyrion. She does pray. She prayed in season three as well, and when Margaery Tyrell asked her about it, Sansa was unusually firm in her refusal to disclose the subject of her prayers. Sansa was, at that stage, highly compliant and susceptible to manipulation, but Marge\u2019s best efforts failed. Which tells me that Sansa\u2019s prayers are very important <i>at least to Sansa.</i></p><p>And then, in 6x10 we have a third, similar scene scene. After the Starks reclaim Winterfell, Littlefinger seeks out Sansa in the snowy godswood.\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/332c5d744ed4ceb91e06f0fb2fc59050/tumblr_inline_pi7g0l2mAm1tfxxpr_540.png\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed78359d7e5faae3a7e26889fab06e92/tumblr_inline_pi7qltY7Qb1tfxxpr_540.png\" class=\"\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/332c5d744ed4ceb91e06f0fb2fc59050/tumblr_inline_pi7g0l2mAm1tfxxpr_540.png\"/></figure><p>It\u2019s a beautiful shot and Sansa sits in the <i>exact</i> same spot as Ned sat in episode one. Baelish approaches her and his first words assume her piety: \u201cForgive me, my lady, if you\u2019re at prayer.\u201d And she says, as world-weary and jaded as can be,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m done with all that.\u201d<br/></p><p>But I sincerely doubt that\u2019s true. I think Sansa hides her prayer from people now\u2013this is a pattern of three. Perhaps it\u2019s because in the years she was alone in King\u2019s Landing, she was mocked roundly by the Lannisters for prayer.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The Lannisters are quite godless\u2013they believe in themselves\u2013and Cersei mocked her for praying during the Battle of the Blackwater, whereas Tyrion believed that Sansa was insulting him when she said that she would pray for his safe return, just as she prayed for the King\u2019s. (OK, that might have been right.)<br/><br/>I\u2019m not sure what all this adds up to, but I suspect:<br/></p><p>(a) Sansa\u2019s faith and practice of prayer/meditation/quiet contemplation will appear in season 8.</p><p>(b) Her\u00a0\u201cfaith\u201d has a very personal aspect to it which we do not yet understand. My personal hunch is that it\u2019s one of the channels through which her warg/skinchanger powers manifest. Bran goes fully unconscious (until he becomes the Three-Eyed Raven) but I suspect Sansa can do it while\u00a0\u201cawake\u201d but in a kind of fugue state. See also moments in the books like when she seems to fade out after Sandor leaves her at the Battle of the Blackwater and when she apparently passes out in the Eyrie godswood.</p><p><b>tl;dr: <i>Sansa\u2019s practice of secret prayer has a magical aspect that will be crucial in season eight.</i></b></p>",

        "body": "<p>So, Sansa\u2019s first<i> AFFC</i> chapter includes a list of the sad songs Marillion sings from his sky cell. \u00a0There is ten songs mentioned, of which three are only given descriptions (which I almost believe might be important), and six of which are only given titles, so I\u2019m going to talk about the tenth. \u00a0That song is <i>\u201cOn a Misty Morn\u201d</i>, about a mother looking for a son she can\u2019t find after a battle. \u00a0It\u2019s significant as the only one mentioned that is also given lyrics, one of only a handful of songs in the series with official lyrics.<b><br/></b></p><blockquote><p>Here are the lyrics:</p><p><i>Oh, have you seen my boy, good ser?<br/>His hair is chestnut brown<br/>He&rsquo;d promised he&rsquo;d come back to me<br/>Our home&rsquo;s in Wendish Town.</i></p></blockquote><p>Now I was just going disregard this as just another song used for world immersion, but Wendish Town is an actual town in the Riverlands. \u00a0It\u2019s mentioned in <i>AGOT</i> as one of the place ravaged by the Mountain and his men. \u00a0But where is it in the Riverlands? \u00a0It has two semi-canonical locations, either just south of the Blue Fork (if you\u2019re going off the <i>Game of Thrones</i> official map) or the Green Fork (if you go by the <i>ASOIAF Roleplay Campaign Guide</i>). I\u2019m going by the <i>GOT</i> map location, because it fits better with the bit of information given to us about it. \u00a0It being on the Blue Fork puts it closer to the Mummer\u2019s Fort and Sherrer (the other locations attacked) as well as closer to Castle Darry, their liege lords. \u00a0So I\u2019m putting it on the Blue Fork as well. \u00a0Now to the point, I know it seems so far away.</p><p>I believe Sansa is going to Wendish Town in <i>TWOW</i>. \u00a0We all know Sansa doesn\u2019t have much time left in the Vale, and that she is likely the girl in grey heading for Jon. \u00a0The show more or less spelled this out, whether I choose to like the show or not. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to talk about the color of Sansa\u2019s cloak, because I\u2019m not about beating her dying horse. \u00a0I\u2019m going to talk about how she\u2019s making it North. \u00a0The answer is a ship for at least part of the way. \u00a0The only other way would be to try and ride that, and I don\u2019t see Sansa trying to go through the Twins. \u00a0So she needs a port town. \u00a0Spoiler: it\u2019s Wendish Town.</p><p>Sansa is at the Gates of the Moon as a her <i>TWOW</i> spoiler chapter, and from there the closest ports are to her north, south, and east. \u00a0Why doesn\u2019t she go to any of those? \u00a0North and south are blocked by mountains, and the Hill Tribes are more ferocious than ever because of Tyrion. \u00a0She could go to Gulltown to the east, but that would be the first place someone would assume she\u2019d go. \u00a0That sends her west past the Bloody Gate and down the High Road towards the Trident.\u00a0 Now she\u2019s in trouble, she\u2019s in the Riverlands and they\u2019ve been on fire since Wendish Town was first mentioned, so she has to pick a direction quick.\u00a0 And the only choice is deeper into outlaw territory.\u00a0 Going east towards the Bay of Crabs isn\u2019t a option, the Saltpans are basically on fire and it\u2019s Lannister land. \u00a0The Red Fork leads her to the Lannister held Riverrun, the Green Fork leads her to the Frey held Twins, the means the middle path is her only option. \u00a0And what is the middle path but the Blue Fork. \u00a0</p><p>Which is where Wendish Town likely lies, and being just off the Blue Fork, and just south of Seagard, means more likely than not Wendish Town is a port town. \u00a0From there, Sansa can get passage either to Seagard that the Shadow Tower, or less likely straight to the Shadow Tower. \u00a0Now we know, she isn\u2019t going to make it there by boat. \u00a0The winter winds have caused even the most experience crews to crash recently, and the stony sept is already dangerous because of the Ironmen in the water. \u00a0So the boat crashes, more probably off the Stony Shore because of those Ironborn I just mentioned last sentence. \u00a0Which puts her in the Wolfswood, and back up on her dying horse.</p><p>Let\u2019s backtrack a bit though, because there\u2019s something else in the same area as Wendish Town. \u00a0Well someone, well someones. I\u2019ve been ignoring them since the start of this thing.\u00a0 You know what Sansa has to pass through to get to the coast? \u00a0Fairmarket, the last known general area of the former Lady Catelyn, now known as the Lady Stoneheart. \u00a0I won\u2019t focus more on this because I\u2019ve already seen metas written about Sansa coming across Lady Stoneheart and the effects it could have on Sansa or Sansa could have on her. \u00a0It\u2019s a meta for another day, probably from someone better than me who wouldn\u2019t write a meta about a town whose claim to fame is a sad song someone sings just before they die. \u00a0Jaime and Brienne are also there too if they\u2019re still alive, which is fortune because they were in fact looking for her. \u00a0Saves them a bit of trouble.</p><p>Now is there any of hints in the song itself? \u00a0Somewhat. \u00a0While it is a mother looking for her son in the song, the meaning is hits about as well. \u00a0Like the mother, Sansa is searching for a family member who is likely dead. \u00a0They\u2019re both full of grief. \u00a0There is the mention of chestnut hair, a color similar to the burnt brown Sansa describes her hair being once it\u2019s dyed.</p><p>Then there is use of the word \u201cmisty\u201d in title. \u00a0The Misty in the song\u2019s title could be a reference to the bay mist from Ironmen\u2019s Bay, but it\u2019s also a reference to the mother in the song; her eyes misty with tears for her son. \u00a0It could also be a reference to someone confused or lost, maybe in reference to Sansa. Less flushed out then Wendish Town, I know. \u00a0I wanted to close on a high point while also justifying calling this <i>\u201cSansa Stark and the Misty Morn\u201d</i> because it\u2019s a better title than my other idea which was <i>\u201cA Funny Thing Happened on Sansa\u2019s Way to Wendish Town\u201d</i>.</p><p>Last note, Wendish Town probably doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the historical Wends. \u00a0I\u2019m done now though, you can close this page or continuing scrolling past half reading.</p>",

I\u2019m going by the <i>GOT</i> map location, because it fits better with the bit of information given to us about it. \u00a0It being on the Blue Fork puts it closer to the Mummer\u2019s Fort and Sherrer (the other locations attacked) as well as closer to Castle Darry, their liege lords. \u00a0So I\u2019m putting it on the Blue Fork as well. \u00a0Now to the point, I know it seems so far away.</p><p>I believe Sansa is going to Wendish Town in <i>TWOW</i>. \u00a0We all know Sansa doesn\u2019t have much time left in the Vale, and that she is likely the girl in grey heading for Jon. \u00a0The show more or less spelled this out, whether I choose to like the show or not. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to talk about the color of Sansa\u2019s cloak, because I\u2019m not about beating her dying horse. \u00a0I\u2019m going to talk about how she\u2019s making it North. \u00a0The answer is a ship for at least part of the way. \u00a0The only other way would be to try and ride that, and I don\u2019t see Sansa trying to go through the Twins. \u00a0So she needs a port town. \u00a0Spoiler: it\u2019s Wendish Town.</p><p>Sansa is at the Gates of the Moon as a her <i>TWOW</i> spoiler chapter, and from there the closest ports are to her north, south, and east. \u00a0Why doesn\u2019t she go to any of those? \u00a0North and south are blocked by mountains, and the Hill Tribes are more ferocious than ever because of Tyrion. \u00a0She could go to Gulltown to the east, but that would be the first place someone would assume she\u2019d go. \u00a0That sends her west past the Bloody Gate and down the High Road towards the Trident.\u00a0 Now she\u2019s in trouble, she\u2019s in the Riverlands and they\u2019ve been on fire since Wendish Town was first mentioned, so she has to pick a direction quick.\u00a0 And the only choice is deeper into outlaw territory.\u00a0 Going east towards the Bay of Crabs isn\u2019t a option, the Saltpans are basically on fire and it\u2019s Lannister land. \u00a0The Red Fork leads her to the Lannister held Riverrun, the Green Fork leads her to the Frey held Twins, the means the middle path is her only option. \u00a0And what is the middle path but the Blue Fork. \u00a0</p><p>Which is where Wendish Town likely lies, and being just off the Blue Fork, and just south of Seagard, means more likely than not Wendish Town is a port town. \u00a0From there, Sansa can get passage either to Seagard that the Shadow Tower, or less likely straight to the Shadow Tower. \u00a0Now we know, she isn\u2019t going to make it there by boat. \u00a0The winter winds have caused even the most experience crews to crash recently, and the stony sept is already dangerous because of the Ironmen in the water. \u00a0So the boat crashes, more probably off the Stony Shore because of those Ironborn I just mentioned last sentence. \u00a0Which puts her in the Wolfswood, and back up on her dying horse.</p><p>Let\u2019s backtrack a bit though, because there\u2019s something else in the same area as Wendish Town. \u00a0Well someone, well someones. I\u2019ve been ignoring them since the start of this thing.\u00a0 You know what Sansa has to pass through to get to the coast? \u00a0Fairmarket, the last known general area of the former Lady Catelyn, now known as the Lady Stoneheart. \u00a0I won\u2019t focus more on this because I\u2019ve already seen metas written about Sansa coming across Lady Stoneheart and the effects it could have on Sansa or Sansa could have on her. \u00a0It\u2019s a meta for another day, probably from someone better than me who wouldn\u2019t write a meta about a town whose claim to fame is a sad song someone sings just before they die. \u00a0Jaime and Brienne are also there too if they\u2019re still alive, which is fortune because they were in fact looking for her. \u00a0Saves them a bit of trouble.</p><p>Now is there any of hints in the song itself? \u00a0Somewhat. \u00a0While it is a mother looking for her son in the song, the meaning is hits about as well. \u00a0Like the mother, Sansa is searching for a family member who is likely dead. \u00a0They\u2019re both full of grief. \u00a0There is the mention of chestnut hair, a color similar to the burnt brown Sansa describes her hair being once it\u2019s dyed.</p><p>Then there is use of the word \u201cmisty\u201d in title. \u00a0The Misty in the song\u2019s title could be a reference to the bay mist from Ironmen\u2019s Bay, but it\u2019s also a reference to the mother in the song; her eyes misty with tears for her son. \u00a0It could also be a reference to someone confused or lost, maybe in reference to Sansa. Less flushed out then Wendish Town, I know. \u00a0I wanted to close on a high point while also justifying calling this <i>\u201cSansa Stark and the Misty Morn\u201d</i> because it\u2019s a better title than my other idea which was <i>\u201cA Funny Thing Happened on Sansa\u2019s Way to Wendish Town\u201d</i>.</p><p>Last note, Wendish Town probably doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the historical Wends. \u00a0I\u2019m done now though, you can close this page or continuing scrolling past half reading.</p>",

He&rsquo;s there to genuinely protect her, to keep her company sometimes even, and to let her feel safe. He doesn&rsquo;t do it for honor or because he&rsquo;s going to get &ldquo;something&rdquo; from it, <i>he does it for Sansa</i>. It&rsquo;s an honorable and innocent devotion he has for her.
