There are days he wishes Wanda had done it for real, and left him dead, and there are days he wishes Bobbi had just killed him in his bed, and there are days he wishes Kate would come home and tell him she loves him and that it\u2019s all okay. </p><p>He wishes Kate hadn\u2019t taken Lucky. He would be able to survive without her just fine - she\u2019s hardly the first young attractive woman to see the greener grass - but that\u2019s his <i>dog.</i> His goddamn dog. He paid good money - okay, no, he threatened good people to save Lucky\u2019s life. </p><p>He groans and flings his forearm over his eyes. None of his friends are good enough people to be<i> worried </i>about him, but Tony keeps texting asking if he wants to spar, which means Tony wants to beat him up so Hawkeye starts appearing on the streets again. </p><p>Clint is tired. </p><hr><p>And when he finally makes it out of bed - at two in the afternoon, which is perfectly acceptable thank-you-very-much - there\u2019s a kid in a green hoodie, covered in blood, eating Lucky Charms at <i>his </i>kitchen table and playing with <i>his </i>trickshot arrows, reading <i>his </i>mission reports about the Russians. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cereal,\u201d Clint says. In his line of work, he\u2019s becoming desensitised to kids covered in blood. Probably not good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give it back but I don\u2019t want to barf,\u201d the kid says. He finishes the bowl faster than Clint can blink, and leaves nothing left, not even a puddle of milk. With a rattle, the bowl appears beside the dishes, and the kid is a little out of breath. </p><p>Fucking <i>speedsters. </i></p><p>\u201cWho are you? Like, not to be rude, or whatever, but doesn\u2019t Xavier usually house muties with injuries?\u201d Clint wants to do something with his hands but the kid washed the bowl and the place is too much of a mess for him to even consider tidying up, so he just grabs an arrow from the floor and starts pushing the tip against his thumb until it hurts. </p><p>\u201cMe and Xavier aren\u2019t on speaking terms,\u201d the kid says. The patch of blood is getting bigger quicker than they normally do, and Clint considers himself sort of an expert on patches of blood. \u201cKate told me to come here if I was fucked and I am fucked but she isn\u2019t here so you\u2019re gonna have to do and can you sew you better be able to sew or I\u2019ll be dead and the Scarlet Witch will <i>eat you.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cI can sew,\u201d Clint says. Ignores that bit about Kate. Thinking about Kate hurts. \u201cWhat do you want me to sew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d says the kid, and strips off his hoodie; underneath is just a lot of skin, and a lot of blood. \u201cSew me up quick before I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die,\u201d Clint says. Bedside manner. What bedside manner? Bobbi used to tell him he\u2019d kill a corpse in a cemetery with the dullness of his voice - he\u2019s terrible at sounding comforting. </p><p>The kid smiles. His skin is pale, but that\u2019s probably blood loss, and his hair is white, although that mostly seems to be a side effect of speedsters, and his face is familiar although Clint doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever met him before. He\u2019s maybe\u2026 seventeen. A little younger than Kate. \u201cI\u2019ll die because I\u2019m a speedster,\u201d he says - in that way Pietro does, talking at a normal speed but with such a drawl that it\u2019s probably slow. \u201cI bleed out faster than snails so can you sew because I\u2019m going to die by tomorrow if you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Life or death. Clint can do life or death. It\u2019s the bits in between he has trouble coping with. \u201cLie on the table,\u201d he says, sweeping all the old breakfast bowls and pizza boxes and newspaper clippings aside, \u201cI\u2019ll get the needle and thread.\u201d </p><p>The kid is called Tommy. Clint doesn\u2019t ask for last names, and Tommy doesn\u2019t tell, although Clint thinks he remembers Wanda saying something about a boy called Tommy, and that explains why the kid invoked the hallowed name. Scarlet Witch. </p><p>She\u2019s already killed Clint once, Clint doesn\u2019t say. </p><p>And the kid has a high threshold for pain, too. Clint remembers getting stitches without anaesthesia, and they hurt like fuck, and although he hadn\u2019t said anything he remembers almost kicking Natasha in the face when she jabbed the needle in too hard. The kid just stuffs the sleeve of his hoodie in his mouth and makes the motion: carry on, and when Clint knows he\u2019s hurting him, pushing too hard or pulling too tight, the kid hardly moves, just twitching at the worst parts. </p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Clint says. His hands are covered in blood and so is his kitchen table, but the kid is refreshingly skin-coloured. \u201cYou can borrow my clothes and I\u2019ll wash your jacket.\u201d</p><p>The kid hands the hoodie over, and Clint tosses a purple one his way.</p><p>And when he looks around the kid is gone again. </p><p>***</p><p>Tony is a bad friend. Clint is a bad friend, too, so it\u2019s okay, and when they\u2019re finished beating each other up Tony says, \u201cThe littler Hawkeye is doing pretty good on her own, man,\u201d Clint nods and smiles and kicks a crumpled beer can on his way back to the flat. </p><p>Tommy is perched on his table, eating cereal. Wearing the Hawkeye hoodie. Clint thinks Tony might have bought it for him, because Tony thinks people wearing their own merchandise is a funny quirk as opposed to something hopelessly narcissistic, and Clint is too lazy to throw it out. \u201cThanks for last time,\u201d says Tommy, when the cereal is done and the bowl is washed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my brother I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know your brother, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows my brother.\u201d Tommy\u2019s face looks ugly for a second. \u201cCan\u2019t go a foot in this town without someone knowing my brother.\u201d</p><p>Clint sits down, and he\u2019s gross and bloody and sweaty from Tony but he doesn\u2019t really care. \u201cWho the fuck\u2019s your brother? Kingpin?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cBilly,\u201d </i>Tommy spits out like a swear. </p><p>Clint blinks, but he\u2019s not dumb, no matter what people think. \u201cWait - I know you. Wanda\u2019s kid. From that thing. With the explosions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplosions every other week in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me for bein\u2019 a bit out of it, I\u2019d just been resurrected from the dead,\u201d Clint says sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re Wanda\u2019s kid. The one that looks like Pietro. You\u2019re the Tommy Kate talks about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Said you were living somewhere doing something. Your brother,\u201d Clint is watching, so he sees the speed of the flinch, \u201cLiving with Billy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured. You gotta be pretty fucking low to go to <i>me</i> for stitches.\u201d</p><p>Tommy plays with the spoon in his hands. \u201cWiccan,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe the Demiurge, I forget. That\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Clint is kind of out of the loop with the gossip, these days, but he thinks he remembers someone telling him about the Demiurge, the kid with the power to end all reality. Maybe it was Loki. That would explain why Clint hadn\u2019t been listening very hard. \u201cYeah, if you want someone to sing his praises you better look somewhere else. I been kind of doing my own thing for a while. Out of touch.\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugs. \u201cHe tries to hug me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHug you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like\u2026\u201d the kid shudders and then there\u2019s the sound of breaking glass and a spoon-shaped hole in the window. \u201cI fucking hate it. Thanks for the cereal and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the broken window,\u201d Clint says, but the kid is gone and so he just tapes newspaper over the hole and goes back to sleep in the bit of the bed his dog used to go to, and he misses Lucky and he misses Kate and he misses Bobbi and he misses a lot of people, really.</p><p>***</p><p>Tommy Shepherd, as it turns out, lives in an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn. Sometimes. Other times, he lives in the attic of a storage barn in Arizona, and sometimes he sneaks into Xavier\u2019s School For Gifted Youngsters so he can eat their cereal. </p><p>\u201cYou need to eat fruit,\u201d Clint says. He\u2019s being responsible. \u201cFruit is needed for bones and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI burn it all off anyway,\u201d Tommy says, and when he stands he stretches and Clint can see how scrawny he is. \u201cSpeedster metabolism, remember? I eat it and it goes away in like twenty minutes so there\u2019s no point being healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong bones and teeth, that\u2019s what was on the commercial.\u201d</p><p>Tommy glowers at him, but he takes the pear and makes great show of eating it in under ten seconds. \u201cHappy now? You\u2019re worse than Billy\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>Clint leans on his chin. \u201cI am, after all, a responsible adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah.\u201d </p><p>Clint really isn\u2019t. Today he woke up at five in the afternoon and only because Tommy was slapping him in the face and yelling, because apparently Clint passed out in a faceful of his own vomit and that\u2019s the sort of thing that will get him killed in a not-glamorous magical way, just in a normal human disaster way. He\u2019s fucked up.</p><p>Tommy doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Clint took the stitches out himself, and there isn\u2019t even a scar, but when he asked Tommy about it Tommy just said scars never last on me in the same sort of way Logan talks about Stryker, and so Clint figures that particular wasp\u2019s nest isn\u2019t worth poking. </p><p>Tommy is nice, though, when he isn\u2019t being an asshole. He comes to Clint when he\u2019s hungry or tired or whatever, and sleeps on his couch for twenty minutes before he leaves again, and it reminds Clint of Kate but not because Kate isn\u2019t this much of a dick. Clint asks Tommy no questions, Tommy tells him no lies. </p><p>\u201cYou could sleep here,\u201d Clint says, when Tommy appears one rainy night soaked through and shaking. \u201cLIke. More often than you do. I think I\u2019m a bad Avenger if I let a kid slum it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my favourite Avenger when I was a kid,\u201d Tommy says, teeth chattering, and he doesn\u2019t complain when Clint flings a blanket around his shoulders. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well don\u2019t sleep rough in a rainstorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you too.\u201d</p><p>Clint leaves Tommy sleeping with a pillow under his head, on the end of the sofa that isn\u2019t covered in empty beer cans and pizza boxes, and when he wakes up the next morning (afternoon) Tommy is still there, still sleeping, his hands curled up next to his face, the blanket so tucked over him that all Clint sees are Iron Man socks and a shock of white fluffy hair. </p><p>***</p><p>Kate comes back, eventually, but Tommy doesn\u2019t leave. </p><p>Clint doesn\u2019t mind. </p>",

The patch of blood is getting bigger quicker than they normally do, and Clint considers himself sort of an expert on patches of blood. \u201cKate told me to come here if I was fucked and I am fucked but she isn\u2019t here so you\u2019re gonna have to do and can you sew you better be able to sew or I\u2019ll be dead and the Scarlet Witch will <i>eat you.\u201d </i></p><p>\u201cI can sew,\u201d Clint says. Ignores that bit about Kate. Thinking about Kate hurts. \u201cWhat do you want me to sew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d says the kid, and strips off his hoodie; underneath is just a lot of skin, and a lot of blood. \u201cSew me up quick before I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die,\u201d Clint says. Bedside manner. What bedside manner? Bobbi used to tell him he\u2019d kill a corpse in a cemetery with the dullness of his voice - he\u2019s terrible at sounding comforting. </p><p>The kid smiles. His skin is pale, but that\u2019s probably blood loss, and his hair is white, although that mostly seems to be a side effect of speedsters, and his face is familiar although Clint doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever met him before. He\u2019s maybe\u2026 seventeen. A little younger than Kate. \u201cI\u2019ll die because I\u2019m a speedster,\u201d he says - in that way Pietro does, talking at a normal speed but with such a drawl that it\u2019s probably slow. \u201cI bleed out faster than snails so can you sew because I\u2019m going to die by tomorrow if you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Life or death. Clint can do life or death. It\u2019s the bits in between he has trouble coping with. \u201cLie on the table,\u201d he says, sweeping all the old breakfast bowls and pizza boxes and newspaper clippings aside, \u201cI\u2019ll get the needle and thread.\u201d </p><p>The kid is called Tommy. Clint doesn\u2019t ask for last names, and Tommy doesn\u2019t tell, although Clint thinks he remembers Wanda saying something about a boy called Tommy, and that explains why the kid invoked the hallowed name. Scarlet Witch. </p><p>She\u2019s already killed Clint once, Clint doesn\u2019t say. </p><p>And the kid has a high threshold for pain, too. Clint remembers getting stitches without anaesthesia, and they hurt like fuck, and although he hadn\u2019t said anything he remembers almost kicking Natasha in the face when she jabbed the needle in too hard. The kid just stuffs the sleeve of his hoodie in his mouth and makes the motion: carry on, and when Clint knows he\u2019s hurting him, pushing too hard or pulling too tight, the kid hardly moves, just twitching at the worst parts. </p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Clint says. His hands are covered in blood and so is his kitchen table, but the kid is refreshingly skin-coloured. \u201cYou can borrow my clothes and I\u2019ll wash your jacket.\u201d</p><p>The kid hands the hoodie over, and Clint tosses a purple one his way.</p><p>And when he looks around the kid is gone again. </p><p>***</p><p>Tony is a bad friend. Clint is a bad friend, too, so it\u2019s okay, and when they\u2019re finished beating each other up Tony says, \u201cThe littler Hawkeye is doing pretty good on her own, man,\u201d Clint nods and smiles and kicks a crumpled beer can on his way back to the flat. </p><p>Tommy is perched on his table, eating cereal. Wearing the Hawkeye hoodie. Clint thinks Tony might have bought it for him, because Tony thinks people wearing their own merchandise is a funny quirk as opposed to something hopelessly narcissistic, and Clint is too lazy to throw it out. \u201cThanks for last time,\u201d says Tommy, when the cereal is done and the bowl is washed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my brother I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know your brother, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows my brother.\u201d Tommy\u2019s face looks ugly for a second. \u201cCan\u2019t go a foot in this town without someone knowing my brother.\u201d</p><p>Clint sits down, and he\u2019s gross and bloody and sweaty from Tony but he doesn\u2019t really care. \u201cWho the fuck\u2019s your brother? Kingpin?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cBilly,\u201d </i>Tommy spits out like a swear. </p><p>Clint blinks, but he\u2019s not dumb, no matter what people think. \u201cWait - I know you. Wanda\u2019s kid. From that thing. With the explosions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplosions every other week in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me for bein\u2019 a bit out of it, I\u2019d just been resurrected from the dead,\u201d Clint says sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re Wanda\u2019s kid. The one that looks like Pietro. You\u2019re the Tommy Kate talks about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Said you were living somewhere doing something. Your brother,\u201d Clint is watching, so he sees the speed of the flinch, \u201cLiving with Billy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I figured. You gotta be pretty fucking low to go to <i>me</i> for stitches.\u201d</p><p>Tommy plays with the spoon in his hands. \u201cWiccan,\u201d he says. \u201cOr maybe the Demiurge, I forget. That\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Clint is kind of out of the loop with the gossip, these days, but he thinks he remembers someone telling him about the Demiurge, the kid with the power to end all reality. Maybe it was Loki. That would explain why Clint hadn\u2019t been listening very hard. \u201cYeah, if you want someone to sing his praises you better look somewhere else. I been kind of doing my own thing for a while. Out of touch.\u201d</p><p>Tommy shrugs. \u201cHe tries to hug me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHug you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like\u2026\u201d the kid shudders and then there\u2019s the sound of breaking glass and a spoon-shaped hole in the window. \u201cI fucking hate it. Thanks for the cereal and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the broken window,\u201d Clint says, but the kid is gone and so he just tapes newspaper over the hole and goes back to sleep in the bit of the bed his dog used to go to, and he misses Lucky and he misses Kate and he misses Bobbi and he misses a lot of people, really.</p><p>***</p><p>Tommy Shepherd, as it turns out, lives in an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn. Sometimes. Other times, he lives in the attic of a storage barn in Arizona, and sometimes he sneaks into Xavier\u2019s School For Gifted Youngsters so he can eat their cereal. </p><p>\u201cYou need to eat fruit,\u201d Clint says. He\u2019s being responsible. \u201cFruit is needed for bones and shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI burn it all off anyway,\u201d Tommy says, and when he stands he stretches and Clint can see how scrawny he is. \u201cSpeedster metabolism, remember? I eat it and it goes away in like twenty minutes so there\u2019s no point being healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong bones and teeth, that\u2019s what was on the commercial.\u201d</p><p>Tommy glowers at him, but he takes the pear and makes great show of eating it in under ten seconds. \u201cHappy now? You\u2019re worse than Billy\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>Clint leans on his chin. \u201cI am, after all, a responsible adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah.\u201d </p><p>Clint really isn\u2019t. Today he woke up at five in the afternoon and only because Tommy was slapping him in the face and yelling, because apparently Clint passed out in a faceful of his own vomit and that\u2019s the sort of thing that will get him killed in a not-glamorous magical way, just in a normal human disaster way. He\u2019s fucked up.</p><p>Tommy doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Clint took the stitches out himself, and there isn\u2019t even a scar, but when he asked Tommy about it Tommy just said scars never last on me in the same sort of way Logan talks about Stryker, and so Clint figures that particular wasp\u2019s nest isn\u2019t worth poking. </p><p>Tommy is nice, though, when he isn\u2019t being an asshole. He comes to Clint when he\u2019s hungry or tired or whatever, and sleeps on his couch for twenty minutes before he leaves again, and it reminds Clint of Kate but not because Kate isn\u2019t this much of a dick. Clint asks Tommy no questions, Tommy tells him no lies. </p><p>\u201cYou could sleep here,\u201d Clint says, when Tommy appears one rainy night soaked through and shaking. \u201cLIke. More often than you do. I think I\u2019m a bad Avenger if I let a kid slum it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my favourite Avenger when I was a kid,\u201d Tommy says, teeth chattering, and he doesn\u2019t complain when Clint flings a blanket around his shoulders. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well don\u2019t sleep rough in a rainstorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you too.\u201d</p><p>Clint leaves Tommy sleeping with a pillow under his head, on the end of the sofa that isn\u2019t covered in empty beer cans and pizza boxes, and when he wakes up the next morning (afternoon) Tommy is still there, still sleeping, his hands curled up next to his face, the blanket so tucked over him that all Clint sees are Iron Man socks and a shock of white fluffy hair. </p><p>***</p><p>Kate comes back, eventually, but Tommy doesn\u2019t leave. </p><p>Clint doesn\u2019t mind. </p>",

There are days he wishes Wanda had done it for real, and left him dead, and there are days he wishes Bobbi had just killed him in his bed, and there are days he wishes Kate would come home and tell him she loves him and that it\u2019s all okay. </p><p>He wishes Kate hadn\u2019t taken Lucky. He would be able to survive without her just fine - she\u2019s hardly the first young attractive woman to see the greener grass - but that\u2019s his <i>dog.</i> His goddamn dog. He paid good money - okay, no, he threatened good people to save Lucky\u2019s life. </p><p>He groans and flings his forearm over his eyes. None of his friends are good enough people to be<i> worried </i>about him, but Tony keeps texting asking if he wants to spar, which means Tony wants to beat him up so Hawkeye starts appearing on the streets again. </p><p>Clint is tired. </p><hr><p>And when he finally makes it out of bed - at two in the afternoon, which is perfectly acceptable thank-you-very-much - there\u2019s a kid in a green hoodie, covered in blood, eating Lucky Charms at <i>his </i>kitchen table and playing with <i>his </i>trickshot arrows, reading <i>his </i>mission reports about the Russians. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cereal,\u201d Clint says.

Clint asks Tommy no questions, Tommy tells him no lies. </p><p>\u201cYou could sleep here,\u201d Clint says, when Tommy appears one rainy night soaked through and shaking. \u201cLIke. More often than you do. I think I\u2019m a bad Avenger if I let a kid slum it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were my favourite Avenger when I was a kid,\u201d Tommy says, teeth chattering, and he doesn\u2019t complain when Clint flings a blanket around his shoulders. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well don\u2019t sleep rough in a rainstorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you too.\u201d</p><p>Clint leaves Tommy sleeping with a pillow under his head, on the end of the sofa that isn\u2019t covered in empty beer cans and pizza boxes, and when he wakes up the next morning (afternoon) Tommy is still there, still sleeping, his hands curled up next to his face, the blanket so tucked over him that all Clint sees are Iron Man socks and a shock of white fluffy hair. </p><p>***</p><p>Kate comes back, eventually, but Tommy doesn\u2019t leave. </p><p>Clint doesn\u2019t mind. </p>",
                "content": "<p>tommy shepherd n clint barton hang out apparently&nbsp;</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><i>disclaimer: this is set in the fraction &amp; aja hawkeye series, during that bit where kate is off in la being a great gay and flirting (ahem i meant fighting) madame masque. because lets face it, that clint is best clint. and i&rsquo;m annoyed at kate for leaving this depressed asshole on his own to, presumably, die or get killed by russians. why did she take his dog, man, dude, you don&rsquo;t take the dog away from the manic depressive, you just don&rsquo;t. also i butchered 616 canon a bit bc so many people have killed clint barton over the years, seriously </i></p><p><i>if it doesnt make sense its bc im an ass</i></p><p>There are days - some days, bad days, infrequent days but <i>there</i> days - when Clint forgets why he started all this. There are days he wishes Wanda had done it for real, and left him dead, and there are days he wishes Bobbi had just killed him in his bed, and there are days he wishes Kate would come home and tell him she loves him and that it&rsquo;s all okay. </p><p>He wishes Kate hadn&rsquo;t taken Lucky. He would be able to survive without her just fine - she&rsquo;s hardly the first young attractive woman to see the greener grass - but that&rsquo;s his <i>dog.</i> His goddamn dog. He paid good money - okay, no, he threatened good people to save Lucky&rsquo;s life. </p><p>He groans and flings his forearm over his eyes. None of his friends are good enough people to be<i> worried </i>about him, but Tony keeps texting asking if he wants to spar, which means Tony wants to beat him up so Hawkeye starts appearing on the streets again. </p><p>Clint is tired. </p><hr /><p>And when he finally makes it out of bed - at two in the afternoon, which is perfectly acceptable thank-you-very-much - there&rsquo;s a kid in a green hoodie, covered in blood, eating Lucky Charms at <i>his </i>kitchen table and playing with <i>his </i>trickshot arrows, reading <i>his </i>mission reports about the Russians. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my cereal,&rdquo; Clint says. In his line of work, he&rsquo;s becoming desensitised to kids covered in blood. Probably not good.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give it back but I don&rsquo;t want to barf,&rdquo; the kid says. He finishes the bowl faster than Clint can blink, and leaves nothing left, not even a puddle of milk. With a rattle, the bowl appears beside the dishes, and the kid is a little out of breath. </p><p>Fucking <i>speedsters. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Who are you? Like, not to be rude, or whatever, but doesn&rsquo;t Xavier usually house muties with injuries?&rdquo; Clint wants to do something with his hands but the kid washed the bowl and the place is too much of a mess for him to even consider tidying up, so he just grabs an arrow from the floor and starts pushing the tip against his thumb until it hurts. </p><p>&ldquo;Me and Xavier aren&rsquo;t on speaking terms,&rdquo; the kid says. The patch of blood is getting bigger quicker than they normally do, and Clint considers himself sort of an expert on patches of blood. &ldquo;Kate told me to come here if I was fucked and I am fucked but she isn&rsquo;t here so you&rsquo;re gonna have to do and can you sew you better be able to sew or I&rsquo;ll be dead and the Scarlet Witch will <i>eat you.&rdquo; </i></p><p>&ldquo;I can sew,&rdquo; Clint says. Ignores that bit about Kate. Thinking about Kate hurts. &ldquo;What do you want me to sew?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; says the kid, and strips off his hoodie; underneath is just a lot of skin, and a lot of blood. &ldquo;Sew me up quick before I die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; Clint says. Bedside manner. What bedside manner? Bobbi used to tell him he&rsquo;d kill a corpse in a cemetery with the dullness of his voice - he&rsquo;s terrible at sounding comforting. </p><p>The kid smiles. His skin is pale, but that&rsquo;s probably blood loss, and his hair is white, although that mostly seems to be a side effect of speedsters, and his face is familiar although Clint doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever met him before. He&rsquo;s maybe&hellip; seventeen. A little younger than Kate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die because I&rsquo;m a speedster,&rdquo; he says - in that way Pietro does, talking at a normal speed but with such a drawl that it&rsquo;s probably slow. &ldquo;I bleed out faster than snails so can you sew because I&rsquo;m going to die by tomorrow if you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>Life or death. Clint can do life or death. It&rsquo;s the bits in between he has trouble coping with. &ldquo;Lie on the table,&rdquo; he says, sweeping all the old breakfast bowls and pizza boxes and newspaper clippings aside, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the needle and thread.&rdquo; </p><p>The kid is called Tommy. Clint doesn&rsquo;t ask for last names, and Tommy doesn&rsquo;t tell, although Clint thinks he remembers Wanda saying something about a boy called Tommy, and that explains why the kid invoked the hallowed name. Scarlet Witch. </p><p>She&rsquo;s already killed Clint once, Clint doesn&rsquo;t say. </p><p>And the kid has a high threshold for pain, too. Clint remembers getting stitches without anaesthesia, and they hurt like fuck, and although he hadn&rsquo;t said anything he remembers almost kicking Natasha in the face when she jabbed the needle in too hard. The kid just stuffs the sleeve of his hoodie in his mouth and makes the motion: carry on, and when Clint knows he&rsquo;s hurting him, pushing too hard or pulling too tight, the kid hardly moves, just twitching at the worst parts. </p><p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; Clint says. His hands are covered in blood and so is his kitchen table, but the kid is refreshingly skin-coloured. &ldquo;You can borrow my clothes and I&rsquo;ll wash your jacket.&rdquo;</p><p>The kid hands the hoodie over, and Clint tosses a purple one his way.</p><p>And when he looks around the kid is gone again. </p><p>***</p><p>Tony is a bad friend. Clint is a bad friend, too, so it&rsquo;s okay, and when they&rsquo;re finished beating each other up Tony says, &ldquo;The littler Hawkeye is doing pretty good on her own, man,&rdquo; Clint nods and smiles and kicks a crumpled beer can on his way back to the flat. </p><p>Tommy is perched on his table, eating cereal. Wearing the Hawkeye hoodie. Clint thinks Tony might have bought it for him, because Tony thinks people wearing their own merchandise is a funny quirk as opposed to something hopelessly narcissistic, and Clint is too lazy to throw it out. &ldquo;Thanks for last time,&rdquo; says Tommy, when the cereal is done and the bowl is washed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell my brother I was here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know your brother, kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone knows my brother.&rdquo; Tommy&rsquo;s face looks ugly for a second. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go a foot in this town without someone knowing my brother.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint sits down, and he&rsquo;s gross and bloody and sweaty from Tony but he doesn&rsquo;t really care. &ldquo;Who the fuck&rsquo;s your brother? Kingpin?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; </i>Tommy spits out like a swear. </p><p>Clint blinks, but he&rsquo;s not dumb, no matter what people think. &ldquo;Wait - I know you. Wanda&rsquo;s kid. From that thing. With the explosions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Explosions every other week in this town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me for bein&rsquo; a bit out of it, I&rsquo;d just been resurrected from the dead,&rdquo; Clint says sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Wanda&rsquo;s kid. The one that looks like Pietro. You&rsquo;re the Tommy Kate talks about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She does?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Said you were living somewhere doing something. Your brother,&rdquo; Clint is watching, so he sees the speed of the flinch, &ldquo;Living with Billy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I figured. You gotta be pretty fucking low to go to <i>me</i> for stitches.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy plays with the spoon in his hands. &ldquo;Wiccan,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Or maybe the Demiurge, I forget. That&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Clint is kind of out of the loop with the gossip, these days, but he thinks he remembers someone telling him about the Demiurge, the kid with the power to end all reality. Maybe it was Loki. That would explain why Clint hadn&rsquo;t been listening very hard. &ldquo;Yeah, if you want someone to sing his praises you better look somewhere else. I been kind of doing my own thing for a while. Out of touch.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy shrugs. &ldquo;He tries to hug me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hug you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Like&hellip;&rdquo; the kid shudders and then there&rsquo;s the sound of breaking glass and a spoon-shaped hole in the window. &ldquo;I fucking hate it. Thanks for the cereal and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks for the broken window,&rdquo; Clint says, but the kid is gone and so he just tapes newspaper over the hole and goes back to sleep in the bit of the bed his dog used to go to, and he misses Lucky and he misses Kate and he misses Bobbi and he misses a lot of people, really.</p><p>***</p><p>Tommy Shepherd, as it turns out, lives in an abandoned warehouse in Brooklyn. Sometimes. Other times, he lives in the attic of a storage barn in Arizona, and sometimes he sneaks into Xavier&rsquo;s School For Gifted Youngsters so he can eat their cereal. </p><p>&ldquo;You need to eat fruit,&rdquo; Clint says. He&rsquo;s being responsible. &ldquo;Fruit is needed for bones and shit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I burn it all off anyway,&rdquo; Tommy says, and when he stands he stretches and Clint can see how scrawny he is. &ldquo;Speedster metabolism, remember? I eat it and it goes away in like twenty minutes so there&rsquo;s no point being healthy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Strong bones and teeth, that&rsquo;s what was on the commercial.&rdquo;</p><p>Tommy glowers at him, but he takes the pear and makes great show of eating it in under ten seconds. &ldquo;Happy now? You&rsquo;re worse than Billy&rsquo;s dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint leans on his chin. &ldquo;I am, after all, a responsible adult.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hah.&rdquo; </p><p>Clint really isn&rsquo;t. Today he woke up at five in the afternoon and only because Tommy was slapping him in the face and yelling, because apparently Clint passed out in a faceful of his own vomit and that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that will get him killed in a not-glamorous magical way, just in a normal human disaster way. He&rsquo;s fucked up.</p><p>Tommy doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind. Clint took the stitches out himself, and there isn&rsquo;t even a scar, but when he asked Tommy about it Tommy just said scars never last on me in the same sort of way Logan talks about Stryker, and so Clint figures that particular wasp&rsquo;s nest isn&rsquo;t worth poking. </p><p>Tommy is nice, though, when he isn&rsquo;t being an asshole.

Clint asks Tommy no questions, Tommy tells him no lies. </p><p>&ldquo;You could sleep here,&rdquo; Clint says, when Tommy appears one rainy night soaked through and shaking. &ldquo;LIke. More often than you do. I think I&rsquo;m a bad Avenger if I let a kid slum it rough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were my favourite Avenger when I was a kid,&rdquo; Tommy says, teeth chattering, and he doesn&rsquo;t complain when Clint flings a blanket around his shoulders. &ldquo;Fuck, I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, well don&rsquo;t sleep rough in a rainstorm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you too.&rdquo;</p><p>Clint leaves Tommy sleeping with a pillow under his head, on the end of the sofa that isn&rsquo;t covered in empty beer cans and pizza boxes, and when he wakes up the next morning (afternoon) Tommy is still there, still sleeping, his hands curled up next to his face, the blanket so tucked over him that all Clint sees are Iron Man socks and a shock of white fluffy hair. </p><p>***</p><p>Kate comes back, eventually, but Tommy doesn&rsquo;t leave. </p><p>Clint doesn&rsquo;t mind. </p>",
