This made the billionaire genius shocked and left speechless.</p><p>-Steve doesn\u2019t know how to cheer you up but he got to try. You\u2019re always nice to him even when the first time you met. He always laughs at your corny and old jokes. He asked you what was the problem and offered to take you out for ice cream. You just gave him a small smile and lied that you are fine. </p><p>-Bucky and Sam agreed to team up this time because they thought that two heads are better than one. \u00a0Sam told you a lot of jokes while Bucky prepared your favorite comfort foods. You thanked them for their efforts and eat silently. Sam attempted to cheer you up again but Nat warned him.</p><p>-Thor shared his precious pop tarts to you and waited for you to cheer up. Sadly, he failed easily.</p><p>-Bruce was not good at cheering up people. He talked to you privately, he informed you that everyone was worried about you. He made a joke that he will let the other guy come out if you don\u2019t cheer up. You ran out of the lab screaming and crying.</p><p>-Nat asked you who does she need to kill to cheer you up. She looked serious so you ran away from her.</p><p>-Wanda tried to read your mind to find out what was the problem. Since you had the same ability as her, you got mad at her instead.</p><p>-Loki lends you his helmet and reads you bunch of Asgardian books. You ended up falling asleep, he immediately bragged to everyone that he already won. He was surprised to find you grumpier when you woke up.</p><p>-Clint was a father figure to you. He used it to his advantage to find out what was the problem. You ignored him and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>-Pietro asked you where do you want to go but you informed him that you are tired and you had a bad day.</p><p>-Peter went to the living room and he was surprised that all of the Avengers were there. All of them looked like they lost something. He showed a cute white cat to everyone. You snatched the cat from him and told him that it was your missing cat.</p><p>-All of the Avengers looked at you. You explained that you are really having a bad day. It started when you went to a bookstore to buy the book that you always wanted. You went to all the bookstore that you know but they don\u2019t have it. You also tried to find it online but it was sold out. The next one was when your white kitten got lost. Tony warned you that pets are not allowed in the tower that\u2019s why you kept the cat hidden from everyone and never a single word about it. The other thing that ruined your day was when you lost your wallet and all the\u00a0 other misfortunes that you experience today.</p><p>-Peter looked at you and gave you a small hug. He suggested that you should all watch a movie and eat a lot. You immediately smiled at him, you thanked him for finding your cat. Tony allowed you to keep the cat and called a publishing company to get you the book that you always wanted. He finally realized that he can\u2019t really replace your beloved cat and surrender.</p><p>-\u201cSo\u2026 Peter won?\u201d Clint looked at everyone. You and Peter looked at each other wondering what he was talking about.</p><p>-\u201cHe is not here when we agreed to cheer Y/N up, no one won\u201d Loki announced.</p><p>-Later that night, Pietro finally asked you out but the moment got ruined when everyone came in with blankets, pillows, and foods.</p><p>-\u201cMovie time!\u201d Peter announced, \u201cwhat are we going to watch?\u201d</p><p>-\u201cMy secret collection\u201d you stood up and announced, \u201cit is called the Avengers funny moments\u201d.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>A/N: Let me know if you are not receiving notification or you want to be removed from the tag list.

        "body": "<p>The men that pulled them into the alley are huge. We\u2019re talking Captain America size. There was three of them and they were practically besides themselves with giddiness once they got a good look at their prey. You\u2019d think that they won the criminal jackpot.</p><p>Maybe they did. They did just catch Tony Stark without his amour.</p><p>Tony guessed that this was the price he paid for spoiling Peter. The plan had been to go to Tony\u2019s favorite steak house to celebrate the kid making honor roll. But, because Tony was wrapped around his pinky finger, all it took was Peter\u2019s off handed mention of his favorite hole in the wall joint that had Tony changing their plans.</p><p>He\u2019d even given Happy the night off so that they could walk off their greasy hamburgers. And look where that got them; trading punches with over grown thugs in a dirty alley.</p><p>The steak house was on a very well-lit street with no dingy alleys that held criminals in it, just for the record.</p><p>Peter was holding his own pretty well. A little too good, in fact. So good that two of guys decided to team up and focus their efforts on bringing him down. Peter played defense, trying to subdue them both without showing too much of his spider hand.</p><p>Tony only had one plan. It was entitled: Don\u2019t get killed. Sure, it wasn\u2019t his most detailed plan but improvising was what Tony did best.</p><p>He fell back to the boxing pointers that Happy had taught him. He hoped that it would buy him enough brownie points that Hogan wouldn\u2019t kill him himself when this was all over with.</p><p>Tony had to say that he was proud of the jab that sent his assailant stumbling away. Too bad it didn\u2019t last long though. The guy angrily shook it off and came storming back towards Tony. His meaty hands wrapped around Tony\u2019s neck and lifted him up off the ground.</p><p>Any and all of Tony\u2019s training went out the window in a blind panic.</p><p>His hands scrambled and clawed at the thug\u2019s arms. He could fell the skin give way underneath his fingernails and blood trickle down the guy\u2019s arms but it didn\u2019t seem to faze him. A swift kick to the stomach only made him madder.</p><p>The guy\u2019s grip tightened and alarm bells rang in Tony\u2019s head.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Black spots took up most of Tony\u2019s vision as he desperately kept digging his nails into his attacker\u2019s arm. It did nothing but make the hands around him squeeze tighter.</p><p>Hazily, Tony thought about Peter. Barely awake, Tony tried to find him. His eyes darted around the alley until he found the kid.</p><p>He had one thug on the ground and nearly had the other down too. He hadn\u2019t noticed Tony\u2019s situation. That was probably for the best, Tony thought. He didn\u2019t want the kid seeing this.</p><p>He hoped that the kid wouldn\u2019t blame himself for tonight though. Peter had a guilt complex to rival Tony\u2019s.</p><p>Tony\u2019s vision blacked out completely. He felt his hand drop down without his permission. Distantly, he thought he heard an angry shout.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>Than nothing.</p><p>***</p><p>When Tony blinked back to life, his first coherent thought was how great it was that he could breathe again. The next was that there was a solid weight on his chest. After a moment, he gathered his strength and lifted his neck to see what was on top of him.</p><p>It was Peter.</p><p>The kid was kneeled beside him, his forehead pressed against the dip of Tony\u2019s sternum. His breaths came out in hot, tired pants against the fabric of Tony\u2019s shirt. Peter\u2019s whole body shook but Tony couldn\u2019t tell if he was crying.</p><p>The question was answered for him when Peter turned his head just enough to catch Tony\u2019s eyes, with red but dry eyes of his own.</p><p>\u201cPete,\u201d Tony\u2019s croaked out and instantly winced. His voice sounded horrible and pain radiated down his throat. He wondered if there\u2019d be any permeant damage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to talk.\u201d Peter\u2019s instructed, his own voice muffled when he turned his head back into Tony\u2019s chest.</p><p>Tony looked around the alleyway, trying to fill in the blanks of what happened after he blacked out. All three thugs were unconscious and webbed to the brick wall across from them. They were mostly in one piece expect for the one that attacked Tony.</p><p>Spider-Man might not kill people but he\u2019d give them a hell of a beating if you pissed him off enough, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI called the police and Cap.\u201d Peter explained. \u201dHe said that he\u2019d try to beat the police here, but I put my web shooters in my backpack though, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d Tony whispered hoarsely but proudly, disobeying orders but Peter didn\u2019t say anything. He turned his face back into Tony\u2019s shirt with a half grin that faded away too quickly for Tony\u2019s liking.</p><p>After a moment, Peter lifted his head again and gave him a worried frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Peter took out his phone and flipped the front facing camera towards Tony.</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>No wonder it hurt so much to talk.</p><p>Tony\u2019s throat was already littered with a ring of ugly deep purple bruises. It traveled from one side of his neck to the other. Two big violet thumbprints met in the middle, right over his wind pipe.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter grumbled as he put up his phone. \u201cLike I said, don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>Tony nodded obediently and Peter laid his head back down, seemingly satisfied.</p><p>Tremors still ran through the kid and Tony was kind of surprised that the incident had shaken him up so badly. He\u2019d gotten hurt way worse in front of Peter on missions. And yeah, Peter tended to take any injury that Tony got badly, but this one seemed to really get to him.</p><p>Then it hit him like a fright train.</p><p>Peter watched his uncle get killed in an alleyway.</p><p>Tony blew out a sigh, kicking himself for forgetting. No wonder Peter was tore up over seeing Tony get attacked like that.</p><p>Peter tilted his head, questioning, and Tony shook his own head quickly. Silently, he lifted a hand and cupped the back of Peter\u2019s curls then he ran his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair. Tony put everything that he wanted to say but couldn\u2019t into the touch.</p><p>They were okay. Peter had saved him. They would be alright.</p><p>Peter must have gotten the message because his eyes slipped closed again and he leaned into Tony\u2019s touch.
