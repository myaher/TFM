Now what we don\u2019t know is exactly why Tony was bullied. However, we can put two and two together. Maybe he was bullied because his dad was so famous and people tend to be jealous. Maybe he was bullied because he had skipped a lot of grades, and was labeled a nerd. No matter the reason, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to figure out that he was absolutely bullied and pushed around.

So he decides to build something to deal with it so he doesn\u2019t have to bother anyone anymore. So he knows what Harley\u2019s going through, and he\u2019s not gonna let it go.

                "content": "<p>Through a couple pieces of dialogue and some common sense, we can make an educated guess that Tony was bullied heavily at school. In Iron Man 2, Tony spends some time talking with a kid. He asks the kid &ldquo;The kid that bullies you at school. What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; Harley responds with &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know that?&rdquo; Tony obviously recognizes the signs of a kid being bullied. Tony then offers Harley a temporary solution, to keep him from being beat up, and the discussion pretty much ends. Now what we don&rsquo;t know is exactly why Tony was bullied. However, we can put two and two together. Maybe he was bullied because his dad was so famous and people tend to be jealous. Maybe he was bullied because he had skipped a lot of grades, and was labeled a nerd. No matter the reason, it doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of time to figure out that he was absolutely bullied and pushed around.

He was probably enjoying too much the thought that Tony had to stand on his toes and put his chin on Steve&rsquo;s shoulder to peer down at the table and the big brown bags with grocery shopping.</p><p>&ldquo;And why do you think I bought something for you?&rdquo; Steve asked back, turning his face a little bit to look at the other man.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhhh, because you love me very much and can&rsquo;t stop thinking about me?&rdquo; Tony answered with a teasing grin. The answer should be obvious, really.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;Hmmmm. Actually, I do have something for you,&rdquo; Steve nodded, putting his hand into the bag and laying down the items.</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, knew it,&rdquo; Tony said proudly, his smile dropping when Steve waved a piece of broccoli in front of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;It is broccoli season! Guess what is for dinner!&rdquo; Steve announced cheerfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Please have a \u00a0steak in there, please say steak, please say steak\u2026&rdquo; Tony chanted quietly and Steve laughed. He continued to put the items out, showing cauliflower (probably to go with the broccoli), cereal (some organic ones that tasted like cardboard and Tony liked Steve a whole lot less), full-fat milk (Tony liked Steve again), more broccoli\u2026</p><p>&ldquo;Okay! You are clearly testing my patience!&rdquo; Tony called, squeezing himself in front of Steve and digging into the bags on his own, feeling that there had to be something good. Like an expensive piece of cheese. Maybe some tasty cheddar. Or aged parmesan. If he was going to eat broccoli, he needed cheese to it, because put broccoli and cheese on one plate and you had heaven.</p><p>Steve let Tony wriggle between him and the table, reversing their position and wrapping hands around his boyfriend&rsquo;s waist. He didn&rsquo;t need to stand on his toes and put his chin on Tony&rsquo;s shoulder without any problem, waiting until Tony would get to the item Steve bought especially for him.</p><p>Tomato paste. Bag of pasta. Yes! Hello, parmesan. Baby carrots. And&hellip;</p><p>Tony frowned, taking out a packet of jello and looking at it.</p><p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember approving this,&rdquo; he said, looking at the square packet of raspberry jelly. It was a regular yellow box, with a raspberry in the left corner, promising great flavor and no artificial coloring. Just in the bottom right corner was an image of Iron Man, exactly MK 50, with spread out nano booster wings.</p><p>&ldquo;I had to buy it,&rdquo; Steve smiled, pressing his cheek to Tony&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, jello for dessert?&rdquo; Tony joked, turning the box in his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It is nice, I guess? Everything with my suit on is great. Just why raspberry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think it is very fitting for you,&rdquo; Steve shrugged, discreetly repositioning his hands around Tony&rsquo;s waist, holding him in a more snuggly hold.</p><p>&ldquo;You think? Because I think they made it raspberry because my suit is red. Which is a major fail on the marketing team&rsquo;s behalf, because everyone knows that my favorite fruit is bluebe&mdash; EEEP!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony didn&rsquo;t finish. He dropped the jello when Steve pressed lips to his cheek and blew a loud raspberry.</p><p>&ldquo;HIHIHIHI!&rdquo; Tony shrilled, trying to wriggle away, but he was squeezed to Steve who didn&rsquo;t leave him much room to move. &ldquo;NO! STEHEHIHIHIVE!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Awww,&rdquo; Steve cooed, smiling impossibly big and pressing his lips to Tony&rsquo;s cheeks, chin, and jawline, blowing more raspberries. &ldquo;Someone is raspberry ticklish,&rdquo; he said in a low, pleasant murmur.</p><p>&ldquo;No no no! Stahp! Stahahahap!&rdquo; Tony continued to laugh, as more raspberries were blown on his skin, this time on his neck. &ldquo;Nooohihihihi!!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmmmm. You even taste like raspberries. I think that the marketing team did a great job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stahahahap! Nohahahat fair&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I am sorry. I forgot you are too sensitive when it comes to raspberries. Like, raspberries really, really tickle you, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Staahahaahap saying thahat!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saying what? Raspberries or tickle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both! Both!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Both? You want me to do both?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;NO! I said&mdash; PPPPHHIHIHIHI!!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony was lost in laughter. Steve was scribbling fingers against his belly and blowing raspberries into his neck and cheeks, and he could only laugh and try to fall to the floor in an attempt to escape, without any luck. He was trapped. It really was a trap. He could exactly picture Steve spotting the jello in the shop, putting it into the cart with a wicked smile, forming an evil plan in his head and waiting for Tony to fall into his clutches. Damn his curious nature. The raspberry tickle attack would continue, if Tony didn&rsquo;t flail his arm in a desperate move and knock down the bag with groceries, making the contents spill out all over the table. The ruckus made Steve stop, while something else caught Tony&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>Cherry for Spider-man. Lime for Hulk. And&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Tony burst out, pushing himself away from Steve just to press himself back, face to face. He was feeling weak and giddy but had a sudden boost of energy when he saw Steve&rsquo;s startled face. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if you taste like blueberries!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve screeched and almost doubled over when soft lips pressed to his neck and blew a loud raspberry in revenge.

The answer should be obvious, really.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHmmmm. Actually, I do have something for you,\u201d Steve nodded, putting his hand into the bag and laying down the items.</p><p>\u201cHa, knew it,\u201d Tony said proudly, his smile dropping when Steve waved a piece of broccoli in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cIt is broccoli season! Guess what is for dinner!\u201d Steve announced cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cPlease have a \u00a0steak in there, please say steak, please say steak\u2026\u201d Tony chanted quietly and Steve laughed. He continued to put the items out, showing cauliflower (probably to go with the broccoli), cereal (some organic ones that tasted like cardboard and Tony liked Steve a whole lot less), full-fat milk (Tony liked Steve again), more broccoli\u2026</p><p>\u201cOkay! You are clearly testing my patience!\u201d Tony called, squeezing himself in front of Steve and digging into the bags on his own, feeling that there had to be something good. Like an expensive piece of cheese. Maybe some tasty cheddar. Or aged parmesan. If he was going to eat broccoli, he needed cheese to it, because put broccoli and cheese on one plate and you had heaven.</p><p>Steve let Tony wriggle between him and the table, reversing their position and wrapping hands around his boyfriend\u2019s waist. He didn\u2019t need to stand on his toes and put his chin on Tony\u2019s shoulder without any problem, waiting until Tony would get to the item Steve bought especially for him.</p><p>Tomato paste. Bag of pasta. Yes! Hello, parmesan. Baby carrots. And\u2026</p><p>Tony frowned, taking out a packet of jello and looking at it.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t remember approving this,\u201d he said, looking at the square packet of raspberry jelly. It was a regular yellow box, with a raspberry in the left corner, promising great flavor and no artificial coloring. Just in the bottom right corner was an image of Iron Man, exactly MK 50, with spread out nano booster wings.</p><p>\u201cI had to buy it,\u201d Steve smiled, pressing his cheek to Tony\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t you love it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, jello for dessert?\u201d Tony joked, turning the box in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It is nice, I guess? Everything with my suit on is great. Just why raspberry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is very fitting for you,\u201d Steve shrugged, discreetly repositioning his hands around Tony\u2019s waist, holding him in a more snuggly hold.</p><p>\u201cYou think? Because I think they made it raspberry because my suit is red. Which is a major fail on the marketing team\u2019s behalf, because everyone knows that my favorite fruit is bluebe\u2014 EEEP!\u201d</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t finish. He dropped the jello when Steve pressed lips to his cheek and blew a loud raspberry.</p><p>\u201cHIHIHIHI!\u201d Tony shrilled, trying to wriggle away, but he was squeezed to Steve who didn\u2019t leave him much room to move. \u201cNO! STEHEHIHIHIVE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww,\u201d Steve cooed, smiling impossibly big and pressing his lips to Tony\u2019s cheeks, chin, and jawline, blowing more raspberries. \u201cSomeone is raspberry ticklish,\u201d he said in a low, pleasant murmur.</p><p>\u201cNo no no! Stahp! Stahahahap!\u201d Tony continued to laugh, as more raspberries were blown on his skin, this time on his neck. \u201cNooohihihihi!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm. You even taste like raspberries. I think that the marketing team did a great job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStahahahap! Nohahahat fair\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am sorry. I forgot you are too sensitive when it comes to raspberries. Like, raspberries really, really tickle you, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaahahaahap saying thahat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying what? Raspberries or tickle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth! Both!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth? You want me to do both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO! I said\u2014 PPPPHHIHIHIHI!!\u201d</p><p>Tony was lost in laughter. Steve was scribbling fingers against his belly and blowing raspberries into his neck and cheeks, and he could only laugh and try to fall to the floor in an attempt to escape, without any luck. He was trapped. It really was a trap. He could exactly picture Steve spotting the jello in the shop, putting it into the cart with a wicked smile, forming an evil plan in his head and waiting for Tony to fall into his clutches. Damn his curious nature. The raspberry tickle attack would continue, if Tony didn\u2019t flail his arm in a desperate move and knock down the bag with groceries, making the contents spill out all over the table. The ruckus made Steve stop, while something else caught Tony\u2019s attention.</p><p>Cherry for Spider-man. Lime for Hulk. And\u2026</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Tony burst out, pushing himself away from Steve just to press himself back, face to face. He was feeling weak and giddy but had a sudden boost of energy when he saw Steve\u2019s startled face. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you taste like blueberries!\u201d</p><p>Steve screeched and almost doubled over when soft lips pressed to his neck and blew a loud raspberry in revenge. That damned goatee.</p><p>\u201cGet back here, Rogers!\u201d Tony called with a laugh, as Steve zoomed out of the kitchen, Tony immediately following.</p><p>Blueberry for Captain America. Tony changed his mind and decided that the marketing team did a great job after all.</p>",
