        "body": "<blockquote><p><i>What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?</i></p></blockquote><p>I know among Jonrya shippers that this line from Jon VI in <i>ADWD </i>is iconic and further evidence that the good ship Jonrya is sailing strong in <i>ASOIAF</i>\u00a0(as GRRM originally intended). I also know that there\u2019s been some, err, tumblr <i>discourse</i>\u00a0about the use of this line for other ships, and this is <i>not </i>a response to that in anyway; I\u2019ve honestly missed 95% of that particular skirmish.\u00a0</p><p>As I was working on another meta tonight, I ran across a very curious line much later in <i>ADWD</i>\u00a0that parallels Jon VI beautifully, so I thought I would put these two scenes together and discuss how they build upon one another.</p><hr><hr><p>Jon VI is the chapter in which Jon finds out about Ramsay\u2019s marriage to fArya, and it marks an important turning point for Jon for the remainder of the book (and arguably the series itself). The quote that follows occurs after Jon reads Ramsay\u2019s letter and has presumably been reflecting on it all day. We find him talking to Mormont\u2019s raven and listening to Melisandre\u2019s worship from inside his chambers.\u00a0<br/></p><blockquote><p>Jon felt as stiff as a man of sixty years.<i> Dark dreams</i>, he thought, <i>and guilt</i>. His thoughts kept returning to Arya. <i>There is no way I can help her. I put all kin aside when I said my words. If one of my men told me his sister was in peril, I would tell him that was no concern of his.</i> <b>Once a man had said the words his blood was black. </b><i><b>Black as a bastard\u2019s heart.</b> -</i>Jon VI, <i>ADWD</i></p></blockquote><p>This particular line feels important since it\u2019s the first time that Jon thinks about his heart in the chapter. Earlier, his heart stops for a moment when he discovers that Ramsay is to wed fArya, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as I\u2019m trying to get at here. This line shows that Jon is a sworn brother of the NW&ndash;his blood has turned black and black is the color of the NW. <i>However</i>, his heart has remained uncolored by his oath to the NW\u2019s. His heart <i>remains</i>\u00a0black because it\u2019s always been marked dark/bad/base due to his bastardy. I think the blood vs. heart here is worthwhile of our attention because we know that Jon ultimately decides effectively to betray the NW for the sake of his sister; his bastard\u2019s heart proves too much for him to overcome. We\u2019ll also see the phrase\u00a0\u201cbastard\u2019s heart\u201d appear later on, so keep that in mind.</p><!-- more --><p>Just after this mini-scene in his chambers, Jon leaves and eventually runs into Melisandre. At first he mistakes her for Ygritte (and idk what to make of that) and then notices that her hands are uncovered. Jon tells her that her fingers will freeze off, and this iconic exchange follows:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf that is the will of R\u2019hllor. Night\u2019s powers cannot touch one whose heart is bathed in god\u2019s holy fire.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cYou heart does not concern me. Just your hands.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201c<b>The heart is all that matters.</b> Do not despair, Lord Snow. Despair is a weapon of the enemy, whose name may not be spoken. Your sister is not lost to you.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cI have no sister.\u201d The words were knives. <i><b>What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?</b></i> <br/><br/>Melisandre seemed amused. \u201cWhat is her name, this little sister that you do not have?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cArya.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cMy half-sister, truly \u2026\u201d <br/><br/>\u201c\u2026 for you are bastard born. I had not forgotten. I have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\u201d\u00a0\n\n<i>-</i>Jon VI, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</p></blockquote><p>First, I appreciate how Melisandre can see right through Jon\u2019s pitiful attempt at pretending he doesn\u2019t care and doesn\u2019t have a sister. He tries to distance himself from Arya, yet it\u2019s a struggle to even say her name with his voice\u00a0\u201choarse\u201d and his thoughts totally occupied with her all day.\u00a0</p><p>Second, I\u2019d like to linger on the parallel structure of the\u00a0\u201cwhat do you know\u201d lines. As someone who has taught her fair share of composition and public speaking classes, I can assure you that parallel structure plays an important function in writing/speaking. The purpose of parallel structure is to elevate ideas to a higher level of importance and to demonstrate <i>equal</i>\u00a0importance between the two parallel statements. It also functions to make statements clearer and easier to remember. Long story short, Martin is waving a giant red flag to tell the reader that these two things (Jon\u2019s heart and his sister Arya) are incredibly important. Also, because the sentences are worded exactly the same in terms of subject and verb,\u00a0\u201cheart\u201d and\u00a0\u201csister\u201d are interchangeable; you can switch their locations and the meaning of the sentences stay exactly the same. I offer this up as evidence of the claim that Arya is without a doubt Jon\u2019s heart.\u00a0</p><p>Having explained that, the line that comes before it&ndash;\u201cThe heart is all that matters\u201d&ndash;takes on another meaning. <i>Arya </i>is all that matters to Jon, particularly because Arya is the only one who could ever love this bastard brother. Arya knew that being a bastard was not a good thing to be (hence the mention of Arya fearing she was a bastard because she looked just like Jon), but she still loved Jon despite him being <i>insert the long list of beliefs about bastards here. </i>And it\u2019s ultimately his heart makes Jon break from the NW in his final <i>ADWD </i>chapter, both his bastard heart\u2019s traitorous ways (according to Westerosi society, that is) and his incredibly strong love for Arya, who is also his heart.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Jon XIII is Jon\u2019s final chapter in <i>ADWD, </i>and I was surprised when I reread it just how much content is packed into this chapter. There\u2019s also many thematic parallels to Jon VI, which against serves to mark those themes as important in a variety of ways.\u00a0</p><p>In Jon VI, we first hear about the letter from Ramsay. In Jon XIII, we finally get to read the whole thing. A lot of Jonrya fans rightly comment on the importance of\u00a0\u201cI want my bride back\u201d from the letter and how Jon echoes it in his own quest to get Arya back. When he echoes Ramsay\u2019s sentiments (hello, parallels!), it becomes <i>I (Jon) want my bride (Arya) back (from you, Ramsay), </i>and offers a strong explanation for why Jon throws everything away to save Arya. Well, that coupled with GRRM\u2019s Waterstones Letter, at least.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of the letter, Ramsay writes:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>I want my bride back. I want the false king\u2019s queen. I\nwant his daughter and his red witch. I want his wildling princess.</i></p><p><i>I want\nhis little prince, the wildling babe. And I want my Reek. Send them to me,\nbastard, and I will not trouble <b>you or your black crows</b>. Keep them from me, and\n<b>I will cut out your bastard\u2019s heart and eat it.</b> -\n\nJon XIII, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</i></p></blockquote><p>In these lines, we once again see black + bastard + heart appear together. GRRM emphasizes again that Jon\u2019s allegiance is to the NW, but also that he has a bastard\u2019s heart that marks him as deceitful/traitorous/lustful/etc. I think all of this is to prime the readers for what comes at the end of this chapter.\u00a0</p><p>(Also, as a side note, I\u2019m inclined to read the consuming of Jon\u2019s heart aka Arya very sexually, which makes sense with the whole echoing of <i>I want my bride back. </i>Coincidentally, that echo occurs with a page of his quote).\u00a0</p><p>In the next scene (again, paralleling the shift from the letter right to Melisandre and the heart quote), Jon enters the Shieldhall and announces that he\u2019s going to make plans to save Hardhome. These plans happen to not involve him. When he\u2019s called out, Jon explains:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo. I ride south.\u201d Then Jon read them the letter Ramsay Snow had written. <br/><br/>The Shieldhall went mad. <br/><br/>Every man began to shout at once. They leapt to their feet, shaking fists. <i>So much for the calming power of comfortable benches.</i> Swords were brandished, axes smashed against shields. Jon Snow looked to Tormund. The Giantsbane sounded his horn once more, twice as long and twice as loud as the first time.<br/><br/>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Jon reminded them when some semblance of quiet had returned. \u201cIt is not for us to oppose the Bastard of Bolton, to avenge Stannis Baratheon, to defend his widow and his daughter. <b>This <i>creature</i> who makes cloaks from the skins of women has sworn to cut\u00a0my heart out, and I mean to make him answer for those words</b> \u2026 but I will not ask my brothers to forswear their vows. <br/><br/>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch will make for Hardhome. I ride to Winterfell alone, unless \u2026\u201d Jon paused. \u201c\u2026 is there any man here who will come stand with me?\u201d\u00a0\n\n<i>-</i>Jon XIII, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Again, the letter is read. Then Jon explicitly states that what\u2019s about to happen is not about Stannis and the politics of Westeros. This is a really weak out for Jon, but a nice work around based in a technicality. But, Jon <i>explicitly</i>\u00a0says what it is about: Ramsay swore to cut out his heart. And we know from Jon VI that GRRM invites us to understand Jon\u2019s heart to be the same thing as Arya. Therefore, Jon is riding to Winterfell because Ramsay swore he would keep Arya away from him forever&ndash;forcibly and gruesomely removing her from his life&ndash;and Jon isn\u2019t having <i>any </i>of that.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a radical claim that Jon went to war for Arya. Even non-shippers can see that much, I\u2019d say. But Jon isn\u2019t just riding to save his sister, he\u2019s riding to <i>save a vital, life-giving part of him</i>, Arya. He has never spoken about <i>any </i>of his family in such a way, except for Arya. I\u2019d argue that based on his commitment to throw it all away (the past several years of his life and his honor) for a girl who is his heart (again, a strange comparison for siblings who aren\u2019t Jaime and Cersei), GRRM is still planning on moving forward with his original plan for Jon and Arya. I also think Jon 2.0 is going to make Ramsay pay to a degree we haven\u2019t yet seen.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

I also know that there\u2019s been some, err, tumblr <i>discourse</i>\u00a0about the use of this line for other ships, and this is <i>not </i>a response to that in anyway; I\u2019ve honestly missed 95% of that particular skirmish.\u00a0</p><p>As I was working on another meta tonight, I ran across a very curious line much later in <i>ADWD</i>\u00a0that parallels Jon VI beautifully, so I thought I would put these two scenes together and discuss how they build upon one another.</p><hr><hr><p>Jon VI is the chapter in which Jon finds out about Ramsay\u2019s marriage to fArya, and it marks an important turning point for Jon for the remainder of the book (and arguably the series itself). The quote that follows occurs after Jon reads Ramsay\u2019s letter and has presumably been reflecting on it all day. We find him talking to Mormont\u2019s raven and listening to Melisandre\u2019s worship from inside his chambers.\u00a0<br></p><blockquote><p>Jon felt as stiff as a man of sixty years.<i> Dark dreams</i>, he thought, <i>and guilt</i>. His thoughts kept returning to Arya. <i>There is no way I can help her. I put all kin aside when I said my words.

Earlier, his heart stops for a moment when he discovers that Ramsay is to wed fArya, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as I\u2019m trying to get at here. This line shows that Jon is a sworn brother of the NW\u2013his blood has turned black and black is the color of the NW. <i>However</i>, his heart has remained uncolored by his oath to the NW\u2019s. His heart <i>remains</i>\u00a0black because it\u2019s always been marked dark/bad/base due to his bastardy. I think the blood vs. heart here is worthwhile of our attention because we know that Jon ultimately decides effectively to betray the NW for the sake of his sister; his bastard\u2019s heart proves too much for him to overcome. We\u2019ll also see the phrase\u00a0\u201cbastard\u2019s heart\u201d appear later on, so keep that in mind.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Just after this mini-scene in his chambers, Jon leaves and eventually runs into Melisandre. At first he mistakes her for Ygritte (and idk what to make of that) and then notices that her hands are uncovered. Jon tells her that her fingers will freeze off, and this iconic exchange follows:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf that is the will of R\u2019hllor. Night\u2019s powers cannot touch one whose heart is bathed in god\u2019s holy fire.\u201d <br><br>\u201cYou heart does not concern me. Just your hands.\u201d <br><br>\u201c<b>The heart is all that matters.</b> Do not despair, Lord Snow. Despair is a weapon of the enemy, whose name may not be spoken. Your sister is not lost to you.\u201d <br><br>\u201cI have no sister.\u201d The words were knives. <i><b>What do you know of my heart, priestess? What do you know of my sister?</b></i> <br><br>Melisandre seemed amused. \u201cWhat is her name, this little sister that you do not have?\u201d <br><br>\u201cArya.\u201d His voice was hoarse. \u201cMy half-sister, truly \u2026\u201d <br><br>\u201c\u2026 for you are bastard born. I had not forgotten. I have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. Coming here, to you. A girl in grey on a dying horse, I have seen it plain as day. It has not happened yet, but it will.\u201d\u00a0\n\n<i>-</i>Jon VI, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</p></blockquote><p>First, I appreciate how Melisandre can see right through Jon\u2019s pitiful attempt at pretending he doesn\u2019t care and doesn\u2019t have a sister. He tries to distance himself from Arya, yet it\u2019s a struggle to even say her name with his voice\u00a0\u201choarse\u201d and his thoughts totally occupied with her all day.\u00a0</p><p>Second, I\u2019d like to linger on the parallel structure of the\u00a0\u201cwhat do you know\u201d lines. As someone who has taught her fair share of composition and public speaking classes, I can assure you that parallel structure plays an important function in writing/speaking. The purpose of parallel structure is to elevate ideas to a higher level of importance and to demonstrate <i>equal</i>\u00a0importance between the two parallel statements. It also functions to make statements clearer and easier to remember. Long story short, Martin is waving a giant red flag to tell the reader that these two things (Jon\u2019s heart and his sister Arya) are incredibly important. Also, because the sentences are worded exactly the same in terms of subject and verb,\u00a0\u201cheart\u201d and\u00a0\u201csister\u201d are interchangeable; you can switch their locations and the meaning of the sentences stay exactly the same. I offer this up as evidence of the claim that Arya is without a doubt Jon\u2019s heart.\u00a0</p><p>Having explained that, the line that comes before it\u2013\u201cThe heart is all that matters\u201d\u2013takes on another meaning. <i>Arya </i>is all that matters to Jon, particularly because Arya is the only one who could ever love this bastard brother. Arya knew that being a bastard was not a good thing to be (hence the mention of Arya fearing she was a bastard because she looked just like Jon), but she still loved Jon despite him being <i>insert the long list of beliefs about bastards here. </i>And it\u2019s ultimately his heart makes Jon break from the NW in his final <i>ADWD </i>chapter, both his bastard heart\u2019s traitorous ways (according to Westerosi society, that is) and his incredibly strong love for Arya, who is also his heart.\u00a0</p><hr><p>Jon XIII is Jon\u2019s final chapter in <i>ADWD, </i>and I was surprised when I reread it just how much content is packed into this chapter. There\u2019s also many thematic parallels to Jon VI, which against serves to mark those themes as important in a variety of ways.\u00a0</p><p>In Jon VI, we first hear about the letter from Ramsay. In Jon XIII, we finally get to read the whole thing. A lot of Jonrya fans rightly comment on the importance of\u00a0\u201cI want my bride back\u201d from the letter and how Jon echoes it in his own quest to get Arya back. When he echoes Ramsay\u2019s sentiments (hello, parallels!), it becomes <i>I (Jon) want my bride (Arya) back (from you, Ramsay), </i>and offers a strong explanation for why Jon throws everything away to save Arya. Well, that coupled with GRRM\u2019s Waterstones Letter, at least.\u00a0</p><p>At the end of the letter, Ramsay writes:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p><i>I want my bride back. I want the false king\u2019s queen. I\nwant his daughter and his red witch. I want his wildling princess.</i></p><p><i>I want\nhis little prince, the wildling babe. And I want my Reek. Send them to me,\nbastard, and I will not trouble <b>you or your black crows</b>. Keep them from me, and\n<b>I will cut out your bastard\u2019s heart and eat it.</b> -\n\nJon XIII, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</i></p></blockquote><p>In these lines, we once again see black + bastard + heart appear together. GRRM emphasizes again that Jon\u2019s allegiance is to the NW, but also that he has a bastard\u2019s heart that marks him as deceitful/traitorous/lustful/etc. I think all of this is to prime the readers for what comes at the end of this chapter.\u00a0</p><p>(Also, as a side note, I\u2019m inclined to read the consuming of Jon\u2019s heart aka Arya very sexually, which makes sense with the whole echoing of <i>I want my bride back. </i>Coincidentally, that echo occurs with a page of his quote).\u00a0</p><p>In the next scene (again, paralleling the shift from the letter right to Melisandre and the heart quote), Jon enters the Shieldhall and announces that he\u2019s going to make plans to save Hardhome. These plans happen to not involve him. When he\u2019s called out, Jon explains:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNo. I ride south.\u201d Then Jon read them the letter Ramsay Snow had written. <br><br>The Shieldhall went mad. <br><br>Every man began to shout at once. They leapt to their feet, shaking fists. <i>So much for the calming power of comfortable benches.</i> Swords were brandished, axes smashed against shields. Jon Snow looked to Tormund. The Giantsbane sounded his horn once more, twice as long and twice as loud as the first time.<br><br>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,\u201d Jon reminded them when some semblance of quiet had returned. \u201cIt is not for us to oppose the Bastard of Bolton, to avenge Stannis Baratheon, to defend his widow and his daughter. <b>This <i>creature</i> who makes cloaks from the skins of women has sworn to cut\u00a0my heart out, and I mean to make him answer for those words</b> \u2026 but I will not ask my brothers to forswear their vows. <br><br>\u201cThe Night\u2019s Watch will make for Hardhome. I ride to Winterfell alone, unless \u2026\u201d Jon paused. \u201c\u2026 is there any man here who will come stand with me?\u201d\u00a0\n\n<i>-</i>Jon XIII, <i>ADWD</i>\n\n</p></blockquote><p>Again, the letter is read. Then Jon explicitly states that what\u2019s about to happen is not about Stannis and the politics of Westeros. This is a really weak out for Jon, but a nice work around based in a technicality. But, Jon <i>explicitly</i>\u00a0says what it is about: Ramsay swore to cut out his heart. And we know from Jon VI that GRRM invites us to understand Jon\u2019s heart to be the same thing as Arya. Therefore, Jon is riding to Winterfell because Ramsay swore he would keep Arya away from him forever\u2013forcibly and gruesomely removing her from his life\u2013and Jon isn\u2019t having <i>any </i>of that.\u00a0</p><p>I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a radical claim that Jon went to war for Arya. Even non-shippers can see that much, I\u2019d say. But Jon isn\u2019t just riding to save his sister, he\u2019s riding to <i>save a vital, life-giving part of him</i>, Arya. He has never spoken about <i>any </i>of his family in such a way, except for Arya. I\u2019d argue that based on his commitment to throw it all away (the past several years of his life and his honor) for a girl who is his heart (again, a strange comparison for siblings who aren\u2019t Jaime and Cersei), GRRM is still planning on moving forward with his original plan for Jon and Arya. I also think Jon 2.0 is going to make Ramsay pay to a degree we haven\u2019t yet seen.\u00a0\u00a0</p></p>",
