Nice to see you. Seen a lot of you lately.</em></p>\n<p>Oh no, he didn\u2019t. Except, he did. And he didn\u2019t stop there, either.</p>\n<p><em>Let\u2019s just get it out of the way.

So far, within the first few seconds of this interview,\u00a0Matt Lauer has made sure to establish two facts:</p>\n<p>He has seen her vagina.</p>\n<p>And he wants to know if she\u2019s learned her lesson.</p>\n<p>What perverted ulterior universe are we in right now?</p>\n<p>But don\u2019t worry.

Lots of men. Oh, joy. </p>\n<p>Clearly, <em>ET&rsquo;s</em> Nancy O&rsquo;Dell is more than just slightly detached from current times- On what planet does Taylor Swift <em>walk home</em> from anywhere, let alone from THE GRAMMYS. </p>\n<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;Swift was quick to clarify things for O&rsquo;Dell.</p>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m not going home with any men tonight.

We wonder why.</p>\n<p>First, he wanted to discuss Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s shape in <em>Batman</em>. Then he wanted to discuss her &lsquo;form-fitting&rsquo; costume. Then it was her diet. And then again, he wants to know more about her diet.</p>\n<p>Apparently, Penacoli had only one topic of interest to discuss with Anne; her body.</p>\n<p>Seemingly aware of this disturbing trend in questions, Anne aptly turns the tables&hellip;</p>\n<p><em>Are you trying to lose weight?
