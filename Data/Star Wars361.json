And it could depend on how well Solo does in the box office and reviews. \u00a0</p><p>Overall, it\u2019s a good movie. \u00a0I still wish they would have just told a similar story with completely new characters or pulled characters from the EU instead of recasting iconic characters with new actors, but it is what it is. \u00a0If you like Star Wars, go see it for yourself and see what you think.</p>",

The events of the greater Star Wars Universe are not the focus here, with the story itself being far more self-contained. For me Alden Ehrenreich is a believable Han Solo, bringing the right amount of charisma to the role. However, he is greatly outshined by his on-screen peers, Woody Harrelson,(Tobias Beckett), Emilia Clarke, (Qi\u2019ra) and of course Donald Glover, (Lando). Beckett is a father figure to Han throughout the film, and the two have a believable emotional bond. \u00a0Conversely, the relationship between Han and Chewbacca, (Joonas Suotamo), is lacking with scenes such as the life debt being left out, and the relationship, on the whole, being sidelined for the Han Qi'ra romance. Qi'ra is perhaps the best character as she is incredibly three-dimensional. Qi'ra is a very capable character as shown during third act fight scene with a sword; which is the action high point of the film. The best thing about the writing for Qi\u2019ra\u2019s character is that she is not written as merely \u00a0Han&rsquo;s love interest, but instead as a very cunning character whose allegiance you can never be sure of. \u00a0Furthermore, the end of the film sets up her connections to Darth Maul, which as far as twists go is very welcome and satisfying. \u00a0Overall the shortcomings of the film are as follows, firstly the film relies far too heavily on nostalgia, with the constant use of Han\u2019s dice becoming unbearable towards the end of the film. This is also reflected in the diegetic dialogue where character will say things that equate to, \u201cremember that?\u201d. Moreover, there is also the use of incredibly on the nose foreshadowing to hint at future events, such as when Qi\u2019ra says something to the extent of, \u201cChewie needs you and I have a feeling you will need him to\u201d. Furthermore, and this may the films greatest crime, there is no real villain, sure Paul Bettany\u2019s Vos is menacing when he is on screen, but that equates to two scenes if that, with the film lacking real danger as a result. A final complaint is that Donald Glovers\u2019 Lando is underused, he is the scene stealer of the film and seems to be punished for that fact by being given precious little to do. On the whole Solo is a lot better than I was expecting it to be, I believe that both hardcore fans and more passive viewers can find something to like here. I would recommend you see it.<br/>3.5/5<br/>Reviewed by Luke</p>",
