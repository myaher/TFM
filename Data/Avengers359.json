As you neared your location, three knocks on the door and a\u00a0\u2018Gimme a second!\u2019 was heard from the other side. As you held your breath, he ran to the door, opening it with a full swing. He looked, dead, really. Messy and ruffled hair, red eyes, terribly dark circles and big under-eye bags. You could smell that he wasn\u2019t in his right state and that a wave of depression had hit him. <i>Was it something I did?</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh. Y/N, uh, hello.\u201d he muttered as his eyes averted from yours.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBucky, cut the crap, we need to talk.\u201d you stated through clenched teeth as you pulled him into his room.<br/></p><!-- more --><p>His room was even more messy too. Clothes sprawled all over the floor, blankets turned inside out and crumpled into some indescribable shape. Broken glass in some corner, pages of a diary ripped out of its leather cover. Cigarette butts by the window and dents in the walls in multiple places.</p><p>\u201cUh-\u201d Bucky tried to talk but you cut him right off.<br/></p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m the devil here, I\u2019m gonna do the talking. To put it simply, it\u2019s feeding season. Nat probably already explained it. Anyways, that night, you saw me feeding, I need it to live. I\u2019m sorry if I caused any negative thoughts and terrible ideas that formed in your head, but I need you to let the Avengers know something. Although I\u2019m supposedly a member, I won\u2019t be sticking around often, especially within the next month or two. Don\u2019t expect anything of me, I\u2019ll come and help if it\u2019s a dire situation, but besides that, I\u2019m gone. If you want, I can erase the scene from that night from your memor-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWait you can do that?\u201d Bucky asked in enthusiasm. You knew that he was referring to his Hydra past and his Winter Soldier days.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes Bucky I can. But it could be hard for you because I haven\u2019t been around for quite a bit of your past.\u201d You said with a broken heart. You knew that he didn\u2019t want to be associated with Hydra or Winter Soldier whatsoever, but you couldn\u2019t help but tell him the truth. A part of him shattered, but you promised yourself to show him something beautiful someday.<br/></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay with the memory\u201d you were shocked to say the least.<br/></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about it, but just don\u2019t erase it. I think I wanna keep it.\u201d Bucky stated. You nodded, respecting his choice and reminded him to tell the others of your decision before teleporting away to some place in who knows where. He only blinked rapidly, trying to process what happened in front of him.<br/></p><hr><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what? We hire her and have a whole celebration and after one damn incident she says she won\u2019t be here for the next month or two? How could you let her slip away like that?\u201d Tony asked Bucky as Bucky held his head in his hands.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you serious Tony? You\u2019re telling me I\u2019m to try and stop the devil from doing whatever she wants? The girl told me to deliver a message, so I did. Plus, she did the whole zapping thing.\u201d Bucky explained quietly. From far away, you were listening to their conversation. <i>He actually listened to me. Shocker.</i>\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cAnyways point is, let Y/N do her own thing, let her figure out whatever she has to figure out until she can come back to us.\u201d Steve asked.<br/></p><hr><p><i><b>I remember the beginning. Watching the world form, almost from nothing. Just, into matter. Back then, I was nothing as well. Just a void being, with no proper form or matter, observing things. I had an idea of who, or what I was. The one thing that people throughout thousands, millions of generations would learn to fear and not mess with. The timeless entity that proved to be the worst of the worst. When man was created, I remember being a snake, no motive to cause harm of course, but it just happens. I guess every where I go, chaos follows. Throughout the Aztecs developing\u00a0a following lead me to start dabbling in the art of human like forms. That\u2019s when my classic form was decided. Black horns that could spiral out of my head, fangs sharp to cut through anything, my whole eye turning black with black wings that stretched out of my back. Depending on my feeling they were either fluffy, full, voluptuous\u00a0with many feathers, or bare, bat like, with claws at the end of them.</b></i></p><p><b><i>I never knew who it was, but someone was always there to tell me\u00a0\u201cTrust nobody and you\u2019ll deal with nobody, trust anybody and you\u2019ll have to deal with anybody.\u2019. Maybe it was my mother? Or a parental figure who just so happened to refresh every time the previous one passed away. I recall my first love: Huitzilin, the local farmer boy at an Aztec village. He had seen my demon like form before and didn\u2019t fear me, or at least from what I could tell. Maybe he even found it beautiful, but that\u2019s long gone now. Over the years, growing a crust on my heart was something I had grown accustomed to. No feelings, no love, no friends. I couldn\u2019t deal with it, and I wasn\u2019t planning on doing so any time soon. Then came Will. I was foolish, I didn\u2019t care that he saw me feeding in the back alleyway on some random man, I didn\u2019t care that he stared at me in awe with my natural form. I was so convinced that he understood that I couldn\u2019t be with him forever but obviously that didn\u2019t work. What was I supposed to do? Marry a man who would die in maybe 70 years and live on with that pain in my chest? No can do, when you\u2019re supposedly eternal.</i></b></p><p><b><i>And now, there\u2019s the Avengers. Tony Stark, so egotistical, thinks that he knows what\u2019s best for me. Steve is a good man, all for justice, but I can smell the fear radiating off of him when I\u2019m around. Bruce, he\u2019s different. Of course he\u2019s scared, but a part of him understands how I feel about myself. Sam is terrified and it\u2019s obvious but I could care less about him. Natasha and Wanda, they seem chill, and understandably they\u2019d like me there as another addition to the small amount of girls, but I can\u2019t risk that feeling. It would crush me.</i></b></p><hr><p>The pen clicked as you closed your journal, writing your latest entry. As you sighed, the urge for human flesh only grew stronger. Groaning at yourself, you threw on a leather jacket over your black sweatpants and grey crop top and slipping on some vans you made your way down to the local bar to pick up some random girl. Admittedly, they tasted better than men. Pushing open the door, the familiar scent of intoxication and sex filled your nostrils. Yet, another familiar scent. <i>Bucky\u2019s scent.</i>\u00a0It was only 5 pm, and Nat wasn\u2019t here either. Walking over to him, you grabbed a seat, temporarily hiding your needs.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here at only 5?\u201d You whispered, causing him to jump in his seat, making some whiskey spill over his glass in the process.<br/></p><p>\u201cJesus. I\u2019m just drownin my sorrows as always.\u201d Bucky claimed, but you knew it was a lie. He was heartbroken, it was as obvious as the dark circles under his eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d you asked, not caring about invading his personal space.<br/></p><p>\u201cSally, she was gorgeous. Always saw the light in me, helped me through nightmares and anxiety attacks, always calmed me down and went through everything with me. I saw her sucking some guy off this morning, I threw a fit and ended up here.\u201d Bucky murmured, chugging down the remainder of his drink and signalling the bartender to fill it up again. Your expression softened upon understanding the situation, yet it brightened up after a thought came into your head.</p><p>\u201cI can help, if you want of course.\u201d You stated simply, searching his eyes for an answer. He slowly but surely lifted his head to match your gaze, and for once had hope in his eyes.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou can erase her from my memories? Like, as if I\u2019d never know she existed?\u201d Bucky inquired with a hopeful look in his eyes. You smiled and nodded in response and waited for his answer.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about that yet, I\u2019ll let you know if I ever feel like it. Thanks.\u201d Bucky stated as his head dropped back down to the table. <i>But hey, the offer was still up</i>. You sighed, making your way to the ladies bathroom, picking up some random, intoxicated woman to feed off of, and began the process. Halfway through feeding, your ears picked up on Bucky saying your name.<br/></p><p><i>Yeah she\u2019s here, but I don\u2019t think you should come here Tony. You heard her plan, and you barging in probably won\u2019t help. Just let the woman live her life until she\u2019s ready to come back.</i></p><p><i><b>Are you kidding me! Barnes I know where you are and I\u2019m going there now. You better keep an eye on Xia!</b></i></p><p><i>Uh a bit late for that. Last time I saw she went upstairs to the bathroom I think? But I have no clue where she is.</i></p><p><i><b>THEN FIND HER!</b></i></p><p>You cringed at the thought of Tony coming to the bar, so you finished wiping off the blood from your lips, locking yourself in a stall whilst waiting for your eyes and wings to return to normal.\u00a0</p><p><i>Xia? Xia?</i></p><p>A voice called out. You focused on it, recognising that Bucky was still in his spot by the bar.</p><p><i>I don\u2019t know if you can hear me, but Tony\u2019s coming here. If you want to stay, then stay, but I can\u2019t promise what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019d say watch out.</i></p><p>His voice seemed soft, with concern and worry in his tone. There was caution, and you were surprised he talked like that. The fact that he talked to you, the devil, as if he had known you for a while. You smiled at his sincerity.</p><p><b>Thank you, James.</b></p><p>You felt his eyes open in shock and heart beat increase at the sound of your voice. You giggled and slowly made your way downstairs, your eyes meeting with his. <i>God they\u2019re beautiful. As if the sea were trapped in them</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh you\u2019re still here?\u201d Bucky asked in slight shock. Nodding in response, you both heard Tony text Bucky saying he was only 5 minutes away.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to see Tony if you don\u2019t want to you know.\u201d Bucky warned.<br/></p><p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m ok. I already said that I wouldn\u2019t be going back for 2-3 months, and he didn\u2019t listen. He\u2019s gonna get it now.\u201d You stated nonchalantly.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dBucky questioned.<br/></p><p>\u201cHa, well. It is feeding season, so I stay away from you all for a reason. But if Tony so desperately wants me to stay, he\u2019s gonna have to deal with it. So, I\u2019m just gonna give him an example of what usually happens.\u201d You purred, eyes darkening at the thought of scaring Tony.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re gonna feed on people, at the tower, or even one of us?\u201d Bucky inquired, with fear practically radiating off of him.<br/></p><p>\u201cGood God now, I\u2019ll just have all my meals in Tony\u2019s room, because why not! Plus, I might steal a secretary of his or two.\u201d You chuckled. Bucky quietly laughed at you saying you would eat in Tony\u2019s room, but you could still smell the fear in him.<br/></p><p>\u201cI promise, no harm will be brung to any of the Avengers. I\u2019ll avoid all of you, it\u2019s just Tony. He doesn\u2019t listen, so if he wants me to be there so bad, he\u2019ll have to put up with me.\u201d you claimed. As the roar of a somewhat expensive car was heard in front of the bar, you put on a show!<br/></p><hr><p>\u201cNow, come on Xia. We hold you a ball, you\u2019re part of the Avengers and you run off like that?\u201d Tony asked as he tried to hug you but you swerve out the way, causing him to pull back awkwardly.<br/></p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, which I know I\u2019m not, Bucky gave my message to you. If you want me to be with you all so badly, you\u2019ll have to deal with me. This is your last chance to listen to me, because if you don\u2019t, sure I\u2019ll go back to the tower with you, but you won\u2019t be happy with me.\u201d You claimed, as Tony tilted his head in confusion.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with any of the weirdos at the tower, you won\u2019t be the first.\u201d Tony said with a smug smirk.<br/></p><p>\u201cFine. But don\u2019t complain when the walls are covered with blood.\u201d You whispered, so only he could hear.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Tony asked, shock and worry in his voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cJeez, chill out old man! I won\u2019t harm any of the Avengers, I have nothing against you all. You worry too much.\u201d You laughed as you punched his arm, taking a mental note to tone it down as he clenched his forearm in pain.<br/></p><p>\u201cRight, right. Noted.\u201d Tony mentioned as he directed you and Bucky to walk outside to the car.<br/></p><p>\u201cBut really, prepare to have cleaning ladies deal with lots of blood.\u201d You mentioned with a straight face.<br/></p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"550\" data-orig-height=\"336\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6713e63e4e5f8bf423a3f66e61ca51d5/tumblr_inline_p9dpooaBpQ1ua04w0_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"550\" data-orig-height=\"336\"/></figure><p>(<b><i>A/N THIS WAS HIS FACE AHAHAHAH)</i></b></p>",

Groaning at yourself, you threw on a leather jacket over your black sweatpants and grey crop top and slipping on some vans you made your way down to the local bar to pick up some random girl. Admittedly, they tasted better than men. Pushing open the door, the familiar scent of intoxication and sex filled your nostrils. Yet, another familiar scent. <i>Bucky\u2019s scent.</i>\u00a0It was only 5 pm, and Nat wasn\u2019t here either.

I\u2019m just drownin my sorrows as always.\u201d Bucky claimed, but you knew it was a lie. He was heartbroken, it was as obvious as the dark circles under his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d you asked, not caring about invading his personal space.<br></p><p>\u201cSally, she was gorgeous. Always saw the light in me, helped me through nightmares and anxiety attacks, always calmed me down and went through everything with me. I saw her sucking some guy off this morning, I threw a fit and ended up here.\u201d Bucky murmured, chugging down the remainder of his drink and signalling the bartender to fill it up again. Your expression softened upon understanding the situation, yet it brightened up after a thought came into your head.</p><p>\u201cI can help, if you want of course.\u201d You stated simply, searching his eyes for an answer. He slowly but surely lifted his head to match your gaze, and for once had hope in his eyes.<br></p><p>\u201cYou can erase her from my memories?

Halfway through feeding, your ears picked up on Bucky saying your name.<br></p><p><i>Yeah she\u2019s here, but I don\u2019t think you should come here Tony.

There was caution, and you were surprised he talked like that. The fact that he talked to you, the devil, as if he had known you for a while. You smiled at his sincerity.</p><p><b>Thank you, James.</b></p><p>You felt his eyes open in shock and heart beat increase at the sound of your voice.

I already said that I wouldn\u2019t be going back for 2-3 months, and he didn\u2019t listen. He\u2019s gonna get it now.\u201d You stated nonchalantly.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dBucky questioned.<br></p><p>\u201cHa, well. It is feeding season, so I stay away from you all for a reason. But if Tony so desperately wants me to stay, he\u2019s gonna have to deal with it. So, I\u2019m just gonna give him an example of what usually happens.\u201d You purred, eyes darkening at the thought of scaring Tony.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re gonna feed on people, at the tower, or even one of us?\u201d Bucky inquired, with fear practically radiating off of him.<br></p><p>\u201cGood God now, I\u2019ll just have all my meals in Tony\u2019s room, because why not! Plus, I might steal a secretary of his or two.\u201d You chuckled. Bucky quietly laughed at you saying you would eat in Tony\u2019s room, but you could still smell the fear in him.<br></p><p>\u201cI promise, no harm will be brung to any of the Avengers. I\u2019ll avoid all of you, it\u2019s just Tony. He doesn\u2019t listen, so if he wants me to be there so bad, he\u2019ll have to put up with me.\u201d you claimed. As the roar of a somewhat expensive car was heard in front of the bar, you put on a show!<br></p><hr><p>\u201cNow, come on Xia. We hold you a ball, you\u2019re part of the Avengers and you run off like that?\u201d Tony asked as he tried to hug you but you swerve out the way, causing him to pull back awkwardly.<br></p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, which I know I\u2019m not, Bucky gave my message to you. If you want me to be with you all so badly, you\u2019ll have to deal with me. This is your last chance to listen to me, because if you don\u2019t, sure I\u2019ll go back to the tower with you, but you won\u2019t be happy with me.\u201d You claimed, as Tony tilted his head in confusion.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with any of the weirdos at the tower, you won\u2019t be the first.\u201d Tony said with a smug smirk.<br></p><p>\u201cFine. But don\u2019t complain when the walls are covered with blood.\u201d You whispered, so only he could hear.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Tony asked, shock and worry in his voice.<br></p><p>\u201cJeez, chill out old man! I won\u2019t harm any of the Avengers, I have nothing against you all. You worry too much.\u201d You laughed as you punched his arm, taking a mental note to tone it down as he clenched his forearm in pain.<br></p><p>\u201cRight, right. Noted.\u201d Tony mentioned as he directed you and Bucky to walk outside to the car.<br></p><p>\u201cBut really, prepare to have cleaning ladies deal with lots of blood.\u201d You mentioned with a straight face.<br></p><p><br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"550\" data-orig-height=\"336\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6713e63e4e5f8bf423a3f66e61ca51d5/tumblr_inline_p9dpooaBpQ1ua04w0_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"550\" data-orig-height=\"336\"></figure><p>(<b><i>A/N THIS WAS HIS FACE AHAHAHAH)</i></b></p>",

As you neared your location, three knocks on the door and a\u00a0\u2018Gimme a second!\u2019 was heard from the other side. As you held your breath, he ran to the door, opening it with a full swing. He looked, dead, really. Messy and ruffled hair, red eyes, terribly dark circles and big under-eye bags. You could smell that he wasn\u2019t in his right state and that a wave of depression had hit him. <i>Was it something I did?</i>\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh. Y/N, uh, hello.\u201d he muttered as his eyes averted from yours.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBucky, cut the crap, we need to talk.\u201d you stated through clenched teeth as you pulled him into his room.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>His room was even more messy too. Clothes sprawled all over the floor, blankets turned inside out and crumpled into some indescribable shape. Broken glass in some corner, pages of a diary ripped out of its leather cover. Cigarette butts by the window and dents in the walls in multiple places.</p><p>\u201cUh-\u201d Bucky tried to talk but you cut him right off.<br></p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m the devil here, I\u2019m gonna do the talking. To put it simply, it\u2019s feeding season. Nat probably already explained it. Anyways, that night, you saw me feeding, I need it to live. I\u2019m sorry if I caused any negative thoughts and terrible ideas that formed in your head, but I need you to let the Avengers know something. Although I\u2019m supposedly a member, I won\u2019t be sticking around often, especially within the next month or two. Don\u2019t expect anything of me, I\u2019ll come and help if it\u2019s a dire situation, but besides that, I\u2019m gone. If you want, I can erase the scene from that night from your memor-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWait you can do that?\u201d Bucky asked in enthusiasm. You knew that he was referring to his Hydra past and his Winter Soldier days.<br></p><p>\u201cYes Bucky I can. But it could be hard for you because I haven\u2019t been around for quite a bit of your past.\u201d You said with a broken heart. You knew that he didn\u2019t want to be associated with Hydra or Winter Soldier whatsoever, but you couldn\u2019t help but tell him the truth. A part of him shattered, but you promised yourself to show him something beautiful someday.<br></p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay with the memory\u201d you were shocked to say the least.<br></p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about it, but just don\u2019t erase it. I think I wanna keep it.\u201d Bucky stated. You nodded, respecting his choice and reminded him to tell the others of your decision before teleporting away to some place in who knows where. He only blinked rapidly, trying to process what happened in front of him.<br></p><hr><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what? We hire her and have a whole celebration and after one damn incident she says she won\u2019t be here for the next month or two? How could you let her slip away like that?\u201d Tony asked Bucky as Bucky held his head in his hands.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you serious Tony? You\u2019re telling me I\u2019m to try and stop the devil from doing whatever she wants? The girl told me to deliver a message, so I did. Plus, she did the whole zapping thing.\u201d Bucky explained quietly. From far away, you were listening to their conversation. <i>He actually listened to me. Shocker.</i>\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cAnyways point is, let Y/N do her own thing, let her figure out whatever she has to figure out until she can come back to us.\u201d Steve asked.<br></p><hr><p><i><b>I remember the beginning. Watching the world form, almost from nothing. Just, into matter. Back then, I was nothing as well. Just a void being, with no proper form or matter, observing things. I had an idea of who, or what I was. The one thing that people throughout thousands, millions of generations would learn to fear and not mess with. The timeless entity that proved to be the worst of the worst. When man was created, I remember being a snake, no motive to cause harm of course, but it just happens. I guess every where I go, chaos follows. Throughout the Aztecs developing\u00a0a following lead me to start dabbling in the art of human like forms. That\u2019s when my classic form was decided. Black horns that could spiral out of my head, fangs sharp to cut through anything, my whole eye turning black with black wings that stretched out of my back. Depending on my feeling they were either fluffy, full, voluptuous\u00a0with many feathers, or bare, bat like, with claws at the end of them.</b></i></p><p><b><i>I never knew who it was, but someone was always there to tell me\u00a0\u201cTrust nobody and you\u2019ll deal with nobody, trust anybody and you\u2019ll have to deal with anybody.\u2019. Maybe it was my mother? Or a parental figure who just so happened to refresh every time the previous one passed away. I recall my first love: Huitzilin, the local farmer boy at an Aztec village. He had seen my demon like form before and didn\u2019t fear me, or at least from what I could tell. Maybe he even found it beautiful, but that\u2019s long gone now. Over the years, growing a crust on my heart was something I had grown accustomed to. No feelings, no love, no friends. I couldn\u2019t deal with it, and I wasn\u2019t planning on doing so any time soon. Then came Will. I was foolish, I didn\u2019t care that he saw me feeding in the back alleyway on some random man, I didn\u2019t care that he stared at me in awe with my natural form. I was so convinced that he understood that I couldn\u2019t be with him forever but obviously that didn\u2019t work. What was I supposed to do? Marry a man who would die in maybe 70 years and live on with that pain in my chest? No can do, when you\u2019re supposedly eternal.</i></b></p><p><b><i>And now, there\u2019s the Avengers.

As you neared your location, three knocks on the door and a&nbsp;&lsquo;Gimme a second!&rsquo; was heard from the other side. As you held your breath, he ran to the door, opening it with a full swing. He looked, dead, really. Messy and ruffled hair, red eyes, terribly dark circles and big under-eye bags. You could smell that he wasn&rsquo;t in his right state and that a wave of depression had hit him. <i>Was it something I did?</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. Y/N, uh, hello.&rdquo; he muttered as his eyes averted from yours.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Bucky, cut the crap, we need to talk.&rdquo; you stated through clenched teeth as you pulled him into his room.<br /></p><p>His room was even more messy too. Clothes sprawled all over the floor, blankets turned inside out and crumpled into some indescribable shape. Broken glass in some corner, pages of a diary ripped out of its leather cover. Cigarette butts by the window and dents in the walls in multiple places.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh-&rdquo; Bucky tried to talk but you cut him right off.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m the devil here, I&rsquo;m gonna do the talking. To put it simply, it&rsquo;s feeding season. Nat probably already explained it. Anyways, that night, you saw me feeding, I need it to live. I&rsquo;m sorry if I caused any negative thoughts and terrible ideas that formed in your head, but I need you to let the Avengers know something. Although I&rsquo;m supposedly a member, I won&rsquo;t be sticking around often, especially within the next month or two. Don&rsquo;t expect anything of me, I&rsquo;ll come and help if it&rsquo;s a dire situation, but besides that, I&rsquo;m gone. If you want, I can erase the scene from that night from your memor-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Wait you can do that?&rdquo; Bucky asked in enthusiasm. You knew that he was referring to his Hydra past and his Winter Soldier days.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes Bucky I can. But it could be hard for you because I haven&rsquo;t been around for quite a bit of your past.&rdquo; You said with a broken heart. You knew that he didn&rsquo;t want to be associated with Hydra or Winter Soldier whatsoever, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but tell him the truth. A part of him shattered, but you promised yourself to show him something beautiful someday.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stay with the memory&rdquo; you were shocked to say the least.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about it, but just don&rsquo;t erase it. I think I wanna keep it.&rdquo; Bucky stated. You nodded, respecting his choice and reminded him to tell the others of your decision before teleporting away to some place in who knows where. He only blinked rapidly, trying to process what happened in front of him.<br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s what? We hire her and have a whole celebration and after one damn incident she says she won&rsquo;t be here for the next month or two? How could you let her slip away like that?&rdquo; Tony asked Bucky as Bucky held his head in his hands.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you serious Tony? You&rsquo;re telling me I&rsquo;m to try and stop the devil from doing whatever she wants? The girl told me to deliver a message, so I did. Plus, she did the whole zapping thing.&rdquo; Bucky explained quietly. From far away, you were listening to their conversation. <i>He actually listened to me. Shocker.</i>&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anyways point is, let Y/N do her own thing, let her figure out whatever she has to figure out until she can come back to us.&rdquo; Steve asked.<br /></p><hr /><p><i><b>I remember the beginning. Watching the world form, almost from nothing. Just, into matter. Back then, I was nothing as well. Just a void being, with no proper form or matter, observing things. I had an idea of who, or what I was. The one thing that people throughout thousands, millions of generations would learn to fear and not mess with. The timeless entity that proved to be the worst of the worst. When man was created, I remember being a snake, no motive to cause harm of course, but it just happens. I guess every where I go, chaos follows. Throughout the Aztecs developing&nbsp;a following lead me to start dabbling in the art of human like forms. That&rsquo;s when my classic form was decided. Black horns that could spiral out of my head, fangs sharp to cut through anything, my whole eye turning black with black wings that stretched out of my back. Depending on my feeling they were either fluffy, full, voluptuous&nbsp;with many feathers, or bare, bat like, with claws at the end of them.</b></i></p><p><b><i>I never knew who it was, but someone was always there to tell me&nbsp;&ldquo;Trust nobody and you&rsquo;ll deal with nobody, trust anybody and you&rsquo;ll have to deal with anybody.&rsquo;. Maybe it was my mother? Or a parental figure who just so happened to refresh every time the previous one passed away. I recall my first love: Huitzilin, the local farmer boy at an Aztec village. He had seen my demon like form before and didn&rsquo;t fear me, or at least from what I could tell. Maybe he even found it beautiful, but that&rsquo;s long gone now. Over the years, growing a crust on my heart was something I had grown accustomed to. No feelings, no love, no friends. I couldn&rsquo;t deal with it, and I wasn&rsquo;t planning on doing so any time soon. Then came Will. I was foolish, I didn&rsquo;t care that he saw me feeding in the back alleyway on some random man, I didn&rsquo;t care that he stared at me in awe with my natural form. I was so convinced that he understood that I couldn&rsquo;t be with him forever but obviously that didn&rsquo;t work. What was I supposed to do? Marry a man who would die in maybe 70 years and live on with that pain in my chest? No can do, when you&rsquo;re supposedly eternal.</i></b></p><p><b><i>And now, there&rsquo;s the Avengers. Tony Stark, so egotistical, thinks that he knows what&rsquo;s best for me. Steve is a good man, all for justice, but I can smell the fear radiating off of him when I&rsquo;m around. Bruce, he&rsquo;s different. Of course he&rsquo;s scared, but a part of him understands how I feel about myself. Sam is terrified and it&rsquo;s obvious but I could care less about him. Natasha and Wanda, they seem chill, and understandably they&rsquo;d like me there as another addition to the small amount of girls, but I can&rsquo;t risk that feeling. It would crush me.</i></b></p><hr /><p>The pen clicked as you closed your journal, writing your latest entry. As you sighed, the urge for human flesh only grew stronger. Groaning at yourself, you threw on a leather jacket over your black sweatpants and grey crop top and slipping on some vans you made your way down to the local bar to pick up some random girl. Admittedly, they tasted better than men. Pushing open the door, the familiar scent of intoxication and sex filled your nostrils. Yet, another familiar scent. <i>Bucky&rsquo;s scent.</i>&nbsp;It was only 5 pm, and Nat wasn&rsquo;t here either. Walking over to him, you grabbed a seat, temporarily hiding your needs.</p><p>&ldquo;What brings you here at only 5?&rdquo; You whispered, causing him to jump in his seat, making some whiskey spill over his glass in the process.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jesus. I&rsquo;m just drownin my sorrows as always.&rdquo; Bucky claimed, but you knew it was a lie. He was heartbroken, it was as obvious as the dark circles under his eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; you asked, not caring about invading his personal space.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sally, she was gorgeous. Always saw the light in me, helped me through nightmares and anxiety attacks, always calmed me down and went through everything with me. I saw her sucking some guy off this morning, I threw a fit and ended up here.&rdquo; Bucky murmured, chugging down the remainder of his drink and signalling the bartender to fill it up again. Your expression softened upon understanding the situation, yet it brightened up after a thought came into your head.</p><p>&ldquo;I can help, if you want of course.&rdquo; You stated simply, searching his eyes for an answer. He slowly but surely lifted his head to match your gaze, and for once had hope in his eyes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You can erase her from my memories? Like, as if I&rsquo;d never know she existed?&rdquo; Bucky inquired with a hopeful look in his eyes. You smiled and nodded in response and waited for his answer.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about that yet, I&rsquo;ll let you know if I ever feel like it. Thanks.&rdquo; Bucky stated as his head dropped back down to the table. <i>But hey, the offer was still up</i>. You sighed, making your way to the ladies bathroom, picking up some random, intoxicated woman to feed off of, and began the process. Halfway through feeding, your ears picked up on Bucky saying your name.<br /></p><p><i>Yeah she&rsquo;s here, but I don&rsquo;t think you should come here Tony. You heard her plan, and you barging in probably won&rsquo;t help. Just let the woman live her life until she&rsquo;s ready to come back.</i></p><p><i><b>Are you kidding me! Barnes I know where you are and I&rsquo;m going there now. You better keep an eye on Xia!</b></i></p><p><i>Uh a bit late for that. Last time I saw she went upstairs to the bathroom I think? But I have no clue where she is.</i></p><p><i><b>THEN FIND HER!</b></i></p><p>You cringed at the thought of Tony coming to the bar, so you finished wiping off the blood from your lips, locking yourself in a stall whilst waiting for your eyes and wings to return to normal.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Xia? Xia?</i></p><p>A voice called out. You focused on it, recognising that Bucky was still in his spot by the bar.</p><p><i>I don&rsquo;t know if you can hear me, but Tony&rsquo;s coming here. If you want to stay, then stay, but I can&rsquo;t promise what&rsquo;s going to happen. I&rsquo;d say watch out.</i></p><p>His voice seemed soft, with concern and worry in his tone. There was caution, and you were surprised he talked like that. The fact that he talked to you, the devil, as if he had known you for a while. You smiled at his sincerity.</p><p><b>Thank you, James.</b></p><p>You felt his eyes open in shock and heart beat increase at the sound of your voice. You giggled and slowly made your way downstairs, your eyes meeting with his. <i>God they&rsquo;re beautiful. As if the sea were trapped in them</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re still here?&rdquo; Bucky asked in slight shock. Nodding in response, you both heard Tony text Bucky saying he was only 5 minutes away.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to see Tony if you don&rsquo;t want to you know.&rdquo; Bucky warned.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I&rsquo;m ok. I already said that I wouldn&rsquo;t be going back for 2-3 months, and he didn&rsquo;t listen. He&rsquo;s gonna get it now.&rdquo; You stated nonchalantly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;Bucky questioned.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Ha, well. It is feeding season, so I stay away from you all for a reason. But if Tony so desperately wants me to stay, he&rsquo;s gonna have to deal with it. So, I&rsquo;m just gonna give him an example of what usually happens.&rdquo; You purred, eyes darkening at the thought of scaring Tony.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Are you saying you&rsquo;re gonna feed on people, at the tower, or even one of us?&rdquo; Bucky inquired, with fear practically radiating off of him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Good God now, I&rsquo;ll just have all my meals in Tony&rsquo;s room, because why not! Plus, I might steal a secretary of his or two.&rdquo; You chuckled. Bucky quietly laughed at you saying you would eat in Tony&rsquo;s room, but you could still smell the fear in him.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I promise, no harm will be brung to any of the Avengers. I&rsquo;ll avoid all of you, it&rsquo;s just Tony. He doesn&rsquo;t listen, so if he wants me to be there so bad, he&rsquo;ll have to put up with me.&rdquo; you claimed. As the roar of a somewhat expensive car was heard in front of the bar, you put on a show!<br /></p><hr /><p>&ldquo;Now, come on Xia. We hold you a ball, you&rsquo;re part of the Avengers and you run off like that?&rdquo; Tony asked as he tried to hug you but you swerve out the way, causing him to pull back awkwardly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, which I know I&rsquo;m not, Bucky gave my message to you. If you want me to be with you all so badly, you&rsquo;ll have to deal with me. This is your last chance to listen to me, because if you don&rsquo;t, sure I&rsquo;ll go back to the tower with you, but you won&rsquo;t be happy with me.&rdquo; You claimed, as Tony tilted his head in confusion.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy with any of the weirdos at the tower, you won&rsquo;t be the first.&rdquo; Tony said with a smug smirk.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Fine. But don&rsquo;t complain when the walls are covered with blood.&rdquo; You whispered, so only he could hear.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what?&rdquo; Tony asked, shock and worry in his voice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Jeez, chill out old man! I won&rsquo;t harm any of the Avengers, I have nothing against you all. You worry too much.&rdquo; You laughed as you punched his arm, taking a mental note to tone it down as he clenched his forearm in pain.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Right, right. Noted.&rdquo; Tony mentioned as he directed you and Bucky to walk outside to the car.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;But really, prepare to have cleaning ladies deal with lots of blood.&rdquo; You mentioned with a straight face.<br /></p><p><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6713e63e4e5f8bf423a3f66e61ca51d5/tumblr_inline_p9dpooaBpQ1ua04w0_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(<b><i>A/N THIS WAS HIS FACE AHAHAHAH)</i></b></p>",

He went from being shorter and smaller than everyone else, even smaller than some children. Then he became taller and buffer than most people, while he knows it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, he still knows it makes him different.</p><p><b>B\u2014 Bad Habits (what bad habits do they have?)</b></p><p>When Steve was younger, he had a bad habit of picking his scabs. After the cuts, from being hit in a fight, would heal up, Steve would peel them off. He doesn\u2019t remember when it started. He thinks that maybe it was because he was angry at himself for not fighting back harder so he would inflict more pain on himself as punishment.</p><!-- more --><p><b>C\u2014 Crying (what makes them cry?)</b></p><p>The memories of the friends and family he\u2019s lost in his life. When he thinks of the lives he wasn\u2019t able to save, he breaks a little bit more.</p><p><b>D\u2014 Death (How do they die? With family or alone? How does their partner find out?)</b></p><p>Steve dies in battle. He threw himself in front of a team member to save them. He would go out being what he has always been, a hero. His partner would be in the battle with Steve, fighting alongside him when he dies. They would be forced to watch the love of their life die in front of their eyes.</p><p><b>E\u2014 Embarrassed (what embarrasses them?)</b></p><p>When Steve thinks back to all the times Bucky had to save him, he feels embarrassed. He hated that someone had to save him, to protect him from himself. He wished he could have been stronger, tougher and not have needed to depend on Bucky as much as he did.</p><p><b>F\u2014 Fracture (what was the first bone that broke/fractured and how?)</b></p><p>His wrist was his first broken bone. It happened when he saw a classmate of his being beaten up and he stepped in to defend him. This immediately gained the attention of the attackers who turned their focus on to Steve.</p><p><b>G\u2014 Gullible (who are they most gullible to and why?)</b></p><p>Himself. He listens to the negative voice in his head too often and he believes the horrible things it says. \u201cYou should have tried harder.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough.\u201d \u201cTheir deaths are your fault.\u201d Steve knows that some things are his fault, that there was nothing he could have done, but he still can\u2019t help but believe the voice and then blames himself. \u00a0</p><p><b>H\u2014 Heartbreak (how did they deal with their first heartbreak?)</b></p><p>Steve\u2019s first heartbreak was watching the girl he was falling in love with asking Bucky out on a date. He felt his heart being crushed when he heard their conversation. Steve ignored the pain he felt, he pushed it down and decided to move on. He didn\u2019t think there was anything else he could do.</p><p><b>I\u2014 Insecure (what are their insecurities?)</b></p><p>At times, Steve still sees himself as the short, frail man from Brooklyn who was constantly looked over by everyone. He knows he doesn\u2019t look the way he used to, but sometimes he still sees himself weak.</p><p><b>J\u2014 Jealous (what makes them feel jealous of others?)</b></p><p>Seeing happy families together makes him jealous. He knows he\u2019d never be able to have that. He could never settle down, build a home, have children, and grow old with the love of his life. Steve sometimes wishes that he could retire from being Captain America and have a simple life, but he knows he could never do that.</p><p><b>K\u2014 Knife (how do they feel about hurting others?)</b></p><p>It doesn\u2019t really bother him, people being hurt or getting killed is just a part of life and war. Steve knows it\u2019s necessary, especially on missions when there are evil men with malicious intents that need to be stopped. But he hates it when innocent people get hurt, whether it\u2019s directly because of him or because of someone he was meant to stop.</p><p><b>L\u2014 Love (who was their first love? Was it returned? How did it end?)</b></p><p>Peggy was the first love of his life. The way he felt when she was around him or when he thought of her, was a feeling he\u2019d never felt before, and one he thought he\u2019d never feel again.</p><p><b>M\u2014 Mindfulness (what calms them down when they\u2019re feeling anxious or depressed?)</b></p><p>When Steve is feeling dejected, he\u2019ll go for a long run or workout to exhaust himself. When he pushes himself to the brink of physical exhaustion he finds that it distracts him from his bad thoughts, he becomes too tired to think of anything negative.</p><p><b>N\u2014 Nightmare (do they have them? How often? What\u2019s their reaction, and what are they about?)</b></p><p>Nightmares used to make an appearance every time he closed his eyes, but over time they faded away. Steve will have a nightmare every now and then, especially after a bad mission or if something happened to make him suddenly remember a bad event from the past. When Steve has them, he tries to brush them off and ignore them even though they tend to keep replaying in his mind for the next day or two.</p><p><b>O\u2014 Obsess (what they\u2019re obsessed with that other people judge them for? What\u2019s their \u201cweird\u201d obsession?)</b></p><p>Steve is obsessed with psychology. He likes to know how peoples minds work, why they behave the way they do. He finds it incredibly interesting and he believes it helps him while he\u2019s on missions, having an insight on how the enemy mind might be working. Steve has a collection of psychology books and documentary DVDs in his room.</p><p><b>P\u2014 Pet (how do they react when their first pet dies?)</b></p><p>It shattered his heart. Other than Bucky, his first dog was his best friend. He spent a lot of his time with the dog, he always talked to the dog about his problems and how his day was. When he lost his first pet, he felt lonely.</p><p><b>Q\u2014 Quirks (what\u2019s one of their quirks they consider a flaw that everyone else likes?)</b></p><p>The left side of Steve\u2019s lips pull up into a half smile when he\u2019s listening to someone speak and he\u2019s wholeheartedly enjoying the conversation. Steve thinks it\u2019s odd that he does that, he never realised he did it until someone pointed it out. But everyone else loves that he does it, it lets them know when he\u2019s genuinely liking a conversation and it also brightens up his handsome features.</p><p><b>R\u2014 Repressed (what memories do they repress or they wish they could forget?)</b></p><p>Steve wishes he could forget seeing Bucky fall from the train. The helplessness and feelings of incapability still linger with him. The look on Bucky&rsquo;s face as he fell was burned into Steves mind.</p><p><b>S\u2014 School (were they ever bullied? What made them personally dislike the school system?)</b></p><p>Steve was constantly bullied while he was at school, and out of school too. \u00a0Bullies always took a special notice of Steve because of how different he was. He was small, thin and not usually around too many friends. Bullies saw him as an easy victim.</p><p><b>T\u2014 Television (what show or movie always makes them cry?)</b></p><p>Anything about war, whether it\u2019s the past or present. When he sees movies or anything to do with war, it makes him think of the past, the things he had to do, the people that he lost and it tears him apart inside.</p><p><b>U\u2014 Umbrage (what pisses them off? What offends them?)</b></p><p>When he hears of injustices or anything unfair, he gets pissed off. He hates when people aren\u2019t treated equally, fairly or justly. Steve believes in equality, and he\u2019ll always fight for what\u2019s right.</p><p><b>V\u2014 Venturesome (what risks do they take that they shouldn\u2019t?)</b></p><p>When he\u2019s on missions, Steve will do anything to protect innocent people and make sure the mission is completed successfully, a lot of these things are dangerous and could kill him. Steve realises that he\u2019s taking huge risks but in his mind, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as no uninvolved people get hurt.</p><p><b>W\u2014 Weakness (what is their personal weakness?)</b></p><p>His friends and family. There is nothing he wouldn\u2019t do for them, he would give his own life for them a thousand times. Everyone, especially his enemies, realises this and they\u2019ll try to use it to their advantage.

When he thinks of the lives he wasn\u2019t able to save, he breaks a little bit more.</p><p><b>D\u2014 Death (How do they die? With family or alone? How does their partner find out?)</b></p><p>Steve dies in battle. He threw himself in front of a team member to save them. He would go out being what he has always been, a hero. His partner would be in the battle with Steve, fighting alongside him when he dies. They would be forced to watch the love of their life die in front of their eyes.</p><p><b>E\u2014 Embarrassed (what embarrasses them?)</b></p><p>When Steve thinks back to all the times Bucky had to save him, he feels embarrassed. He hated that someone had to save him, to protect him from himself. He wished he could have been stronger, tougher and not have needed to depend on Bucky as much as he did.</p><p><b>F\u2014 Fracture (what was the first bone that broke/fractured and how?)</b></p><p>His wrist was his first broken bone. It happened when he saw a classmate of his being beaten up and he stepped in to defend him. This immediately gained the attention of the attackers who turned their focus on to Steve.</p><p><b>G\u2014 Gullible (who are they most gullible to and why?)</b></p><p>Himself. He listens to the negative voice in his head too often and he believes the horrible things it says. \u201cYou should have tried harder.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough.\u201d \u201cTheir deaths are your fault.\u201d Steve knows that some things are his fault, that there was nothing he could have done, but he still can\u2019t help but believe the voice and then blames himself. \u00a0</p><p><b>H\u2014 Heartbreak (how did they deal with their first heartbreak?)</b></p><p>Steve\u2019s first heartbreak was watching the girl he was falling in love with asking Bucky out on a date. He felt his heart being crushed when he heard their conversation. Steve ignored the pain he felt, he pushed it down and decided to move on. He didn\u2019t think there was anything else he could do.</p><p><b>I\u2014 Insecure (what are their insecurities?)</b></p><p>At times, Steve still sees himself as the short, frail man from Brooklyn who was constantly looked over by everyone. He knows he doesn\u2019t look the way he used to, but sometimes he still sees himself weak.</p><p><b>J\u2014 Jealous (what makes them feel jealous of others?)</b></p><p>Seeing happy families together makes him jealous. He knows he\u2019d never be able to have that. He could never settle down, build a home, have children, and grow old with the love of his life. Steve sometimes wishes that he could retire from being Captain America and have a simple life, but he knows he could never do that.</p><p><b>K\u2014 Knife (how do they feel about hurting others?)</b></p><p>It doesn\u2019t really bother him, people being hurt or getting killed is just a part of life and war. Steve knows it\u2019s necessary, especially on missions when there are evil men with malicious intents that need to be stopped. But he hates it when innocent people get hurt, whether it\u2019s directly because of him or because of someone he was meant to stop.</p><p><b>L\u2014 Love (who was their first love? Was it returned? How did it end?)</b></p><p>Peggy was the first love of his life. The way he felt when she was around him or when he thought of her, was a feeling he\u2019d never felt before, and one he thought he\u2019d never feel again.</p><p><b>M\u2014 Mindfulness (what calms them down when they\u2019re feeling anxious or depressed?)</b></p><p>When Steve is feeling dejected, he\u2019ll go for a long run or workout to exhaust himself. When he pushes himself to the brink of physical exhaustion he finds that it distracts him from his bad thoughts, he becomes too tired to think of anything negative.</p><p><b>N\u2014 Nightmare (do they have them? How often? What\u2019s their reaction, and what are they about?)</b></p><p>Nightmares used to make an appearance every time he closed his eyes, but over time they faded away. Steve will have a nightmare every now and then, especially after a bad mission or if something happened to make him suddenly remember a bad event from the past. When Steve has them, he tries to brush them off and ignore them even though they tend to keep replaying in his mind for the next day or two.</p><p><b>O\u2014 Obsess (what they\u2019re obsessed with that other people judge them for? What\u2019s their \u201cweird\u201d obsession?)</b></p><p>Steve is obsessed with psychology. He likes to know how peoples minds work, why they behave the way they do. He finds it incredibly interesting and he believes it helps him while he\u2019s on missions, having an insight on how the enemy mind might be working. Steve has a collection of psychology books and documentary DVDs in his room.</p><p><b>P\u2014 Pet (how do they react when their first pet dies?)</b></p><p>It shattered his heart. Other than Bucky, his first dog was his best friend. He spent a lot of his time with the dog, he always talked to the dog about his problems and how his day was. When he lost his first pet, he felt lonely.</p><p><b>Q\u2014 Quirks (what\u2019s one of their quirks they consider a flaw that everyone else likes?)</b></p><p>The left side of Steve\u2019s lips pull up into a half smile when he\u2019s listening to someone speak and he\u2019s wholeheartedly enjoying the conversation. Steve thinks it\u2019s odd that he does that, he never realised he did it until someone pointed it out. But everyone else loves that he does it, it lets them know when he\u2019s genuinely liking a conversation and it also brightens up his handsome features.</p><p><b>R\u2014 Repressed (what memories do they repress or they wish they could forget?)</b></p><p>Steve wishes he could forget seeing Bucky fall from the train. The helplessness and feelings of incapability still linger with him. The look on Bucky\u2019s face as he fell was burned into Steves mind.</p><p><b>S\u2014 School (were they ever bullied? What made them personally dislike the school system?)</b></p><p>Steve was constantly bullied while he was at school, and out of school too. \u00a0Bullies always took a special notice of Steve because of how different he was. He was small, thin and not usually around too many friends. Bullies saw him as an easy victim.</p><p><b>T\u2014 Television (what show or movie always makes them cry?)</b></p><p>Anything about war, whether it\u2019s the past or present. When he sees movies or anything to do with war, it makes him think of the past, the things he had to do, the people that he lost and it tears him apart inside.</p><p><b>U\u2014 Umbrage (what pisses them off? What offends them?)</b></p><p>When he hears of injustices or anything unfair, he gets pissed off. He hates when people aren\u2019t treated equally, fairly or justly. Steve believes in equality, and he\u2019ll always fight for what\u2019s right.</p><p><b>V\u2014 Venturesome (what risks do they take that they shouldn\u2019t?)</b></p><p>When he\u2019s on missions, Steve will do anything to protect innocent people and make sure the mission is completed successfully, a lot of these things are dangerous and could kill him. Steve realises that he\u2019s taking huge risks but in his mind, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as no uninvolved people get hurt.</p><p><b>W\u2014 Weakness (what is their personal weakness?)</b></p><p>His friends and family. There is nothing he wouldn\u2019t do for them, he would give his own life for them a thousand times. Everyone, especially his enemies, realises this and they\u2019ll try to use it to their advantage. Steve surround himself with his friends and family, and he relies on them a lot.

How does their partner find out?)</b></p><p>Steve dies in battle. He threw himself in front of a team member to save them. He would go out being what he has always been, a hero. His partner would be in the battle with Steve, fighting alongside him when he dies. They would be forced to watch the love of their life die in front of their eyes.</p><p><b>E&mdash; Embarrassed (what embarrasses them?)</b></p><p>When Steve thinks back to all the times Bucky had to save him, he feels embarrassed. He hated that someone had to save him, to protect him from himself. He wished he could have been stronger, tougher and not have needed to depend on Bucky as much as he did.</p><p><b>F&mdash; Fracture (what was the first bone that broke/fractured and how?)</b></p><p>His wrist was his first broken bone. It happened when he saw a classmate of his being beaten up and he stepped in to defend him. This immediately gained the attention of the attackers who turned their focus on to Steve.</p><p><b>G&mdash; Gullible (who are they most gullible to and why?)</b></p><p>Himself. He listens to the negative voice in his head too often and he believes the horrible things it says. &ldquo;You should have tried harder.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not good enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;Their deaths are your fault.&rdquo; Steve knows that some things are his fault, that there was nothing he could have done, but he still can&rsquo;t help but believe the voice and then blames himself. &nbsp;</p><p><b>H&mdash; Heartbreak (how did they deal with their first heartbreak?)</b></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s first heartbreak was watching the girl he was falling in love with asking Bucky out on a date. He felt his heart being crushed when he heard their conversation. Steve ignored the pain he felt, he pushed it down and decided to move on. He didn&rsquo;t think there was anything else he could do.</p><p><b>I&mdash; Insecure (what are their insecurities?)</b></p><p>At times, Steve still sees himself as the short, frail man from Brooklyn who was constantly looked over by everyone. He knows he doesn&rsquo;t look the way he used to, but sometimes he still sees himself weak.</p><p><b>J&mdash; Jealous (what makes them feel jealous of others?)</b></p><p>Seeing happy families together makes him jealous. He knows he&rsquo;d never be able to have that. He could never settle down, build a home, have children, and grow old with the love of his life. Steve sometimes wishes that he could retire from being Captain America and have a simple life, but he knows he could never do that.</p><p><b>K&mdash; Knife (how do they feel about hurting others?)</b></p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t really bother him, people being hurt or getting killed is just a part of life and war. Steve knows it&rsquo;s necessary, especially on missions when there are evil men with malicious intents that need to be stopped. But he hates it when innocent people get hurt, whether it&rsquo;s directly because of him or because of someone he was meant to stop.</p><p><b>L&mdash; Love (who was their first love? Was it returned? How did it end?)</b></p><p>Peggy was the first love of his life. The way he felt when she was around him or when he thought of her, was a feeling he&rsquo;d never felt before, and one he thought he&rsquo;d never feel again.</p><p><b>M&mdash; Mindfulness (what calms them down when they&rsquo;re feeling anxious or depressed?)</b></p><p>When Steve is feeling dejected, he&rsquo;ll go for a long run or workout to exhaust himself. When he pushes himself to the brink of physical exhaustion he finds that it distracts him from his bad thoughts, he becomes too tired to think of anything negative.</p><p><b>N&mdash; Nightmare (do they have them? How often? What&rsquo;s their reaction, and what are they about?)</b></p><p>Nightmares used to make an appearance every time he closed his eyes, but over time they faded away. Steve will have a nightmare every now and then, especially after a bad mission or if something happened to make him suddenly remember a bad event from the past. When Steve has them, he tries to brush them off and ignore them even though they tend to keep replaying in his mind for the next day or two.</p><p><b>O&mdash; Obsess (what they&rsquo;re obsessed with that other people judge them for? What&rsquo;s their &ldquo;weird&rdquo; obsession?)</b></p><p>Steve is obsessed with psychology. He likes to know how peoples minds work, why they behave the way they do. He finds it incredibly interesting and he believes it helps him while he&rsquo;s on missions, having an insight on how the enemy mind might be working. Steve has a collection of psychology books and documentary DVDs in his room.</p><p><b>P&mdash; Pet (how do they react when their first pet dies?)</b></p><p>It shattered his heart. Other than Bucky, his first dog was his best friend. He spent a lot of his time with the dog, he always talked to the dog about his problems and how his day was. When he lost his first pet, he felt lonely.</p><p><b>Q&mdash; Quirks (what&rsquo;s one of their quirks they consider a flaw that everyone else likes?)</b></p><p>The left side of Steve&rsquo;s lips pull up into a half smile when he&rsquo;s listening to someone speak and he&rsquo;s wholeheartedly enjoying the conversation. Steve thinks it&rsquo;s odd that he does that, he never realised he did it until someone pointed it out. But everyone else loves that he does it, it lets them know when he&rsquo;s genuinely liking a conversation and it also brightens up his handsome features.</p><p><b>R&mdash; Repressed (what memories do they repress or they wish they could forget?)</b></p><p>Steve wishes he could forget seeing Bucky fall from the train. The helplessness and feelings of incapability still linger with him. The look on Bucky&rsquo;s face as he fell was burned into Steves mind.</p><p><b>S&mdash; School (were they ever bullied? What made them personally dislike the school system?)</b></p><p>Steve was constantly bullied while he was at school, and out of school too. &nbsp;Bullies always took a special notice of Steve because of how different he was. He was small, thin and not usually around too many friends. Bullies saw him as an easy victim.</p><p><b>T&mdash; Television (what show or movie always makes them cry?)</b></p><p>Anything about war, whether it&rsquo;s the past or present. When he sees movies or anything to do with war, it makes him think of the past, the things he had to do, the people that he lost and it tears him apart inside.</p><p><b>U&mdash; Umbrage (what pisses them off? What offends them?)</b></p><p>When he hears of injustices or anything unfair, he gets pissed off. He hates when people aren&rsquo;t treated equally, fairly or justly. Steve believes in equality, and he&rsquo;ll always fight for what&rsquo;s right.</p><p><b>V&mdash; Venturesome (what risks do they take that they shouldn&rsquo;t?)</b></p><p>When he&rsquo;s on missions, Steve will do anything to protect innocent people and make sure the mission is completed successfully, a lot of these things are dangerous and could kill him. Steve realises that he&rsquo;s taking huge risks but in his mind, it doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as no uninvolved people get hurt.</p><p><b>W&mdash; Weakness (what is their personal weakness?)</b></p><p>His friends and family. There is nothing he wouldn&rsquo;t do for them, he would give his own life for them a thousand times. Everyone, especially his enemies, realises this and they&rsquo;ll try to use it to their advantage. Steve surround himself with his friends and family, and he relies on them a lot. Losing them would devastate him.</p><p><b>X&mdash; X-Double-Minus (random sad headcanon)</b></p><p>Steve remembers most of the names of the innocent people that were lost because of him. He has their names jotted down in a small notebook that he carries around with him everywhere. It reminds him to keep trying harder, to keep fighting the good fight. It&rsquo;s also motivation to not let any more names end up in the little notebook.</p><p><b>Y&mdash; Yearn (what is one thing they want that they know they can&rsquo;t have?)</b></p><p>Normalcy. He wants to be able to have a normal life, do ordinary things that other normal people do. Steve knows he would never be able to leave his job, he just doesn&rsquo;t have it in him to give it up. His desire to keep fighting overrules his desire to settle down with someone and have an ordinary, day-to-day life.</p><p><b>Z&mdash; Zoophobia (is there any animal/bug/creature that scares them?)</b></p><p>Steve hates spiders. The eerie little (sometimes not so little) creatures creep him out and always have. He got bit by one when he was younger and ever since he can&rsquo;t stand them, Steve will refuse to even be in the same room as one.</p>",

Then he became taller and buffer than most people, while he knows it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, he still knows it makes him different.</p>\n<p><b>B&mdash; Bad Habits (what bad habits do they have?)</b></p>\n<p>When Steve was younger, he had a bad habit of picking his scabs. After the cuts, from being hit in a fight, would heal up, Steve would peel them off. He doesn&rsquo;t remember when it started. He thinks that maybe it was because he was angry at himself for not fighting back harder so he would inflict more pain on himself as punishment.</p>\n</p>",
