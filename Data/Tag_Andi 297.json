I&rsquo;ll see you in fifteen, love you!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Love you too, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ hung up the phone, stepping out of his house and onto the sidewalk, shivering in the cold.</p><p><b>7:49 am</b>: TJ knocked on Cyrus&rsquo;s front door, and was welcomed into the home by Cyrus&rsquo;s mom.<br /><br />&ldquo;Good morning, Dr. Goodman. Cyrus told me you and your husband have an anniversary coming up?&rdquo; TJ greeted politely.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, we do! Next Thursday, to be precise,&rdquo; Mrs. Goodman responded.<br /><br />&ldquo;Congratulations! I&rsquo;ll have to keep that in mind,&rdquo; TJ smiled warmly.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cyrus will be down in just a few moments, would you like some tea?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, no thank you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get you to take the tea one day, you know,&rdquo; Mrs. Goodman joked.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mom! Please! Stop pestering TJ to take the tea!&rdquo; Cyrus jogged downstairs, smiling at his secrect boyfriend. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, Underdog. You ready to go?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yep! Bye, mom!&rdquo; Cyrus kissed his mom on the cheek.<br /><br />&ldquo;Bye, Cyrus. Have a good day!&rdquo;<br /><br />Cyrus walked out the door, and TJ followed, smiling at Mrs. Goodman as he closed the door behind him.<br /><br /><b>7:54 am</b>: TJ took Cyrus&rsquo;s hand as they walked towards the school.<br /><br />&ldquo;I missed you this weekend,&rdquo; Cyrus said, looking up at TJ. <br /><br />&ldquo;I missed you too, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ smiled, leaning over to kiss Cyrus&rsquo;s forehead.<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re adorable.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know we are.&rdquo;<br /><br /><b>8:17 am</b>: TJ reluctantly dropped Cyrus&rsquo;s hand when they approached the school.<br /><br />&ldquo;I love you, have a good day. I&rsquo;ll see you at lunch?&rdquo; TJ asked.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yep! I can&rsquo;t wait, I love you too,&rdquo; Cyrus quickly kissed him goodbye, and then walked into school.<br /><br /><b>12:03 pm</b>: TJ looked around the lunchroom, before his eyes fell on his boyfriend and his boyfriend&rsquo;s friends.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hey, Underdog!&rdquo; he sat down next to Cyrus. Cyrus immediately moved closer to his boyfriend, effectively earning the raised eyebrows of Buffy and Andi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You two are weird,&rdquo; Buffy whispered, oblivious to the fact that she and Andi were almost exactly mirroring Cyrus and TJ, Andi curled up in her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Andi is basically in your lap!&rdquo; Cyrus defended.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but she&rsquo;s my&hellip; No way!&rdquo; Buffy suddenly connected the dots in her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re- but- WHAT?&rdquo; she looked back and forth between the boys sitting across from them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha! They figured it out! Pay up, Underdog,&rdquo; Cyrus begrudgingly handed his boyfriend a five dollar bill, which TJ accepted triumphantly.</p><p><b>4:09 pm</b>: TJ wandered up to the swings, sitting down next to his boyfriend.<br />&ldquo;Hey, Underdog. I thought you went home!&ldquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I almost did, but I needed to think,&rdquo; Cyrus responded.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, do you want me to go? Because I get it if you want to be alone,&rdquo; TJ started to stand up from his swing, but Cyrus held him my the wrist.</p><p>&ldquo;No! Please, stay! I want you here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; TJ sat back down on his swing. &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just- I think I want to come out to my parents, and tell them about us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh. <i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; TJ exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that okay? I don&rsquo;t have to if you don&rsquo;t want me to,&rdquo; Cyrus said, though he looked sad at the prospect of keeping his secret.</p><p>&ldquo;No! That&rsquo;s not really my thing, Cyrus. I don&rsquo;t get to decide this for you, but if you decide you do want to come out, &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be by your side- figuratively and, if you want, literally- the whole time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d really do that for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything for you.\"&nbsp;</p>",

How was your weekend?&rdquo; Cyrus asked, getting out of bed reluctantly. He rubbed his eyes and padded across the room to his closet.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was okay, I missed you though,&rdquo; TJ pouted into the phone. Cyrus found the shirt he&rsquo;d been looking for and pulled it off the hanger with a a loud cry of victory. &ldquo;What just happened over there?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hm? Oh, I just found the shirt I&rsquo;ve been looking for,&rdquo; Cyrus explained, as if it were the most obvious answer to TJ&rsquo;s question.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, of course. How could I have been so thoughtless?&rdquo; TJ remarked drily. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m on my way now. I&rsquo;ll be there in 15 minutes.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yay! I&rsquo;ll see you in fifteen, love you!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Love you too, Underdog,&rdquo; TJ hung up the phone, stepping out of his house and onto the sidewalk, shivering in the cold.</p>\n</p>",
