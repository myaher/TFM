The\nfingers tightened into a fist, and he heard Aziraphale let out a soft moan.\nCrowley\u2019s whole body thrilled, with fury, and then with\u2026 another emotion.

His cock was hard in his trousers, and he didn\u2019t even know what\nhe wanted, only that when he watched Aziraphale getting blown, he <i>wanted</i>: he wanted to grab Cherry Lips\nand hurt him, throw him out of the way, wanted to get on top of the angel and\ngrind against him, kiss him, <i>bite</i>\nhim, bite, bite, bite\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d\nAziraphale said, and Crowley heard Cherry Lips hum as Aziraphale looked down at\nhim, his fingers now entangled in the young man\u2019s dark locks, gripping at them\ntightly, and Cherry Lips moaned around his cock as if he enjoyed it, as if he\nenjoyed Aziraphale pulling his hair, repositioning his mouth to his pleasure\u2026\nCrowley imagined it.

When he saw\nCrowley, he smiled, and it was the smile that did it. A superior smile, a\nlittle smug quirk of his lips, the chin raising: he smiled at Crowley as if he\u2019d\nwon something, as if he\u2019d taken something Crowley wanted.</p><p>Crowley\nsipped at his wine, and moved directly forward.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d\nAziraphale said, as Crowley dropped heavily into his lap. \u201c<i>Anthony</i>, I didn\u2019t realize you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crowley\nkissed him savagely, licked into the angel\u2019s mouth and tasted nothing but the\nsweetness of his cherry, and Aziraphale let out a dizzy noise, one of his hands\nsettling clumsily on Crowley\u2019s lower back.</p><p>He\nlooked hazy when Crowley pulled back, his eyes defocused, his lips parted. \u201cIs\nthat\u2014 Is that how we\u2019re greeting one another now, my dear?\u201d he asked in a low\nvoice, too out of it to be truly stern.</p><p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>ss<i>,\u201d\n</i>Crowley said. </p><p>\u201cFar\nbe it from me to argue,\u201d Aziraphale said, and opened his mouth to continue, but\nCrowley squeezed his hips with his knees, and he kissed him again, wound his\nfingers in Aziraphale\u2019s wan curls and kissed him until his jaw hurt.</p><p>He\nmade sure Cherry Lips saw.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> And, Crowley often thought, when he was feeling particularly\nbitter, rightly so. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> How little they knew!</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The <i>bastard</i> was a\nflautist, and he had elegant fingers for the purpose, that looked as if they\u2019d\nbeen made of painted porcelain.

It didn&rsquo;t\nseem right, for him to have sex, to have&mdash;</p><p>To\n<i>enjoy</i> it!</p><p>Aziraphale&rsquo;s\nrounded cheeks were flushed bright pink, and his eyes were screwed up tightly\nas he breathed heavily, and Cherry Lips reached up, the bastard, the little <i>bastard</i>, and dragged Aziraphale&rsquo;s hand\ninto his hair.</p><p>Crowley\nwas aroused. </p><p><i>Desperately</i> aroused. His cock was hard in his trousers, and he didn&rsquo;t even know what\nhe wanted, only that when he watched Aziraphale getting blown, he <i>wanted</i>: he wanted to grab Cherry Lips\nand hurt him, throw him out of the way, wanted to get on top of the angel and\ngrind against him, kiss him, <i>bite</i>\nhim, bite, bite, bite&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;\nAziraphale said, and Crowley heard Cherry Lips hum as Aziraphale looked down at\nhim, his fingers now entangled in the young man&rsquo;s dark locks, gripping at them\ntightly, and Cherry Lips moaned around his cock as if he enjoyed it, as if he\nenjoyed Aziraphale pulling his hair, repositioning his mouth to his pleasure&hellip;\nCrowley imagined it. On his knees, in front of the angel, Aziraphale&rsquo;s hand&mdash; &ldquo;Oh,\nmy dear, dear boy, you really mustn&rsquo;t&mdash; <i>oh</i>,\nmy dear, if you do that I really will&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The\nnoise was wonderful.</p><p>A\nsoft noise, as much a sigh as a moan, and Aziraphale&rsquo;s head tipped back as he\nlet it out, as Cherry Lips swallowed him down, and Crowley watched the way he\ndid it, watched the way he leaned back on his heels, gave Aziraphale a\nlong-lashed look from softly brown eyes, and said, &ldquo;Did you like it, <i>Ezra</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Ezra!</p><p><i>Ezra!</i></p><p>Calling\nhim by his <i>forename</i>, the little&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That\nwas&mdash; Lovely,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, a little awkwardly, and Cherry Lips smiled at him,\nmoving to stand as Aziraphale hurriedly tucked away the evidence of his making\nan effort, and then he said, because it was Aziraphale, &ldquo;thank you, dear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngonna get a drink,&rdquo; Cherry Lips purred. &ldquo;Can I get you something?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,\nno, no, I hardly think so, I&rsquo;ve my tipple right here,&rdquo; Aziraphale said,\ngesturing to his sherry, and Cherry Lips turned on his heels. When he saw\nCrowley, he smiled, and it was the smile that did it. A superior smile, a\nlittle smug quirk of his lips, the chin raising: he smiled at Crowley as if he&rsquo;d\nwon something, as if he&rsquo;d taken something Crowley wanted.</p><p>Crowley\nsipped at his wine, and moved directly forward.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;\nAziraphale said, as Crowley dropped heavily into his lap. &ldquo;<i>Anthony</i>, I didn&rsquo;t realize you were&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley\nkissed him savagely, licked into the angel&rsquo;s mouth and tasted nothing but the\nsweetness of his cherry, and Aziraphale let out a dizzy noise, one of his hands\nsettling clumsily on Crowley&rsquo;s lower back.</p><p>He\nlooked hazy when Crowley pulled back, his eyes defocused, his lips parted. &ldquo;Is\nthat&mdash; Is that how we&rsquo;re greeting one another now, my dear?&rdquo; he asked in a low\nvoice, too out of it to be truly stern.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>ss<i>,&rdquo;\n</i>Crowley said. </p><p>&ldquo;Far\nbe it from me to argue,&rdquo; Aziraphale said, and opened his mouth to continue, but\nCrowley squeezed his hips with his knees, and he kissed him again, wound his\nfingers in Aziraphale&rsquo;s wan curls and kissed him until his jaw hurt.</p><p>He\nmade sure Cherry Lips saw.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> And, Crowley often thought, when he was feeling particularly\nbitter, rightly so. </p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> How little they knew!</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The <i>bastard</i> was a\nflautist, and he had elegant fingers for the purpose, that looked as if they&rsquo;d\nbeen made of painted porcelain. Crowley, not ordinarily an especially violent\ndemon, always felt they looked satisfying to break. </p></p>",

It hardly seemed the done thing, to say no.</i></p>\n<p>Crowley\nwalked into the Hyacinth and Vine, up and into the little upstairs room that\nwas even more firm about being&nbsp;<i>members only</i>&nbsp;than the main part of the bar, and it\nwas a little past midnight at night. They&rsquo;d allowed him in, recognising him as&nbsp;<i>Mr Fell&rsquo;s good friend<a href=\"#_ftn2\" title=\"\"><b>[2]</b></a></i>,\nand he hadn&rsquo;t knocked as he&rsquo;d entered the little bar, stepping in and looking\nfor the familiar ring of men, drinking their genteel drinks and chattering\nabout literature or music.</p>\n<p>They\nmostly looked about the age of Aziraphale&rsquo;s vessel, in their fifties, sixties,\nbut one or two of the young ones was occasionally allowed upstairs, if he\nshowed himself to be particularly erudite&hellip;</p>\n<p>Or\nparticularly playful.</p>\n<p>This\nboy was one of them, some slip of a thing scarcely past twenty-five, a graduate\nfrom Cambridge, with thin legs and thin arms and a heart-shaped face, with\ncherry lips and a little waist. Half of Aziraphale&rsquo;s club was in love with him:\nhe mostly seemed interested in Aziraphale himself, although according to the\nangel, he&rsquo;d never made advances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crowley\nhad been taught his name several times, and spitefully forgot it each time he saw\nhim.</p>\n</p>",

Crowley is the perfect gentleman\u2013 \nopening doors, pulling out your chair, insisting upon paying the cheque\u2013\n but underneath it all, he\u2019s still a demon. Underneath it all, you still\n expect, no, hope for certain things.</p><p>The conversation is\n stimulating, the food exquisite, the wine flows, and with every \nquestion of whether you\u2019ve read something new and interesting lately or \nwhether he\u2019s been someplace different with stories to tell, with every \nflirtatious argument on moral relativism, the gleam of his smile and the\n way he strokes your hand puts you further in the mood for what comes \nafter dessert.</p><!-- more --><p>When he looks at you over the rims of his dark \nglasses, the look in his golden eyes makes your heart skip a beat. He \ndoesn\u2019t have to say a word to let you know he wants you just as badly as\n you want him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d He hisses. The sound of it\n thrills you\u2013 the seductive quality of his voice, and more than that, \nthe lack of control. You never dreamed you might be the one to tempt him, but there\u2019s the proof.</p><p>Crowley\n walks you out to his car, your arm looped through his.

If he had been planning for a \nhotel, you\u2019d be there by now. But instead, he keeps on going. He glances\n over to you now and then, perhaps sensing your excitement.

And <strike>oh no oh no you really didn&rsquo;t think this through what does sex feel like?</strike>\n it&rsquo;s incredible. Crowley is a generous lover. He teases, but when you \nsimply cannot take it anymore, he allows you your pleasure, reaching \naround to see to it that you finish <strike>first no wait it&rsquo;s more romantic together</strike>\n with him. He cries out your name and you his, as you spill into his \nhand and probably make a mess of the upholstery, and it&rsquo;s a sign of how \nmuch he really loves you that he doesn&rsquo;t mind it. He only cares about \ncleaning you up, and helping you back into your clothes <strike>there can&rsquo;t be room to do that in the backseat of the Bentley oh no of course he just uses his powers that&rsquo;s fine then</strike> and kissing you, tenderly, gently.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve\n never had an experience like that before.&rdquo; He admits, as the two of you\n catch your breath, sitting to either side of the wet spot on the seat \nbut leaning in towards each other. He caresses your hair, nuzzling at \nyour cheek.</p><p>&ldquo;Never? All your time on earth, have you never had sex before?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just waiting for the right time, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>You kiss him.</p></p>",
