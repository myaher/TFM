        "body": "<h1>Gendrya </h1><p>Just pointing out a few details from season 7 that seem reasonably suspicion for a potential Gendrya. </p><p><br/></p><p>1. The scene with Hotpie. Hotpie says \u201cyou\u2019re pretty\u201d. I just can\u2019t think of another reason to bring up how Arya looks without it being relevant to the story eventually. And we all know that GoT tends to make sneaky remarks to be used later as foreshadow or irony. </p><p>2. The stark difference in Arya\u2019s physical appearance from other season to now (pun haha). With this being said it comes with the fact the Maisie is a 21 year old adult now. The emphasis on this bit of her looking more like a grown woman feels important because it matches point 3. </p><p>3. They made Gendry behave young. This meaning that they made him behave a little more childish in front of the fully grown men like the Hound and beyond the wall squad. Even though Jon is close to his age. (Could argue this is because he has experienced less battle) I see this as the writers trying to close the age gap people disliked between Arya and Gendry. (Which isn\u2019t huge for the characters but 10 years with the actors so I understand this). </p><p><br/></p><p>I know these are simple, and could just be nothing. But especially the \u201cyou\u2019re pretty\u201d comment.

        "body": "<p>Gendry felt the wind as it weaves through his hair and on his cheek. It was summer once more in Winterfell yet the breeze still felt cold. Though not as cold as it was. The dark thoughts lurk around in his mind, but Gendry simply turns his head away focusing on the flowers that were blooming around him instead of thinking about the war. \u00a0Before the war, the idea of laying down on a hill of flowers was unheard of for a boy like Gendry. One because there were no fields to run and play in, in King&rsquo;s Landing. And two, as a poor boy from Flea Bottom Gendry had no time for such freedoms. But now? Now he had all the time in the world, at least for a while.</p><p>With that in mind, Gendry relaxed back onto the ground arms tucked behind his head as he drifted off into an easy sleep. Not long after his eyes fluttered half open as he felt a small weight land on his head. Through the heaviness of sleep and his dark lashes, he could see Arya hovering over him and smiling widely. She looked absolutely stunning he thought as he was able to watch the loose strands of hair that had fallen from her braid sway and move in the wind. Her cheeks were a healthy shade of red no doubt from running to find him. \u00a0Turning his eyes away from her he picked up what she dropped on his head and inspected it. It was a flower crown. \u00a0He felt his own smile widen as he sat up to sit it securely on top of his head. \u00a0Arya flopped down next to him taking in the clouds, for a moment before she herself closed her eyes.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou woke me up just so you could fall asleep?\u201d Gendry asked the sound of sleep still in his voice making it rumble even more than usual.</p><p>\u201cMhmm\u201d Arya replied easily making herself more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI was having a nice dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both could have had a nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I need you to keep an eye out for Jon and Sansa, they both want to have me cooped up all day with political talks and I\u2019m tired. So please Gendy, will you sit there and hide me?\u201d Gendry wanted to both laugh and roll his eyes at her it was obvious to both that he would do it happily still he played along.</p><p>\u201cHm.. but what do I get out of it? Other than being tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a gift already stupid\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it is a very lovely crown. \u00a0But I think that should count as only part of the gift. I think I should get another gift since I really was taken from such a sweet dream.\u201d</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cFine, if I make another crown for you will you shut \u00a0up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor another crown no, I don\u2019t need crowns but maybe for a kiss-\u201d</p><p>Before Gendry could even finish his sentence Arya had already pushed herself up and stretched to give him a quick and chaste kiss on the lips before maneuvering away from his encircling arms and laying herself back down.</p><p>\u201cThere Stupid\u201d she whispered as she closed her eyes again. This time Gendry did laugh as she curled into his body for warmth a smile still tugging on her lips as she drifted off into sleep. They stayed like that for a time Arya sleeping and Gendry watching over her. It had been that way on the kingsroad when he was the only one other than Yoren who had known her secret.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The wind shifted and the flower crown Arya had made tilted forward. Pushing it back to its previous position he watched as all of the flowers around them danced in the winds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Picking the closest flower to him Gendry studies the petal as he would a newly forged sword. Inspecting the color and how soft it was to the touch. It was much too delicate for his hands he thought as he gently turned it over and over enjoying how the dark blue of the petals melt into a vibrant purple. It was so vibrant and beautiful it reminded Gendry of something Arya had once said to him.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThey were the prettiest flowers in the world\u201d Arya had mentioned the beauty of Winterfell&rsquo;s flower to him one day while their group was settling in for the night, before continuing on towards the wall the next day. They had moved away from the rest of the group and were sitting by the side of the river Arya had picked a few flowers nearby as Gendry looked around to make sure no one could hear them. It was one of the first times Arya had opened up about her home after the initial revelation of who she was. Gendry watched curiously as she absentmindedly began to thread the flowers together making a small crown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice how did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat this?\u201d Arya lifted the flowers up. \u201cMy mother taught my sister and me how to make them. Though Sansa\u2019s were always prettier.\u201d Gendry noticed the sadness\u00a0<b></b>edging its way around Arya\u2019s voice as she thought of her family. Not wanting her to focus on it he offered her another option\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you show me how to make one?\u201d Arya was surprised at the request but quickly agreed. Excitedly plucking more flowers and shoving them into Gendry\u2019s hands. For hours they talked and laughed and made crowns together. Gendry\u2019s hands fumbled a few times in the beginning before he got the hang of it. Arya would later begrudgingly admit that Gendry too was better at making them than she was. He simply blushed and grumbled that it was just because he was used to crafting things as a blacksmith. It became a way to pass time on the road, then it became a way to take their minds off of the horrors of Harrenhal, and as a way to relax and be left alone from the brotherhood.\u00a0</p><p>After Arya was gone Gendry still made crowns. This time to give to the children at the inn. At Least that\u2019s what he told himself. The truth was he didn\u2019t want to sever his last tie to Arya. So he continued to make more. Always with the hope that one day he would get to make her another one, one made with Winterfell flowers as an apology for everything that had happened between them.\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>There were no crowns made when winter came and with it the true war. \u00a0They were reunited now but there was no time for such things. Besides, Gendry had learned the truth of his heritage by that point. And Arya of her aunt\u2019s past. Both would agree that the promise of flower crowns had lost its appeal. Especially with the Targaryen queen and Jon learning of their own intricately woven past and destiny. \u00a0Instead of making crowns Arya and Gendry made up for the lost time and the uncertainty of what the future held in other ways. But if he was honest with himself the thought of seeing Arya one day wearing a flower crown again helped Gendry to push through the fear of the white walkers and fight for their future. \u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>The day that the Night King had fallen was the next time he\u2019d made Arya a new crown. \u00a0Gendry would always remember the moment the Night King was killed. It was the same moment when it seemed the sun broke through the night giving him a chance to look and see who amongst them was still alive. Gendry felt his heart race harder than it had during all the fighting as he looked for Arya who\u2019d he lost sight of at some point in the night. Forcing back the bile that he could feel pressing forward he turned to look for her family she had to be with them. That was the only option. \u00a0And thank the gods it was. Relief washed over him as did the exhaustion of the night before as he sunk to the ground the moment he spotted her hugging her brothers and sister. She spotted him easily, though she too looked ready to fall over as she tried to separate from the family hug. Gendry waved her off silently telling her it was alright hey would have time together after, plenty of time. For now, he was content to simply watch over her. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>Later that day however after some sleep Arya found him sitting in the remnants of Winterfell\u2019s forge. They stood apart studying each other neither saying anything before both sets of hands were touching and checking every inch of each other&rsquo;s bodies. Whether to look for the inevitable injuries that occurred over the night or just to reassure themselves that they were there and safe they couldn\u2019t tell. All they knew was that as they held each other this was the first time they felt true peace in a very long time. \u00a0When Gendry had stumbled through asking her to marry him that day Arya couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m dressed like this you stupid bull?\u201d It was at that moment that Gendry took notice of what she was wearing. It was a rather formal dress, much too formal to wear on a day of recovery. \u00a0Her hair had also been braided much more intricately than usual no doubt Sansa\u2019s handy work. Gendry felt the heat rush to his cheeks.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou look nice\u201d a memory from their past makes him smile as he steps closer to her and takes one of the loose strands left purposefully out of the braid and brings it close to him inhaling the warm scent of perfume. \u201cYou smell nice too\u201d \u00a0Arya pretended to humph and spun out of his arms.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWell you don\u2019t, you stink.\u201d \u00a0she stuck her tongue out childishly at him causing them both to laugh. \u00a0Missing the warmth of her body already Gendry pulls her back towards him.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He says confidently, watching her head nod in agreement with him. They stay there for just a moment letting themselves bask in how far they\u2019d come. From simply being a Stupid Bull and M\u2019lady to a man and woman in love. \u00a0Once it was over Arya grabbed one of his large hands in both of hers and began to excitedly pull him in the direction of the godswood. There he found her small family waiting for them bundled together in warm Stark cloaks. Sansa holding two more. \u00a0Arya went to move forward to have the Stark cloak placed on her shoulders, but Gendry gently pulled her back.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d there was confusion etched in her voice.

            "comment": "<p>Gendry felt the wind as it weaves through his hair and on his cheek. It was summer once more in Winterfell yet the breeze still felt cold. Though not as cold as it was. The dark thoughts lurk around in his mind, but Gendry simply turns his head away focusing on the flowers that were blooming around him instead of thinking about the war. \u00a0Before the war, the idea of laying down on a hill of flowers was unheard of for a boy like Gendry. One because there were no fields to run and play in, in King\u2019s Landing. And two, as a poor boy from Flea Bottom Gendry had no time for such freedoms. But now? Now he had all the time in the world, at least for a while.</p><p>With that in mind, Gendry relaxed back onto the ground arms tucked behind his head as he drifted off into an easy sleep. Not long after his eyes fluttered half open as he felt a small weight land on his head. Through the heaviness of sleep and his dark lashes, he could see Arya hovering over him and smiling widely. She looked absolutely stunning he thought as he was able to watch the loose strands of hair that had fallen from her braid sway and move in the wind. Her cheeks were a healthy shade of red no doubt from running to find him. \u00a0Turning his eyes away from her he picked up what she dropped on his head and inspected it. It was a flower crown. \u00a0He felt his own smile widen as he sat up to sit it securely on top of his head. \u00a0Arya flopped down next to him taking in the clouds, for a moment before she herself closed her eyes.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou woke me up just so you could fall asleep?\u201d Gendry asked the sound of sleep still in his voice making it rumble even more than usual.</p><p>\u201cMhmm\u201d Arya replied easily making herself more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI was having a nice dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both could have had a nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I need you to keep an eye out for Jon and Sansa, they both want to have me cooped up all day with political talks and I\u2019m tired. So please Gendy, will you sit there and hide me?\u201d Gendry wanted to both laugh and roll his eyes at her it was obvious to both that he would do it happily still he played along.</p><p>\u201cHm.. but what do I get out of it? Other than being tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a gift already stupid\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it is a very lovely crown. \u00a0But I think that should count as only part of the gift. I think I should get another gift since I really was taken from such a sweet dream.\u201d</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cFine, if I make another crown for you will you shut \u00a0up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor another crown no, I don\u2019t need crowns but maybe for a kiss-\u201d</p><p>Before Gendry could even finish his sentence Arya had already pushed herself up and stretched to give him a quick and chaste kiss on the lips before maneuvering away from his encircling arms and laying herself back down.</p><p>\u201cThere Stupid\u201d she whispered as she closed her eyes again. This time Gendry did laugh as she curled into his body for warmth a smile still tugging on her lips as she drifted off into sleep. They stayed like that for a time Arya sleeping and Gendry watching over her. It had been that way on the kingsroad when he was the only one other than Yoren who had known her secret.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The wind shifted and the flower crown Arya had made tilted forward.

It was a flower crown. \u00a0He felt his own smile widen as he sat up to sit it securely on top of his head. \u00a0Arya flopped down next to him taking in the clouds, for a moment before she herself closed her eyes.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou woke me up just so you could fall asleep?\u201d Gendry asked the sound of sleep still in his voice making it rumble even more than usual.</p><p>\u201cMhmm\u201d Arya replied easily making herself more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI was having a nice dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both could have had a nice one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I need you to keep an eye out for Jon and Sansa, they both want to have me cooped up all day with political talks and I\u2019m tired. So please Gendy, will you sit there and hide me?\u201d Gendry wanted to both laugh and roll his eyes at her it was obvious to both that he would do it happily still he played along.</p><p>\u201cHm.. but what do I get out of it? Other than being tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a gift already stupid\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it is a very lovely crown. \u00a0But I think that should count as only part of the gift. I think I should get another gift since I really was taken from such a sweet dream.\u201d</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cFine, if I make another crown for you will you shut \u00a0up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor another crown no, I don\u2019t need crowns but maybe for a kiss-\u201d</p><p>Before Gendry could even finish his sentence Arya had already pushed herself up and stretched to give him a quick and chaste kiss on the lips before maneuvering away from his encircling arms and laying herself back down.</p><p>\u201cThere Stupid\u201d she whispered as she closed her eyes again. This time Gendry did laugh as she curled into his body for warmth a smile still tugging on her lips as she drifted off into sleep. They stayed like that for a time Arya sleeping and Gendry watching over her. It had been that way on the kingsroad when he was the only one other than Yoren who had known her secret.</p><p><b></b></p><p>The wind shifted and the flower crown Arya had made tilted forward. Pushing it back to its previous position he watched as all of the flowers around them danced in the winds.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0Picking the closest flower to him Gendry studies the petal as he would a newly forged sword. Inspecting the color and how soft it was to the touch. It was much too delicate for his hands he thought as he gently turned it over and over enjoying how the dark blue of the petals melt into a vibrant purple. It was so vibrant and beautiful it reminded Gendry of something Arya had once said to him.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThey were the prettiest flowers in the world\u201d Arya had mentioned the beauty of Winterfell\u2019s flower to him one day while their group was settling in for the night, before continuing on towards the wall the next day. They had moved away from the rest of the group and were sitting by the side of the river Arya had picked a few flowers nearby as Gendry looked around to make sure no one could hear them. It was one of the first times Arya had opened up about her home after the initial revelation of who she was. Gendry watched curiously as she absentmindedly began to thread the flowers together making a small crown.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice how did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat this?\u201d Arya lifted the flowers up. \u201cMy mother taught my sister and me how to make them. Though Sansa\u2019s were always prettier.\u201d Gendry noticed the sadness\u00a0<b></b>edging its way around Arya\u2019s voice as she thought of her family. Not wanting her to focus on it he offered her another option\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you show me how to make one?\u201d Arya was surprised at the request but quickly agreed. Excitedly plucking more flowers and shoving them into Gendry\u2019s hands. For hours they talked and laughed and made crowns together. Gendry\u2019s hands fumbled a few times in the beginning before he got the hang of it. Arya would later begrudgingly admit that Gendry too was better at making them than she was. He simply blushed and grumbled that it was just because he was used to crafting things as a blacksmith. It became a way to pass time on the road, then it became a way to take their minds off of the horrors of Harrenhal, and as a way to relax and be left alone from the brotherhood.\u00a0</p><p>After Arya was gone Gendry still made crowns. This time to give to the children at the inn. At Least that\u2019s what he told himself. The truth was he didn\u2019t want to sever his last tie to Arya. So he continued to make more. Always with the hope that one day he would get to make her another one, one made with Winterfell flowers as an apology for everything that had happened between them.\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>There were no crowns made when winter came and with it the true war. \u00a0They were reunited now but there was no time for such things. Besides, Gendry had learned the truth of his heritage by that point. And Arya of her aunt\u2019s past. Both would agree that the promise of flower crowns had lost its appeal. Especially with the Targaryen queen and Jon learning of their own intricately woven past and destiny. \u00a0Instead of making crowns Arya and Gendry made up for the lost time and the uncertainty of what the future held in other ways. But if he was honest with himself the thought of seeing Arya one day wearing a flower crown again helped Gendry to push through the fear of the white walkers and fight for their future. \u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>The day that the Night King had fallen was the next time he\u2019d made Arya a new crown. \u00a0Gendry would always remember the moment the Night King was killed. It was the same moment when it seemed the sun broke through the night giving him a chance to look and see who amongst them was still alive. Gendry felt his heart race harder than it had during all the fighting as he looked for Arya who\u2019d he lost sight of at some point in the night. Forcing back the bile that he could feel pressing forward he turned to look for her family she had to be with them. That was the only option. \u00a0And thank the gods it was. Relief washed over him as did the exhaustion of the night before as he sunk to the ground the moment he spotted her hugging her brothers and sister. She spotted him easily, though she too looked ready to fall over as she tried to separate from the family hug. Gendry waved her off silently telling her it was alright hey would have time together after, plenty of time. For now, he was content to simply watch over her. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><b></b></p><p>Later that day however after some sleep Arya found him sitting in the remnants of Winterfell\u2019s forge. They stood apart studying each other neither saying anything before both sets of hands were touching and checking every inch of each other\u2019s bodies. Whether to look for the inevitable injuries that occurred over the night or just to reassure themselves that they were there and safe they couldn\u2019t tell. All they knew was that as they held each other this was the first time they felt true peace in a very long time. \u00a0When Gendry had stumbled through asking her to marry him that day Arya couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m dressed like this you stupid bull?\u201d It was at that moment that Gendry took notice of what she was wearing. It was a rather formal dress, much too formal to wear on a day of recovery. \u00a0Her hair had also been braided much more intricately than usual no doubt Sansa\u2019s handy work. Gendry felt the heat rush to his cheeks.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou look nice\u201d a memory from their past makes him smile as he steps closer to her and takes one of the loose strands left purposefully out of the braid and brings it close to him inhaling the warm scent of perfume. \u201cYou smell nice too\u201d \u00a0Arya pretended to humph and spun out of his arms.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWell you don\u2019t, you stink.\u201d \u00a0she stuck her tongue out childishly at him causing them both to laugh. \u00a0Missing the warmth of her body already Gendry pulls her back towards him.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d He says confidently, watching her head nod in agreement with him. They stay there for just a moment letting themselves bask in how far they\u2019d come. From simply being a Stupid Bull and M\u2019lady to a man and woman in love. \u00a0Once it was over Arya grabbed one of his large hands in both of hers and began to excitedly pull him in the direction of the godswood. There he found her small family waiting for them bundled together in warm Stark cloaks. Sansa holding two more. \u00a0Arya went to move forward to have the Stark cloak placed on her shoulders, but Gendry gently pulled her back.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d there was confusion etched in her voice. Gendry looked around at the\u00a0godswoods and its strange beauty before turning back to her.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWe forgot something. Is it alright to pick flowers in the godswoods?\u201d Arya\u2019s eye lit up shaking her head yes they hurriedly bent down and began picking flowers all around them. Ignoring the curious glances of her family. When they were both done they presented each other with what would become their favorite crowns.\u00a0</p><p>They are often asked if they regretted not waiting to have a major northern ceremony to celebrate the marriage of the young stark princess. But both would say no they were surrounded by flowers, family, and love. They couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Gendry turned his body to look down at his sleeping wife gently he scooped her up in his arms sitting her up against him. Bending his head down to hers he whispered for her that it was time to wake up.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cNo, let me sleep\u201d Arya argued nuzzling her almost winning Gendry over, however, he had seen Ghost spot them a few minutes prior and new that Jon would be searching for them soon</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cWe need to go back Jon\u2019s on his way besides it\u2019s starting to get dark\u201d</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to keep watch Stupid\u201d</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cI did, that\u2019s how I know we need to go M\u2019lady.\u201d Gendry stood up pulling Arya up with him. \u00a0Ignoring Arya rolling her eyes Gendry picked up the flower crown he had been working on for hours as she slept and presented it to her.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t fair yours always look so much more pretty than mine,\u201d Arya said though the happiness in her voice and the awe in her eyes as she inspected the crown told Gendry that she really didn\u2019t mind. \u00a0Gendry took the crown back and placed it on Arya\u2019s head.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because I\u2019ve got to try and make it as beautiful as you. Though I still haven\u2019t achieved that yet.\u201d It was rare to see his wife blushing from a compliment, but Gendry took great pride in it. Especially when Arya tilted her head back to smile up cheekily at him.</p><p><b></b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to keep making more of them then.\u201d \u00a0Gendry could only nod in agreement. With both of their crowns set securely on their heads, Gendry took Arya\u2019s hand and together made their way out of the field of flowers and towards their home. \u00a0</p><p><br></p><p>________________________________</p><p><i>that was it I hope you guys like it!\u00a0 It ended up being much longer than I had anticipated! also highkey if anyone feels the need or has a desire to make some art for this please tag me I would love to see it!</i></p>",
                "content": "<p>Gendry felt the wind as it weaves through his hair and on his cheek. It was summer once more in Winterfell yet the breeze still felt cold. Though not as cold as it was. The dark thoughts lurk around in his mind, but Gendry simply turns his head away focusing on the flowers that were blooming around him instead of thinking about the war. &nbsp;Before the war, the idea of laying down on a hill of flowers was unheard of for a boy like Gendry. One because there were no fields to run and play in, in King&rsquo;s Landing. And two, as a poor boy from Flea Bottom Gendry had no time for such freedoms. But now? Now he had all the time in the world, at least for a while.</p><p>With that in mind, Gendry relaxed back onto the ground arms tucked behind his head as he drifted off into an easy sleep. Not long after his eyes fluttered half open as he felt a small weight land on his head. Through the heaviness of sleep and his dark lashes, he could see Arya hovering over him and smiling widely. She looked absolutely stunning he thought as he was able to watch the loose strands of hair that had fallen from her braid sway and move in the wind. Her cheeks were a healthy shade of red no doubt from running to find him. &nbsp;Turning his eyes away from her he picked up what she dropped on his head and inspected it.
