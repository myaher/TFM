It almost breaks (he swears that now the god is downright blushing) when Tony answers: \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t want to scandalize him with you staying overnight and all\u201d.</p><p>The god swallows and somehow (somehow!) manages to keep all his serious demeanor. He even replies, almost as an afterthought: \u201cAnd bruised, of all things\u201d.</p><!-- more --><p>He\u2019s got a little bit of a situation.</p><p>Tony stares at the back of Loki\u2019s suit (where has he left the cape) for a good couple of seconds before accepting the trickster\u2019s presence in his living room.</p><p>He looks at the clock on the wall as it clicks 3 A.M.</p><p>The inventor would almost concede that he\u2019s fast asleep and dreaming were it not for how Loki sighs and, without even turning to face him, says: \u201cIt\u2019s not chivalrous to fire upon a disarmed opponent\u201d.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Tony would have been suited up by now, but in this moment he feels a pang of concern when he sees the god tightly clutching the sink, trying not to put weight on his right leg as he cleans it with a damp cloth.</p><p>\u201c&hellip;What happened?\u201d</p><p>Loki\u2019s mouth twitches despite himself.</p><p>He\u2019s got a bruise across his left cheekbone. Almost blue. \u201cThe sharp air of New York\u2019s winter damages my princely skin\u201d, he says. His voice is low, very controlled, as if he&rsquo;s trying not to make it obvious that he&rsquo;s speaking through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNew York\u2019s winter air and at least a couple of trucks, for the look of it\u201d.</p><p>Tony approaches him with caution, giving him an assessing look. A certain question shades any kind of drowsiness he may have had: \u201cIs there some imminent, world ending threat?\u201d</p><p>Loki closes him off with a curt: \u201cNot that I know of\u201d.</p><p>Well, now that&rsquo;s a final, totally tranquilizing answer. \u201cF.R.I.D.A.Y.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvengers haven\u2019t been notified with an emergency since you last asked, sir\u201d.</p><p>Tony\u2019s becoming increasingly confused. Why would the god show up in the Avengers\u2019 headquarters if it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of life or death. It&rsquo;s not as if they are besties out of the sudden. They talk, sometimes. Discuss strategies, if S.H.I.E.L.D. happens to consult the god on the magic menace du jour. Even if it&rsquo;s true that the god has taken a shine lately in showing up in his lab (to ask about his projects, show him weird, other worldly materials, but mostly vent about the other team members antics), they are not that close as for being primary contact with this type of emergencies.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Or maybe yes.</p><p>The inventor regrets his words as he realises that the most probable answer is to ask for help and that Loki seems to take his cluelessness as a downright negative, if how his shoulders shag a little and how he winces are anything to go by. He sounds a whole lot angrier when he speaks: \u201cAre you going to throw me out? Now, that\u2019s a level I didn\u2019t expect the great Man of Iron to low himself to\u201d.</p><p>Tony adds, as casually as he\u2019s able to: \u201cNo, I meant here as in, in this room. I keep most my first aid kit by the lab\u2014 I thought you\u2019d had notice it by now\u201d.</p><p>Loki doesn\u2019t reply right away, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Tony is not already making calculations about it. He definitely still has a bottle of peroxide, ice bags galore, probably painkillers (though, which dosis could even have an effect on Loki, if he has his brother\u2019s metabolism?). Now that he\u2019s thinking about it, did he forget to resupply the bandages? He distinctly remembers Pepper nagging him into doing it.</p><p>Loki sighs.</p><p>He looks away and pretends to ignore Tony once again. \u201cGo back to your rooms, Stark. I give you my word that I\u2019m not going to destroy your sorry excuse of a house\u201d, he says.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Tony is taking none of that. \u201cYou\u2019re putting me on the edge, Prince of \u2018Tis but a scratch\u201d, states the inventor. \u201cCome on\u201d, he gently grabs Loki\u2019s arm before waiting for an answer. It\u2019s a statement of just how out of it is Loki that Tony gets to put it over his shoulders to help him move before the god reacts. He clutches on him and makes his way to a chair with as much dignity as he can manage.</p><p>It sits weird in Tony\u2019s stomach, but not in an unpleasant manner. Mister Ice himself, with all the effort he puts in constructing his image of strength and mild boredom, has showed up in his floor in a moment of need. Not Thor&rsquo;s, or Valkyrie&rsquo;s, as he&rsquo;d have expected. His.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s see what we have here\u201d, he says, giving him a once over once he\u2019s sitting down. Between the missing pieces of armour and the ripped clothes that stick at some points of Loki\u2019s chest, Tony can\u2019t tell much. There\u2019s a very easy solution to that, given that the god\u2019s injures also include a very clearly broken leg, but if Tony already doubted if they\u2019d be primary contact for emergencies, he\u2019s pretty sure that his faint friendship with the trickster god doesn\u2019t include that. He decides to push his luck.</p><p>He tries to make it sound as casual as possible as he says: \u201cIt&rsquo;d be better if you stripped, really\u201d.</p><p>The god sighs, as if he\u2019s contemplating his own demise and Tony bites his tongue not to comment that now he\u2019s just being dramatic for the sake of it. With a flair of his hand, his clothes start to disappear.</p><p>Loki\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not quite as built up as Thor, but that doesn\u2019t make him scrawny. He\u2019s lean and he\u2019s got big shoulders and if he got a little bit of a tan (Tony can notice the stark contrast between the hair down his navel, black as a raven \u2014who would have thought that Loki used briefs\u2014), the inventor would almost consider calling him attractive.</p><p>Well, this is not the moment to dwell on that.</p><p>Specially, because what the god seems to be for sure is a tad bit self conscious: he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to decide between looking at the inventor for a reaction \u2014has Tony stayed silent for too long?\u2014 or putting up his walls and pretending that being almost naked in his living room is the most mundane experience of his life.</p><p>\u201cI was not working against Thor\u201d, Loki says, out of nowhere. \u201cOr Asgard, for that matter. Or Midgard, may the All Father forbid\u201d.</p><p>It dawns on Tony that he knows, even if he doesn\u2019t know exactly why. Loki might be an ice cold asshole, but at the end of the day he\u2019s not going to betray them. The inventor gets some ice bags out, a clean cloth and ask one of the robots to get some plaster.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask\u201d, he points out.</p><p>Loki looks at him for a good moment (is this some kind of test) before warning him with: \u201cStark, do not patronize me\u201d.</p><p>Tony finishes to soak some gauze pad with w\u00e1ter and a little bit of soap and pulls a chair to sit next to the god. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully confident for a guy with a concussion\u201d, he taunts him. \u201cI can take care of that\u201d, Tony adds, pointing to a nasty, but superficial gash on Loki\u2019s side. He then points to the god\u2019s shoulder: \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t look broken and hopefully is not. However, your leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>Loki shakes his head. \u201cI can take care of that myself\u201d.</p><p>Well, we\u2019ll see about that.</p><p>Tony starts cleaning Loki\u2019s shoulder with quick, deft movements, paying attention at the changes on the god\u2019s expression. He\u2019s stiff as a rock, breathing in, breathing out slowly and focusing on his leg. When he starts drawing symbols on his leg, a soft golden light surrounding the skin, Tony cannot help but being utterly fascinated, as every time he catches Loki performing magic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not performing a private class, Stark\u201d.</p><p>Tony tries not to smile. He positions the god turning slightly away from him, so he can access the gash at his side.</p><p>He decides to tease him: \u201cWhat? And let me in the hands of Strange?\u201d</p><p>Even if it must sting like hell, Loki is starting to look far less like a zombie, perhaps even a little bit amused: \u201cThe inexperienced, untalented hands of Strange, yes\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou must have taken a big hit to the head\u201d.</p><p>Tony himself has sometimes trouble working as a team with the mage, but he\u2019s still pretty far from the hardcore rivalry that he seems to have developed with Loki. He\u2019s not quite sure why the god cannot stand the guy, though he\u2019s quite confident that the sheer size of their egos might have something to do with the whole issue.</p><p>\u201cBut now that you touch the issue, tell me\u201d, Tony continues. \u201cIf you\u2019re still a firm candidate for the next Asgardian 007 and yet \u2014he makes a gesture encompassing the god\u2019s injures\u2014 this isn\u2019t the result of a mission gone wrong\u2014\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIs this your understanding of how an interrogation must be carried on?\u201d</p><p>Tony gets up for a moment to go to throw away the dirty gauze and breaks the bandage package, as the god attempts to bend his leg ever so slowly. He puts his foot down and relaxes, even if he looks a little bit surprised that it doesn\u2019t hurt quite as much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrogating you. I&rsquo;m just curious. I mean it\u201d, he adds, when Loki arches an eyebrow. He starts wrapping a roll on the god\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have seen how you take a beating from a thing three times your size without even breaking a sweat\u201d.</p><p>He has seen Loki fighting a fellow rocky god he kindly nicknamed \u2018The thing\u2019, an army of dark elves which took New York as their particular gift wrapped Christmas presents a couple of months before and an argue with his and Thor\u2019s older sister \u2014who even knew that she existed\u2014 which quickly got out of hand. Specifically, destroying half the city kind of getting out of hand.</p><p>Loki licks his lower lip, dubitative. Tony doesn\u2019t really want to dwell on why he\u2019s fixating on that kind of instances. When he finishes wrapping the bandage around the god\u2019s midriff, he throws away the package and collects the improvised kitchen first-aid kit, leaving out a couple of ice packs.</p><p>\u201cI run into some unsavoury beings\u201d, he says after a while. It feels as if he thinks that he\u2019s confessing to some kind of crime. \u201cThey happened to assume that a disgraced Asgardian prince would be an easy target for the evening, so I had to prove them wrong\u201d.</p><p>There\u2019s some bitterness there, a kind of inferiority complex centuries in the making that Tony doesn\u2019t feel at all confident enough to touch, specially given that he still knows pretty much just instances about it. He decides for positive reinforcement: \u201cWell, if you look like this I cannot imagine how the other team must be looking\u201d.</p><p>It seems to be the best move, because Loki smiles for real for the first time in the evening. Tony takes into account how Loki\u2019s cheekbone abandons the odd blue and recovers its pale tone when the god carefully presses an ice package to it. \u201cIs that an alien thing, or a magical thing?\u201d</p><p>Loki snorts. \u201cYes, Anthony, that\u2019s an alien thing\u201d.</p><p>Tony smiles. It\u2019s the first time that the god has forgo any kind of formality with him. After weeks on insisting the god on doing it, the inventor feels vindicated and a little bit giddy. He can almost swear that there\u2019s some colour on Loki\u2019s cheeks. He\u2019s tempted to point that out when the god tries to downplay the gesture by saying: \u201cWhat? Did I forget any nobiliary title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, if you ever need me to introduce me in Asgardian style, present me as \u2018King in the North\u201d.</p><p>Loki not only does catch the reference, he even adopts as serious a tone as he can as he answers: \u201cWell, Anthony of House Stark, First of His Name, would His Highness be so kind as to lend me some clothes?\u201d</p><p>Tony tries hard not to grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd a bed, I trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be preferable. If possible, somewhere I don\u2019t have to cross my brother in the morning\u201d.</p><p>Loki\u2019s poker face is a thing of marvel.

Why would the god show up in the Avengers\u2019 headquarters if it wasn\u2019t a matter of life or death. It\u2019s not as if they are besties out of the sudden. They talk, sometimes. Discuss strategies, if S.H.I.E.L.D. happens to consult the god on the magic menace du jour. Even if it\u2019s true that the god has taken a shine lately in showing up in his lab (to ask about his projects, show him weird, other worldly materials, but mostly vent about the other team members antics), they are not that close as for being primary contact with this type of emergencies.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Or maybe yes.</p><p>The inventor regrets his words as he realises that the most probable answer is to ask for help and that Loki seems to take his cluelessness as a downright negative, if how his shoulders shag a little and how he winces are anything to go by.

Now, that\u2019s a level I didn\u2019t expect the great Man of Iron to low himself to\u201d.</p><p>Tony adds, as casually as he\u2019s able to: \u201cNo, I meant here as in, in this room. I keep most my first aid kit by the lab\u2014 I thought you\u2019d had notice it by now\u201d.</p><p>Loki doesn\u2019t reply right away, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Tony is not already making calculations about it. He definitely still has a bottle of peroxide, ice bags galore, probably painkillers (though, which dosis could even have an effect on Loki, if he has his brother\u2019s metabolism?). Now that he\u2019s thinking about it, did he forget to resupply the bandages? He distinctly remembers Pepper nagging him into doing it.</p><p>Loki sighs.</p><p>He looks away and pretends to ignore Tony once again. \u201cGo back to your rooms, Stark. I give you my word that I\u2019m not going to destroy your sorry excuse of a house\u201d, he says.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Tony is taking none of that. \u201cYou\u2019re putting me on the edge, Prince of \u2018Tis but a scratch\u201d, states the inventor. \u201cCome on\u201d, he gently grabs Loki\u2019s arm before waiting for an answer. It\u2019s a statement of just how out of it is Loki that Tony gets to put it over his shoulders to help him move before the god reacts. He clutches on him and makes his way to a chair with as much dignity as he can manage.</p><p>It sits weird in Tony\u2019s stomach, but not in an unpleasant manner. Mister Ice himself, with all the effort he puts in constructing his image of strength and mild boredom, has showed up in his floor in a moment of need. Not Thor\u2019s, or Valkyrie\u2019s, as he\u2019d have expected. His.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s see what we have here\u201d, he says, giving him a once over once he\u2019s sitting down. Between the missing pieces of armour and the ripped clothes that stick at some points of Loki\u2019s chest, Tony can\u2019t tell much. There\u2019s a very easy solution to that, given that the god\u2019s injures also include a very clearly broken leg, but if Tony already doubted if they\u2019d be primary contact for emergencies, he\u2019s pretty sure that his faint friendship with the trickster god doesn\u2019t include that. He decides to push his luck.</p><p>He tries to make it sound as casual as possible as he says: \u201cIt\u2019d be better if you stripped, really\u201d.</p><p>The god sighs, as if he\u2019s contemplating his own demise and Tony bites his tongue not to comment that now he\u2019s just being dramatic for the sake of it. With a flair of his hand, his clothes start to disappear.</p><p>Loki\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not quite as built up as Thor, but that doesn\u2019t make him scrawny. He\u2019s lean and he\u2019s got big shoulders and if he got a little bit of a tan (Tony can notice the stark contrast between the hair down his navel, black as a raven \u2014who would have thought that Loki used briefs\u2014), the inventor would almost consider calling him attractive.</p><p>Well, this is not the moment to dwell on that.</p><p>Specially, because what the god seems to be for sure is a tad bit self conscious: he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to decide between looking at the inventor for a reaction \u2014has Tony stayed silent for too long?\u2014 or putting up his walls and pretending that being almost naked in his living room is the most mundane experience of his life.</p><p>\u201cI was not working against Thor\u201d, Loki says, out of nowhere. \u201cOr Asgard, for that matter. Or Midgard, may the All Father forbid\u201d.</p><p>It dawns on Tony that he knows, even if he doesn\u2019t know exactly why. Loki might be an ice cold asshole, but at the end of the day he\u2019s not going to betray them. The inventor gets some ice bags out, a clean cloth and ask one of the robots to get some plaster.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask\u201d, he points out.</p><p>Loki looks at him for a good moment (is this some kind of test) before warning him with: \u201cStark, do not patronize me\u201d.</p><p>Tony finishes to soak some gauze pad with w\u00e1ter and a little bit of soap and pulls a chair to sit next to the god. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully confident for a guy with a concussion\u201d, he taunts him. \u201cI can take care of that\u201d, Tony adds, pointing to a nasty, but superficial gash on Loki\u2019s side. He then points to the god\u2019s shoulder: \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t look broken and hopefully is not. However, your leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>Loki shakes his head. \u201cI can take care of that myself\u201d.</p><p>Well, we\u2019ll see about that.</p><p>Tony starts cleaning Loki\u2019s shoulder with quick, deft movements, paying attention at the changes on the god\u2019s expression. He\u2019s stiff as a rock, breathing in, breathing out slowly and focusing on his leg. When he starts drawing symbols on his leg, a soft golden light surrounding the skin, Tony cannot help but being utterly fascinated, as every time he catches Loki performing magic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not performing a private class, Stark\u201d.</p><p>Tony tries not to smile. He positions the god turning slightly away from him, so he can access the gash at his side.</p><p>He decides to tease him: \u201cWhat? And let me in the hands of Strange?\u201d</p><p>Even if it must sting like hell, Loki is starting to look far less like a zombie, perhaps even a little bit amused: \u201cThe inexperienced, untalented hands of Strange, yes\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou must have taken a big hit to the head\u201d.</p><p>Tony himself has sometimes trouble working as a team with the mage, but he\u2019s still pretty far from the hardcore rivalry that he seems to have developed with Loki. He\u2019s not quite sure why the god cannot stand the guy, though he\u2019s quite confident that the sheer size of their egos might have something to do with the whole issue.</p><p>\u201cBut now that you touch the issue, tell me\u201d, Tony continues. \u201cIf you\u2019re still a firm candidate for the next Asgardian 007 and yet \u2014he makes a gesture encompassing the god\u2019s injures\u2014 this isn\u2019t the result of a mission gone wrong\u2014\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIs this your understanding of how an interrogation must be carried on?\u201d</p><p>Tony gets up for a moment to go to throw away the dirty gauze and breaks the bandage package, as the god attempts to bend his leg ever so slowly. He puts his foot down and relaxes, even if he looks a little bit surprised that it doesn\u2019t hurt quite as much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrogating you. I\u2019m just curious. I mean it\u201d, he adds, when Loki arches an eyebrow. He starts wrapping a roll on the god\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have seen how you take a beating from a thing three times your size without even breaking a sweat\u201d.</p><p>He has seen Loki fighting a fellow rocky god he kindly nicknamed \u2018The thing\u2019, an army of dark elves which took New York as their particular gift wrapped Christmas presents a couple of months before and an argue with his and Thor\u2019s older sister \u2014who even knew that she existed\u2014 which quickly got out of hand. Specifically, destroying half the city kind of getting out of hand.</p><p>Loki licks his lower lip, dubitative. Tony doesn\u2019t really want to dwell on why he\u2019s fixating on that kind of instances. When he finishes wrapping the bandage around the god\u2019s midriff, he throws away the package and collects the improvised kitchen first-aid kit, leaving out a couple of ice packs.</p><p>\u201cI run into some unsavoury beings\u201d, he says after a while. It feels as if he thinks that he\u2019s confessing to some kind of crime. \u201cThey happened to assume that a disgraced Asgardian prince would be an easy target for the evening, so I had to prove them wrong\u201d.</p><p>There\u2019s some bitterness there, a kind of inferiority complex centuries in the making that Tony doesn\u2019t feel at all confident enough to touch, specially given that he still knows pretty much just instances about it. He decides for positive reinforcement: \u201cWell, if you look like this I cannot imagine how the other team must be looking\u201d.</p><p>It seems to be the best move, because Loki smiles for real for the first time in the evening. Tony takes into account how Loki\u2019s cheekbone abandons the odd blue and recovers its pale tone when the god carefully presses an ice package to it. \u201cIs that an alien thing, or a magical thing?\u201d</p><p>Loki snorts. \u201cYes, Anthony, that\u2019s an alien thing\u201d.</p><p>Tony smiles. It\u2019s the first time that the god has forgo any kind of formality with him. After weeks on insisting the god on doing it, the inventor feels vindicated and a little bit giddy. He can almost swear that there\u2019s some colour on Loki\u2019s cheeks. He\u2019s tempted to point that out when the god tries to downplay the gesture by saying: \u201cWhat? Did I forget any nobiliary title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, if you ever need me to introduce me in Asgardian style, present me as \u2018King in the North\u201d.</p><p>Loki not only does catch the reference, he even adopts as serious a tone as he can as he answers: \u201cWell, Anthony of House Stark, First of His Name, would His Highness be so kind as to lend me some clothes?\u201d</p><p>Tony tries hard not to grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd a bed, I trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be preferable. If possible, somewhere I don\u2019t have to cross my brother in the morning\u201d.</p><p>Loki\u2019s poker face is a thing of marvel. It almost breaks (he swears that now the god is downright blushing) when Tony answers: \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t want to scandalize him with you staying overnight and all\u201d.</p><p>The god swallows and somehow (somehow!) manages to keep all his serious demeanor. Tony really shouldn\u2019t have someone in his life who needs as much supervision as himself. Loki replies, almost as an afterthought: \u201cAnd bruised, of all things\u201d.</p><p>That\u2019s the precise moment when they break out laughing until they are almost crying and their tummies hurt a little.

There\u2019s a very easy solution to that, given that the god\u2019s injures also include a very clearly broken leg, but if Tony already doubted if they\u2019d be primary contact for emergencies, he\u2019s pretty sure that his faint friendship with the trickster god doesn\u2019t include that. He decides to push his luck.</p><p>He tries to make it sound as casual as possible as he says: \u201cIt\u2019d be better if you stripped, really\u201d.</p><p>The god sighs, as if he\u2019s contemplating his own demise and Tony bites his tongue not to comment that now he\u2019s just being dramatic for the sake of it. With a flair of his hand, his clothes start to disappear.</p><p>Loki\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not quite as built up as Thor, but that doesn\u2019t make him scrawny. He\u2019s lean and he\u2019s got big shoulders and if he got a little bit of a tan (Tony can notice the stark contrast between the hair down his navel, black as a raven \u2014who would have thought that Loki used briefs\u2014), the inventor would almost consider calling him attractive.</p><p>Well, this is not the moment to dwell on that.</p><p>Specially, because what the god seems to be for sure is a tad bit self conscious: he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to decide between looking at the inventor for a reaction \u2014has Tony stayed silent for too long?\u2014 or putting up his walls and pretending that being almost naked in his living room is the most mundane experience of his life.</p><p>\u201cI was not working against Thor\u201d, Loki says, out of nowhere. \u201cOr Asgard, for that matter. Or Midgard, may the All Father forbid\u201d.</p><p>It dawns on Tony that he knows, even if he doesn\u2019t know exactly why. Loki might be an ice cold asshole, but at the end of the day he\u2019s not going to betray them. The inventor gets some ice bags out, a clean cloth and ask one of the robots to get some plaster.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask\u201d, he points out.</p><p>Loki looks at him for a good moment (is this some kind of test) before warning him with: \u201cStark, do not patronize me\u201d.</p><p>Tony finishes to soak some gauze pad with w\u00e1ter and a little bit of soap and pulls a chair to sit next to the god. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully confident for a guy with a concussion\u201d, he taunts him. \u201cI can take care of that\u201d, Tony adds, pointing to a nasty, but superficial gash on Loki\u2019s side. He then points to the god\u2019s shoulder: \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t look broken and hopefully is not. However, your leg\u2014\u201d</p><p>Loki shakes his head. \u201cI can take care of that myself\u201d.</p><p>Well, we\u2019ll see about that.</p><p>Tony starts cleaning Loki\u2019s shoulder with quick, deft movements, paying attention at the changes on the god\u2019s expression. He\u2019s stiff as a rock, breathing in, breathing out slowly and focusing on his leg. When he starts drawing symbols on his leg, a soft golden light surrounding the skin, Tony cannot help but being utterly fascinated, as every time he catches Loki performing magic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not performing a private class, Stark\u201d.</p><p>Tony tries not to smile. He positions the god turning slightly away from him, so he can access the gash at his side.</p><p>He decides to tease him: \u201cWhat? And let me in the hands of Strange?\u201d</p><p>Even if it must sting like hell, Loki is starting to look far less like a zombie, perhaps even a little bit amused: \u201cThe inexperienced, untalented hands of Strange, yes\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou must have taken a big hit to the head\u201d.</p><p>Tony himself has sometimes trouble working as a team with the mage, but he\u2019s still pretty far from the hardcore rivalry that he seems to have developed with Loki. He\u2019s not quite sure why the god cannot stand the guy, though he\u2019s quite confident that the sheer size of their egos might have something to do with the whole issue.</p><p>\u201cBut now that you touch the issue, tell me\u201d, Tony continues. \u201cIf you\u2019re still a firm candidate for the next Asgardian 007 and yet \u2014he makes a gesture encompassing the god\u2019s injures\u2014 this isn\u2019t the result of a mission gone wrong\u2014\u201d.</p><p>\u201cIs this your understanding of how an interrogation must be carried on?\u201d</p><p>Tony gets up for a moment to go to throw away the dirty gauze and breaks the bandage package, as the god attempts to bend his leg ever so slowly. He puts his foot down and relaxes, even if he looks a little bit surprised that it doesn\u2019t hurt quite as much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrogating you. I\u2019m just curious. I mean it\u201d, he adds, when Loki arches an eyebrow. He starts wrapping a roll on the god\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI have seen how you take a beating from a thing three times your size without even breaking a sweat\u201d.</p><p>He has seen Loki fighting a fellow rocky god he kindly nicknamed \u2018The thing\u2019, an army of dark elves which took New York as their particular gift wrapped Christmas presents a couple of months before and an argue with his and Thor\u2019s older sister \u2014who even knew that she existed\u2014 which quickly got out of hand. Specifically, destroying half the city kind of getting out of hand.</p><p>Loki licks his lower lip, dubitative. Tony doesn\u2019t really want to dwell on why he\u2019s fixating on that kind of instances. When he finishes wrapping the bandage around the god\u2019s midriff, he throws away the package and collects the improvised kitchen first-aid kit, leaving out a couple of ice packs.</p><p>\u201cI run into some unsavoury beings\u201d, he says after a while. It feels as if he thinks that he\u2019s confessing to some kind of crime. \u201cThey happened to assume that a disgraced Asgardian prince would be an easy target for the evening, so I had to prove them wrong\u201d.</p><p>There\u2019s some bitterness there, a kind of inferiority complex centuries in the making that Tony doesn\u2019t feel at all confident enough to touch, specially given that he still knows pretty much just instances about it. He decides for positive reinforcement: \u201cWell, if you look like this I cannot imagine how the other team must be looking\u201d.</p><p>It seems to be the best move, because Loki smiles for real for the first time in the evening. Tony takes into account how Loki\u2019s cheekbone abandons the odd blue and recovers its pale tone when the god carefully presses an ice package to it. \u201cIs that an alien thing, or a magical thing?\u201d</p><p>Loki snorts. \u201cYes, Anthony, that\u2019s an alien thing\u201d.</p><p>Tony smiles. It\u2019s the first time that the god has forgo any kind of formality with him. After weeks on insisting the god on doing it, the inventor feels vindicated and a little bit giddy. He can almost swear that there\u2019s some colour on Loki\u2019s cheeks. He\u2019s tempted to point that out when the god tries to downplay the gesture by saying: \u201cWhat? Did I forget any nobiliary title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, if you ever need me to introduce me in Asgardian style, present me as \u2018King in the North\u201d.</p><p>Loki not only does catch the reference, he even adopts as serious a tone as he can as he answers: \u201cWell, Anthony of House Stark, First of His Name, would His Highness be so kind as to lend me some clothes?\u201d</p><p>Tony tries hard not to grin.</p><p>\u201cAnd a bed, I trust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be preferable. If possible, somewhere I don\u2019t have to cross my brother in the morning\u201d.</p><p>Loki\u2019s poker face is a thing of marvel. It almost breaks (he swears that now the god is downright blushing) when Tony answers: \u201cOf course, we don\u2019t want to scandalize him with you staying overnight and all\u201d.</p><p>The god swallows and somehow (somehow!) manages to keep all his serious demeanor. Tony really shouldn\u2019t have someone in his life who needs as much supervision as himself. Loki replies, almost as an afterthought: \u201cAnd bruised, of all things\u201d.</p><p>That\u2019s the precise moment when they break out laughing until they are almost crying and their tummies hurt a little. It\u2019s such a liberating experience. So odd that they are doing so in the middle of the night, in the middle of the kitchen. Tony can\u2019t quite remember the last time he felt like that.</p><p>\u201cConsider it done\u201d, he accepts when he catches himself, but giving Loki a look sends them both again into a fit of giggles.</p><p>The clock in the wall strikes 4 a.m.</p><p>Tony sighs. Thinking about the hour, he ponders how he likes to have Loki in one piece in the tower and how he would like him not feel obligated to show up in the middle of the night. The inventor feels the need to point out that: \u201cHowever, if you ever want to crash again on my kitchen. Or, let\u2019s say, if for some unthinkable reason you actually need backup\u2026\u201d</p><p>He does a phone gesture with his hand and hopes that it\u2019s not too ridiculous. <br>Loki loves it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget about it, Anthony\u201d.</p>",

He even replies, almost as an afterthought: &ldquo;And bruised, of all things&rdquo;.</p><p>He&rsquo;s got a little bit of a situation.</p><p>Tony stares at the back of Loki&rsquo;s suit (where has he left the cape) for a good couple of seconds before accepting the trickster&rsquo;s presence in his living room.</p><p>He looks at the clock on the wall as it clicks 3 A.M.</p><p>The inventor would almost concede that he&rsquo;s fast asleep and dreaming were it not for how Loki sighs and, without even turning to face him, says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not chivalrous to fire upon a disarmed opponent&rdquo;.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Tony would have been suited up by now, but in this moment he feels a pang of concern when he sees the god tightly clutching the sink, trying not to put weight on his right leg as he cleans it with a damp cloth.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s mouth twitches despite himself.</p><p>He&rsquo;s got a bruise across his left cheekbone. Almost blue. &ldquo;The sharp air of New York&rsquo;s winter damages my princely skin&rdquo;, he says. His voice is low, very controlled, as if he&rsquo;s trying not to make it obvious that he&rsquo;s speaking through gritted teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;New York&rsquo;s winter air and at least a couple of trucks, for the look of it&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony approaches him with caution, giving him an assessing look. A certain question shades any kind of drowsiness he may have had: &ldquo;Is there some imminent, world ending threat?&rdquo;</p><p>Loki closes him off with a curt: &ldquo;Not that I know of&rdquo;.</p><p>Well, now that&rsquo;s a final, totally tranquilizing answer. &ldquo;F.R.I.D.A.Y.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Avengers haven&rsquo;t been notified with an emergency since you last asked, sir&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s becoming increasingly confused. Why would the god show up in the Avengers&rsquo; headquarters if it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of life or death. It&rsquo;s not as if they are besties out of the sudden. They talk, sometimes. Discuss strategies, if S.H.I.E.L.D. happens to consult the god on the magic menace du jour. Even if it&rsquo;s true that the god has taken a shine lately in showing up in his lab (to ask about his projects, show him weird, other worldly materials, but mostly vent about the other team members antics), they are not that close as for being primary contact with this type of emergencies.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>Or maybe yes.</p><p>The inventor regrets his words as he realises that the most probable answer is to ask for help and that Loki seems to take his cluelessness as a downright negative, if how his shoulders shag a little and how he winces are anything to go by. He sounds a whole lot angrier when he speaks: &ldquo;Are you going to throw me out? Now, that&rsquo;s a level I didn&rsquo;t expect the great Man of Iron to low himself to&rdquo;.</p><p>Tony adds, as casually as he&rsquo;s able to: &ldquo;No, I meant here as in, in this room. I keep most my first aid kit by the lab&mdash; I thought you&rsquo;d had notice it by now&rdquo;.</p><p>Loki doesn&rsquo;t reply right away, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Tony is not already making calculations about it. He definitely still has a bottle of peroxide, ice bags galore, probably painkillers (though, which dosis could even have an effect on Loki, if he has his brother&rsquo;s metabolism?). Now that he&rsquo;s thinking about it, did he forget to resupply the bandages? He distinctly remembers Pepper nagging him into doing it.</p><p>Loki sighs.</p><p>He looks away and pretends to ignore Tony once again. &ldquo;Go back to your rooms, Stark. I give you my word that I&rsquo;m not going to destroy your sorry excuse of a house&rdquo;, he says.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Tony is taking none of that. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re putting me on the edge, Prince of &lsquo;Tis but a scratch&rdquo;, states the inventor. &ldquo;Come on&rdquo;, he gently grabs Loki&rsquo;s arm before waiting for an answer. It&rsquo;s a statement of just how out of it is Loki that Tony gets to put it over his shoulders to help him move before the god reacts. He clutches on him and makes his way to a chair with as much dignity as he can manage.</p><p>It sits weird in Tony&rsquo;s stomach, but not in an unpleasant manner. Mister Ice himself, with all the effort he puts in constructing his image of strength and mild boredom, has showed up in his floor in a moment of need. Not Thor&rsquo;s, or Valkyrie&rsquo;s, as he&rsquo;d have expected. His.</p><p>&ldquo;So, let&rsquo;s see what we have here&rdquo;, he says, giving him a once over once he&rsquo;s sitting down. Between the missing pieces of armour and the ripped clothes that stick at some points of Loki&rsquo;s chest, Tony can&rsquo;t tell much. There&rsquo;s a very easy solution to that, given that the god&rsquo;s injures also include a very clearly broken leg, but if Tony already doubted if they&rsquo;d be primary contact for emergencies, he&rsquo;s pretty sure that his faint friendship with the trickster god doesn&rsquo;t include that. He decides to push his luck.</p><p>He tries to make it sound as casual as possible as he says: &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be better if you stripped, really&rdquo;.</p><p>The god sighs, as if he&rsquo;s contemplating his own demise and Tony bites his tongue not to comment that now he&rsquo;s just being dramatic for the sake of it. With a flair of his hand, his clothes start to disappear.</p><p>Loki&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s not quite as built up as Thor, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him scrawny. He&rsquo;s lean and he&rsquo;s got big shoulders and if he got a little bit of a tan (Tony can notice the stark contrast between the hair down his navel, black as a raven &mdash;who would have thought that Loki used briefs&mdash;), the inventor would almost consider calling him attractive.</p><p>Well, this is not the moment to dwell on that.</p><p>Specially, because what the god seems to be for sure is a tad bit self conscious: he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to decide between looking at the inventor for a reaction &mdash;has Tony stayed silent for too long?&mdash; or putting up his walls and pretending that being almost naked in his living room is the most mundane experience of his life.</p><p>&ldquo;I was not working against Thor&rdquo;, Loki says, out of nowhere. &ldquo;Or Asgard, for that matter.

Five long years, the time\nheist, the stones and Stark\u2019s gauntlet. It all led to the final fight.</p><!-- more --><p>You took a stand next to Tony, intertwining\nyour fingers with his, as you watched an endless number of portals appear across\nthe decimation of Thanos\u2019 attack on the Avengers headquarters. Heroes and warriors\nalike ascended through the newly formed openings, chanting and cheering, as\nthey readied themselves for the fight. </p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Ratchet. It really did\nwork!\u201d Tony had let out a small chuckle, the possibility of winning the war\nbecame extremely apparent in that moment and restored the little hope he had left\nafter five long years of living on a broken planet. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, if this wasn\u2019t such a beautiful moment,\nI\u2019d rip that canned suit off y\u2019body and shove your little nanobots up your ass!\u201d\nRocket sneered, climbing up onto Rhodey\u2019s shoulder. He cocked his gun as Rhodey\nfell in line with Tony. </p><p>Tony smirked, eyes searching the sea of\nheroes that continued to funnel through the portals. Sam, Strange, Bucky, Quill,\nPepper\u2026 Peter. Tony\u2019s hand gripped onto yours, the heat of your touch radiated\nthrough the armour of his suit and brought comfort. \u201cHe\u2019s ok, (Y/N),\u201d you\nturned to him as the helmet of his suit melted away from his face and exposed\nhis gleeful expression, \u201cthe kid\u2019s ok\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ok, Tones,\u201d You replied softly,\nbasking in his newfound joy. You smiled fondly at your husband. </p><p>Tony turned to you as everyone fell in line\nbehind you, he ran his other hand down your arm, which caused you to turn to\nhim. \u201cI love you tons,\u201d he spoke up, barely audible over the army that was\nstill falling in line behind you; Tony clung onto the opportunity to talk to\nyou before this fight, just in case. \u201cFor the love of god be careful, honey.\nWatch your back and please,\u201d he stared into your (y/e/c) eyes, memorising every\ntiny detail of your beautiful, clear irises, as if it was the last time he was\ngoing to see you. He worried his lip between his teeth before he let out a\nsmall huff, \u201ccome back to me after we win\u201d. </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d you pressed a searing but hurried\nkiss to his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll always return to you, my love,\u201d your smile grew as you\nlocked into Tony\u2019s longing gaze. He leaned in for another kiss, but you quickly\nplaced a hand to his armoured chest, halting him. \u201cAh ah ah, not so fast, Mr\nStark,\u201d your smile turned into a lopsided smirk, \u201cthat kiss is reserved for my\nhusband after we win this fight\u2026 so make sure you come back to me\u201d. </p><p>Tony scoffed, accompanied with a playful\neye roll and a matching smirk to yours. His helmet melted back around his head,\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t have it any other way, honey\u201d. He turned towards Thanos\u2019 army, readying\nhimself for the fight ahead of him. Being a mutant who can manipulate the elements:\nearth; fire; wind and water, you used your abilities to push yourself off the\nbattlefield\u2019s floor and into the air alongside Wanda. You took one last look at\nTony, who had taken his own battle stance next between Rhodes and Steve. You admired\nhis determination to continue the fight, and his will to win. Praying to Odin\nthat you would be able to hold him when this all over, you used your wishes to\nenjoy the rest of your life and marriage with Tony to motivate you to win the\nfight. </p><p>\u201cAvengers,\u201d Steve demanded the attention\nof the army that stood behind him, his voice echoed across the battlefield as\nhe stretched his arm out in front of him, calling for Mjolnir. Silence creeped across\nthe battlefield, with only the faint cheers of Thanos\u2019 children and the growls\nof the chitauri filling the void, as they rushed towards the heroes. You sucked\nin a breath, waiting for your orders. T\u2019Challa raised his claws in the form of\nan \u2018X\u2019 across his chest, the Wakandan Army followed suit by readying their weapons\nin a synchronised dance. Pepper, Hope and Wanda were practically glowing with\npower beside you. You allowed the volcanic heat of magma engulf your body, your\narms were alight and aglow with flames, and you were ready to rain hellfire onto\nthe enemy. You were ready to burn through the armour of the purple titan himself.\nGuns were cocked and after what seemed like an eternal pause, Mjolnir flew into\nSteve\u2019s hand and he twisted his body forward as he cried out, \u201cAssemble!\u201d</p><p>You followed behind Tony and Steve as the\narmy surged forward with a ferocious battle cry. Years of repent, mourning and\nanger propelled you all forward and into the fight with determination to destroy\nThanos, his children and the rest of his army, to protect the gauntlet. You\ncommandeered the sky with Rhodes, Wanda, Pepper and Tony whilst Steve, Bucky\nand Banner commanded the Army below. The clash hit both sides hard, Chitauri\nand human blood painted the battlefield and those who fought upon it, almost\ninstantly. </p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>The battle was like an orchestrated dance\nand the main attraction was the gauntlet. As you fought by Thor\u2019s side, you\ntold Wanda to follow Clint across the battlefield, to ensure the safety of both\nhim and the gauntlet. A vortex of wind, water and lightning swallowed both you\nand Thor and wreaked havoc on the Chitauri army. You were an impenetrable\nforce, the forces of nature came together around you and ripped anyone who came\ninto contact with you into pieces. Your fireballs decimated countless Chitauri\nsoldiers and those that dodged them were either ripped apart by the vines you\nhad conjured from the earth or the lightning bolts that were rippling from Thor\u2019s\naxe. There were no survivors. </p><p>The crackling of your comms coaxed you\naway from the fight. The sound of Tony\u2019s pained grunts split through your\nthoughts and you turned your back to Thor, frantically searching for your husband.\nTo your left, up on the broken structure of what was left of the headquarters\nyou were fighting on, was Tony. He was suffering at the hands of Ebony Maw, pinned\ndown by the remains of the HQ\u2019S structural metal beams, his armoured body was\nslowly being crushed and whilst the nanobots were hastily forming around his\nchest to prevent his death, the power of Ebony Maw was becoming too much for\nthe suit to handle. Tony was going to be killed. </p><p>You broke into a run towards Tony.\u00a0</p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>His words echoed in\nyour mind as you allowed the murderous rage that was bubbling in your chest consume\nyour entire body. You furiously clenched your fists as you let every inch of\nyour body be devoured by an intense white flame, radiating the heat of a\nsupernova. With a gut-wrenching scream, you propelled yourself into the sky, instantly\nripping apart any enemy in your path. You locked onto Ebony Maw and you dived\nfrom the sky, allowing the flames that engulfed to intensify with your rage.\nYou impacted the child of Thanos with the power of an atom bomb, obliterating\nhim; you used the skeletal remains as a battering ram to destroy a Leviathan\nabove them. </p><p>The metal beams fell away from Tony\u2019s body\nand he fell to the floor with a gasp, immediately looking up to follow your\nmovements. The repulsors of his suit boosted him into the air, towards your\nfalling form. Burned and limp, your body fell towards the middle of the battlefield.\nTony willed his suit to go faster, determined to catch his wife before she\nmakes impact with the floor, \u201cI got you, honey. Come on, I got you!\u201d He called\nout, panic made his blood run cold from the thought of not catching you; not\ncatching the one person he needed, in time. He pushed his hands out in front of\nhim, straining his arms out as far as humanly possible, readying himself for\nthe impact of your falling form. As you crashed into his arms, he let out a\ngrunt as he pulled you into his chest and barrel rolled to the floor, he let\nhis back take the full force of the floor as you impacted the ground hard. </p><p>Tony laid there for a split second, as the\ndust was kicked up around you both. \u201cFriday, how is she looking?\u201d Tony sat up, he\ngently pushed you off his chest so he could prop you up against the slab of\nconcrete beside you. With a cough, you abruptly woke, groaning at the ache that\nhad settled deep within your bones. The nanobots of Tony\u2019s suit disappeared\naround his face and exposed the worry etched into every inch of his face. You\nwatched his hands shake whilst he propped himself up on one knee and reached\nout to stroke your unprotected shoulder, through one of the many rips in your catsuit.\n</p><p>\u201cOther than clear signs of exhaustion,\n(Y/N)\u2019s vitals are steady. She will be ok, sir.\u201d Friday announced; Tony let out\na breathy laugh in relief. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Friday,\u201d you allowed him to\npet the hair out of your face, letting him look over your features, as you\nregained your strength. A burn ran down the right side of your face and neck, it\nstung at the slightest of movements. You ran your tongue across your lips,\nwincing when you ran it over the gash on your bottom lip, the metallic tang of\nblood flooded your mouth. Tony let out a sigh before placing a tender kiss to\nyour temple.</p><p>\u201cWhy the long sigh? Have we not won yet?\u201d\nYou quipped, voice raspy and war torn. Tony scoffed at your continued ability\nto sass him, even after your near experience with death. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately for you, no, honey\u201d he tried\nnot to fuss over how broken you looked in that moment. They were still in\nbattle. \u201cCan you get back up? Or do I need to get Banner or Strange?\u201d He gripped\nyour arm swiftly after you began to stand, letting you put your weight onto him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, Tones. I got this, don\u2019t you worry\nabout me,\u201d you winced once Tony had helped you to stand straight, you felt the\npull on the various burns and cuts that were the littered across your body; you\nignored the screams for relief from your fatigued muscles. \u201cI got some fight\nleft in me,\u201d you looked up at Tony\u2019s face, locked into his gaze as you give him\na smile, hoping it will dissipate his obvious worry. He nodded in response, taking\nyour hand in his and bringing it up to his lips tenderly. \u201cAre you ok, my love?\nWhen I saw that that\u2026 creature had you pinned, I was completely overcome with\nblind rage,\u201d you shook your head in disbelief, \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything\nlike that before, Tony. I blacked out\u201d. </p><p>Tony chuckled, much to your confusion. \u201cTony,\nwhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, (Y/N). Thanks to you,\u201d he\nsmiled down at you, \u201cyou never fail to me amaze me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, T-\u201c your reply was swiftly cut off by\na nearby explosion, causing you to lose your balance and you toppled into Tony,\ngrabbing at his chest to break your fall. To accommodate for the sudden extra\nweight, Tony had stumbled backwards, preparing to fall on his ass but hands to\nhis lower back and shoulder prevented his fall and pushed him upright, allowing\nyou both to stand. </p><p>\u201cWoah there, Mr Stark. I got you, I got\nyou,\u201d a hoarse voice spoke from behind him, cracking slightly at the end. Your\nears perked up, knowing who the voice belonged to, you let a smile befall your\nface. You looked at Tony expectantly and shooed him off you he checked you over.\nYou watched as he turned to the one person he had been looking forward to\nseeing again. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart damned near stopped when he saw\nPeter standing in front of him, adorning the same suit he wore before the snap\nripped him from Tony\u2019s arms. \u201cHoly cow, Mr Stark. You would not believe-\u201c Peter\u2019s\nface was exposed as his suit fell from his face, his arms waved around in front\nof him. You watched in amusement as Tony stared at the young boy, mouth\nslightly agape as he tried to focus on Peter\u2019s story, \u201cand then I saw him do the\nyellow thingy that he does all the time\u201d. You giggled as Tony cut Peter off by harshly\npulling him into a hug, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Peter questioned, he patted Tony\u2019s\nback hesitantly. </p><p>Tony\u2019s arms were tightly wrapped around\nthe young boy\u2019s slim frame, almost suffocating him, but Peter didn\u2019t mind. \u201cHuh\u201d,\nhe whispered, \u201cthis is nice.\u201d Tony patted Peter\u2019s back firmly and hastily\nplaced a kiss on his cheek. You stepped forward as they both let out a content\nsigh, they were happy to have one another back, tears threatened to spill down\nyour cheeks as you watched their reunion. The last five years for Tony,\nalthough happy with you, were filled with tormented nightmares because of his guilt;\nhe had always blamed himself for the loss of Peter. It was nice to see them together\nagain.</p><p>You placed a gentle had on the small of Tony\u2019s\nback, demanding their attention. \u201cAs much as I hate to interrupt this moment,\nboys,\u201d Tony and Peter unravelled their arms from one another upon hearing your\nvoice, \u201cbut the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d They turned to you, both had tears in\ntheir eyes and a smile on their face, like you. \u201cHi, Pete,\u201d you held your hands\nout to the young boy, letting him envelope you in a hug. </p><p>\u201cHi, (Y/N),\u201d he breathed out into your\nneck, letting you cradle the back of his head and rub his back, just like his\nmother used to. You closed your eyes and breathed in his scent; you had missed him.\n</p><p>You broke apart upon hearing T\u2019Challa\u2019s\nvoice through the comms on Peter\u2019s suit. \u201cI need back up!\u201d His voice was harsh.\nPeter whipped his hear round and spotted T\u2019Challa chasing the gauntlet across\nthe battlefield. </p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming!\u201d He called out,\nletting the suit morph back over his suit he turned to you and Tony. He nodded\nat you before shooting a web in the direction of the battle, swinging towards\nthe gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cBe careful, Pete!\u201d You called out after\nhim, stepping forward slightly. Your voice was hoarse from worry, you prayed he\nknew what he was doing. </p><p>As if he had read your mind, Tony wrapped\nhis hand round your hip and whispered into your ear, \u201cHe\u2019ll be ok, honey. I trust\nhe knows what he is doing.\u201d He placed a soft kiss to your temple, trying to\ncomfort you the only way he knew how. You sighed into his touch. </p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you placed your hand on\ntop of his, patting it gently. \u201cCome on, Iron Man. Lets go finish this!\u201d You\nlooked up at him with a small smile, your determination was evident on your\nface. Tony smiled back, nodding before his helmet melted back around his face. </p><p>\u201cOne last fight\u201d.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>The gauntlet had laid there, out in the\nopen and ready to take. You had Thanos pinned with your thick vines, using the\nlast bit of your energy you had managed to muster when you saw him reaching for\nthe gauntlet, but he was too strong for you. He managed to rip through your\nvines with ease, reaching out to the gauntlet once more. With the help of\nadrenaline, you used your ability to manipulate air to propel you up, and you jumped\nonto the Titan\u2019s shoulders. You placed your hands on each side of his head,\nletting your body temperature rise harshly. With a guttural cry, Thanos winced\naway from the gauntlet, clawing at you to cease your actions. You felt the skin\nbeneath your fingers begin to burn, you clutched onto that feeling as\nmotivation to continue, in the hopes it would kill the titan. With a force of\nhis hand, Thanos was able to grab you by the neck and pull you off his\nshoulders, he held you out in front of him, letting your body dangle from his\nhand. \u201cYou lost, little Stark,\u201d he chuckled as his grip on your neck tightened.\n</p><p>You felt your body spasm under his grip,\nyou thrashed around his hand desperately gasping for air as he continued to squeeze\nthe life out of you. You felt the coldness of dread spread through your veins\nas you watched the smirk on the Titan\u2019s face grow. Your face was surely a sight\nto behold; red, veins bulging from your forehead and your mouth hung open like\na fish out of water. Instead, he walked forward, towards the gauntlet. You clawed\nat his hand in a desperate attempt to stop him, hoping he would relent his vice\ngrip on your neck, but he didn\u2019t even wince at your efforts. Your lungs burned\nand your vision blurred because of your oxygen starved brain, you could only\nhopelessly watch him win once again; he slipped his spare hand into the gauntlet\nand raised it in the air. Thanos looked into your eyes, tears fell down your\ncheeks as you realised this would be the last thing you saw before you die. </p><p>You were never going to see Tony again,\nyou were never going to wake up in his arms, you were never going to start that\nfamily you wanted to after the snap. You would never hear him tell you just how\nmuch he loved you. You weren\u2019t going to come back to him. </p><p>Thanos brought his fingers together,\nchuckled at your tears and spoke with triumph, \u201cI am inevitable!\u201d</p><p>Snap. </p><p>You fell to the ground, hard. Your chest\nheaved as you retched for air, your eyes squeezed shut in fear of seeing those\nyou love disappear once again. You thought it was the end. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201c the disbelief in Thanos\u2019 voice forced\nyour eyes open. You looked up and watched him investigate the gauntlet. As he\nrotated his hand around, you saw the stones were missing, leaving you equally\nconfused. However, a bright light accompanied by the gasp of your husband behind\nyou brought both yours and Thanos\u2019 attention away from the gauntlet. Upon turning\naround, you wished you had never let Tony get involved with any of this. There he\nwas, Tony, donning the stones in his suit. You watched the power of the stones\nwreak havoc on his body, electrifying his arm and you knew he would be left\nwith burns, and worse, he would die. \u201cTony, no!\u201d Your voice was strangled, you\ncrawled towards him in a desperate bid to stop him, your sight blurred by the tears\nthat had gathered in your eyes. </p><p>He smiled adoringly at you, \u201cI love you\ntons, honey\u201d he croaked out, the power of the stones was truly too much for his\nbody. You continued to crawl forward at an agonisingly slow pace, screaming out\nfor him to stop; your throat ripped raw from your crying. Tony looked past you,\ntowards Thanos, his face was defiant. He had won. </p><p>\u201cI&hellip; Am&hellip; Iron Man!\u201d</p><p>Snap.</p><p>\u201cTony! No!\u201d You lunged forward at the last\nsecond, grabbing hold of his wrist as he snapped. You felt the power of the\nstones ricochet through your body, letting the blinding light of the snap\nswallow you whole with Tony. </p><hr><p>Ash rained down across the battlefield. The Chitauri,\nThanos and his children were all annihilated from the snap, their remains\ncoating those who survived the battle. </p><p>You ignored the cheers of the others, scrambling\ntowards Tony\u2019s body. He was propped up against the broken metal structure of\none of headquarters remaining walls, his right arm and side of his head was severely\nburned and irreparable. You cried out, hands hovering over his injuries as you\nscreamed out for help. Your face was soaked by your own tears as you watched\nthe life fade from the only person you have loved. </p><p>You placed a trembling hand on the uninjured side\nof Tony\u2019s face, stroking his cheek gently. \u201cYou\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok. Tony,\nbaby, I love you, ok? I love you tons. You\u2019re ok.\u201d Between every syllable, you\nplaced soft kisses on his cheek, forehead, nose, lips, chin and any other unburnt\npart of his face. Peter dropped to his knees by your side, his body shaking\nwith his own sobs. </p><p>\u201cYou did it, Mr. Stark! You did it\u2026 Tony, I\u2019m\nsorry!\u201d </p><p>You lost all sense of sanity, letting yourself\nhunch over Tony\u2019s dying form as you sobbed into his flickering arc reactor. <i>Come back to me.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>You stroll down the hallway of your beloved cabin. You\neyes scan the numerous pictures that litter the walls: you and Tony on your\nfirst day as an Avenger; you and the Avengers eating out at Schwarmas; you and\nTony on your 1<sup>st</sup> anniversary; Tony and you shortly after he had\nproposed to you, and you both on your wedding day. Happy memories. It\u2019s been 6\nmonths post-second snap and you quickly retreated to the cabin you had made\nyour home after the first snap occurred. </p><p>You smile at the fond memories that are scattered amongst\nthe wall, letting a small huff of air pass your lips. </p><p>\u201cThat better not have been a sigh, Mrs. Stark!\u201d </p><p>You giggle, shaking your head as you turn around to\ngreet your beloved husband. Thanks to Strange, his determination and magic, your\nbeloved Tony would not be standing in front of you right now. The right side to\nhis head is heavily scarred, but with the help of Bruce recently, it has been\nhealing nicely and with a few more sessions, hopefully his skin will regenerate\nas normal. His arm? Gone with the snap, Strange had to amputate it to save his\nlife. You look over his new prosthetic, an arm slightly similar to Bucky\u2019s; but\nwith Tony\u2019s eccentricity its not surprising that it\u2019s the same colour palette\nas Iron Man himself, because <i>we gotta represent,\n(Y/N)</i>. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t a sigh, Tones. Just allowing myself to feel\nnostalgic about some old memories,\u201d you walk towards him with a beaming smile,\nallowing him to envelope you in a strong hug. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmhm,\u201d you affirm, pulling away from his hug. He\nplaces a hand on your stomach, looking down at your growing belly. </p><p>\u201cCan you believe that in the next three months, we\u2019ll\nbe able to tell our little Morgan all about those memories that hang on the\nwalls?\u201d He rubs your stomach in circular motions. </p><p>You smile down at your bump, placing your hand on top\nof Tony\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m more excited at the memories we\u2019re gonna make with little\nMorgan,\u201d you look back up at your husband, catching his adoring look, \u201cyou\u2019re\ngoing to be the best father, I know it\u201d. </p><p>He places a gentle kiss on your lips, leaning his\nforehead against yours, a beaming smile on his face, \u201cand you\u2019re going to be an\nincredible mother, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tones,\u201d you whisper against his lips, \u201cthank\nyou for coming back to me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAlways, (Y/N),\u201d he presses another gentle kiss to\nyour lips as his hand continues to stroke your stomach soothingly, \u201cI love you\u2026\n3000\u201d. You scoff at him as he sniggers, he tickles your sides as you push away\nfrom him. </p><p>Your moment is interrupted by a flushed Peter, who barrels\nhis way through the side door of the cabin, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here, Tony!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwesome, thanks kid! Let\u2019s go greet our guests,\nshall we Mrs Stark?\u201d He looks to you, enclosing your hand with his as he\nintertwines your fingers together. You nod, turning to smile at Pete, holding\nout your other hand for him to take. He does with a giddy smile, following you\nand Tony out the door to greet your guests. </p><p>The back lawn is littered with those who had fought\nby your side, six months ago. Your heart swells at the sight of everyone talking\nand laughing amongst themselves, at your home. Peace has been restored and\neveryone is happy. You feel Tony\u2019s hand on your stomach once more as you\ncontinue to watch your extended family, your smile so wide your cheeks ache,\nbut you can\u2019t find it in yourself to care because everything was perfect. You really\nhave won. </p><hr><p>A/N: I hope you liked it! I wrote this in like 2\nhours after downing a couple cups of coffee, so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s jumpy in a\nfew places or has any raging errors!! I\u2019m aware the ending is quite rushed but I hope you guys can look past that, haha oops! I don\u2019t really write, but I desperately needed\na fix it fic for Tony and the Reader after watching Endgame! I think y\u2019all can\nagree lmfao.

Five long years, the time\nheist, the stones and Stark\u2019s gauntlet. It all led to the final fight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You took a stand next to Tony, intertwining\nyour fingers with his, as you watched an endless number of portals appear across\nthe decimation of Thanos\u2019 attack on the Avengers headquarters. Heroes and warriors\nalike ascended through the newly formed openings, chanting and cheering, as\nthey readied themselves for the fight. </p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Ratchet. It really did\nwork!\u201d Tony had let out a small chuckle, the possibility of winning the war\nbecame extremely apparent in that moment and restored the little hope he had left\nafter five long years of living on a broken planet. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, if this wasn\u2019t such a beautiful moment,\nI\u2019d rip that canned suit off y\u2019body and shove your little nanobots up your ass!\u201d\nRocket sneered, climbing up onto Rhodey\u2019s shoulder. He cocked his gun as Rhodey\nfell in line with Tony. </p><p>Tony smirked, eyes searching the sea of\nheroes that continued to funnel through the portals. Sam, Strange, Bucky, Quill,\nPepper\u2026 Peter. Tony\u2019s hand gripped onto yours, the heat of your touch radiated\nthrough the armour of his suit and brought comfort. \u201cHe\u2019s ok, (Y/N),\u201d you\nturned to him as the helmet of his suit melted away from his face and exposed\nhis gleeful expression, \u201cthe kid\u2019s ok\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ok, Tones,\u201d You replied softly,\nbasking in his newfound joy. You smiled fondly at your husband. </p><p>Tony turned to you as everyone fell in line\nbehind you, he ran his other hand down your arm, which caused you to turn to\nhim. \u201cI love you tons,\u201d he spoke up, barely audible over the army that was\nstill falling in line behind you; Tony clung onto the opportunity to talk to\nyou before this fight, just in case. \u201cFor the love of god be careful, honey.\nWatch your back and please,\u201d he stared into your (y/e/c) eyes, memorising every\ntiny detail of your beautiful, clear irises, as if it was the last time he was\ngoing to see you. He worried his lip between his teeth before he let out a\nsmall huff, \u201ccome back to me after we win\u201d. </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d you pressed a searing but hurried\nkiss to his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll always return to you, my love,\u201d your smile grew as you\nlocked into Tony\u2019s longing gaze. He leaned in for another kiss, but you quickly\nplaced a hand to his armoured chest, halting him. \u201cAh ah ah, not so fast, Mr\nStark,\u201d your smile turned into a lopsided smirk, \u201cthat kiss is reserved for my\nhusband after we win this fight\u2026 so make sure you come back to me\u201d. </p><p>Tony scoffed, accompanied with a playful\neye roll and a matching smirk to yours. His helmet melted back around his head,\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t have it any other way, honey\u201d. He turned towards Thanos\u2019 army, readying\nhimself for the fight ahead of him. Being a mutant who can manipulate the elements:\nearth; fire; wind and water, you used your abilities to push yourself off the\nbattlefield\u2019s floor and into the air alongside Wanda. You took one last look at\nTony, who had taken his own battle stance next between Rhodes and Steve. You admired\nhis determination to continue the fight, and his will to win. Praying to Odin\nthat you would be able to hold him when this all over, you used your wishes to\nenjoy the rest of your life and marriage with Tony to motivate you to win the\nfight. </p><p>\u201cAvengers,\u201d Steve demanded the attention\nof the army that stood behind him, his voice echoed across the battlefield as\nhe stretched his arm out in front of him, calling for Mjolnir. Silence creeped across\nthe battlefield, with only the faint cheers of Thanos\u2019 children and the growls\nof the chitauri filling the void, as they rushed towards the heroes. You sucked\nin a breath, waiting for your orders. T\u2019Challa raised his claws in the form of\nan \u2018X\u2019 across his chest, the Wakandan Army followed suit by readying their weapons\nin a synchronised dance. Pepper, Hope and Wanda were practically glowing with\npower beside you. You allowed the volcanic heat of magma engulf your body, your\narms were alight and aglow with flames, and you were ready to rain hellfire onto\nthe enemy. You were ready to burn through the armour of the purple titan himself.\nGuns were cocked and after what seemed like an eternal pause, Mjolnir flew into\nSteve\u2019s hand and he twisted his body forward as he cried out, \u201cAssemble!\u201d</p><p>You followed behind Tony and Steve as the\narmy surged forward with a ferocious battle cry. Years of repent, mourning and\nanger propelled you all forward and into the fight with determination to destroy\nThanos, his children and the rest of his army, to protect the gauntlet. You\ncommandeered the sky with Rhodes, Wanda, Pepper and Tony whilst Steve, Bucky\nand Banner commanded the Army below. The clash hit both sides hard, Chitauri\nand human blood painted the battlefield and those who fought upon it, almost\ninstantly. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The battle was like an orchestrated dance\nand the main attraction was the gauntlet. As you fought by Thor\u2019s side, you\ntold Wanda to follow Clint across the battlefield, to ensure the safety of both\nhim and the gauntlet. A vortex of wind, water and lightning swallowed both you\nand Thor and wreaked havoc on the Chitauri army. You were an impenetrable\nforce, the forces of nature came together around you and ripped anyone who came\ninto contact with you into pieces. Your fireballs decimated countless Chitauri\nsoldiers and those that dodged them were either ripped apart by the vines you\nhad conjured from the earth or the lightning bolts that were rippling from Thor\u2019s\naxe. There were no survivors. </p><p>The crackling of your comms coaxed you\naway from the fight. The sound of Tony\u2019s pained grunts split through your\nthoughts and you turned your back to Thor, frantically searching for your husband.\nTo your left, up on the broken structure of what was left of the headquarters\nyou were fighting on, was Tony. He was suffering at the hands of Ebony Maw, pinned\ndown by the remains of the HQ\u2019S structural metal beams, his armoured body was\nslowly being crushed and whilst the nanobots were hastily forming around his\nchest to prevent his death, the power of Ebony Maw was becoming too much for\nthe suit to handle. Tony was going to be killed. </p><p>You broke into a run towards Tony.\u00a0</p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>His words echoed in\nyour mind as you allowed the murderous rage that was bubbling in your chest consume\nyour entire body. You furiously clenched your fists as you let every inch of\nyour body be devoured by an intense white flame, radiating the heat of a\nsupernova. With a gut-wrenching scream, you propelled yourself into the sky, instantly\nripping apart any enemy in your path. You locked onto Ebony Maw and you dived\nfrom the sky, allowing the flames that engulfed to intensify with your rage.\nYou impacted the child of Thanos with the power of an atom bomb, obliterating\nhim; you used the skeletal remains as a battering ram to destroy a Leviathan\nabove them. </p><p>The metal beams fell away from Tony\u2019s body\nand he fell to the floor with a gasp, immediately looking up to follow your\nmovements. The repulsors of his suit boosted him into the air, towards your\nfalling form. Burned and limp, your body fell towards the middle of the battlefield.\nTony willed his suit to go faster, determined to catch his wife before she\nmakes impact with the floor, \u201cI got you, honey. Come on, I got you!\u201d He called\nout, panic made his blood run cold from the thought of not catching you; not\ncatching the one person he needed, in time. He pushed his hands out in front of\nhim, straining his arms out as far as humanly possible, readying himself for\nthe impact of your falling form. As you crashed into his arms, he let out a\ngrunt as he pulled you into his chest and barrel rolled to the floor, he let\nhis back take the full force of the floor as you impacted the ground hard. </p><p>Tony laid there for a split second, as the\ndust was kicked up around you both. \u201cFriday, how is she looking?\u201d Tony sat up, he\ngently pushed you off his chest so he could prop you up against the slab of\nconcrete beside you. With a cough, you abruptly woke, groaning at the ache that\nhad settled deep within your bones. The nanobots of Tony\u2019s suit disappeared\naround his face and exposed the worry etched into every inch of his face. You\nwatched his hands shake whilst he propped himself up on one knee and reached\nout to stroke your unprotected shoulder, through one of the many rips in your catsuit.\n</p><p>\u201cOther than clear signs of exhaustion,\n(Y/N)\u2019s vitals are steady. She will be ok, sir.\u201d Friday announced; Tony let out\na breathy laugh in relief. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Friday,\u201d you allowed him to\npet the hair out of your face, letting him look over your features, as you\nregained your strength. A burn ran down the right side of your face and neck, it\nstung at the slightest of movements. You ran your tongue across your lips,\nwincing when you ran it over the gash on your bottom lip, the metallic tang of\nblood flooded your mouth. Tony let out a sigh before placing a tender kiss to\nyour temple.</p><p>\u201cWhy the long sigh? Have we not won yet?\u201d\nYou quipped, voice raspy and war torn. Tony scoffed at your continued ability\nto sass him, even after your near experience with death. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately for you, no, honey\u201d he tried\nnot to fuss over how broken you looked in that moment. They were still in\nbattle. \u201cCan you get back up? Or do I need to get Banner or Strange?\u201d He gripped\nyour arm swiftly after you began to stand, letting you put your weight onto him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, Tones. I got this, don\u2019t you worry\nabout me,\u201d you winced once Tony had helped you to stand straight, you felt the\npull on the various burns and cuts that were the littered across your body; you\nignored the screams for relief from your fatigued muscles. \u201cI got some fight\nleft in me,\u201d you looked up at Tony\u2019s face, locked into his gaze as you give him\na smile, hoping it will dissipate his obvious worry. He nodded in response, taking\nyour hand in his and bringing it up to his lips tenderly. \u201cAre you ok, my love?\nWhen I saw that that\u2026 creature had you pinned, I was completely overcome with\nblind rage,\u201d you shook your head in disbelief, \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything\nlike that before, Tony. I blacked out\u201d. </p><p>Tony chuckled, much to your confusion. \u201cTony,\nwhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, (Y/N). Thanks to you,\u201d he\nsmiled down at you, \u201cyou never fail to me amaze me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, T-\u201c your reply was swiftly cut off by\na nearby explosion, causing you to lose your balance and you toppled into Tony,\ngrabbing at his chest to break your fall. To accommodate for the sudden extra\nweight, Tony had stumbled backwards, preparing to fall on his ass but hands to\nhis lower back and shoulder prevented his fall and pushed him upright, allowing\nyou both to stand. </p><p>\u201cWoah there, Mr Stark. I got you, I got\nyou,\u201d a hoarse voice spoke from behind him, cracking slightly at the end. Your\nears perked up, knowing who the voice belonged to, you let a smile befall your\nface. You looked at Tony expectantly and shooed him off you he checked you over.\nYou watched as he turned to the one person he had been looking forward to\nseeing again. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart damned near stopped when he saw\nPeter standing in front of him, adorning the same suit he wore before the snap\nripped him from Tony\u2019s arms. \u201cHoly cow, Mr Stark. You would not believe-\u201c Peter\u2019s\nface was exposed as his suit fell from his face, his arms waved around in front\nof him. You watched in amusement as Tony stared at the young boy, mouth\nslightly agape as he tried to focus on Peter\u2019s story, \u201cand then I saw him do the\nyellow thingy that he does all the time\u201d. You giggled as Tony cut Peter off by harshly\npulling him into a hug, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Peter questioned, he patted Tony\u2019s\nback hesitantly. </p><p>Tony\u2019s arms were tightly wrapped around\nthe young boy\u2019s slim frame, almost suffocating him, but Peter didn\u2019t mind. \u201cHuh\u201d,\nhe whispered, \u201cthis is nice.\u201d Tony patted Peter\u2019s back firmly and hastily\nplaced a kiss on his cheek. You stepped forward as they both let out a content\nsigh, they were happy to have one another back, tears threatened to spill down\nyour cheeks as you watched their reunion. The last five years for Tony,\nalthough happy with you, were filled with tormented nightmares because of his guilt;\nhe had always blamed himself for the loss of Peter. It was nice to see them together\nagain.</p><p>You placed a gentle had on the small of Tony\u2019s\nback, demanding their attention. \u201cAs much as I hate to interrupt this moment,\nboys,\u201d Tony and Peter unravelled their arms from one another upon hearing your\nvoice, \u201cbut the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d They turned to you, both had tears in\ntheir eyes and a smile on their face, like you. \u201cHi, Pete,\u201d you held your hands\nout to the young boy, letting him envelope you in a hug. </p><p>\u201cHi, (Y/N),\u201d he breathed out into your\nneck, letting you cradle the back of his head and rub his back, just like his\nmother used to. You closed your eyes and breathed in his scent; you had missed him.\n</p><p>You broke apart upon hearing T\u2019Challa\u2019s\nvoice through the comms on Peter\u2019s suit. \u201cI need back up!\u201d His voice was harsh.\nPeter whipped his hear round and spotted T\u2019Challa chasing the gauntlet across\nthe battlefield. </p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming!\u201d He called out,\nletting the suit morph back over his suit he turned to you and Tony. He nodded\nat you before shooting a web in the direction of the battle, swinging towards\nthe gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cBe careful, Pete!\u201d You called out after\nhim, stepping forward slightly. Your voice was hoarse from worry, you prayed he\nknew what he was doing. </p><p>As if he had read your mind, Tony wrapped\nhis hand round your hip and whispered into your ear, \u201cHe\u2019ll be ok, honey. I trust\nhe knows what he is doing.\u201d He placed a soft kiss to your temple, trying to\ncomfort you the only way he knew how. You sighed into his touch. </p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you placed your hand on\ntop of his, patting it gently. \u201cCome on, Iron Man. Lets go finish this!\u201d You\nlooked up at him with a small smile, your determination was evident on your\nface. Tony smiled back, nodding before his helmet melted back around his face. </p><p>\u201cOne last fight\u201d.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The gauntlet had laid there, out in the\nopen and ready to take. You had Thanos pinned with your thick vines, using the\nlast bit of your energy you had managed to muster when you saw him reaching for\nthe gauntlet, but he was too strong for you. He managed to rip through your\nvines with ease, reaching out to the gauntlet once more. With the help of\nadrenaline, you used your ability to manipulate air to propel you up, and you jumped\nonto the Titan\u2019s shoulders. You placed your hands on each side of his head,\nletting your body temperature rise harshly. With a guttural cry, Thanos winced\naway from the gauntlet, clawing at you to cease your actions. You felt the skin\nbeneath your fingers begin to burn, you clutched onto that feeling as\nmotivation to continue, in the hopes it would kill the titan. With a force of\nhis hand, Thanos was able to grab you by the neck and pull you off his\nshoulders, he held you out in front of him, letting your body dangle from his\nhand. \u201cYou lost, little Stark,\u201d he chuckled as his grip on your neck tightened.\n</p><p>You felt your body spasm under his grip,\nyou thrashed around his hand desperately gasping for air as he continued to squeeze\nthe life out of you. You felt the coldness of dread spread through your veins\nas you watched the smirk on the Titan\u2019s face grow. Your face was surely a sight\nto behold; red, veins bulging from your forehead and your mouth hung open like\na fish out of water. Instead, he walked forward, towards the gauntlet. You clawed\nat his hand in a desperate attempt to stop him, hoping he would relent his vice\ngrip on your neck, but he didn\u2019t even wince at your efforts. Your lungs burned\nand your vision blurred because of your oxygen starved brain, you could only\nhopelessly watch him win once again; he slipped his spare hand into the gauntlet\nand raised it in the air. Thanos looked into your eyes, tears fell down your\ncheeks as you realised this would be the last thing you saw before you die. </p><p>You were never going to see Tony again,\nyou were never going to wake up in his arms, you were never going to start that\nfamily you wanted to after the snap. You would never hear him tell you just how\nmuch he loved you. You weren\u2019t going to come back to him. </p><p>Thanos brought his fingers together,\nchuckled at your tears and spoke with triumph, \u201cI am inevitable!\u201d</p><p>Snap. </p><p>You fell to the ground, hard. Your chest\nheaved as you retched for air, your eyes squeezed shut in fear of seeing those\nyou love disappear once again. You thought it was the end. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201c the disbelief in Thanos\u2019 voice forced\nyour eyes open. You looked up and watched him investigate the gauntlet. As he\nrotated his hand around, you saw the stones were missing, leaving you equally\nconfused. However, a bright light accompanied by the gasp of your husband behind\nyou brought both yours and Thanos\u2019 attention away from the gauntlet. Upon turning\naround, you wished you had never let Tony get involved with any of this. There he\nwas, Tony, donning the stones in his suit. You watched the power of the stones\nwreak havoc on his body, electrifying his arm and you knew he would be left\nwith burns, and worse, he would die. \u201cTony, no!\u201d Your voice was strangled, you\ncrawled towards him in a desperate bid to stop him, your sight blurred by the tears\nthat had gathered in your eyes. </p><p>He smiled adoringly at you, \u201cI love you\ntons, honey\u201d he croaked out, the power of the stones was truly too much for his\nbody. You continued to crawl forward at an agonisingly slow pace, screaming out\nfor him to stop; your throat ripped raw from your crying. Tony looked past you,\ntowards Thanos, his face was defiant. He had won. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 Am\u2026 Iron Man!\u201d</p><p>Snap.</p><p>\u201cTony! No!\u201d You lunged forward at the last\nsecond, grabbing hold of his wrist as he snapped. You felt the power of the\nstones ricochet through your body, letting the blinding light of the snap\nswallow you whole with Tony. </p><hr><p>Ash rained down across the battlefield. The Chitauri,\nThanos and his children were all annihilated from the snap, their remains\ncoating those who survived the battle. </p><p>You ignored the cheers of the others, scrambling\ntowards Tony\u2019s body. He was propped up against the broken metal structure of\none of headquarters remaining walls, his right arm and side of his head was severely\nburned and irreparable. You cried out, hands hovering over his injuries as you\nscreamed out for help. Your face was soaked by your own tears as you watched\nthe life fade from the only person you have loved. </p><p>You placed a trembling hand on the uninjured side\nof Tony\u2019s face, stroking his cheek gently. \u201cYou\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok. Tony,\nbaby, I love you, ok? I love you tons. You\u2019re ok.\u201d Between every syllable, you\nplaced soft kisses on his cheek, forehead, nose, lips, chin and any other unburnt\npart of his face. Peter dropped to his knees by your side, his body shaking\nwith his own sobs. </p><p>\u201cYou did it, Mr. Stark! You did it\u2026 Tony, I\u2019m\nsorry!\u201d </p><p>You lost all sense of sanity, letting yourself\nhunch over Tony\u2019s dying form as you sobbed into his flickering arc reactor. <i>Come back to me.</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You stroll down the hallway of your beloved cabin. You\neyes scan the numerous pictures that litter the walls: you and Tony on your\nfirst day as an Avenger; you and the Avengers eating out at Schwarmas; you and\nTony on your 1<sup>st</sup> anniversary; Tony and you shortly after he had\nproposed to you, and you both on your wedding day. Happy memories. It\u2019s been 6\nmonths post-second snap and you quickly retreated to the cabin you had made\nyour home after the first snap occurred. </p><p>You smile at the fond memories that are scattered amongst\nthe wall, letting a small huff of air pass your lips. </p><p>\u201cThat better not have been a sigh, Mrs. Stark!\u201d </p><p>You giggle, shaking your head as you turn around to\ngreet your beloved husband. Thanks to Strange, his determination and magic, your\nbeloved Tony would not be standing in front of you right now. The right side to\nhis head is heavily scarred, but with the help of Bruce recently, it has been\nhealing nicely and with a few more sessions, hopefully his skin will regenerate\nas normal. His arm? Gone with the snap, Strange had to amputate it to save his\nlife. You look over his new prosthetic, an arm slightly similar to Bucky\u2019s; but\nwith Tony\u2019s eccentricity its not surprising that it\u2019s the same colour palette\nas Iron Man himself, because <i>we gotta represent,\n(Y/N)</i>. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t a sigh, Tones. Just allowing myself to feel\nnostalgic about some old memories,\u201d you walk towards him with a beaming smile,\nallowing him to envelope you in a strong hug. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmhm,\u201d you affirm, pulling away from his hug. He\nplaces a hand on your stomach, looking down at your growing belly. </p><p>\u201cCan you believe that in the next three months, we\u2019ll\nbe able to tell our little Morgan all about those memories that hang on the\nwalls?\u201d He rubs your stomach in circular motions. </p><p>You smile down at your bump, placing your hand on top\nof Tony\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m more excited at the memories we\u2019re gonna make with little\nMorgan,\u201d you look back up at your husband, catching his adoring look, \u201cyou\u2019re\ngoing to be the best father, I know it\u201d. </p><p>He places a gentle kiss on your lips, leaning his\nforehead against yours, a beaming smile on his face, \u201cand you\u2019re going to be an\nincredible mother, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tones,\u201d you whisper against his lips, \u201cthank\nyou for coming back to me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAlways, (Y/N),\u201d he presses another gentle kiss to\nyour lips as his hand continues to stroke your stomach soothingly, \u201cI love you\u2026\n3000\u201d. You scoff at him as he sniggers, he tickles your sides as you push away\nfrom him. </p><p>Your moment is interrupted by a flushed Peter, who barrels\nhis way through the side door of the cabin, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here, Tony!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwesome, thanks kid! Let\u2019s go greet our guests,\nshall we Mrs Stark?\u201d He looks to you, enclosing your hand with his as he\nintertwines your fingers together. You nod, turning to smile at Pete, holding\nout your other hand for him to take. He does with a giddy smile, following you\nand Tony out the door to greet your guests. </p><p>The back lawn is littered with those who had fought\nby your side, six months ago. Your heart swells at the sight of everyone talking\nand laughing amongst themselves, at your home. Peace has been restored and\neveryone is happy. You feel Tony\u2019s hand on your stomach once more as you\ncontinue to watch your extended family, your smile so wide your cheeks ache,\nbut you can\u2019t find it in yourself to care because everything was perfect. You really\nhave won. </p><hr><p>A/N: I hope you liked it! I wrote this in like 2\nhours after downing a couple cups of coffee, so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s jumpy in a\nfew places or has any raging errors!! I\u2019m aware the ending is quite rushed but I hope you guys can look past that, haha oops! I don\u2019t really write, but I desperately needed\na fix it fic for Tony and the Reader after watching Endgame! I think y\u2019all can\nagree lmfao. Feel free to send me requests, I may be inspired by it and write a\nlittle something for you! I\u2019m so bored recently ;/</p></p>",

Five long years, the time\nheist, the stones and Stark\u2019s gauntlet. It all led to the final fight.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You took a stand next to Tony, intertwining\nyour fingers with his, as you watched an endless number of portals appear across\nthe decimation of Thanos\u2019 attack on the Avengers headquarters. Heroes and warriors\nalike ascended through the newly formed openings, chanting and cheering, as\nthey readied themselves for the fight. </p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Ratchet. It really did\nwork!\u201d Tony had let out a small chuckle, the possibility of winning the war\nbecame extremely apparent in that moment and restored the little hope he had left\nafter five long years of living on a broken planet. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, if this wasn\u2019t such a beautiful moment,\nI\u2019d rip that canned suit off y\u2019body and shove your little nanobots up your ass!\u201d\nRocket sneered, climbing up onto Rhodey\u2019s shoulder. He cocked his gun as Rhodey\nfell in line with Tony. </p><p>Tony smirked, eyes searching the sea of\nheroes that continued to funnel through the portals. Sam, Strange, Bucky, Quill,\nPepper\u2026 Peter. Tony\u2019s hand gripped onto yours, the heat of your touch radiated\nthrough the armour of his suit and brought comfort. \u201cHe\u2019s ok, (Y/N),\u201d you\nturned to him as the helmet of his suit melted away from his face and exposed\nhis gleeful expression, \u201cthe kid\u2019s ok\u201d.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ok, Tones,\u201d You replied softly,\nbasking in his newfound joy. You smiled fondly at your husband. </p><p>Tony turned to you as everyone fell in line\nbehind you, he ran his other hand down your arm, which caused you to turn to\nhim. \u201cI love you tons,\u201d he spoke up, barely audible over the army that was\nstill falling in line behind you; Tony clung onto the opportunity to talk to\nyou before this fight, just in case. \u201cFor the love of god be careful, honey.\nWatch your back and please,\u201d he stared into your (y/e/c) eyes, memorising every\ntiny detail of your beautiful, clear irises, as if it was the last time he was\ngoing to see you. He worried his lip between his teeth before he let out a\nsmall huff, \u201ccome back to me after we win\u201d. </p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d you pressed a searing but hurried\nkiss to his lips, \u201cI\u2019ll always return to you, my love,\u201d your smile grew as you\nlocked into Tony\u2019s longing gaze. He leaned in for another kiss, but you quickly\nplaced a hand to his armoured chest, halting him. \u201cAh ah ah, not so fast, Mr\nStark,\u201d your smile turned into a lopsided smirk, \u201cthat kiss is reserved for my\nhusband after we win this fight\u2026 so make sure you come back to me\u201d. </p><p>Tony scoffed, accompanied with a playful\neye roll and a matching smirk to yours. His helmet melted back around his head,\n\u201cwouldn\u2019t have it any other way, honey\u201d. He turned towards Thanos\u2019 army, readying\nhimself for the fight ahead of him. Being a mutant who can manipulate the elements:\nearth; fire; wind and water, you used your abilities to push yourself off the\nbattlefield\u2019s floor and into the air alongside Wanda. You took one last look at\nTony, who had taken his own battle stance next between Rhodes and Steve. You admired\nhis determination to continue the fight, and his will to win. Praying to Odin\nthat you would be able to hold him when this all over, you used your wishes to\nenjoy the rest of your life and marriage with Tony to motivate you to win the\nfight. </p><p>\u201cAvengers,\u201d Steve demanded the attention\nof the army that stood behind him, his voice echoed across the battlefield as\nhe stretched his arm out in front of him, calling for Mjolnir. Silence creeped across\nthe battlefield, with only the faint cheers of Thanos\u2019 children and the growls\nof the chitauri filling the void, as they rushed towards the heroes. You sucked\nin a breath, waiting for your orders. T\u2019Challa raised his claws in the form of\nan \u2018X\u2019 across his chest, the Wakandan Army followed suit by readying their weapons\nin a synchronised dance. Pepper, Hope and Wanda were practically glowing with\npower beside you. You allowed the volcanic heat of magma engulf your body, your\narms were alight and aglow with flames, and you were ready to rain hellfire onto\nthe enemy. You were ready to burn through the armour of the purple titan himself.\nGuns were cocked and after what seemed like an eternal pause, Mjolnir flew into\nSteve\u2019s hand and he twisted his body forward as he cried out, \u201cAssemble!\u201d</p><p>You followed behind Tony and Steve as the\narmy surged forward with a ferocious battle cry. Years of repent, mourning and\nanger propelled you all forward and into the fight with determination to destroy\nThanos, his children and the rest of his army, to protect the gauntlet. You\ncommandeered the sky with Rhodes, Wanda, Pepper and Tony whilst Steve, Bucky\nand Banner commanded the Army below. The clash hit both sides hard, Chitauri\nand human blood painted the battlefield and those who fought upon it, almost\ninstantly. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The battle was like an orchestrated dance\nand the main attraction was the gauntlet. As you fought by Thor\u2019s side, you\ntold Wanda to follow Clint across the battlefield, to ensure the safety of both\nhim and the gauntlet. A vortex of wind, water and lightning swallowed both you\nand Thor and wreaked havoc on the Chitauri army. You were an impenetrable\nforce, the forces of nature came together around you and ripped anyone who came\ninto contact with you into pieces. Your fireballs decimated countless Chitauri\nsoldiers and those that dodged them were either ripped apart by the vines you\nhad conjured from the earth or the lightning bolts that were rippling from Thor\u2019s\naxe. There were no survivors. </p><p>The crackling of your comms coaxed you\naway from the fight. The sound of Tony\u2019s pained grunts split through your\nthoughts and you turned your back to Thor, frantically searching for your husband.\nTo your left, up on the broken structure of what was left of the headquarters\nyou were fighting on, was Tony. He was suffering at the hands of Ebony Maw, pinned\ndown by the remains of the HQ\u2019S structural metal beams, his armoured body was\nslowly being crushed and whilst the nanobots were hastily forming around his\nchest to prevent his death, the power of Ebony Maw was becoming too much for\nthe suit to handle. Tony was going to be killed. </p><p>You broke into a run towards Tony.\u00a0</p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>His words echoed in\nyour mind as you allowed the murderous rage that was bubbling in your chest consume\nyour entire body. You furiously clenched your fists as you let every inch of\nyour body be devoured by an intense white flame, radiating the heat of a\nsupernova. With a gut-wrenching scream, you propelled yourself into the sky, instantly\nripping apart any enemy in your path. You locked onto Ebony Maw and you dived\nfrom the sky, allowing the flames that engulfed to intensify with your rage.\nYou impacted the child of Thanos with the power of an atom bomb, obliterating\nhim; you used the skeletal remains as a battering ram to destroy a Leviathan\nabove them. </p><p>The metal beams fell away from Tony\u2019s body\nand he fell to the floor with a gasp, immediately looking up to follow your\nmovements. The repulsors of his suit boosted him into the air, towards your\nfalling form. Burned and limp, your body fell towards the middle of the battlefield.\nTony willed his suit to go faster, determined to catch his wife before she\nmakes impact with the floor, \u201cI got you, honey. Come on, I got you!\u201d He called\nout, panic made his blood run cold from the thought of not catching you; not\ncatching the one person he needed, in time. He pushed his hands out in front of\nhim, straining his arms out as far as humanly possible, readying himself for\nthe impact of your falling form. As you crashed into his arms, he let out a\ngrunt as he pulled you into his chest and barrel rolled to the floor, he let\nhis back take the full force of the floor as you impacted the ground hard. </p><p>Tony laid there for a split second, as the\ndust was kicked up around you both. \u201cFriday, how is she looking?\u201d Tony sat up, he\ngently pushed you off his chest so he could prop you up against the slab of\nconcrete beside you. With a cough, you abruptly woke, groaning at the ache that\nhad settled deep within your bones. The nanobots of Tony\u2019s suit disappeared\naround his face and exposed the worry etched into every inch of his face. You\nwatched his hands shake whilst he propped himself up on one knee and reached\nout to stroke your unprotected shoulder, through one of the many rips in your catsuit.\n</p><p>\u201cOther than clear signs of exhaustion,\n(Y/N)\u2019s vitals are steady. She will be ok, sir.\u201d Friday announced; Tony let out\na breathy laugh in relief. </p><p>\u201cThank you, Friday,\u201d you allowed him to\npet the hair out of your face, letting him look over your features, as you\nregained your strength. A burn ran down the right side of your face and neck, it\nstung at the slightest of movements. You ran your tongue across your lips,\nwincing when you ran it over the gash on your bottom lip, the metallic tang of\nblood flooded your mouth. Tony let out a sigh before placing a tender kiss to\nyour temple.</p><p>\u201cWhy the long sigh? Have we not won yet?\u201d\nYou quipped, voice raspy and war torn. Tony scoffed at your continued ability\nto sass him, even after your near experience with death. </p><p>\u201cUnfortunately for you, no, honey\u201d he tried\nnot to fuss over how broken you looked in that moment. They were still in\nbattle. \u201cCan you get back up? Or do I need to get Banner or Strange?\u201d He gripped\nyour arm swiftly after you began to stand, letting you put your weight onto him.\n</p><p>\u201cNo, Tones. I got this, don\u2019t you worry\nabout me,\u201d you winced once Tony had helped you to stand straight, you felt the\npull on the various burns and cuts that were the littered across your body; you\nignored the screams for relief from your fatigued muscles. \u201cI got some fight\nleft in me,\u201d you looked up at Tony\u2019s face, locked into his gaze as you give him\na smile, hoping it will dissipate his obvious worry. He nodded in response, taking\nyour hand in his and bringing it up to his lips tenderly. \u201cAre you ok, my love?\nWhen I saw that that\u2026 creature had you pinned, I was completely overcome with\nblind rage,\u201d you shook your head in disbelief, \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything\nlike that before, Tony. I blacked out\u201d. </p><p>Tony chuckled, much to your confusion. \u201cTony,\nwhy are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, (Y/N). Thanks to you,\u201d he\nsmiled down at you, \u201cyou never fail to me amaze me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, T-\u201c your reply was swiftly cut off by\na nearby explosion, causing you to lose your balance and you toppled into Tony,\ngrabbing at his chest to break your fall. To accommodate for the sudden extra\nweight, Tony had stumbled backwards, preparing to fall on his ass but hands to\nhis lower back and shoulder prevented his fall and pushed him upright, allowing\nyou both to stand. </p><p>\u201cWoah there, Mr Stark. I got you, I got\nyou,\u201d a hoarse voice spoke from behind him, cracking slightly at the end. Your\nears perked up, knowing who the voice belonged to, you let a smile befall your\nface. You looked at Tony expectantly and shooed him off you he checked you over.\nYou watched as he turned to the one person he had been looking forward to\nseeing again. </p><p>Tony\u2019s heart damned near stopped when he saw\nPeter standing in front of him, adorning the same suit he wore before the snap\nripped him from Tony\u2019s arms. \u201cHoly cow, Mr Stark. You would not believe-\u201c Peter\u2019s\nface was exposed as his suit fell from his face, his arms waved around in front\nof him. You watched in amusement as Tony stared at the young boy, mouth\nslightly agape as he tried to focus on Peter\u2019s story, \u201cand then I saw him do the\nyellow thingy that he does all the time\u201d. You giggled as Tony cut Peter off by harshly\npulling him into a hug, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Peter questioned, he patted Tony\u2019s\nback hesitantly. </p><p>Tony\u2019s arms were tightly wrapped around\nthe young boy\u2019s slim frame, almost suffocating him, but Peter didn\u2019t mind. \u201cHuh\u201d,\nhe whispered, \u201cthis is nice.\u201d Tony patted Peter\u2019s back firmly and hastily\nplaced a kiss on his cheek. You stepped forward as they both let out a content\nsigh, they were happy to have one another back, tears threatened to spill down\nyour cheeks as you watched their reunion. The last five years for Tony,\nalthough happy with you, were filled with tormented nightmares because of his guilt;\nhe had always blamed himself for the loss of Peter. It was nice to see them together\nagain.</p><p>You placed a gentle had on the small of Tony\u2019s\nback, demanding their attention. \u201cAs much as I hate to interrupt this moment,\nboys,\u201d Tony and Peter unravelled their arms from one another upon hearing your\nvoice, \u201cbut the battle isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d They turned to you, both had tears in\ntheir eyes and a smile on their face, like you. \u201cHi, Pete,\u201d you held your hands\nout to the young boy, letting him envelope you in a hug. </p><p>\u201cHi, (Y/N),\u201d he breathed out into your\nneck, letting you cradle the back of his head and rub his back, just like his\nmother used to. You closed your eyes and breathed in his scent; you had missed him.\n</p><p>You broke apart upon hearing T\u2019Challa\u2019s\nvoice through the comms on Peter\u2019s suit. \u201cI need back up!\u201d His voice was harsh.\nPeter whipped his hear round and spotted T\u2019Challa chasing the gauntlet across\nthe battlefield. </p><p>\u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming!\u201d He called out,\nletting the suit morph back over his suit he turned to you and Tony. He nodded\nat you before shooting a web in the direction of the battle, swinging towards\nthe gauntlet. </p><p>\u201cBe careful, Pete!\u201d You called out after\nhim, stepping forward slightly. Your voice was hoarse from worry, you prayed he\nknew what he was doing. </p><p>As if he had read your mind, Tony wrapped\nhis hand round your hip and whispered into your ear, \u201cHe\u2019ll be ok, honey. I trust\nhe knows what he is doing.\u201d He placed a soft kiss to your temple, trying to\ncomfort you the only way he knew how. You sighed into his touch. </p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d you placed your hand on\ntop of his, patting it gently. \u201cCome on, Iron Man. Lets go finish this!\u201d You\nlooked up at him with a small smile, your determination was evident on your\nface. Tony smiled back, nodding before his helmet melted back around his face. </p><p>\u201cOne last fight\u201d.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The gauntlet had laid there, out in the\nopen and ready to take. You had Thanos pinned with your thick vines, using the\nlast bit of your energy you had managed to muster when you saw him reaching for\nthe gauntlet, but he was too strong for you. He managed to rip through your\nvines with ease, reaching out to the gauntlet once more. With the help of\nadrenaline, you used your ability to manipulate air to propel you up, and you jumped\nonto the Titan\u2019s shoulders. You placed your hands on each side of his head,\nletting your body temperature rise harshly. With a guttural cry, Thanos winced\naway from the gauntlet, clawing at you to cease your actions. You felt the skin\nbeneath your fingers begin to burn, you clutched onto that feeling as\nmotivation to continue, in the hopes it would kill the titan. With a force of\nhis hand, Thanos was able to grab you by the neck and pull you off his\nshoulders, he held you out in front of him, letting your body dangle from his\nhand. \u201cYou lost, little Stark,\u201d he chuckled as his grip on your neck tightened.\n</p><p>You felt your body spasm under his grip,\nyou thrashed around his hand desperately gasping for air as he continued to squeeze\nthe life out of you. You felt the coldness of dread spread through your veins\nas you watched the smirk on the Titan\u2019s face grow. Your face was surely a sight\nto behold; red, veins bulging from your forehead and your mouth hung open like\na fish out of water. Instead, he walked forward, towards the gauntlet. You clawed\nat his hand in a desperate attempt to stop him, hoping he would relent his vice\ngrip on your neck, but he didn\u2019t even wince at your efforts. Your lungs burned\nand your vision blurred because of your oxygen starved brain, you could only\nhopelessly watch him win once again; he slipped his spare hand into the gauntlet\nand raised it in the air. Thanos looked into your eyes, tears fell down your\ncheeks as you realised this would be the last thing you saw before you die. </p><p>You were never going to see Tony again,\nyou were never going to wake up in his arms, you were never going to start that\nfamily you wanted to after the snap. You would never hear him tell you just how\nmuch he loved you. You weren\u2019t going to come back to him. </p><p>Thanos brought his fingers together,\nchuckled at your tears and spoke with triumph, \u201cI am inevitable!\u201d</p><p>Snap. </p><p>You fell to the ground, hard. Your chest\nheaved as you retched for air, your eyes squeezed shut in fear of seeing those\nyou love disappear once again. You thought it was the end. </p><p>\u201cWha-\u201c the disbelief in Thanos\u2019 voice forced\nyour eyes open. You looked up and watched him investigate the gauntlet. As he\nrotated his hand around, you saw the stones were missing, leaving you equally\nconfused. However, a bright light accompanied by the gasp of your husband behind\nyou brought both yours and Thanos\u2019 attention away from the gauntlet. Upon turning\naround, you wished you had never let Tony get involved with any of this. There he\nwas, Tony, donning the stones in his suit. You watched the power of the stones\nwreak havoc on his body, electrifying his arm and you knew he would be left\nwith burns, and worse, he would die. \u201cTony, no!\u201d Your voice was strangled, you\ncrawled towards him in a desperate bid to stop him, your sight blurred by the tears\nthat had gathered in your eyes. </p><p>He smiled adoringly at you, \u201cI love you\ntons, honey\u201d he croaked out, the power of the stones was truly too much for his\nbody. You continued to crawl forward at an agonisingly slow pace, screaming out\nfor him to stop; your throat ripped raw from your crying. Tony looked past you,\ntowards Thanos, his face was defiant. He had won. </p><p>\u201cI\u2026 Am\u2026 Iron Man!\u201d</p><p>Snap.</p><p>\u201cTony! No!\u201d You lunged forward at the last\nsecond, grabbing hold of his wrist as he snapped. You felt the power of the\nstones ricochet through your body, letting the blinding light of the snap\nswallow you whole with Tony. </p><hr><p>Ash rained down across the battlefield. The Chitauri,\nThanos and his children were all annihilated from the snap, their remains\ncoating those who survived the battle. </p><p>You ignored the cheers of the others, scrambling\ntowards Tony\u2019s body. He was propped up against the broken metal structure of\none of headquarters remaining walls, his right arm and side of his head was severely\nburned and irreparable. You cried out, hands hovering over his injuries as you\nscreamed out for help. Your face was soaked by your own tears as you watched\nthe life fade from the only person you have loved. </p><p>You placed a trembling hand on the uninjured side\nof Tony\u2019s face, stroking his cheek gently. \u201cYou\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok, you\u2019re ok. Tony,\nbaby, I love you, ok? I love you tons. You\u2019re ok.\u201d Between every syllable, you\nplaced soft kisses on his cheek, forehead, nose, lips, chin and any other unburnt\npart of his face. Peter dropped to his knees by your side, his body shaking\nwith his own sobs. </p><p>\u201cYou did it, Mr. Stark! You did it\u2026 Tony, I\u2019m\nsorry!\u201d </p><p>You lost all sense of sanity, letting yourself\nhunch over Tony\u2019s dying form as you sobbed into his flickering arc reactor. <i>Come back to me.</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You stroll down the hallway of your beloved cabin. You\neyes scan the numerous pictures that litter the walls: you and Tony on your\nfirst day as an Avenger; you and the Avengers eating out at Schwarmas; you and\nTony on your 1<sup>st</sup> anniversary; Tony and you shortly after he had\nproposed to you, and you both on your wedding day. Happy memories. It\u2019s been 6\nmonths post-second snap and you quickly retreated to the cabin you had made\nyour home after the first snap occurred. </p><p>You smile at the fond memories that are scattered amongst\nthe wall, letting a small huff of air pass your lips. </p><p>\u201cThat better not have been a sigh, Mrs. Stark!\u201d </p><p>You giggle, shaking your head as you turn around to\ngreet your beloved husband. Thanks to Strange, his determination and magic, your\nbeloved Tony would not be standing in front of you right now. The right side to\nhis head is heavily scarred, but with the help of Bruce recently, it has been\nhealing nicely and with a few more sessions, hopefully his skin will regenerate\nas normal. His arm? Gone with the snap, Strange had to amputate it to save his\nlife. You look over his new prosthetic, an arm slightly similar to Bucky\u2019s; but\nwith Tony\u2019s eccentricity its not surprising that it\u2019s the same colour palette\nas Iron Man himself, because <i>we gotta represent,\n(Y/N)</i>. </p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t a sigh, Tones. Just allowing myself to feel\nnostalgic about some old memories,\u201d you walk towards him with a beaming smile,\nallowing him to envelope you in a strong hug. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmhm,\u201d you affirm, pulling away from his hug. He\nplaces a hand on your stomach, looking down at your growing belly. </p><p>\u201cCan you believe that in the next three months, we\u2019ll\nbe able to tell our little Morgan all about those memories that hang on the\nwalls?\u201d He rubs your stomach in circular motions. </p><p>You smile down at your bump, placing your hand on top\nof Tony\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m more excited at the memories we\u2019re gonna make with little\nMorgan,\u201d you look back up at your husband, catching his adoring look, \u201cyou\u2019re\ngoing to be the best father, I know it\u201d. </p><p>He places a gentle kiss on your lips, leaning his\nforehead against yours, a beaming smile on his face, \u201cand you\u2019re going to be an\nincredible mother, (Y/N).\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Tones,\u201d you whisper against his lips, \u201cthank\nyou for coming back to me\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAlways, (Y/N),\u201d he presses another gentle kiss to\nyour lips as his hand continues to stroke your stomach soothingly, \u201cI love you\u2026\n3000\u201d. You scoff at him as he sniggers, he tickles your sides as you push away\nfrom him. </p><p>Your moment is interrupted by a flushed Peter, who barrels\nhis way through the side door of the cabin, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here, Tony!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAwesome, thanks kid! Let\u2019s go greet our guests,\nshall we Mrs Stark?\u201d He looks to you, enclosing your hand with his as he\nintertwines your fingers together. You nod, turning to smile at Pete, holding\nout your other hand for him to take. He does with a giddy smile, following you\nand Tony out the door to greet your guests. </p><p>The back lawn is littered with those who had fought\nby your side, six months ago. Your heart swells at the sight of everyone talking\nand laughing amongst themselves, at your home. Peace has been restored and\neveryone is happy. You feel Tony\u2019s hand on your stomach once more as you\ncontinue to watch your extended family, your smile so wide your cheeks ache,\nbut you can\u2019t find it in yourself to care because everything was perfect. You really\nhave won. </p><hr><p>A/N: I hope you liked it! I wrote this in like 2\nhours after downing a couple cups of coffee, so I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s jumpy in a\nfew places or has any raging errors!! I\u2019m aware the ending is quite rushed but I hope you guys can look past that, haha oops!

Five long years, the time\nheist, the stones and Stark&rsquo;s gauntlet. It all led to the final fight.</p><p>You took a stand next to Tony, intertwining\nyour fingers with his, as you watched an endless number of portals appear across\nthe decimation of Thanos&rsquo; attack on the Avengers headquarters. Heroes and warriors\nalike ascended through the newly formed openings, chanting and cheering, as\nthey readied themselves for the fight. </p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch, Ratchet. It really did\nwork!&rdquo; Tony had let out a small chuckle, the possibility of winning the war\nbecame extremely apparent in that moment and restored the little hope he had left\nafter five long years of living on a broken planet. </p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, if this wasn&rsquo;t such a beautiful moment,\nI&rsquo;d rip that canned suit off y&rsquo;body and shove your little nanobots up your ass!&rdquo;\nRocket sneered, climbing up onto Rhodey&rsquo;s shoulder. He cocked his gun as Rhodey\nfell in line with Tony. </p><p>Tony smirked, eyes searching the sea of\nheroes that continued to funnel through the portals. Sam, Strange, Bucky, Quill,\nPepper&hellip; Peter. Tony&rsquo;s hand gripped onto yours, the heat of your touch radiated\nthrough the armour of his suit and brought comfort. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ok, (Y/N),&rdquo; you\nturned to him as the helmet of his suit melted away from his face and exposed\nhis gleeful expression, &ldquo;the kid&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ok, Tones,&rdquo; You replied softly,\nbasking in his newfound joy. You smiled fondly at your husband. </p><p>Tony turned to you as everyone fell in line\nbehind you, he ran his other hand down your arm, which caused you to turn to\nhim. &ldquo;I love you tons,&rdquo; he spoke up, barely audible over the army that was\nstill falling in line behind you; Tony clung onto the opportunity to talk to\nyou before this fight, just in case. &ldquo;For the love of god be careful, honey.\nWatch your back and please,&rdquo; he stared into your (y/e/c) eyes, memorising every\ntiny detail of your beautiful, clear irises, as if it was the last time he was\ngoing to see you. He worried his lip between his teeth before he let out a\nsmall huff, &ldquo;come back to me after we win&rdquo;. </p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; you pressed a searing but hurried\nkiss to his lips, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always return to you, my love,&rdquo; your smile grew as you\nlocked into Tony&rsquo;s longing gaze. He leaned in for another kiss, but you quickly\nplaced a hand to his armoured chest, halting him. &ldquo;Ah ah ah, not so fast, Mr\nStark,&rdquo; your smile turned into a lopsided smirk, &ldquo;that kiss is reserved for my\nhusband after we win this fight&hellip; so make sure you come back to me&rdquo;. </p><p>Tony scoffed, accompanied with a playful\neye roll and a matching smirk to yours. His helmet melted back around his head,\n&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way, honey&rdquo;. He turned towards Thanos&rsquo; army, readying\nhimself for the fight ahead of him. Being a mutant who can manipulate the elements:\nearth; fire; wind and water, you used your abilities to push yourself off the\nbattlefield&rsquo;s floor and into the air alongside Wanda. You took one last look at\nTony, who had taken his own battle stance next between Rhodes and Steve. You admired\nhis determination to continue the fight, and his will to win. Praying to Odin\nthat you would be able to hold him when this all over, you used your wishes to\nenjoy the rest of your life and marriage with Tony to motivate you to win the\nfight. </p><p>&ldquo;Avengers,&rdquo; Steve demanded the attention\nof the army that stood behind him, his voice echoed across the battlefield as\nhe stretched his arm out in front of him, calling for Mjolnir. Silence creeped across\nthe battlefield, with only the faint cheers of Thanos&rsquo; children and the growls\nof the chitauri filling the void, as they rushed towards the heroes. You sucked\nin a breath, waiting for your orders. T&rsquo;Challa raised his claws in the form of\nan &lsquo;X&rsquo; across his chest, the Wakandan Army followed suit by readying their weapons\nin a synchronised dance. Pepper, Hope and Wanda were practically glowing with\npower beside you. You allowed the volcanic heat of magma engulf your body, your\narms were alight and aglow with flames, and you were ready to rain hellfire onto\nthe enemy. You were ready to burn through the armour of the purple titan himself.\nGuns were cocked and after what seemed like an eternal pause, Mjolnir flew into\nSteve&rsquo;s hand and he twisted his body forward as he cried out, &ldquo;Assemble!&rdquo;</p><p>You followed behind Tony and Steve as the\narmy surged forward with a ferocious battle cry. Years of repent, mourning and\nanger propelled you all forward and into the fight with determination to destroy\nThanos, his children and the rest of his army, to protect the gauntlet. You\ncommandeered the sky with Rhodes, Wanda, Pepper and Tony whilst Steve, Bucky\nand Banner commanded the Army below. The clash hit both sides hard, Chitauri\nand human blood painted the battlefield and those who fought upon it, almost\ninstantly. </p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>The battle was like an orchestrated dance\nand the main attraction was the gauntlet. As you fought by Thor&rsquo;s side, you\ntold Wanda to follow Clint across the battlefield, to ensure the safety of both\nhim and the gauntlet. A vortex of wind, water and lightning swallowed both you\nand Thor and wreaked havoc on the Chitauri army. You were an impenetrable\nforce, the forces of nature came together around you and ripped anyone who came\ninto contact with you into pieces. Your fireballs decimated countless Chitauri\nsoldiers and those that dodged them were either ripped apart by the vines you\nhad conjured from the earth or the lightning bolts that were rippling from Thor&rsquo;s\naxe. There were no survivors. </p><p>The crackling of your comms coaxed you\naway from the fight. The sound of Tony&rsquo;s pained grunts split through your\nthoughts and you turned your back to Thor, frantically searching for your husband.\nTo your left, up on the broken structure of what was left of the headquarters\nyou were fighting on, was Tony. He was suffering at the hands of Ebony Maw, pinned\ndown by the remains of the HQ&rsquo;S structural metal beams, his armoured body was\nslowly being crushed and whilst the nanobots were hastily forming around his\nchest to prevent his death, the power of Ebony Maw was becoming too much for\nthe suit to handle. Tony was going to be killed. </p><p>You broke into a run towards Tony.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Come back to me.</i></p><p>His words echoed in\nyour mind as you allowed the murderous rage that was bubbling in your chest consume\nyour entire body. You furiously clenched your fists as you let every inch of\nyour body be devoured by an intense white flame, radiating the heat of a\nsupernova. With a gut-wrenching scream, you propelled yourself into the sky, instantly\nripping apart any enemy in your path. You locked onto Ebony Maw and you dived\nfrom the sky, allowing the flames that engulfed to intensify with your rage.\nYou impacted the child of Thanos with the power of an atom bomb, obliterating\nhim; you used the skeletal remains as a battering ram to destroy a Leviathan\nabove them. </p><p>The metal beams fell away from Tony&rsquo;s body\nand he fell to the floor with a gasp, immediately looking up to follow your\nmovements. The repulsors of his suit boosted him into the air, towards your\nfalling form. Burned and limp, your body fell towards the middle of the battlefield.\nTony willed his suit to go faster, determined to catch his wife before she\nmakes impact with the floor, &ldquo;I got you, honey. Come on, I got you!&rdquo; He called\nout, panic made his blood run cold from the thought of not catching you; not\ncatching the one person he needed, in time. He pushed his hands out in front of\nhim, straining his arms out as far as humanly possible, readying himself for\nthe impact of your falling form. As you crashed into his arms, he let out a\ngrunt as he pulled you into his chest and barrel rolled to the floor, he let\nhis back take the full force of the floor as you impacted the ground hard. </p><p>Tony laid there for a split second, as the\ndust was kicked up around you both. &ldquo;Friday, how is she looking?&rdquo; Tony sat up, he\ngently pushed you off his chest so he could prop you up against the slab of\nconcrete beside you. With a cough, you abruptly woke, groaning at the ache that\nhad settled deep within your bones. The nanobots of Tony&rsquo;s suit disappeared\naround his face and exposed the worry etched into every inch of his face. You\nwatched his hands shake whilst he propped himself up on one knee and reached\nout to stroke your unprotected shoulder, through one of the many rips in your catsuit.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Other than clear signs of exhaustion,\n(Y/N)&rsquo;s vitals are steady. She will be ok, sir.&rdquo; Friday announced; Tony let out\na breathy laugh in relief. </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Friday,&rdquo; you allowed him to\npet the hair out of your face, letting him look over your features, as you\nregained your strength. A burn ran down the right side of your face and neck, it\nstung at the slightest of movements. You ran your tongue across your lips,\nwincing when you ran it over the gash on your bottom lip, the metallic tang of\nblood flooded your mouth. Tony let out a sigh before placing a tender kiss to\nyour temple.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the long sigh? Have we not won yet?&rdquo;\nYou quipped, voice raspy and war torn. Tony scoffed at your continued ability\nto sass him, even after your near experience with death. </p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately for you, no, honey&rdquo; he tried\nnot to fuss over how broken you looked in that moment. They were still in\nbattle. &ldquo;Can you get back up? Or do I need to get Banner or Strange?&rdquo; He gripped\nyour arm swiftly after you began to stand, letting you put your weight onto him.\n</p><p>&ldquo;No, Tones. I got this, don&rsquo;t you worry\nabout me,&rdquo; you winced once Tony had helped you to stand straight, you felt the\npull on the various burns and cuts that were the littered across your body; you\nignored the screams for relief from your fatigued muscles. &ldquo;I got some fight\nleft in me,&rdquo; you looked up at Tony&rsquo;s face, locked into his gaze as you give him\na smile, hoping it will dissipate his obvious worry. He nodded in response, taking\nyour hand in his and bringing it up to his lips tenderly. &ldquo;Are you ok, my love?\nWhen I saw that that&hellip; creature had you pinned, I was completely overcome with\nblind rage,&rdquo; you shook your head in disbelief, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never experienced anything\nlike that before, Tony. I blacked out&rdquo;. </p><p>Tony chuckled, much to your confusion. &ldquo;Tony,\nwhy are you laughing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just fine, (Y/N). Thanks to you,&rdquo; he\nsmiled down at you, &ldquo;you never fail to me amaze me, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, T-&ldquo; your reply was swiftly cut off by\na nearby explosion, causing you to lose your balance and you toppled into Tony,\ngrabbing at his chest to break your fall. To accommodate for the sudden extra\nweight, Tony had stumbled backwards, preparing to fall on his ass but hands to\nhis lower back and shoulder prevented his fall and pushed him upright, allowing\nyou both to stand. </p><p>&ldquo;Woah there, Mr Stark. I got you, I got\nyou,&rdquo; a hoarse voice spoke from behind him, cracking slightly at the end. Your\nears perked up, knowing who the voice belonged to, you let a smile befall your\nface. You looked at Tony expectantly and shooed him off you he checked you over.\nYou watched as he turned to the one person he had been looking forward to\nseeing again. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s heart damned near stopped when he saw\nPeter standing in front of him, adorning the same suit he wore before the snap\nripped him from Tony&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Holy cow, Mr Stark. You would not believe-&ldquo; Peter&rsquo;s\nface was exposed as his suit fell from his face, his arms waved around in front\nof him. You watched in amusement as Tony stared at the young boy, mouth\nslightly agape as he tried to focus on Peter&rsquo;s story, &ldquo;and then I saw him do the\nyellow thingy that he does all the time&rdquo;. You giggled as Tony cut Peter off by harshly\npulling him into a hug, &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; Peter questioned, he patted Tony&rsquo;s\nback hesitantly. </p><p>Tony&rsquo;s arms were tightly wrapped around\nthe young boy&rsquo;s slim frame, almost suffocating him, but Peter didn&rsquo;t mind. &ldquo;Huh&rdquo;,\nhe whispered, &ldquo;this is nice.&rdquo; Tony patted Peter&rsquo;s back firmly and hastily\nplaced a kiss on his cheek. You stepped forward as they both let out a content\nsigh, they were happy to have one another back, tears threatened to spill down\nyour cheeks as you watched their reunion. The last five years for Tony,\nalthough happy with you, were filled with tormented nightmares because of his guilt;\nhe had always blamed himself for the loss of Peter. It was nice to see them together\nagain.</p><p>You placed a gentle had on the small of Tony&rsquo;s\nback, demanding their attention. &ldquo;As much as I hate to interrupt this moment,\nboys,&rdquo; Tony and Peter unravelled their arms from one another upon hearing your\nvoice, &ldquo;but the battle isn&rsquo;t over yet.&rdquo; They turned to you, both had tears in\ntheir eyes and a smile on their face, like you. &ldquo;Hi, Pete,&rdquo; you held your hands\nout to the young boy, letting him envelope you in a hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Hi, (Y/N),&rdquo; he breathed out into your\nneck, letting you cradle the back of his head and rub his back, just like his\nmother used to. You closed your eyes and breathed in his scent; you had missed him.\n</p><p>You broke apart upon hearing T&rsquo;Challa&rsquo;s\nvoice through the comms on Peter&rsquo;s suit. &ldquo;I need back up!&rdquo; His voice was harsh.\nPeter whipped his hear round and spotted T&rsquo;Challa chasing the gauntlet across\nthe battlefield. </p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; He called out,\nletting the suit morph back over his suit he turned to you and Tony. He nodded\nat you before shooting a web in the direction of the battle, swinging towards\nthe gauntlet. </p><p>&ldquo;Be careful, Pete!&rdquo; You called out after\nhim, stepping forward slightly. Your voice was hoarse from worry, you prayed he\nknew what he was doing. </p><p>As if he had read your mind, Tony wrapped\nhis hand round your hip and whispered into your ear, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be ok, honey. I trust\nhe knows what he is doing.&rdquo; He placed a soft kiss to your temple, trying to\ncomfort you the only way he knew how. You sighed into his touch. </p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; you placed your hand on\ntop of his, patting it gently. &ldquo;Come on, Iron Man. Lets go finish this!&rdquo; You\nlooked up at him with a small smile, your determination was evident on your\nface. Tony smiled back, nodding before his helmet melted back around his face. </p><p>&ldquo;One last fight&rdquo;.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>The gauntlet had laid there, out in the\nopen and ready to take. You had Thanos pinned with your thick vines, using the\nlast bit of your energy you had managed to muster when you saw him reaching for\nthe gauntlet, but he was too strong for you. He managed to rip through your\nvines with ease, reaching out to the gauntlet once more. With the help of\nadrenaline, you used your ability to manipulate air to propel you up, and you jumped\nonto the Titan&rsquo;s shoulders. You placed your hands on each side of his head,\nletting your body temperature rise harshly. With a guttural cry, Thanos winced\naway from the gauntlet, clawing at you to cease your actions. You felt the skin\nbeneath your fingers begin to burn, you clutched onto that feeling as\nmotivation to continue, in the hopes it would kill the titan. With a force of\nhis hand, Thanos was able to grab you by the neck and pull you off his\nshoulders, he held you out in front of him, letting your body dangle from his\nhand. &ldquo;You lost, little Stark,&rdquo; he chuckled as his grip on your neck tightened.\n</p><p>You felt your body spasm under his grip,\nyou thrashed around his hand desperately gasping for air as he continued to squeeze\nthe life out of you. You felt the coldness of dread spread through your veins\nas you watched the smirk on the Titan&rsquo;s face grow. Your face was surely a sight\nto behold; red, veins bulging from your forehead and your mouth hung open like\na fish out of water. Instead, he walked forward, towards the gauntlet. You clawed\nat his hand in a desperate attempt to stop him, hoping he would relent his vice\ngrip on your neck, but he didn&rsquo;t even wince at your efforts. Your lungs burned\nand your vision blurred because of your oxygen starved brain, you could only\nhopelessly watch him win once again; he slipped his spare hand into the gauntlet\nand raised it in the air. Thanos looked into your eyes, tears fell down your\ncheeks as you realised this would be the last thing you saw before you die. </p><p>You were never going to see Tony again,\nyou were never going to wake up in his arms, you were never going to start that\nfamily you wanted to after the snap. You would never hear him tell you just how\nmuch he loved you. You weren&rsquo;t going to come back to him. </p><p>Thanos brought his fingers together,\nchuckled at your tears and spoke with triumph, &ldquo;I am inevitable!&rdquo;</p><p>Snap. </p><p>You fell to the ground, hard. Your chest\nheaved as you retched for air, your eyes squeezed shut in fear of seeing those\nyou love disappear once again. You thought it was the end. </p><p>&ldquo;Wha-&ldquo; the disbelief in Thanos&rsquo; voice forced\nyour eyes open. You looked up and watched him investigate the gauntlet. As he\nrotated his hand around, you saw the stones were missing, leaving you equally\nconfused. However, a bright light accompanied by the gasp of your husband behind\nyou brought both yours and Thanos&rsquo; attention away from the gauntlet. Upon turning\naround, you wished you had never let Tony get involved with any of this. There he\nwas, Tony, donning the stones in his suit. You watched the power of the stones\nwreak havoc on his body, electrifying his arm and you knew he would be left\nwith burns, and worse, he would die. &ldquo;Tony, no!&rdquo; Your voice was strangled, you\ncrawled towards him in a desperate bid to stop him, your sight blurred by the tears\nthat had gathered in your eyes. </p><p>He smiled adoringly at you, &ldquo;I love you\ntons, honey&rdquo; he croaked out, the power of the stones was truly too much for his\nbody. You continued to crawl forward at an agonisingly slow pace, screaming out\nfor him to stop; your throat ripped raw from your crying. Tony looked past you,\ntowards Thanos, his face was defiant. He had won. </p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; Am&hellip; Iron Man!&rdquo;</p><p>Snap.</p><p>&ldquo;Tony! No!&rdquo; You lunged forward at the last\nsecond, grabbing hold of his wrist as he snapped. You felt the power of the\nstones ricochet through your body, letting the blinding light of the snap\nswallow you whole with Tony. </p><hr /><p>Ash rained down across the battlefield. The Chitauri,\nThanos and his children were all annihilated from the snap, their remains\ncoating those who survived the battle. </p><p>You ignored the cheers of the others, scrambling\ntowards Tony&rsquo;s body. He was propped up against the broken metal structure of\none of headquarters remaining walls, his right arm and side of his head was severely\nburned and irreparable. You cried out, hands hovering over his injuries as you\nscreamed out for help. Your face was soaked by your own tears as you watched\nthe life fade from the only person you have loved. </p><p>You placed a trembling hand on the uninjured side\nof Tony&rsquo;s face, stroking his cheek gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ok, you&rsquo;re ok, you&rsquo;re ok. Tony,\nbaby, I love you, ok? I love you tons. You&rsquo;re ok.&rdquo; Between every syllable, you\nplaced soft kisses on his cheek, forehead, nose, lips, chin and any other unburnt\npart of his face. Peter dropped to his knees by your side, his body shaking\nwith his own sobs. </p><p>&ldquo;You did it, Mr. Stark! You did it&hellip; Tony, I&rsquo;m\nsorry!&rdquo; </p><p>You lost all sense of sanity, letting yourself\nhunch over Tony&rsquo;s dying form as you sobbed into his flickering arc reactor. <i>Come back to me.</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>You stroll down the hallway of your beloved cabin. You\neyes scan the numerous pictures that litter the walls: you and Tony on your\nfirst day as an Avenger; you and the Avengers eating out at Schwarmas; you and\nTony on your 1<sup>st</sup> anniversary; Tony and you shortly after he had\nproposed to you, and you both on your wedding day. Happy memories. It&rsquo;s been 6\nmonths post-second snap and you quickly retreated to the cabin you had made\nyour home after the first snap occurred. </p><p>You smile at the fond memories that are scattered amongst\nthe wall, letting a small huff of air pass your lips. </p><p>&ldquo;That better not have been a sigh, Mrs. Stark!&rdquo; </p><p>You giggle, shaking your head as you turn around to\ngreet your beloved husband. Thanks to Strange, his determination and magic, your\nbeloved Tony would not be standing in front of you right now. The right side to\nhis head is heavily scarred, but with the help of Bruce recently, it has been\nhealing nicely and with a few more sessions, hopefully his skin will regenerate\nas normal. His arm? Gone with the snap, Strange had to amputate it to save his\nlife. You look over his new prosthetic, an arm slightly similar to Bucky&rsquo;s; but\nwith Tony&rsquo;s eccentricity its not surprising that it&rsquo;s the same colour palette\nas Iron Man himself, because <i>we gotta represent,\n(Y/N)</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t a sigh, Tones. Just allowing myself to feel\nnostalgic about some old memories,&rdquo; you walk towards him with a beaming smile,\nallowing him to envelope you in a strong hug. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmhm,&rdquo; you affirm, pulling away from his hug. He\nplaces a hand on your stomach, looking down at your growing belly. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you believe that in the next three months, we&rsquo;ll\nbe able to tell our little Morgan all about those memories that hang on the\nwalls?&rdquo; He rubs your stomach in circular motions. </p><p>You smile down at your bump, placing your hand on top\nof Tony&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more excited at the memories we&rsquo;re gonna make with little\nMorgan,&rdquo; you look back up at your husband, catching his adoring look, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re\ngoing to be the best father, I know it&rdquo;. </p><p>He places a gentle kiss on your lips, leaning his\nforehead against yours, a beaming smile on his face, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re going to be an\nincredible mother, (Y/N).&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Tones,&rdquo; you whisper against his lips, &ldquo;thank\nyou for coming back to me&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Always, (Y/N),&rdquo; he presses another gentle kiss to\nyour lips as his hand continues to stroke your stomach soothingly, &ldquo;I love you&hellip;\n3000&rdquo;. You scoff at him as he sniggers, he tickles your sides as you push away\nfrom him. </p><p>Your moment is interrupted by a flushed Peter, who barrels\nhis way through the side door of the cabin, &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s here, Tony!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Awesome, thanks kid! Let&rsquo;s go greet our guests,\nshall we Mrs Stark?&rdquo; He looks to you, enclosing your hand with his as he\nintertwines your fingers together. You nod, turning to smile at Pete, holding\nout your other hand for him to take. He does with a giddy smile, following you\nand Tony out the door to greet your guests. </p><p>The back lawn is littered with those who had fought\nby your side, six months ago. Your heart swells at the sight of everyone talking\nand laughing amongst themselves, at your home. Peace has been restored and\neveryone is happy. You feel Tony&rsquo;s hand on your stomach once more as you\ncontinue to watch your extended family, your smile so wide your cheeks ache,\nbut you can&rsquo;t find it in yourself to care because everything was perfect. You really\nhave won. </p><hr /><p>A/N: I hope you liked it!
