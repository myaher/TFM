        "question": "What I find so frustrating about Jon is that he never seems to learn his lesson about poor communication. It happened with tragic consequences in the NW, and it happens again in s7. He was so offended that Sansa publicly disagreed with him, and I get that it's because of his own insecurity and he felt undermined, but it never occurs to him that she wouldn't have HAD to if he'd discussed it with her beforehand and given her an opportunity to express her concerns privately. Will he ever learn?",
        "answer": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p><i>First of all, I\u2019d like to apologize for taking this long to answer. You guys have been sending me a lot of asks, which I love, so it\u2019s taking me quite some time to go through all of them. On a general note, I sometimes prioritize answering asks that come as reactions to one of my posts or that are related to newly released info/promo/photos because I feel that letting those asks sit in my inbox for too long kind of defeats the purpose of them. Which means I don\u2019t always go in a chronological order when answering questions. So if you see that I haven\u2019t answered your ask, please don\u2019t get discouraged. It\u2019s very likely that it\u2019s sitting there waiting for me to find time to give an in-depth answer.\u00a0</i></p><p>Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s do this, nonnie!</p><p>Btw, love the sheer exasperation coming off of your post. What woman hasn\u2019t asked the\u00a0\u201cWill he ever learn\u201d question at least once in their lives. Men are from Mars and women are from Venus, indeed. :)))</p><p>I actually thought that this would be a good time for me to talk a bit more broadly about what I think Jon\u2019s major two flaws/issues are at the moment and why I feel it\u2019s important for him to overcome them, particularly in the likelihood of him becoming king at the end of season 8.\u00a0</p><p><b>The first one, as you already pointed out in your ask, is poor communication or, even more generally, his tendency to act as a lone wolf.\u00a0</b></p><p>This is a bit of a pickle for me because it\u2019s one aspect, I feel, where book Jon differs from show Jon. I think book Jon displays lone wolf characteristics prior to his death. He essentially cuts himself off from his Night Watch brothers, sends Sam to Old Town and seems to take to heart Ned\u2019s mindset of what being a leader is, which is to say that you can love your men but you cannot be their friend. Book Jon applies that to his Night Watch command and it\u2019s in part the reason why he ends up being killed. He just becomes isolated and alone which in turn makes him vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Show Jon, I feel, doesn\u2019t do that. Sam leaves for Old Town because he wants to go, despite Jon\u2019s apprehensions and desire that he stay. He explains again and again the importance of the alliance with the Wildlings to his men and takes Ed with him to Hardhome. In private, he attempts to make Ollie see his reasons for making this decision. So I wouldn\u2019t say that poor communication is what gets show Jon killed.\u00a0</p><p>What gets show Jon killed is Allister Thorne, essentially. For one, there is a strong personal animosity there that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. For two, I genuinely believe that Allister Throne is committed to the Night\u2019s Watch and sees Jon as a dangerous element that needs to be stopped. So he gets his allies together and they plot against him. I don\u2019t think the rest of the group is really as personally invested in the assassination as Thorne is, they\u2019re simply his followers.\u00a0</p><p>The one glaring exception is Ollie whose motivations for killing Jon are deeply personal and, perhaps, from all of them, the one that is most understandable. He sees what Jon is doing as a personal betrayal and he is essentially taking revenge. It\u2019s interesting to note that Ollie\u2019s actions are the ones that hurt Jon the most and the first thing he remembers when he comes back from the dead. In many ways, I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s over Ollie killing him or that he had to execute him for it.\u00a0</p><p>Also important to mention here is that post-assassination, Allister and his group do not receive the support they were perhaps expecting. Ed and a few men loyal to Jon go as far as to oppose them outright and the rest of the Night\u2019s Watch accept what happened because there is seemingly nothing to be done. Which is why when the Wildlings storm Castle Black, most of the Night\u2019s Watch isn\u2019t exactly chopping at the bit to protect Throne and his knife wielders.\u00a0</p><p>The reason why I say all this is because I feel like Jon\u2019s lone wolf tendencies are very much a product of his resurrection and the betrayal he suffered through at the hands of men that called themselves his brothers. He\u2019s naturally a man that values collaboration and communication, over imposing his will unilaterally.\u00a0</p><p>So in that sense, I do think in time he will get back there and be more open to communicating and debating his decisions. His communication issues are very much like Sansa\u2019s trust issues. They\u2019ve both suffered traumas and had their confidence in people abused and shaken, so they\u2019re both reluctant to opening up fully. Also it\u2019s important to note that once it becomes clear to him that Sansa feels excluded and wants her opinion heard, he adjusts and asks her opinion when it comes to Tyrion. So he is trying. That\u2019s something. :)</p><p>There\u2019s also a point to be made to what I believe are the differences between the two instances where Jon blindsides Sansa with his decisions, because I don\u2019t think his motivation or intentions were the same in both of them.\u00a0</p><p>In the undermine me scene, I don\u2019t think it occurs to Jon that Sansa would disagree with his decision to pardon Alys Karstark and Ned Umber. In his mind he is making the decision his father would have made (I\u2019m not sure Ned would have done that but Jon tends to idealize him to a degree) so he thinks Sansa will have the same view on the subject as he does. In that sense, I think he\u2019s genuinely surprised that Sansa disagrees with it. He decides to focus on the\u00a0\u201cundermining\u201d aspect of her disagreement but I think in many respects that\u2019s him deflecting what it truly bothering him which is that he feels Sansa doesn\u2019t trust him enough to have faith in his decisions and that she would be so adamant to punish two young children.\u00a0</p><p>So his reaction to her challenging him is very personal and is a sign of deep vulnerability when it comes to her that he\u2019s trying (not very well) to hide under some sort of political savvy pretense.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the scene where he announces to the Great Council that he has decided to go to Dragonstone. Sansa is naturally shocked by this because they\u2019ve already discussed the subject and both her and Davos tell him not to go.\u00a0</p><p>The interesting thing about this scene is that Jon isn\u2019t surprised by her reaction this time. He looks as if he\u2019s expecting it actually. On top of that, Davos is surprised as well which means he didn\u2019t discuss it with him either.\u00a0</p><p>What that tells me is that the reason why he doesn\u2019t talk to Sansa beforehand is not a matter of poor communication in this instance but rather that he chooses not to tell her. The question is: why?\u00a0</p><p>Jonsa fans have theorized that Jon finds it hard to be alone with Sansa because of his personal feelings for her. That may very well be part of the reason for it but, more importantly, I think he doesn\u2019t talk to her beforehand because he doesn\u2019t want to be talked out of leaving.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s put it this way: Jon Snow is not an idiot. He knows going to Dragonstone is dangerous and risky. He knows that he might get killed or captured. He knows all of the things that Sansa tells him during the Council. But he still feels like he has to go because he needs men and dragonglass and dragons. So he avoids the council of Davos and Sansa, in particular, because he doesn\u2019t want to hear the reasons why he shouldn\u2019t go, he doesn\u2019t want to think of the risk he\u2019s placing Sansa in by leaving her alone and he tries, instead, to convince himself that all will work out well.\u00a0</p><p>Which brings us to Jon\u2019s second major issue and one that, unlike his poor communication skills that need some adjustment but are not, in my view, catastrophic in the grand scheme of things (we all have flaws, after all), jeopardizes him and those he loves time and time again. And one that he really needs to get a handle on if he is ever to be a successful king:\u00a0</p><p><b>His\u00a0\u201c1st ranger\u201d mindset:\u00a0</b></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Then send an emissary. Don\u2019t go yourself!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Jon: The Free Folk will help us.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Davos: They won\u2019t follow Ser Jorah.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: They won\u2019t have to.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Time and time again we\u2019ve seen Jon put himself at great risk and offer himself up for dangerous, almost suicidal missions. In theory, all of this has the makings of a hero which is great but, as D*ny puts it, heroes don\u2019t tend to live very long because they end up doing stupid things.\u00a0</p><p>In order to understand where this issues comes from, we need to look back to what Jon first stated he had ever wanted, which was to be a ranger in the Night\u2019s Watch and, in time, 1st ranger like his uncle Benjen.</p><p>While all the men of the Night\u2019s Watch are expected to bare arms in the case of an attack, the rangers are the real soldiers of the order. So in essence what Jon always wanted to be was a warrior.\u00a0</p><p>Which is great, except that as early as season 1 he\u2019s been constantly derailed from that desire. He wanted to be a ranger but became Joer Mormont\u2019s stewart instead, something he felt was a punishment. It took Sam to point out that the Lord Commander asking for him personally meant that Jon was being prepared for command. But that didn\u2019t seem to make Jon all that happy because and I quote:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Jon: I just \u2026 always wanted to be a ranger!</p></blockquote><p>So while everyone around Jon realizes that he is made for leadership, even as he displays alpha tendencies galore, Jon\u2019s dream was to be a follower, not the ultimate authority. I think that hankers back to the hierarchy within the Stark family where the only Stark child actively prepared for leadership was Robb.\u00a0Incidentally we see Robb embrace that role quickly and effectively because it\u2019s something he always expected he would have to do.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s first instinct is always to put himself at risk over other people and particularly post-resurrection he\u2019s become quite careless with his life.</p><p>He suggest one on one combat against Ramsay, scaring the living daylights out of Sansa. During the battle of the bastards, fans tend to focus a lot on Jon\u2019s charge in trying to save Rickon. I don\u2019t really take that into account as much because it seemed like a natural reaction of a man desperately trying to save his kid brother. However, during that same battle, he charges singlehandendly against an army not once but twice: Once after Rickon is killed and the second when Ramsay runs from the battlefield (once again terrifying Sansa - no wonder the poor girl tells him over and over again that he needs to be smarter).\u00a0</p><p>And this trend continues in season 7 as well when he not only offers himself up for the wight hunt but also charges the zombie army on his own instead of getting on the freaking dragon.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s very much the mindset of a warrior ready to face off against impossible odds but it\u2019s not something Jon is allowed to do anymore because:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Davos: You can\u2019t lead a raid beyond the wall. You\u2019re not in the Night\u2019s Watch anymore. You\u2019re King in the North!</p></blockquote><p>Exactly, Davos! Exactly!</p><p>Jon can\u2019t go around charging head first into impossible to win situations because he has a responsibility to the people he\u2019s leading and because without him, the entire army/kingdom disintegrates.\u00a0</p><p>And in a way, I think Jon knew that at some point. During the attack on the wall by Mance\u2019s forces, Jon acts not only bravely but strategically and decisively. And it\u2019s the result of his good decision making that Grenn ends up dying.\u00a0</p><p>I think the guilt from that decision never left Jon which is why now he ends up preferring to put himself at risk than ask others to do it.\u00a0</p><p>But, unfortunately for him, Jon Snow was never meant to be 1st ranger. He is meant to be king and a medieval king, while needing to be a warrior, also needs to be a commander and a strategist, one that at some point will have to send good men, loyal men to their deaths. And he needs to learn to live with that.\u00a0</p><p>Which in essence is the real lesson that needs to be learned from book Ned\u2019s commentary on the difference between a leader and the men he has under his command.</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!\u00a0</p>",

On a general note, I sometimes prioritize answering asks that come as reactions to one of my posts or that are related to newly released info/promo/photos because I feel that letting those asks sit in my inbox for too long kind of defeats the purpose of them. Which means I don\u2019t always go in a chronological order when answering questions. So if you see that I haven\u2019t answered your ask, please don\u2019t get discouraged. It\u2019s very likely that it\u2019s sitting there waiting for me to find time to give an in-depth answer.\u00a0</i></p><p>Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s do this, nonnie!</p><p>Btw, love the sheer exasperation coming off of your post. What woman hasn\u2019t asked the\u00a0\u201cWill he ever learn\u201d question at least once in their lives. Men are from Mars and women are from Venus, indeed. :)))</p><p>I actually thought that this would be a good time for me to talk a bit more broadly about what I think Jon\u2019s major two flaws/issues are at the moment and why I feel it\u2019s important for him to overcome them, particularly in the likelihood of him becoming king at the end of season 8.\u00a0</p><p><b>The first one, as you already pointed out in your ask, is poor communication or, even more generally, his tendency to act as a lone wolf.\u00a0</b></p><p>This is a bit of a pickle for me because it\u2019s one aspect, I feel, where book Jon differs from show Jon. I think book Jon displays lone wolf characteristics prior to his death. He essentially cuts himself off from his Night Watch brothers, sends Sam to Old Town and seems to take to heart Ned\u2019s mindset of what being a leader is, which is to say that you can love your men but you cannot be their friend. Book Jon applies that to his Night Watch command and it\u2019s in part the reason why he ends up being killed. He just becomes isolated and alone which in turn makes him vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Show Jon, I feel, doesn\u2019t do that. Sam leaves for Old Town because he wants to go, despite Jon\u2019s apprehensions and desire that he stay. He explains again and again the importance of the alliance with the Wildlings to his men and takes Ed with him to Hardhome. In private, he attempts to make Ollie see his reasons for making this decision. So I wouldn\u2019t say that poor communication is what gets show Jon killed.\u00a0</p><p>What gets show Jon killed is Allister Thorne, essentially. For one, there is a strong personal animosity there that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. For two, I genuinely believe that Allister Throne is committed to the Night\u2019s Watch and sees Jon as a dangerous element that needs to be stopped. So he gets his allies together and they plot against him. I don\u2019t think the rest of the group is really as personally invested in the assassination as Thorne is, they\u2019re simply his followers.\u00a0</p><p>The one glaring exception is Ollie whose motivations for killing Jon are deeply personal and, perhaps, from all of them, the one that is most understandable. He sees what Jon is doing as a personal betrayal and he is essentially taking revenge. It\u2019s interesting to note that Ollie\u2019s actions are the ones that hurt Jon the most and the first thing he remembers when he comes back from the dead. In many ways, I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s over Ollie killing him or that he had to execute him for it.\u00a0</p><p>Also important to mention here is that post-assassination, Allister and his group do not receive the support they were perhaps expecting.

Book Jon applies that to his Night Watch command and it\u2019s in part the reason why he ends up being killed. He just becomes isolated and alone which in turn makes him vulnerable.\u00a0</p><p>Show Jon, I feel, doesn\u2019t do that. Sam leaves for Old Town because he wants to go, despite Jon\u2019s apprehensions and desire that he stay. He explains again and again the importance of the alliance with the Wildlings to his men and takes Ed with him to Hardhome. In private, he attempts to make Ollie see his reasons for making this decision. So I wouldn\u2019t say that poor communication is what gets show Jon killed.\u00a0</p><p>What gets show Jon killed is Allister Thorne, essentially. For one, there is a strong personal animosity there that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. For two, I genuinely believe that Allister Throne is committed to the Night\u2019s Watch and sees Jon as a dangerous element that needs to be stopped. So he gets his allies together and they plot against him. I don\u2019t think the rest of the group is really as personally invested in the assassination as Thorne is, they\u2019re simply his followers.\u00a0</p><p>The one glaring exception is Ollie whose motivations for killing Jon are deeply personal and, perhaps, from all of them, the one that is most understandable. He sees what Jon is doing as a personal betrayal and he is essentially taking revenge. It\u2019s interesting to note that Ollie\u2019s actions are the ones that hurt Jon the most and the first thing he remembers when he comes back from the dead. In many ways, I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s over Ollie killing him or that he had to execute him for it.\u00a0</p><p>Also important to mention here is that post-assassination, Allister and his group do not receive the support they were perhaps expecting. Ed and a few men loyal to Jon go as far as to oppose them outright and the rest of the Night\u2019s Watch accept what happened because there is seemingly nothing to be done. Which is why when the Wildlings storm Castle Black, most of the Night\u2019s Watch isn\u2019t exactly chopping at the bit to protect Throne and his knife wielders.\u00a0</p><p>The reason why I say all this is because I feel like Jon\u2019s lone wolf tendencies are very much a product of his resurrection and the betrayal he suffered through at the hands of men that called themselves his brothers. He\u2019s naturally a man that values collaboration and communication, over imposing his will unilaterally.\u00a0</p><p>So in that sense, I do think in time he will get back there and be more open to communicating and debating his decisions. His communication issues are very much like Sansa\u2019s trust issues. They\u2019ve both suffered traumas and had their confidence in people abused and shaken, so they\u2019re both reluctant to opening up fully. Also it\u2019s important to note that once it becomes clear to him that Sansa feels excluded and wants her opinion heard, he adjusts and asks her opinion when it comes to Tyrion. So he is trying. That\u2019s something. :)</p><p>There\u2019s also a point to be made to what I believe are the differences between the two instances where Jon blindsides Sansa with his decisions, because I don\u2019t think his motivation or intentions were the same in both of them.\u00a0</p><p>In the undermine me scene, I don\u2019t think it occurs to Jon that Sansa would disagree with his decision to pardon Alys Karstark and Ned Umber. In his mind he is making the decision his father would have made (I\u2019m not sure Ned would have done that but Jon tends to idealize him to a degree) so he thinks Sansa will have the same view on the subject as he does. In that sense, I think he\u2019s genuinely surprised that Sansa disagrees with it. He decides to focus on the\u00a0\u201cundermining\u201d aspect of her disagreement but I think in many respects that\u2019s him deflecting what it truly bothering him which is that he feels Sansa doesn\u2019t trust him enough to have faith in his decisions and that she would be so adamant to punish two young children.\u00a0</p><p>So his reaction to her challenging him is very personal and is a sign of deep vulnerability when it comes to her that he\u2019s trying (not very well) to hide under some sort of political savvy pretense.\u00a0</p><p>Then there\u2019s the scene where he announces to the Great Council that he has decided to go to Dragonstone. Sansa is naturally shocked by this because they\u2019ve already discussed the subject and both her and Davos tell him not to go.\u00a0</p><p>The interesting thing about this scene is that Jon isn\u2019t surprised by her reaction this time. He looks as if he\u2019s expecting it actually. On top of that, Davos is surprised as well which means he didn\u2019t discuss it with him either.\u00a0</p><p>What that tells me is that the reason why he doesn\u2019t talk to Sansa beforehand is not a matter of poor communication in this instance but rather that he chooses not to tell her. The question is: why?\u00a0</p><p>Jonsa fans have theorized that Jon finds it hard to be alone with Sansa because of his personal feelings for her. That may very well be part of the reason for it but, more importantly, I think he doesn\u2019t talk to her beforehand because he doesn\u2019t want to be talked out of leaving.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s put it this way: Jon Snow is not an idiot. He knows going to Dragonstone is dangerous and risky. He knows that he might get killed or captured. He knows all of the things that Sansa tells him during the Council. But he still feels like he has to go because he needs men and dragonglass and dragons. So he avoids the council of Davos and Sansa, in particular, because he doesn\u2019t want to hear the reasons why he shouldn\u2019t go, he doesn\u2019t want to think of the risk he\u2019s placing Sansa in by leaving her alone and he tries, instead, to convince himself that all will work out well.\u00a0</p><p>Which brings us to Jon\u2019s second major issue and one that, unlike his poor communication skills that need some adjustment but are not, in my view, catastrophic in the grand scheme of things (we all have flaws, after all), jeopardizes him and those he loves time and time again. And one that he really needs to get a handle on if he is ever to be a successful king:\u00a0</p><p><b>His\u00a0\u201c1st ranger\u201d mindset:\u00a0</b></p><blockquote><p>Sansa: Then send an emissary. Don\u2019t go yourself!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote><p>Jon: The Free Folk will help us.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Davos: They won\u2019t follow Ser Jorah.\u00a0</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jon: They won\u2019t have to.\u00a0</p></blockquote><p>Time and time again we\u2019ve seen Jon put himself at great risk and offer himself up for dangerous, almost suicidal missions. In theory, all of this has the makings of a hero which is great but, as D*ny puts it, heroes don\u2019t tend to live very long because they end up doing stupid things.\u00a0</p><p>In order to understand where this issues comes from, we need to look back to what Jon first stated he had ever wanted, which was to be a ranger in the Night\u2019s Watch and, in time, 1st ranger like his uncle Benjen.</p><p>While all the men of the Night\u2019s Watch are expected to bare arms in the case of an attack, the rangers are the real soldiers of the order. So in essence what Jon always wanted to be was a warrior.\u00a0</p><p>Which is great, except that as early as season 1 he\u2019s been constantly derailed from that desire. He wanted to be a ranger but became Joer Mormont\u2019s stewart instead, something he felt was a punishment. It took Sam to point out that the Lord Commander asking for him personally meant that Jon was being prepared for command. But that didn\u2019t seem to make Jon all that happy because and I quote:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Jon: I just \u2026 always wanted to be a ranger!</p></blockquote><p>So while everyone around Jon realizes that he is made for leadership, even as he displays alpha tendencies galore, Jon\u2019s dream was to be a follower, not the ultimate authority. I think that hankers back to the hierarchy within the Stark family where the only Stark child actively prepared for leadership was Robb.\u00a0Incidentally we see Robb embrace that role quickly and effectively because it\u2019s something he always expected he would have to do.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Jon\u2019s first instinct is always to put himself at risk over other people and particularly post-resurrection he\u2019s become quite careless with his life.</p><p>He suggest one on one combat against Ramsay, scaring the living daylights out of Sansa. During the battle of the bastards, fans tend to focus a lot on Jon\u2019s charge in trying to save Rickon. I don\u2019t really take that into account as much because it seemed like a natural reaction of a man desperately trying to save his kid brother. However, during that same battle, he charges singlehandendly against an army not once but twice: Once after Rickon is killed and the second when Ramsay runs from the battlefield (once again terrifying Sansa - no wonder the poor girl tells him over and over again that he needs to be smarter).\u00a0</p><p>And this trend continues in season 7 as well when he not only offers himself up for the wight hunt but also charges the zombie army on his own instead of getting on the freaking dragon.\u00a0</p><p>That\u2019s very much the mindset of a warrior ready to face off against impossible odds but it\u2019s not something Jon is allowed to do anymore because:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>Davos: You can\u2019t lead a raid beyond the wall. You\u2019re not in the Night\u2019s Watch anymore. You\u2019re King in the North!</p></blockquote><p>Exactly, Davos! Exactly!</p><p>Jon can\u2019t go around charging head first into impossible to win situations because he has a responsibility to the people he\u2019s leading and because without him, the entire army/kingdom disintegrates.\u00a0</p><p>And in a way, I think Jon knew that at some point. During the attack on the wall by Mance\u2019s forces, Jon acts not only bravely but strategically and decisively. And it\u2019s the result of his good decision making that Grenn ends up dying.\u00a0</p><p>I think the guilt from that decision never left Jon which is why now he ends up preferring to put himself at risk than ask others to do it.\u00a0</p><p>But, unfortunately for him, Jon Snow was never meant to be 1st ranger. He is meant to be king and a medieval king, while needing to be a warrior, also needs to be a commander and a strategist, one that at some point will have to send good men, loyal men to their deaths. And he needs to learn to live with that.\u00a0</p><p>Which in essence is the real lesson that needs to be learned from book Ned\u2019s commentary on the difference between a leader and the men he has under his command.</p><p>Thanks for the ask, nonnie!\u00a0</p>",
                "content": "<p>Hey, nonnie!</p><p><i>First of all, I&rsquo;d like to apologize for taking this long to answer. You guys have been sending me a lot of asks, which I love, so it&rsquo;s taking me quite some time to go through all of them. On a general note, I sometimes prioritize answering asks that come as reactions to one of my posts or that are related to newly released info/promo/photos because I feel that letting those asks sit in my inbox for too long kind of defeats the purpose of them. Which means I don&rsquo;t always go in a chronological order when answering questions. So if you see that I haven&rsquo;t answered your ask, please don&rsquo;t get discouraged.

This had proven to be something of a black stain on the Stark family name, which is why her own mother had always hesitated in taking Jon to important social functions. It all seemed so silly now. Everything about her life in Boston seemed so&hellip; frail and frivolous. Shattered as easily as a pretty pane of stained glass.</p><p>Now they were both orphans. To Sansa, at least, Jon is the last remaining tie to a childhood that shines now like a star in the aftermath of loss and grief. He&rsquo;s the only one left to her.</p>",

The notoriuos pink letter that Jon receives in his last chapter therefore might be true, meaning that Stannis dies before Jon and that GRRM just leaves us in the dark about that.

I have the suspicion that Jon will realise earlier than Sansa that his feelings are not appropriate and if we really see inside Jon\u2019s head, it would be more difficult to hide Jon\u2019s feeling - although GRRM could manage on the other hand. Still, I think it is possible that we won\u2019t get Jon\u2019s PoV until after his meeting with Da\u20acnerys and the set-up of Political Jon. For Political Jon to work we would have to stay in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 or her advisors\u2019 PoV and Jon\u2019s PoV must be hidden. I think that would be easier, if there was no Jon PoV before that. But this is of course highly speculative, and I have been trapped by the PoV trap often enough myself that I believe that GRRM can manage this difficulty.

Still, I think it is possible that we won\u2019t get Jon\u2019s PoV until after his meeting with Da\u20acnerys and the set-up of Political Jon. For Political Jon to work we would have to stay in Da\u20acnerys\u2019 or her advisors\u2019 PoV and Jon\u2019s PoV must be hidden. I think that would be easier, if there was no Jon PoV before that.

        "body": "<p>Jon Snow is arguably the most important character in Game of Thrones. After all the book series is named after him. So what awaits him in Season 8 of Game of Thrones.</p><p>Here I am going to look into my theories for what awaiting our favourite Stargaryen. I&rsquo;m going to do this episode by episode as I think it will be easier that way.</p><p>Episode 1.</p><p>Super awkward first meeting between Sansa and Daenerys and no Arya to be scene (sorry guys but the Jon/Arya reunion is such a big deal I think they will withhold it as long as possible - potentially even episode 2). We will get a meeting between Jon, Dany, Sansa and all the\u00a0big characters in the North talking about what they will do to prepare for the war. Sansa will hopefully immediately point out that Cersei will betray them instantly and if Jaime makes in to Winterfell this episode he can back this up.</p><p>And then the big one - Bran drops the bombshell we have all been waiting for. It would be funny if he said it in front on everyone but since Sam is there he will probably make sure they tell Jon alone. Immediate BSOD for Jon - Ned isn&rsquo;t his dad and he shagged his aunt. The Horror. It either ends with him telling Dany and they temporarily breakup or the next episode starts this way but they are both going to be upset (for different reasons) but Jon will then head to the crypts.</p><p>Episode 2.</p><p>I believe this is where we are going to get Jon/Arya reunion - here is my reasoning. This reunion has so much weight behind it, people have wanted it for so long and it will be the last Stark reunion in the show what better way to show how much these two characters love each other then by having Arya be the one person able to talk Jon out of his funk. Have\u00a0her character, who has been described as being so much like Lyanna, be the one in front of her statue to get Jon to accept his heritage.</p><p>He will then go to Dany and reassure her that he is not interested in the throne but I don&rsquo;t think this will re-start the relationship yet as she will have her own issues to deal with. Eventually this episode if Dany is pregnant it will come out and then we hear the army of the dead is marching towards them.</p><p>Episode 3.</p><p>The big battle for Winterfell - there won&rsquo;t be too much in the way of obvious character stuff here for Jon but I think one very important thing will happen. Dany will not be able to fly - she is either pregnant or she gets injured early on and is grounded. This means that Jon ends up having to fly Rhaegal now that he has accepted his Targaryen half. I believe they are actually going to win this fight (I might be the only one). My theory is that the Night King knowing that Bran is watching him sent a smaller force to Winterfell with maybe 3-4 White Walkers while he continues south with Viserion. So the battle will be hard and there will be a lot of death and destruction but ultimately they do win. But it ends on a slight downer as they realise the Night King wasn&rsquo;t there and they lost a lot of people.</p><p>Episode 4. </p><p>Jon is now\u00a0a dragon rider and realises that the Nights King is heading to King&rsquo;s Landing so he intends to fly down to warn Cersei. (It&rsquo;s a good thing he is cute because sometimes he is dumb as a bag of rocks). He and Dany officially make up before he goes and unbeknownst to him Arya/Hound and maybe a couple of others also start marking their way down there as well. So Jon immediately gets taken hostage and Cersei will try and show her preparations for the army of the dead, dragons, unsullied\u00a0etc. with the Scorpions and Golden Company. Jon will as politely as he knows how call her a moron. This goes over as well as you would expect.</p><p>Episode 5 and 6.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not fully sure of the order of a lot of this stuff so I am putting the episodes together. Jon gets rescued by Arya. There will be a huge battle and he either kills or somehow saves the Night King. My money is on kill but it could go either way. It least half of the last episode is back to politics and who sits the Iron Throne. Remember it&rsquo;s call Game of Thrones not The White Walking Dead so Jon very reluctantly becomes King and wants to marry Dany but the north are unhappy as she is Targaryen and he is half Targaryen so as a political alliance Arya also has to marry him (I don&rsquo;t mean this as a romantic thing at all - they would all be unhappy over this) so everything goes back to how it was with original Aegon with Arya as Visenya and Dany as Rhaenys. And that is how it ends up being bittersweet - they are all unhappy with it and ultimately nothing has changed and the Game of Thrones plays on. </p><p>Or if we want a slightly happier ending they all accept it and decide to make the most of the situation with the hope of change for the future.</p><p>So that is my Jon Snow theory and I will be doing Arya next and then Dany and so on through our main cast. I know a lot of people will hate the theory due to the Jonarya aspect but I just don&rsquo;t think GRRM changed is ending just how he gets there. Remember guys sometimes different roads lead to the same castle.</p>",

A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, <b>but Jon did not like Joffrey&rsquo;s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell&rsquo;s Great Hall.\n\n</b><br /></p></blockquote><p>So next time you say that Jon knows nothing/has no insight consider that the kid was able to tell Cersei and Joffrey were bad news from one look at them.&nbsp;</p>",
