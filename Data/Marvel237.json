No one seemed to notice her silence, her lack of participation in the planning process, her lack of everything. \u00a0</p><p>She enjoyed being invisible, \u00a0welcomed it actually. It gave her time to think of her own plan. She made sure she stayed as invisible as she could when everyone else was in the room. If they began questioning her about her lack of life she\u2019d probably break, especially if they made Thor ask her. </p><p>She had figured out what she had to do while the others still theorized about how they could bring Thanos down. She had it all planned out from how she would get to him, to how she would bring the others back. She had also planned out how she would keep the others from stopping her from doing this alone. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLiz, are you with us\u201d Steve asked gently shaking her shoulder in an attempt to bring her out of whatever kind of state she was in. She blinked a few times bringing herself back to the present conversation. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony thinks we can somehow reverse time to before Thanos\u2019s snap.\u201d Natasha replied in an irritated tone. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. None of you have the tools or power to get to him.\u201d Liz was determined to try and keep everyone going down the wrong track so she could successfully execute her plan. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Bruce asked as he cleaned his glasses on his shirt. </p><p>\u201cBecause. None of you have any special powers that would allow you to accomplish such a thing. I gotta make a phone call.\u201d Liz stepped out of the room and prayed to every God that her call would be answered as she pressed the number three for her speed dial contact. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The voice on the other end sounded confused. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I need your help. Come to Wakanda, I\u2019ll be at the lake.\u201d With those simple instructions Liz hung up the phone and pulled out the battery. \u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>She sat on her bed holding a picture of her and Loki in her hands. As she stared down at it tears began to fill her eyes. She remembered that day. Loki had asked a random passerby to take a picture of them, he told her to smile before pulling her in close, wrapping both of his arms around her in a warm, loving embrace. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou got a moment?\u201d Natasha asked as she tapped softly on the wall. Liz quickly wiped her face before looking up. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Come in.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say I was out of line that day. I deserved the words you threw at me, and the fact that you actually threw me. So, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Natasha looked extremely uncomfortable as she stood there waiting for an answer. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm.. It was a stressful day. We both said some things that were out of anger, and stress so I\u2019m sorry as well.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, good. Now that\u2019s cleared up can I ask you something?\u201d </p><p> Liz desperately wanted to roll her eyes and show how annoyed she was that Natasha was still standing there wanting to talk. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you call?\u201d </p><p> Liz narrowed her eyes and took a deep breath. </p><p>\u201cNone of your business. If I wanted everyone to know who I called I would\u2019ve stayed out there and made my call. If you have any more questions keep them to yourself, I won\u2019t be answering anymore.\u201d She let the venom drip of the end of every syllable. </p><p>Natasha didn\u2019t say anything, only stood there looking like an idiot before she turned around and stomped off. Liz sighed and pulled the notebook and a pen out from their spot on her shelf. She sat on her bed staring at the picture of her and Loki to help give her some sort of motivation to write her note. \u00a0</p><p>Thor, Rocket, and Okoye had come back to her room checking to see if she was hungry, wanted to go for a walk, or just wanted some company. She turned them down each time. Finally Rocket had come back to her room for a third time, didn\u2019t say anything, only jumped onto the bed and curled up by her feet. Liz smiled before going back to staring at the same photo when it finally hit her on what she would put in her note. \u00a0</p><p>The next day she sat at the counter with the others as they ate breakfast. No one spoke that morning of strategies, or theories that could work. It was quiet, too quiet for Liz\u2019s liking. She broke the silence before it drove her mad. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve, can you help me take care of the goat. Bucky would kick my ass if that goat didn\u2019t get any attention.\u201d Liz did her best to sound as positive as she could for everyone, she wanted them to think she was getting better and coming to terms with everything. Steve smiled and nodded his head </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019d love to do something other than talk strategy.\u201d He gave her a soft smile before taking care of his plate. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the goats\u2019s name?\u201d Thor asked poking his bacon. Giving it a confused look before taking a bite. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Liz whispered as she lowered her head. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked as he turned around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, the goat\u2019s name is Steve. I guess Bucky named him after you since the goat kept trying to headbutt things bigger than him.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Thor let out a wall shaking laugh. The others let their own snickers out while Steve stood there dumbfounded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d He asked as he scratched the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cHe named him Steve, I call him Mr. Goat. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind either one.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll take care of Mr. Goat and have a word with Bucky when I see him again.\u201d Steve smiled and shook his head as he walked out of the house. \u00a0</p><p>For a good two hours everyone would make jokes about Steve having a goat named after him. After awhile all the jokes were used up and no one found it funny anymore. That was the first time everyone had laughed and smiled since Thanos destroyed half the planet. Liz had to admit that it did feel good to laugh and smile. Everyone relished in the feel of happiness again even with everything that had happened in such a short period of time. \u00a0</p><p>Liz had retired to her room for the evening. She seen no reason to sit around and talk with the others when she had things to do. She wasn\u2019t expecting her company to show up for another day or so if she showed up at all. Liz prepared her things, labeled who got what and worked on her note, which seemed more like a letter. A soft knock on the door pulled her out of her closet as she peered her head around the corner she seen Tony standing awkwardly outside her room. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She asked stepping out and wiping her hands on her jeans after touching something gooey on the top shelf. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI uh. I wanted to say I\u2019m glad your doing better, even if you are faking it. I\u2019m glad you smiled and laughed today.\u201d Tony seemed uncomfortable talking to her. It had always been like that with them, never truly knew what to say to each other in times of comfort. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks Tony. I uh. I\u2019m sorry about being so distant, I\u2019m just dealing with everything in my own way and needed some space.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know. I just, I thought after you disappeared last year I would never see you again. Pepper was on my ass constantly about finding you, I tried. Believe me I did. I just.. I couldn\u2019t find you. I knew how mad you were about everything that happened so I thought it was best to leave you alone.\u201d Liz held a hand up to stop him from talking. She couldn\u2019t hear his apology or admission of guilt right now. She had to stay focused on the task at hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, its fine. I was getting ready for bed. So if you can hold this conversation off till tomorrow that would be great.\u201d Tony gave her a slightly sad smile but agreed to hold it off till she was ready for it. \u00a0</p><p>After he left, she closed her door and locked it so no one else could intrude on her, or make her want to stay. She folded her note and set it on her bed where someone could find it once they broke the door down. She snuck out her window and ran to the lake. \u00a0</p><p>She stood there watching the water ripple from bugs when she heard the sound of a familiar landing behind her. She smiled and turned around. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would show up.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou never call me, of course I\u2019d show up.\u201d Carol replied as she stepped closer. \u00a0</p><p>They stood side by side staring at the sunset in silence. Liz enjoyed it as much as she could in case it would be her last one. She finally broke the silence by stripping her top layer of clothes off leaving her in a tank top and shorts. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d She asked turning to look at Carol. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Carol gave her a concerned look. </p><p>\u201cYeah Danvers. I\u2019m the only person who can do this. Wait for my signal kay?\u201d Liz had small tears forming in her eyes as she stepped out into the middle of the lake. She knew everyone would be upset once they found her note, that they would rush out here to stop her. She couldn\u2019t allow that. She had to do this now. \u00a0</p><p>She was treading water when she gave Carol the signal, she held her arms up as high as she dared as Carol blasted her with energy. \u00a0She could feel every single particle in her body powering up. She closed her eyes and focused all of her energy on getting to Thanos. She began to feel the familiar burn of power course through her veins. She revealed in the old familiar feel of strength. Just as she was beginning to enjoy the power she took off leaving Carol and everyone else behind. \u00a0</p>",

No one seemed to notice her silence, her lack of participation in the planning process, her lack of everything. \u00a0</p><p>She enjoyed being invisible, \u00a0welcomed it actually. It gave her time to think of her own plan. She made sure she stayed as invisible as she could when everyone else was in the room. If they began questioning her about her lack of life she\u2019d probably break, especially if they made Thor ask her. </p><p>She had figured out what she had to do while the others still theorized about how they could bring Thanos down. She had it all planned out from how she would get to him, to how she would bring the others back. She had also planned out how she would keep the others from stopping her from doing this alone. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cLiz, are you with us\u201d Steve asked gently shaking her shoulder in an attempt to bring her out of whatever kind of state she was in. She blinked a few times bringing herself back to the present conversation. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTony thinks we can somehow reverse time to before Thanos\u2019s snap.\u201d Natasha replied in an irritated tone. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. None of you have the tools or power to get to him.\u201d Liz was determined to try and keep everyone going down the wrong track so she could successfully execute her plan. </p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Bruce asked as he cleaned his glasses on his shirt. </p><p>\u201cBecause. None of you have any special powers that would allow you to accomplish such a thing. I gotta make a phone call.\u201d Liz stepped out of the room and prayed to every God that her call would be answered as she pressed the number three for her speed dial contact. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The voice on the other end sounded confused. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I need your help. Come to Wakanda, I\u2019ll be at the lake.\u201d With those simple instructions Liz hung up the phone and pulled out the battery. \u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>She sat on her bed holding a picture of her and Loki in her hands. As she stared down at it tears began to fill her eyes. She remembered that day. Loki had asked a random passerby to take a picture of them, he told her to smile before pulling her in close, wrapping both of his arms around her in a warm, loving embrace. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou got a moment?\u201d Natasha asked as she tapped softly on the wall. Liz quickly wiped her face before looking up. </p><p>\u201cYeah. Come in.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say I was out of line that day. I deserved the words you threw at me, and the fact that you actually threw me. So, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Natasha looked extremely uncomfortable as she stood there waiting for an answer. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cUmm.. It was a stressful day. We both said some things that were out of anger, and stress so I\u2019m sorry as well.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, good. Now that\u2019s cleared up can I ask you something?\u201d </p><p> Liz desperately wanted to roll her eyes and show how annoyed she was that Natasha was still standing there wanting to talk. </p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you call?\u201d </p><p> Liz narrowed her eyes and took a deep breath. </p><p>\u201cNone of your business. If I wanted everyone to know who I called I would\u2019ve stayed out there and made my call. If you have any more questions keep them to yourself, I won\u2019t be answering anymore.\u201d She let the venom drip of the end of every syllable. </p><p>Natasha didn\u2019t say anything, only stood there looking like an idiot before she turned around and stomped off. Liz sighed and pulled the notebook and a pen out from their spot on her shelf. She sat on her bed staring at the picture of her and Loki to help give her some sort of motivation to write her note. \u00a0</p><p>Thor, Rocket, and Okoye had come back to her room checking to see if she was hungry, wanted to go for a walk, or just wanted some company. She turned them down each time. Finally Rocket had come back to her room for a third time, didn\u2019t say anything, only jumped onto the bed and curled up by her feet. Liz smiled before going back to staring at the same photo when it finally hit her on what she would put in her note. \u00a0</p><p>The next day she sat at the counter with the others as they ate breakfast. No one spoke that morning of strategies, or theories that could work. It was quiet, too quiet for Liz\u2019s liking. She broke the silence before it drove her mad. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve, can you help me take care of the goat. Bucky would kick my ass if that goat didn\u2019t get any attention.\u201d Liz did her best to sound as positive as she could for everyone, she wanted them to think she was getting better and coming to terms with everything. Steve smiled and nodded his head </p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019d love to do something other than talk strategy.\u201d He gave her a soft smile before taking care of his plate. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the goats\u2019s name?\u201d Thor asked poking his bacon. Giving it a confused look before taking a bite. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSteve.\u201d Liz whispered as she lowered her head. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked as he turned around. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, the goat\u2019s name is Steve. I guess Bucky named him after you since the goat kept trying to headbutt things bigger than him.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Thor let out a wall shaking laugh. The others let their own snickers out while Steve stood there dumbfounded. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe did what?\u201d He asked as he scratched the back of his neck. </p><p>\u201cHe named him Steve, I call him Mr. Goat. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind either one.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll take care of Mr. Goat and have a word with Bucky when I see him again.\u201d Steve smiled and shook his head as he walked out of the house. \u00a0</p><p>For a good two hours everyone would make jokes about Steve having a goat named after him. After awhile all the jokes were used up and no one found it funny anymore. That was the first time everyone had laughed and smiled since Thanos destroyed half the planet. Liz had to admit that it did feel good to laugh and smile. Everyone relished in the feel of happiness again even with everything that had happened in such a short period of time. \u00a0</p><p>Liz had retired to her room for the evening. She seen no reason to sit around and talk with the others when she had things to do. She wasn\u2019t expecting her company to show up for another day or so if she showed up at all. Liz prepared her things, labeled who got what and worked on her note, which seemed more like a letter. A soft knock on the door pulled her out of her closet as she peered her head around the corner she seen Tony standing awkwardly outside her room. </p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She asked stepping out and wiping her hands on her jeans after touching something gooey on the top shelf. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI uh. I wanted to say I\u2019m glad your doing better, even if you are faking it. I\u2019m glad you smiled and laughed today.\u201d Tony seemed uncomfortable talking to her. It had always been like that with them, never truly knew what to say to each other in times of comfort. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks Tony. I uh. I\u2019m sorry about being so distant, I\u2019m just dealing with everything in my own way and needed some space.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know. I just, I thought after you disappeared last year I would never see you again. Pepper was on my ass constantly about finding you, I tried. Believe me I did. I just.. I couldn\u2019t find you. I knew how mad you were about everything that happened so I thought it was best to leave you alone.\u201d Liz held a hand up to stop him from talking. She couldn\u2019t hear his apology or admission of guilt right now. She had to stay focused on the task at hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cTony, its fine. I was getting ready for bed. So if you can hold this conversation off till tomorrow that would be great.\u201d Tony gave her a slightly sad smile but agreed to hold it off till she was ready for it. \u00a0</p><p>After he left, she closed her door and locked it so no one else could intrude on her, or make her want to stay. She folded her note and set it on her bed where someone could find it once they broke the door down. She snuck out her window and ran to the lake. \u00a0</p><p>She stood there watching the water ripple from bugs when she heard the sound of a familiar landing behind her. She smiled and turned around. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would show up.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou never call me, of course I\u2019d show up.\u201d Carol replied as she stepped closer. \u00a0</p><p>They stood side by side staring at the sunset in silence. Liz enjoyed it as much as she could in case it would be her last one. She finally broke the silence by stripping her top layer of clothes off leaving her in a tank top and shorts. </p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d She asked turning to look at Carol. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d Carol gave her a concerned look. </p><p>\u201cYeah Danvers. I\u2019m the only person who can do this. Wait for my signal kay?\u201d Liz had small tears forming in her eyes as she stepped out into the middle of the lake. She knew everyone would be upset once they found her note, that they would rush out here to stop her. She couldn\u2019t allow that. She had to do this now. \u00a0</p><p>She was treading water when she gave Carol the signal, she held her arms up as high as she dared as Carol blasted her with energy. \u00a0She could feel every single particle in her body powering up. She closed her eyes and focused all of her energy on getting to Thanos. She began to feel the familiar burn of power course through her veins. She revealed in the old familiar feel of strength. Just as she was beginning to enjoy the power she took off leaving Carol and everyone else behind. \u00a0</p>",

He liked Eddie\u2019s new girlfriend. She was sweet, kind, and extremely patient. She didn\u2019t run away screaming when Eddie told her about Venom. She just gave him a soft smile and said okay. Venom had to beg Eddie to meet her. Eddie was hesitant, but Y/n was willing to meet the symbiote.<br/></p><p>Venom was immediately smitten by her. She was his little one. He wanted to protect her at all costs. She intrigued him. Y/n made really good food. He and Eddie never went hungry. Y/n never yelled at him for eating bad people. She always just shrugged her shoulders and mentioned how they probably deserved to be eaten.</p><p>Today, Venom was listening carefully. There was something going on today. Y/n had been excited all month. She spent every day decorating her small house and ending the night with Eddie watching a horror movie, but there was something about today. Y/n had come home from the store with bags full of candy. She and Eddie spent time opening the bags and dumping them into decorative bowls.</p><p>\u201cV, settle down,\u201d Eddie growled.</p><p>Y/n looked over at her boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cVenom being antsy?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways, but today is worse,\u201d Eddie shot back.</p><p>\u201cCould it be the holiday?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>Eddie shrugged. He pushed back against Venom ordering the symbiote to relax, but Venom couldn\u2019t. He was excited. He was feeding off Y/n\u2019s excitement and he wanted to know why she would spend so much money on bags of candy.</p><p>As the day went on, Venom noticed that Y/n had changed out of her normal clothes and dressed in a costume. Eddie and her talked about how the kids would be coming soon to collect candy.</p><p>Venom couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He needed to know what was going on. Once Eddie was alone in the bedroom getting around to change into his own costume for the night, Venom lost his patience.</p><p>Y/n looked up from the bowl of candy when she heard a grunt and thud.</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d Y/n called out as she walked towards her bedroom.</p><p>She paused in midstep when Venom\u2019s large form exited her bedroom. Y/n sighed and then crossed her arms over her chest. She looked up at the large symbiote and gave him a disappointed look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this was the costume Eddie and I agreed on,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom only grinned his long tongue slipping out and dropping a large pool of drool all over her floor.</p><p>\u201cSo many questions, little one. Eddie wouldn\u2019t answer them,\u201d Venom told her.</p><p>Y/n sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad, little one?\u201d Venom asked.</p><p>\u201cAnnoyed, but it\u2019s fine, I\u2019d be more than happy to tell you what\u2019s going on,\u201d Y/n answered.</p><p>Venom trailed behind Y/n out of the living room and back to the hallway where she had two bowls of candy resting on the table.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get into the whole history of Halloween right now, but nowadays the new version of Halloween is for the kiddos. They dress up in costumes and go around the neighborhoods. If the light is on outside the kiddos can go up to the door and knock. They yell \u201ctrick or treat\u201d and that earns them a piece of candy,\u201d Y/n explained.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the mini-humans in costumes,\u201d Venom said.</p><p>\u201cWell since you\u2019re not letting Eddie back out any time soon you can help pass out the candy,\u201d Y/n told him.</p><p>Venom stretched out one of his long arms to pull Y/n in close to him. Y/n let a chuckle as Venom attempted to give her a hug. There was a knock on the door and then to Venom\u2019s delight a chorus of \u201ctrick or treat\u201d rang out.</p><p>Venom picked up one of the candy bowls as Y/n opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Y/n exclaimed.</p><p>The small group of kids eyes grew large as Venom came to stand behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a costume,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna have nightmares,\u201d</p><p>\u201cV, let them get their candy,\u201d Y/n said nudging him in the side.</p><p>Venom stepped forward. His massive size dropped a shadow over them. He held out the bowl towards the kids. They all hesitated at first before one of them finally got brave enough to grab a piece. As they all took their candy the shouted their thanks before running off to join their parents at the edge of the yard.</p><p>Y/n stood with Venom in the doorway as his large eyes swept over the neighborhood. Mini-humans were running around laughing, scaring each other, and trying to hit up every house to get a sweet treat.</p><p>Y/n looked up at Venom.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to go trick or treating?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>Venom looked down at her his large teeth forming into a grin.</p><p>\u201cJust put the bowl on the railing of the stairs. The kids will help themselves,\u201d Y/n told him.</p><p>\u201cCan I really go?\u201d Venom asked.</p><p>Y/n chuckled. She disappeared back into the house and then returned with a Halloween themed bag. She held it out towards Venom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need this to collect your candy,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom took the bag from her and then took one last look back at her.</p><p>\u201cGo, I\u2019ll be right behind you,\u201d Y/n urged him.</p><p>Venom about tripped over himself as he hurried down the stairs and out into the street mingling himself with the mini-humans. Y/n only chuckled as she locked the front door behind her and took off after Venom.</p><p>Y/n watched in amusement as a group of kids took a sudden liking to Venom and quickly adopted him as one of their own. Venom stood around in awe as the kids talked his ear off and lead him house to house. The adults were too shocked or stunned in silence to say anything as his deep rough voice rang out with the high pitched voices of the kids demanding for candy.</p><p>Y/n had kind of wished that Eddie and Venom were two separate entities as it would have been nice to walk with Eddie together so the both of them could enjoy watching Venom being adopted by a pack of kids and living his best life.</p><p>But as the night went on, Venom told the kids that he would be back again trudged his way over to Y/n with his bag completely full of candy. Y/n gave him a large smile as he came to stand next to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>\u201cSo much, can\u2019t we do this every day?\u201d Venom asked as they headed back to her house.</p><p>\u201cSorry, V, Halloween is only once a year,\u201d Y/n replied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Venom huffed.</p><p>Y/n laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry I think you\u2019ll enjoy Thanksgiving,\u201d</p><p>Venom stopped at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cCome on inside and I\u2019ll tell you all about how the end of the year has some of the biggest celebrations,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom raced inside practically running Y/n over in excitement. Y/n just laughed and rolled her eyes as she shut the door behind her so she could spend time telling Venom all about Thanksgiving and Christmas only knowing deep down that she was only opening a can of worms for Eddie, but secretly she didn\u2019t care she was looking forward to Venom\u2019s reactions for both holidays.</p>",

He liked Eddie\u2019s new girlfriend. She was sweet, kind, and extremely patient. She didn\u2019t run away screaming when Eddie told her about Venom. She just gave him a soft smile and said okay. Venom had to beg Eddie to meet her. Eddie was hesitant, but Y/n was willing to meet the symbiote.<br></p><p>Venom was immediately smitten by her. She was his little one. He wanted to protect her at all costs. She intrigued him. Y/n made really good food. He and Eddie never went hungry. Y/n never yelled at him for eating bad people. She always just shrugged her shoulders and mentioned how they probably deserved to be eaten.</p><p>Today, Venom was listening carefully. There was something going on today. Y/n had been excited all month. She spent every day decorating her small house and ending the night with Eddie watching a horror movie, but there was something about today. Y/n had come home from the store with bags full of candy. She and Eddie spent time opening the bags and dumping them into decorative bowls.</p><p>\u201cV, settle down,\u201d Eddie growled.</p><p>Y/n looked over at her boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cVenom being antsy?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways, but today is worse,\u201d Eddie shot back.</p><p>\u201cCould it be the holiday?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>Eddie shrugged. He pushed back against Venom ordering the symbiote to relax, but Venom couldn\u2019t. He was excited. He was feeding off Y/n\u2019s excitement and he wanted to know why she would spend so much money on bags of candy.</p><p>As the day went on, Venom noticed that Y/n had changed out of her normal clothes and dressed in a costume. Eddie and her talked about how the kids would be coming soon to collect candy.</p><p>Venom couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He needed to know what was going on. Once Eddie was alone in the bedroom getting around to change into his own costume for the night, Venom lost his patience.</p><p>Y/n looked up from the bowl of candy when she heard a grunt and thud.</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d Y/n called out as she walked towards her bedroom.</p><p>She paused in midstep when Venom\u2019s large form exited her bedroom. Y/n sighed and then crossed her arms over her chest. She looked up at the large symbiote and gave him a disappointed look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this was the costume Eddie and I agreed on,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom only grinned his long tongue slipping out and dropping a large pool of drool all over her floor.</p><p>\u201cSo many questions, little one. Eddie wouldn\u2019t answer them,\u201d Venom told her.</p><p>Y/n sighed.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad, little one?\u201d Venom asked.</p><p>\u201cAnnoyed, but it\u2019s fine, I\u2019d be more than happy to tell you what\u2019s going on,\u201d Y/n answered.</p><p>Venom trailed behind Y/n out of the living room and back to the hallway where she had two bowls of candy resting on the table.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get into the whole history of Halloween right now, but nowadays the new version of Halloween is for the kiddos. They dress up in costumes and go around the neighborhoods. If the light is on outside the kiddos can go up to the door and knock. They yell \u201ctrick or treat\u201d and that earns them a piece of candy,\u201d Y/n explained.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the mini-humans in costumes,\u201d Venom said.</p><p>\u201cWell since you\u2019re not letting Eddie back out any time soon you can help pass out the candy,\u201d Y/n told him.</p><p>Venom stretched out one of his long arms to pull Y/n in close to him. Y/n let a chuckle as Venom attempted to give her a hug. There was a knock on the door and then to Venom\u2019s delight a chorus of \u201ctrick or treat\u201d rang out.</p><p>Venom picked up one of the candy bowls as Y/n opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Y/n exclaimed.</p><p>The small group of kids eyes grew large as Venom came to stand behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a costume,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna have nightmares,\u201d</p><p>\u201cV, let them get their candy,\u201d Y/n said nudging him in the side.</p><p>Venom stepped forward. His massive size dropped a shadow over them. He held out the bowl towards the kids. They all hesitated at first before one of them finally got brave enough to grab a piece. As they all took their candy the shouted their thanks before running off to join their parents at the edge of the yard.</p><p>Y/n stood with Venom in the doorway as his large eyes swept over the neighborhood. Mini-humans were running around laughing, scaring each other, and trying to hit up every house to get a sweet treat.</p><p>Y/n looked up at Venom.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to go trick or treating?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>Venom looked down at her his large teeth forming into a grin.</p><p>\u201cJust put the bowl on the railing of the stairs. The kids will help themselves,\u201d Y/n told him.</p><p>\u201cCan I really go?\u201d Venom asked.</p><p>Y/n chuckled. She disappeared back into the house and then returned with a Halloween themed bag. She held it out towards Venom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need this to collect your candy,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom took the bag from her and then took one last look back at her.</p><p>\u201cGo, I\u2019ll be right behind you,\u201d Y/n urged him.</p><p>Venom about tripped over himself as he hurried down the stairs and out into the street mingling himself with the mini-humans. Y/n only chuckled as she locked the front door behind her and took off after Venom.</p><p>Y/n watched in amusement as a group of kids took a sudden liking to Venom and quickly adopted him as one of their own. Venom stood around in awe as the kids talked his ear off and lead him house to house. The adults were too shocked or stunned in silence to say anything as his deep rough voice rang out with the high pitched voices of the kids demanding for candy.</p><p>Y/n had kind of wished that Eddie and Venom were two separate entities as it would have been nice to walk with Eddie together so the both of them could enjoy watching Venom being adopted by a pack of kids and living his best life.</p><p>But as the night went on, Venom told the kids that he would be back again trudged his way over to Y/n with his bag completely full of candy. Y/n gave him a large smile as he came to stand next to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun?\u201d Y/n asked.</p><p>\u201cSo much, can\u2019t we do this every day?\u201d Venom asked as they headed back to her house.</p><p>\u201cSorry, V, Halloween is only once a year,\u201d Y/n replied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Venom huffed.</p><p>Y/n laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry I think you\u2019ll enjoy Thanksgiving,\u201d</p><p>Venom stopped at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cCome on inside and I\u2019ll tell you all about how the end of the year has some of the biggest celebrations,\u201d Y/n said.</p><p>Venom raced inside practically running Y/n over in excitement. Y/n just laughed and rolled her eyes as she shut the door behind her so she could spend time telling Venom all about Thanksgiving and Christmas only knowing deep down that she was only opening a can of worms for Eddie, but secretly she didn\u2019t care she was looking forward to Venom\u2019s reactions for both holidays.</p>",
