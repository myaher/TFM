It\u2019s me, Diggs, and we\u2019re going to be watching the first episode of AWN\u2019s flagship project, <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Now the studio execs over at the All-Westeros Network have staked millions of stars on the success of this programme, and if you ask me, I think it\u2019s going to pay off in a tremendous way. AWN has made a name for itself with a lot of decent - though not spectacular - offerings over the past few years, but with <i>Game of Thrones</i> it seems to be really coming into its own.<br/><br/><i>Game of Thrones</i> is the first TV show to cover the period of the Second Long Night on camera with modern filming techniques such as CGI and motion-capture. It\u2019s also the first TV show to utilize both giants and dragons as models for the filming - a highly ambitious proposition, and definitely expensive as all hell. An ambitious budget for an ambitious show, indeed.<br/><br/>Our story starts at Winterfell, and was filmed on location. In fact, I believe that <i>Game of Thrones</i>\u2019 insistence on on-location filming will pay dividends - the atmosphere in those places is almost palpable. The walls of Winterfell have history behind them, and I can\u2019t wait for when the show gets to the Old Landing.<br/><br/>The first people whom we are introduced to is the Stark family - the distant ancestors of the current heads of state of the North. Now, here\u2019s another incredible thing which the casting directors got right - carbon dating and historical accounts from the time of the Second Long Night tells us that most of the Stark family actually had auburn hair, rather than the brown manes which we are so accustomed to seeing. Previous films focusing on the Second Long Night (<i>Kissed by Fire</i>, anyone?) have caught some flack from an audience increasingly concerned with historical accuracy - but no such accusations can be levelled at this production. Fully five out of eight people in the Stark family have auburn hair - the matriarch, Catelyn Tully (House Tully was almost extinguished by the Second Long Night and went extinct a few centuries later), Robb (Robert) Stark, Sansa Stark, Bran (Brandon) Stark and Rickon Stark. (And yes, I <i>am</i> counting Jon Snow as part of the family.)<br/><br/>(The most incredible thing about the casting is that they actually have an honest-to-gods Stark (as in, a Stark in real life) acting in the production. Lyanna Stark plays Arya Stark, the nine-year-old third child of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully. She\u2019s currently studying at the Winterton School of the Arts.)<br/><br/>But enough yapping, let\u2019s get right into it\u2026<br/><br/><i>#gameofthrones #stark #winterfell #lyanna-stark #westeros #second-long-night #AWN</i><br/><br/><b>493,583 notes</b><br/><br/>&mdash;&ndash;<br/><br/>Posted by <b>wildling-queen</b> at 02:39 on 8.3.1492<br/><br/>okay guys is it me or is robb stark <b><i>FUCKIGN HOT</i></b><br/><br/><i>#robb #stark #is #a #DREAMBOAT</i><br/><b><br/>69,490 notes</b><br/><br/>&mdash;&ndash;<br/><br/><b>A LEGACY OF COLONIALISM ON THE IRON ISLANDS</b><br/><br/><i>Jaesica Wormwood </i>| <i>Writer, editor, crazy cat lady - find me at jwormwood.com!</i><br/><br/>It\u2019s never truly silent on Pyke. Though the island has long been subsumed by decades of land reclamation - both prototypical and literal - there are still seams where the imported sand and soil doesn\u2019t truly take. The Holt government - almost three decades ago - decided to build canals out of these muddy, fast-moving gashes in the ground, the remnants of the ocean that dared to divide Pelagians from one another for so long. Now, pleasure boats and small cargo ships ply their trade on these routes, Braavos on a far grander scale. And yet\u2026 the aesthetic is completely different.<br/><br/>Braavos embraces freedom. Pelagia - or the Iron Islands, to use its historical, heavily loaded name - on the other hand - does not, even though it does a very good job of pretending to.<br/><br/>Did you know that the term used by folk the world over for the lands on the western shore of the Sunset Sea - Thrayk - means \u201cland of thralls\u201d? The Ironborn - Pelagians to you and I - considered these thralls slaves in all but name. They farmed and mined, and were captured by raiding. If you\u2019re in Lordsport or Westerton, look at the cobblestones beneath your feet. Look at the seaside churches of the Drowned God. Quaint, aren\u2019t they? But they were built by slave labour.<br/><br/>Over the course of their long, ignominious occupation of Thrayk, the Ironborn stole thousands of \u201cthralls\u201d from their shores. Thousands of blameless folk were shoved into the grinder and put to work developing the industries of the Iron Islands, building the ships and weaving the tapestries that the Ironborn would later sell to merchants from mainland Westeros. As part of their on-again, off-again programme of ethnic cleansing on Klandaw (formerly known as the Arbor) and Greytyde (formerly known as Bear Island), thralls were imported onto those lands to demographically overwhelm the resident population.<br/><br/>How did the Ironborn keep these people under control? The same way any slaveholding population does. As in Volantis, as in Meereen, as in Astapor, they used a mixture of terror and spare rewards to win their slavering loyalty. Volantis has apologized and paid reparations; so has Meereen and Astapor, and countless others on this side of the Narrow Sea.<br/><br/>Yet the Iron Islands has done none of that. The thralls were granted citizenship in a quiet, discreet legislative session two centuries ago; and no more was said. When Thrayk finally cast off the shackles of Ironborn occupation, Pyke resorted to more subtle means; corporations and tax codes, residency agreements and investments. Thrayk may be free, yes; but its minerals, its agriculture, its industry - those belong to the Ironborn.<br/><br/>Pyke may be bustling and loud and alive, but in all the ways that matter, it is silent as the grave.<br/><br/><b>594 Claps | 32 Responses</b><br/><br/>&mdash;&ndash;<br/><br/><b>A CRUISE THROUGH OLD VALYRIA | 8D7N</b><br/><br/>Day 1: Meet your tour guide at Blackwater Airport and embark on a ten-hour journey over the Narrow Sea, and then the Summer Sea. We will land in Alontis at roughly 13:50 Volantis time. From there, we will begin our adventure with famed tourism company <i>Smoking Seas</i>, boarding the ship of your dreams - <i>Swan 765</i>.<br/><br/><i>Swan 765</i> contains all the amenities you could possibly want - a movie theatre, a library and 24/7 Wi-Fi access, plus loanable laptops for all your personal needs. Do remember to wear protective gear when you leave the ship - the atmosphere in Valyria is highly toxic and spending more than one hour without a decent suit may give you an infection of the lungs.<br/><br/>Day 2: By this time, we would have reached the Smoking Sea proper. We will spend the day exploring the westernmost island in the Valyrian archipelago, provisionally named Major Island 1. At noon, we shall stop over at a research outpost located on the western end of the island to eat a sumptuous lunch of boiled fish and sheepshead curry - old Valyrian cuisine from when the dragonlords were but sheepherders in the mountains. At night, feel free to tour the museums of Velaryton to understand a bit more about the dragonlords and their culture.<br/><br/>Day 3: Velaryton is yours for the day. We shall visit the ruins of old Virturion, where the Valyrians conducted their most secretive research projects, followed by a light-show held by the locals. There, you will see one of the last remaining dragons in the world - Balerion, the Red Dread. Domesticated by his trainer, Melony Moors - daughter of the late Gunstram Moors - Balerion has lived for over five hundred years and shows no sign of slowing down.<br/><br/>Day 4: We will reach Major Island 2, the centerpiece of old Valyria, and immediately move inland to the city of Valyria. Valyria has been rebuilt somewhat, but the urban population remains far smaller than it was before the Doom; therefore, the rest of the city has a profoundly historical atmosphere. In the evening, we will stay at the <i>Smoky Mountain Resort</i> before embarking on a tour through the <i>Magical Kingdom</i>, built by the famed <i>Zo Disnaq Company</i>.<br/><br/>Day 5: The <i>Magical Kingdom</i> awaits. The theme park contains the largest concentration of dragons in the world as well as award-winning magicians. Visit the greyscale enclosure, where victims of the long-eradicated disease remain in their impenetrable shells. Visit the Chambers, where re-enactors and students of old Valyria play out the great dramas of that bygone age. While walking the atmospherically controlled streets of Syrax, one of the hottest neighbourhoods in the city, you might meet one of the lords freeholder on a day out on the town. For dinner, we will eat at <i>Morghon\u2019s Munchies</i>, where you will get a taste of old Valyrian butchery.<br/><br/>Day 6: Say goodbye to the <i>Magical Kingdom</i> as we set off for Major Island 3. Wild dragons are still present in the untameable climate of Major Island 3, with only one major scientific outpost. Passengers are recommended to stay indoors.<br/><br/>Day 7: We emerge into the Gulf of Grief and dock at Velos on the Isle of Cedars. Velos houses a splendid factory outlet on its outskirts containing top-notch brands from across Essos, including famed Volantene shoe brand <i>Volentino</i> and noted grunge-chic label <i>Posh Dosh</i> from the Grasslands Republic. You will have the run of the outlets until the evening; for those who don\u2019t shop, fear not! Guided tours around the city are also available, and Velosi pork is considered among the best in the world. We will set off for Blackwater Airport as night falls.<br/><br/>Day 8: We will arrive at Blackwater Airport in the late morning. See you again soon!\n\n<br/></p>",

We shall visit the ruins of old Virturion, where the Valyrians conducted their most secretive research projects, followed by a light-show held by the locals. There, you will see one of the last remaining dragons in the world - Balerion, the Red Dread. Domesticated by his trainer, Melony Moors - daughter of the late Gunstram Moors - Balerion has lived for over five hundred years and shows no sign of slowing down.<br><br>Day 4: We will reach Major Island 2, the centerpiece of old Valyria, and immediately move inland to the city of Valyria. Valyria has been rebuilt somewhat, but the urban population remains far smaller than it was before the Doom; therefore, the rest of the city has a profoundly historical atmosphere. In the evening, we will stay at the <i>Smoky Mountain Resort</i> before embarking on a tour through the <i>Magical Kingdom</i>, built by the famed <i>Zo Disnaq Company</i>.<br><br>Day 5: The <i>Magical Kingdom</i> awaits. The theme park contains the largest concentration of dragons in the world as well as award-winning magicians.

While walking the atmospherically controlled streets of Syrax, one of the hottest neighbourhoods in the city, you might meet one of the lords freeholder on a day out on the town. For dinner, we will eat at <i>Morghon\u2019s Munchies</i>, where you will get a taste of old Valyrian butchery.<br><br>Day 6: Say goodbye to the <i>Magical Kingdom</i> as we set off for Major Island 3.

You will have the run of the outlets until the evening; for those who don\u2019t shop, fear not!

It\u2019s me, Diggs, and we\u2019re going to be watching the first episode of AWN\u2019s flagship project, <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Now the studio execs over at the All-Westeros Network have staked millions of stars on the success of this programme, and if you ask me, I think it\u2019s going to pay off in a tremendous way. AWN has made a name for itself with a lot of decent - though not spectacular - offerings over the past few years, but with <i>Game of Thrones</i> it seems to be really coming into its own.<br><br><i>Game of Thrones</i> is the first TV show to cover the period of the Second Long Night on camera with modern filming techniques such as CGI and motion-capture. It\u2019s also the first TV show to utilize both giants and dragons as models for the filming - a highly ambitious proposition, and definitely expensive as all hell. An ambitious budget for an ambitious show, indeed.<br><br>Our story starts at Winterfell, and was filmed on location. In fact, I believe that <i>Game of Thrones</i>\u2019 insistence on on-location filming will pay dividends - the atmosphere in those places is almost palpable. The walls of Winterfell have history behind them, and I can\u2019t wait for when the show gets to the Old Landing.<br><br>The first people whom we are introduced to is the Stark family - the distant ancestors of the current heads of state of the North. Now, here\u2019s another incredible thing which the casting directors got right - carbon dating and historical accounts from the time of the Second Long Night tells us that most of the Stark family actually had auburn hair, rather than the brown manes which we are so accustomed to seeing. Previous films focusing on the Second Long Night (<i>Kissed by Fire</i>, anyone?) have caught some flack from an audience increasingly concerned with historical accuracy - but no such accusations can be levelled at this production. Fully five out of eight people in the Stark family have auburn hair - the matriarch, Catelyn Tully (House Tully was almost extinguished by the Second Long Night and went extinct a few centuries later), Robb (Robert) Stark, Sansa Stark, Bran (Brandon) Stark and Rickon Stark. (And yes, I <i>am</i> counting Jon Snow as part of the family.)<br><br>(The most incredible thing about the casting is that they actually have an honest-to-gods Stark (as in, a Stark in real life) acting in the production. Lyanna Stark plays Arya Stark, the nine-year-old third child of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully. She\u2019s currently studying at the Winterton School of the Arts.)<br><br>But enough yapping, let\u2019s get right into it\u2026<br><br><i>#gameofthrones #stark #winterfell #lyanna-stark #westeros #second-long-night #AWN</i><br><br><b>493,583 notes</b><br><br>\u2014\u2013<br><br>Posted by <b>wildling-queen</b> at 02:39 on 8.3.1492<br><br>okay guys is it me or is robb stark <b><i>FUCKIGN HOT</i></b><br><br><i>#robb #stark #is #a #DREAMBOAT</i><br><b><br>69,490 notes</b><br><br>\u2014\u2013<br><br><b>A LEGACY OF COLONIALISM ON THE IRON ISLANDS</b><br><br><i>Jaesica Wormwood </i>| <i>Writer, editor, crazy cat lady - find me at jwormwood.com!</i><br><br>It\u2019s never truly silent on Pyke.

But they were built by slave labour.<br><br>Over the course of their long, ignominious occupation of Thrayk, the Ironborn stole thousands of \u201cthralls\u201d from their shores.
