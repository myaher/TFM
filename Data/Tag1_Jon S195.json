        "body": "<p>Hello everyone. I\u2019m here to talk to you today about\u00a0\u2018the lowest point\u2019. The lowest point, for those of you who aren\u2019t familiar, is the darkest place in the story. The moment where everything seems hopeless because a character has failed or gone through tremendous loss or died. The lowest point is one of the most important moments in any character arc because it tests our characters. Sometimes they rise stronger than ever and sometimes they succumb to their struggles. This is often what sets apart a tragedy from a drama.</p><p>In a three act structure, the lowest point typically is placed at the 2/3 or &frac34; mark of the story. You\u2019ve probably noticed this if you\u2019ve watched a film. With 20-30 minutes left to go the characters are often crying/moping/suffering. But then it\u2019s more satisfying when we see them rise up to face the conflict in the final moments!</p><p>Now in a long ass TV show like Game of thrones, lowest points do work a bit differently. There are many lowest points throughout the season. But we can still identify each character\u2019s LOWEST lowest point and see where it is in the narrative. And the show is eight seasons, with a total of 73 episodes. So we can kiiiiinda see where the lowest point fits in by using math (*gag*)In this way, we can predict what that says for each character in their final season of Game of Thrones.</p><p>So, the remaining Starks (Jon, Sansa, Arya and Bran) actually all have their lowest point at around the same place, which is thematically satisfying. Obviously the Starks have had MANY low moments, but we\u2019re looking for the LOWEST of the low.</p><p>Sansa, for instance, is a character with many rough moments.\nBut while Joffery is awful, her marriage to Ramsay is unquestionably her lowest\npoint. She has been constantly losing her identity as a Stark to marriage but this is the very worst instance. This happens in season five and culminates with her being willing to throw herself off the wall of Winterfell on the off chance she might survive. Her lowest point happens roughly 2/3 of the way through the show because of that.</p><p>Arya also is a character of many\nbad moments from witnessing her father\u2019s death to the red wedding! But her lowest point is when she begins to lose her very identity as a Stark in season five and six. Her loss of vision is what kick starts that lowest point at the end of season five. Roughly 2/3 of the way through the story.\u00a0</p><p>Jon lost his lover Ygritte which was sad, but his lowest point is when he\nDIES at, you guessed it, the end of season five. 2/3 of the way through the story. Worse than that he is BETRAYED for doing something he thought was right!</p><p>Bran is the only Stark who\u2019s lowest point occurs in season six instead, when he surrenders himself to beoming the three eyed raven and the old Bran seems to\u00a0\u201cdie\u201d. But Bran wasn\u2019t in season five at all, so if we just take the seasons he IS in, then his lowest point occurs around the &frac34; point of his story, so not too far off.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the Starks who have a lowest point at the end of season five! So does Cersei! Her walk of shame marks her most emotionally vulnerable and awful moment and therefore occurs 2/3 of the way through the story. Losing her son was of course, awful, but this attacks her very sense of self. Again, often times the lowest point is not someone you love dying but when you start to lose all sense of who you are.</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s lowest point is when he kills Shae and then his father. It occurs about half way through the story, so he\u2019s set apart from the other five we\u2019ve discussed here. He has tried so hard to be accepted by his family, so hard to prove his innocence, so hard to get his father\u2019s approval. And this is the moment when he says FUCK it. He becomes a Kinslayer and he leaves King\u2019s Landing in a box. He, at the time, seems to have forfeited the game. It\u2019s no coincidence that the next time we see him he is drinking like its the end of the world. A lowest point at the half way mark is unconventional, but sort of makes sense in a TV show. There is Tyrion BEFORE he killed his father and there is Tyrion AFTER he killed his father. He is forever changed now.</p><p>But some characters have a lowest point that\u2019s even FURTHER back. Let\u2019s check out Jaime and Theon. They both have their lowest point in season three and&hellip;man&hellip;could it have to do with a loss of self? Hell yeah it does!</p><p>Jaime loses his hand in episode three of season three, about 1/3 of the way through the story. It is stated many times that his LIFE was in that hand. His sword hand. That has always been the one thing he KNEW he could do better than anyone. With that gone he has nothing. He doesn\u2019t know who he is so he must figure it out again from scratch. And he takes a kind of long time to figure it out but we\u2019ll circle back to Jaime in a sec.</p><p>Theon SUPER loses his identity through awful torture until he goes only by the name of Reek. His lowest point kind of lasts awhile, but I\u2019d say the end of season three where he first abandoned his name, marks the true lowest point. A little over 1/3 of the way through the series. And he, like Jaime, takes a long time to rediscover it.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Daenerys. Do you know when her lowest point happens? Her LOWEST lowest point?</p><p>It\u2019s season one.</p><p>Now, Daenerys has had other lowest points of course. Locking away her dragons, being picked up by the Dothraki, losing Viseron. But none of them have been quite so intense as her season one loss. Toward the end of season one, Dany has finaly been coming into power, free from her brother. She has a plan to cross the sea and take back her throne! And she has an army willing to take her there! And, even better, she\u2019s pregnant with a son who she already loves!</p><p>But then, in a very short span of time she loses her husband, her son and all of her armies. She is left with only a few scattered followers and she walks into a fire with the dragon eggs. At this point, her surviving or the dragons hatching is not a sure thing. This, for Daenerys, is a sort of desperate act to try to retain SOMETHING of the power she had only a few days previous. Fortunately for her&hellip;it results in dragons.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about the results of the lowest point real quick. The lowest point isn\u2019t just there to make a character suffer. It\u2019s there to mold them and push them along their arc. It\u2019s there to make them stronger. So how does the lowest point effect each character? Well, Jon is brought back from the dead, escaping his lowest point. And with that, he is actually able to fight for his family again&ndash;the family he always wanted to be a part of. He, as a result, becomes King in the North. But he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if not for being knifed through the heart. On a personal level thought&hellip;he\u2019s more jaded but also more focused than ever on the true threat. The Night King must be stopped. It is the only way to save everyone.</p><p>Sansa, after enduring abuse after abuse, is tired of other people deciding her fate for her. Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger, Ramsay. They\u2019ve all used her for their own means. She wants to take back Winterfell, with Jon, so they can be safe. That is Sansa\u2019s main desire at this point. Safety. And she will do anything to ensure it. The reason why its so satisfying to see her face Ramsay and tell him to\u00a0\u201csleep well\u201d is because she is no longer letting anyone have control over her. She\u2019s done with that. She as become harder and smarter.</p><p>Arya, after having her eyes taken, must of course learn to use her other senses and endure physical abuse from the waif. So she gets stronger. But the real struggle here is for her identity. All throughout the arc, there\u2019s this thread that she can\u2019t let go of Needle. It\u2019s what Jon gave her! Its her last piece of herself! And by the end, instead of letting herself be killed or giving up on Arya Stark, she takes Needle and kills the waif before declaring\u00a0\u201ca girl is Arya Stark and I am going home\u201d. Perhaps she has lost everything&hellip; but she will not give up her name or her family.</p><p>Bran, interestingly, is sort of still in his lowest point. He has become the three eyed raven and at this point it is uncertain whether or not he will find himself again or whether, as Mira says, he died in that cave. That question will surely be answered in Season 8.</p><p>Cersei, in response to being shamed&hellip;fucks up EVERYONE. She blows up the sept with the faith as well as Margaery and becomes queen of the Seven Kingdoms. They brought her low and she climbed higher than ever. But this is also at a tragic cost. She loses her final child and thus becomes colder than ever. Cersei\u2019s story is a tragedy after all, so there is never TRUE triumph for her.</p><p>Now, Jaime and Theon are frustrating character, partially because they have to be made, unmade and reborn. And that takes time. In season one and two, they both kind of suck. Jaime sucks most in season one and Theon most in season two. Then, through a dramatic, traumatic event they lose themselves and are left wandering in the dark. Jaime TRIES to return to buisness as usual as a King\u2019s Guard, but finds himself more distant from Cersei as she too is changed. And he fails to protect TWO of his children, which leaves him feeling more lost. But really, he\u2019s stuck with the person who brings out the worst in him, clinging to the past that he had with her until he FINALLY realizes that its over and leaves her at the end of season seven.</p><p>Theon spends quite a bit of time as Reek, likewise, and even though he escapes Ramsay at the end of season five, he still is left with the fear of him and the trauma that losing himself inflicted. For THREE WHOLE SEASONS he was with Ramsay, and that has been traumatic. So season six and seven focus on him still not truly being Theon anymore. Now, at the end of season seven, he has finally claimed his name again, bathed himself in water (reborn) and is ready to save his sister.</p><p>Jaime and Theon are both frustrating characters because we WANT to see them embrace their new selves but it takes them awhile to do so. The Starks are easier to get behind because their reaction to their lowest point is more immediate whereas Jaime and Theon stall for a bit before finally getting it. It is frustrating but like&hellip;it\u2019s also relatable in a way.</p><p>And then, back to Daenerys. Daenerys, as I mentioned, comes out of her lowest point with three dragons. By the end of season two, she has money. By the end of season three, she has an army. By the beginning of season four, she has Mereen. By the end of season five she has figured out how to ride her dragon and she has new advisors in Varys and Tyrion. By the end of season six she has the dothraki in addition to her other armies, a bunch of allies, and is ready to sail for Westeros.</p><p>There are lowest points interspersed in these developments, but over all, she has continued to gain more and more ever sense her lowest point. As her dragons get bigger so does her power. Now, some of that power has wavered as she lost allies in Westeros and now the threat of the dead is coming&hellip;but the fact that we haven\u2019t seen Dany lower than the end of season one? That has implications for season eight. So what are those implications?</p><p>Of the remaining major characters, I think Jon, Sansa, Bran and Theon have already hit their LOWEST lowest point.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a toss up for me.</p><p>Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys have yet to hit their true lowest point.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ll explain. For Jon, he has already died, and even if he dies again&hellip;that\u2019s not really hitting a lowest point. If anything, the second time he dies, it will be after completeing his mission and therefore less devestating than the first time. He certainly won\u2019t die via betrayal this time. And, best case scenario, he lives! But this is Game of Thrones after all.</p><p>For Sansa and Theon&hellip;I really don\u2019t think it can get worse than Ramsay. Even if shitty things happen to them, there\u2019s just&hellip;no sinking any lower than that.</p><p>For Bran, he\u2019s still in the midst of dealing with his other lowest point so his fate in season eight will sort of be&hellip;a reaction that that.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a tossup for me because it kind of depends. If Arya, at any point, chooses vengeance over family, I suspect she will hit a new and tragic lowest point. If not, I think she\u2019s good. For Tyrion, I\u2019m hazy enough on his motives right now, there is a possibility that he will hit a lower point.</p><p>But then there\u2019s Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys. Cersei\u2019s whole life has been barrelling toward this self fulfilling prophesy. And if Jaime is indeed going to be her killer, the realization of that will fucking SHATTER her right before she dies as she realizes that she has been so blind.</p><p>For Jaime, the lowest point will likely be Cersei\u2019s death. If his hand was part of his identity, she was another part. Now of course, I\u2019m the biggest Jaime x Brienne shipper in the world and I DO THINK at this point he has left Cersei behind. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t going to be a kick in the balls when she dies (especially if he does it).</p><p>And then Daenerys. For a long time, its been a journey up for Dany. Ever since season one she has been rising. What\u2019s the saying? The higher you go, the further you fall? I don\u2019t know what form Dany\u2019s lowest point will take, but I am fairly sure this season is going to be ROUGH for her and will probably have something to do with her sense of self as a Targaryen (since many of the true lowest points have looked at personal identity). On a narrative level, its been too long since the LOWEST lowest point, and its probs going to happen here.</p><p>Anyway, just a little story analysis I was thinking about this morning. Let me know what you think the season 8 lowest points will be! As always, keep discussion respectful :)</p>",

And, even better, she\u2019s pregnant with a son who she already loves!</p><p>But then, in a very short span of time she loses her husband, her son and all of her armies. She is left with only a few scattered followers and she walks into a fire with the dragon eggs. At this point, her surviving or the dragons hatching is not a sure thing. This, for Daenerys, is a sort of desperate act to try to retain SOMETHING of the power she had only a few days previous. Fortunately for her\u2026it results in dragons.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about the results of the lowest point real quick. The lowest point isn\u2019t just there to make a character suffer. It\u2019s there to mold them and push them along their arc. It\u2019s there to make them stronger. So how does the lowest point effect each character? Well, Jon is brought back from the dead, escaping his lowest point. And with that, he is actually able to fight for his family again\u2013the family he always wanted to be a part of. He, as a result, becomes King in the North. But he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if not for being knifed through the heart. On a personal level thought\u2026he\u2019s more jaded but also more focused than ever on the true threat. The Night King must be stopped. It is the only way to save everyone.</p><p>Sansa, after enduring abuse after abuse, is tired of other people deciding her fate for her. Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger, Ramsay. They\u2019ve all used her for their own means. She wants to take back Winterfell, with Jon, so they can be safe. That is Sansa\u2019s main desire at this point. Safety. And she will do anything to ensure it. The reason why its so satisfying to see her face Ramsay and tell him to\u00a0\u201csleep well\u201d is because she is no longer letting anyone have control over her. She\u2019s done with that. She as become harder and smarter.</p><p>Arya, after having her eyes taken, must of course learn to use her other senses and endure physical abuse from the waif. So she gets stronger. But the real struggle here is for her identity. All throughout the arc, there\u2019s this thread that she can\u2019t let go of Needle. It\u2019s what Jon gave her! Its her last piece of herself! And by the end, instead of letting herself be killed or giving up on Arya Stark, she takes Needle and kills the waif before declaring\u00a0\u201ca girl is Arya Stark and I am going home\u201d. Perhaps she has lost everything\u2026 but she will not give up her name or her family.</p><p>Bran, interestingly, is sort of still in his lowest point. He has become the three eyed raven and at this point it is uncertain whether or not he will find himself again or whether, as Mira says, he died in that cave. That question will surely be answered in Season 8.</p><p>Cersei, in response to being shamed\u2026fucks up EVERYONE. She blows up the sept with the faith as well as Margaery and becomes queen of the Seven Kingdoms. They brought her low and she climbed higher than ever. But this is also at a tragic cost. She loses her final child and thus becomes colder than ever. Cersei\u2019s story is a tragedy after all, so there is never TRUE triumph for her.</p><p>Now, Jaime and Theon are frustrating character, partially because they have to be made, unmade and reborn. And that takes time. In season one and two, they both kind of suck. Jaime sucks most in season one and Theon most in season two. Then, through a dramatic, traumatic event they lose themselves and are left wandering in the dark. Jaime TRIES to return to buisness as usual as a King\u2019s Guard, but finds himself more distant from Cersei as she too is changed. And he fails to protect TWO of his children, which leaves him feeling more lost. But really, he\u2019s stuck with the person who brings out the worst in him, clinging to the past that he had with her until he FINALLY realizes that its over and leaves her at the end of season seven.</p><p>Theon spends quite a bit of time as Reek, likewise, and even though he escapes Ramsay at the end of season five, he still is left with the fear of him and the trauma that losing himself inflicted. For THREE WHOLE SEASONS he was with Ramsay, and that has been traumatic. So season six and seven focus on him still not truly being Theon anymore. Now, at the end of season seven, he has finally claimed his name again, bathed himself in water (reborn) and is ready to save his sister.</p><p>Jaime and Theon are both frustrating characters because we WANT to see them embrace their new selves but it takes them awhile to do so. The Starks are easier to get behind because their reaction to their lowest point is more immediate whereas Jaime and Theon stall for a bit before finally getting it. It is frustrating but like\u2026it\u2019s also relatable in a way.</p><p>And then, back to Daenerys. Daenerys, as I mentioned, comes out of her lowest point with three dragons. By the end of season two, she has money. By the end of season three, she has an army. By the beginning of season four, she has Mereen. By the end of season five she has figured out how to ride her dragon and she has new advisors in Varys and Tyrion. By the end of season six she has the dothraki in addition to her other armies, a bunch of allies, and is ready to sail for Westeros.</p><p>There are lowest points interspersed in these developments, but over all, she has continued to gain more and more ever sense her lowest point. As her dragons get bigger so does her power. Now, some of that power has wavered as she lost allies in Westeros and now the threat of the dead is coming\u2026but the fact that we haven\u2019t seen Dany lower than the end of season one? That has implications for season eight. So what are those implications?</p><p>Of the remaining major characters, I think Jon, Sansa, Bran and Theon have already hit their LOWEST lowest point.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a toss up for me.</p><p>Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys have yet to hit their true lowest point.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019ll explain. For Jon, he has already died, and even if he dies again\u2026that\u2019s not really hitting a lowest point. If anything, the second time he dies, it will be after completeing his mission and therefore less devestating than the first time. He certainly won\u2019t die via betrayal this time. And, best case scenario, he lives! But this is Game of Thrones after all.</p><p>For Sansa and Theon\u2026I really don\u2019t think it can get worse than Ramsay. Even if shitty things happen to them, there\u2019s just\u2026no sinking any lower than that.</p><p>For Bran, he\u2019s still in the midst of dealing with his other lowest point so his fate in season eight will sort of be\u2026a reaction that that.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a tossup for me because it kind of depends. If Arya, at any point, chooses vengeance over family, I suspect she will hit a new and tragic lowest point. If not, I think she\u2019s good. For Tyrion, I\u2019m hazy enough on his motives right now, there is a possibility that he will hit a lower point.</p><p>But then there\u2019s Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys. Cersei\u2019s whole life has been barrelling toward this self fulfilling prophesy. And if Jaime is indeed going to be her killer, the realization of that will fucking SHATTER her right before she dies as she realizes that she has been so blind.</p><p>For Jaime, the lowest point will likely be Cersei\u2019s death. If his hand was part of his identity, she was another part. Now of course, I\u2019m the biggest Jaime x Brienne shipper in the world and I DO THINK at this point he has left Cersei behind. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t going to be a kick in the balls when she dies (especially if he does it).</p><p>And then Daenerys. For a long time, its been a journey up for Dany. Ever since season one she has been rising. What\u2019s the saying? The higher you go, the further you fall? I don\u2019t know what form Dany\u2019s lowest point will take, but I am fairly sure this season is going to be ROUGH for her and will probably have something to do with her sense of self as a Targaryen (since many of the true lowest points have looked at personal identity). On a narrative level, its been too long since the LOWEST lowest point, and its probs going to happen here.</p><p>Anyway, just a little story analysis I was thinking about this morning. Let me know what you think the season 8 lowest points will be! As always, keep discussion respectful :)</p>",

                "content_raw": "<p>Hello everyone. I\u2019m here to talk to you today about\u00a0\u2018the lowest point\u2019. The lowest point, for those of you who aren\u2019t familiar, is the darkest place in the story. The moment where everything seems hopeless because a character has failed or gone through tremendous loss or died. The lowest point is one of the most important moments in any character arc because it tests our characters. Sometimes they rise stronger than ever and sometimes they succumb to their struggles. This is often what sets apart a tragedy from a drama.</p><p>In a three act structure, the lowest point typically is placed at the 2/3 or \u00be mark of the story. You\u2019ve probably noticed this if you\u2019ve watched a film. With 20-30 minutes left to go the characters are often crying/moping/suffering. But then it\u2019s more satisfying when we see them rise up to face the conflict in the final moments!</p><p>Now in a long ass TV show like Game of thrones, lowest points do work a bit differently. There are many lowest points throughout the season. But we can still identify each character\u2019s LOWEST lowest point and see where it is in the narrative. And the show is eight seasons, with a total of 73 episodes. So we can kiiiiinda see where the lowest point fits in by using math (*gag*)In this way, we can predict what that says for each character in their final season of Game of Thrones.</p><p>So, the remaining Starks (Jon, Sansa, Arya and Bran) actually all have their lowest point at around the same place, which is thematically satisfying. Obviously the Starks have had MANY low moments, but we\u2019re looking for the LOWEST of the low.</p><p>Sansa, for instance, is a character with many rough moments.\nBut while Joffery is awful, her marriage to Ramsay is unquestionably her lowest\npoint. She has been constantly losing her identity as a Stark to marriage but this is the very worst instance. This happens in season five and culminates with her being willing to throw herself off the wall of Winterfell on the off chance she might survive. Her lowest point happens roughly 2/3 of the way through the show because of that.</p><p>Arya also is a character of many\nbad moments from witnessing her father\u2019s death to the red wedding! But her lowest point is when she begins to lose her very identity as a Stark in season five and six. Her loss of vision is what kick starts that lowest point at the end of season five. Roughly 2/3 of the way through the story.\u00a0</p><p>Jon lost his lover Ygritte which was sad, but his lowest point is when he\nDIES at, you guessed it, the end of season five. 2/3 of the way through the story. Worse than that he is BETRAYED for doing something he thought was right!</p><p>Bran is the only Stark who\u2019s lowest point occurs in season six instead, when he surrenders himself to beoming the three eyed raven and the old Bran seems to\u00a0\u201cdie\u201d. But Bran wasn\u2019t in season five at all, so if we just take the seasons he IS in, then his lowest point occurs around the \u00be point of his story, so not too far off.</p><p>It\u2019s not just the Starks who have a lowest point at the end of season five! So does Cersei! Her walk of shame marks her most emotionally vulnerable and awful moment and therefore occurs 2/3 of the way through the story. Losing her son was of course, awful, but this attacks her very sense of self. Again, often times the lowest point is not someone you love dying but when you start to lose all sense of who you are.</p><p>Tyrion\u2019s lowest point is when he kills Shae and then his father. It occurs about half way through the story, so he\u2019s set apart from the other five we\u2019ve discussed here. He has tried so hard to be accepted by his family, so hard to prove his innocence, so hard to get his father\u2019s approval. And this is the moment when he says FUCK it. He becomes a Kinslayer and he leaves King\u2019s Landing in a box. He, at the time, seems to have forfeited the game. It\u2019s no coincidence that the next time we see him he is drinking like its the end of the world. A lowest point at the half way mark is unconventional, but sort of makes sense in a TV show. There is Tyrion BEFORE he killed his father and there is Tyrion AFTER he killed his father. He is forever changed now.</p><p>But some characters have a lowest point that\u2019s even FURTHER back. Let\u2019s check out Jaime and Theon. They both have their lowest point in season three and\u2026man\u2026could it have to do with a loss of self? Hell yeah it does!</p><p>Jaime loses his hand in episode three of season three, about 1/3 of the way through the story. It is stated many times that his LIFE was in that hand. His sword hand. That has always been the one thing he KNEW he could do better than anyone. With that gone he has nothing. He doesn\u2019t know who he is so he must figure it out again from scratch. And he takes a kind of long time to figure it out but we\u2019ll circle back to Jaime in a sec.</p><p>Theon SUPER loses his identity through awful torture until he goes only by the name of Reek. His lowest point kind of lasts awhile, but I\u2019d say the end of season three where he first abandoned his name, marks the true lowest point. A little over 1/3 of the way through the series. And he, like Jaime, takes a long time to rediscover it.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Daenerys. Do you know when her lowest point happens? Her LOWEST lowest point?</p><p>It\u2019s season one.</p><p>Now, Daenerys has had other lowest points of course. Locking away her dragons, being picked up by the Dothraki, losing Viseron. But none of them have been quite so intense as her season one loss. Toward the end of season one, Dany has finaly been coming into power, free from her brother. She has a plan to cross the sea and take back her throne! And she has an army willing to take her there! And, even better, she\u2019s pregnant with a son who she already loves!</p><p>But then, in a very short span of time she loses her husband, her son and all of her armies. She is left with only a few scattered followers and she walks into a fire with the dragon eggs. At this point, her surviving or the dragons hatching is not a sure thing. This, for Daenerys, is a sort of desperate act to try to retain SOMETHING of the power she had only a few days previous. Fortunately for her\u2026it results in dragons.</p><p>Let\u2019s talk about the results of the lowest point real quick. The lowest point isn\u2019t just there to make a character suffer. It\u2019s there to mold them and push them along their arc. It\u2019s there to make them stronger. So how does the lowest point effect each character? Well, Jon is brought back from the dead, escaping his lowest point. And with that, he is actually able to fight for his family again\u2013the family he always wanted to be a part of. He, as a result, becomes King in the North. But he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if not for being knifed through the heart. On a personal level thought\u2026he\u2019s more jaded but also more focused than ever on the true threat. The Night King must be stopped.

And she will do anything to ensure it. The reason why its so satisfying to see her face Ramsay and tell him to\u00a0\u201csleep well\u201d is because she is no longer letting anyone have control over her. She\u2019s done with that. She as become harder and smarter.</p><p>Arya, after having her eyes taken, must of course learn to use her other senses and endure physical abuse from the waif. So she gets stronger. But the real struggle here is for her identity. All throughout the arc, there\u2019s this thread that she can\u2019t let go of Needle. It\u2019s what Jon gave her! Its her last piece of herself! And by the end, instead of letting herself be killed or giving up on Arya Stark, she takes Needle and kills the waif before declaring\u00a0\u201ca girl is Arya Stark and I am going home\u201d. Perhaps she has lost everything\u2026 but she will not give up her name or her family.</p><p>Bran, interestingly, is sort of still in his lowest point. He has become the three eyed raven and at this point it is uncertain whether or not he will find himself again or whether, as Mira says, he died in that cave. That question will surely be answered in Season 8.</p><p>Cersei, in response to being shamed\u2026fucks up EVERYONE. She blows up the sept with the faith as well as Margaery and becomes queen of the Seven Kingdoms. They brought her low and she climbed higher than ever. But this is also at a tragic cost. She loses her final child and thus becomes colder than ever.

For THREE WHOLE SEASONS he was with Ramsay, and that has been traumatic. So season six and seven focus on him still not truly being Theon anymore.

But Bran wasn&rsquo;t in season five at all, so if we just take the seasons he IS in, then his lowest point occurs around the &frac34; point of his story, so not too far off.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just the Starks who have a lowest point at the end of season five! So does Cersei! Her walk of shame marks her most emotionally vulnerable and awful moment and therefore occurs 2/3 of the way through the story. Losing her son was of course, awful, but this attacks her very sense of self. Again, often times the lowest point is not someone you love dying but when you start to lose all sense of who you are.</p><p>Tyrion&rsquo;s lowest point is when he kills Shae and then his father. It occurs about half way through the story, so he&rsquo;s set apart from the other five we&rsquo;ve discussed here. He has tried so hard to be accepted by his family, so hard to prove his innocence, so hard to get his father&rsquo;s approval. And this is the moment when he says FUCK it. He becomes a Kinslayer and he leaves King&rsquo;s Landing in a box. He, at the time, seems to have forfeited the game. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the next time we see him he is drinking like its the end of the world. A lowest point at the half way mark is unconventional, but sort of makes sense in a TV show. There is Tyrion BEFORE he killed his father and there is Tyrion AFTER he killed his father. He is forever changed now.</p><p>But some characters have a lowest point that&rsquo;s even FURTHER back. Let&rsquo;s check out Jaime and Theon. They both have their lowest point in season three and&hellip;man&hellip;could it have to do with a loss of self? Hell yeah it does!</p><p>Jaime loses his hand in episode three of season three, about 1/3 of the way through the story. It is stated many times that his LIFE was in that hand. His sword hand. That has always been the one thing he KNEW he could do better than anyone. With that gone he has nothing. He doesn&rsquo;t know who he is so he must figure it out again from scratch. And he takes a kind of long time to figure it out but we&rsquo;ll circle back to Jaime in a sec.</p><p>Theon SUPER loses his identity through awful torture until he goes only by the name of Reek. His lowest point kind of lasts awhile, but I&rsquo;d say the end of season three where he first abandoned his name, marks the true lowest point. A little over 1/3 of the way through the series. And he, like Jaime, takes a long time to rediscover it.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s Daenerys. Do you know when her lowest point happens? Her LOWEST lowest point?</p><p>It&rsquo;s season one.</p><p>Now, Daenerys has had other lowest points of course. Locking away her dragons, being picked up by the Dothraki, losing Viseron. But none of them have been quite so intense as her season one loss. Toward the end of season one, Dany has finaly been coming into power, free from her brother. She has a plan to cross the sea and take back her throne! And she has an army willing to take her there! And, even better, she&rsquo;s pregnant with a son who she already loves!</p><p>But then, in a very short span of time she loses her husband, her son and all of her armies. She is left with only a few scattered followers and she walks into a fire with the dragon eggs. At this point, her surviving or the dragons hatching is not a sure thing. This, for Daenerys, is a sort of desperate act to try to retain SOMETHING of the power she had only a few days previous. Fortunately for her&hellip;it results in dragons.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the results of the lowest point real quick. The lowest point isn&rsquo;t just there to make a character suffer. It&rsquo;s there to mold them and push them along their arc. It&rsquo;s there to make them stronger. So how does the lowest point effect each character? Well, Jon is brought back from the dead, escaping his lowest point. And with that, he is actually able to fight for his family again&ndash;the family he always wanted to be a part of. He, as a result, becomes King in the North. But he wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do that if not for being knifed through the heart. On a personal level thought&hellip;he&rsquo;s more jaded but also more focused than ever on the true threat. The Night King must be stopped. It is the only way to save everyone.</p><p>Sansa, after enduring abuse after abuse, is tired of other people deciding her fate for her. Cersei, Joffrey, Littlefinger, Ramsay. They&rsquo;ve all used her for their own means. She wants to take back Winterfell, with Jon, so they can be safe. That is Sansa&rsquo;s main desire at this point. Safety. And she will do anything to ensure it. The reason why its so satisfying to see her face Ramsay and tell him to&nbsp;&ldquo;sleep well&rdquo; is because she is no longer letting anyone have control over her. She&rsquo;s done with that. She as become harder and smarter.</p><p>Arya, after having her eyes taken, must of course learn to use her other senses and endure physical abuse from the waif. So she gets stronger. But the real struggle here is for her identity. All throughout the arc, there&rsquo;s this thread that she can&rsquo;t let go of Needle. It&rsquo;s what Jon gave her! Its her last piece of herself! And by the end, instead of letting herself be killed or giving up on Arya Stark, she takes Needle and kills the waif before declaring&nbsp;&ldquo;a girl is Arya Stark and I am going home&rdquo;. Perhaps she has lost everything&hellip; but she will not give up her name or her family.</p><p>Bran, interestingly, is sort of still in his lowest point. He has become the three eyed raven and at this point it is uncertain whether or not he will find himself again or whether, as Mira says, he died in that cave. That question will surely be answered in Season 8.</p><p>Cersei, in response to being shamed&hellip;fucks up EVERYONE. She blows up the sept with the faith as well as Margaery and becomes queen of the Seven Kingdoms. They brought her low and she climbed higher than ever. But this is also at a tragic cost. She loses her final child and thus becomes colder than ever. Cersei&rsquo;s story is a tragedy after all, so there is never TRUE triumph for her.</p><p>Now, Jaime and Theon are frustrating character, partially because they have to be made, unmade and reborn. And that takes time. In season one and two, they both kind of suck. Jaime sucks most in season one and Theon most in season two. Then, through a dramatic, traumatic event they lose themselves and are left wandering in the dark. Jaime TRIES to return to buisness as usual as a King&rsquo;s Guard, but finds himself more distant from Cersei as she too is changed. And he fails to protect TWO of his children, which leaves him feeling more lost. But really, he&rsquo;s stuck with the person who brings out the worst in him, clinging to the past that he had with her until he FINALLY realizes that its over and leaves her at the end of season seven.</p><p>Theon spends quite a bit of time as Reek, likewise, and even though he escapes Ramsay at the end of season five, he still is left with the fear of him and the trauma that losing himself inflicted. For THREE WHOLE SEASONS he was with Ramsay, and that has been traumatic. So season six and seven focus on him still not truly being Theon anymore. Now, at the end of season seven, he has finally claimed his name again, bathed himself in water (reborn) and is ready to save his sister.</p><p>Jaime and Theon are both frustrating characters because we WANT to see them embrace their new selves but it takes them awhile to do so. The Starks are easier to get behind because their reaction to their lowest point is more immediate whereas Jaime and Theon stall for a bit before finally getting it. It is frustrating but like&hellip;it&rsquo;s also relatable in a way.</p><p>And then, back to Daenerys. Daenerys, as I mentioned, comes out of her lowest point with three dragons. By the end of season two, she has money. By the end of season three, she has an army. By the beginning of season four, she has Mereen. By the end of season five she has figured out how to ride her dragon and she has new advisors in Varys and Tyrion. By the end of season six she has the dothraki in addition to her other armies, a bunch of allies, and is ready to sail for Westeros.</p><p>There are lowest points interspersed in these developments, but over all, she has continued to gain more and more ever sense her lowest point. As her dragons get bigger so does her power. Now, some of that power has wavered as she lost allies in Westeros and now the threat of the dead is coming&hellip;but the fact that we haven&rsquo;t seen Dany lower than the end of season one? That has implications for season eight. So what are those implications?</p><p>Of the remaining major characters, I think Jon, Sansa, Bran and Theon have already hit their LOWEST lowest point.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a toss up for me.</p><p>Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys have yet to hit their true lowest point.&nbsp;</p><p>I&rsquo;ll explain. For Jon, he has already died, and even if he dies again&hellip;that&rsquo;s not really hitting a lowest point. If anything, the second time he dies, it will be after completeing his mission and therefore less devestating than the first time. He certainly won&rsquo;t die via betrayal this time. And, best case scenario, he lives! But this is Game of Thrones after all.</p><p>For Sansa and Theon&hellip;I really don&rsquo;t think it can get worse than Ramsay. Even if shitty things happen to them, there&rsquo;s just&hellip;no sinking any lower than that.</p><p>For Bran, he&rsquo;s still in the midst of dealing with his other lowest point so his fate in season eight will sort of be&hellip;a reaction that that.</p><p>Arya and Tyrion are a tossup for me because it kind of depends. If Arya, at any point, chooses vengeance over family, I suspect she will hit a new and tragic lowest point. If not, I think she&rsquo;s good. For Tyrion, I&rsquo;m hazy enough on his motives right now, there is a possibility that he will hit a lower point.</p><p>But then there&rsquo;s Cersei, Jaime and Daenerys. Cersei&rsquo;s whole life has been barrelling toward this self fulfilling prophesy. And if Jaime is indeed going to be her killer, the realization of that will fucking SHATTER her right before she dies as she realizes that she has been so blind.</p><p>For Jaime, the lowest point will likely be Cersei&rsquo;s death. If his hand was part of his identity, she was another part. Now of course, I&rsquo;m the biggest Jaime x Brienne shipper in the world and I DO THINK at this point he has left Cersei behind. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t going to be a kick in the balls when she dies (especially if he does it).</p><p>And then Daenerys. For a long time, its been a journey up for Dany. Ever since season one she has been rising. What&rsquo;s the saying? The higher you go, the further you fall? I don&rsquo;t know what form Dany&rsquo;s lowest point will take, but I am fairly sure this season is going to be ROUGH for her and will probably have something to do with her sense of self as a Targaryen (since many of the true lowest points have looked at personal identity). On a narrative level, its been too long since the LOWEST lowest point, and its probs going to happen here.</p><p>Anyway, just a little story analysis I was thinking about this morning. Let me know what you think the season 8 lowest points will be! As always, keep discussion respectful :)</p>",
