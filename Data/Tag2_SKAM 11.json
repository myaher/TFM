No but basically, what we can see in s3 is that Eliott has several ways to flirt. At the start he has one a bit more delicate, I&rsquo;d call that &ldquo;allusive flirting&rdquo;. That is to say that he&rsquo;s making a lot of little innuendos, he&rsquo;s throwing hints like that, i&rsquo;m especially thinking about&hellip;</p><p>Max : &ldquo;Not necessarily a girl&rdquo;? (bitch is this allusive for you???) </p><!-- more --><p>J : Yeah, that scene! Where he walks with Lucas</p><p>Max : At that point he attacks</p><p>A : I admit!</p><p>J : Yeah but actually, he attacks but at the same time is that really clear? because frankly, me, you tell me something like this&hellip; Maybe I would tell myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m imagining things&rdquo;, isn&rsquo;t it a bit too cryptic? (okay i&rsquo;m waiting can someone please start being eliott-cryptic with me)</p><p>Mar : You&rsquo;re replacing his hair also [here&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a confusion cause what she says (&ldquo;tu lui redresses l'\u00e9pi&rdquo;) sounds like &ldquo;tu lui redresses les pieds&rdquo; = you&rsquo;re straightening his feet]</p><p>Max : I&rsquo;m straightening his feet??</p><p>Mar : You&rsquo;re replacing his hair</p><p>Max : Oh his hair!</p><p>A : Oh yeah, yeah right!!</p><p>Max : But this is to know how to draw him, it&rsquo;s not a flirting technique, you see&hellip;</p><p>O : He wants to draw him to flirt with him</p><p>J : No but there&rsquo;s that and there&rsquo;s all the piano scene (my dudes if that&rsquo;s being allusive to you how the fuck do you usually flirt)&hellip; He&rsquo;s super intense in fact, Eliott.</p><p>A : Even in the look in his eyes. You have a look in your eyes, it&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s intense!</p><p>A : Like you see everything in his eyes, you&rsquo;re telling yourself, fuck that&rsquo;s crazy what are you thinking about to&hellip;? We would love to get into your head, like it&rsquo;s&hellip;. Really.</p><p>J : So the Eliott way, a bit cryptic like that, is it working on you or not? Or do you flirt like that? Are you practicing allusive flirting?</p><p>Max : No, Eliottesque!</p><p>J : I don&rsquo;t even know if that exists, I may have used all along a term that doesn&rsquo;t exist, but&hellip;</p><p>A : It wouldn&rsquo;t work on me.</p><p>J : You wouldn&rsquo;t understand</p><p>A : Actually, even if i did understand, you need to be straight forward. You have to tell me things straight, you have to tell be things clearly, if you&rsquo;re not clear I won&rsquo;t mind you. So, yeah.</p><p>O : That&rsquo;s a Basile</p><p>A : totally! And you know that when I did the Serieously test I got Basile? Serieously did a test on instagram where you answer a quiz and in the end you get a character from the gang, and i got Basile.</p><p>Max : I got Yann (oh same i think) </p><p>J : Yeah you&rsquo;re more Basile, well Basile is a bit heavy in s3, even tho he&rsquo;s kinda cute, but he&rsquo;s still annoying</p><p>A : Yeah he&rsquo;s still heavy</p><p>J : At least you understand!</p><p>A : Yeah no we understand but, right, not heavy like that</p><p>Max : You&rsquo;re gonna start getting hit on by guys that are gonna be like&hellip;</p><p>J : True be careful, cause really some people take everything really literally.</p><p>O : Still, Basile is cute.</p><p>A : He&rsquo;s too cute! I like Basile, I like his character</p><p>O : Especially what he tells Daphn\u00e9 at some point, so cute, like at the end of s3 he tells her &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m annoying, but i&rsquo;m gonna do everything to get better so I deserve you&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s dope!</p><p>A : Oooh that&rsquo;s too cute!</p><p>J : Basile is Oumar&rsquo;s favorite character</p><p>O : I love him</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s mine too.</p><p>O : He&rsquo;s great</p><p>J : So Oumar is more team Basile than team Eliott about flirting</p><p>A : Ouch</p><p>Max : Ah yeah</p><p>O : No I don&rsquo;t do like Basile! I like Basile. I don&rsquo;t do like Basile.</p><p>A : And you what do you say?</p><p>J : Umm&hellip; I&rsquo;m team&hellip;. About flirt? In skam? Eliott wouldn&rsquo;t work with me. Actually I would  always ask myself, did I understand well, I would always be scared to imagine things</p><p>A : Yeah that&rsquo;s it</p><p>J : So me when there&rsquo;s a doubt it annoys me, I prefer when there&rsquo;s no doubt</p><p>J : Marine wouldn&rsquo;t it work on you? Would it work on you?</p><p>Mar : Uh&hellip; Yeah maybe yeah. Yeah. I like little games yeah.</p><p>J : You&rsquo;re Eliott-like in flirting then (shout out to the dude who&rsquo;s listening to his boss having a casual conversation about how she likes her flirt it&rsquo;s&hellip; kind of surreal) </p><p>Mar : It&rsquo;s possible yeah.</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s probable.</p><p>Mar : It&rsquo;s possible yeah. I think.</p><p>Max : Another!</p><p>A : You didn&rsquo;t answer! (why does this feel like a truth or dare I&rsquo;m so entertained)</p><p>Max : I&rsquo;m the most naive guy on earth. In fact I never notice it when someone flirts with me. It&rsquo;s&hellip; Not but it&rsquo;s hell</p><p>A : He&rsquo;s doing it on purpose I think</p><p>O : &ldquo;Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s true, you like me???&rdquo;</p><p>A : &ldquo;Seriously?? I didn&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</p><p>Max : I know that talking about that&hellip;.</p><p>J : &ldquo;Last time I wrote you &quot;I love you&rdquo; in a letter&quot;! &ldquo;Oh I didn&rsquo;t understand&rdquo;</p><p>Max : No, but like, in high school my friends were laughing at me so much cause every time, well when I was at parties and a girl was coming to talk to me a little and stuff, and I was like &ldquo;ah that&rsquo;s cool !&rdquo; and I was leaving. And they were telling me &ldquo;but dude, it was ok&rdquo; and I was like &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; and actually, two weeks after I was asking her and yes it was ok. And&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t see it.</p><p>J : So you have to be the one to start because you don&rsquo;t understand anything</p><p>Max : But yeah, I&rsquo;m really bad too. I&rsquo;m very shy in fact, so&hellip; I can&rsquo;t do it. But I prefer&hellip; I like the things a bit&hellip; Where you don&rsquo;t really know. When everything is given, it&rsquo;s fun too&hellip;</p><p>J : You like being in doubt</p><p>Max : Yeah yeah, I like that</p><p>J : I don&rsquo;t like like it</p><p>Max : I like it. A bit of mystery, you see</p><p>J : It fits</p><p>O : We&rsquo;ll go join Basile</p><p>A : We&rsquo;ll go join Basile!</p><p>J : We&rsquo;ll form a small team, with Basile.</p><p>O : Ouch [no for real just look at his face it&rsquo;s so funny]</p><p>J : Uh, Eliott has another thing, when he brings Lucas in his little secret place, on the petite ceinture, so for those who aren&rsquo;t parisians, the petite ceinture is an abandoned train rail. So he takes him there.</p><p>Max : It came out as so snob when you said it. &ldquo;so, for those who aren&rsquo;t parisians&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>O : Oh right I didn&rsquo;t even notice!</p><p>Max : &ldquo;For those who live in &quot;province&rdquo;&ldquo;</p><p>O : &quot;Hello losers&rdquo;</p><p>Max : Sorry</p><p>J : That&rsquo;s not what I meant at all. Excuse me</p><p>Max : Excuse me</p><p>O : &ldquo;Excuse me other people, excuse me the rest of France&rdquo;</p><p>Max : Because I [inaudible], we&rsquo;re going to get destroyed. Sorry.</p><p>J : I&rsquo;m not going to make it</p><p>A : Stop you&rsquo;re making her uneasy!</p><p>Max : Yeah clearly</p><p>J : Basically&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll kill you!</p><p>O : I forgot! I&rsquo;m gonna get fired.</p><p>J : There&rsquo;s a little scene that&rsquo;s a bit- Okay let&rsquo;s focus, i&rsquo;m not gonna make it</p><p>Max : You are, you are</p><p>J : There&rsquo;s a little scene a bit strange, where he brings him in a sort of tunnel, in a dark, and he starts turning the light off. Eliott does this, he&rsquo;s turning the torch on and off, he disappears, he&rsquo;s putting him in the dark, he comes back&hellip;</p><p>A : That&rsquo;s&hellip;no, I would&rsquo;ve lost it. You don&rsquo;t do that to me.</p><p>Max : Me neither! Don&rsquo;t look at me it&rsquo;s not me!</p><p>A : You did it! You don&rsquo;t do that actually!</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s a bit scary actually</p><p>Max : When David told me that I was like &ldquo;Seriously? Really?

(okay i\u2019m waiting can someone please start being eliott-cryptic with me)</p><p>Mar : You\u2019re replacing his hair also [here\u2019s there\u2019s a confusion cause what she says (\u201ctu lui redresses l'\u00e9pi\u201d) sounds like \u201ctu lui redresses les pieds\u201d = you\u2019re straightening his feet]</p><p>Max : I\u2019m straightening his feet??</p><p>Mar : You\u2019re replacing his hair</p><p>Max : Oh his hair!</p><p>A : Oh yeah, yeah right!!</p><p>Max : But this is to know how to draw him, it\u2019s not a flirting technique, you see\u2026</p><p>O : He wants to draw him to flirt with him</p><p>J : No but there\u2019s that and there\u2019s all the piano scene (my dudes if that\u2019s being allusive to you how the fuck do you usually flirt)\u2026 He\u2019s super intense in fact, Eliott.</p><p>A : Even in the look in his eyes.

You have to tell me things straight, you have to tell be things clearly, if you\u2019re not clear I won\u2019t mind you. So, yeah.</p><p>O : That\u2019s a Basile</p><p>A : totally! And you know that when I did the Serieously test I got Basile? Serieously did a test on instagram where you answer a quiz and in the end you get a character from the gang, and i got Basile.</p><p>Max : I got Yann (oh same i think) </p><p>J : Yeah you\u2019re more Basile, well Basile is a bit heavy in s3, even tho he\u2019s kinda cute, but he\u2019s still annoying</p><p>A : Yeah he\u2019s still heavy</p><p>J : At least you understand!</p><p>A : Yeah no we understand but, right, not heavy like that</p><p>Max : You\u2019re gonna start getting hit on by guys that are gonna be like\u2026</p><p>J : True be careful, cause really some people take everything really literally.</p><p>O : Still, Basile is cute.</p><p>A : He\u2019s too cute! I like Basile, I like his character</p><p>O : Especially what he tells Daphn\u00e9 at some point, so cute, like at the end of s3 he tells her \u201cI know I\u2019m annoying, but i\u2019m gonna do everything to get better so I deserve you\u201d. That\u2019s dope!</p><p>A : Oooh that\u2019s too cute!</p><p>J : Basile is Oumar\u2019s favorite character</p><p>O : I love him</p><p>Max : It\u2019s mine too.</p><p>O : He\u2019s great</p><p>J : So Oumar is more team Basile than team Eliott about flirting</p><p>A : Ouch</p><p>Max : Ah yeah</p><p>O : No I don\u2019t do like Basile!

Actually I would  always ask myself, did I understand well, I would always be scared to imagine things</p><p>A : Yeah that\u2019s it</p><p>J : So me when there\u2019s a doubt it annoys me, I prefer when there\u2019s no doubt</p><p>J : Marine wouldn\u2019t it work on you? Would it work on you?</p><p>Mar : Uh\u2026 Yeah maybe yeah. Yeah. I like little games yeah.</p><p>J : You\u2019re Eliott-like in flirting then (shout out to the dude who\u2019s listening to his boss having a casual conversation about how she likes her flirt it\u2019s\u2026 kind of surreal) </p><p>Mar : It\u2019s possible yeah.</p><p>J : It\u2019s probable.</p><p>Mar : It\u2019s possible yeah. I think.</p><p>Max : Another!</p><p>A : You didn\u2019t answer! (why does this feel like a truth or dare I\u2019m so entertained)</p><p>Max : I\u2019m the most naive guy on earth. In fact I never notice it when someone flirts with me. It\u2019s\u2026 Not but it\u2019s hell</p><p>A : He\u2019s doing it on purpose I think</p><p>O : \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s true, you like me???\u201d</p><p>A : \u201cSeriously?? I didn\u2019t know\u201d</p><p>Max : I know that talking about that\u2026.</p><p>J : \u201cLast time I wrote you \"I love you\u201d in a letter\"! \u201cOh I didn\u2019t understand\u201d</p><p>Max : No, but like, in high school my friends were laughing at me so much cause every time, well when I was at parties and a girl was coming to talk to me a little and stuff, and I was like \u201cah that\u2019s cool !\u201d and I was leaving. And they were telling me \u201cbut dude, it was ok\u201d and I was like \u201cnonsense\u201d and actually, two weeks after I was asking her and yes it was ok. And\u2026 I didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>J : So you have to be the one to start because you don\u2019t understand anything</p><p>Max : But yeah, I\u2019m really bad too. I\u2019m very shy in fact, so\u2026 I can\u2019t do it. But I prefer\u2026 I like the things a bit\u2026 Where you don\u2019t really know. When everything is given, it\u2019s fun too\u2026</p><p>J : You like being in doubt</p><p>Max : Yeah yeah, I like that</p><p>J : I don\u2019t like like it</p><p>Max : I like it. A bit of mystery, you see</p><p>J : It fits</p><p>O : We\u2019ll go join Basile</p><p>A : We\u2019ll go join Basile!</p><p>J : We\u2019ll form a small team, with Basile.</p><p>O : Ouch [no for real just look at his face it\u2019s so funny]</p><p>J : Uh, Eliott has another thing, when he brings Lucas in his little secret place, on the petite ceinture, so for those who aren\u2019t parisians, the petite ceinture is an abandoned train rail. So he takes him there.</p><p>Max : It came out as so snob when you said it. \u201cso, for those who aren\u2019t parisians\u2026\u201d</p><p>O : Oh right I didn\u2019t even notice!</p><p>Max : \u201cFor those who live in \"province\u201d\u201c</p><p>O : \"Hello losers\u201d</p><p>Max : Sorry</p><p>J : That\u2019s not what I meant at all. Excuse me</p><p>Max : Excuse me</p><p>O : \u201cExcuse me other people, excuse me the rest of France\u201d</p><p>Max : Because I [inaudible], we\u2019re going to get destroyed.

Eliott does this, he\u2019s turning the torch on and off, he disappears, he\u2019s putting him in the dark, he comes back\u2026</p><p>A : That\u2019s\u2026no, I would\u2019ve lost it. You don\u2019t do that to me.</p><p>Max : Me neither! Don\u2019t look at me it\u2019s not me!</p><p>A : You did it! You don\u2019t do that actually!</p><p>J : It\u2019s a bit scary actually</p><p>Max : When David told me that I was like \u201cSeriously? Really?

No but basically, what we can see in s3 is that Eliott has several ways to flirt. At the start he has one a bit more delicate, I&rsquo;d call that &ldquo;allusive flirting&rdquo;. That is to say that he&rsquo;s making a lot of little innuendos, he&rsquo;s throwing hints like that, i&rsquo;m especially thinking about&hellip;</p><p>Max : &ldquo;Not necessarily a girl&rdquo;? (bitch is this allusive for you???) </p><p>J : Yeah, that scene! Where he walks with Lucas</p><p>Max : At that point he attacks</p><p>A : I admit!</p><p>J : Yeah but actually, he attacks but at the same time is that really clear? because frankly, me, you tell me something like this&hellip; Maybe I would tell myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m imagining things&rdquo;, isn&rsquo;t it a bit too cryptic? (okay i&rsquo;m waiting can someone please start being eliott-cryptic with me)</p><p>Mar : You&rsquo;re replacing his hair also [here&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a confusion cause what she says (&ldquo;tu lui redresses l'&eacute;pi&rdquo;) sounds like &ldquo;tu lui redresses les pieds&rdquo; = you&rsquo;re straightening his feet]</p><p>Max : I&rsquo;m straightening his feet??</p><p>Mar : You&rsquo;re replacing his hair</p><p>Max : Oh his hair!</p><p>A : Oh yeah, yeah right!!</p><p>Max : But this is to know how to draw him, it&rsquo;s not a flirting technique, you see&hellip;</p><p>O : He wants to draw him to flirt with him</p><p>J : No but there&rsquo;s that and there&rsquo;s all the piano scene (my dudes if that&rsquo;s being allusive to you how the fuck do you usually flirt)&hellip; He&rsquo;s super intense in fact, Eliott.</p><p>A : Even in the look in his eyes. You have a look in your eyes, it&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s intense!</p><p>A : Like you see everything in his eyes, you&rsquo;re telling yourself, fuck that&rsquo;s crazy what are you thinking about to&hellip;?

How are you?</p><p>J : I&rsquo;m fine and you Oumar?</p><!-- more --><p>O : I&rsquo;m fine I&rsquo;m super happy to be with you, for the premiere of the show &ldquo;On slash&rdquo;. So I&rsquo;ll explain the concept quickly. Basically we&rsquo;re gonna talk for an hour, we&rsquo;re gonna do quizzes, we&rsquo;re gonna do debates, and yeah the idea is really to speak freely in between us, casually, around that table. So today I&rsquo;m with two members of the Slash team. I&rsquo;m with Judith, editorial manager of Slash</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>O : That&rsquo;s your name?</p><p>J : Yeah!</p><p>O : Judith. Who&rsquo;s also my boss by the way, on Slash.</p><p>J : Here you go.</p><p>O : So it feels really weird to do a show with your boss, that&rsquo;s the first time, but i&rsquo;m not too stressed</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s gonna be fine</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s gonna be okay. Be careful</p><p>O : And I&rsquo;m also with Marine</p><p>Mar : Who&rsquo;s&hellip; I&rsquo;m not your boss, unfortunately</p><p>O : But who is still the stories manager of France tv slash on instagram, and snapchat</p><p>Mar : Exactly</p><p>O : And our two guests of today : Assa Sylla and Maxence Danet-Fauvel. How are you?</p><p>Max : very good, always</p><p>A : I&rsquo;m very good too.</p><p>O : Can you explain a bit to me who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing in skam?</p><p>A : So, I&rsquo;m Assa Sylla, I come from [undaudible], I play Imane&rsquo;s character. Sana in the norwegian version</p><p>O : So you&rsquo;re the main of Skam&rsquo;s season 4</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>O : And you?</p><p>Max : And I&rsquo;m Maxence, and i play Eliott in season 3. Of, well of skam. And uh, and yeah. And it&rsquo;s enough.</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s very good, it&rsquo;s very good like this</p><p>J : And wait we forgot to tell about you!</p><p>O : Oh yeah me! Who am I? Introduce me</p><p>Max : That one&rsquo;s for you</p><p>A : Why is it for me?</p><p>Max : Because you know him! </p><p>A : So here&rsquo;s Oumar Diaou</p><p>J : No, Diawara</p><p>A : Diawara</p><p>O : She doesn&rsquo;t know my name!</p><p>A : Sorry. We&rsquo;re doing it again</p><p>O : We&rsquo;ll cut while editing</p><p>J : No</p><p>A : Okay, so that&rsquo;s Oumar Diawara, he&rsquo;s the host of the Moonwalk show, that I encourage you all to watch it&rsquo;s so good</p><p>O : So today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about Skam france, we&rsquo;re gonna do a debrief from s3, from s4 of the show too, and ask you some questions about this. Are you ready?</p><p>O : So the first question is a bit simple but how do you feel after s3 and 4 aired?</p><p>A : So good</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>A : I think, and it&rsquo;s such a relief</p><p>Max : Proud too</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : Why proud?</p><p>Max : Well proud that&hellip; That we had such an impact, and that the message that we tried to send was like, transmitted the right way and, and to so many people.</p><p>O : Do you think it changed the life of some people?</p><p>A : Totally</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p><p>A : We often get messages on social media, where a lot of people are thanking us for this show, are telling us &ldquo;thank you, Skam changed my life, thank you i finally saw myself represented on tv, thank you cause I finally understand&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s so good</p><p>O : And your life changed too i think</p><p>Max : A bit yeah</p><p>A : A bit yeah</p><p>Max : A little yeah</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : In what way did it change?</p><p>Max : Well we&rsquo;re invited to shows&hellip;</p><p>A : Yeah, we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re here!</p><p>O : With Oumar Diaou!</p><p>Max : No it changes life, [I can&rsquo;t understand shit] is so practical!</p><p>O : the little joke! Such a kid</p><p>A : Yeah, a real one.</p><p>Max : Yeah, for real, it made me discover new subway lines,</p><p>A : No, but for real, we get credit for what we do, we&rsquo;re doing talk shows, interviews, and for real for me personally it didn&rsquo;t really change my life cause I&rsquo;m always the same but it still changed&hellip;</p><p>Max : It didn&rsquo;t change us as people, but it changed a bit-</p><p>A : our daily lives</p><p>Max : Exactly, our daily lives.</p><p>O : People&rsquo;s judgment too.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>Max : People&rsquo;s judgment yeah&hellip; Yeah, yeah it&rsquo;s true. And yeah, all this thing, all this wave that assaulted us a bit, that we didn&rsquo;t expect at all, be it us or you or anyone actually. And that&rsquo;s true that yeah it changes quite a lot of things cause we get stopped in the street, even when we go to screenings, well.</p><p>J : And you were a bit worried by the way, in the start, about that. It was really impressive to you</p><p>Max : It was my first project, so what was the most impressive to me was to be in front of a camera cause I was just out of school, I was a baby I had never acted, and after that yeah, all of this infatuation that arrived all of a sudden. And when it&rsquo;s a first thing that you do, you&rsquo;ve never been used to handle promotion even on a movie with less, you know, less&hellip; How can you call that? Of&hellip;</p><p>J : Buzz/turmoil ?</p><p>Max : Buzz/turmoil (that sounds stupid sjdkdkd I&rsquo;m sorry the word is just not really translatable) ! That&rsquo;s the word I was looking for. Uh, well at this moment all of a sudden you&rsquo;re thrown in the lions&rsquo; pit and you have to handle promo, you have to handle speeches that are a bit sensible, where you can get a bit destroyed by both sides in some ways, you know. And you find yourself in this and&hellip; So yeah that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s&hellip;. That&rsquo;s scary</p><p>J : And you&rsquo;re really careful about the aim of your words. You were really careful. Cause I interviewed him, maxence, and he was very very careful, from the start already you were&hellip; First of all very impressed cause it was, I think the second screening. Which was&hellip;</p><p>Max : Oh yeah! In the small leather seats?</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>J : And, I noticed that you were really careful about the words you were choosing, you really cared for that</p><p>Max : Yeah, well because, because you know sometimes in a bit of a stupid way- and it&rsquo;s also the message we want to pass with skam, in our season for example, about homophobia and everything, sometimes you&rsquo;re just not careful, and you say something stupid, because it&rsquo;s like a thing you say without thinking since middle school or something, and, or sometimes you express yourself badly, and you can be bashed a lot actually. Cause that&rsquo;s also the &ldquo;two sides&rsquo; of that thing, of that buzz. Cause on one hand yes we get a lot of love and etc, but if you say one word out of the way, you can be destroyed really really fast, cause we&rsquo;re on, well, unfortunately sensitive topics. It can be sometimes difficult to&hellip; Well, I express myself freely cause that&rsquo;s really, well that&rsquo;s how I think and that&rsquo;s the way I am, I would&rsquo;ve never done such a project otherwise, but everything can be distorted, very fast, not making the cut and&hellip; You can get beaten up real fast</p><p>O : no one&rsquo;s gonna ask for that not to make the cut! He&rsquo;s afraid we&rsquo;ll frame him!</p><p>A : But in the end it went well</p><p>Max : In the end it went really well</p><p>A : yeah</p><p>O : And especially to live that being that young, because Assa I think you&rsquo;re 23, you 24</p><p>Max : 25. 26 next week</p><p>O : 25? I saw 1994 on the internet</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s false</p><p>O : Oh shit!</p><p>Max : 93</p><p>O : Everyone got it wrong. Okay, now we have the info that&rsquo;s cool. So yeah to live that being this young, isn&rsquo;t it hard?</p><p>A : I don&rsquo;t really know</p><p>Max : I&rsquo;ll admit I had a bit of a down at some point. That is to say that the first month, month and a half i loved it, except that in fact, since it went higher and higher we gave a lot, it being me, Axel, David, well all of the cast, and we gave a lot to people, and we didn&rsquo;t really protect ourselves. Which lead to me having around March a period while I was down about all that cause you get a lot of energy in your face, cause people are coming with their stories, either very beautiful or very hard, and they&rsquo;re telling it to you as if you were their best friend almost,</p><p>A : Yeah that&rsquo;s super hard</p><p>O : You have messages a bit&hellip;</p><p>A :Yeah, it was really very very hard to read, and i told myself &quot;I don&rsquo;t even know what to answer, cause&hellip;&rdquo; Yeah, there are messages that are really, really hard</p><p>Max : And actually you have to learn to put this aside and to tell yourself it&rsquo;s not about you, but your actor, your character. And sometimes the border is a bit complicated cause then during the screenings it&rsquo;s us that have to handle people, except that they relate to the character that your interpreted, and since they&rsquo;re very close to our personality, because that&rsquo;s how skam is they&rsquo;re writing the characters depending on us too, the border is a bit hard to handle for them, and for me personally it was even a bit hard at some point for me, cause I was waking up on mornings and was like &ldquo;fuck, wait&rdquo;</p><p>O : Who is who</p><p>Max : Yeah, who feels what, and&hellip;</p><p>J : What am I feeling!</p><p>O : And on slash&rsquo;s side, how did we live it. I know that us, with clips airing and etc, we were really centered on skam. You Marine, you handle the instagram of slash, you got a lot of texts.</p><p>Mar : Yeah, cause every Monday we were airing a story, and we had each time either people telling us that we were a bit sadistic to make us relive the event that happened so they were even more down- either they were crying or we also got a lot of love- or they were really impatient to know more so they would ask when the clip was gonna come out, and it was&hellip; It was pretty impressive yeah.</p><p>O : And I think there were also people that were a bit like &ldquo;yeah, you&rsquo;re taking time airing the clips&rdquo;</p><p>Mar :Yeah, totally. Before Fridays we had a bit of pressure</p><p>J : Yeah we had pressure! Even on YouTube if we were publishing something else than skam, they were trolling us a little in the comments</p><p>O : Moonwalk comments are always like &ldquo;where is skam?&rdquo;. I was so disappointed!</p><p>Mar : People asking us also to translate in Spanish, in English, every story cause they couldn&rsquo;t translate. And last week a very funny message, someone who wrote &ldquo;I can see a show that looks great, but I don&rsquo;t know what that is&rdquo;, so there are still people not watching</p><p>Max : That&rsquo;s great</p><p>A : That&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>J :That&rsquo;s good!</p><p>O : Yeah totally, people are knowing it more and more. And you Judith, do you have a specific memory?</p><p>J : My specific memory is more about the fans, who were doing a lot of things, in between drawings..</p><p>Max :tattoos</p><p>J : tattoos, that&rsquo;s true there are poeple that got tattoos.</p><p>A : Oh I didn&rsquo;t know!</p><p>Max :Yeah that&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>J : And I did, by the way hi Marianne - I did a small video for Marianne who made a song</p><p>Max :Oh you were the one to do it? So cool!</p><p>J : About season 3 and 4, well no season 3, the lucas and eliott season. And she wrote a very beautiful song and we made her a little acoustic session. And yeah, it&rsquo;s one of my biggest memories around skam cause, the idea was also for France tv slash to give back all of this infatuation with Skam&rsquo;s community, and it was a small gesture to show &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, keep on going!&rdquo;. A very beautiful community. So big kisses to Marianne by the way.</p><p>O : The screenings by the way, I came to one of the screenings and it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s quite crazy. Like people react to each clip like crazy&hellip; How do you react?</p><p>Max : Do you want to start?</p><p>Mar :And you&rsquo;re discovering yourselves almost.</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;re discovering ourselves, we were discovering ourselves live on a theater. And when you&rsquo;re in the main roles, well Assa was a main and i was a pivotal role around Lucas, it&rsquo;s- you&rsquo;re on screen a lot so you see yourself a lot, and&hellip; Had you already seen yourself act before?</p><p>A :Yeah</p><p>Max : Okay. I had never seen myself on screen. Oh yeah Bande de filles (Assa&rsquo;s previous movie) that&rsquo;s true. And yeah during the first screening clearly I finished the screening approximately like that [he&rsquo;s like crumpled in the bottom of his seat] on my cinema seat. Ah yeah, I was not good. I was not good at all. And finally you start playing the game little by little, you get used to it a bit, but you always have the little shot, we were talking about it five minutes ago, always the little adrenaline shot before arriving cause, cause yeah you&rsquo;re&hellip; It&rsquo;s still very disturbing. Yeah</p><p>Mar : Did you rewatch the clips at home, without an audience?</p><p>Max : Uh, not, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m not watching it a lot. Yeah. I watch the episodes when they come out and etc, I watched s4 normally, because I&rsquo;m almost not in it, so it was perfect, but it&rsquo;s a bit weird to be home alone and to watch yourself on your computer&hellip; It&rsquo;s cool to watch it, i was watching it with friends, or, yeah.</p><p>A : Yeah I was always watching with friends too. But I was still watching the clips. Because I had to watch it was stressing me out</p><p>J : Why is it stressing you out?</p><p>A :Well actually, as for the screenings, I already saw myself to the cinema, but it&rsquo;s still always as hard to see yourself actually. And during screenings you see yourself in huge, while we usually watch on our phone or computer, and you see yourself on big screen and i see all of my flaws I tell myself &ldquo;fuck why did you make that face, why did you do that&rdquo; and it makes me crazy really. But yeah frankly screenings were really impressive. Especially the way fans were reacting, it was crazy, and it was giving us even more strength, it was giving me a lot of hope.</p><p>O : Who&rsquo;ll summarize s3 for me?</p><p>A : Ohlala, ohlala</p><p>Max :Summarize it?</p><p>O : Summarize it yeah. The story, the plot.</p><p>Max : wow</p><p>O : You were in it!</p><p>Max : Yes yes! Is that true? Oh yeah it was such a long time ago!</p><p>Mar : You have a pretty important role!</p><p>A : Your questions are hard! Summarize it just like that</p><p>Max : Summarize, uh&hellip; It&rsquo;s&hellip; To summarize it, it&rsquo;s the story of a young high-schooler who&rsquo;s called lucas, who&rsquo;s questioning his sexuality, and who&rsquo;s discovering himself and accepting himself as gay little by little, going through steps as friends, the girl he uses as a beard, then people at school, parents, etc. To finally try to live his love story correctly.</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s a good summary.</p><p>Max :Is it fine?</p><p>O : It was really cool</p><p>Max : My hands are all clammy! </p><p>O : Okay okay chill. So a question a bit simpler, do you have a moment that marked you in that season?</p><p>A : For season 3? Oh the party. Infiltration. Oh that was sooo cool to shot.</p><p>M : It was very very cool to shot. Infiltration, well I arrived in the end so I was under a blanket in the &ldquo;combo&rdquo; room. But yeah it was a great shooting day. All in costumes&hellip;</p><p>A : We shot it at night and each time it was so cool cause we would put the music full volume, and each time because there were moments where we had to cut the music for sound, and we had to keep on dancing, it&rsquo;s not easy, but it was so good, frankly we were such in a good mood, and we had the costumes, we loved the costumes we had and everything</p><p>Max : And there were a lot of extras, who were into it 3000%, as much as we were, and, very very cool to shot and you know as you say we&rsquo;re pretty young, our high school years are not so far, so being in character, to have a party a bit&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have the word can you help me?</p><p>J : Secret/clandestine</p><p>M : Secret/clandestine yes! In a school like that, it brings you back - well i never did this when i was in high school - but it&rsquo;s cool. It feels good.</p><p>A : it was so cool</p><p>J :So both the party</p><p>Max : Not for me. Well yeah clearly the party, but since I was not on set a lot&hellip; For me the scene that marked me the most was the paint scene. The mural. Because it was the scene that asked us to let go the most. I&rsquo;m really talking as an actor, not the scene that I preferred shooting or anything, but it&rsquo;s really&hellip; Well, when we finished shooting it, we looked at each other with Axel and were like &ldquo;fuck, we&rsquo;re actually capable of doing that kind of thing, and we&rsquo;re capable of letting go of everything and to dedicate ourselves 300% to our director, first of all, and to our roles, and also to the audience. And-</p><p>Mar : How did you make the paint go after?</p><p>Max : we were under the shower for one hour, one hour and a half. And uh, yeah, it was everywhere. Ears, teeth. It was hell. Yeah</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s true that, it&rsquo;s not nothing, for a first&hellip; It was really the first time that you were acting in front of a camera, so it&rsquo;s not nothing</p><p>Max : Yeah. Yeah. And a sex scene too.</p><p>J : Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Max : So, it was&hellip;</p><p>J : A nice achievement</p><p>Max : A nice&hellip; Yeah. A nice&hellip; Yeah. No but I was happy, you see. I was happy, I&rsquo;m telling myself, at least I will have lived a love story with a guy one day in my life, since&hellip; yeah, and, no it was very very cool&hellip; Uh, then I have thousands of beautiful memories, like, all of the&hellip; all of the boat scene, we arrived in this boat that they had decorated beforehand, we saw all of that, really we discovered it during the scene, and that was crazy&hellip; No but actually everything was great. No but that&rsquo;s true! Each time I&rsquo;m telling you about something there&rsquo;s another one coming on my mind, now I&rsquo;m thinking about the petite ceinture, we have hundreds of stories (tell them all you coward) about each day of filming, so&hellip;</p><p>O : And when you watch the show, isn&rsquo;t there a scene where you tell yourself &quot;okay that&rsquo;s a strong scene that&rsquo;s gonna impact people&rdquo;? A specific scene?</p><p>Max : For me there was the scene of the first kiss under the rain that killed me, yeah (been there done that). It&rsquo;s the first time where watching skam, well it comes quite fast, but, where I manged to watch without seeing myself. You see?</p><p>A : Oh yeah? That&rsquo;s hard!</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s super hard.</p><p>A : It&rsquo;s super hard </p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s super hard, because you judge yourself quite a lot, as you were saying, you judge yourself a lot, you look, you tell yourself &ldquo;fuck, why didn&rsquo;t I do this or that&rdquo; and actually, actually we were so into the filming that at first I didn&rsquo;t notice- because the whole Eliott&rsquo;s film thing came after we filmed this scene, or maybe before I don&rsquo;t know but I had forgotten about it. And actually, when I rewatch the thing&hellip; At first, I didn&rsquo;t understand why David would make us hold our hands up like this (MAXENCE SKDKDKFKFSJDJDKD). Really, before kissing, I didn&rsquo;t understand. And all of a sudden, I watch and i realize while watching the episode. So that&rsquo;s the scene that gave me a big slap in the face, because I had completely missed it.</p><p>J : Yeah you didn&rsquo;t connected at all&hellip;</p><p>O : Connected with what? With the fact it matches your project?</p><p>Max : The fact that actually, Lucas and Eliott&rsquo;s first kiss-</p><p>O : I hadn&rsquo;t realize, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed at all (w o w)</p><p>Max : You see?</p><p>J : But yes! Actually, the movie project is exactly the same scene</p><p>Max : Yeah. It&rsquo;s exactly the same that happens, the tunnel, the hands up, they join, bam they end up-</p><p>O : You had all realized that?</p><p>Everyone around the table, me, y'all, Obama : Well yeah</p><p>O : Okay&hellip; That&rsquo;s dope! And you Assa, was there an impactful scene when you were watching season 3?</p><p>A : For me the scene that marked me the most is the paint scene! And I remember, when they were filming, with the girls we were in the dressing rooms, and we wanted to watch the scene so bad! But David said no way, no one watches the scene, and after when we discovered the scene we were like &ldquo;oh yeah, oh yeah that was really hot!&rdquo;</p><p>Max : Clearly. Not but it&rsquo;s beautiful, you see even us when we were looking at ourselves in the end we were all green, brown, black, you know like disgusting mixed painting, and on screen it comes off so well! Every color is here, and i was very afraid of it looking like sort of mud, green/black you know, a bit like when you&rsquo;re a kid and you mix  up every paint color in your plate, and finally it comes off really really well yeah.</p><p>O : even the fans loved this scene, no? Marine?</p><p>Mar : Ah yes, yes, completely. We got lots of hearts.</p><p>Max : Yeah? Every color?</p><p>Mar : Every color obviously.</p><p>O : And I&rsquo;ll ask you too, the scenes that impacted you in s3?</p><p>J : My impactful scene from s3&hellip; It&rsquo;s when Lucas gets outed by Chlo\u00e9, because I though that was super important to talk about it. By the way we&rsquo;re gonna take this opportunity to say, don&rsquo;t out people (listen to what the lady&rsquo;s saying kids). Uh, yeah.</p><p>O : What is outing people?</p><p>J : Outing, outing is- See i wrote it so I won&rsquo;t say stupid things. Outing is basically reveal someone&rsquo;s homosexuality, bisexuality or trans intensity, without asking- without their consent. So yeah you don&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s violating someone&rsquo;s privacy, and there&rsquo;s also a path, it&rsquo;s up to people to decide the moment to come out, if they wanna do it or not by the way. Anyways, you don&rsquo;t out people. So I thought it was important to&hellip; For me this scene was super important, cause we often talk about coming out but we don&rsquo;t talk about that thing that is outing, which is something super violent, and so for me that scene was essential, and it realkuy marked me, and especially I found it very well acted by Axel (y e s)</p><p>Max : That&rsquo;s what I was going to say yeah, Axel Auriant is outstanding in this scene.</p><p>J : This scene killed me, really, I cried. And I saw it, i think it was at the screening</p><p>Max : Yeah, it was</p><p>J : Cause I saw it on big screen so&hellip; With eddy de pretto as the background music, and the punch in the door. By the way, maybe you&rsquo;re gonna confirm this but I think he really punched for real</p><p>A : Yeah apparently. Apparently he really hurted himself</p><p>Max : Yeah, he really&hellip; Well, it was makeup on his fingers but he really smashed his hand yeah. Yeah.</p><p>J : But really, well I cried&hellip; (been there done that part 2) And really for me this scene is the most impactful and especially it&rsquo;s very important. Here. So to say it again, don&rsquo;t out people please.</p><p>Max : Be careful</p><p>A : Oh yeah and I just thought about it, there&rsquo;s a scene that impacted me a lot too in s3, it&rsquo;s the moment where he&rsquo;s at church, and then there&rsquo;s the music&hellip; This one! And with the music adding up, that music is just perfect</p><p>O : I was listening to it on a loop!</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s good</p><p>A : I downloaded it right away. I really loved the song frankly, and after when he starts running and he&rsquo;s joining Eliott, this scene is crazy, frankly I loved it, so beautiful</p><p>O : What about you Marine do you have a scene?</p><p>Mar : There&rsquo;s a scene I loved a lot, it&rsquo;s the dialogue in between Lucas and Mika on the couch, I don&rsquo;t know if you see? Where basically Lucas starts saying there&rsquo;s something going on with Eliott, but that at the same time he doesn&rsquo;t want to say he&rsquo;s gay because he&rsquo;s not considering himself a stereotyped gay, and i think it&rsquo;s quite representative of what can happen at this age, what Lucas expresses is what society can think about gay people, and that&rsquo;s a sort of homophobia that he internalized, he wants to get out of it but he doesn&rsquo;t really know who is he is actually. And I found this strong, after that, the message that mika was passing saying it was out people who were helping the cause,and i found that strong. And I thought it was a nice political message but passed really smoothly, it was nice.</p><p>O : That&rsquo;s true that, I was wondering, while you&rsquo;re filming, do you tell yourself &ldquo;there are people watching, maybe it&rsquo;s gonna change things&rdquo;</p><p>Max : No</p><p>A : No, frankly not at all</p><p>Max : Well I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s working what way, but, I know how Axel works at least, and  we have pretty much the same way of working that is to say, we&rsquo;re our characters from 8am to 8pm if we&rsquo;re filming, if we&rsquo;re filming until 5am we&rsquo;re our characters until 5am, and actually we don&rsquo;t think about the message, and it&rsquo;s a bit- when you act a scene you have to think about yourself, and what your character lives at the moment, you should not think about the impact you could have cause it&rsquo;s getting you out of your role, it brings you back to you&hellip; To me Maxence, for example, or to Assa or&hellip; Except we&rsquo;re not ourselves on set. So you really shouldn&rsquo;t think about the result, basically. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>J : Anyways that&rsquo;s more of David&rsquo;s job. He makes you act something, but because he has an idea in his directing about where he wants things to go.</p><p>Max :Yeah but you don&rsquo;t think about a message. Well. The message, you see it when you read your script, first reading, you tell yourself &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s cool, bam bam bam&rdquo;</p><p>A : And especially when you discover. When I discover the episodes I tell myself &ldquo;oh yeah I understand David better now! He wanted to do that&rdquo; because on set, we act and we don&rsquo;t think about after, we don&rsquo;t think about how the scene is gonna be perceived by the audience, we&rsquo;re really in our characters and&hellip;</p><p>O : He doesn&rsquo;t brief you at all on this?</p><p>Max : No because it&rsquo;s not important</p><p>A : Yeah it&rsquo;s not useful. He just briefes us about how we have to act. How we have to feel things and how we have to act, it&rsquo;s really not&hellip;</p><p>Max : Because if we act bad, the messages won&rsquo;t be passed. If we fail our scenes, if we&rsquo;re not true in what we say during our scenes, the messages won&rsquo;t pass. Actually, the messages are a bit the result of all of the processus we put in place to create our character and-</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>Max : Yeah. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s magical in being an actor. It&rsquo;s that, you see, you&rsquo;re alone in your room working on your scripts, working on your stuff, on set you&rsquo;re focused you&rsquo;re not thinking about anything else, and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s out and you see the impact</p><p>A : Really, it&rsquo;s exactly that</p><p>Max :And it&rsquo;s really the most beautiful gift of our job</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : We&rsquo;re moving on to the debate</p><p>J : Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to do a debate</p><p>Max : And we don&rsquo;t talk about season 4?</p><p>J : Yes we do!</p><p>O : right after</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s my favorite [?]</p><p>J : right after. There&rsquo;s a debate about s3 then debate about s4, and they&rsquo;re really important debates.</p><p>Max : okay</p><p>J : Ie, a debate about Eliott actually, are we for or against- Are Eliott&rsquo;s flirting techniques that good? (bitch&hellip;&hellip;. yes) What do you think about it?</p><p><i>okay I&rsquo;ll stop there for now and i&rsquo;m continuing the other half right away on another post, sorry this is taking so much time </i></p>",

Such a kid</p><p>A : Yeah, a real one.</p><p>Max : Yeah, for real, it made me discover new subway lines,</p><p>A : No, but for real, we get credit for what we do, we\u2019re doing talk shows, interviews, and for real for me personally it didn\u2019t really change my life cause I\u2019m always the same but it still changed\u2026</p><p>Max : It didn\u2019t change us as people, but it changed a bit-</p><p>A : our daily lives</p><p>Max : Exactly, our daily lives.</p><p>O : People\u2019s judgment too.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>Max : People\u2019s judgment yeah\u2026 Yeah, yeah it\u2019s true. And yeah, all this thing, all this wave that assaulted us a bit, that we didn\u2019t expect at all, be it us or you or anyone actually. And that\u2019s true that yeah it changes quite a lot of things cause we get stopped in the street, even when we go to screenings, well.</p><p>J : And you were a bit worried by the way, in the start, about that. It was really impressive to you</p><p>Max : It was my first project, so what was the most impressive to me was to be in front of a camera cause I was just out of school, I was a baby I had never acted, and after that yeah, all of this infatuation that arrived all of a sudden. And when it\u2019s a first thing that you do, you\u2019ve never been used to handle promotion even on a movie with less, you know, less\u2026 How can you call that? Of\u2026</p><p>J : Buzz/turmoil ?</p><p>Max : Buzz/turmoil (that sounds stupid sjdkdkd I\u2019m sorry the word is just not really translatable) ! That\u2019s the word I was looking for. Uh, well at this moment all of a sudden you\u2019re thrown in the lions\u2019 pit and you have to handle promo, you have to handle speeches that are a bit sensible, where you can get a bit destroyed by both sides in some ways, you know. And you find yourself in this and\u2026 So yeah that\u2019s, that\u2019s\u2026. That\u2019s scary</p><p>J : And you\u2019re really careful about the aim of your words. You were really careful. Cause I interviewed him, maxence, and he was very very careful, from the start already you were\u2026 First of all very impressed cause it was, I think the second screening. Which was\u2026</p><p>Max : Oh yeah! In the small leather seats?</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>J : And, I noticed that you were really careful about the words you were choosing, you really cared for that</p><p>Max : Yeah, well because, because you know sometimes in a bit of a stupid way- and it\u2019s also the message we want to pass with skam, in our season for example, about homophobia and everything, sometimes you\u2019re just not careful, and you say something stupid, because it\u2019s like a thing you say without thinking since middle school or something, and, or sometimes you express yourself badly, and you can be bashed a lot actually. Cause that\u2019s also the \u201ctwo sides\u2019 of that thing, of that buzz. Cause on one hand yes we get a lot of love and etc, but if you say one word out of the way, you can be destroyed really really fast, cause we\u2019re on, well, unfortunately sensitive topics. It can be sometimes difficult to\u2026 Well, I express myself freely cause that\u2019s really, well that\u2019s how I think and that\u2019s the way I am, I would\u2019ve never done such a project otherwise, but everything can be distorted, very fast, not making the cut and\u2026 You can get beaten up real fast</p><p>O : no one\u2019s gonna ask for that not to make the cut! He\u2019s afraid we\u2019ll frame him!</p><p>A : But in the end it went well</p><p>Max : In the end it went really well</p><p>A : yeah</p><p>O : And especially to live that being that young, because Assa I think you\u2019re 23, you 24</p><p>Max : 25. 26 next week</p><p>O : 25? I saw 1994 on the internet</p><p>Max : It\u2019s false</p><p>O : Oh shit!</p><p>Max : 93</p><p>O : Everyone got it wrong. Okay, now we have the info that\u2019s cool. So yeah to live that being this young, isn\u2019t it hard?</p><p>A : I don\u2019t really know</p><p>Max : I\u2019ll admit I had a bit of a down at some point. That is to say that the first month, month and a half i loved it, except that in fact, since it went higher and higher we gave a lot, it being me, Axel, David, well all of the cast, and we gave a lot to people, and we didn\u2019t really protect ourselves. Which lead to me having around March a period while I was down about all that cause you get a lot of energy in your face, cause people are coming with their stories, either very beautiful or very hard, and they\u2019re telling it to you as if you were their best friend almost,</p><p>A : Yeah that\u2019s super hard</p><p>O : You have messages a bit\u2026</p><p>A :Yeah, it was really very very hard to read, and i told myself \"I don\u2019t even know what to answer, cause\u2026\u201d Yeah, there are messages that are really, really hard</p><p>Max : And actually you have to learn to put this aside and to tell yourself it\u2019s not about you, but your actor, your character. And sometimes the border is a bit complicated cause then during the screenings it\u2019s us that have to handle people, except that they relate to the character that your interpreted, and since they\u2019re very close to our personality, because that\u2019s how skam is they\u2019re writing the characters depending on us too, the border is a bit hard to handle for them, and for me personally it was even a bit hard at some point for me, cause I was waking up on mornings and was like \u201cfuck, wait\u201d</p><p>O : Who is who</p><p>Max : Yeah, who feels what, and\u2026</p><p>J : What am I feeling!</p><p>O : And on slash\u2019s side, how did we live it. I know that us, with clips airing and etc, we were really centered on skam. You Marine, you handle the instagram of slash, you got a lot of texts.</p><p>Mar : Yeah, cause every Monday we were airing a story, and we had each time either people telling us that we were a bit sadistic to make us relive the event that happened so they were even more down- either they were crying or we also got a lot of love- or they were really impatient to know more so they would ask when the clip was gonna come out, and it was\u2026 It was pretty impressive yeah.</p><p>O : And I think there were also people that were a bit like \u201cyeah, you\u2019re taking time airing the clips\u201d</p><p>Mar :Yeah, totally. Before Fridays we had a bit of pressure</p><p>J : Yeah we had pressure! Even on YouTube if we were publishing something else than skam, they were trolling us a little in the comments</p><p>O : Moonwalk comments are always like \u201cwhere is skam?\u201d. I was so disappointed!</p><p>Mar : People asking us also to translate in Spanish, in English, every story cause they couldn\u2019t translate. And last week a very funny message, someone who wrote \u201cI can see a show that looks great, but I don\u2019t know what that is\u201d, so there are still people not watching</p><p>Max : That\u2019s great</p><p>A : That\u2019s crazy</p><p>J :That\u2019s good!</p><p>O : Yeah totally, people are knowing it more and more. And you Judith, do you have a specific memory?</p><p>J : My specific memory is more about the fans, who were doing a lot of things, in between drawings..</p><p>Max :tattoos</p><p>J : tattoos, that\u2019s true there are poeple that got tattoos.</p><p>A : Oh I didn\u2019t know!</p><p>Max :Yeah that\u2019s crazy</p><p>J : And I did, by the way hi Marianne - I did a small video for Marianne who made a song</p><p>Max :Oh you were the one to do it? So cool!</p><p>J : About season 3 and 4, well no season 3, the lucas and eliott season. And she wrote a very beautiful song and we made her a little acoustic session. And yeah, it\u2019s one of my biggest memories around skam cause, the idea was also for France tv slash to give back all of this infatuation with Skam\u2019s community, and it was a small gesture to show \u201cthat\u2019s cool, keep on going!\u201d. A very beautiful community. So big kisses to Marianne by the way.</p><p>O : The screenings by the way, I came to one of the screenings and it\u2019s true that it\u2019s quite crazy. Like people react to each clip like crazy\u2026 How do you react?</p><p>Max : Do you want to start?</p><p>Mar :And you\u2019re discovering yourselves almost.</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that\u2019s it, we\u2019re discovering ourselves, we were discovering ourselves live on a theater. And when you\u2019re in the main roles, well Assa was a main and i was a pivotal role around Lucas, it\u2019s- you\u2019re on screen a lot so you see yourself a lot, and\u2026 Had you already seen yourself act before?</p><p>A :Yeah</p><p>Max : Okay. I had never seen myself on screen. Oh yeah Bande de filles (Assa\u2019s previous movie) that\u2019s true. And yeah during the first screening clearly I finished the screening approximately like that [he\u2019s like crumpled in the bottom of his seat] on my cinema seat. Ah yeah, I was not good. I was not good at all. And finally you start playing the game little by little, you get used to it a bit, but you always have the little shot, we were talking about it five minutes ago, always the little adrenaline shot before arriving cause, cause yeah you\u2019re\u2026 It\u2019s still very disturbing. Yeah</p><p>Mar : Did you rewatch the clips at home, without an audience?</p><p>Max : Uh, not, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not watching it a lot. Yeah. I watch the episodes when they come out and etc, I watched s4 normally, because I\u2019m almost not in it, so it was perfect, but it\u2019s a bit weird to be home alone and to watch yourself on your computer\u2026 It\u2019s cool to watch it, i was watching it with friends, or, yeah.</p><p>A : Yeah I was always watching with friends too. But I was still watching the clips. Because I had to watch it was stressing me out</p><p>J : Why is it stressing you out?</p><p>A :Well actually, as for the screenings, I already saw myself to the cinema, but it\u2019s still always as hard to see yourself actually. And during screenings you see yourself in huge, while we usually watch on our phone or computer, and you see yourself on big screen and i see all of my flaws I tell myself \u201cfuck why did you make that face, why did you do that\u201d and it makes me crazy really. But yeah frankly screenings were really impressive. Especially the way fans were reacting, it was crazy, and it was giving us even more strength, it was giving me a lot of hope.</p><p>O : Who\u2019ll summarize s3 for me?</p><p>A : Ohlala, ohlala</p><p>Max :Summarize it?</p><p>O : Summarize it yeah. The story, the plot.</p><p>Max : wow</p><p>O : You were in it!</p><p>Max : Yes yes! Is that true? Oh yeah it was such a long time ago!</p><p>Mar : You have a pretty important role!</p><p>A : Your questions are hard! Summarize it just like that</p><p>Max : Summarize, uh\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 To summarize it, it\u2019s the story of a young high-schooler who\u2019s called lucas, who\u2019s questioning his sexuality, and who\u2019s discovering himself and accepting himself as gay little by little, going through steps as friends, the girl he uses as a beard, then people at school, parents, etc. To finally try to live his love story correctly.</p><p>O : It\u2019s a good summary.</p><p>Max :Is it fine?</p><p>O : It was really cool</p><p>Max : My hands are all clammy! </p><p>O : Okay okay chill. So a question a bit simpler, do you have a moment that marked you in that season?</p><p>A : For season 3? Oh the party. Infiltration. Oh that was sooo cool to shot.</p><p>M : It was very very cool to shot. Infiltration, well I arrived in the end so I was under a blanket in the \u201ccombo\u201d room. But yeah it was a great shooting day. All in costumes\u2026</p><p>A : We shot it at night and each time it was so cool cause we would put the music full volume, and each time because there were moments where we had to cut the music for sound, and we had to keep on dancing, it\u2019s not easy, but it was so good, frankly we were such in a good mood, and we had the costumes, we loved the costumes we had and everything</p><p>Max : And there were a lot of extras, who were into it 3000%, as much as we were, and, very very cool to shot and you know as you say we\u2019re pretty young, our high school years are not so far, so being in character, to have a party a bit\u2026 I don\u2019t have the word can you help me?</p><p>J : Secret/clandestine</p><p>M : Secret/clandestine yes! In a school like that, it brings you back - well i never did this when i was in high school - but it\u2019s cool. It feels good.</p><p>A : it was so cool</p><p>J :So both the party</p><p>Max : Not for me. Well yeah clearly the party, but since I was not on set a lot\u2026 For me the scene that marked me the most was the paint scene. The mural. Because it was the scene that asked us to let go the most. I\u2019m really talking as an actor, not the scene that I preferred shooting or anything, but it\u2019s really\u2026 Well, when we finished shooting it, we looked at each other with Axel and were like \u201cfuck, we\u2019re actually capable of doing that kind of thing, and we\u2019re capable of letting go of everything and to dedicate ourselves 300% to our director, first of all, and to our roles, and also to the audience. And-</p><p>Mar : How did you make the paint go after?</p><p>Max : we were under the shower for one hour, one hour and a half. And uh, yeah, it was everywhere. Ears, teeth. It was hell. Yeah</p><p>J : It\u2019s true that, it\u2019s not nothing, for a first\u2026 It was really the first time that you were acting in front of a camera, so it\u2019s not nothing</p><p>Max : Yeah. Yeah. And a sex scene too.</p><p>J : Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Max : So, it was\u2026</p><p>J : A nice achievement</p><p>Max : A nice\u2026 Yeah. A nice\u2026 Yeah. No but I was happy, you see. I was happy, I\u2019m telling myself, at least I will have lived a love story with a guy one day in my life, since\u2026 yeah, and, no it was very very cool\u2026 Uh, then I have thousands of beautiful memories, like, all of the\u2026 all of the boat scene, we arrived in this boat that they had decorated beforehand, we saw all of that, really we discovered it during the scene, and that was crazy\u2026 No but actually everything was great. No but that\u2019s true! Each time I\u2019m telling you about something there\u2019s another one coming on my mind, now I\u2019m thinking about the petite ceinture, we have hundreds of stories (tell them all you coward) about each day of filming, so\u2026</p><p>O : And when you watch the show, isn\u2019t there a scene where you tell yourself \"okay that\u2019s a strong scene that\u2019s gonna impact people\u201d? A specific scene?</p><p>Max : For me there was the scene of the first kiss under the rain that killed me, yeah (been there done that). It\u2019s the first time where watching skam, well it comes quite fast, but, where I manged to watch without seeing myself. You see?</p><p>A : Oh yeah? That\u2019s hard!</p><p>Max : It\u2019s super hard.</p><p>A : It\u2019s super hard </p><p>Max : It\u2019s super hard, because you judge yourself quite a lot, as you were saying, you judge yourself a lot, you look, you tell yourself \u201cfuck, why didn\u2019t I do this or that\u201d and actually, actually we were so into the filming that at first I didn\u2019t notice- because the whole Eliott\u2019s film thing came after we filmed this scene, or maybe before I don\u2019t know but I had forgotten about it. And actually, when I rewatch the thing\u2026 At first, I didn\u2019t understand why David would make us hold our hands up like this (MAXENCE SKDKDKFKFSJDJDKD). Really, before kissing, I didn\u2019t understand. And all of a sudden, I watch and i realize while watching the episode. So that\u2019s the scene that gave me a big slap in the face, because I had completely missed it.</p><p>J : Yeah you didn\u2019t connected at all\u2026</p><p>O : Connected with what? With the fact it matches your project?</p><p>Max : The fact that actually, Lucas and Eliott\u2019s first kiss-</p><p>O : I hadn\u2019t realize, I hadn\u2019t noticed at all (w o w)</p><p>Max : You see?</p><p>J : But yes! Actually, the movie project is exactly the same scene</p><p>Max : Yeah. It\u2019s exactly the same that happens, the tunnel, the hands up, they join, bam they end up-</p><p>O : You had all realized that?</p><p>Everyone around the table, me, y'all, Obama : Well yeah</p><p>O : Okay\u2026 That\u2019s dope! And you Assa, was there an impactful scene when you were watching season 3?</p><p>A : For me the scene that marked me the most is the paint scene! And I remember, when they were filming, with the girls we were in the dressing rooms, and we wanted to watch the scene so bad! But David said no way, no one watches the scene, and after when we discovered the scene we were like \u201coh yeah, oh yeah that was really hot!\u201d</p><p>Max : Clearly. Not but it\u2019s beautiful, you see even us when we were looking at ourselves in the end we were all green, brown, black, you know like disgusting mixed painting, and on screen it comes off so well! Every color is here, and i was very afraid of it looking like sort of mud, green/black you know, a bit like when you\u2019re a kid and you mix  up every paint color in your plate, and finally it comes off really really well yeah.</p><p>O : even the fans loved this scene, no? Marine?</p><p>Mar : Ah yes, yes, completely. We got lots of hearts.</p><p>Max : Yeah? Every color?</p><p>Mar : Every color obviously.</p><p>O : And I\u2019ll ask you too, the scenes that impacted you in s3?</p><p>J : My impactful scene from s3\u2026 It\u2019s when Lucas gets outed by Chlo\u00e9, because I though that was super important to talk about it. By the way we\u2019re gonna take this opportunity to say, don\u2019t out people (listen to what the lady\u2019s saying kids). Uh, yeah.</p><p>O : What is outing people?</p><p>J : Outing, outing is- See i wrote it so I won\u2019t say stupid things. Outing is basically reveal someone\u2019s homosexuality, bisexuality or trans intensity, without asking- without their consent. So yeah you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s violating someone\u2019s privacy, and there\u2019s also a path, it\u2019s up to people to decide the moment to come out, if they wanna do it or not by the way. Anyways, you don\u2019t out people. So I thought it was important to\u2026 For me this scene was super important, cause we often talk about coming out but we don\u2019t talk about that thing that is outing, which is something super violent, and so for me that scene was essential, and it realkuy marked me, and especially I found it very well acted by Axel (y e s)</p><p>Max : That\u2019s what I was going to say yeah, Axel Auriant is outstanding in this scene.</p><p>J : This scene killed me, really, I cried. And I saw it, i think it was at the screening</p><p>Max : Yeah, it was</p><p>J : Cause I saw it on big screen so\u2026 With eddy de pretto as the background music, and the punch in the door. By the way, maybe you\u2019re gonna confirm this but I think he really punched for real</p><p>A : Yeah apparently. Apparently he really hurted himself</p><p>Max : Yeah, he really\u2026 Well, it was makeup on his fingers but he really smashed his hand yeah. Yeah.</p><p>J : But really, well I cried\u2026 (been there done that part 2) And really for me this scene is the most impactful and especially it\u2019s very important. Here. So to say it again, don\u2019t out people please.</p><p>Max : Be careful</p><p>A : Oh yeah and I just thought about it, there\u2019s a scene that impacted me a lot too in s3, it\u2019s the moment where he\u2019s at church, and then there\u2019s the music\u2026 This one! And with the music adding up, that music is just perfect</p><p>O : I was listening to it on a loop!</p><p>J : It\u2019s good</p><p>A : I downloaded it right away. I really loved the song frankly, and after when he starts running and he\u2019s joining Eliott, this scene is crazy, frankly I loved it, so beautiful</p><p>O : What about you Marine do you have a scene?</p><p>Mar : There\u2019s a scene I loved a lot, it\u2019s the dialogue in between Lucas and Mika on the couch, I don\u2019t know if you see? Where basically Lucas starts saying there\u2019s something going on with Eliott, but that at the same time he doesn\u2019t want to say he\u2019s gay because he\u2019s not considering himself a stereotyped gay, and i think it\u2019s quite representative of what can happen at this age, what Lucas expresses is what society can think about gay people, and that\u2019s a sort of homophobia that he internalized, he wants to get out of it but he doesn\u2019t really know who is he is actually. And I found this strong, after that, the message that mika was passing saying it was out people who were helping the cause,and i found that strong. And I thought it was a nice political message but passed really smoothly, it was nice.</p><p>O : That\u2019s true that, I was wondering, while you\u2019re filming, do you tell yourself \u201cthere are people watching, maybe it\u2019s gonna change things\u201d</p><p>Max : No</p><p>A : No, frankly not at all</p><p>Max : Well I don\u2019t know who\u2019s working what way, but, I know how Axel works at least, and  we have pretty much the same way of working that is to say, we\u2019re our characters from 8am to 8pm if we\u2019re filming, if we\u2019re filming until 5am we\u2019re our characters until 5am, and actually we don\u2019t think about the message, and it\u2019s a bit- when you act a scene you have to think about yourself, and what your character lives at the moment, you should not think about the impact you could have cause it\u2019s getting you out of your role, it brings you back to you\u2026 To me Maxence, for example, or to Assa or\u2026 Except we\u2019re not ourselves on set. So you really shouldn\u2019t think about the result, basically. That\u2019s it.</p><p>J : Anyways that\u2019s more of David\u2019s job. He makes you act something, but because he has an idea in his directing about where he wants things to go.</p><p>Max :Yeah but you don\u2019t think about a message. Well. The message, you see it when you read your script, first reading, you tell yourself \u201coh that\u2019s cool, bam bam bam\u201d</p><p>A : And especially when you discover. When I discover the episodes I tell myself \u201coh yeah I understand David better now! He wanted to do that\u201d because on set, we act and we don\u2019t think about after, we don\u2019t think about how the scene is gonna be perceived by the audience, we\u2019re really in our characters and\u2026</p><p>O : He doesn\u2019t brief you at all on this?</p><p>Max : No because it\u2019s not important</p><p>A : Yeah it\u2019s not useful. He just briefes us about how we have to act. How we have to feel things and how we have to act, it\u2019s really not\u2026</p><p>Max : Because if we act bad, the messages won\u2019t be passed. If we fail our scenes, if we\u2019re not true in what we say during our scenes, the messages won\u2019t pass. Actually, the messages are a bit the result of all of the processus we put in place to create our character and-</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>Max : Yeah. And that\u2019s what\u2019s magical in being an actor.

Of, well of skam. And uh, and yeah. And it\u2019s enough.</p><p>O : It\u2019s very good, it\u2019s very good like this</p><p>J : And wait we forgot to tell about you!</p><p>O : Oh yeah me! Who am I? Introduce me</p><p>Max : That one\u2019s for you</p><p>A : Why is it for me?</p><p>Max : Because you know him! </p><p>A : So here\u2019s Oumar Diaou</p><p>J : No, Diawara</p><p>A : Diawara</p><p>O : She doesn\u2019t know my name!</p><p>A : Sorry. We\u2019re doing it again</p><p>O : We\u2019ll cut while editing</p><p>J : No</p><p>A : Okay, so that\u2019s Oumar Diawara, he\u2019s the host of the Moonwalk show, that I encourage you all to watch it\u2019s so good</p><p>O : So today, we\u2019re going to talk about Skam france, we\u2019re gonna do a debrief from s3, from s4 of the show too, and ask you some questions about this. Are you ready?</p><p>O : So the first question is a bit simple but how do you feel after s3 and 4 aired?</p><p>A : So good</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>A : I think, and it\u2019s such a relief</p><p>Max : Proud too</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : Why proud?</p><p>Max : Well proud that\u2026 That we had such an impact, and that the message that we tried to send was like, transmitted the right way and, and to so many people.</p><p>O : Do you think it changed the life of some people?</p><p>A : Totally</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that\u2019s true, that\u2019s true.</p><p>A : We often get messages on social media, where a lot of people are thanking us for this show, are telling us \u201cthank you, Skam changed my life, thank you i finally saw myself represented on tv, thank you cause I finally understand\u201d, and that\u2019s, that\u2019s great, that\u2019s so good</p><p>O : And your life changed too i think</p><p>Max : A bit yeah</p><p>A : A bit yeah</p><p>Max : A little yeah</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : In what way did it change?</p><p>Max : Well we\u2019re invited to shows\u2026</p><p>A : Yeah, we\u2019re here, we\u2019re here!</p><p>O : With Oumar Diaou!</p><p>Max : No it changes life, [I can\u2019t understand shit] is so practical!</p><p>O : the little joke! Such a kid</p><p>A : Yeah, a real one.</p><p>Max : Yeah, for real, it made me discover new subway lines,</p><p>A : No, but for real, we get credit for what we do, we\u2019re doing talk shows, interviews, and for real for me personally it didn\u2019t really change my life cause I\u2019m always the same but it still changed\u2026</p><p>Max : It didn\u2019t change us as people, but it changed a bit-</p><p>A : our daily lives</p><p>Max : Exactly, our daily lives.</p><p>O : People\u2019s judgment too.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>Max : People\u2019s judgment yeah\u2026 Yeah, yeah it\u2019s true. And yeah, all this thing, all this wave that assaulted us a bit, that we didn\u2019t expect at all, be it us or you or anyone actually. And that\u2019s true that yeah it changes quite a lot of things cause we get stopped in the street, even when we go to screenings, well.</p><p>J : And you were a bit worried by the way, in the start, about that. It was really impressive to you</p><p>Max : It was my first project, so what was the most impressive to me was to be in front of a camera cause I was just out of school, I was a baby I had never acted, and after that yeah, all of this infatuation that arrived all of a sudden. And when it\u2019s a first thing that you do, you\u2019ve never been used to handle promotion even on a movie with less, you know, less\u2026 How can you call that? Of\u2026</p><p>J : Buzz/turmoil ?</p><p>Max : Buzz/turmoil (that sounds stupid sjdkdkd I\u2019m sorry the word is just not really translatable) ! That\u2019s the word I was looking for. Uh, well at this moment all of a sudden you\u2019re thrown in the lions\u2019 pit and you have to handle promo, you have to handle speeches that are a bit sensible, where you can get a bit destroyed by both sides in some ways, you know. And you find yourself in this and\u2026 So yeah that\u2019s, that\u2019s\u2026. That\u2019s scary</p><p>J : And you\u2019re really careful about the aim of your words. You were really careful. Cause I interviewed him, maxence, and he was very very careful, from the start already you were\u2026 First of all very impressed cause it was, I think the second screening. Which was\u2026</p><p>Max : Oh yeah! In the small leather seats?</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>J : And, I noticed that you were really careful about the words you were choosing, you really cared for that</p><p>Max : Yeah, well because, because you know sometimes in a bit of a stupid way- and it\u2019s also the message we want to pass with skam, in our season for example, about homophobia and everything, sometimes you\u2019re just not careful, and you say something stupid, because it\u2019s like a thing you say without thinking since middle school or something, and, or sometimes you express yourself badly, and you can be bashed a lot actually. Cause that\u2019s also the \u201ctwo sides\u2019 of that thing, of that buzz. Cause on one hand yes we get a lot of love and etc, but if you say one word out of the way, you can be destroyed really really fast, cause we\u2019re on, well, unfortunately sensitive topics. It can be sometimes difficult to\u2026 Well, I express myself freely cause that\u2019s really, well that\u2019s how I think and that\u2019s the way I am, I would\u2019ve never done such a project otherwise, but everything can be distorted, very fast, not making the cut and\u2026 You can get beaten up real fast</p><p>O : no one\u2019s gonna ask for that not to make the cut! He\u2019s afraid we\u2019ll frame him!</p><p>A : But in the end it went well</p><p>Max : In the end it went really well</p><p>A : yeah</p><p>O : And especially to live that being that young, because Assa I think you\u2019re 23, you 24</p><p>Max : 25. 26 next week</p><p>O : 25? I saw 1994 on the internet</p><p>Max : It\u2019s false</p><p>O : Oh shit!</p><p>Max : 93</p><p>O : Everyone got it wrong. Okay, now we have the info that\u2019s cool. So yeah to live that being this young, isn\u2019t it hard?</p><p>A : I don\u2019t really know</p><p>Max : I\u2019ll admit I had a bit of a down at some point. That is to say that the first month, month and a half i loved it, except that in fact, since it went higher and higher we gave a lot, it being me, Axel, David, well all of the cast, and we gave a lot to people, and we didn\u2019t really protect ourselves. Which lead to me having around March a period while I was down about all that cause you get a lot of energy in your face, cause people are coming with their stories, either very beautiful or very hard, and they\u2019re telling it to you as if you were their best friend almost,</p><p>A : Yeah that\u2019s super hard</p><p>O : You have messages a bit\u2026</p><p>A :Yeah, it was really very very hard to read, and i told myself \"I don\u2019t even know what to answer, cause\u2026\u201d Yeah, there are messages that are really, really hard</p><p>Max : And actually you have to learn to put this aside and to tell yourself it\u2019s not about you, but your actor, your character. And sometimes the border is a bit complicated cause then during the screenings it\u2019s us that have to handle people, except that they relate to the character that your interpreted, and since they\u2019re very close to our personality, because that\u2019s how skam is they\u2019re writing the characters depending on us too, the border is a bit hard to handle for them, and for me personally it was even a bit hard at some point for me, cause I was waking up on mornings and was like \u201cfuck, wait\u201d</p><p>O : Who is who</p><p>Max : Yeah, who feels what, and\u2026</p><p>J : What am I feeling!</p><p>O : And on slash\u2019s side, how did we live it. I know that us, with clips airing and etc, we were really centered on skam. You Marine, you handle the instagram of slash, you got a lot of texts.</p><p>Mar : Yeah, cause every Monday we were airing a story, and we had each time either people telling us that we were a bit sadistic to make us relive the event that happened so they were even more down- either they were crying or we also got a lot of love- or they were really impatient to know more so they would ask when the clip was gonna come out, and it was\u2026 It was pretty impressive yeah.</p><p>O : And I think there were also people that were a bit like \u201cyeah, you\u2019re taking time airing the clips\u201d</p><p>Mar :Yeah, totally. Before Fridays we had a bit of pressure</p><p>J : Yeah we had pressure! Even on YouTube if we were publishing something else than skam, they were trolling us a little in the comments</p><p>O : Moonwalk comments are always like \u201cwhere is skam?\u201d. I was so disappointed!</p><p>Mar : People asking us also to translate in Spanish, in English, every story cause they couldn\u2019t translate. And last week a very funny message, someone who wrote \u201cI can see a show that looks great, but I don\u2019t know what that is\u201d, so there are still people not watching</p><p>Max : That\u2019s great</p><p>A : That\u2019s crazy</p><p>J :That\u2019s good!</p><p>O : Yeah totally, people are knowing it more and more. And you Judith, do you have a specific memory?</p><p>J : My specific memory is more about the fans, who were doing a lot of things, in between drawings..</p><p>Max :tattoos</p><p>J : tattoos, that\u2019s true there are poeple that got tattoos.</p><p>A : Oh I didn\u2019t know!</p><p>Max :Yeah that\u2019s crazy</p><p>J : And I did, by the way hi Marianne - I did a small video for Marianne who made a song</p><p>Max :Oh you were the one to do it? So cool!</p><p>J : About season 3 and 4, well no season 3, the lucas and eliott season. And she wrote a very beautiful song and we made her a little acoustic session. And yeah, it\u2019s one of my biggest memories around skam cause, the idea was also for France tv slash to give back all of this infatuation with Skam\u2019s community, and it was a small gesture to show \u201cthat\u2019s cool, keep on going!\u201d. A very beautiful community. So big kisses to Marianne by the way.</p><p>O : The screenings by the way, I came to one of the screenings and it\u2019s true that it\u2019s quite crazy. Like people react to each clip like crazy\u2026 How do you react?</p><p>Max : Do you want to start?</p><p>Mar :And you\u2019re discovering yourselves almost.</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that\u2019s it, we\u2019re discovering ourselves, we were discovering ourselves live on a theater. And when you\u2019re in the main roles, well Assa was a main and i was a pivotal role around Lucas, it\u2019s- you\u2019re on screen a lot so you see yourself a lot, and\u2026 Had you already seen yourself act before?</p><p>A :Yeah</p><p>Max : Okay. I had never seen myself on screen. Oh yeah Bande de filles (Assa\u2019s previous movie) that\u2019s true. And yeah during the first screening clearly I finished the screening approximately like that [he\u2019s like crumpled in the bottom of his seat] on my cinema seat. Ah yeah, I was not good. I was not good at all. And finally you start playing the game little by little, you get used to it a bit, but you always have the little shot, we were talking about it five minutes ago, always the little adrenaline shot before arriving cause, cause yeah you\u2019re\u2026 It\u2019s still very disturbing. Yeah</p><p>Mar : Did you rewatch the clips at home, without an audience?</p><p>Max : Uh, not, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not watching it a lot. Yeah. I watch the episodes when they come out and etc, I watched s4 normally, because I\u2019m almost not in it, so it was perfect, but it\u2019s a bit weird to be home alone and to watch yourself on your computer\u2026 It\u2019s cool to watch it, i was watching it with friends, or, yeah.</p><p>A : Yeah I was always watching with friends too. But I was still watching the clips. Because I had to watch it was stressing me out</p><p>J : Why is it stressing you out?</p><p>A :Well actually, as for the screenings, I already saw myself to the cinema, but it\u2019s still always as hard to see yourself actually. And during screenings you see yourself in huge, while we usually watch on our phone or computer, and you see yourself on big screen and i see all of my flaws I tell myself \u201cfuck why did you make that face, why did you do that\u201d and it makes me crazy really. But yeah frankly screenings were really impressive. Especially the way fans were reacting, it was crazy, and it was giving us even more strength, it was giving me a lot of hope.</p><p>O : Who\u2019ll summarize s3 for me?</p><p>A : Ohlala, ohlala</p><p>Max :Summarize it?</p><p>O : Summarize it yeah. The story, the plot.</p><p>Max : wow</p><p>O : You were in it!</p><p>Max : Yes yes! Is that true? Oh yeah it was such a long time ago!</p><p>Mar : You have a pretty important role!</p><p>A : Your questions are hard! Summarize it just like that</p><p>Max : Summarize, uh\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 To summarize it, it\u2019s the story of a young high-schooler who\u2019s called lucas, who\u2019s questioning his sexuality, and who\u2019s discovering himself and accepting himself as gay little by little, going through steps as friends, the girl he uses as a beard, then people at school, parents, etc. To finally try to live his love story correctly.</p><p>O : It\u2019s a good summary.</p><p>Max :Is it fine?</p><p>O : It was really cool</p><p>Max : My hands are all clammy! </p><p>O : Okay okay chill. So a question a bit simpler, do you have a moment that marked you in that season?</p><p>A : For season 3? Oh the party. Infiltration. Oh that was sooo cool to shot.</p><p>M : It was very very cool to shot. Infiltration, well I arrived in the end so I was under a blanket in the \u201ccombo\u201d room. But yeah it was a great shooting day. All in costumes\u2026</p><p>A : We shot it at night and each time it was so cool cause we would put the music full volume, and each time because there were moments where we had to cut the music for sound, and we had to keep on dancing, it\u2019s not easy, but it was so good, frankly we were such in a good mood, and we had the costumes, we loved the costumes we had and everything</p><p>Max : And there were a lot of extras, who were into it 3000%, as much as we were, and, very very cool to shot and you know as you say we\u2019re pretty young, our high school years are not so far, so being in character, to have a party a bit\u2026 I don\u2019t have the word can you help me?</p><p>J : Secret/clandestine</p><p>M : Secret/clandestine yes! In a school like that, it brings you back - well i never did this when i was in high school - but it\u2019s cool. It feels good.</p><p>A : it was so cool</p><p>J :So both the party</p><p>Max : Not for me. Well yeah clearly the party, but since I was not on set a lot\u2026 For me the scene that marked me the most was the paint scene. The mural. Because it was the scene that asked us to let go the most. I\u2019m really talking as an actor, not the scene that I preferred shooting or anything, but it\u2019s really\u2026 Well, when we finished shooting it, we looked at each other with Axel and were like \u201cfuck, we\u2019re actually capable of doing that kind of thing, and we\u2019re capable of letting go of everything and to dedicate ourselves 300% to our director, first of all, and to our roles, and also to the audience. And-</p><p>Mar : How did you make the paint go after?</p><p>Max : we were under the shower for one hour, one hour and a half. And uh, yeah, it was everywhere. Ears, teeth. It was hell. Yeah</p><p>J : It\u2019s true that, it\u2019s not nothing, for a first\u2026 It was really the first time that you were acting in front of a camera, so it\u2019s not nothing</p><p>Max : Yeah. Yeah. And a sex scene too.</p><p>J : Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Max : So, it was\u2026</p><p>J : A nice achievement</p><p>Max : A nice\u2026 Yeah. A nice\u2026 Yeah. No but I was happy, you see. I was happy, I\u2019m telling myself, at least I will have lived a love story with a guy one day in my life, since\u2026 yeah, and, no it was very very cool\u2026 Uh, then I have thousands of beautiful memories, like, all of the\u2026 all of the boat scene, we arrived in this boat that they had decorated beforehand, we saw all of that, really we discovered it during the scene, and that was crazy\u2026 No but actually everything was great. No but that\u2019s true! Each time I\u2019m telling you about something there\u2019s another one coming on my mind, now I\u2019m thinking about the petite ceinture, we have hundreds of stories (tell them all you coward) about each day of filming, so\u2026</p><p>O : And when you watch the show, isn\u2019t there a scene where you tell yourself \"okay that\u2019s a strong scene that\u2019s gonna impact people\u201d? A specific scene?</p><p>Max : For me there was the scene of the first kiss under the rain that killed me, yeah (been there done that). It\u2019s the first time where watching skam, well it comes quite fast, but, where I manged to watch without seeing myself. You see?</p><p>A : Oh yeah? That\u2019s hard!</p><p>Max : It\u2019s super hard.</p><p>A : It\u2019s super hard </p><p>Max : It\u2019s super hard, because you judge yourself quite a lot, as you were saying, you judge yourself a lot, you look, you tell yourself \u201cfuck, why didn\u2019t I do this or that\u201d and actually, actually we were so into the filming that at first I didn\u2019t notice- because the whole Eliott\u2019s film thing came after we filmed this scene, or maybe before I don\u2019t know but I had forgotten about it. And actually, when I rewatch the thing\u2026 At first, I didn\u2019t understand why David would make us hold our hands up like this (MAXENCE SKDKDKFKFSJDJDKD). Really, before kissing, I didn\u2019t understand. And all of a sudden, I watch and i realize while watching the episode. So that\u2019s the scene that gave me a big slap in the face, because I had completely missed it.</p><p>J : Yeah you didn\u2019t connected at all\u2026</p><p>O : Connected with what? With the fact it matches your project?</p><p>Max : The fact that actually, Lucas and Eliott\u2019s first kiss-</p><p>O : I hadn\u2019t realize, I hadn\u2019t noticed at all (w o w)</p><p>Max : You see?</p><p>J : But yes! Actually, the movie project is exactly the same scene</p><p>Max : Yeah. It\u2019s exactly the same that happens, the tunnel, the hands up, they join, bam they end up-</p><p>O : You had all realized that?</p><p>Everyone around the table, me, y'all, Obama : Well yeah</p><p>O : Okay\u2026 That\u2019s dope! And you Assa, was there an impactful scene when you were watching season 3?</p><p>A : For me the scene that marked me the most is the paint scene! And I remember, when they were filming, with the girls we were in the dressing rooms, and we wanted to watch the scene so bad! But David said no way, no one watches the scene, and after when we discovered the scene we were like \u201coh yeah, oh yeah that was really hot!\u201d</p><p>Max : Clearly. Not but it\u2019s beautiful, you see even us when we were looking at ourselves in the end we were all green, brown, black, you know like disgusting mixed painting, and on screen it comes off so well! Every color is here, and i was very afraid of it looking like sort of mud, green/black you know, a bit like when you\u2019re a kid and you mix  up every paint color in your plate, and finally it comes off really really well yeah.</p><p>O : even the fans loved this scene, no? Marine?</p><p>Mar : Ah yes, yes, completely. We got lots of hearts.</p><p>Max : Yeah? Every color?</p><p>Mar : Every color obviously.</p><p>O : And I\u2019ll ask you too, the scenes that impacted you in s3?</p><p>J : My impactful scene from s3\u2026 It\u2019s when Lucas gets outed by Chlo\u00e9, because I though that was super important to talk about it. By the way we\u2019re gonna take this opportunity to say, don\u2019t out people (listen to what the lady\u2019s saying kids). Uh, yeah.</p><p>O : What is outing people?</p><p>J : Outing, outing is- See i wrote it so I won\u2019t say stupid things. Outing is basically reveal someone\u2019s homosexuality, bisexuality or trans intensity, without asking- without their consent. So yeah you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s violating someone\u2019s privacy, and there\u2019s also a path, it\u2019s up to people to decide the moment to come out, if they wanna do it or not by the way. Anyways, you don\u2019t out people. So I thought it was important to\u2026 For me this scene was super important, cause we often talk about coming out but we don\u2019t talk about that thing that is outing, which is something super violent, and so for me that scene was essential, and it realkuy marked me, and especially I found it very well acted by Axel (y e s)</p><p>Max : That\u2019s what I was going to say yeah, Axel Auriant is outstanding in this scene.</p><p>J : This scene killed me, really, I cried. And I saw it, i think it was at the screening</p><p>Max : Yeah, it was</p><p>J : Cause I saw it on big screen so\u2026 With eddy de pretto as the background music, and the punch in the door. By the way, maybe you\u2019re gonna confirm this but I think he really punched for real</p><p>A : Yeah apparently. Apparently he really hurted himself</p><p>Max : Yeah, he really\u2026 Well, it was makeup on his fingers but he really smashed his hand yeah. Yeah.</p><p>J : But really, well I cried\u2026 (been there done that part 2) And really for me this scene is the most impactful and especially it\u2019s very important. Here. So to say it again, don\u2019t out people please.</p><p>Max : Be careful</p><p>A : Oh yeah and I just thought about it, there\u2019s a scene that impacted me a lot too in s3, it\u2019s the moment where he\u2019s at church, and then there\u2019s the music\u2026 This one! And with the music adding up, that music is just perfect</p><p>O : I was listening to it on a loop!</p><p>J : It\u2019s good</p><p>A : I downloaded it right away. I really loved the song frankly, and after when he starts running and he\u2019s joining Eliott, this scene is crazy, frankly I loved it, so beautiful</p><p>O : What about you Marine do you have a scene?</p><p>Mar : There\u2019s a scene I loved a lot, it\u2019s the dialogue in between Lucas and Mika on the couch, I don\u2019t know if you see? Where basically Lucas starts saying there\u2019s something going on with Eliott, but that at the same time he doesn\u2019t want to say he\u2019s gay because he\u2019s not considering himself a stereotyped gay, and i think it\u2019s quite representative of what can happen at this age, what Lucas expresses is what society can think about gay people, and that\u2019s a sort of homophobia that he internalized, he wants to get out of it but he doesn\u2019t really know who is he is actually. And I found this strong, after that, the message that mika was passing saying it was out people who were helping the cause,and i found that strong. And I thought it was a nice political message but passed really smoothly, it was nice.</p><p>O : That\u2019s true that, I was wondering, while you\u2019re filming, do you tell yourself \u201cthere are people watching, maybe it\u2019s gonna change things\u201d</p><p>Max : No</p><p>A : No, frankly not at all</p><p>Max : Well I don\u2019t know who\u2019s working what way, but, I know how Axel works at least, and  we have pretty much the same way of working that is to say, we\u2019re our characters from 8am to 8pm if we\u2019re filming, if we\u2019re filming until 5am we\u2019re our characters until 5am, and actually we don\u2019t think about the message, and it\u2019s a bit- when you act a scene you have to think about yourself, and what your character lives at the moment, you should not think about the impact you could have cause it\u2019s getting you out of your role, it brings you back to you\u2026 To me Maxence, for example, or to Assa or\u2026 Except we\u2019re not ourselves on set. So you really shouldn\u2019t think about the result, basically. That\u2019s it.</p><p>J : Anyways that\u2019s more of David\u2019s job. He makes you act something, but because he has an idea in his directing about where he wants things to go.</p><p>Max :Yeah but you don\u2019t think about a message. Well. The message, you see it when you read your script, first reading, you tell yourself \u201coh that\u2019s cool, bam bam bam\u201d</p><p>A : And especially when you discover. When I discover the episodes I tell myself \u201coh yeah I understand David better now! He wanted to do that\u201d because on set, we act and we don\u2019t think about after, we don\u2019t think about how the scene is gonna be perceived by the audience, we\u2019re really in our characters and\u2026</p><p>O : He doesn\u2019t brief you at all on this?</p><p>Max : No because it\u2019s not important</p><p>A : Yeah it\u2019s not useful. He just briefes us about how we have to act. How we have to feel things and how we have to act, it\u2019s really not\u2026</p><p>Max : Because if we act bad, the messages won\u2019t be passed. If we fail our scenes, if we\u2019re not true in what we say during our scenes, the messages won\u2019t pass. Actually, the messages are a bit the result of all of the processus we put in place to create our character and-</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>Max : Yeah. And that\u2019s what\u2019s magical in being an actor. It\u2019s that, you see, you\u2019re alone in your room working on your scripts, working on your stuff, on set you\u2019re focused you\u2019re not thinking about anything else, and all of a sudden it\u2019s out and you see the impact</p><p>A : Really, it\u2019s exactly that</p><p>Max :And it\u2019s really the most beautiful gift of our job</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : We\u2019re moving on to the debate</p><p>J : Yeah, we\u2019re going to do a debate</p><p>Max : And we don\u2019t talk about season 4?</p><p>J : Yes we do!</p><p>O : right after</p><p>Max : It\u2019s my favorite [?]</p><p>J : right after. There\u2019s a debate about s3 then debate about s4, and they\u2019re really important debates.</p><p>Max : okay</p><p>J : Ie, a debate about Eliott actually, are we for or against- Are Eliott\u2019s flirting techniques that good? (bitch\u2026\u2026. yes) What do you think about it?</p><p><i>okay I\u2019ll stop there for now and i\u2019m continuing the other half right away on another post, sorry this is taking so much time </i></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><h2>assa and maxence&rsquo;s interview on france tv slash&rsquo;s youtube channel </h2><p>A : Frankly, you&rsquo;ve been uninteresting since earlier we&rsquo;re bored, you&rsquo;re super lame!</p><p>O : This show is shit!</p><p>O : So hi guys. How are you?</p><p>J : I&rsquo;m fine and you Oumar?</p><p>O : I&rsquo;m fine I&rsquo;m super happy to be with you, for the premiere of the show &ldquo;On slash&rdquo;. So I&rsquo;ll explain the concept quickly. Basically we&rsquo;re gonna talk for an hour, we&rsquo;re gonna do quizzes, we&rsquo;re gonna do debates, and yeah the idea is really to speak freely in between us, casually, around that table. So today I&rsquo;m with two members of the Slash team. I&rsquo;m with Judith, editorial manager of Slash</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>O : That&rsquo;s your name?</p><p>J : Yeah!</p><p>O : Judith. Who&rsquo;s also my boss by the way, on Slash.</p><p>J : Here you go.</p><p>O : So it feels really weird to do a show with your boss, that&rsquo;s the first time, but i&rsquo;m not too stressed</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s gonna be fine</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s gonna be okay. Be careful</p><p>O : And I&rsquo;m also with Marine</p><p>Mar : Who&rsquo;s&hellip; I&rsquo;m not your boss, unfortunately</p><p>O : But who is still the stories manager of France tv slash on instagram, and snapchat</p><p>Mar : Exactly</p><p>O : And our two guests of today : Assa Sylla and Maxence Danet-Fauvel. How are you?</p><p>Max : very good, always</p><p>A : I&rsquo;m very good too.</p><p>O : Can you explain a bit to me who you are and what you&rsquo;re doing in skam?</p><p>A : So, I&rsquo;m Assa Sylla, I come from [undaudible], I play Imane&rsquo;s character. Sana in the norwegian version</p><p>O : So you&rsquo;re the main of Skam&rsquo;s season 4</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>O : And you?</p><p>Max : And I&rsquo;m Maxence, and i play Eliott in season 3. Of, well of skam. And uh, and yeah. And it&rsquo;s enough.</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s very good, it&rsquo;s very good like this</p><p>J : And wait we forgot to tell about you!</p><p>O : Oh yeah me! Who am I? Introduce me</p><p>Max : That one&rsquo;s for you</p><p>A : Why is it for me?</p><p>Max : Because you know him! </p><p>A : So here&rsquo;s Oumar Diaou</p><p>J : No, Diawara</p><p>A : Diawara</p><p>O : She doesn&rsquo;t know my name!</p><p>A : Sorry. We&rsquo;re doing it again</p><p>O : We&rsquo;ll cut while editing</p><p>J : No</p><p>A : Okay, so that&rsquo;s Oumar Diawara, he&rsquo;s the host of the Moonwalk show, that I encourage you all to watch it&rsquo;s so good</p><p>O : So today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about Skam france, we&rsquo;re gonna do a debrief from s3, from s4 of the show too, and ask you some questions about this. Are you ready?</p><p>O : So the first question is a bit simple but how do you feel after s3 and 4 aired?</p><p>A : So good</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>A : I think, and it&rsquo;s such a relief</p><p>Max : Proud too</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : Why proud?</p><p>Max : Well proud that&hellip; That we had such an impact, and that the message that we tried to send was like, transmitted the right way and, and to so many people.</p><p>O : Do you think it changed the life of some people?</p><p>A : Totally</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p><p>A : We often get messages on social media, where a lot of people are thanking us for this show, are telling us &ldquo;thank you, Skam changed my life, thank you i finally saw myself represented on tv, thank you cause I finally understand&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s so good</p><p>O : And your life changed too i think</p><p>Max : A bit yeah</p><p>A : A bit yeah</p><p>Max : A little yeah</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : In what way did it change?</p><p>Max : Well we&rsquo;re invited to shows&hellip;</p><p>A : Yeah, we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re here!</p><p>O : With Oumar Diaou!</p><p>Max : No it changes life, [I can&rsquo;t understand shit] is so practical!</p><p>O : the little joke! Such a kid</p><p>A : Yeah, a real one.</p><p>Max : Yeah, for real, it made me discover new subway lines,</p><p>A : No, but for real, we get credit for what we do, we&rsquo;re doing talk shows, interviews, and for real for me personally it didn&rsquo;t really change my life cause I&rsquo;m always the same but it still changed&hellip;</p><p>Max : It didn&rsquo;t change us as people, but it changed a bit-</p><p>A : our daily lives</p><p>Max : Exactly, our daily lives.</p><p>O : People&rsquo;s judgment too.</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>Max : People&rsquo;s judgment yeah&hellip; Yeah, yeah it&rsquo;s true. And yeah, all this thing, all this wave that assaulted us a bit, that we didn&rsquo;t expect at all, be it us or you or anyone actually. And that&rsquo;s true that yeah it changes quite a lot of things cause we get stopped in the street, even when we go to screenings, well.</p><p>J : And you were a bit worried by the way, in the start, about that. It was really impressive to you</p><p>Max : It was my first project, so what was the most impressive to me was to be in front of a camera cause I was just out of school, I was a baby I had never acted, and after that yeah, all of this infatuation that arrived all of a sudden. And when it&rsquo;s a first thing that you do, you&rsquo;ve never been used to handle promotion even on a movie with less, you know, less&hellip; How can you call that? Of&hellip;</p><p>J : Buzz/turmoil ?</p><p>Max : Buzz/turmoil (that sounds stupid sjdkdkd I&rsquo;m sorry the word is just not really translatable) ! That&rsquo;s the word I was looking for. Uh, well at this moment all of a sudden you&rsquo;re thrown in the lions&rsquo; pit and you have to handle promo, you have to handle speeches that are a bit sensible, where you can get a bit destroyed by both sides in some ways, you know. And you find yourself in this and&hellip; So yeah that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s&hellip;. That&rsquo;s scary</p><p>J : And you&rsquo;re really careful about the aim of your words. You were really careful. Cause I interviewed him, maxence, and he was very very careful, from the start already you were&hellip; First of all very impressed cause it was, I think the second screening. Which was&hellip;</p><p>Max : Oh yeah! In the small leather seats?</p><p>J : Yeah</p><p>Max : Yeah</p><p>J : And, I noticed that you were really careful about the words you were choosing, you really cared for that</p><p>Max : Yeah, well because, because you know sometimes in a bit of a stupid way- and it&rsquo;s also the message we want to pass with skam, in our season for example, about homophobia and everything, sometimes you&rsquo;re just not careful, and you say something stupid, because it&rsquo;s like a thing you say without thinking since middle school or something, and, or sometimes you express yourself badly, and you can be bashed a lot actually. Cause that&rsquo;s also the &ldquo;two sides&rsquo; of that thing, of that buzz. Cause on one hand yes we get a lot of love and etc, but if you say one word out of the way, you can be destroyed really really fast, cause we&rsquo;re on, well, unfortunately sensitive topics. It can be sometimes difficult to&hellip; Well, I express myself freely cause that&rsquo;s really, well that&rsquo;s how I think and that&rsquo;s the way I am, I would&rsquo;ve never done such a project otherwise, but everything can be distorted, very fast, not making the cut and&hellip; You can get beaten up real fast</p><p>O : no one&rsquo;s gonna ask for that not to make the cut! He&rsquo;s afraid we&rsquo;ll frame him!</p><p>A : But in the end it went well</p><p>Max : In the end it went really well</p><p>A : yeah</p><p>O : And especially to live that being that young, because Assa I think you&rsquo;re 23, you 24</p><p>Max : 25. 26 next week</p><p>O : 25? I saw 1994 on the internet</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s false</p><p>O : Oh shit!</p><p>Max : 93</p><p>O : Everyone got it wrong. Okay, now we have the info that&rsquo;s cool. So yeah to live that being this young, isn&rsquo;t it hard?</p><p>A : I don&rsquo;t really know</p><p>Max : I&rsquo;ll admit I had a bit of a down at some point. That is to say that the first month, month and a half i loved it, except that in fact, since it went higher and higher we gave a lot, it being me, Axel, David, well all of the cast, and we gave a lot to people, and we didn&rsquo;t really protect ourselves. Which lead to me having around March a period while I was down about all that cause you get a lot of energy in your face, cause people are coming with their stories, either very beautiful or very hard, and they&rsquo;re telling it to you as if you were their best friend almost,</p><p>A : Yeah that&rsquo;s super hard</p><p>O : You have messages a bit&hellip;</p><p>A :Yeah, it was really very very hard to read, and i told myself \"I don&rsquo;t even know what to answer, cause&hellip;&rdquo; Yeah, there are messages that are really, really hard</p><p>Max : And actually you have to learn to put this aside and to tell yourself it&rsquo;s not about you, but your actor, your character. And sometimes the border is a bit complicated cause then during the screenings it&rsquo;s us that have to handle people, except that they relate to the character that your interpreted, and since they&rsquo;re very close to our personality, because that&rsquo;s how skam is they&rsquo;re writing the characters depending on us too, the border is a bit hard to handle for them, and for me personally it was even a bit hard at some point for me, cause I was waking up on mornings and was like &ldquo;fuck, wait&rdquo;</p><p>O : Who is who</p><p>Max : Yeah, who feels what, and&hellip;</p><p>J : What am I feeling!</p><p>O : And on slash&rsquo;s side, how did we live it. I know that us, with clips airing and etc, we were really centered on skam. You Marine, you handle the instagram of slash, you got a lot of texts.</p><p>Mar : Yeah, cause every Monday we were airing a story, and we had each time either people telling us that we were a bit sadistic to make us relive the event that happened so they were even more down- either they were crying or we also got a lot of love- or they were really impatient to know more so they would ask when the clip was gonna come out, and it was&hellip; It was pretty impressive yeah.</p><p>O : And I think there were also people that were a bit like &ldquo;yeah, you&rsquo;re taking time airing the clips&rdquo;</p><p>Mar :Yeah, totally. Before Fridays we had a bit of pressure</p><p>J : Yeah we had pressure! Even on YouTube if we were publishing something else than skam, they were trolling us a little in the comments</p><p>O : Moonwalk comments are always like &ldquo;where is skam?&rdquo;. I was so disappointed!</p><p>Mar : People asking us also to translate in Spanish, in English, every story cause they couldn&rsquo;t translate. And last week a very funny message, someone who wrote &ldquo;I can see a show that looks great, but I don&rsquo;t know what that is&rdquo;, so there are still people not watching</p><p>Max : That&rsquo;s great</p><p>A : That&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>J :That&rsquo;s good!</p><p>O : Yeah totally, people are knowing it more and more. And you Judith, do you have a specific memory?</p><p>J : My specific memory is more about the fans, who were doing a lot of things, in between drawings..</p><p>Max :tattoos</p><p>J : tattoos, that&rsquo;s true there are poeple that got tattoos.</p><p>A : Oh I didn&rsquo;t know!</p><p>Max :Yeah that&rsquo;s crazy</p><p>J : And I did, by the way hi Marianne - I did a small video for Marianne who made a song</p><p>Max :Oh you were the one to do it? So cool!</p><p>J : About season 3 and 4, well no season 3, the lucas and eliott season. And she wrote a very beautiful song and we made her a little acoustic session. And yeah, it&rsquo;s one of my biggest memories around skam cause, the idea was also for France tv slash to give back all of this infatuation with Skam&rsquo;s community, and it was a small gesture to show &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, keep on going!&rdquo;. A very beautiful community. So big kisses to Marianne by the way.</p><p>O : The screenings by the way, I came to one of the screenings and it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s quite crazy. Like people react to each clip like crazy&hellip; How do you react?</p><p>Max : Do you want to start?</p><p>Mar :And you&rsquo;re discovering yourselves almost.</p><p>Max : Yeah. No but that&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;re discovering ourselves, we were discovering ourselves live on a theater. And when you&rsquo;re in the main roles, well Assa was a main and i was a pivotal role around Lucas, it&rsquo;s- you&rsquo;re on screen a lot so you see yourself a lot, and&hellip; Had you already seen yourself act before?</p><p>A :Yeah</p><p>Max : Okay. I had never seen myself on screen. Oh yeah Bande de filles (Assa&rsquo;s previous movie) that&rsquo;s true. And yeah during the first screening clearly I finished the screening approximately like that [he&rsquo;s like crumpled in the bottom of his seat] on my cinema seat. Ah yeah, I was not good. I was not good at all. And finally you start playing the game little by little, you get used to it a bit, but you always have the little shot, we were talking about it five minutes ago, always the little adrenaline shot before arriving cause, cause yeah you&rsquo;re&hellip; It&rsquo;s still very disturbing. Yeah</p><p>Mar : Did you rewatch the clips at home, without an audience?</p><p>Max : Uh, not, I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m not watching it a lot. Yeah. I watch the episodes when they come out and etc, I watched s4 normally, because I&rsquo;m almost not in it, so it was perfect, but it&rsquo;s a bit weird to be home alone and to watch yourself on your computer&hellip; It&rsquo;s cool to watch it, i was watching it with friends, or, yeah.</p><p>A : Yeah I was always watching with friends too. But I was still watching the clips. Because I had to watch it was stressing me out</p><p>J : Why is it stressing you out?</p><p>A :Well actually, as for the screenings, I already saw myself to the cinema, but it&rsquo;s still always as hard to see yourself actually. And during screenings you see yourself in huge, while we usually watch on our phone or computer, and you see yourself on big screen and i see all of my flaws I tell myself &ldquo;fuck why did you make that face, why did you do that&rdquo; and it makes me crazy really. But yeah frankly screenings were really impressive. Especially the way fans were reacting, it was crazy, and it was giving us even more strength, it was giving me a lot of hope.</p><p>O : Who&rsquo;ll summarize s3 for me?</p><p>A : Ohlala, ohlala</p><p>Max :Summarize it?</p><p>O : Summarize it yeah. The story, the plot.</p><p>Max : wow</p><p>O : You were in it!</p><p>Max : Yes yes! Is that true? Oh yeah it was such a long time ago!</p><p>Mar : You have a pretty important role!</p><p>A : Your questions are hard! Summarize it just like that</p><p>Max : Summarize, uh&hellip; It&rsquo;s&hellip; To summarize it, it&rsquo;s the story of a young high-schooler who&rsquo;s called lucas, who&rsquo;s questioning his sexuality, and who&rsquo;s discovering himself and accepting himself as gay little by little, going through steps as friends, the girl he uses as a beard, then people at school, parents, etc. To finally try to live his love story correctly.</p><p>O : It&rsquo;s a good summary.</p><p>Max :Is it fine?</p><p>O : It was really cool</p><p>Max : My hands are all clammy! </p><p>O : Okay okay chill. So a question a bit simpler, do you have a moment that marked you in that season?</p><p>A : For season 3? Oh the party. Infiltration. Oh that was sooo cool to shot.</p><p>M : It was very very cool to shot. Infiltration, well I arrived in the end so I was under a blanket in the &ldquo;combo&rdquo; room. But yeah it was a great shooting day. All in costumes&hellip;</p><p>A : We shot it at night and each time it was so cool cause we would put the music full volume, and each time because there were moments where we had to cut the music for sound, and we had to keep on dancing, it&rsquo;s not easy, but it was so good, frankly we were such in a good mood, and we had the costumes, we loved the costumes we had and everything</p><p>Max : And there were a lot of extras, who were into it 3000%, as much as we were, and, very very cool to shot and you know as you say we&rsquo;re pretty young, our high school years are not so far, so being in character, to have a party a bit&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have the word can you help me?</p><p>J : Secret/clandestine</p><p>M : Secret/clandestine yes! In a school like that, it brings you back - well i never did this when i was in high school - but it&rsquo;s cool. It feels good.</p><p>A : it was so cool</p><p>J :So both the party</p><p>Max : Not for me. Well yeah clearly the party, but since I was not on set a lot&hellip; For me the scene that marked me the most was the paint scene. The mural. Because it was the scene that asked us to let go the most. I&rsquo;m really talking as an actor, not the scene that I preferred shooting or anything, but it&rsquo;s really&hellip; Well, when we finished shooting it, we looked at each other with Axel and were like &ldquo;fuck, we&rsquo;re actually capable of doing that kind of thing, and we&rsquo;re capable of letting go of everything and to dedicate ourselves 300% to our director, first of all, and to our roles, and also to the audience. And-</p><p>Mar : How did you make the paint go after?</p><p>Max : we were under the shower for one hour, one hour and a half. And uh, yeah, it was everywhere. Ears, teeth. It was hell. Yeah</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s true that, it&rsquo;s not nothing, for a first&hellip; It was really the first time that you were acting in front of a camera, so it&rsquo;s not nothing</p><p>Max : Yeah. Yeah. And a sex scene too.</p><p>J : Yeah, yeah.</p><p>Max : So, it was&hellip;</p><p>J : A nice achievement</p><p>Max : A nice&hellip; Yeah. A nice&hellip; Yeah. No but I was happy, you see. I was happy, I&rsquo;m telling myself, at least I will have lived a love story with a guy one day in my life, since&hellip; yeah, and, no it was very very cool&hellip; Uh, then I have thousands of beautiful memories, like, all of the&hellip; all of the boat scene, we arrived in this boat that they had decorated beforehand, we saw all of that, really we discovered it during the scene, and that was crazy&hellip; No but actually everything was great. No but that&rsquo;s true! Each time I&rsquo;m telling you about something there&rsquo;s another one coming on my mind, now I&rsquo;m thinking about the petite ceinture, we have hundreds of stories (tell them all you coward) about each day of filming, so&hellip;</p><p>O : And when you watch the show, isn&rsquo;t there a scene where you tell yourself \"okay that&rsquo;s a strong scene that&rsquo;s gonna impact people&rdquo;? A specific scene?</p><p>Max : For me there was the scene of the first kiss under the rain that killed me, yeah (been there done that). It&rsquo;s the first time where watching skam, well it comes quite fast, but, where I manged to watch without seeing myself. You see?</p><p>A : Oh yeah? That&rsquo;s hard!</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s super hard.</p><p>A : It&rsquo;s super hard </p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s super hard, because you judge yourself quite a lot, as you were saying, you judge yourself a lot, you look, you tell yourself &ldquo;fuck, why didn&rsquo;t I do this or that&rdquo; and actually, actually we were so into the filming that at first I didn&rsquo;t notice- because the whole Eliott&rsquo;s film thing came after we filmed this scene, or maybe before I don&rsquo;t know but I had forgotten about it. And actually, when I rewatch the thing&hellip; At first, I didn&rsquo;t understand why David would make us hold our hands up like this (MAXENCE SKDKDKFKFSJDJDKD). Really, before kissing, I didn&rsquo;t understand. And all of a sudden, I watch and i realize while watching the episode. So that&rsquo;s the scene that gave me a big slap in the face, because I had completely missed it.</p><p>J : Yeah you didn&rsquo;t connected at all&hellip;</p><p>O : Connected with what? With the fact it matches your project?</p><p>Max : The fact that actually, Lucas and Eliott&rsquo;s first kiss-</p><p>O : I hadn&rsquo;t realize, I hadn&rsquo;t noticed at all (w o w)</p><p>Max : You see?</p><p>J : But yes! Actually, the movie project is exactly the same scene</p><p>Max : Yeah. It&rsquo;s exactly the same that happens, the tunnel, the hands up, they join, bam they end up-</p><p>O : You had all realized that?</p><p>Everyone around the table, me, y'all, Obama : Well yeah</p><p>O : Okay&hellip; That&rsquo;s dope! And you Assa, was there an impactful scene when you were watching season 3?</p><p>A : For me the scene that marked me the most is the paint scene! And I remember, when they were filming, with the girls we were in the dressing rooms, and we wanted to watch the scene so bad! But David said no way, no one watches the scene, and after when we discovered the scene we were like &ldquo;oh yeah, oh yeah that was really hot!&rdquo;</p><p>Max : Clearly. Not but it&rsquo;s beautiful, you see even us when we were looking at ourselves in the end we were all green, brown, black, you know like disgusting mixed painting, and on screen it comes off so well! Every color is here, and i was very afraid of it looking like sort of mud, green/black you know, a bit like when you&rsquo;re a kid and you mix  up every paint color in your plate, and finally it comes off really really well yeah.</p><p>O : even the fans loved this scene, no? Marine?</p><p>Mar : Ah yes, yes, completely. We got lots of hearts.</p><p>Max : Yeah? Every color?</p><p>Mar : Every color obviously.</p><p>O : And I&rsquo;ll ask you too, the scenes that impacted you in s3?</p><p>J : My impactful scene from s3&hellip; It&rsquo;s when Lucas gets outed by Chlo&eacute;, because I though that was super important to talk about it. By the way we&rsquo;re gonna take this opportunity to say, don&rsquo;t out people (listen to what the lady&rsquo;s saying kids). Uh, yeah.</p><p>O : What is outing people?</p><p>J : Outing, outing is- See i wrote it so I won&rsquo;t say stupid things. Outing is basically reveal someone&rsquo;s homosexuality, bisexuality or trans intensity, without asking- without their consent. So yeah you don&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s violating someone&rsquo;s privacy, and there&rsquo;s also a path, it&rsquo;s up to people to decide the moment to come out, if they wanna do it or not by the way. Anyways, you don&rsquo;t out people. So I thought it was important to&hellip; For me this scene was super important, cause we often talk about coming out but we don&rsquo;t talk about that thing that is outing, which is something super violent, and so for me that scene was essential, and it realkuy marked me, and especially I found it very well acted by Axel (y e s)</p><p>Max : That&rsquo;s what I was going to say yeah, Axel Auriant is outstanding in this scene.</p><p>J : This scene killed me, really, I cried. And I saw it, i think it was at the screening</p><p>Max : Yeah, it was</p><p>J : Cause I saw it on big screen so&hellip; With eddy de pretto as the background music, and the punch in the door. By the way, maybe you&rsquo;re gonna confirm this but I think he really punched for real</p><p>A : Yeah apparently. Apparently he really hurted himself</p><p>Max : Yeah, he really&hellip; Well, it was makeup on his fingers but he really smashed his hand yeah. Yeah.</p><p>J : But really, well I cried&hellip; (been there done that part 2) And really for me this scene is the most impactful and especially it&rsquo;s very important. Here. So to say it again, don&rsquo;t out people please.</p><p>Max : Be careful</p><p>A : Oh yeah and I just thought about it, there&rsquo;s a scene that impacted me a lot too in s3, it&rsquo;s the moment where he&rsquo;s at church, and then there&rsquo;s the music&hellip; This one! And with the music adding up, that music is just perfect</p><p>O : I was listening to it on a loop!</p><p>J : It&rsquo;s good</p><p>A : I downloaded it right away. I really loved the song frankly, and after when he starts running and he&rsquo;s joining Eliott, this scene is crazy, frankly I loved it, so beautiful</p><p>O : What about you Marine do you have a scene?</p><p>Mar : There&rsquo;s a scene I loved a lot, it&rsquo;s the dialogue in between Lucas and Mika on the couch, I don&rsquo;t know if you see? Where basically Lucas starts saying there&rsquo;s something going on with Eliott, but that at the same time he doesn&rsquo;t want to say he&rsquo;s gay because he&rsquo;s not considering himself a stereotyped gay, and i think it&rsquo;s quite representative of what can happen at this age, what Lucas expresses is what society can think about gay people, and that&rsquo;s a sort of homophobia that he internalized, he wants to get out of it but he doesn&rsquo;t really know who is he is actually. And I found this strong, after that, the message that mika was passing saying it was out people who were helping the cause,and i found that strong. And I thought it was a nice political message but passed really smoothly, it was nice.</p><p>O : That&rsquo;s true that, I was wondering, while you&rsquo;re filming, do you tell yourself &ldquo;there are people watching, maybe it&rsquo;s gonna change things&rdquo;</p><p>Max : No</p><p>A : No, frankly not at all</p><p>Max : Well I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s working what way, but, I know how Axel works at least, and  we have pretty much the same way of working that is to say, we&rsquo;re our characters from 8am to 8pm if we&rsquo;re filming, if we&rsquo;re filming until 5am we&rsquo;re our characters until 5am, and actually we don&rsquo;t think about the message, and it&rsquo;s a bit- when you act a scene you have to think about yourself, and what your character lives at the moment, you should not think about the impact you could have cause it&rsquo;s getting you out of your role, it brings you back to you&hellip; To me Maxence, for example, or to Assa or&hellip; Except we&rsquo;re not ourselves on set. So you really shouldn&rsquo;t think about the result, basically. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>J : Anyways that&rsquo;s more of David&rsquo;s job. He makes you act something, but because he has an idea in his directing about where he wants things to go.</p><p>Max :Yeah but you don&rsquo;t think about a message. Well. The message, you see it when you read your script, first reading, you tell yourself &ldquo;oh that&rsquo;s cool, bam bam bam&rdquo;</p><p>A : And especially when you discover. When I discover the episodes I tell myself &ldquo;oh yeah I understand David better now! He wanted to do that&rdquo; because on set, we act and we don&rsquo;t think about after, we don&rsquo;t think about how the scene is gonna be perceived by the audience, we&rsquo;re really in our characters and&hellip;</p><p>O : He doesn&rsquo;t brief you at all on this?</p><p>Max : No because it&rsquo;s not important</p><p>A : Yeah it&rsquo;s not useful. He just briefes us about how we have to act. How we have to feel things and how we have to act, it&rsquo;s really not&hellip;</p><p>Max : Because if we act bad, the messages won&rsquo;t be passed. If we fail our scenes, if we&rsquo;re not true in what we say during our scenes, the messages won&rsquo;t pass. Actually, the messages are a bit the result of all of the processus we put in place to create our character and-</p><p>A : Exactly</p><p>Max : Yeah. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s magical in being an actor. It&rsquo;s that, you see, you&rsquo;re alone in your room working on your scripts, working on your stuff, on set you&rsquo;re focused you&rsquo;re not thinking about anything else, and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s out and you see the impact</p><p>A : Really, it&rsquo;s exactly that</p><p>Max :And it&rsquo;s really the most beautiful gift of our job</p><p>A : Yeah</p><p>O : We&rsquo;re moving on to the debate</p><p>J : Yeah, we&rsquo;re going to do a debate</p><p>Max : And we don&rsquo;t talk about season 4?</p><p>J : Yes we do!</p><p>O : right after</p><p>Max : It&rsquo;s my favorite [?]</p><p>J : right after. There&rsquo;s a debate about s3 then debate about s4, and they&rsquo;re really important debates.</p><p>Max : okay</p><p>J : Ie, a debate about Eliott actually, are we for or against- Are Eliott&rsquo;s flirting techniques that good? (bitch&hellip;&hellip;. yes) What do you think about it?</p><p><i>okay I&rsquo;ll stop there for now and i&rsquo;m continuing the other half right away on another post, sorry this is taking so much time </i></p></p>",
