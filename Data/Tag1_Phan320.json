His heart is tap-tap-tapping fast in his chest, the queasy beat of anxiety he can&rsquo;t shake in situations like this. His whole life so far has been about pushing past and working around this feeling, trying not to let it defeat him. It&rsquo;s the voice in the back of his mind and the sweat underneath his collar and the butterflies in his stomach. He&rsquo;s wondering if maybe this is the wrong office after all, or maybe it&rsquo;s the right office but his new partner isn&rsquo;t around, or maybe he-</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi! You must be Dan!&rdquo; A person pops out from behind a closed doorway. He&rsquo;s wearing a suit but there&rsquo;s a stain on his tie and one leg of his pants are rucked up enough that Dan can see a bright green sock, definitely not bureau standard. &ldquo;Howell, I mean. Dan Howell?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan says, holding out a hand. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re Lester?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Call me Phil,&rdquo; his new partner says, and closes Dan&rsquo;s fingers in the grip of his own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>Phil Lester is also British. </p><p>Dan had known that going in. He&rsquo;d read Lester&rsquo;s - Phil&rsquo;s - file and then done what any millennial worth his salt does, and googled the fuck out of him. He knows where he&rsquo;s from and that he&rsquo;s got dual citizenship and that he likes leaving sometimes scathing hotel reviews. </p><p>He knows that Phil&rsquo;s last partner requested a transfer away from him, but the part of the file that listed why had been redacted. He&rsquo;s intensely curious; was being stuck with someone fresh out of Quantico a punishment for Phil? </p><p>Or was it a test for Dan? </p><p>If it was, he&rsquo;s not really sure what it&rsquo;s mean to accomplish because he&rsquo;s known Phil Lester for all of a day and all he has to show for it is a full belly - Phil values his lunch break and also values company while he takes it - and a growing sense of admiration for a man who seems to have been given the total shit end of the stick in terms of bureau assignments and still seems happy as a fucking clam about it. </p><p>* </p><p>It only takes two days for reality to settle in, consequently the same amount of time it takes for them to be given their first assignment as partners. </p><p>&ldquo;We got a case!&rdquo; Phil seems elated. &ldquo;And I think this one got sent down to us especially for you?&rdquo; </p><p>He slides Dan a folder. Dan picks it up and flips through it. &ldquo;Phishing? We&rsquo;re investigating&hellip; an email fraud scam?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Phil still looks far too delighted. Dan doesn&rsquo;t get it. &ldquo;Pacific Northwest. Oregon, I think?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan mutters a confirmation, still skimming the file. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Shouldn&rsquo;t this be easy to shut down? This looks like your average Nigerian prince bullshit.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil shakes his head. &ldquo;Keep reading.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan can feel his own brow wrinkling in confusing the more he gets into the file. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He mutters, then a few seconds later more loudly, &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Phil grins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, not if you&rsquo;re one of the people getting ripped off, but&hellip; how are they doing this?&rdquo; Dan flips back to the start to see if he missed anything. &ldquo;How did manage to phish seventeen high ranking cyber crimes assigned agents?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re supposed to figure out.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;So why us?&rdquo; Dan asks, clipping the buckle of the airplane seatbelt together. </p><p>They&rsquo;re in economy. He&rsquo;s not sure why he&rsquo;s disappointed. When Phil said they were flying out that evening he&rsquo;d pictured in his head some kind of Mission Impossible scene where they donned full suits and strode into business class wearing their sunglasses. </p><p>Instead Phil&rsquo;s in jeans and a hoodie and Dan feels overdressed in the button up and the same trousers he wore to the office. </p><p>&ldquo;Because we won&rsquo;t be targets,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had any cyber crimes cases, and you&rsquo;re brand new so no one&rsquo;s going to have heard of you. The last three agents they put on the case of this guy all had their security breached before they checked into the motel in Oregon. They think we&rsquo;ll be able to go undetected. We&rsquo;re not technically undercover. We&rsquo;re just - not&hellip; overcover? Either? So&hellip; you might want to dress a bit less&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Phil seems to flounder for a word. </p><p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Dan says, face going hot as he feels every bit of his comparative youth and inexperience. &ldquo;I brought some stuff.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t actually bring some stuff. </p><p>He sits on the edge of his motel bed, staring at a stain on the carpet. </p><p>(&ldquo;Not much of a budget of us, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Phil had said, standing in the lobby area. It&rsquo;s an open plan, two long flat buildings parallel with doors all facing open air. </p><p>Everything about it feels seedy and cheap. It&rsquo;s not even properly in town, it&rsquo;s on the fringes where things begin to look a bit worn down.) </p><p>He&rsquo;s not sure what the protocol is now. Phil said goodbye to him in the car park, but - what happens next? </p><p>It&rsquo;s only half six. Does he get dinner on his own? </p><p>Does he meet back up with Phil tomorrow? </p><p>Is he meant to be doing something with the case file? </p><p>Why hadn&rsquo;t he fucking asked? </p><p>He has the strange urge to ring his mum just to hear a familiar voice, but he refuses to be the person who needs his mum to tell him that it&rsquo;s alright on his first week of being an actual employed theoretically functional career adult. </p><p>He could go get some clothes so he doesn&rsquo;t look like an idiot when he and Phil meet back up. He&rsquo;s got the keys to the rental car - which Phil, for some reason, put entire trust and faith in Dan to drive even though Dan&rsquo;s only six months past being old enough to legally hire a car to begin with. But what if Phil looks outside and sees the car gone? Should he just take an Uber instead, or call for a taxi? But then what if Phil came to his room and Dan wasn&rsquo;t there but the car was? What if Phil saw him being picked up, or dropped back off? What if-</p><p>He stands and starts to pace around the room. His heart is hammering too fast and he&rsquo;s got that queasy-sweaty feeling that he gets when everything starts to become just a bit too much. </p><p>He jumps at the knock on his door. When he opens it, Phil&rsquo;s standing there - still in the same soft looking hoodie with his hair pushed back off his forehead and glasses on, and fuzzy pajama pants from the waist down. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it but we forgot to exchange mobile numbers. Also, do you fancy a pizza?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; Dan asks.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s smile falters a bit. &ldquo;Unless you just wanted to do dinner on your own. I just thought-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, pizza&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan quickly says. &ldquo;We could&hellip; talk about the case, too?&rdquo; </p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t on the plane, of course. Sensitive, classified material. </p><p>Dan assumes. </p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Phil says, shooting Dan one of those bright smiles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>Dan changes into his own pajamas quickly before Phil comes back. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t be sure, having never actually had a partner before, but he&rsquo;s fairly sure pajama pizza parties aren&rsquo;t standard operating protocol on assignments. </p><p>But then Phil is sat cross-legged on the full sized bed chewing on what appears to be half a slice of pizza he just shoved into his mouth in one bite. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he says, looking sheepish when he sees Dan staring. &ldquo;I was really hungry, and this pizza&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; </p><p>It is good, actually, and if Dan can just relax for five goddamn seconds he might enjoy it. Instead his body feels full of jittery energy still. He folds one foot underneath him while the other rests on the floor, foot tap-tap-tapping away. </p><p>Phil pulls out the case files after a few minutes. There&rsquo;s not that much to talk about; they&rsquo;re here to monitor the situation and close in on the suspect once the bureau can get a lock on him. </p><p>&ldquo;They wanted you,&rdquo; Phil says again, sounding almost proud. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s not sure why that makes him feel so nice. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your computer background,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;You specialized in profiling hackers, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I specialized in whatever meant I got to spend most of my time alone,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit of unintentional honesty, but it makes Phil laugh so he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad. </p><p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Dan asks, taking a bold step forward into casual conversation territory. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your specialty?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Linguistics,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t do much with it. Translations sometimes, but I&rsquo;m sort of&hellip; I get the cases no one else wants.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; Dan asks, settling back against the headboard. </p><p>&ldquo;I had to investigate a comedian last year,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Because someone reported one of his stand up bits. I had to track him for six months.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Was he funny?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>Phil shakes his head. &ldquo;Dead boring. All his jobs were about like, sleeping with women and disappointing his mum and sport.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not a fan of sport?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Or disappointing my mum,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;She gave birth to me, why would I want to call her stupid in front of people? Also she&rsquo;s not stupid. She probably heard me say that, using her mum senses. I wouldn&rsquo;t call you stupid, mum..&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she can hear you, but I believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>He thinks about the third thing Phil said the comedian talked about, and how Phil hadn&rsquo;t mentioned that at all. </p><p>But Phil&rsquo;s probably into women. Most guys are into women. Dan&rsquo;s really got to learn how to stop trying to project non-straightness on every man that talks to him for more than three seconds. </p><p>Especially his new partner at this job that, if all goes well, he&rsquo;ll be at for a very long time. </p><p>*</p><p>The rain starts around midnight. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s been gone for an hour, the pizza demolished and the case discussed and almost another hour of random conversation layered on top of and in between the two. </p><p>It was nice. Like - proper nice, in a way Dan hadn&rsquo;t expected. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s funny, and kind, and talking to him already makes Dan feel less scared. </p><p>The rain can fuck off, though. It&rsquo;s pounding against the windows, only drowned out every few minutes by massive cracks of thunder. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t take his eyes off the silhouette of trees across the way when the lightning strikes to accompany it. Framed by tall trees and threatening clouds, it looks like the setting of a horror movie out. </p><p>He hates storms at night. He won&rsquo;t sleep much, he already knows. He keeps the light turned on and his laptop up, distracting himself with music until he can&rsquo;t focus anymore and then watching youtube videos of fluffy animals. </p><p>It&rsquo;s fine - it&rsquo;s working. He&rsquo;ll be exhausted the next day, but he lives half his life deprived of adequate sleep. Adrenaline will save the day. It&rsquo;s fine, he&rsquo;s fine. </p><p>And then the power goes out. </p><p>*</p><p>He&rsquo;s shivering in front of Phil&rsquo;s hotel room, soaking wet from the dash across the half-full parking lot. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s going to say when Phil answers. </p><p>That he&rsquo;s a fucking child and he&rsquo;s afraid of the dark? </p><p>He should just pack his shit up right now, go back home and tell everyone he couldn&rsquo;t do it. None of them thought he&rsquo;d really be able to anyway. Even his nana, his biggest supporter and fan, made sure to tell him at least twice a year that failure&rsquo;s not the end. </p><p>They won&rsquo;t be surprised that he couldn&rsquo;t even hack it a week. </p><p>He feels sick and scared and ridiculous but self preservation kicks in two seconds after he knocks. His stomach lurches and he takes a step back, then another, and starts to walk away. He wishes there were a corner to turn, some way to hide. </p><p>Phil catches him before he gets too far. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>He sounds sleepy. Of course he was asleep. It&rsquo;s fucking one in the morning. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo; Dan turns around. &ldquo;The power&rsquo;s out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh - wow.&rdquo; Phil frowns and looks behind him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I slept through it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dan mumbles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just-&rdquo; </p><p>He waves a hand, but just as he starts to walk away again thunder crashes. It&rsquo;s chased by lightning only seconds later, shockingly close. </p><p>Dan shrieks and drops his phone. &ldquo;Fuck. Fuck!&rdquo; </p><p>Phil steps out into the rain and grabs Dan&rsquo;s phone for him. There&rsquo;s naked concern in his eyes. &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Dan stands dripping in front of Phil&rsquo;s door until Phil comes over with a towel. </p><p>What a fucking mess. He&rsquo;s a fucking mess. </p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Phil says, handing him a bundle of dry clothes. &ldquo;You can change in the toilet. I always bring extras, anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan slinks into the toilet. Every bit of him is drenched, hair and shirt and pants and socks. He leaves them in a soggy pile on Phil&rsquo;s floor, only keeping his pants on. He can live with that level of dampness. </p><p>When he steps back out, he&rsquo;s got apologies on his tongue but Phil speaks for he even has the chance. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful out there.&rdquo; Phil peers out the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably good you came over here. My phone&rsquo;s almost dead, I&rsquo;d only just plugged it in before I slept. Here&rsquo;s yours, by the way. You&rsquo;ve got a bit of a scratch in the corner but I tried to clean the mud off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. He&rsquo;d forgotten he&rsquo;d even dropped it. He takes it from Phil. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you-&rdquo; Phil starts to ask something, then stops. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>His face looks so, so kind. It&rsquo;s almost enough to break Dan. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Dan says, nodding more to himself than Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a lot.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Phil agrees. He sits down on the bed and pats the spot beside him. &ldquo;Come on, have a seat. Keep me company until the power comes back. </p><p>Phil wants Dan to keep him company. Phil, who surely can see the state that Dan is in, who can surely see how much Dan is struggling, is asking <i>Dan</i> to keep <i>him</i> company. </p><p>There&rsquo;s not much in the world that he&rsquo;s got any faith in, but in that moment he suddenly finds he has faith that Phil Lester is not going to make him feel as awful as most of the people he suffered through his Academy years with always did. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up with an ache in his neck from sleeping half propped up against the pillow. He&rsquo;s cold - body on top of the blankets of Phil&rsquo;s bed, still wearing Phil&rsquo;s pajamas. </p><p>He looks over. Phil&rsquo;s properly in bed, having apparently gotten under the bedding some time after Dan fell asleep. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t remember how many hours they stayed up talking, but by the time Dan&rsquo;s body did wear itself out the storm had faded off into a light patter of rain and the sun was threatening to come out. They didn&rsquo;t even talk about anything important - their respective childhoods in England, Quantico stories, Phil&rsquo;s seemingly endless recollections of strange and esoteric cases that have been given to him. The last thing he recalls if Phil grilling him on what his mum&rsquo;s dog Colin is like. </p><p>Apparently Phil really, really likes dogs. </p><p>Dan gives him one more look then gingerly gets out of bed and walks into the bathroom, collects his wet clothes, and retreats back to his own motel room. </p><p>*</p><p>He gets another three hours of sleep in his own bed before Phil&rsquo;s knocking wakes him up. </p><p>He&rsquo;s prepared for some kind of awkwardness, but instead Phil&rsquo;s fully dressed and smiling brightly. &quot;I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed our fantastic stay in Oregon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s confused. </p><p>Phil just shrugs. &ldquo;They got him. They want us back home today.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we didn&rsquo;t even have to do anything,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>Local police made the arrest, and higher ranking field agents descended to take him in. Now he and Phil are sat on a plane back to DC. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s full of restless energy, but in a different way than before in the motel room. Now he&rsquo;s just sort of disappointed that this was his first real case and the actual case part was&hellip; non-existent. All that hype and nothing to show for it. He wants a refund on the amount of emotional energy he&rsquo;s spent anticipating this. </p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;Sometimes assignments are just like that. It&rsquo;s not really like it is on television. Sometimes the agent who saves the day is behind a computer on the other side of the country. Is that&hellip; what you wanted, though? Excitement and like, guns and stuff?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Dan admits. &ldquo;The guns freak me out.&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s still wearing Phil&rsquo;s extra hoodie from the night before. It&rsquo;s cozy, and he firmly pushes away that faintly giddy feeling inside that comes with wearing the clothes of an attractive man that he is rapidly realizing he mind find himself liking quite a lot. </p><p>He also pushes away the memory of Phil asleep in bed beside him. He&rsquo;s probably straight, Dan thinks. He probably thinks Dan is straight too. He&rsquo;s only got room in his head for one crisis, and not being an embarrassment as a special agent has to take precedence right now. </p><p>Phil is giving him one of those pleasantly surprised looks. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also really bad at them. I&rsquo;m a horrible shot. My last partner - he requested off me. Thought I was, I believe the exact words were, a fucking weirdo who has no place in the bureau.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looks at Phil. He can see right away that Phil&rsquo;s struggling a bit with what he&rsquo;s saying. </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>Phil shrugs a bit, just a lift of one shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t try to be, but I suppose maybe I am. So if you want&hellip; if it doesn&rsquo;t end up&hellip; working out. It&rsquo;s alright. You do have options, they won&rsquo;t - they wouldn&rsquo;t question it, I think, if you wanted to transfer away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The pang of emotion Dan feels is as solid as a punch. He meets Phil&rsquo;s gaze directly and says, with almost a note of defiance in his voice, &ldquo;I think this is going to work out just fine.&rdquo;</p>",

His heart is tap-tap-tapping fast in his chest, the queasy beat of anxiety he can\u2019t shake in situations like this. His whole life so far has been about pushing past and working around this feeling, trying not to let it defeat him. It\u2019s the voice in the back of his mind and the sweat underneath his collar and the butterflies in his stomach. He\u2019s wondering if maybe this is the wrong office after all, or maybe it\u2019s the right office but his new partner isn\u2019t around, or maybe he-</p><p>\u201cOh, hi! You must be Dan!\u201d A person pops out from behind a closed doorway. He\u2019s wearing a suit but there\u2019s a stain on his tie and one leg of his pants are rucked up enough that Dan can see a bright green sock, definitely not bureau standard. \u201cHowell, I mean. Dan Howell?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan says, holding out a hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Lester?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCall me Phil,\u201d his new partner says, and closes Dan\u2019s fingers in the grip of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>Phil Lester is also British. </p><p>Dan had known that going in. He\u2019d read Lester\u2019s - Phil\u2019s - file and then done what any millennial worth his salt does, and googled the fuck out of him. He knows where he\u2019s from and that he\u2019s got dual citizenship and that he likes leaving sometimes scathing hotel reviews. </p><p>He knows that Phil\u2019s last partner requested a transfer away from him, but the part of the file that listed why had been redacted. He\u2019s intensely curious; was being stuck with someone fresh out of Quantico a punishment for Phil? </p><p>Or was it a test for Dan? </p><p>If it was, he\u2019s not really sure what it\u2019s mean to accomplish because he\u2019s known Phil Lester for all of a day and all he has to show for it is a full belly - Phil values his lunch break and also values company while he takes it - and a growing sense of admiration for a man who seems to have been given the total shit end of the stick in terms of bureau assignments and still seems happy as a fucking clam about it. </p><p>* </p><p>It only takes two days for reality to settle in, consequently the same amount of time it takes for them to be given their first assignment as partners. </p><p>\u201cWe got a case!\u201d Phil seems elated. \u201cAnd I think this one got sent down to us especially for you?\u201d </p><p>He slides Dan a folder. Dan picks it up and flips through it. \u201cPhishing? We\u2019re investigating\u2026 an email fraud scam?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Phil still looks far too delighted. Dan doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cPacific Northwest. Oregon, I think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan mutters a confirmation, still skimming the file. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Shouldn\u2019t this be easy to shut down? This looks like your average Nigerian prince bullshit.\u201d </p><p>Phil shakes his head. \u201cKeep reading.\u201d </p><p>Dan can feel his own brow wrinkling in confusing the more he gets into the file. \u201cWhat?\u201d He mutters, then a few seconds later more loudly, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Phil grins. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, not if you\u2019re one of the people getting ripped off, but\u2026 how are they doing this?\u201d Dan flips back to the start to see if he missed anything. \u201cHow did manage to phish seventeen high ranking cyber crimes assigned agents?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to figure out.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cSo why us?\u201d Dan asks, clipping the buckle of the airplane seatbelt together. </p><p>They\u2019re in economy. He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s disappointed. When Phil said they were flying out that evening he\u2019d pictured in his head some kind of Mission Impossible scene where they donned full suits and strode into business class wearing their sunglasses. </p><p>Instead Phil\u2019s in jeans and a hoodie and Dan feels overdressed in the button up and the same trousers he wore to the office. </p><p>\u201cBecause we won\u2019t be targets,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve not had any cyber crimes cases, and you\u2019re brand new so no one\u2019s going to have heard of you. The last three agents they put on the case of this guy all had their security breached before they checked into the motel in Oregon. They think we\u2019ll be able to go undetected. We\u2019re not technically undercover. We\u2019re just - not\u2026 overcover? Either? So\u2026 you might want to dress a bit less\u2026\u201d </p><p>Phil seems to flounder for a word. </p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dan says, face going hot as he feels every bit of his comparative youth and inexperience. \u201cI brought some stuff.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>He didn\u2019t actually bring some stuff. </p><p>He sits on the edge of his motel bed, staring at a stain on the carpet. </p><p>(\u201cNot much of a budget of us, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Phil had said, standing in the lobby area. It\u2019s an open plan, two long flat buildings parallel with doors all facing open air. </p><p>Everything about it feels seedy and cheap. It\u2019s not even properly in town, it\u2019s on the fringes where things begin to look a bit worn down.) </p><p>He\u2019s not sure what the protocol is now. Phil said goodbye to him in the car park, but - what happens next? </p><p>It\u2019s only half six. Does he get dinner on his own? </p><p>Does he meet back up with Phil tomorrow? </p><p>Is he meant to be doing something with the case file? </p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he fucking asked? </p><p>He has the strange urge to ring his mum just to hear a familiar voice, but he refuses to be the person who needs his mum to tell him that it\u2019s alright on his first week of being an actual employed theoretically functional career adult. </p><p>He could go get some clothes so he doesn\u2019t look like an idiot when he and Phil meet back up. He\u2019s got the keys to the rental car - which Phil, for some reason, put entire trust and faith in Dan to drive even though Dan\u2019s only six months past being old enough to legally hire a car to begin with. But what if Phil looks outside and sees the car gone? Should he just take an Uber instead, or call for a taxi? But then what if Phil came to his room and Dan wasn\u2019t there but the car was? What if Phil saw him being picked up, or dropped back off? What if-</p><p>He stands and starts to pace around the room. His heart is hammering too fast and he\u2019s got that queasy-sweaty feeling that he gets when everything starts to become just a bit too much. </p><p>He jumps at the knock on his door. When he opens it, Phil\u2019s standing there - still in the same soft looking hoodie with his hair pushed back off his forehead and glasses on, and fuzzy pajama pants from the waist down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it but we forgot to exchange mobile numbers. Also, do you fancy a pizza?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil\u2019s smile falters a bit. \u201cUnless you just wanted to do dinner on your own. I just thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pizza\u2019s good,\u201d Dan quickly says. \u201cWe could\u2026 talk about the case, too?\u201d </p><p>They hadn\u2019t on the plane, of course. Sensitive, classified material. </p><p>Dan assumes. </p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Phil says, shooting Dan one of those bright smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>Dan changes into his own pajamas quickly before Phil comes back. </p><p>He can\u2019t be sure, having never actually had a partner before, but he\u2019s fairly sure pajama pizza parties aren\u2019t standard operating protocol on assignments. </p><p>But then Phil is sat cross-legged on the full sized bed chewing on what appears to be half a slice of pizza he just shoved into his mouth in one bite. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, looking sheepish when he sees Dan staring. \u201cI was really hungry, and this pizza\u2019s good.\u201d </p><p>It is good, actually, and if Dan can just relax for five goddamn seconds he might enjoy it. Instead his body feels full of jittery energy still. He folds one foot underneath him while the other rests on the floor, foot tap-tap-tapping away. </p><p>Phil pulls out the case files after a few minutes. There\u2019s not that much to talk about; they\u2019re here to monitor the situation and close in on the suspect once the bureau can get a lock on him. </p><p>\u201cThey wanted you,\u201d Phil says again, sounding almost proud. </p><p>Dan\u2019s not sure why that makes him feel so nice. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour computer background,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou specialized in profiling hackers, didn\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI specialized in whatever meant I got to spend most of my time alone,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>It\u2019s a bit of unintentional honesty, but it makes Phil laugh so he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Dan asks, taking a bold step forward into casual conversation territory. \u201cWhat\u2019s your specialty?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLinguistics,\u201d Phil says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t do much with it. Translations sometimes, but I\u2019m sort of\u2026 I get the cases no one else wants.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Dan asks, settling back against the headboard. </p><p>\u201cI had to investigate a comedian last year,\u201d Phil says. \u201cBecause someone reported one of his stand up bits. I had to track him for six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas he funny?\u201d Dan asks. </p><p>Phil shakes his head. \u201cDead boring. All his jobs were about like, sleeping with women and disappointing his mum and sport.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a fan of sport?\u201d Dan asks. </p><p>\u201cOr disappointing my mum,\u201d Phil says. \u201cShe gave birth to me, why would I want to call her stupid in front of people? Also she\u2019s not stupid. She probably heard me say that, using her mum senses. I wouldn\u2019t call you stupid, mum..\u201d </p><p>Dan laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can hear you, but I believe you.\u201d</p><p>He thinks about the third thing Phil said the comedian talked about, and how Phil hadn\u2019t mentioned that at all. </p><p>But Phil\u2019s probably into women. Most guys are into women. Dan\u2019s really got to learn how to stop trying to project non-straightness on every man that talks to him for more than three seconds. </p><p>Especially his new partner at this job that, if all goes well, he\u2019ll be at for a very long time. </p><p>*</p><p>The rain starts around midnight. </p><p>Phil\u2019s been gone for an hour, the pizza demolished and the case discussed and almost another hour of random conversation layered on top of and in between the two. </p><p>It was nice. Like - proper nice, in a way Dan hadn\u2019t expected. </p><p>Phil\u2019s funny, and kind, and talking to him already makes Dan feel less scared. </p><p>The rain can fuck off, though. It\u2019s pounding against the windows, only drowned out every few minutes by massive cracks of thunder. </p><p>He can\u2019t take his eyes off the silhouette of trees across the way when the lightning strikes to accompany it. Framed by tall trees and threatening clouds, it looks like the setting of a horror movie out. </p><p>He hates storms at night. He won\u2019t sleep much, he already knows. He keeps the light turned on and his laptop up, distracting himself with music until he can\u2019t focus anymore and then watching youtube videos of fluffy animals. </p><p>It\u2019s fine - it\u2019s working. He\u2019ll be exhausted the next day, but he lives half his life deprived of adequate sleep. Adrenaline will save the day. It\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine. </p><p>And then the power goes out. </p><p>*</p><p>He\u2019s shivering in front of Phil\u2019s hotel room, soaking wet from the dash across the half-full parking lot. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s going to say when Phil answers. </p><p>That he\u2019s a fucking child and he\u2019s afraid of the dark? </p><p>He should just pack his shit up right now, go back home and tell everyone he couldn\u2019t do it. None of them thought he\u2019d really be able to anyway. Even his nana, his biggest supporter and fan, made sure to tell him at least twice a year that failure\u2019s not the end. </p><p>They won\u2019t be surprised that he couldn\u2019t even hack it a week. </p><p>He feels sick and scared and ridiculous but self preservation kicks in two seconds after he knocks. His stomach lurches and he takes a step back, then another, and starts to walk away. He wishes there were a corner to turn, some way to hide. </p><p>Phil catches him before he gets too far. \u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He sounds sleepy. Of course he was asleep. It\u2019s fucking one in the morning. </p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Dan turns around. \u201cThe power\u2019s out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh - wow.\u201d Phil frowns and looks behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I slept through it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan mumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll just-\u201d </p><p>He waves a hand, but just as he starts to walk away again thunder crashes. It\u2019s chased by lightning only seconds later, shockingly close. </p><p>Dan shrieks and drops his phone. \u201cFuck. Fuck!\u201d </p><p>Phil steps out into the rain and grabs Dan\u2019s phone for him. There\u2019s naked concern in his eyes. \u201cCome inside.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan stands dripping in front of Phil\u2019s door until Phil comes over with a towel. </p><p>What a fucking mess. He\u2019s a fucking mess. </p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Phil says, handing him a bundle of dry clothes. \u201cYou can change in the toilet. I always bring extras, anyway.\u201d </p><p>Dan slinks into the toilet. Every bit of him is drenched, hair and shirt and pants and socks. He leaves them in a soggy pile on Phil\u2019s floor, only keeping his pants on. He can live with that level of dampness. </p><p>When he steps back out, he\u2019s got apologies on his tongue but Phil speaks for he even has the chance. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful out there.\u201d Phil peers out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s probably good you came over here. My phone\u2019s almost dead, I\u2019d only just plugged it in before I slept. Here\u2019s yours, by the way. You\u2019ve got a bit of a scratch in the corner but I tried to clean the mud off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. He\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d even dropped it. He takes it from Phil. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you-\u201d Phil starts to ask something, then stops. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>His face looks so, so kind. It\u2019s almost enough to break Dan. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Dan says, nodding more to himself than Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Phil agrees. He sits down on the bed and pats the spot beside him. \u201cCome on, have a seat. Keep me company until the power comes back. </p><p>Phil wants Dan to keep him company. Phil, who surely can see the state that Dan is in, who can surely see how much Dan is struggling, is asking <i>Dan</i> to keep <i>him</i> company. </p><p>There\u2019s not much in the world that he\u2019s got any faith in, but in that moment he suddenly finds he has faith that Phil Lester is not going to make him feel as awful as most of the people he suffered through his Academy years with always did. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up with an ache in his neck from sleeping half propped up against the pillow. He\u2019s cold - body on top of the blankets of Phil\u2019s bed, still wearing Phil\u2019s pajamas. </p><p>He looks over. Phil\u2019s properly in bed, having apparently gotten under the bedding some time after Dan fell asleep. </p><p>He can\u2019t remember how many hours they stayed up talking, but by the time Dan\u2019s body did wear itself out the storm had faded off into a light patter of rain and the sun was threatening to come out. They didn\u2019t even talk about anything important - their respective childhoods in England, Quantico stories, Phil\u2019s seemingly endless recollections of strange and esoteric cases that have been given to him. The last thing he recalls if Phil grilling him on what his mum\u2019s dog Colin is like. </p><p>Apparently Phil really, really likes dogs. </p><p>Dan gives him one more look then gingerly gets out of bed and walks into the bathroom, collects his wet clothes, and retreats back to his own motel room. </p><p>*</p><p>He gets another three hours of sleep in his own bed before Phil\u2019s knocking wakes him up. </p><p>He\u2019s prepared for some kind of awkwardness, but instead Phil\u2019s fully dressed and smiling brightly. \"I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed our fantastic stay in Oregon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan\u2019s confused. </p><p>Phil just shrugs. \u201cThey got him. They want us back home today.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t even have to do anything,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>Local police made the arrest, and higher ranking field agents descended to take him in. Now he and Phil are sat on a plane back to DC. </p><p>Dan\u2019s full of restless energy, but in a different way than before in the motel room. Now he\u2019s just sort of disappointed that this was his first real case and the actual case part was\u2026 non-existent. All that hype and nothing to show for it. He wants a refund on the amount of emotional energy he\u2019s spent anticipating this. </p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cSometimes assignments are just like that. It\u2019s not really like it is on television. Sometimes the agent who saves the day is behind a computer on the other side of the country. Is that\u2026 what you wanted, though? Excitement and like, guns and stuff?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Dan admits. \u201cThe guns freak me out.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s still wearing Phil\u2019s extra hoodie from the night before. It\u2019s cozy, and he firmly pushes away that faintly giddy feeling inside that comes with wearing the clothes of an attractive man that he is rapidly realizing he mind find himself liking quite a lot. </p><p>He also pushes away the memory of Phil asleep in bed beside him. He\u2019s probably straight, Dan thinks. He probably thinks Dan is straight too. He\u2019s only got room in his head for one crisis, and not being an embarrassment as a special agent has to take precedence right now. </p><p>Phil is giving him one of those pleasantly surprised looks. \u201cMe too,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m also really bad at them. I\u2019m a horrible shot. My last partner - he requested off me. Thought I was, I believe the exact words were, a fucking weirdo who has no place in the bureau.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at Phil. He can see right away that Phil\u2019s struggling a bit with what he\u2019s saying. </p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>Phil shrugs a bit, just a lift of one shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t try to be, but I suppose maybe I am. So if you want\u2026 if it doesn\u2019t end up\u2026 working out. It\u2019s alright. You do have options, they won\u2019t - they wouldn\u2019t question it, I think, if you wanted to transfer away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The pang of emotion Dan feels is as solid as a punch. He meets Phil\u2019s gaze directly and says, with almost a note of defiance in his voice, \u201cI think this is going to work out just fine.\u201d</p>",

(A prequel to <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14733611\">Celebration</a>.)<br><b>Notes: </b>Written for <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwlGQiVnxlbHUuwmafDHkrw\">@waveydnp</a> for my thirty minute fics for charity fundraiser to benefit PhandomGives.\u00a0</p><p>[<b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15663249\">read on ao3</a></b>]</p><p>The basement office smells of stale air and weirdly sweet, like the smell of Dan\u2019s grandmother\u2019s car when he\u2019d leave a bag of sweets open in the summertime and they\u2019d all melt together into a sticky sugar lump. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHello?\u201d Dan calls out. His heart is tap-tap-tapping fast in his chest, the queasy beat of anxiety he can\u2019t shake in situations like this. His whole life so far has been about pushing past and working around this feeling, trying not to let it defeat him. It\u2019s the voice in the back of his mind and the sweat underneath his collar and the butterflies in his stomach. He\u2019s wondering if maybe this is the wrong office after all, or maybe it\u2019s the right office but his new partner isn\u2019t around, or maybe he-</p><p>\u201cOh, hi! You must be Dan!\u201d A person pops out from behind a closed doorway. He\u2019s wearing a suit but there\u2019s a stain on his tie and one leg of his pants are rucked up enough that Dan can see a bright green sock, definitely not bureau standard. \u201cHowell, I mean. Dan Howell?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan says, holding out a hand. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Lester?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCall me Phil,\u201d his new partner says, and closes Dan\u2019s fingers in the grip of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>Phil Lester is also British. </p><p>Dan had known that going in. He\u2019d read Lester\u2019s - Phil\u2019s - file and then done what any millennial worth his salt does, and googled the fuck out of him. He knows where he\u2019s from and that he\u2019s got dual citizenship and that he likes leaving sometimes scathing hotel reviews. </p><p>He knows that Phil\u2019s last partner requested a transfer away from him, but the part of the file that listed why had been redacted. He\u2019s intensely curious; was being stuck with someone fresh out of Quantico a punishment for Phil? </p><p>Or was it a test for Dan? </p><p>If it was, he\u2019s not really sure what it\u2019s mean to accomplish because he\u2019s known Phil Lester for all of a day and all he has to show for it is a full belly - Phil values his lunch break and also values company while he takes it - and a growing sense of admiration for a man who seems to have been given the total shit end of the stick in terms of bureau assignments and still seems happy as a fucking clam about it. </p><p>* </p><p>It only takes two days for reality to settle in, consequently the same amount of time it takes for them to be given their first assignment as partners. </p><p>\u201cWe got a case!\u201d Phil seems elated. \u201cAnd I think this one got sent down to us especially for you?\u201d </p><p>He slides Dan a folder. Dan picks it up and flips through it. \u201cPhishing? We\u2019re investigating\u2026 an email fraud scam?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Phil still looks far too delighted. Dan doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cPacific Northwest. Oregon, I think?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dan mutters a confirmation, still skimming the file. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Shouldn\u2019t this be easy to shut down? This looks like your average Nigerian prince bullshit.\u201d </p><p>Phil shakes his head. \u201cKeep reading.\u201d </p><p>Dan can feel his own brow wrinkling in confusing the more he gets into the file. \u201cWhat?\u201d He mutters, then a few seconds later more loudly, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Phil grins. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI mean, not if you\u2019re one of the people getting ripped off, but\u2026 how are they doing this?\u201d Dan flips back to the start to see if he missed anything. \u201cHow did manage to phish seventeen high ranking cyber crimes assigned agents?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to figure out.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>\u201cSo why us?\u201d Dan asks, clipping the buckle of the airplane seatbelt together. </p><p>They\u2019re in economy. He\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s disappointed. When Phil said they were flying out that evening he\u2019d pictured in his head some kind of Mission Impossible scene where they donned full suits and strode into business class wearing their sunglasses. </p><p>Instead Phil\u2019s in jeans and a hoodie and Dan feels overdressed in the button up and the same trousers he wore to the office. </p><p>\u201cBecause we won\u2019t be targets,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI\u2019ve not had any cyber crimes cases, and you\u2019re brand new so no one\u2019s going to have heard of you. The last three agents they put on the case of this guy all had their security breached before they checked into the motel in Oregon. They think we\u2019ll be able to go undetected. We\u2019re not technically undercover. We\u2019re just - not\u2026 overcover? Either? So\u2026 you might want to dress a bit less\u2026\u201d </p><p>Phil seems to flounder for a word. </p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Dan says, face going hot as he feels every bit of his comparative youth and inexperience. \u201cI brought some stuff.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>He didn\u2019t actually bring some stuff. </p><p>He sits on the edge of his motel bed, staring at a stain on the carpet. </p><p>(\u201cNot much of a budget of us, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Phil had said, standing in the lobby area. It\u2019s an open plan, two long flat buildings parallel with doors all facing open air. </p><p>Everything about it feels seedy and cheap. It\u2019s not even properly in town, it\u2019s on the fringes where things begin to look a bit worn down.) </p><p>He\u2019s not sure what the protocol is now. Phil said goodbye to him in the car park, but - what happens next? </p><p>It\u2019s only half six. Does he get dinner on his own? </p><p>Does he meet back up with Phil tomorrow? </p><p>Is he meant to be doing something with the case file? </p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he fucking asked? </p><p>He has the strange urge to ring his mum just to hear a familiar voice, but he refuses to be the person who needs his mum to tell him that it\u2019s alright on his first week of being an actual employed theoretically functional career adult. </p><p>He could go get some clothes so he doesn\u2019t look like an idiot when he and Phil meet back up. He\u2019s got the keys to the rental car - which Phil, for some reason, put entire trust and faith in Dan to drive even though Dan\u2019s only six months past being old enough to legally hire a car to begin with. But what if Phil looks outside and sees the car gone? Should he just take an Uber instead, or call for a taxi? But then what if Phil came to his room and Dan wasn\u2019t there but the car was? What if Phil saw him being picked up, or dropped back off? What if-</p><p>He stands and starts to pace around the room. His heart is hammering too fast and he\u2019s got that queasy-sweaty feeling that he gets when everything starts to become just a bit too much. </p><p>He jumps at the knock on his door. When he opens it, Phil\u2019s standing there - still in the same soft looking hoodie with his hair pushed back off his forehead and glasses on, and fuzzy pajama pants from the waist down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it but we forgot to exchange mobile numbers. Also, do you fancy a pizza?\u201d </p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Dan asks.</p><p>Phil\u2019s smile falters a bit. \u201cUnless you just wanted to do dinner on your own. I just thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pizza\u2019s good,\u201d Dan quickly says. \u201cWe could\u2026 talk about the case, too?\u201d </p><p>They hadn\u2019t on the plane, of course. Sensitive, classified material. </p><p>Dan assumes. </p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Phil says, shooting Dan one of those bright smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d </p><p>* </p><p>Dan changes into his own pajamas quickly before Phil comes back. </p><p>He can\u2019t be sure, having never actually had a partner before, but he\u2019s fairly sure pajama pizza parties aren\u2019t standard operating protocol on assignments. </p><p>But then Phil is sat cross-legged on the full sized bed chewing on what appears to be half a slice of pizza he just shoved into his mouth in one bite. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says, looking sheepish when he sees Dan staring. \u201cI was really hungry, and this pizza\u2019s good.\u201d </p><p>It is good, actually, and if Dan can just relax for five goddamn seconds he might enjoy it. Instead his body feels full of jittery energy still. He folds one foot underneath him while the other rests on the floor, foot tap-tap-tapping away. </p><p>Phil pulls out the case files after a few minutes. There\u2019s not that much to talk about; they\u2019re here to monitor the situation and close in on the suspect once the bureau can get a lock on him. </p><p>\u201cThey wanted you,\u201d Phil says again, sounding almost proud. </p><p>Dan\u2019s not sure why that makes him feel so nice. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYour computer background,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou specialized in profiling hackers, didn\u2019t you?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI specialized in whatever meant I got to spend most of my time alone,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>It\u2019s a bit of unintentional honesty, but it makes Phil laugh so he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad. </p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Dan asks, taking a bold step forward into casual conversation territory. \u201cWhat\u2019s your specialty?\u201d </p><p>\u201cLinguistics,\u201d Phil says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t do much with it. Translations sometimes, but I\u2019m sort of\u2026 I get the cases no one else wants.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Dan asks, settling back against the headboard. </p><p>\u201cI had to investigate a comedian last year,\u201d Phil says. \u201cBecause someone reported one of his stand up bits. I had to track him for six months.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWas he funny?\u201d Dan asks. </p><p>Phil shakes his head. \u201cDead boring. All his jobs were about like, sleeping with women and disappointing his mum and sport.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot a fan of sport?\u201d Dan asks. </p><p>\u201cOr disappointing my mum,\u201d Phil says. \u201cShe gave birth to me, why would I want to call her stupid in front of people? Also she\u2019s not stupid. She probably heard me say that, using her mum senses. I wouldn\u2019t call you stupid, mum..\u201d </p><p>Dan laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can hear you, but I believe you.\u201d</p><p>He thinks about the third thing Phil said the comedian talked about, and how Phil hadn\u2019t mentioned that at all. </p><p>But Phil\u2019s probably into women. Most guys are into women. Dan\u2019s really got to learn how to stop trying to project non-straightness on every man that talks to him for more than three seconds. </p><p>Especially his new partner at this job that, if all goes well, he\u2019ll be at for a very long time. </p><p>*</p><p>The rain starts around midnight. </p><p>Phil\u2019s been gone for an hour, the pizza demolished and the case discussed and almost another hour of random conversation layered on top of and in between the two. </p><p>It was nice. Like - proper nice, in a way Dan hadn\u2019t expected. </p><p>Phil\u2019s funny, and kind, and talking to him already makes Dan feel less scared. </p><p>The rain can fuck off, though. It\u2019s pounding against the windows, only drowned out every few minutes by massive cracks of thunder. </p><p>He can\u2019t take his eyes off the silhouette of trees across the way when the lightning strikes to accompany it. Framed by tall trees and threatening clouds, it looks like the setting of a horror movie out. </p><p>He hates storms at night. He won\u2019t sleep much, he already knows. He keeps the light turned on and his laptop up, distracting himself with music until he can\u2019t focus anymore and then watching youtube videos of fluffy animals. </p><p>It\u2019s fine - it\u2019s working. He\u2019ll be exhausted the next day, but he lives half his life deprived of adequate sleep. Adrenaline will save the day. It\u2019s fine, he\u2019s fine. </p><p>And then the power goes out. </p><p>*</p><p>He\u2019s shivering in front of Phil\u2019s hotel room, soaking wet from the dash across the half-full parking lot. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s going to say when Phil answers. </p><p>That he\u2019s a fucking child and he\u2019s afraid of the dark? </p><p>He should just pack his shit up right now, go back home and tell everyone he couldn\u2019t do it. None of them thought he\u2019d really be able to anyway. Even his nana, his biggest supporter and fan, made sure to tell him at least twice a year that failure\u2019s not the end. </p><p>They won\u2019t be surprised that he couldn\u2019t even hack it a week. </p><p>He feels sick and scared and ridiculous but self preservation kicks in two seconds after he knocks. His stomach lurches and he takes a step back, then another, and starts to walk away. He wishes there were a corner to turn, some way to hide. </p><p>Phil catches him before he gets too far. \u201cDan?\u201d </p><p>He sounds sleepy. Of course he was asleep. It\u2019s fucking one in the morning. </p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d Dan turns around. \u201cThe power\u2019s out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh - wow.\u201d Phil frowns and looks behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I slept through it.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dan mumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll just-\u201d </p><p>He waves a hand, but just as he starts to walk away again thunder crashes. It\u2019s chased by lightning only seconds later, shockingly close. </p><p>Dan shrieks and drops his phone. \u201cFuck. Fuck!\u201d </p><p>Phil steps out into the rain and grabs Dan\u2019s phone for him. There\u2019s naked concern in his eyes. \u201cCome inside.\u201d </p><p>*</p><p>Dan stands dripping in front of Phil\u2019s door until Phil comes over with a towel. </p><p>What a fucking mess. He\u2019s a fucking mess. </p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Phil says, handing him a bundle of dry clothes. \u201cYou can change in the toilet. I always bring extras, anyway.\u201d </p><p>Dan slinks into the toilet. Every bit of him is drenched, hair and shirt and pants and socks. He leaves them in a soggy pile on Phil\u2019s floor, only keeping his pants on. He can live with that level of dampness. </p><p>When he steps back out, he\u2019s got apologies on his tongue but Phil speaks for he even has the chance. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful out there.\u201d Phil peers out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s probably good you came over here. My phone\u2019s almost dead, I\u2019d only just plugged it in before I slept. Here\u2019s yours, by the way. You\u2019ve got a bit of a scratch in the corner but I tried to clean the mud off.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dan says. He\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d even dropped it. He takes it from Phil. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDid you-\u201d Phil starts to ask something, then stops. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>His face looks so, so kind. It\u2019s almost enough to break Dan. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Dan says, nodding more to himself than Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Phil agrees. He sits down on the bed and pats the spot beside him. \u201cCome on, have a seat. Keep me company until the power comes back. </p><p>Phil wants Dan to keep him company. Phil, who surely can see the state that Dan is in, who can surely see how much Dan is struggling, is asking <i>Dan</i> to keep <i>him</i> company. </p><p>There\u2019s not much in the world that he\u2019s got any faith in, but in that moment he suddenly finds he has faith that Phil Lester is not going to make him feel as awful as most of the people he suffered through his Academy years with always did. </p><p>*</p><p>Dan wakes up with an ache in his neck from sleeping half propped up against the pillow. He\u2019s cold - body on top of the blankets of Phil\u2019s bed, still wearing Phil\u2019s pajamas. </p><p>He looks over. Phil\u2019s properly in bed, having apparently gotten under the bedding some time after Dan fell asleep. </p><p>He can\u2019t remember how many hours they stayed up talking, but by the time Dan\u2019s body did wear itself out the storm had faded off into a light patter of rain and the sun was threatening to come out. They didn\u2019t even talk about anything important - their respective childhoods in England, Quantico stories, Phil\u2019s seemingly endless recollections of strange and esoteric cases that have been given to him. The last thing he recalls if Phil grilling him on what his mum\u2019s dog Colin is like. </p><p>Apparently Phil really, really likes dogs. </p><p>Dan gives him one more look then gingerly gets out of bed and walks into the bathroom, collects his wet clothes, and retreats back to his own motel room. </p><p>*</p><p>He gets another three hours of sleep in his own bed before Phil\u2019s knocking wakes him up. </p><p>He\u2019s prepared for some kind of awkwardness, but instead Phil\u2019s fully dressed and smiling brightly. \"I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed our fantastic stay in Oregon.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dan\u2019s confused. </p><p>Phil just shrugs. \u201cThey got him. They want us back home today.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t even have to do anything,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>Local police made the arrest, and higher ranking field agents descended to take him in. Now he and Phil are sat on a plane back to DC. </p><p>Dan\u2019s full of restless energy, but in a different way than before in the motel room. Now he\u2019s just sort of disappointed that this was his first real case and the actual case part was\u2026 non-existent. All that hype and nothing to show for it. He wants a refund on the amount of emotional energy he\u2019s spent anticipating this. </p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cSometimes assignments are just like that. It\u2019s not really like it is on television. Sometimes the agent who saves the day is behind a computer on the other side of the country. Is that\u2026 what you wanted, though? Excitement and like, guns and stuff?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Dan admits. \u201cThe guns freak me out.\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s still wearing Phil\u2019s extra hoodie from the night before. It\u2019s cozy, and he firmly pushes away that faintly giddy feeling inside that comes with wearing the clothes of an attractive man that he is rapidly realizing he mind find himself liking quite a lot. </p><p>He also pushes away the memory of Phil asleep in bed beside him. He\u2019s probably straight, Dan thinks. He probably thinks Dan is straight too. He\u2019s only got room in his head for one crisis, and not being an embarrassment as a special agent has to take precedence right now. </p><p>Phil is giving him one of those pleasantly surprised looks. \u201cMe too,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m also really bad at them. I\u2019m a horrible shot. My last partner - he requested off me. Thought I was, I believe the exact words were, a fucking weirdo who has no place in the bureau.\u201d </p><p>Dan looks at Phil. He can see right away that Phil\u2019s struggling a bit with what he\u2019s saying. </p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Dan says. </p><p>Phil shrugs a bit, just a lift of one shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t try to be, but I suppose maybe I am. So if you want\u2026 if it doesn\u2019t end up\u2026 working out. It\u2019s alright. You do have options, they won\u2019t - they wouldn\u2019t question it, I think, if you wanted to transfer away.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The pang of emotion Dan feels is as solid as a punch. He meets Phil\u2019s gaze directly and says, with almost a note of defiance in his voice, \u201cI think this is going to work out just fine.\u201d</p>",

(A prequel to <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14733611\">Celebration</a>.)<br /><b>Notes: </b>Written for <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwlGQiVnxlbHUuwmafDHkrw\">@waveydnp</a> for my thirty minute fics for charity fundraiser to benefit PhandomGives.&nbsp;</p><p>[<b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/15663249\">read on ao3</a></b>]</p><p>The basement office smells of stale air and weirdly sweet, like the smell of Dan&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s car when he&rsquo;d leave a bag of sweets open in the summertime and they&rsquo;d all melt together into a sticky sugar lump. </p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Dan calls out. His heart is tap-tap-tapping fast in his chest, the queasy beat of anxiety he can&rsquo;t shake in situations like this. His whole life so far has been about pushing past and working around this feeling, trying not to let it defeat him. It&rsquo;s the voice in the back of his mind and the sweat underneath his collar and the butterflies in his stomach. He&rsquo;s wondering if maybe this is the wrong office after all, or maybe it&rsquo;s the right office but his new partner isn&rsquo;t around, or maybe he-</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hi! You must be Dan!&rdquo; A person pops out from behind a closed doorway. He&rsquo;s wearing a suit but there&rsquo;s a stain on his tie and one leg of his pants are rucked up enough that Dan can see a bright green sock, definitely not bureau standard. &ldquo;Howell, I mean. Dan Howell?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan says, holding out a hand. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re Lester?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Call me Phil,&rdquo; his new partner says, and closes Dan&rsquo;s fingers in the grip of his own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to finally meet you.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>Phil Lester is also British. </p><p>Dan had known that going in. He&rsquo;d read Lester&rsquo;s - Phil&rsquo;s - file and then done what any millennial worth his salt does, and googled the fuck out of him. He knows where he&rsquo;s from and that he&rsquo;s got dual citizenship and that he likes leaving sometimes scathing hotel reviews. </p><p>He knows that Phil&rsquo;s last partner requested a transfer away from him, but the part of the file that listed why had been redacted. He&rsquo;s intensely curious; was being stuck with someone fresh out of Quantico a punishment for Phil? </p><p>Or was it a test for Dan? </p><p>If it was, he&rsquo;s not really sure what it&rsquo;s mean to accomplish because he&rsquo;s known Phil Lester for all of a day and all he has to show for it is a full belly - Phil values his lunch break and also values company while he takes it - and a growing sense of admiration for a man who seems to have been given the total shit end of the stick in terms of bureau assignments and still seems happy as a fucking clam about it. </p><p>* </p><p>It only takes two days for reality to settle in, consequently the same amount of time it takes for them to be given their first assignment as partners. </p><p>&ldquo;We got a case!&rdquo; Phil seems elated. &ldquo;And I think this one got sent down to us especially for you?&rdquo; </p><p>He slides Dan a folder. Dan picks it up and flips through it. &ldquo;Phishing? We&rsquo;re investigating&hellip; an email fraud scam?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Phil still looks far too delighted. Dan doesn&rsquo;t get it. &ldquo;Pacific Northwest. Oregon, I think?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan mutters a confirmation, still skimming the file. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. Shouldn&rsquo;t this be easy to shut down? This looks like your average Nigerian prince bullshit.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil shakes his head. &ldquo;Keep reading.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan can feel his own brow wrinkling in confusing the more he gets into the file. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He mutters, then a few seconds later more loudly, &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Phil grins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I mean, not if you&rsquo;re one of the people getting ripped off, but&hellip; how are they doing this?&rdquo; Dan flips back to the start to see if he missed anything. &ldquo;How did manage to phish seventeen high ranking cyber crimes assigned agents?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re supposed to figure out.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;So why us?&rdquo; Dan asks, clipping the buckle of the airplane seatbelt together. </p><p>They&rsquo;re in economy. He&rsquo;s not sure why he&rsquo;s disappointed. When Phil said they were flying out that evening he&rsquo;d pictured in his head some kind of Mission Impossible scene where they donned full suits and strode into business class wearing their sunglasses. </p><p>Instead Phil&rsquo;s in jeans and a hoodie and Dan feels overdressed in the button up and the same trousers he wore to the office. </p><p>&ldquo;Because we won&rsquo;t be targets,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had any cyber crimes cases, and you&rsquo;re brand new so no one&rsquo;s going to have heard of you. The last three agents they put on the case of this guy all had their security breached before they checked into the motel in Oregon. They think we&rsquo;ll be able to go undetected. We&rsquo;re not technically undercover. We&rsquo;re just - not&hellip; overcover? Either? So&hellip; you might want to dress a bit less&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>Phil seems to flounder for a word. </p><p>&ldquo;No worries,&rdquo; Dan says, face going hot as he feels every bit of his comparative youth and inexperience. &ldquo;I brought some stuff.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t actually bring some stuff. </p><p>He sits on the edge of his motel bed, staring at a stain on the carpet. </p><p>(&ldquo;Not much of a budget of us, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Phil had said, standing in the lobby area. It&rsquo;s an open plan, two long flat buildings parallel with doors all facing open air. </p><p>Everything about it feels seedy and cheap. It&rsquo;s not even properly in town, it&rsquo;s on the fringes where things begin to look a bit worn down.) </p><p>He&rsquo;s not sure what the protocol is now. Phil said goodbye to him in the car park, but - what happens next? </p><p>It&rsquo;s only half six. Does he get dinner on his own? </p><p>Does he meet back up with Phil tomorrow? </p><p>Is he meant to be doing something with the case file? </p><p>Why hadn&rsquo;t he fucking asked? </p><p>He has the strange urge to ring his mum just to hear a familiar voice, but he refuses to be the person who needs his mum to tell him that it&rsquo;s alright on his first week of being an actual employed theoretically functional career adult. </p><p>He could go get some clothes so he doesn&rsquo;t look like an idiot when he and Phil meet back up. He&rsquo;s got the keys to the rental car - which Phil, for some reason, put entire trust and faith in Dan to drive even though Dan&rsquo;s only six months past being old enough to legally hire a car to begin with. But what if Phil looks outside and sees the car gone? Should he just take an Uber instead, or call for a taxi? But then what if Phil came to his room and Dan wasn&rsquo;t there but the car was? What if Phil saw him being picked up, or dropped back off? What if-</p><p>He stands and starts to pace around the room. His heart is hammering too fast and he&rsquo;s got that queasy-sweaty feeling that he gets when everything starts to become just a bit too much. </p><p>He jumps at the knock on his door. When he opens it, Phil&rsquo;s standing there - still in the same soft looking hoodie with his hair pushed back off his forehead and glasses on, and fuzzy pajama pants from the waist down. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it but we forgot to exchange mobile numbers. Also, do you fancy a pizza?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pizza?&rdquo; Dan asks.</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s smile falters a bit. &ldquo;Unless you just wanted to do dinner on your own. I just thought-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, pizza&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan quickly says. &ldquo;We could&hellip; talk about the case, too?&rdquo; </p><p>They hadn&rsquo;t on the plane, of course. Sensitive, classified material. </p><p>Dan assumes. </p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Phil says, shooting Dan one of those bright smiles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo; </p><p>* </p><p>Dan changes into his own pajamas quickly before Phil comes back. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t be sure, having never actually had a partner before, but he&rsquo;s fairly sure pajama pizza parties aren&rsquo;t standard operating protocol on assignments. </p><p>But then Phil is sat cross-legged on the full sized bed chewing on what appears to be half a slice of pizza he just shoved into his mouth in one bite. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he says, looking sheepish when he sees Dan staring. &ldquo;I was really hungry, and this pizza&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; </p><p>It is good, actually, and if Dan can just relax for five goddamn seconds he might enjoy it. Instead his body feels full of jittery energy still. He folds one foot underneath him while the other rests on the floor, foot tap-tap-tapping away. </p><p>Phil pulls out the case files after a few minutes. There&rsquo;s not that much to talk about; they&rsquo;re here to monitor the situation and close in on the suspect once the bureau can get a lock on him. </p><p>&ldquo;They wanted you,&rdquo; Phil says again, sounding almost proud. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s not sure why that makes him feel so nice. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Your computer background,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;You specialized in profiling hackers, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I specialized in whatever meant I got to spend most of my time alone,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit of unintentional honesty, but it makes Phil laugh so he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad. </p><p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; Dan asks, taking a bold step forward into casual conversation territory. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your specialty?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Linguistics,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t do much with it. Translations sometimes, but I&rsquo;m sort of&hellip; I get the cases no one else wants.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; Dan asks, settling back against the headboard. </p><p>&ldquo;I had to investigate a comedian last year,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;Because someone reported one of his stand up bits. I had to track him for six months.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Was he funny?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>Phil shakes his head. &ldquo;Dead boring. All his jobs were about like, sleeping with women and disappointing his mum and sport.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not a fan of sport?&rdquo; Dan asks. </p><p>&ldquo;Or disappointing my mum,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;She gave birth to me, why would I want to call her stupid in front of people? Also she&rsquo;s not stupid. She probably heard me say that, using her mum senses. I wouldn&rsquo;t call you stupid, mum..&rdquo; </p><p>Dan laughs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she can hear you, but I believe you.&rdquo;</p><p>He thinks about the third thing Phil said the comedian talked about, and how Phil hadn&rsquo;t mentioned that at all. </p><p>But Phil&rsquo;s probably into women. Most guys are into women. Dan&rsquo;s really got to learn how to stop trying to project non-straightness on every man that talks to him for more than three seconds. </p><p>Especially his new partner at this job that, if all goes well, he&rsquo;ll be at for a very long time. </p><p>*</p><p>The rain starts around midnight. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s been gone for an hour, the pizza demolished and the case discussed and almost another hour of random conversation layered on top of and in between the two. </p><p>It was nice. Like - proper nice, in a way Dan hadn&rsquo;t expected. </p><p>Phil&rsquo;s funny, and kind, and talking to him already makes Dan feel less scared. </p><p>The rain can fuck off, though. It&rsquo;s pounding against the windows, only drowned out every few minutes by massive cracks of thunder. </p><p>He can&rsquo;t take his eyes off the silhouette of trees across the way when the lightning strikes to accompany it. Framed by tall trees and threatening clouds, it looks like the setting of a horror movie out. </p><p>He hates storms at night. He won&rsquo;t sleep much, he already knows. He keeps the light turned on and his laptop up, distracting himself with music until he can&rsquo;t focus anymore and then watching youtube videos of fluffy animals. </p><p>It&rsquo;s fine - it&rsquo;s working. He&rsquo;ll be exhausted the next day, but he lives half his life deprived of adequate sleep. Adrenaline will save the day. It&rsquo;s fine, he&rsquo;s fine. </p><p>And then the power goes out. </p><p>*</p><p>He&rsquo;s shivering in front of Phil&rsquo;s hotel room, soaking wet from the dash across the half-full parking lot. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t even know what he&rsquo;s going to say when Phil answers. </p><p>That he&rsquo;s a fucking child and he&rsquo;s afraid of the dark? </p><p>He should just pack his shit up right now, go back home and tell everyone he couldn&rsquo;t do it. None of them thought he&rsquo;d really be able to anyway. Even his nana, his biggest supporter and fan, made sure to tell him at least twice a year that failure&rsquo;s not the end. </p><p>They won&rsquo;t be surprised that he couldn&rsquo;t even hack it a week. </p><p>He feels sick and scared and ridiculous but self preservation kicks in two seconds after he knocks. His stomach lurches and he takes a step back, then another, and starts to walk away. He wishes there were a corner to turn, some way to hide. </p><p>Phil catches him before he gets too far. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo; </p><p>He sounds sleepy. Of course he was asleep. It&rsquo;s fucking one in the morning. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo; Dan turns around. &ldquo;The power&rsquo;s out.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh - wow.&rdquo; Phil frowns and looks behind him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I slept through it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Dan mumbles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just-&rdquo; </p><p>He waves a hand, but just as he starts to walk away again thunder crashes. It&rsquo;s chased by lightning only seconds later, shockingly close. </p><p>Dan shrieks and drops his phone. &ldquo;Fuck. Fuck!&rdquo; </p><p>Phil steps out into the rain and grabs Dan&rsquo;s phone for him. There&rsquo;s naked concern in his eyes. &ldquo;Come inside.&rdquo; </p><p>*</p><p>Dan stands dripping in front of Phil&rsquo;s door until Phil comes over with a towel. </p><p>What a fucking mess. He&rsquo;s a fucking mess. </p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Phil says, handing him a bundle of dry clothes. &ldquo;You can change in the toilet. I always bring extras, anyway.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan slinks into the toilet. Every bit of him is drenched, hair and shirt and pants and socks. He leaves them in a soggy pile on Phil&rsquo;s floor, only keeping his pants on. He can live with that level of dampness. </p><p>When he steps back out, he&rsquo;s got apologies on his tongue but Phil speaks for he even has the chance. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful out there.&rdquo; Phil peers out the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably good you came over here. My phone&rsquo;s almost dead, I&rsquo;d only just plugged it in before I slept. Here&rsquo;s yours, by the way. You&rsquo;ve got a bit of a scratch in the corner but I tried to clean the mud off.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan says. He&rsquo;d forgotten he&rsquo;d even dropped it. He takes it from Phil. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Did you-&rdquo; Phil starts to ask something, then stops. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>His face looks so, so kind. It&rsquo;s almost enough to break Dan. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Dan says, nodding more to himself than Phil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a lot.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Phil agrees.

The last thing he recalls if Phil grilling him on what his mum&rsquo;s dog Colin is like. </p><p>Apparently Phil really, really likes dogs. </p><p>Dan gives him one more look then gingerly gets out of bed and walks into the bathroom, collects his wet clothes, and retreats back to his own motel room. </p><p>*</p><p>He gets another three hours of sleep in his own bed before Phil&rsquo;s knocking wakes him up. </p><p>He&rsquo;s prepared for some kind of awkwardness, but instead Phil&rsquo;s fully dressed and smiling brightly. \"I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed our fantastic stay in Oregon.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s confused. </p><p>Phil just shrugs. &ldquo;They got him. They want us back home today.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we didn&rsquo;t even have to do anything,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>Local police made the arrest, and higher ranking field agents descended to take him in. Now he and Phil are sat on a plane back to DC. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s full of restless energy, but in a different way than before in the motel room. Now he&rsquo;s just sort of disappointed that this was his first real case and the actual case part was&hellip; non-existent. All that hype and nothing to show for it. He wants a refund on the amount of emotional energy he&rsquo;s spent anticipating this. </p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;Sometimes assignments are just like that. It&rsquo;s not really like it is on television. Sometimes the agent who saves the day is behind a computer on the other side of the country. Is that&hellip; what you wanted, though? Excitement and like, guns and stuff?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Dan admits. &ldquo;The guns freak me out.&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s still wearing Phil&rsquo;s extra hoodie from the night before. It&rsquo;s cozy, and he firmly pushes away that faintly giddy feeling inside that comes with wearing the clothes of an attractive man that he is rapidly realizing he mind find himself liking quite a lot. </p><p>He also pushes away the memory of Phil asleep in bed beside him. He&rsquo;s probably straight, Dan thinks. He probably thinks Dan is straight too. He&rsquo;s only got room in his head for one crisis, and not being an embarrassment as a special agent has to take precedence right now. </p><p>Phil is giving him one of those pleasantly surprised looks. &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also really bad at them. I&rsquo;m a horrible shot. My last partner - he requested off me. Thought I was, I believe the exact words were, a fucking weirdo who has no place in the bureau.&rdquo; </p><p>Dan looks at Phil. He can see right away that Phil&rsquo;s struggling a bit with what he&rsquo;s saying. </p><p>&ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Dan says. </p><p>Phil shrugs a bit, just a lift of one shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t try to be, but I suppose maybe I am. So if you want&hellip; if it doesn&rsquo;t end up&hellip; working out. It&rsquo;s alright. You do have options, they won&rsquo;t - they wouldn&rsquo;t question it, I think, if you wanted to transfer away.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The pang of emotion Dan feels is as solid as a punch. He meets Phil&rsquo;s gaze directly and says, with almost a note of defiance in his voice, &ldquo;I think this is going to work out just fine.&rdquo;</p>",
