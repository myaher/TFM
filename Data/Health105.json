Nutrition</i></p><p>You\u2019ll often hear people argue blue in the face whether calories matter to your goal at all. <i>Ahem.</i> They do. <b>THIS SHOULD NOT BE A CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENT.</b> I don\u2019t care what cult of nutrition you subscribe to, you are bound to the laws of physics. Take comfort in that! If you\u2019re trying to gain mass, you need a surplus. If you\u2019re trying to cut, you need a deficit. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to eat an actual refrigerator to get a surplus, and you don\u2019t need to subsist on only celery sticks to make a deficit. It turns out there\u2019s a happy medium. I know&ndash;simply unbelievable!</p><p>In a world that promotes only tortuous extremes the only \u201csecret\u201d is learning to simplify and moderate everything from your viewpoint to your approach. You don\u2019t need to starve to lose weight. You don\u2019t need to be uncomfortably full to put on weight. In fact, the more modest your approach the more success you\u2019ll have in sticking to it long term and reaching your goal.</p><p>So, then? <i>Where does nutrition come in?</i> <b>Sustainability and overall health.</b> While junk food is also bound to the laws of physics, consuming large amounts of it can stimulate appetite, depress your mood, and make you feel exhausted. Over a long period of time, the lack of actual fuel will lead to a crash and ravenous hunger that most will feed into. That\u2019s the reason many people claim that \u201cnot all calories are the same.\u201d In terms of <i>physics,</i> they are. In terms of <b>health and sustainability,</b> they are very different. A meal plan filled with vegetables, fruit, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and water is going to get you through the day feeling happy, full, and strong. However, if your portions are inaccurate, you will still struggle to get your desired results. Conversely, a meal plan of Hot Pockets, Oreos, Pepsi, and Fruit Loops can be within your goal calorie ranges but you will be left irritable, exhausted, and more susceptible to having a 3 AM taquito feast when you just cannot stand the hunger pangs anymore.</p><p>Calories and nutrition are something that works in concert, not against each other. The quality of your food and the quantity of your food both matter. Nutritious foods are more satiating; therefore, more sustainable. But, for everything that junk food does wrong to us, a cookie in the context of an otherwise great meal plan does not create black magic that puts a boot in your progress.</p><h2>A <strike>Quick</strike> Guide</h2><p><b>1. </b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftdeecalculator.net%2F&amp;t=MzE5OTcwOGViZThiY2NhODcwYmM2NzdiNzcyNmYwMDJhMTE4ZmRlNSw1NzA4MGNiYzFmYTQzNzIzZjQ1ZjMyZWY4OThlYWYyMzJhMDQyYzdk\"> Calculate your TDEE.</a> There is no magical number. Everyone comes in different heights, ages, genders, activity levels, and starting weights. All of these factor into your approximate metabolic rate. Use the calculator to find out your approximate energy requirements. If you have a medical condition that is known to affect metabolic rate, consult with your specialist and/or a registered dietician. It\u2019s trickier with these conditions, but not impossible. Additionally, if you have a chronic health condition or a severe dietary restriction, do the same. You may need to work with a health professional to construct a plan that will not leave you taking in too little or too much of a certain nutrient.</p><p>TDEE is not an exact science but most people will exist within a 100-200 calorie range of their estimate. You do not need to be dead on to move forward, just in the ballpark. Adjustments can be made as you go along. You might have to do some troubleshooting. Struggling to find your range is not a failure, it can sometimes be a genuinely annoying aspect of this process!</p><p><b>2. </b>Select your rate. <b>Sustainable and healthy weight change is slow and steady. </b>It will closely resemble the way you intend to maintain your results. The way you lose or gain weight is the way you\u2019ll maintain it, just adjusted for maintenance. Depending on your starting stats, sustainable weight loss is 1-2 lbs a week while sustainable weight gain is \u00bd lb-1 lb a week.</p><p>This translates to a 500-1000 calorie/day deficit from your TDEE or a 250-500 calorie surplus from your TDEE. When you have your TDEE calculated, subtract or add to find your target. If you are working with a dietician, discuss your goals and value their input.<b> If your weight loss or weight gain goal is modest, select the slower rate.</b> Selecting too strict a rate can result in malnourishment and other poor health implications.</p><p><b>3.</b> There is no ideal eating style. There are some general guidelines such as more plant foods and less sugar but most else you hear is a squabbling war of ideas. The best eating plan is the one that keeps you full and satisfied within your target and is affordable for you. For some people that\u2019s going to be low carb/ketogenic, for others it\u2019s going to be a high carb, low-fat diet. There are some medical conditions that can benefit from a particular eating style but that is to be discussed with a medical professional that treats that condition first and not a bunch of Internet randoms.</p><p><b>4.</b> Choose a way to monitor and retrain your eating habits. I\u2019m not going to take a strong stance for or against calorie/macro counting and measuring cups/digital scales. <i>That is up to you.</i> I had no frame of reference for what constituted a portion size, so I personally found it super helpful to use these tools. There are many free apps such as MyFitnessPal, Loseit, and CRON-O-Meter and measuring cups are very affordable and accessible. Even digital food scales won\u2019t set you back too much, and they make fewer dishes! <i>However, everyone experiences the world differently and has different challenges.</i> If you know that calorie counting causes you anxiety or triggers compulsions and poor eating habits, written journals or photo journals can also be used to make these observations. Others may find it preferable to practice what is called mindful eating. <b>Which, everyone should do;</b> of course, but many are successful with it as their primary strategy</p><p><b>5.</b> Exercise is very beneficial to your health and body composition, but your <b>eating habits take up the bulk of the work.</b> I still highly recommend starting a routine. It can be difficult depending on your current fitness level. If you\u2019re starting at an absolute square one, focus on activities that improve daily mobility such as walking, flexibility, and core strength. This can reduce the risk of injury if you have no prior experience and build the essential muscle groups needed for more advanced exercise. If you\u2019ve got some basic fitness skills, you can skip ahead to beginner cardio and weight bearing routines.</p><p><b>6. </b> Don\u2019t obsess. Don\u2019t overthink. Numbers are only tools. You are never \u201ccheating\u201d for eating, and a \u201cperfect\u201d day is not your benchmark for success. If an extra snack is what keeps you held over until dinner; thus, making better decisions&ndash;do it. If your leg feels jacked up, rest. You\u2019re a human, not a machine. There isn\u2019t a due date on a healthy lifestyle. <b>You are not a term paper.</b> Slowly, and surely you\u2019ll get there.</p><p><b>7. </b> Your life is not on hold and you need to release yourself of all toxic associations with food and activity. Enjoying a holiday feast or birthday treat is not worthy of guilt. Having a fun night out is not throwing in the towel. Sleeping in on a snowy day to cuddle with the cat is not sloth. It\u2019s a single day. A day where you choose to enjoy some of the more indulgent things in life. In moderation, they are perfectly fine for you.</p><p><b>8. </b> I recommend tracking your progress with more than one metric. Most people will rely on the feedback from the scale. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this but due to numerous NATUAL factors, your weight can fluctuate up/down or stagnate for a period of time. Exercise, certain foods, and hormones can cause significant water retention. We all get constipated or dehydrated time-to-time. Get the idea? If seeing these fluctuations or plateaus impacts your mood, weigh less frequently. Additionally, consider taking tape measurements about once a month. Remember, after a while, a physically active lifestyle combined with a healthy diet can cause changes to your body composition in ways a scale cannot tell you. You may still be losing or gaining inches!</p><p><b>9.</b>Your journey is mental. Understand this now and get a head up on it. Try journaling about both your positive and tumultuous experiences, break down those feelings, and try to understand them. Your journey is not going to be difficult due to a lack of knowledge. It\u2019s difficult because many of us have been unkind and unfair to ourselves. Stop berating yourself. Stop comparing yourself. Stop making prerequisites to loving yourself. Start an amazing relationship with yourself. <b>Today!</b></p><h2>A Quick List of Stuff That is Complete and Utter Bullshit</h2><p><i>You may have a read a thing or two about this stuff..</i>.</p><p><b>Alkalizing Diets&ndash; </b>Different parts of the body maintain a different pH and the body desires homeostasis. Even if you could change the pH of your body, you wouldn\u2019t want to and the body will find a way to return it to normal. It\u2019s designed that way. </p><p><b>Superfoods&ndash; </b>These are just foods that previously had no horticultural value or target market. Some of them were even once considered weeds or garnish. Then, someone made up a trendy product, attributed an absurd value to it, and then the copycats followed. Most of them are no more valuable than what you can already find in the grocery store. Many of these are delicious, but several are expensive and not very special. If you stick with what you\u2019re already familiar with, you\u2019re getting more than enough nutrition and saving your money. </p><p><b>Detoxing&ndash;</b> Just. Don\u2019t. Skinny teas, juice fasts, and most herbal supplements are pretty much just starvation diets or \u201ccleanse\u201d you by means of inducing diarrhea. Infused water is tasty but is mostly a way to waste perfectly good produce. Here\u2019s a novel idea. Eat the fruit. Your digestive and renal systems do all the detoxing your body needs. Eat fiber, eat a selection of fruits + vegetables, and drink water and your visceral organs will do the rest!</p><p><b>Metabolism Boosting Foods and \u201cBelly Fat Melting\u201d Foods&ndash;Y</b>our potion of green tea, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper isn\u2019t going to boost your metabolism or burn fat in any meaningful way. It will taste disgusting and take the enamel off your teeth. Don\u2019t overthink it. Eat fresh food, drink water, and get active. That\u2019s it. Drink tea if you like it but any effect it has won\u2019t outdo poor habits.\u00a0</p><p><b>Spot Reducing&ndash;</b> Doesn\u2019t exist. You can preserve or build muscle mass by performing an exercise, but no amount of that exercise will preferentially burn fat. Where we lose fat first depends mostly on genetics.</p>",

Take comfort in that! If you\u2019re trying to gain mass, you need a surplus. If you\u2019re trying to cut, you need a deficit. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to eat an actual refrigerator to get a surplus, and you don\u2019t need to subsist on only celery sticks to make a deficit. It turns out there\u2019s a happy medium. I know\u2013simply unbelievable!</p><p>In a world that promotes only tortuous extremes the only \u201csecret\u201d is learning to simplify and moderate everything from your viewpoint to your approach. You don\u2019t need to starve to lose weight. You don\u2019t need to be uncomfortably full to put on weight. In fact, the more modest your approach the more success you\u2019ll have in sticking to it long term and reaching your goal.</p><p>So, then? <i>Where does nutrition come in?</i> <b>Sustainability and overall health.</b> While junk food is also bound to the laws of physics, consuming large amounts of it can stimulate appetite, depress your mood, and make you feel exhausted. Over a long period of time, the lack of actual fuel will lead to a crash and ravenous hunger that most will feed into. That\u2019s the reason many people claim that \u201cnot all calories are the same.\u201d In terms of <i>physics,</i> they are. In terms of <b>health and sustainability,</b> they are very different. A meal plan filled with vegetables, fruit, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats, and water is going to get you through the day feeling happy, full, and strong. However, if your portions are inaccurate, you will still struggle to get your desired results. Conversely, a meal plan of Hot Pockets, Oreos, Pepsi, and Fruit Loops can be within your goal calorie ranges but you will be left irritable, exhausted, and more susceptible to having a 3 AM taquito feast when you just cannot stand the hunger pangs anymore.</p><p>Calories and nutrition are something that works in concert, not against each other. The quality of your food and the quantity of your food both matter. Nutritious foods are more satiating; therefore, more sustainable. But, for everything that junk food does wrong to us, a cookie in the context of an otherwise great meal plan does not create black magic that puts a boot in your progress.</p><h2>A <strike>Quick</strike> Guide</h2><p><b>1. </b><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftdeecalculator.net%2F&amp;t=MzE5OTcwOGViZThiY2NhODcwYmM2NzdiNzcyNmYwMDJhMTE4ZmRlNSw1NzA4MGNiYzFmYTQzNzIzZjQ1ZjMyZWY4OThlYWYyMzJhMDQyYzdk\"> Calculate your TDEE.</a> There is no magical number.

If you&rsquo;ve got some basic fitness skills, you can skip ahead to beginner cardio and weight bearing routines.</p><p><b>6. </b> Don&rsquo;t obsess. Don&rsquo;t overthink. Numbers are only tools. You are never &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; for eating, and a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; day is not your benchmark for success. If an extra snack is what keeps you held over until dinner; thus, making better decisions&ndash;do it. If your leg feels jacked up, rest. You&rsquo;re a human, not a machine. There isn&rsquo;t a due date on a healthy lifestyle. <b>You are not a term paper.</b> Slowly, and surely you&rsquo;ll get there.</p><p><b>7. </b> Your life is not on hold and you need to release yourself of all toxic associations with food and activity. Enjoying a holiday feast or birthday treat is not worthy of guilt. Having a fun night out is not throwing in the towel. Sleeping in on a snowy day to cuddle with the cat is not sloth. It&rsquo;s a single day. A day where you choose to enjoy some of the more indulgent things in life. In moderation, they are perfectly fine for you.</p><p><b>8. </b> I recommend tracking your progress with more than one metric. Most people will rely on the feedback from the scale. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this but due to numerous NATUAL factors, your weight can fluctuate up/down or stagnate for a period of time. Exercise, certain foods, and hormones can cause significant water retention. We all get constipated or dehydrated time-to-time. Get the idea? If seeing these fluctuations or plateaus impacts your mood, weigh less frequently. Additionally, consider taking tape measurements about once a month. Remember, after a while, a physically active lifestyle combined with a healthy diet can cause changes to your body composition in ways a scale cannot tell you. You may still be losing or gaining inches!</p><p><b>9.</b>Your journey is mental. Understand this now and get a head up on it. Try journaling about both your positive and tumultuous experiences, break down those feelings, and try to understand them. Your journey is not going to be difficult due to a lack of knowledge. It&rsquo;s difficult because many of us have been unkind and unfair to ourselves. Stop berating yourself. Stop comparing yourself. Stop making prerequisites to loving yourself. Start an amazing relationship with yourself. <b>Today!</b></p><h2>A Quick List of Stuff That is Complete and Utter Bullshit</h2><p><i>You may have a read a thing or two about this stuff..</i>.</p><p><b>Alkalizing Diets&ndash; </b>Different parts of the body maintain a different pH and the body desires homeostasis. Even if you could change the pH of your body, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to and the body will find a way to return it to normal. It&rsquo;s designed that way. </p><p><b>Superfoods&ndash; </b>These are just foods that previously had no horticultural value or target market. Some of them were even once considered weeds or garnish. Then, someone made up a trendy product, attributed an absurd value to it, and then the copycats followed. Most of them are no more valuable than what you can already find in the grocery store. Many of these are delicious, but several are expensive and not very special. If you stick with what you&rsquo;re already familiar with, you&rsquo;re getting more than enough nutrition and saving your money. </p><p><b>Detoxing&ndash;</b> Just. Don&rsquo;t. Skinny teas, juice fasts, and most herbal supplements are pretty much just starvation diets or &ldquo;cleanse&rdquo; you by means of inducing diarrhea. Infused water is tasty but is mostly a way to waste perfectly good produce. Here&rsquo;s a novel idea. Eat the fruit. Your digestive and renal systems do all the detoxing your body needs. Eat fiber, eat a selection of fruits + vegetables, and drink water and your visceral organs will do the rest!</p><p><b>Metabolism Boosting Foods and &ldquo;Belly Fat Melting&rdquo; Foods&ndash;Y</b>our potion of green tea, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper isn&rsquo;t going to boost your metabolism or burn fat in any meaningful way. It will taste disgusting and take the enamel off your teeth. Don&rsquo;t overthink it. Eat fresh food, drink water, and get active. That&rsquo;s it. Drink tea if you like it but any effect it has won&rsquo;t outdo poor habits.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Spot Reducing&ndash;</b> Doesn&rsquo;t exist. You can preserve or build muscle mass by performing an exercise, but no amount of that exercise will preferentially burn fat. Where we lose fat first depends mostly on genetics.</p></p>",
