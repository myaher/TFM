Almost twenty-eight vigilant hours and so far the street had been silent. The only sign of life was the small bird that had landed on the street sign, <i>Lemon Road</i>, stared at me for a time, and flown off into the distance when a gust of wind blew into its feathers.<b><br/></b></p><p>I\u2019d ditched my binoculars, having parked only a few spaces down from the property. I was watching a big brick house sat between two weatherboard ones. It had a low picket fence at the front and didn&rsquo;t strike me at all as the sort of thing a college student would live in. It was too <i>nice</i>.</p><p>I fidgeted in my seat, peeling my sweaty legs from the aged leather, keeping my eyes trained on the beige front door. The air conditioning was on, but my car still felt like a sauna in the sun. The sunglasses over my eyes didn&rsquo;t stop the glare from making me squint, barely able to concentrate on anything but the slight hum of my radio.</p><p>I was being inconspicuous.</p><p>I was also struggling to keep my eyes open. I was functioning on about three hours sleep and the slightly laid back position of my seat was making it far too comfortable. I could almost imagine myself in my own bed at home, head resting on not one but two soft pillows, my legs tangled up in my purple comforter - because it was far too hot to actually lie underneath - and the ticking of the clock on my wall, lulling me off to sleep. </p><p><i>Tap tap tap.</i></p><!-- more --><p>I had no bloody clue where I was. I do not recommend waking up in the middle of the day in your car on an unfamiliar street. Blinded by the sun, a moan slipped through my lips. Seconds passed where I stared at nothing but my hands, trying to figure out what I was doing. A quiet buzz echoed from an overworked fan and I finally remembered I was at a strangers house, trying to catch a cheater. </p><p>My heart skipped a beat when I looked to my left. Outside my car window stood a tall figure, hunched over to look in. He had his hands cupped over his face to shield the sun, and a crooked smile graced his lips.</p><p>It was <i>him</i>.</p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t ever seen him in person, but after receiving my \u2018assignment\u2019 I did a thorough job of stalking his Facebook profile (or the minimal parts of his profile I could view because I wasn\u2019t friends with him). And if this long-haired, dimple flashing, Hawaiian shirt wearing giant wasn&rsquo;t Harry Styles, then he must have a twin. </p><p>He tapped on my window again. What was I supposed to do? Cassidy hadn&rsquo;t given me instructions for if he came to speak to me. What the fuck? No one even considered the fact. Why didn\u2019t she prepare me for this?</p><p>Hesitantly, I did the only thing I could; I unlocked the car and let him open the door. He propped a ripped-denim-right-knee on the passenger seat and leant in, smirk growing as he took in my dishevelled appearance.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sitting outside my house for two days.&rdquo;</p><p>He was British? In all my research I had not found the slightest bit of evidence that he was foreign. In the back of my mind I thought this could only lead to more trouble if I were caught, <i>\u2018she was stalking that British guy</i>\u2019. He would get so much sympathy, he probably had connections with the Queen. Maybe that\u2019s why he lived in such a nice house off student campus, why he could afford to be dating the head bitch of a sorority. Also, I had no clue how to respond to that, so I said the first thing that came to my head: \u201cActually, I went home overnight.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and I took the opportunity to study him. He looked friendly enough. Up close, his eyes were a different green, the blue tint popping due to the horrid shirt he was wearing. His hair was greasy and it fell past his shoulders, it could have been longer than mine if the slight curls didn\u2019t cause it to bounce back up. The tattoos that covered one of his arms looked all sorts of tacky; almost like he went to the store - piss drunk - and asked the artist to ink a random array of meaningless crap sporadically across it. </p><p>&ldquo;Is that a camera?&rdquo; Harry asked, pulling me from my slightly offensive thoughts. His eyebrows were drawn in and he was pointing to my large DSLR. </p><p>I could only thank my lucky stars that I hadn\u2019t caught sight of him before, so there was no damning evidence he could take me to court with. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t a crime to own a camera, but before I could, he asked me another question that sent me into a spin. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you been taking photos of me?&rdquo; When was good cop going to arrive? I was already sick of his grilling me. It was hard to tell if he was angry or amused - a straight face complete with one set of very dead eyes made him difficult to gauge. I felt like he was the type of guy who would act entertained when you spilled wine on his carpet, but when you came over the next week, he won&rsquo;t let you drink anything and you\u2019d find a plastic sheet has been set out under the dining table. A passive little shit.</p><p>I scoffed. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; He froze. I froze. <i>I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say that</i>. I really wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say that.</p><p>It might have been five seconds, it might have been five minutes, but the silence following my stupid slip up was so so so painful. I could picture my death very clearly. Cassidy was going to go all <i>Sorority Row</i> on me - stick a tyre wrench through my heart and throw me in an abandoned well - swearing all her slaves to secrecy. She might even get him in on it, I\u2019m sure his royal money could buy silence.</p><p>Finally, he shook his head, eyes wide. &ldquo;The cute ones are always crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>The fact that he had just called me cute hadn\u2019t slipped my mind at all. In fact it simmered in there for a while. I wasn\u2019t cute. I hadn\u2019t slept properly in two days and I had attempted to quench my hunger with disgusting muesli bars and lukewarm coffee. I looked like Gollum. It was also gross that he could say such things to someone he didn\u2019t know while his girlfriend sat at home worried that he was cheating on her. </p><p>I opened and closed my mouth, trying to find something to say that could fix the situation. I failed. I think I was starting to get a headache with the 360 set of emotions this guy had, every second brought on a new face and a new unreadable mental state. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; He shook his head again, confused. My own confusion grew with his. &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; He began, running a hand through his hair, &ldquo;don\u2019t die.&rdquo; He shoved a bottle into my hand. It was cold, and I immediately felt less groggy with just the simple touch of it. It was filled with a dark green liquid. <i>Pressed Juice. Superfood Green</i>. Bet he spent over ten bucks on it.</p><p>I looked up to say something to him - probably a thank you for not calling the cops - but he was already pulling himself out of the car and closing the door, walking inside and looking back at me every few seconds, shaking his head all the while. I sure as hell took photos of him then.</p><hr><p>That night I sat on my couch, food simmering as I waited for mom to come home. I tried calling Marty as I flicked through stations on the tv.</p><p>Mom didn\u2019t come home. Marty didn\u2019t answer. My dinner went cold. </p><hr><p>He&rsquo;d given me carrot juice. The bright orange goo in the bottle looked sickening. I was no baby and I would not drink that. He could tell I was not impressed. &ldquo;You don\u2019t like carrots?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I returned the juice, barely holding back the scrunch of disgust in my nose. He shrugged his shoulders but stayed seated in the passenger seat of my car. The same way he had done for three days in a row.</p><p>He was wearing ripped up black jeans and another hideously colored button up. He had no shoes on and his grey socks were dirty from walking on the pavement. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell me why you&rsquo;re stalking me?&rdquo; He twisted the cap off and started drinking the juice. <i>Gross.</i></p><p>I shook my head, <i>no</i>, ignoring him the same way I had every time he asked, pulling the camera from next to me and snapping a photo of him. <i>Click.</i> &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re making my job very easy.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widened. &ldquo;So you admit it&rsquo;s a job!&rdquo; He looked like a child on Christmas day, his legs shaking from excitement and hands rubbing together. It was kind of cute - not that I cared. <i>Click</i>. \u201dBut if this is going to end up in a kidnapping and you\u2019re trying to scare me, you should probably stop wearing pink.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, looking at the pastel pink shift dress I was wearing. He had a point. I looked like baby spice in the early years. Maybe I <i>should\u2019ve</i> been drinking that juice.</p><p><i>Click</i>. Undeterred by my invasion of his privacy, he looked into the distance, his right thumb and forefinger pinching his bottom lip. At first I thought he was trying to model for me, but I then realised he was probably thinking long and hard <i>about</i> me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doing it for your own personal gain?&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed again, not really finding it funny though. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what I would gain by taking photos of some College student I don\u2019t even know.&rdquo; Harry really was an odd study. He had so far shown no signs of the spoilt brat I knew him to be, the English guy who dated sorority presidents and cheated on them with anyone he felt like. He potentially could have been spiking my juices every morning, but they were sealed bottles, so I doubt he was. </p><p>He shrugged, taking another sip of the disgusting liquid. \u201cPeople have done weirder things.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>People with motive</i> have done weirder things.\u201d Maybe Harry was one of those people.</p><p>He looked at me with a frown. \u201cWell, Maxine, I\u2019ve yet to learn your motive, so weird is still on the table.\u201d</p><p>Maxine? I hadn\u2019t told him my full name. In fact I was so careful not to do so, I didn\u2019t want to risk my cover.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, feigning nonchalance. He was seriously irking me. \u201cWell, despite what you may think,\u201d I pulled my phone out of his large hands, sending him a glare, \u201cI actually have other things I need to be doing.\u201d I waved my hands in the direction of his door. \u201cSo get out.\u201d </p><p>He laughed, resisting my pushing and prodding until I finally forced him onto the pavement. As soon as the door closed behind him I started the engine, slipping my sunglasses over my eyes and driving away, leaving him shaking his head at me from the sidewalk. He was an overgrown child.</p><hr><p>I was going to be late. My first Sunday dinner at the hell hole and I was going to be late for it. Harry had distracted me so much that afternoon with his interrogation and juvenile behaviour that I almost forgot I had the meeting. </p><p>The house looked the same as the last time I\u2019d been there. Only this time, I half knew what to expect, and rather than that putting my mind at ease, it set me on edge. I was not made for the nauseating cut and dry atmosphere Kappa Zeta Tau provided. As was evident from my own college adventures - the ones where I avoided the Greek system for all it was worth, unless there was a party that Liam dragged me to. </p><p>I took a deep breath before wrapping my knuckles twice on the paper white door. It opened in what I thought was record timing, the whoosh of air causing the whispy bits that had fallen from my ponytail to push back against my head. </p><p>\u201cMaxine.\u201d What was with people using my full name all the time? A slender girl with bleached blonde hair and dark blue eyes answered the door. Her body was wrapped in a peach coloured dress, leaving nothing about her curves to my imagination. I could actually see the indent of where her thong cut into her hips. </p><p>I gave her a smile, trying to ignore the anguish at hearing my name, and stopping my brain from mentally berating the girl for her choice in clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you\u2026\u201d That was the part where she was supposed to tell me her name so we could exchange further pleasantries and you know, act like normal people. But all I got was a raised eyebrow and a terribly disguised scoff. </p><p>She stepped out of the doorway, letting me in. I followed her into the dining room. The large table was set with expensive cutlery and crockery. Something actually smelled delicious. I was surprised, my assumption of the girls was that they didn\u2019t eat, or that they didn\u2019t eat things that smelled that good. </p><p>I almost dropped my bag when Cassidy appeared in front of me, seemingly out of nowhere. I wondered if she had cameras planted around the house just for the purpose of catching people off guard. </p><p>She smiled at me, the same devilish grin that had started haunting my sleep. \u201cSo lovely to grace us with your presence, Maxine.\u201d She made a big deal of looking at the delicate watch on her wrist. I wasn\u2019t really sure why she was making a fuss, I knocked on the door a full minute early. Note to self: arriving on time means arriving late.</p><p>\u201cDinner is bound to be cold by now,\u201d She raised an eyebrow at me, \u201cbut it will have to do.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was scolding. So hot that when I took my first bite I tried to spit it out, before remembering the company I was in, and grimaced while swallowing. My throat burned with every movement down, my eyes beginning to water with the pain. I took a large gulp of water afterwards and looked around the room. The whole table was silent, eerily so, and I was certain they had all been watching me seconds before.</p><p>I was uncomfortable that I hadn\u2019t seen Marty yet, I kept looking up at different noises around the room, hoping it would be her walking in, but she never came. After about my fourth look to the doorway, Cassidy dropped her fork with a large clang. I was mostly surprised by the action because I didn\u2019t think she would be eating at all, but she had finished off a fair portion of her broccoli in our time. </p><p>\u201cMartina won\u2019t be joining us this evening, so you can stop fidgeting about, it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.\u201d It was ironic, really, that Cassidy was uncomfortable in the house. I was the one who knew only one person, who wouldn\u2019t be attending, she knew every single one of those girls and she could tell them what to do. Her comfort should not have been relying on my fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I mumbled quietly, wishing my voice wouldn\u2019t betray my feelings like that. </p><p>We finished dinner rather quickly, no distractions of talking slowing it down at all. I was dragged into the sitting room, crisp couches and white walls familiar. The only new addition to the room was the corkboard sitting behind the pristine coffee table. It stood out like a sore thumb in the bright area, it\u2019s tan coloured legs attached to cheap wheels and the actual face of the cork looking used. It screamed second hand, something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever associate with Kappa Zeta Tau. </p><p>Cassidy sat down, with all the grace I imagined the queen would have, and gestured to the board with her eyebrows raised. It seemed like my time had come.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I reached into my handbag to retrieve the papers I had brought. Hastily I pinned them up, regretting not typing them or writing them out nicer. They were pages simply ripped out of my notebook with my messy scrawl across, as well as a few photos of Harry that I\u2019d taken of him stepping out of his house. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d I started, wiping my sweaty hands on my dress, \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry actually goes to many of his classes.\u201d It was true, Cassidy had given me his timetable and in the week I had been at his house, he hadn\u2019t seemed to leave or arrive in time with it. \u201cHe mostly stays in his house a lot. He hasn\u2019t had a visitor the entire time I\u2019ve been there - I\u2019m still not sure if he has a housemate.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest. When I looked back to her I swore I could see the depths of her soul in her frighteningly beautiful eyes, and boy her soul was not happy. </p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d She sighed, ignoring the overly loud snorts of the girls on the surrounding couches. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stationed for three days and the only information you\u2019ve got is that you think he\u2019s a loser.\u201d</p><p>She said <i>stationed</i> like my job here was official, like I was on a real stake-out working for a real authority. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was a loser.\u201d</p><p>Damn my mouth. Damn my stupid fat mouth. Cassidy took this response as a personal insult. </p><p>\u201cSo you like him?\u201d Her eyebrows were so far up her forehead I was scared they\u2019d just caterpillar right into her hairline. \u201cAre you trying to tell me you <i>like</i> my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Fuck. \u201cNo, I- I just know you have better taste than a loser.\u201d <i>Fuck</i>. I kept looking at the ground, my cheeks were so hot and I could feel sweat forming at my temples. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Cassidy went to looking at her perfect pink nails. \u201cJust do better.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, definitely motivated to try harder, never wanting to experience humiliation again if I could help it. </p><p>A few seconds passed where no one said or did anything. Cassidy looked up at me in confusion. \u201cWell get out.\u201d She waved her hands at me, shooing me to the front door. </p><p>Well excuse me. </p><p>I think I scuffed the patio railing with a ring on my rush out. Whoops. </p>",

I do not recommend waking up in the middle of the day in your car on an unfamiliar street. Blinded by the sun, a moan slipped through my lips. Seconds passed where I stared at nothing but my hands, trying to figure out what I was doing. A quiet buzz echoed from an overworked fan and I finally remembered I was at a strangers house, trying to catch a cheater. </p><p>My heart skipped a beat when I looked to my left. Outside my car window stood a tall figure, hunched over to look in. He had his hands cupped over his face to shield the sun, and a crooked smile graced his lips.</p><p>It was <i>him</i>.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t ever seen him in person, but after receiving my \u2018assignment\u2019 I did a thorough job of stalking his Facebook profile (or the minimal parts of his profile I could view because I wasn\u2019t friends with him). And if this long-haired, dimple flashing, Hawaiian shirt wearing giant wasn\u2019t Harry Styles, then he must have a twin. </p><p>He tapped on my window again. What was I supposed to do? Cassidy hadn\u2019t given me instructions for if he came to speak to me. What the fuck? No one even considered the fact. Why didn\u2019t she prepare me for this?</p><p>Hesitantly, I did the only thing I could; I unlocked the car and let him open the door. He propped a ripped-denim-right-knee on the passenger seat and leant in, smirk growing as he took in my dishevelled appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting outside my house for two days.\u201d</p><p>He was British? In all my research I had not found the slightest bit of evidence that he was foreign. In the back of my mind I thought this could only lead to more trouble if I were caught, <i>\u2018she was stalking that British guy</i>\u2019. He would get so much sympathy, he probably had connections with the Queen. Maybe that\u2019s why he lived in such a nice house off student campus, why he could afford to be dating the head bitch of a sorority.

Only this time, I half knew what to expect, and rather than that putting my mind at ease, it set me on edge. I was not made for the nauseating cut and dry atmosphere Kappa Zeta Tau provided. As was evident from my own college adventures - the ones where I avoided the Greek system for all it was worth, unless there was a party that Liam dragged me to. </p><p>I took a deep breath before wrapping my knuckles twice on the paper white door. It opened in what I thought was record timing, the whoosh of air causing the whispy bits that had fallen from my ponytail to push back against my head. </p><p>\u201cMaxine.\u201d What was with people using my full name all the time? A slender girl with bleached blonde hair and dark blue eyes answered the door. Her body was wrapped in a peach coloured dress, leaving nothing about her curves to my imagination. I could actually see the indent of where her thong cut into her hips. </p><p>I gave her a smile, trying to ignore the anguish at hearing my name, and stopping my brain from mentally berating the girl for her choice in clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you\u2026\u201d That was the part where she was supposed to tell me her name so we could exchange further pleasantries and you know, act like normal people. But all I got was a raised eyebrow and a terribly disguised scoff. </p><p>She stepped out of the doorway, letting me in. I followed her into the dining room. The large table was set with expensive cutlery and crockery. Something actually smelled delicious. I was surprised, my assumption of the girls was that they didn\u2019t eat, or that they didn\u2019t eat things that smelled that good. </p><p>I almost dropped my bag when Cassidy appeared in front of me, seemingly out of nowhere. I wondered if she had cameras planted around the house just for the purpose of catching people off guard. </p><p>She smiled at me, the same devilish grin that had started haunting my sleep. \u201cSo lovely to grace us with your presence, Maxine.\u201d She made a big deal of looking at the delicate watch on her wrist. I wasn\u2019t really sure why she was making a fuss, I knocked on the door a full minute early. Note to self: arriving on time means arriving late.</p><p>\u201cDinner is bound to be cold by now,\u201d She raised an eyebrow at me, \u201cbut it will have to do.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was scolding. So hot that when I took my first bite I tried to spit it out, before remembering the company I was in, and grimaced while swallowing. My throat burned with every movement down, my eyes beginning to water with the pain. I took a large gulp of water afterwards and looked around the room. The whole table was silent, eerily so, and I was certain they had all been watching me seconds before.</p><p>I was uncomfortable that I hadn\u2019t seen Marty yet, I kept looking up at different noises around the room, hoping it would be her walking in, but she never came. After about my fourth look to the doorway, Cassidy dropped her fork with a large clang. I was mostly surprised by the action because I didn\u2019t think she would be eating at all, but she had finished off a fair portion of her broccoli in our time. </p><p>\u201cMartina won\u2019t be joining us this evening, so you can stop fidgeting about, it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.\u201d It was ironic, really, that Cassidy was uncomfortable in the house. I was the one who knew only one person, who wouldn\u2019t be attending, she knew every single one of those girls and she could tell them what to do. Her comfort should not have been relying on my fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I mumbled quietly, wishing my voice wouldn\u2019t betray my feelings like that. </p><p>We finished dinner rather quickly, no distractions of talking slowing it down at all. I was dragged into the sitting room, crisp couches and white walls familiar. The only new addition to the room was the corkboard sitting behind the pristine coffee table. It stood out like a sore thumb in the bright area, it\u2019s tan coloured legs attached to cheap wheels and the actual face of the cork looking used. It screamed second hand, something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever associate with Kappa Zeta Tau. </p><p>Cassidy sat down, with all the grace I imagined the queen would have, and gestured to the board with her eyebrows raised. It seemed like my time had come.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I reached into my handbag to retrieve the papers I had brought. Hastily I pinned them up, regretting not typing them or writing them out nicer. They were pages simply ripped out of my notebook with my messy scrawl across, as well as a few photos of Harry that I\u2019d taken of him stepping out of his house. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d I started, wiping my sweaty hands on my dress, \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry actually goes to many of his classes.\u201d It was true, Cassidy had given me his timetable and in the week I had been at his house, he hadn\u2019t seemed to leave or arrive in time with it. \u201cHe mostly stays in his house a lot. He hasn\u2019t had a visitor the entire time I\u2019ve been there - I\u2019m still not sure if he has a housemate.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest. When I looked back to her I swore I could see the depths of her soul in her frighteningly beautiful eyes, and boy her soul was not happy. </p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d She sighed, ignoring the overly loud snorts of the girls on the surrounding couches. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stationed for three days and the only information you\u2019ve got is that you think he\u2019s a loser.\u201d</p><p>She said <i>stationed</i> like my job here was official, like I was on a real stake-out working for a real authority. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was a loser.\u201d</p><p>Damn my mouth. Damn my stupid fat mouth. Cassidy took this response as a personal insult. </p><p>\u201cSo you like him?\u201d Her eyebrows were so far up her forehead I was scared they\u2019d just caterpillar right into her hairline. \u201cAre you trying to tell me you <i>like</i> my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Fuck. \u201cNo, I- I just know you have better taste than a loser.\u201d <i>Fuck</i>. I kept looking at the ground, my cheeks were so hot and I could feel sweat forming at my temples. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Cassidy went to looking at her perfect pink nails. \u201cJust do better.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, definitely motivated to try harder, never wanting to experience humiliation again if I could help it. </p><p>A few seconds passed where no one said or did anything. Cassidy looked up at me in confusion. \u201cWell get out.\u201d She waved her hands at me, shooing me to the front door. </p><p>Well excuse me. </p><p>I think I scuffed the patio railing with a ring on my rush out. Whoops. </p></p>",

Almost twenty-eight vigilant hours and so far the street had been silent. The only sign of life was the small bird that had landed on the street sign, <i>Lemon Road</i>, stared at me for a time, and flown off into the distance when a gust of wind blew into its feathers.<b><br></b></p><p>I\u2019d ditched my binoculars, having parked only a few spaces down from the property. I was watching a big brick house sat between two weatherboard ones. It had a low picket fence at the front and didn\u2019t strike me at all as the sort of thing a college student would live in. It was too <i>nice</i>.</p><p>I fidgeted in my seat, peeling my sweaty legs from the aged leather, keeping my eyes trained on the beige front door. The air conditioning was on, but my car still felt like a sauna in the sun. The sunglasses over my eyes didn\u2019t stop the glare from making me squint, barely able to concentrate on anything but the slight hum of my radio.</p><p>I was being inconspicuous.</p><p>I was also struggling to keep my eyes open. I was functioning on about three hours sleep and the slightly laid back position of my seat was making it far too comfortable. I could almost imagine myself in my own bed at home, head resting on not one but two soft pillows, my legs tangled up in my purple comforter - because it was far too hot to actually lie underneath - and the ticking of the clock on my wall, lulling me off to sleep. </p><p><i>Tap tap tap.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>I had no bloody clue where I was. I do not recommend waking up in the middle of the day in your car on an unfamiliar street. Blinded by the sun, a moan slipped through my lips. Seconds passed where I stared at nothing but my hands, trying to figure out what I was doing. A quiet buzz echoed from an overworked fan and I finally remembered I was at a strangers house, trying to catch a cheater. </p><p>My heart skipped a beat when I looked to my left. Outside my car window stood a tall figure, hunched over to look in. He had his hands cupped over his face to shield the sun, and a crooked smile graced his lips.</p><p>It was <i>him</i>.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t ever seen him in person, but after receiving my \u2018assignment\u2019 I did a thorough job of stalking his Facebook profile (or the minimal parts of his profile I could view because I wasn\u2019t friends with him). And if this long-haired, dimple flashing, Hawaiian shirt wearing giant wasn\u2019t Harry Styles, then he must have a twin. </p><p>He tapped on my window again. What was I supposed to do? Cassidy hadn\u2019t given me instructions for if he came to speak to me. What the fuck? No one even considered the fact. Why didn\u2019t she prepare me for this?</p><p>Hesitantly, I did the only thing I could; I unlocked the car and let him open the door. He propped a ripped-denim-right-knee on the passenger seat and leant in, smirk growing as he took in my dishevelled appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting outside my house for two days.\u201d</p><p>He was British? In all my research I had not found the slightest bit of evidence that he was foreign. In the back of my mind I thought this could only lead to more trouble if I were caught, <i>\u2018she was stalking that British guy</i>\u2019. He would get so much sympathy, he probably had connections with the Queen. Maybe that\u2019s why he lived in such a nice house off student campus, why he could afford to be dating the head bitch of a sorority. Also, I had no clue how to respond to that, so I said the first thing that came to my head: \u201cActually, I went home overnight.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and I took the opportunity to study him. He looked friendly enough. Up close, his eyes were a different green, the blue tint popping due to the horrid shirt he was wearing. His hair was greasy and it fell past his shoulders, it could have been longer than mine if the slight curls didn\u2019t cause it to bounce back up. The tattoos that covered one of his arms looked all sorts of tacky; almost like he went to the store - piss drunk - and asked the artist to ink a random array of meaningless crap sporadically across it. </p><p>\u201cIs that a camera?\u201d Harry asked, pulling me from my slightly offensive thoughts. His eyebrows were drawn in and he was pointing to my large DSLR. </p><p>I could only thank my lucky stars that I hadn\u2019t caught sight of him before, so there was no damning evidence he could take me to court with. \u201cYes?\u201d I wanted to tell him that it wasn\u2019t a crime to own a camera, but before I could, he asked me another question that sent me into a spin. </p><p>\u201cHave you been taking photos of me?\u201d When was good cop going to arrive? I was already sick of his grilling me. It was hard to tell if he was angry or amused - a straight face complete with one set of very dead eyes made him difficult to gauge. I felt like he was the type of guy who would act entertained when you spilled wine on his carpet, but when you came over the next week, he won\u2019t let you drink anything and you\u2019d find a plastic sheet has been set out under the dining table. A passive little shit.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He froze. I froze. <i>I wasn\u2019t supposed to say that</i>. I really wasn\u2019t supposed to say that.</p><p>It might have been five seconds, it might have been five minutes, but the silence following my stupid slip up was so so so painful. I could picture my death very clearly. Cassidy was going to go all <i>Sorority Row</i> on me - stick a tyre wrench through my heart and throw me in an abandoned well - swearing all her slaves to secrecy. She might even get him in on it, I\u2019m sure his royal money could buy silence.</p><p>Finally, he shook his head, eyes wide. \u201cThe cute ones are always crazy.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he had just called me cute hadn\u2019t slipped my mind at all. In fact it simmered in there for a while. I wasn\u2019t cute. I hadn\u2019t slept properly in two days and I had attempted to quench my hunger with disgusting muesli bars and lukewarm coffee. I looked like Gollum. It was also gross that he could say such things to someone he didn\u2019t know while his girlfriend sat at home worried that he was cheating on her. </p><p>I opened and closed my mouth, trying to find something to say that could fix the situation. I failed. I think I was starting to get a headache with the 360 set of emotions this guy had, every second brought on a new face and a new unreadable mental state. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d He shook his head again, confused. My own confusion grew with his. \u201cJust,\u201d He began, running a hand through his hair, \u201cdon\u2019t die.\u201d He shoved a bottle into my hand. It was cold, and I immediately felt less groggy with just the simple touch of it. It was filled with a dark green liquid. <i>Pressed Juice. Superfood Green</i>. Bet he spent over ten bucks on it.</p><p>I looked up to say something to him - probably a thank you for not calling the cops - but he was already pulling himself out of the car and closing the door, walking inside and looking back at me every few seconds, shaking his head all the while. I sure as hell took photos of him then.</p><hr><p>That night I sat on my couch, food simmering as I waited for mom to come home. I tried calling Marty as I flicked through stations on the tv.</p><p>Mom didn\u2019t come home. Marty didn\u2019t answer. My dinner went cold. </p><hr><p>He\u2019d given me carrot juice. The bright orange goo in the bottle looked sickening. I was no baby and I would not drink that. He could tell I was not impressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t like carrots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I returned the juice, barely holding back the scrunch of disgust in my nose. He shrugged his shoulders but stayed seated in the passenger seat of my car. The same way he had done for three days in a row.</p><p>He was wearing ripped up black jeans and another hideously colored button up. He had no shoes on and his grey socks were dirty from walking on the pavement. </p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re stalking me?\u201d He twisted the cap off and started drinking the juice. <i>Gross.</i></p><p>I shook my head, <i>no</i>, ignoring him the same way I had every time he asked, pulling the camera from next to me and snapping a photo of him. <i>Click.</i> \u201cBut you\u2019re making my job very easy.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cSo you admit it\u2019s a job!\u201d He looked like a child on Christmas day, his legs shaking from excitement and hands rubbing together. It was kind of cute - not that I cared. <i>Click</i>. \u201dBut if this is going to end up in a kidnapping and you\u2019re trying to scare me, you should probably stop wearing pink.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, looking at the pastel pink shift dress I was wearing. He had a point. I looked like baby spice in the early years. Maybe I <i>should\u2019ve</i> been drinking that juice.</p><p><i>Click</i>. Undeterred by my invasion of his privacy, he looked into the distance, his right thumb and forefinger pinching his bottom lip. At first I thought he was trying to model for me, but I then realised he was probably thinking long and hard <i>about</i> me. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing it for your own personal gain?\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, not really finding it funny though. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I would gain by taking photos of some College student I don\u2019t even know.\u201d Harry really was an odd study. He had so far shown no signs of the spoilt brat I knew him to be, the English guy who dated sorority presidents and cheated on them with anyone he felt like. He potentially could have been spiking my juices every morning, but they were sealed bottles, so I doubt he was. </p><p>He shrugged, taking another sip of the disgusting liquid. \u201cPeople have done weirder things.\u201d </p><p>\u201c<i>People with motive</i> have done weirder things.\u201d Maybe Harry was one of those people.</p><p>He looked at me with a frown. \u201cWell, Maxine, I\u2019ve yet to learn your motive, so weird is still on the table.\u201d</p><p>Maxine? I hadn\u2019t told him my full name. In fact I was so careful not to do so, I didn\u2019t want to risk my cover.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, feigning nonchalance. He was seriously irking me. \u201cWell, despite what you may think,\u201d I pulled my phone out of his large hands, sending him a glare, \u201cI actually have other things I need to be doing.\u201d I waved my hands in the direction of his door. \u201cSo get out.\u201d </p><p>He laughed, resisting my pushing and prodding until I finally forced him onto the pavement. As soon as the door closed behind him I started the engine, slipping my sunglasses over my eyes and driving away, leaving him shaking his head at me from the sidewalk. He was an overgrown child.</p><hr><p>I was going to be late. My first Sunday dinner at the hell hole and I was going to be late for it. Harry had distracted me so much that afternoon with his interrogation and juvenile behaviour that I almost forgot I had the meeting. </p><p>The house looked the same as the last time I\u2019d been there. Only this time, I half knew what to expect, and rather than that putting my mind at ease, it set me on edge. I was not made for the nauseating cut and dry atmosphere Kappa Zeta Tau provided. As was evident from my own college adventures - the ones where I avoided the Greek system for all it was worth, unless there was a party that Liam dragged me to. </p><p>I took a deep breath before wrapping my knuckles twice on the paper white door. It opened in what I thought was record timing, the whoosh of air causing the whispy bits that had fallen from my ponytail to push back against my head. </p><p>\u201cMaxine.\u201d What was with people using my full name all the time? A slender girl with bleached blonde hair and dark blue eyes answered the door. Her body was wrapped in a peach coloured dress, leaving nothing about her curves to my imagination. I could actually see the indent of where her thong cut into her hips. </p><p>I gave her a smile, trying to ignore the anguish at hearing my name, and stopping my brain from mentally berating the girl for her choice in clothing. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you\u2026\u201d That was the part where she was supposed to tell me her name so we could exchange further pleasantries and you know, act like normal people.

Her comfort should not have been relying on my fidgeting.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I mumbled quietly, wishing my voice wouldn\u2019t betray my feelings like that. </p><p>We finished dinner rather quickly, no distractions of talking slowing it down at all. I was dragged into the sitting room, crisp couches and white walls familiar. The only new addition to the room was the corkboard sitting behind the pristine coffee table. It stood out like a sore thumb in the bright area, it\u2019s tan coloured legs attached to cheap wheels and the actual face of the cork looking used. It screamed second hand, something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever associate with Kappa Zeta Tau. </p><p>Cassidy sat down, with all the grace I imagined the queen would have, and gestured to the board with her eyebrows raised. It seemed like my time had come.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I reached into my handbag to retrieve the papers I had brought. Hastily I pinned them up, regretting not typing them or writing them out nicer. They were pages simply ripped out of my notebook with my messy scrawl across, as well as a few photos of Harry that I\u2019d taken of him stepping out of his house. </p><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d I started, wiping my sweaty hands on my dress, \u201cI don\u2019t think Harry actually goes to many of his classes.\u201d It was true, Cassidy had given me his timetable and in the week I had been at his house, he hadn\u2019t seemed to leave or arrive in time with it. \u201cHe mostly stays in his house a lot. He hasn\u2019t had a visitor the entire time I\u2019ve been there - I\u2019m still not sure if he has a housemate.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest. When I looked back to her I swore I could see the depths of her soul in her frighteningly beautiful eyes, and boy her soul was not happy. </p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d She sighed, ignoring the overly loud snorts of the girls on the surrounding couches. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stationed for three days and the only information you\u2019ve got is that you think he\u2019s a loser.\u201d</p><p>She said <i>stationed</i> like my job here was official, like I was on a real stake-out working for a real authority. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he was a loser.\u201d</p><p>Damn my mouth. Damn my stupid fat mouth. Cassidy took this response as a personal insult. </p><p>\u201cSo you like him?\u201d Her eyebrows were so far up her forehead I was scared they\u2019d just caterpillar right into her hairline. \u201cAre you trying to tell me you <i>like</i> my boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-\u201d Fuck. \u201cNo, I- I just know you have better taste than a loser.\u201d <i>Fuck</i>. I kept looking at the ground, my cheeks were so hot and I could feel sweat forming at my temples. </p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Cassidy went to looking at her perfect pink nails. \u201cJust do better.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, definitely motivated to try harder, never wanting to experience humiliation again if I could help it. </p><p>A few seconds passed where no one said or did anything. Cassidy looked up at me in confusion. \u201cWell get out.\u201d She waved her hands at me, shooing me to the front door. </p><p>Well excuse me. </p><p>I think I scuffed the patio railing with a ring on my rush out. Whoops. </p></p>",

Almost twenty-eight vigilant hours and so far the street had been silent. The only sign of life was the small bird that had landed on the street sign, <i>Lemon Road</i>, stared at me for a time, and flown off into the distance when a gust of wind blew into its feathers.<b><br /></b></p><p>I&rsquo;d ditched my binoculars, having parked only a few spaces down from the property. I was watching a big brick house sat between two weatherboard ones. It had a low picket fence at the front and didn&rsquo;t strike me at all as the sort of thing a college student would live in. It was too <i>nice</i>.</p><p>I fidgeted in my seat, peeling my sweaty legs from the aged leather, keeping my eyes trained on the beige front door. The air conditioning was on, but my car still felt like a sauna in the sun. The sunglasses over my eyes didn&rsquo;t stop the glare from making me squint, barely able to concentrate on anything but the slight hum of my radio.</p><p>I was being inconspicuous.</p><p>I was also struggling to keep my eyes open. I was functioning on about three hours sleep and the slightly laid back position of my seat was making it far too comfortable. I could almost imagine myself in my own bed at home, head resting on not one but two soft pillows, my legs tangled up in my purple comforter - because it was far too hot to actually lie underneath - and the ticking of the clock on my wall, lulling me off to sleep. </p><p><i>Tap tap tap.</i></p><p>I had no bloody clue where I was. I do not recommend waking up in the middle of the day in your car on an unfamiliar street. Blinded by the sun, a moan slipped through my lips. Seconds passed where I stared at nothing but my hands, trying to figure out what I was doing. A quiet buzz echoed from an overworked fan and I finally remembered I was at a strangers house, trying to catch a cheater. </p><p>My heart skipped a beat when I looked to my left. Outside my car window stood a tall figure, hunched over to look in. He had his hands cupped over his face to shield the sun, and a crooked smile graced his lips.</p><p>It was <i>him</i>.</p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t ever seen him in person, but after receiving my &lsquo;assignment&rsquo; I did a thorough job of stalking his Facebook profile (or the minimal parts of his profile I could view because I wasn&rsquo;t friends with him). And if this long-haired, dimple flashing, Hawaiian shirt wearing giant wasn&rsquo;t Harry Styles, then he must have a twin. </p><p>He tapped on my window again. What was I supposed to do? Cassidy hadn&rsquo;t given me instructions for if he came to speak to me. What the fuck? No one even considered the fact. Why didn&rsquo;t she prepare me for this?</p><p>Hesitantly, I did the only thing I could; I unlocked the car and let him open the door. He propped a ripped-denim-right-knee on the passenger seat and leant in, smirk growing as he took in my dishevelled appearance.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been sitting outside my house for two days.&rdquo;</p><p>He was British? In all my research I had not found the slightest bit of evidence that he was foreign. In the back of my mind I thought this could only lead to more trouble if I were caught, <i>&lsquo;she was stalking that British guy</i>&rsquo;. He would get so much sympathy, he probably had connections with the Queen. Maybe that&rsquo;s why he lived in such a nice house off student campus, why he could afford to be dating the head bitch of a sorority. Also, I had no clue how to respond to that, so I said the first thing that came to my head: &ldquo;Actually, I went home overnight.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his eyebrows and I took the opportunity to study him. He looked friendly enough. Up close, his eyes were a different green, the blue tint popping due to the horrid shirt he was wearing. His hair was greasy and it fell past his shoulders, it could have been longer than mine if the slight curls didn&rsquo;t cause it to bounce back up. The tattoos that covered one of his arms looked all sorts of tacky; almost like he went to the store - piss drunk - and asked the artist to ink a random array of meaningless crap sporadically across it. </p><p>&ldquo;Is that a camera?&rdquo; Harry asked, pulling me from my slightly offensive thoughts. His eyebrows were drawn in and he was pointing to my large DSLR. </p><p>I could only thank my lucky stars that I hadn&rsquo;t caught sight of him before, so there was no damning evidence he could take me to court with. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I wanted to tell him that it wasn&rsquo;t a crime to own a camera, but before I could, he asked me another question that sent me into a spin. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you been taking photos of me?&rdquo; When was good cop going to arrive? I was already sick of his grilling me. It was hard to tell if he was angry or amused - a straight face complete with one set of very dead eyes made him difficult to gauge. I felt like he was the type of guy who would act entertained when you spilled wine on his carpet, but when you came over the next week, he won&rsquo;t let you drink anything and you&rsquo;d find a plastic sheet has been set out under the dining table. A passive little shit.</p><p>I scoffed. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; He froze. I froze. <i>I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say that</i>. I really wasn&rsquo;t supposed to say that.</p><p>It might have been five seconds, it might have been five minutes, but the silence following my stupid slip up was so so so painful. I could picture my death very clearly. Cassidy was going to go all <i>Sorority Row</i> on me - stick a tyre wrench through my heart and throw me in an abandoned well - swearing all her slaves to secrecy. She might even get him in on it, I&rsquo;m sure his royal money could buy silence.</p><p>Finally, he shook his head, eyes wide. &ldquo;The cute ones are always crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>The fact that he had just called me cute hadn&rsquo;t slipped my mind at all. In fact it simmered in there for a while. I wasn&rsquo;t cute. I hadn&rsquo;t slept properly in two days and I had attempted to quench my hunger with disgusting muesli bars and lukewarm coffee. I looked like Gollum. It was also gross that he could say such things to someone he didn&rsquo;t know while his girlfriend sat at home worried that he was cheating on her. </p><p>I opened and closed my mouth, trying to find something to say that could fix the situation. I failed. I think I was starting to get a headache with the 360 set of emotions this guy had, every second brought on a new face and a new unreadable mental state. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; He shook his head again, confused. My own confusion grew with his. &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; He began, running a hand through his hair, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t die.&rdquo; He shoved a bottle into my hand. It was cold, and I immediately felt less groggy with just the simple touch of it. It was filled with a dark green liquid. <i>Pressed Juice. Superfood Green</i>. Bet he spent over ten bucks on it.</p><p>I looked up to say something to him - probably a thank you for not calling the cops - but he was already pulling himself out of the car and closing the door, walking inside and looking back at me every few seconds, shaking his head all the while. I sure as hell took photos of him then.</p><hr /><p>That night I sat on my couch, food simmering as I waited for mom to come home. I tried calling Marty as I flicked through stations on the tv.</p><p>Mom didn&rsquo;t come home. Marty didn&rsquo;t answer. My dinner went cold. </p><hr /><p>He&rsquo;d given me carrot juice. The bright orange goo in the bottle looked sickening. I was no baby and I would not drink that. He could tell I was not impressed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like carrots?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; I returned the juice, barely holding back the scrunch of disgust in my nose. He shrugged his shoulders but stayed seated in the passenger seat of my car. The same way he had done for three days in a row.</p><p>He was wearing ripped up black jeans and another hideously colored button up. He had no shoes on and his grey socks were dirty from walking on the pavement. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell me why you&rsquo;re stalking me?&rdquo; He twisted the cap off and started drinking the juice. <i>Gross.</i></p><p>I shook my head, <i>no</i>, ignoring him the same way I had every time he asked, pulling the camera from next to me and snapping a photo of him. <i>Click.</i> &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re making my job very easy.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes widened. &ldquo;So you admit it&rsquo;s a job!&rdquo; He looked like a child on Christmas day, his legs shaking from excitement and hands rubbing together. It was kind of cute - not that I cared. <i>Click</i>. &rdquo;But if this is going to end up in a kidnapping and you&rsquo;re trying to scare me, you should probably stop wearing pink.&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed, looking at the pastel pink shift dress I was wearing. He had a point. I looked like baby spice in the early years. Maybe I <i>should&rsquo;ve</i> been drinking that juice.</p><p><i>Click</i>. Undeterred by my invasion of his privacy, he looked into the distance, his right thumb and forefinger pinching his bottom lip. At first I thought he was trying to model for me, but I then realised he was probably thinking long and hard <i>about</i> me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doing it for your own personal gain?&rdquo;</p><p>I laughed again, not really finding it funny though. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what I would gain by taking photos of some College student I don&rsquo;t even know.&rdquo; Harry really was an odd study. He had so far shown no signs of the spoilt brat I knew him to be, the English guy who dated sorority presidents and cheated on them with anyone he felt like. He potentially could have been spiking my juices every morning, but they were sealed bottles, so I doubt he was. </p><p>He shrugged, taking another sip of the disgusting liquid. &ldquo;People have done weirder things.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;<i>People with motive</i> have done weirder things.&rdquo; Maybe Harry was one of those people.</p><p>He looked at me with a frown. &ldquo;Well, Maxine, I&rsquo;ve yet to learn your motive, so weird is still on the table.&rdquo;</p><p>Maxine? I hadn&rsquo;t told him my full name. In fact I was so careful not to do so, I didn&rsquo;t want to risk my cover.</p><p>I rolled my eyes, feigning nonchalance. He was seriously irking me. &ldquo;Well, despite what you may think,&rdquo; I pulled my phone out of his large hands, sending him a glare, &ldquo;I actually have other things I need to be doing.&rdquo; I waved my hands in the direction of his door. &ldquo;So get out.&rdquo; </p><p>He laughed, resisting my pushing and prodding until I finally forced him onto the pavement. As soon as the door closed behind him I started the engine, slipping my sunglasses over my eyes and driving away, leaving him shaking his head at me from the sidewalk. He was an overgrown child.</p><hr /><p>I was going to be late. My first Sunday dinner at the hell hole and I was going to be late for it. Harry had distracted me so much that afternoon with his interrogation and juvenile behaviour that I almost forgot I had the meeting. </p><p>The house looked the same as the last time I&rsquo;d been there. Only this time, I half knew what to expect, and rather than that putting my mind at ease, it set me on edge. I was not made for the nauseating cut and dry atmosphere Kappa Zeta Tau provided. As was evident from my own college adventures - the ones where I avoided the Greek system for all it was worth, unless there was a party that Liam dragged me to. </p><p>I took a deep breath before wrapping my knuckles twice on the paper white door. It opened in what I thought was record timing, the whoosh of air causing the whispy bits that had fallen from my ponytail to push back against my head. </p><p>&ldquo;Maxine.&rdquo; What was with people using my full name all the time? A slender girl with bleached blonde hair and dark blue eyes answered the door. Her body was wrapped in a peach coloured dress, leaving nothing about her curves to my imagination. I could actually see the indent of where her thong cut into her hips. </p><p>I gave her a smile, trying to ignore the anguish at hearing my name, and stopping my brain from mentally berating the girl for her choice in clothing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you&hellip;&rdquo; That was the part where she was supposed to tell me her name so we could exchange further pleasantries and you know, act like normal people. But all I got was a raised eyebrow and a terribly disguised scoff. </p><p>She stepped out of the doorway, letting me in. I followed her into the dining room. The large table was set with expensive cutlery and crockery. Something actually smelled delicious. I was surprised, my assumption of the girls was that they didn&rsquo;t eat, or that they didn&rsquo;t eat things that smelled that good. </p><p>I almost dropped my bag when Cassidy appeared in front of me, seemingly out of nowhere. I wondered if she had cameras planted around the house just for the purpose of catching people off guard. </p><p>She smiled at me, the same devilish grin that had started haunting my sleep. &ldquo;So lovely to grace us with your presence, Maxine.&rdquo; She made a big deal of looking at the delicate watch on her wrist. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure why she was making a fuss, I knocked on the door a full minute early. Note to self: arriving on time means arriving late.</p><p>&ldquo;Dinner is bound to be cold by now,&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow at me, &ldquo;but it will have to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Dinner was scolding. So hot that when I took my first bite I tried to spit it out, before remembering the company I was in, and grimaced while swallowing. My throat burned with every movement down, my eyes beginning to water with the pain. I took a large gulp of water afterwards and looked around the room. The whole table was silent, eerily so, and I was certain they had all been watching me seconds before.</p><p>I was uncomfortable that I hadn&rsquo;t seen Marty yet, I kept looking up at different noises around the room, hoping it would be her walking in, but she never came. After about my fourth look to the doorway, Cassidy dropped her fork with a large clang. I was mostly surprised by the action because I didn&rsquo;t think she would be eating at all, but she had finished off a fair portion of her broccoli in our time. </p><p>&ldquo;Martina won&rsquo;t be joining us this evening, so you can stop fidgeting about, it&rsquo;s making me uncomfortable.&rdquo; It was ironic, really, that Cassidy was uncomfortable in the house. I was the one who knew only one person, who wouldn&rsquo;t be attending, she knew every single one of those girls and she could tell them what to do. Her comfort should not have been relying on my fidgeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; I mumbled quietly, wishing my voice wouldn&rsquo;t betray my feelings like that. </p><p>We finished dinner rather quickly, no distractions of talking slowing it down at all. I was dragged into the sitting room, crisp couches and white walls familiar. The only new addition to the room was the corkboard sitting behind the pristine coffee table. It stood out like a sore thumb in the bright area, it&rsquo;s tan coloured legs attached to cheap wheels and the actual face of the cork looking used. It screamed second hand, something I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever associate with Kappa Zeta Tau. </p><p>Cassidy sat down, with all the grace I imagined the queen would have, and gestured to the board with her eyebrows raised. It seemed like my time had come.</p><p>My hands were shaking as I reached into my handbag to retrieve the papers I had brought. Hastily I pinned them up, regretting not typing them or writing them out nicer. They were pages simply ripped out of my notebook with my messy scrawl across, as well as a few photos of Harry that I&rsquo;d taken of him stepping out of his house. </p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; I started, wiping my sweaty hands on my dress, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Harry actually goes to many of his classes.&rdquo; It was true, Cassidy had given me his timetable and in the week I had been at his house, he hadn&rsquo;t seemed to leave or arrive in time with it. &ldquo;He mostly stays in his house a lot. He hasn&rsquo;t had a visitor the entire time I&rsquo;ve been there - I&rsquo;m still not sure if he has a housemate.&rdquo;</p><p>Cassidy&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change in the slightest. When I looked back to her I swore I could see the depths of her soul in her frighteningly beautiful eyes, and boy her soul was not happy. </p><p>&ldquo;Three days.&rdquo; She sighed, ignoring the overly loud snorts of the girls on the surrounding couches. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been stationed for three days and the only information you&rsquo;ve got is that you think he&rsquo;s a loser.&rdquo;</p><p>She said <i>stationed</i> like my job here was official, like I was on a real stake-out working for a real authority. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say he was a loser.&rdquo;</p><p>Damn my mouth. Damn my stupid fat mouth. Cassidy took this response as a personal insult. </p><p>&ldquo;So you like him?&rdquo; Her eyebrows were so far up her forehead I was scared they&rsquo;d just caterpillar right into her hairline. &ldquo;Are you trying to tell me you <i>like</i> my boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I-&rdquo; Fuck. &ldquo;No, I- I just know you have better taste than a loser.&rdquo; <i>Fuck</i>. I kept looking at the ground, my cheeks were so hot and I could feel sweat forming at my temples. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Cassidy went to looking at her perfect pink nails. &ldquo;Just do better.&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded, definitely motivated to try harder, never wanting to experience humiliation again if I could help it. </p><p>A few seconds passed where no one said or did anything.
