You heard him continue talking, at this point checking out of the conversation, knowing you could for a few minutes before having to tune back in. Peter was a sweet enough kid, but his optimism got on your nerves like no other. </p><p>He babbled on for a bit longer, you growing more and more frustrated, before rolling your eyes and yelling at him. \u201cAre you here to train or work out?\u201d <br/></p><p>You instantly felt bad, his large brown eyes </p><p><i><b>a peter parker fic (title is gonna be something like subways &amp; pajamas) about meeting peter on the metro (</b>last edited august 16, 2017 <strike>idk how to finish it</strike><b>)</b></i></p><p>The loud blaring from your alarm clock woke you up. Groaning you opened your eyes slightly, to see the obnoxiously bright red letters read 6:00am, before groaning once more, turning over, your arm reaching behind you, blindly attempting to hit the snooze button on your clock. After a few minutes of struggling, you finally hit it, the incessant blaring finally stopping. You sighed happily in relief, your eyes shutting again, feeling the warmth embrace of sleep return to you. Mere seconds after your eyes had fluttered shut, your alarm rang again, only for you to scrunch up your face in anger and annoyance, before turning back to face the alarm, and unplugging the goddamn thing. You grumbled angrily, before reaching for your fully charged phone, opening it up, squinting at the brightness that it held. How you hated the winter months. Getting up before the sun was up to get to school was a motherfucking nightmare. </p><p>You opened your phone, keeping an eye on the little time at the top of the screen, before opening up the first notification, it being snapchat, and completing your streaks. Your phone was right above you, and as you took a picture of the ceiling, the keyboard popping up for you to write your messages, your grip loosened, causing your phone to fall right on your face. You muttered a small \u201cow\u201d before picking up your phone and angrily typing in the word \u201cstreaks\u201d before sending them to your list of friends. You shut your phone, before reopennig it, checking the weather, muttering angrily when you realized that it might snow. You had nothing against snow, but you were upset that they didn\u2019t think to cancel school, because even though it probably wasn\u2019t going to snow, when it did snow it was always a lot. </p><p>You glanced warily at the time on the screen, realizing that you definitely had to get out of bed or you were going to be late, not wanting to leave the warm confines of your covers. You resigned as almost 5 minutes passed with you telling yourself to get up, before you finally did, your bare feet freezing on the floor. You walked out of your room, into the bathroom, before brushing your teeth, glad to get rid of morning breath, and doing your morning routine. You trudged back to your room, grabbing your fuzzy socks, and putting them on immediately, before throwing on sweatpants and a long sleeve pajama shirt, not caring that it had a ridiculously large kitten on it that said \u201cyou\u2019re purrrfect\u201d and pulling on your favorite sweater, before putting on your beanie and hood. You grabbed your backpack, put on your sneakers, put in your earbuds, and grabbed a juicebox before walking out the door, exiting your apartment building, carelessly opening your juice, cursing under your breath as you got outside, realizing that you didn\u2019t have gloves. </p><p>The taste of apple juice was obnoxious, seeing as how the minty flavor of your toothpaste hadn\u2019t quite receded, but you didn\u2019t complain. You quickly threw the emptied box into the nearest trash can, before sticking your hands into your pockets, trying to warm them up as best as you could. You walked through the crowded streets of New York City, people walking past you as speedily as you were walking, nobody looking at the bustle around the neighborhood. Entering the train station, you sighed happily, your hands coming out of your pocket and reaching for your metro card, stuffed in your phone case, entering the bustling train station, glad to not have missed your train. </p><p>As the train came whistling into the stations, the windows whizzing past you, the inside of the train filled with hoards of people, as the train slowed down, finally halting. You walked about two feet towards the nearest doors, waiting for the obnoxious amount of people to pour out of the train, before being able to slowly enter, and to your disappointment, but expectance, having to stand up, close to the door you had entered on. </p><p>You looked at your phone, mindlessly going through the same few apps, waiting for your stop, the number of people on the train slowly dwindling down. About two stops before your school, there was finally enough breathing room, and you moved slightly back, glad to have the extra space. You closed your phone and placed it in your pocket, bobbing your head slightly to the music blaring in your ears. You closed your eyes, allowing yourself to be transported, dancing around slightly, not caring if people were watching you. You were only stopped when someone walked behind you, shoving you forward, yourself being rammed into another person.</p><p>You felt your cheeks flush slightly, noticed the rather short boy you had bumped into, no older than yourself, somewhat scrawny looking, but from what you had felt, was in no means scrawny. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You told him, an awkward smile finding its way on your face as your embarrassment took over. \u00a0</p><p>He offered you a warm smile, before pulling out one of his earbuds, yourself doing the same. \u201cHmm?\u201d He asked, a little unaware and slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You repeated. You cleared your throat slightly, feeling the awkwardness inside of you take over. \u201cFor bumping into you.\u201d You clarified, though it sounded more like an afterthought. <br/></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s really no problem.\u201d He replied, stuttering slightly, looking around the train car, feeling the awkwardness in himself come out as well. \u201cBesides, it probably wasn\u2019t even your fault.\u201d He cleared his throat, a slight rosiness appearing on his cheeks. \u201cOne person gets shoved and everyone else does too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, the domino effect.\u201d You blurted out, mentally cursing yourself at your choice of wording, even if it was accurate. <br/></p><p>The boy laughed slightly. \u201cIt really is. I wish I didn\u2019t have to take public transportation ever.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the whole city wishes they never had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, can you imagine how much worse traffic would be if there was no metro?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt would be a complete nightmare. Honestly, like, if there was no metro I would have to wake up at freaking 4 in the morning to get to school on time.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Walking to school everyday would be a nightmare.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d You asked the boy, trying to see if you might recognize him. But then again, you may not; there were over 1000 students at your school, about 400 in your grade alone.<br/></p><p>\u201cMidtown High. You?\u201d He asked, motioning slightly with his head.<br/></p><p>\u201cSame, dude.\u201d You say, the two of you exchanging a sly smile. \u201c(Y/F/N).\u201d You offered, with a smile.</p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker.\u201d He said back, his initial awkwardness seeming to return.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell, Parker. What grade are you in? I haven\u2019t ever seen you around.\u201d <br/></p><p>\u201cSophmore.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d You reply, nodding, your awkwardness slowly coming back. You\u2019re eyes lit up in realization, before looking back at Peter. \u201cYou\u2019re Penis Parker!\u201d You blurted out, only to realize how awful that sounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just never met you, and I always here that douche, Flash, yell in the hallway, \u2018Penis Parker,\u2019 so I swear I didn\u2019t know, oh my god, I\u2019m a walking human disaster, howhaveInotdiedyet?\u201d You said rapidly, trying your best to profusely apologize. <br/></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine. I mean, at least I\u2019m not the girl who walks around in pajama shirts all the time.\u201d He said, throwing you a smug look, proud of the shade he had just thrown.<br/></p><p>You open your mouth indignantly, mock gasping, acting offended. \u201cWhy I never.\u201d </p><p>The two of you burst into laughter, before talking the rest of the way to school, deciding to try to find each other in the library during your free periods. And if you didn\u2019t, at least you had each others snapchats. You walked into first period, confident that you had made a new friend.</p><p><i><b>peter parker fic that i think i remember where it was going (ned was gonna set y\u2019all up) (</b>last edited: late august, 2017<b>)</b></i></p><p>Groaning, you lifted your head up and glanced at the clock realizing you only had 10 minutes left till the first weekend of the school year. You groaned again, slamming your head back onto the desk, not even caring enough to use your arms as a pillow. 10 minutes felt like an eternity. It seemed miraculous that you had managed to survive the first week of school, although it would be more of a miracle if you survived the last 10 minutes of the unholiness of school. Time seemed to slow down as the anticipation of the weekend came, each second seeming to tick slower than the one before it. As time seemed to slow, you seemed to accelerate, your fingers tapping idly on the desk, your knee starting to bounce Your mind started racing about your weekend plans, the most prominent one to go home and take a nice long soak in the tub, then binge watch Parks and Rec or High School Musical, whichever you were feeling, with your most comfortable sweats and a tub of ice cream. </p><p>You yawned slightly, rubbing your eyes, trying to fight the sleep that was threatening to overtake you, before glancing at the clock again, seeing that you still had another seven minutes. You looked up at the ceiling, trying to contain your frustration, doing the best not to yell out, boredom taking its hold over you. You didn\u2019t even have your stuff to put away to distract you from the boredom, having put it away a few minutes ago. </p><p>You glanced at the clock again, not even a minute had passed and this time you could not suppress your groan of frustration. You shot a death glare at the only person who dared to look at you, only afterwards feeling bad for Ned. Slamming your head onto the table in frustration, you closed your eyes, feeling tempted to stab them. You felt a wad of paper hit your head from the side, and you turned to look at the perpetrator, sticking your tongue out at Michelle as she she you her drawing of you \u201cin crisis\u201d, too lazy to flip her off. \u00a0</p><p>You grabbed your backpack from its place on the ground next to your chair and you set it on your lap, looking around the classroom to see that nobody else was paying attention, and the lack of caring on the teachers face. It was, after all, only the first week back and everyone was craving summer. </p><p>You opened your backpack, pulling out whatever book was in there, most likely one that you had already read. To your surprise and delight, you saw that you had forgotten to take out a Harry Potter book<i>, </i>so you opened it up and started from your favorite spot, chuckling to yourself silently at the antics of the characters. </p><p>Not only tree minutes after reading, you felt a piece of paper hit you, and you turned to glare back at Michelle, only to realize that this paper had letters written on it. You unfurled it, revealing the messy handwriting of the resident web-slinger, Peter Parker.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWanna hang out with Ned and me!?!?\u201d \u00a0</i></b></p><p>Smiling goofily, you grabbed your pen and scribbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><i><b>a peter maximoff film that i tried writing about a dream i had (</b>last edited: maybe february of 2018?? a little earlier<b>)(warning it makes no fucking sense,,,,,,,cause i was trying to recreate a dream)</b></i></p><p>You honestly had no idea how you had gotten into this situation. Sure, skiing was fun, and yeah, you wanted to spend some time with your friends, but it wasn\u2019t something on the top of your priorities. Honestly, looking back on it, it seemed like it was a dream, having no real recollection of why or how, or even when you guys had decided to go. All you knew was that you were more excited than you had originally anticipated. It was also great that you were actually really good at skiing, despite not having skied for a few years. <br/></p><p>Once the few of you had gotten to the small ski slope, you tucked your phone into your jacket, zipping up the pocket, difficultly slipping into the ski boots, silently cursing already at how tight they were. You were ready a few minutes before your friends, silently proud of your achievement, pulling out your phone to check the time, seeing that it was still relatively early. You smiled, glad to have the extra time to get a few runs in, putting on your skis and getting in line for the lift with one of your friends, chatting happily about nothing in particular. </p><p>Honestly, there should\u2019ve been something sketchy about the fact that there was a \u201cpick up a snowball and throw it while skiing\u201d challenge, but you really had no idea about why in the world you had decided that it would be a fun thing to do. And the fact that part of the challenge was based on not being tagged by too-gorgeous-to-be-human girls, made the challenge even weirder. Again, you had no idea how you had been roped into this. Maybe it was something that had to do with the fact that you seemed to have been standing in an active volcano range what felt like a few moments before?

You heard him continue talking, at this point checking out of the conversation, knowing you could for a few minutes before having to tune back in. Peter was a sweet enough kid, but his optimism got on your nerves like no other. </p><p>He babbled on for a bit longer, you growing more and more frustrated, before rolling your eyes and yelling at him. \u201cAre you here to train or work out?\u201d <br></p><p>You instantly felt bad, his large brown eyes </p><p><i><b>a peter parker fic (title is gonna be something like subways &amp; pajamas) about meeting peter on the metro (</b>last edited august 16, 2017 <strike>idk how to finish it</strike><b>)</b></i></p><p>The loud blaring from your alarm clock woke you up. Groaning you opened your eyes slightly, to see the obnoxiously bright red letters read 6:00am, before groaning once more, turning over, your arm reaching behind you, blindly attempting to hit the snooze button on your clock. After a few minutes of struggling, you finally hit it, the incessant blaring finally stopping. You sighed happily in relief, your eyes shutting again, feeling the warmth embrace of sleep return to you. Mere seconds after your eyes had fluttered shut, your alarm rang again, only for you to scrunch up your face in anger and annoyance, before turning back to face the alarm, and unplugging the goddamn thing. You grumbled angrily, before reaching for your fully charged phone, opening it up, squinting at the brightness that it held. How you hated the winter months. Getting up before the sun was up to get to school was a motherfucking nightmare. </p><p>You opened your phone, keeping an eye on the little time at the top of the screen, before opening up the first notification, it being snapchat, and completing your streaks. Your phone was right above you, and as you took a picture of the ceiling, the keyboard popping up for you to write your messages, your grip loosened, causing your phone to fall right on your face. You muttered a small \u201cow\u201d before picking up your phone and angrily typing in the word \u201cstreaks\u201d before sending them to your list of friends. You shut your phone, before reopennig it, checking the weather, muttering angrily when you realized that it might snow. You had nothing against snow, but you were upset that they didn\u2019t think to cancel school, because even though it probably wasn\u2019t going to snow, when it did snow it was always a lot. </p><p>You glanced warily at the time on the screen, realizing that you definitely had to get out of bed or you were going to be late, not wanting to leave the warm confines of your covers. You resigned as almost 5 minutes passed with you telling yourself to get up, before you finally did, your bare feet freezing on the floor. You walked out of your room, into the bathroom, before brushing your teeth, glad to get rid of morning breath, and doing your morning routine. You trudged back to your room, grabbing your fuzzy socks, and putting them on immediately, before throwing on sweatpants and a long sleeve pajama shirt, not caring that it had a ridiculously large kitten on it that said \u201cyou\u2019re purrrfect\u201d and pulling on your favorite sweater, before putting on your beanie and hood. You grabbed your backpack, put on your sneakers, put in your earbuds, and grabbed a juicebox before walking out the door, exiting your apartment building, carelessly opening your juice, cursing under your breath as you got outside, realizing that you didn\u2019t have gloves. </p><p>The taste of apple juice was obnoxious, seeing as how the minty flavor of your toothpaste hadn\u2019t quite receded, but you didn\u2019t complain. You quickly threw the emptied box into the nearest trash can, before sticking your hands into your pockets, trying to warm them up as best as you could. You walked through the crowded streets of New York City, people walking past you as speedily as you were walking, nobody looking at the bustle around the neighborhood. Entering the train station, you sighed happily, your hands coming out of your pocket and reaching for your metro card, stuffed in your phone case, entering the bustling train station, glad to not have missed your train. </p><p>As the train came whistling into the stations, the windows whizzing past you, the inside of the train filled with hoards of people, as the train slowed down, finally halting. You walked about two feet towards the nearest doors, waiting for the obnoxious amount of people to pour out of the train, before being able to slowly enter, and to your disappointment, but expectance, having to stand up, close to the door you had entered on. </p><p>You looked at your phone, mindlessly going through the same few apps, waiting for your stop, the number of people on the train slowly dwindling down. About two stops before your school, there was finally enough breathing room, and you moved slightly back, glad to have the extra space. You closed your phone and placed it in your pocket, bobbing your head slightly to the music blaring in your ears. You closed your eyes, allowing yourself to be transported, dancing around slightly, not caring if people were watching you. You were only stopped when someone walked behind you, shoving you forward, yourself being rammed into another person.</p><p>You felt your cheeks flush slightly, noticed the rather short boy you had bumped into, no older than yourself, somewhat scrawny looking, but from what you had felt, was in no means scrawny. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You told him, an awkward smile finding its way on your face as your embarrassment took over. \u00a0</p><p>He offered you a warm smile, before pulling out one of his earbuds, yourself doing the same. \u201cHmm?\u201d He asked, a little unaware and slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You repeated. You cleared your throat slightly, feeling the awkwardness inside of you take over. \u201cFor bumping into you.\u201d You clarified, though it sounded more like an afterthought. <br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s really no problem.\u201d He replied, stuttering slightly, looking around the train car, feeling the awkwardness in himself come out as well. \u201cBesides, it probably wasn\u2019t even your fault.\u201d He cleared his throat, a slight rosiness appearing on his cheeks. \u201cOne person gets shoved and everyone else does too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, the domino effect.\u201d You blurted out, mentally cursing yourself at your choice of wording, even if it was accurate. <br></p><p>The boy laughed slightly. \u201cIt really is. I wish I didn\u2019t have to take public transportation ever.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the whole city wishes they never had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, can you imagine how much worse traffic would be if there was no metro?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt would be a complete nightmare. Honestly, like, if there was no metro I would have to wake up at freaking 4 in the morning to get to school on time.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Walking to school everyday would be a nightmare.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d You asked the boy, trying to see if you might recognize him. But then again, you may not; there were over 1000 students at your school, about 400 in your grade alone.<br></p><p>\u201cMidtown High. You?\u201d He asked, motioning slightly with his head.<br></p><p>\u201cSame, dude.\u201d You say, the two of you exchanging a sly smile. \u201c(Y/F/N).\u201d You offered, with a smile.</p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker.\u201d He said back, his initial awkwardness seeming to return.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, Parker. What grade are you in? I haven\u2019t ever seen you around.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSophmore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d You reply, nodding, your awkwardness slowly coming back. You\u2019re eyes lit up in realization, before looking back at Peter. \u201cYou\u2019re Penis Parker!\u201d You blurted out, only to realize how awful that sounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just never met you, and I always here that douche, Flash, yell in the hallway, \u2018Penis Parker,\u2019 so I swear I didn\u2019t know, oh my god, I\u2019m a walking human disaster, howhaveInotdiedyet?\u201d You said rapidly, trying your best to profusely apologize. <br></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine. I mean, at least I\u2019m not the girl who walks around in pajama shirts all the time.\u201d He said, throwing you a smug look, proud of the shade he had just thrown.<br></p><p>You open your mouth indignantly, mock gasping, acting offended. \u201cWhy I never.\u201d </p><p>The two of you burst into laughter, before talking the rest of the way to school, deciding to try to find each other in the library during your free periods. And if you didn\u2019t, at least you had each others snapchats. You walked into first period, confident that you had made a new friend.</p><p><i><b>peter parker fic that i think i remember where it was going (ned was gonna set y\u2019all up) (</b>last edited: late august, 2017<b>)</b></i></p><p>Groaning, you lifted your head up and glanced at the clock realizing you only had 10 minutes left till the first weekend of the school year. You groaned again, slamming your head back onto the desk, not even caring enough to use your arms as a pillow. 10 minutes felt like an eternity. It seemed miraculous that you had managed to survive the first week of school, although it would be more of a miracle if you survived the last 10 minutes of the unholiness of school. Time seemed to slow down as the anticipation of the weekend came, each second seeming to tick slower than the one before it. As time seemed to slow, you seemed to accelerate, your fingers tapping idly on the desk, your knee starting to bounce Your mind started racing about your weekend plans, the most prominent one to go home and take a nice long soak in the tub, then binge watch Parks and Rec or High School Musical, whichever you were feeling, with your most comfortable sweats and a tub of ice cream. </p><p>You yawned slightly, rubbing your eyes, trying to fight the sleep that was threatening to overtake you, before glancing at the clock again, seeing that you still had another seven minutes. You looked up at the ceiling, trying to contain your frustration, doing the best not to yell out, boredom taking its hold over you. You didn\u2019t even have your stuff to put away to distract you from the boredom, having put it away a few minutes ago. </p><p>You glanced at the clock again, not even a minute had passed and this time you could not suppress your groan of frustration. You shot a death glare at the only person who dared to look at you, only afterwards feeling bad for Ned. Slamming your head onto the table in frustration, you closed your eyes, feeling tempted to stab them. You felt a wad of paper hit your head from the side, and you turned to look at the perpetrator, sticking your tongue out at Michelle as she she you her drawing of you \u201cin crisis\u201d, too lazy to flip her off. \u00a0</p><p>You grabbed your backpack from its place on the ground next to your chair and you set it on your lap, looking around the classroom to see that nobody else was paying attention, and the lack of caring on the teachers face. It was, after all, only the first week back and everyone was craving summer. </p><p>You opened your backpack, pulling out whatever book was in there, most likely one that you had already read. To your surprise and delight, you saw that you had forgotten to take out a Harry Potter book<i>, </i>so you opened it up and started from your favorite spot, chuckling to yourself silently at the antics of the characters. </p><p>Not only tree minutes after reading, you felt a piece of paper hit you, and you turned to glare back at Michelle, only to realize that this paper had letters written on it. You unfurled it, revealing the messy handwriting of the resident web-slinger, Peter Parker.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWanna hang out with Ned and me!?!?\u201d \u00a0</i></b></p><p>Smiling goofily, you grabbed your pen and scribbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><i><b>a peter maximoff film that i tried writing about a dream i had (</b>last edited: maybe february of 2018?? a little earlier<b>)(warning it makes no fucking sense,,,,,,,cause i was trying to recreate a dream)</b></i></p><p>You honestly had no idea how you had gotten into this situation. Sure, skiing was fun, and yeah, you wanted to spend some time with your friends, but it wasn\u2019t something on the top of your priorities. Honestly, looking back on it, it seemed like it was a dream, having no real recollection of why or how, or even when you guys had decided to go. All you knew was that you were more excited than you had originally anticipated. It was also great that you were actually really good at skiing, despite not having skied for a few years. <br></p><p>Once the few of you had gotten to the small ski slope, you tucked your phone into your jacket, zipping up the pocket, difficultly slipping into the ski boots, silently cursing already at how tight they were. You were ready a few minutes before your friends, silently proud of your achievement, pulling out your phone to check the time, seeing that it was still relatively early. You smiled, glad to have the extra time to get a few runs in, putting on your skis and getting in line for the lift with one of your friends, chatting happily about nothing in particular. </p><p>Honestly, there should\u2019ve been something sketchy about the fact that there was a \u201cpick up a snowball and throw it while skiing\u201d challenge, but you really had no idea about why in the world you had decided that it would be a fun thing to do. And the fact that part of the challenge was based on not being tagged by too-gorgeous-to-be-human girls, made the challenge even weirder. Again, you had no idea how you had been roped into this. Maybe it was something that had to do with the fact that you seemed to have been standing in an active volcano range what felt like a few moments before? Probably. </p><p>Somehow, everyone else was failing, and honestly you had no idea how they possibly could\u2019ve been. It was so simple, and honestly you were ready to beat their asses.

Groaning you opened your eyes slightly, to see the obnoxiously bright red letters read 6:00am, before groaning once more, turning over, your arm reaching behind you, blindly attempting to hit the snooze button on your clock. After a few minutes of struggling, you finally hit it, the incessant blaring finally stopping. You sighed happily in relief, your eyes shutting again, feeling the warmth embrace of sleep return to you. Mere seconds after your eyes had fluttered shut, your alarm rang again, only for you to scrunch up your face in anger and annoyance, before turning back to face the alarm, and unplugging the goddamn thing. You grumbled angrily, before reaching for your fully charged phone, opening it up, squinting at the brightness that it held. How you hated the winter months. Getting up before the sun was up to get to school was a motherfucking nightmare. </p><p>You opened your phone, keeping an eye on the little time at the top of the screen, before opening up the first notification, it being snapchat, and completing your streaks. Your phone was right above you, and as you took a picture of the ceiling, the keyboard popping up for you to write your messages, your grip loosened, causing your phone to fall right on your face. You muttered a small \u201cow\u201d before picking up your phone and angrily typing in the word \u201cstreaks\u201d before sending them to your list of friends. You shut your phone, before reopennig it, checking the weather, muttering angrily when you realized that it might snow. You had nothing against snow, but you were upset that they didn\u2019t think to cancel school, because even though it probably wasn\u2019t going to snow, when it did snow it was always a lot. </p><p>You glanced warily at the time on the screen, realizing that you definitely had to get out of bed or you were going to be late, not wanting to leave the warm confines of your covers. You resigned as almost 5 minutes passed with you telling yourself to get up, before you finally did, your bare feet freezing on the floor. You walked out of your room, into the bathroom, before brushing your teeth, glad to get rid of morning breath, and doing your morning routine. You trudged back to your room, grabbing your fuzzy socks, and putting them on immediately, before throwing on sweatpants and a long sleeve pajama shirt, not caring that it had a ridiculously large kitten on it that said \u201cyou\u2019re purrrfect\u201d and pulling on your favorite sweater, before putting on your beanie and hood. You grabbed your backpack, put on your sneakers, put in your earbuds, and grabbed a juicebox before walking out the door, exiting your apartment building, carelessly opening your juice, cursing under your breath as you got outside, realizing that you didn\u2019t have gloves. </p><p>The taste of apple juice was obnoxious, seeing as how the minty flavor of your toothpaste hadn\u2019t quite receded, but you didn\u2019t complain. You quickly threw the emptied box into the nearest trash can, before sticking your hands into your pockets, trying to warm them up as best as you could. You walked through the crowded streets of New York City, people walking past you as speedily as you were walking, nobody looking at the bustle around the neighborhood. Entering the train station, you sighed happily, your hands coming out of your pocket and reaching for your metro card, stuffed in your phone case, entering the bustling train station, glad to not have missed your train. </p><p>As the train came whistling into the stations, the windows whizzing past you, the inside of the train filled with hoards of people, as the train slowed down, finally halting. You walked about two feet towards the nearest doors, waiting for the obnoxious amount of people to pour out of the train, before being able to slowly enter, and to your disappointment, but expectance, having to stand up, close to the door you had entered on. </p><p>You looked at your phone, mindlessly going through the same few apps, waiting for your stop, the number of people on the train slowly dwindling down. About two stops before your school, there was finally enough breathing room, and you moved slightly back, glad to have the extra space. You closed your phone and placed it in your pocket, bobbing your head slightly to the music blaring in your ears. You closed your eyes, allowing yourself to be transported, dancing around slightly, not caring if people were watching you. You were only stopped when someone walked behind you, shoving you forward, yourself being rammed into another person.</p><p>You felt your cheeks flush slightly, noticed the rather short boy you had bumped into, no older than yourself, somewhat scrawny looking, but from what you had felt, was in no means scrawny. </p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You told him, an awkward smile finding its way on your face as your embarrassment took over. \u00a0</p><p>He offered you a warm smile, before pulling out one of his earbuds, yourself doing the same. \u201cHmm?\u201d He asked, a little unaware and slightly confused.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d You repeated. You cleared your throat slightly, feeling the awkwardness inside of you take over. \u201cFor bumping into you.\u201d You clarified, though it sounded more like an afterthought. <br></p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s really no problem.\u201d He replied, stuttering slightly, looking around the train car, feeling the awkwardness in himself come out as well. \u201cBesides, it probably wasn\u2019t even your fault.\u201d He cleared his throat, a slight rosiness appearing on his cheeks. \u201cOne person gets shoved and everyone else does too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, the domino effect.\u201d You blurted out, mentally cursing yourself at your choice of wording, even if it was accurate. <br></p><p>The boy laughed slightly. \u201cIt really is. I wish I didn\u2019t have to take public transportation ever.\u201d</p><p>You laughed at that. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the whole city wishes they never had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god, can you imagine how much worse traffic would be if there was no metro?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt would be a complete nightmare. Honestly, like, if there was no metro I would have to wake up at freaking 4 in the morning to get to school on time.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Walking to school everyday would be a nightmare.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d You asked the boy, trying to see if you might recognize him. But then again, you may not; there were over 1000 students at your school, about 400 in your grade alone.<br></p><p>\u201cMidtown High. You?\u201d He asked, motioning slightly with his head.<br></p><p>\u201cSame, dude.\u201d You say, the two of you exchanging a sly smile. \u201c(Y/F/N).\u201d You offered, with a smile.</p><p>\u201cUm, Peter Parker.\u201d He said back, his initial awkwardness seeming to return.<br></p><p>\u201cWell, Parker. What grade are you in? I haven\u2019t ever seen you around.\u201d <br></p><p>\u201cSophmore.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d You reply, nodding, your awkwardness slowly coming back. You\u2019re eyes lit up in realization, before looking back at Peter. \u201cYou\u2019re Penis Parker!\u201d You blurted out, only to realize how awful that sounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just never met you, and I always here that douche, Flash, yell in the hallway, \u2018Penis Parker,\u2019 so I swear I didn\u2019t know, oh my god, I\u2019m a walking human disaster, howhaveInotdiedyet?\u201d You said rapidly, trying your best to profusely apologize. <br></p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s fine. I mean, at least I\u2019m not the girl who walks around in pajama shirts all the time.\u201d He said, throwing you a smug look, proud of the shade he had just thrown.<br></p><p>You open your mouth indignantly, mock gasping, acting offended. \u201cWhy I never.\u201d </p><p>The two of you burst into laughter, before talking the rest of the way to school, deciding to try to find each other in the library during your free periods. And if you didn\u2019t, at least you had each others snapchats. You walked into first period, confident that you had made a new friend.</p><p><i><b>peter parker fic that i think i remember where it was going (ned was gonna set y\u2019all up) (</b>last edited: late august, 2017<b>)</b></i></p><p>Groaning, you lifted your head up and glanced at the clock realizing you only had 10 minutes left till the first weekend of the school year. You groaned again, slamming your head back onto the desk, not even caring enough to use your arms as a pillow. 10 minutes felt like an eternity. It seemed miraculous that you had managed to survive the first week of school, although it would be more of a miracle if you survived the last 10 minutes of the unholiness of school. Time seemed to slow down as the anticipation of the weekend came, each second seeming to tick slower than the one before it. As time seemed to slow, you seemed to accelerate, your fingers tapping idly on the desk, your knee starting to bounce Your mind started racing about your weekend plans, the most prominent one to go home and take a nice long soak in the tub, then binge watch Parks and Rec or High School Musical, whichever you were feeling, with your most comfortable sweats and a tub of ice cream. </p><p>You yawned slightly, rubbing your eyes, trying to fight the sleep that was threatening to overtake you, before glancing at the clock again, seeing that you still had another seven minutes. You looked up at the ceiling, trying to contain your frustration, doing the best not to yell out, boredom taking its hold over you. You didn\u2019t even have your stuff to put away to distract you from the boredom, having put it away a few minutes ago. </p><p>You glanced at the clock again, not even a minute had passed and this time you could not suppress your groan of frustration. You shot a death glare at the only person who dared to look at you, only afterwards feeling bad for Ned. Slamming your head onto the table in frustration, you closed your eyes, feeling tempted to stab them. You felt a wad of paper hit your head from the side, and you turned to look at the perpetrator, sticking your tongue out at Michelle as she she you her drawing of you \u201cin crisis\u201d, too lazy to flip her off. \u00a0</p><p>You grabbed your backpack from its place on the ground next to your chair and you set it on your lap, looking around the classroom to see that nobody else was paying attention, and the lack of caring on the teachers face. It was, after all, only the first week back and everyone was craving summer. </p><p>You opened your backpack, pulling out whatever book was in there, most likely one that you had already read. To your surprise and delight, you saw that you had forgotten to take out a Harry Potter book<i>, </i>so you opened it up and started from your favorite spot, chuckling to yourself silently at the antics of the characters. </p><p>Not only tree minutes after reading, you felt a piece of paper hit you, and you turned to glare back at Michelle, only to realize that this paper had letters written on it. You unfurled it, revealing the messy handwriting of the resident web-slinger, Peter Parker.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWanna hang out with Ned and me!?!?\u201d \u00a0</i></b></p><p>Smiling goofily, you grabbed your pen and scribbled, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p><i><b>a peter maximoff film that i tried writing about a dream i had (</b>last edited: maybe february of 2018?? a little earlier<b>)(warning it makes no fucking sense,,,,,,,cause i was trying to recreate a dream)</b></i></p><p>You honestly had no idea how you had gotten into this situation. Sure, skiing was fun, and yeah, you wanted to spend some time with your friends, but it wasn\u2019t something on the top of your priorities. Honestly, looking back on it, it seemed like it was a dream, having no real recollection of why or how, or even when you guys had decided to go. All you knew was that you were more excited than you had originally anticipated. It was also great that you were actually really good at skiing, despite not having skied for a few years. <br></p><p>Once the few of you had gotten to the small ski slope, you tucked your phone into your jacket, zipping up the pocket, difficultly slipping into the ski boots, silently cursing already at how tight they were. You were ready a few minutes before your friends, silently proud of your achievement, pulling out your phone to check the time, seeing that it was still relatively early. You smiled, glad to have the extra time to get a few runs in, putting on your skis and getting in line for the lift with one of your friends, chatting happily about nothing in particular. </p><p>Honestly, there should\u2019ve been something sketchy about the fact that there was a \u201cpick up a snowball and throw it while skiing\u201d challenge, but you really had no idea about why in the world you had decided that it would be a fun thing to do. And the fact that part of the challenge was based on not being tagged by too-gorgeous-to-be-human girls, made the challenge even weirder. Again, you had no idea how you had been roped into this. Maybe it was something that had to do with the fact that you seemed to have been standing in an active volcano range what felt like a few moments before? Probably. </p><p>Somehow, everyone else was failing, and honestly you had no idea how they possibly could\u2019ve been. It was so simple, and honestly you were ready to beat their asses. When it came to your turn, you felt the a</p><p><i><b>a gertchase x reader fic about sitting on the couch and loving your bf and gf (</b>last edited: january of 2018<b>)</b></i></p><p>\u201cDating is so heteronormative.\u201d Gert spoke, earning an amused eyeroll from you as you flipped the page of your book, not even bothering to look up knowing the playfully hurt look that would be on Chase\u2019s face, a hand over his heart in mock hurt.<br></p><p>\u201cThanks babe.\u201d You had replied sarcastically, looking up only when you heard a gasp of over-exaggerated offense, reminding you of a shady grandma, snorting slightly as your mind produced the image of Chase wearing an apron and mary-jane shoes, a smirk making its way onto your face as you looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI happen to be heterosexual, and seem to be doing perfectly find.

A gradual numbing sensation slowly crawling up your body, before it started ti burn, the flickering sensation of pain engaging your every nerve. The pain flickered, seeming to engulf your entire body, seeming almost suffocating as you tried to scream out in pain and desperation though your muscles would not allow you to move. Your entire body seemed to tighten, biting down harshly on your tongue to keep from crying out as your arm slowly raised, the higher your arm moved, the more your body seemed to burn, and you could almost feel your flesh begin to burn, a smell of singed flesh overwhelming you as your arm continued to move higher and higher, the weight in your hand feeling unnatural despite the constant weight of the item which you normally grasped so easily. Bile seemed to form in your mouth, feeling sweat form, your skin pricking at the feeling of uneasiness which settled in your stomach, time seeming to stand even more still as you did your best to avoid the blue eyes which stared back at you, the fear apparent seeming to pierce through you as you closed your eyes tightly, breathing shakily, before opening them, pulling the trigger instantly, the sound of a muffled gunshot, the body hitting the floor.

Getting up before the sun was up to get to school was a motherfucking nightmare. </p><p>You opened your phone, keeping an eye on the little time at the top of the screen, before opening up the first notification, it being snapchat, and completing your streaks. Your phone was right above you, and as you took a picture of the ceiling, the keyboard popping up for you to write your messages, your grip loosened, causing your phone to fall right on your face. You muttered a small &ldquo;ow&rdquo; before picking up your phone and angrily typing in the word &ldquo;streaks&rdquo; before sending them to your list of friends. You shut your phone, before reopennig it, checking the weather, muttering angrily when you realized that it might snow. You had nothing against snow, but you were upset that they didn&rsquo;t think to cancel school, because even though it probably wasn&rsquo;t going to snow, when it did snow it was always a lot. </p><p>You glanced warily at the time on the screen, realizing that you definitely had to get out of bed or you were going to be late, not wanting to leave the warm confines of your covers. You resigned as almost 5 minutes passed with you telling yourself to get up, before you finally did, your bare feet freezing on the floor. You walked out of your room, into the bathroom, before brushing your teeth, glad to get rid of morning breath, and doing your morning routine. You trudged back to your room, grabbing your fuzzy socks, and putting them on immediately, before throwing on sweatpants and a long sleeve pajama shirt, not caring that it had a ridiculously large kitten on it that said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re purrrfect&rdquo; and pulling on your favorite sweater, before putting on your beanie and hood. You grabbed your backpack, put on your sneakers, put in your earbuds, and grabbed a juicebox before walking out the door, exiting your apartment building, carelessly opening your juice, cursing under your breath as you got outside, realizing that you didn&rsquo;t have gloves. </p><p>The taste of apple juice was obnoxious, seeing as how the minty flavor of your toothpaste hadn&rsquo;t quite receded, but you didn&rsquo;t complain. You quickly threw the emptied box into the nearest trash can, before sticking your hands into your pockets, trying to warm them up as best as you could. You walked through the crowded streets of New York City, people walking past you as speedily as you were walking, nobody looking at the bustle around the neighborhood. Entering the train station, you sighed happily, your hands coming out of your pocket and reaching for your metro card, stuffed in your phone case, entering the bustling train station, glad to not have missed your train. </p><p>As the train came whistling into the stations, the windows whizzing past you, the inside of the train filled with hoards of people, as the train slowed down, finally halting. You walked about two feet towards the nearest doors, waiting for the obnoxious amount of people to pour out of the train, before being able to slowly enter, and to your disappointment, but expectance, having to stand up, close to the door you had entered on. </p><p>You looked at your phone, mindlessly going through the same few apps, waiting for your stop, the number of people on the train slowly dwindling down. About two stops before your school, there was finally enough breathing room, and you moved slightly back, glad to have the extra space. You closed your phone and placed it in your pocket, bobbing your head slightly to the music blaring in your ears. You closed your eyes, allowing yourself to be transported, dancing around slightly, not caring if people were watching you. You were only stopped when someone walked behind you, shoving you forward, yourself being rammed into another person.</p><p>You felt your cheeks flush slightly, noticed the rather short boy you had bumped into, no older than yourself, somewhat scrawny looking, but from what you had felt, was in no means scrawny. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; You told him, an awkward smile finding its way on your face as your embarrassment took over. &nbsp;</p><p>He offered you a warm smile, before pulling out one of his earbuds, yourself doing the same. &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; He asked, a little unaware and slightly confused.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; You repeated. You cleared your throat slightly, feeling the awkwardness inside of you take over. &ldquo;For bumping into you.&rdquo; You clarified, though it sounded more like an afterthought. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s really no problem.&rdquo; He replied, stuttering slightly, looking around the train car, feeling the awkwardness in himself come out as well. &ldquo;Besides, it probably wasn&rsquo;t even your fault.&rdquo; He cleared his throat, a slight rosiness appearing on his cheeks. &ldquo;One person gets shoved and everyone else does too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep, the domino effect.&rdquo; You blurted out, mentally cursing yourself at your choice of wording, even if it was accurate. <br /></p><p>The boy laughed slightly. &ldquo;It really is. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to take public transportation ever.&rdquo;</p><p>You laughed at that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure the whole city wishes they never had to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh god, can you imagine how much worse traffic would be if there was no metro?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It would be a complete nightmare. Honestly, like, if there was no metro I would have to wake up at freaking 4 in the morning to get to school on time.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Tell me about it. Walking to school everyday would be a nightmare.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Where do you go?&rdquo; You asked the boy, trying to see if you might recognize him. But then again, you may not; there were over 1000 students at your school, about 400 in your grade alone.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Midtown High. You?&rdquo; He asked, motioning slightly with his head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Same, dude.&rdquo; You say, the two of you exchanging a sly smile. &ldquo;(Y/F/N).&rdquo; You offered, with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, Peter Parker.&rdquo; He said back, his initial awkwardness seeming to return.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well, Parker. What grade are you in? I haven&rsquo;t ever seen you around.&rdquo; <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sophmore.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Same.&rdquo; You reply, nodding, your awkwardness slowly coming back. You&rsquo;re eyes lit up in realization, before looking back at Peter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Penis Parker!&rdquo; You blurted out, only to realize how awful that sounded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I just never met you, and I always here that douche, Flash, yell in the hallway, &lsquo;Penis Parker,&rsquo; so I swear I didn&rsquo;t know, oh my god, I&rsquo;m a walking human disaster, howhaveInotdiedyet?&rdquo; You said rapidly, trying your best to profusely apologize. <br /></p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s fine. I mean, at least I&rsquo;m not the girl who walks around in pajama shirts all the time.&rdquo; He said, throwing you a smug look, proud of the shade he had just thrown.<br /></p><p>You open your mouth indignantly, mock gasping, acting offended. &ldquo;Why I never.&rdquo; </p><p>The two of you burst into laughter, before talking the rest of the way to school, deciding to try to find each other in the library during your free periods. And if you didn&rsquo;t, at least you had each others snapchats. You walked into first period, confident that you had made a new friend.</p><p><i><b>peter parker fic that i think i remember where it was going (ned was gonna set y&rsquo;all up) (</b>last edited: late august, 2017<b>)</b></i></p><p>Groaning, you lifted your head up and glanced at the clock realizing you only had 10 minutes left till the first weekend of the school year. You groaned again, slamming your head back onto the desk, not even caring enough to use your arms as a pillow. 10 minutes felt like an eternity. It seemed miraculous that you had managed to survive the first week of school, although it would be more of a miracle if you survived the last 10 minutes of the unholiness of school. Time seemed to slow down as the anticipation of the weekend came, each second seeming to tick slower than the one before it. As time seemed to slow, you seemed to accelerate, your fingers tapping idly on the desk, your knee starting to bounce Your mind started racing about your weekend plans, the most prominent one to go home and take a nice long soak in the tub, then binge watch Parks and Rec or High School Musical, whichever you were feeling, with your most comfortable sweats and a tub of ice cream. </p><p>You yawned slightly, rubbing your eyes, trying to fight the sleep that was threatening to overtake you, before glancing at the clock again, seeing that you still had another seven minutes. You looked up at the ceiling, trying to contain your frustration, doing the best not to yell out, boredom taking its hold over you. You didn&rsquo;t even have your stuff to put away to distract you from the boredom, having put it away a few minutes ago. </p><p>You glanced at the clock again, not even a minute had passed and this time you could not suppress your groan of frustration. You shot a death glare at the only person who dared to look at you, only afterwards feeling bad for Ned. Slamming your head onto the table in frustration, you closed your eyes, feeling tempted to stab them. You felt a wad of paper hit your head from the side, and you turned to look at the perpetrator, sticking your tongue out at Michelle as she she you her drawing of you &ldquo;in crisis&rdquo;, too lazy to flip her off. &nbsp;</p><p>You grabbed your backpack from its place on the ground next to your chair and you set it on your lap, looking around the classroom to see that nobody else was paying attention, and the lack of caring on the teachers face. It was, after all, only the first week back and everyone was craving summer. </p><p>You opened your backpack, pulling out whatever book was in there, most likely one that you had already read. To your surprise and delight, you saw that you had forgotten to take out a Harry Potter book<i>, </i>so you opened it up and started from your favorite spot, chuckling to yourself silently at the antics of the characters. </p><p>Not only tree minutes after reading, you felt a piece of paper hit you, and you turned to glare back at Michelle, only to realize that this paper had letters written on it. You unfurled it, revealing the messy handwriting of the resident web-slinger, Peter Parker.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Wanna hang out with Ned and me!?!?&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></b></p><p>Smiling goofily, you grabbed your pen and scribbled, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>a peter maximoff film that i tried writing about a dream i had (</b>last edited: maybe february of 2018?? a little earlier<b>)(warning it makes no fucking sense,,,,,,,cause i was trying to recreate a dream)</b></i></p><p>You honestly had no idea how you had gotten into this situation. Sure, skiing was fun, and yeah, you wanted to spend some time with your friends, but it wasn&rsquo;t something on the top of your priorities. Honestly, looking back on it, it seemed like it was a dream, having no real recollection of why or how, or even when you guys had decided to go. All you knew was that you were more excited than you had originally anticipated. It was also great that you were actually really good at skiing, despite not having skied for a few years. <br /></p><p>Once the few of you had gotten to the small ski slope, you tucked your phone into your jacket, zipping up the pocket, difficultly slipping into the ski boots, silently cursing already at how tight they were. You were ready a few minutes before your friends, silently proud of your achievement, pulling out your phone to check the time, seeing that it was still relatively early. You smiled, glad to have the extra time to get a few runs in, putting on your skis and getting in line for the lift with one of your friends, chatting happily about nothing in particular. </p><p>Honestly, there should&rsquo;ve been something sketchy about the fact that there was a &ldquo;pick up a snowball and throw it while skiing&rdquo; challenge, but you really had no idea about why in the world you had decided that it would be a fun thing to do. And the fact that part of the challenge was based on not being tagged by too-gorgeous-to-be-human girls, made the challenge even weirder. Again, you had no idea how you had been roped into this. Maybe it was something that had to do with the fact that you seemed to have been standing in an active volcano range what felt like a few moments before? Probably. </p><p>Somehow, everyone else was failing, and honestly you had no idea how they possibly could&rsquo;ve been. It was so simple, and honestly you were ready to beat their asses. When it came to your turn, you felt the a</p><p><i><b>a gertchase x reader fic about sitting on the couch and loving your bf and gf (</b>last edited: january of 2018<b>)</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Dating is so heteronormative.&rdquo; Gert spoke, earning an amused eyeroll from you as you flipped the page of your book, not even bothering to look up knowing the playfully hurt look that would be on Chase&rsquo;s face, a hand over his heart in mock hurt.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Thanks babe.&rdquo; You had replied sarcastically, looking up only when you heard a gasp of over-exaggerated offense, reminding you of a shady grandma, snorting slightly as your mind produced the image of Chase wearing an apron and mary-jane shoes, a smirk making its way onto your face as you looked at him.</p><p>&ldquo;I happen to be heterosexual, and seem to be doing perfectly find. Punching would-be rapists, anyway.&rdquo; He listed off, his tone of voice being rather proud, but his face darkened at the mention of his old friends, his jaw tightening and his hands beginning to form fists.</p><p>You sighed slightly, bookmarking your page, moving your legs off the couch, scooching to the other side of it, draping an arm loosely around Chase&rsquo;s frame, your feet dangling slightly off the couch. </p><p>&ldquo;You happen to be the exception.&rdquo; Gert spoke, slightly understanding that the tone of the conversation had changed, trying to keep it light, in her own way.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; You had spoke, going back to reading, your fingers comfortably intertwined with Chase&rsquo;s, Chase patting the place on the floor next to him, encouraging Gert to sit down next to him.</p><p><b><i>the climax to the part of a </i><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/13700793/chapters/31469835\">jack thompson series</a></b><i><b> where i haven&rsquo;t even started the second chapter </b>(last edited: february of 2018</i>) <b>(warnings: graphic violence)</b></p><p>It started slowly. A gradual numbing sensation slowly crawling up your body, before it started ti burn, the flickering sensation of pain engaging your every nerve. The pain flickered, seeming to engulf your entire body, seeming almost suffocating as you tried to scream out in pain and desperation though your muscles would not allow you to move. Your entire body seemed to tighten, biting down harshly on your tongue to keep from crying out as your arm slowly raised, the higher your arm moved, the more your body seemed to burn, and you could almost feel your flesh begin to burn, a smell of singed flesh overwhelming you as your arm continued to move higher and higher, the weight in your hand feeling unnatural despite the constant weight of the item which you normally grasped so easily. Bile seemed to form in your mouth, feeling sweat form, your skin pricking at the feeling of uneasiness which settled in your stomach, time seeming to stand even more still as you did your best to avoid the blue eyes which stared back at you, the fear apparent seeming to pierce through you as you closed your eyes tightly, breathing shakily, before opening them, pulling the trigger instantly, the sound of a muffled gunshot, the body hitting the floor. You shut your eyes once more, feeling the uneasiness return as you stared at him, blood pouring from his body, spilling onto the floor.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><i><b>a flashback scene that i was initially gonna use in my prologue for <a href=\"https://fistigones.tumblr.com/post/171118704020/long-live-the-king-prologuepairing-erik\">long live the king</a>&nbsp;(</b>last edited: i think literally a year ago, today; february 23, 2018<b>)</b></i></p><p>&ldquo;This is pointless!&rdquo; He yelled angrily at his uncle, removing the mask from his face, panting heavily, the club in his hand as his cousin slightly nodded next to him, though far more subtle about his dislike for the intense sparring regiment.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It is not!&rdquo; Was the angry reply from T&rsquo;Chaka, articulating his statement with an slam of his spear, staring down his rather testy teenage nephew.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Was the angry reply from Erik, as he stepped closer to his uncle who, glaring at him angrily.</p><p>&ldquo;You are to be T&rsquo;Challa&rsquo;s right hand man when I am gone, meaning you must be able to protect yourself!&rdquo; He said, getting louder as he spoke, standing up to glare at his defiant nephew.</p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell do I have to defend myself?

You are all that matter.\u00a0</p><p>After the shower, and after you\u2019ve dressed, you drag him over to your bed and lay his head on your chest. Your hands work wonders on his back, massaging every tense muscle, every dip and curve.\u00a0</p><p>In retaliation, he lets out little noises - points for those.\u00a0</p><p>You have him wrapped around your little finger even if he\u2019s too weak to remain attached.\u00a0</p>",

And I am aware that the timing is off because the original character was attacked in college and I wrote them in high school, but I wanted to connect the story with Civil War too so I had to change a few things.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6d9d085071bdb9101679229b69c2ecd6/tumblr_inline_pcwwtv3xOm1vk51f7_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;Hello, stranger.&rdquo; You said with thick sarcasm when you got to the roof. He turned his head towards you to confirm your identity and a smile lit up his face before he stood up to show off his new suit. He was sitting on the corner edge of the roof before you got a good look at his improved suit, finding it hard to look away from the closefitting fabric. &ldquo;Is that why you ran off to Germany?&rdquo; You asked before seating down with him on the edge of the roof.&nbsp;</p><p>You sat facing him, the&nbsp;&lsquo;L&rsquo; shaped structure making your knees connect. He instinctively reached a hand behind you as you sat to make sure you were safe, his fingers gracing your lower back before you quickly inspected his physical state. He seemed to be developing a few bruises but the smile never left his face as he told the whole story of his encounter with the avengers with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>He told you about the limousine ride to the airport, his first plane trip, even explained in full detail the aspect of his hotel room over the foreign country. You just sat there listening attentively, chiming in every now and then; particularly when he explained his encounter with Ant-Man.</p><p>&ldquo;Like the AT AT&rsquo;s in Episode V?&rdquo; You has asked fast, as to not disturb his story.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He responded with euphoria as if you had taken the words right out of his mouth. You both started laughing together. After so many days of being apart, it was nice to finally come together again and share such intimate moments like these. His expression got serious before he spoke again.&nbsp;&ldquo;You know, if this thing goes my way, I can be working alongside him soon.&rdquo; He said with determination.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout your friendship, you both had made plans of finishing high school and go to college together, unable to see a future in which you weren&rsquo;t in each other&rsquo;s life; not one worth pursuing anyways. So your expression got serious when you heard him state his alternative plans.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; What about school?&rdquo; You asked regarding high school. If his wishes had changed and he no longer wanted to go to college with you, you&rsquo;d accept that as a good friend would.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, missing a few days to go overseas sounds like fun and all, but you <i>do</i> plan on finishing, right?&rdquo; You asked concerned. He took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;&rdquo; He begun.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen my fair share of bad things&hellip; If I had these abilities then, I could have made sure you didn&rsquo;t had to see some of them.&rdquo; He stated, visibly guilty for not being able to save you then. He had never really spoken about what had happened but you could tell he was hurt. Because he couldn&rsquo;t save you. And no one else did. And it broke him to even begin to think about you being victimized. The name left Peter&rsquo;s lips with such hatred that it clouded his eyes in a way that you&rsquo;ve never seen before. &ldquo;I wanna make sure people like Ryan don&rsquo;t hurt anyone else&hellip; So you can say I&rsquo;m <i>way</i> beyond high school at this point.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The name felt like a slap to the face but the tension building up in your shoulders and the cloud taking over your eyes dissipated at the touch of Peter&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Then and there, you understood that it would be selfish for you to make him stay. Because everyone deserved to feel this safe. And everyone deserved a chance to be saved.&nbsp;</p><p>_____</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjODeju786UG9mCRpAMNAhg\" target=\"_blank\">@lokilvrr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mRjKQ1uxyadfQGEzL_jMx-A\" target=\"_blank\">@musiclover1263</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOFtz5u4dZwFz7_3-lcI7og\" target=\"_blank\">@butwhyduh</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGSpUi4zfDveVRNNcGXKH9A\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandlovely</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1x5AT9H4d_35xPvDVhsFkg\" target=\"_blank\">@madmadmilk</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHJxDJ7yvssva01soBsz5ag\" target=\"_blank\">@gottaletgopete</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mpp9hoSQ6NgIa6QiFdslZ8Q\" target=\"_blank\">@whyistomholland</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m45SZ7yG1yR3gRhY26Qom1Q\" target=\"_blank\">@grandmascottlang</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEsnslz1vUv5_Kh5P2sI3Pg\" target=\"_blank\">@spiderboytotherescue</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSAK1zU4nvNlaA6QxDFk1cA\" target=\"_blank\">@yourtomwritings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myBs4ORzTGp8K7aZp9uxeSw\" target=\"_blank\">@spideymood</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m2iMVfkjI5t3xmWyhPVi1IA\" target=\"_blank\">@peterplanet</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgJSIOU84qU1v2O3QIuFAkA\" target=\"_blank\">@zophora</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mic2rcB3iST2sqhciJJo43A\" target=\"_blank\">@bi-writes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mTXfmW3fhiOa0cs6qCKBKig\" target=\"_blank\">@hollandbaby</a><br /></p>",

Would you do something with Peter Parker where the reader is still studying to be a nurse and suddenly one day in the middle of the the night Peter goes to her room in his Spiderman suit begging for help because he's terribly injured but he haven't tell her yet about being Spiderman so she starts to freak out because he's bleeding a lot and also due to the fact that he didn't tell her his secret and starts to cry while cleaning his wounds?",

I need full access to you.\u201d You mutter, listening to him groan as he strips of it. Meanwhile, you grab the needle and sutures from your nursing kit the program provided you before hurrying to the bathroom and getting the alcohol and cotton pads as well as the box of bandages under the sink. Looking at yourself in the mirror, you brush the beads of tears rolling down your nose away and find him again. </p><p>Clicking open the alcohol, you crouch beside him, pulling a cotton pad out and sniffing back your tears. Dampening the pad in alcohol, you raise your head, finding the first small gash near his hipbone. You look to his face, his eyes closed, </p><p>\u201cKeep still.\u201d You murmur, waiting until he nods to drag it across the flared ends of his skin. He hisses, but holds still, his abdomen contracting in pain. You clean it and sew it up, minding the tears slipping down your face. His breathing is ragged from the cuts littering his face and body. </p><p>You repeat the process until you get to the bad slash, pressing down on it to stop the bleeding. He wheezes but allows you to do it, his eyes squeezing shut tightly. </p><p>\u201cGod damn.\u201d He groans, holding your hip tight in his hand as you crouch over him, hands crimson in his blood. He grunts, but his blood eventually stops leaking from the wound. You draw back, wiping your hands off on a towel but his hand reaches up to brush a tear away, </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this\u2026 huh?\u201d You sniffle,</p><p>\u201cIts nothing.\u201d You can hear the wheeze in his voice,</p><p>\u201cYeah? You always cry for nothing?\u201d Brushing a fresh cotton pad across his skin, he hisses again, his eyes squeezing shut again before he opens them, </p><p>\u201cI am sorry.

Walking back to him, you hand two to him, </p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He mutters, slipping them into his mouth and swallowing them down with water. You open the box of bandages, finding the handful of big ones to cover his stitches with,</p><p>\u201cI have for a while but\u2026 now that I\u2019ve screwed everything up\u2026 you should know that.\u201d He watches you bandage him before cleaning up the area,</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t screw anything up Peter.

It\u2019s a lot.\u201d He nods, </p><p>\u201cI know\u2026 I know.\u201d Folding your arms across your chest, he sighs and holds his own up, </p><p>\u201cC'mere.\u201d Walking forward, he rubs your back as you climb in beside him, laying your head over his shoulder. He reaches up to play with your hair, </p><p>\u201cIs there any way you can forgive me?\u201d You nod, running your finger over his pec, just beside his nipple,</p><p>\u201cYou got me some practice in the stitch district.
