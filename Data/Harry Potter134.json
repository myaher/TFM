Because if you&rsquo;re saying I should give you another chance&hellip; the whole reason I asked if I could think about my answer was so I could see what your intentions were and they clearly weren&rsquo;t good.\u201d I turn to walk back into the common room and I feel him roughly pull my upper arm.\u00a0\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>Sirius\u2019s POV</p><p>She was leaving, I had to think of something quick, so, I kissed her. She was shocked but eventually, she kissed me back. She wrapped her arms around my waist, and while mine stayed on her face (A/n See GIF for reference) For a moment I felt like everything would be okay but I know after this I\u2019m going to have to work my ass off for her to forgive me but for her it\u2019ll be worth it all.</p><p>Y/N\u2019s POV</p><p>We pulled away from the kiss slowly, I didn\u2019t want it to end.

Well&hellip; at least for now&rdquo; James smirked &ldquo;Oh whatever, come on Remus&rdquo; I huffed and stood up, walking towards the portrait &ldquo;We have to be quiet, I don&rsquo;t want to ruin a possible moment they&rsquo;re having&rdquo; I whisper. &ldquo;Love, you should know by now that I&rsquo;m great at being sneaky&rdquo; James winked &ldquo;Call me Love again and I\u2019ll make sure you won&rsquo;t be able to move for a week&rdquo; I threated &ldquo;Wow, no need to get violent Lily flower&rdquo; I rolled my eyes, reaching to open the portrait &ldquo;Just be quite the both of you&rdquo; Remus scolded. I opened the portrait slowly, trying to make the least amount of noise possible, I made sure it was open wide enough so everyone could see. &ldquo;Oh my god, that is the cutest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo; James swooned. Sirius and Y/N were just standing in the corridor hugging, I felt weird on intruding on an intimate moment like this but I was just so happy for my best friend.</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s POV</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re watching us&rdquo; Sirius whispered, &ldquo;I know, they aren\u2019t very secretive are they?&rdquo; We could both hear them giggling from the portrait. &ldquo;Just ignore them&rdquo; he purred while pulling me closer. I finally felt happy, &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m never letting you go. You&rsquo;re stuck with me forever now.&rdquo; he teased &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; I smiled.</p><p>A/n: Hey!

I can still feel the tears running down my face and I can still hear Sirius&rsquo;s pleas for me to come back ringing in my ears. I give the password to the fat lady and try and&nbsp;rush&nbsp;myself up the stairs towards my dorm, clearly not wanting to talk to anyone, unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t stop James Potter. I feel him grab my wrist and lightly pull me of the steps and towards him. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He looks at me with sympathy &ldquo;come sit down with us&rdquo; he refers to Lupin and Pettigrew. I hesitate, what if Sirius comes back? I don&rsquo;t even know them that well, why would they want to comfort me?</p>\n</p>",

        "question": "\"You took my son to get his tongue pierced?!\" -Draco \ud83d\ude03 Congratualtions!",
        "answer": "<p>Ever since they had started dating, Harry\u2019s son and Scorpius Malfoy were even more inseparable than before. Barely a day went past when they weren\u2019t either Flooing to each other\u2019s house or asking when they could next Floo to each other\u2019s house. Harry didn\u2019t mind Scorpius Malfoy being around so much more - he was polite and friendly and he made Albus so happy - but interacting with Draco so much more took a bit of getting used to. </p><p>Harry was always hyper aware of ensuring Scorpius\u2019 safety and wellbeing when he was under the Potter roof. Draco would have his head if anything were to happen to his precious son while he was under Harry\u2019s care. But seeing as the boys liked it best when they were simply in Albus\u2019 room, or in the garden, Harry didn\u2019t have much to worry about. </p><p>Towards the end of the summer, Harry agreed to take Albus and Lily school shopping and Albus had immediately asked if Scorpius could come with them. Harry wasn\u2019t sure Draco would be okay with that, whether he\u2019d want to take Scorpius school shopping himself, but he\u2019d written a letter all the same.</p><p>Draco\u2019s short reply had been a slightly disparaging comment about how he\u2019d <i>already been organised enough to take his son shopping for school supplies</i> but that Scorpius would love to accompany them nonetheless and thanking Harry and Albus for the invitation. They\u2019d Flooed into the Leaky Cauldron to find an excited Scorpius and a bemused Draco, who sent Scorpius off with a brief hug, promising to pick him up later. </p><p>That had been several hours ago and Harry was now in a cafe with his daughter, a large coffee and an enormous slab of Victoria sponge he could have sworn he was going to say no to. Lily nibbled at the cake, sipped the Frappuccino she\u2019d ordered and chattered away. His school essentials purchased, Albus had long since shaken him off and was somewhere in the alley with Scorpius and strict instructions to stay there. </p><p>It had been a very successful morning. Albus had only needed new robes and a couple of new books for his NEWT subjects; Harry gave him some gold to top up his own potions kit, knowing they\u2019d be in the Apothecary for hours otherwise. Lily had asked no less than seventeen times for another pygmy puff and had spent almost half an hour choosing some new hair accessories which coordinated with her Hogwarts robes but didn\u2019t clash with her hair. </p><p>Harry\u2019s serene bubble of success was burst when an irate looking Draco Malfoy appeared in the coffee shop, bypassed the counter and took about three strides to approach Harry, his expression furious. </p><p>\u201cPotter, what did you <i>do</i>?\u201d </p><p>Lily snorted into her slice of cake and Harry threw her a warning look. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry gestured to the spare chair at their table but Draco did not sit down.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where our sons have been?\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>Harry was confused. Was Draco annoyed at him for letting Albus and Scorpius off on their own? Scorpius was only months away from turning seventeen and it wasn\u2019t like they were off gallivanting around muggle London together, the alley was very safe. But Harry was suddenly worried he\u2019d misjudged the situation and that Draco would never have let Scorpius leave by himself. </p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Draco, but they were getting bored of me hanging around and where they\u2019re both almost of age, I thought it would be okay if-\u201c Harry stopped. \u201cHang on, what are you doing here anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to have tasks to complete here,\u201d Draco said cryptically. \u201cI saw Scorpius and Albus as I was passing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDraco, it\u2019s very safe here, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, Potter, that\u2019s not where my concern lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does your concern lie?\u201d Harry asked warily. </p><p>\u201cI have just seen Scorpius and your son leaving a <i>tattoo shop</i>.\u201d He left a dramatic pause.</p><p>Lily gasped gleefully. \u201cOoh is Albus getting a tattoo?

He hasn\u2019t,\u201d Harry insisted. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Scorpius has, then,\u201d Lily said off handedly and Draco turned pink. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, Scorpius has not\u2026\u201d Draco muttered to himself reassuringly, striding along the cobbled street determinedly. </p><p>Draco was on such a mission that he didn\u2019t notice Albus sat outside Florean Fortescue\u2019s giving them a cheery wave. </p><p>\u201cOh hi, Dad, Lil.

Probably not friend anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou took my son to get his tongue pierced?!\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t clear whether the question was aimed at Harry or Albus, but as Albus was his son, Harry felt told off either way. </p><p>\u201cWhy did\u2026 how\u2026 how did that happen?\u201d Harry was willing Albus with his eyes not to say he\u2019d talked Scorpius into it. </p><p>Albus shrugged again, the epitome of nonchalance. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted it done for ages.\u201d  </p><p>Draco spluttered in protest. \u201cHe\u2019s never expressed <i>any</i> desire to do <i>that</i> before!\u201d </p><p>At that moment, Scorpius emerged from the shop with a milkshake in each hand. He set them down at the table with a cheerful grin, which quickly turned to mild confusion when he spotted his dad\u2019s expression. Harry wondered if Scorpius had deliberately waited for today to go off and do this without his dad being able to stop him. </p><p>\u201cHi, Dad. What are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>Scorpius looked breezy and casual, no trace of guilt or suspicion on his face. Harry watched his tongue as he talked, looking for the flash of silver. </p><p>\u201cScorpius,\u201d Draco spluttered again, apparently unable to say anything else. </p><p>Scorpius glanced at Albus who looked blank then at Lily, who was gazing at Scorpius in impressed admiration.

He was gaping a bit in confusion and, almost immediately, it was clearly visible that he didn\u2019t have a tongue piercing. </p><p>It was then that he realised that - while he was appraising Scorpius - Draco was watching Albus. Albus, who was now sipping his milkshake with a poorly concealed grin on his face, as if he were about to burst out laughing. Because Scorpius hadn\u2019t pierced his tongue at all. </p><p>Harry looked from his son to his old rival, something passing between them which he wasn\u2019t fully reading.

Was Draco annoyed at him for letting Albus and Scorpius off on their own?

Was Draco annoyed at him for letting Albus and Scorpius off on their own? Scorpius was only months away from turning seventeen and it wasn\u2019t like they were off gallivanting around muggle London together, the alley was very safe. But Harry was suddenly worried he\u2019d misjudged the situation and that Draco would never have let Scorpius leave by himself. </p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, Draco, but they were getting bored of me hanging around and where they\u2019re both almost of age, I thought it would be okay if-\u201c Harry stopped. \u201cHang on, what are you doing here anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to have tasks to complete here,\u201d Draco said cryptically. \u201cI saw Scorpius and Albus as I was passing.\u201d </p><p>\u201cDraco, it\u2019s very safe here, and-\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, Potter, that\u2019s not where my concern lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does your concern lie?\u201d Harry asked warily. </p><p>\u201cI have just seen Scorpius and your son leaving a <i>tattoo shop</i>.\u201d He left a dramatic pause.</p><p>Lily gasped gleefully. \u201cOoh is Albus getting a tattoo? Can I get one, Dad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry stared at Draco in confusion. \u201cAlbus wouldn\u2019t have got a tattoo, would he, Lil?\u201d</p><p>Lily shrugged and ate some more cake. </p><p>\u201cMaybe it would be wise to check what they\u2019re up to?\u201d Draco gestured for them to leave and Harry looked at Lily.</p><p>\u201cI want to see!\u201d she cried enthusiastically. </p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be anything to see, Albus hasn\u2019t got a tattoo. He hasn\u2019t,\u201d Harry insisted. </p><p>\u201cMaybe Scorpius has, then,\u201d Lily said off handedly and Draco turned pink. </p><p>\u201cNo, no, Scorpius has not\u2026\u201d Draco muttered to himself reassuringly, striding along the cobbled street determinedly. </p><p>Draco was on such a mission that he didn\u2019t notice Albus sat outside Florean Fortescue\u2019s giving them a cheery wave. </p><p>\u201cOh hi, Dad, Lil. Hello, Mr Malfoy.\u201d He smiled innocently while all three of them scrutinised him for evidence of a tattoo. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked in concern after a second, playing with his hair like there might be something wrong with it and that\u2019s what they were all staring at. </p><p>\u201cEr, what have you been up to?\u201d Harry asked jovially.</p><p>Albus shrugged. \u201cBeen here and there, now we\u2019re getting milkshakes.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHere and there\u2026\u201d Draco muttered. </p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry cleared his throat, \u201cDraco seems to think he saw you and Scorpius leaving a tattoo parlour.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat tattoo did you get, Al?\u201d Lily cried happily, joining him at the small table. \u201cShow me! Or was it Scorpius?\u201d She got up on her knees to try and look inside the ice cream shop.</p><p>Albus laughed. \u201cNobody got a tattoo.\u201d </p><p>Harry relaxed and he saw Draco\u2019s tense shoulders release slightly. </p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in that shop then?\u201d </p><p>Albus shrugged. \u201cScor got his tongue pierced.\u201d </p><p>Harry felt his stomach drop, his heart stop and his face redden. Draco would never, ever forgive him for this. Harry chanced a glance over at his old school enemy, now sort of friend. Probably not friend anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou took my son to get his tongue pierced?!\u201d </p><p>It wasn\u2019t clear whether the question was aimed at Harry or Albus, but as Albus was his son, Harry felt told off either way. </p><p>\u201cWhy did\u2026 how\u2026 how did that happen?\u201d Harry was willing Albus with his eyes not to say he\u2019d talked Scorpius into it. </p><p>Albus shrugged again, the epitome of nonchalance. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted it done for ages.\u201d  </p><p>Draco spluttered in protest. \u201cHe\u2019s never expressed <i>any</i> desire to do <i>that</i> before!\u201d </p><p>At that moment, Scorpius emerged from the shop with a milkshake in each hand. He set them down at the table with a cheerful grin, which quickly turned to mild confusion when he spotted his dad\u2019s expression. Harry wondered if Scorpius had deliberately waited for today to go off and do this without his dad being able to stop him. </p><p>\u201cHi, Dad. What are you doing here?\u201d </p><p>Scorpius looked breezy and casual, no trace of guilt or suspicion on his face. Harry watched his tongue as he talked, looking for the flash of silver. </p><p>\u201cScorpius,\u201d Draco spluttered again, apparently unable to say anything else. </p><p>Scorpius glanced at Albus who looked blank then at Lily, who was gazing at Scorpius in impressed admiration. Harry hoped she wasn\u2019t getting any ideas. </p><p>\u201cAlbus told your dad what you did,\u201d Harry said when it didn\u2019t look like anybody was going to say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2026 did?\u201d Scorpius looked anguished, as if he were trying to work out what he\u2019d done wrong. He was gaping a bit in confusion and, almost immediately, it was clearly visible that he didn\u2019t have a tongue piercing. </p><p>It was then that he realised that - while he was appraising Scorpius - Draco was watching Albus. Albus, who was now sipping his milkshake with a poorly concealed grin on his face, as if he were about to burst out laughing. Because Scorpius hadn\u2019t pierced his tongue at all. </p><p>Harry looked from his son to his old rival, something passing between them which he wasn\u2019t fully reading. Draco raised his eyebrows, then smirked, just with the corner of his mouth. Albus winked at him and the two gave almost identical snorts of laughter. </p><p>\u201cCan someone explain to me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Lily said in a loud, bored voice.</p><p>\u201cI think maybe it\u2019s a Slytherin thing,\u201d Harry commented, grinning at Albus.</p><p>Scorpius cleared his throat. \u201cHello, yes, um, I\u2019m a Slytherin too and I\u2019m also a bit lost.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhy were you in a tattoo shop then?\u201d Draco asked Albus.</p><p>\u201cSeeing how much it would cost to get my ears pierced, can\u2019t go on my own until I\u2019m seventeen anyway.\u201d Albus fiddled with his ear lobe experimentally. \u201cCan I do it, Dad?\u201d </p><p>\u201cEr, let\u2019s discuss it at home with your mum,\u201d Harry said non-commitally. </p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019d say that,\u201d Albus said quietly to Scorpius. </p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell my dad I did?\u201d Scorpius was still stuck in mild confusion. \u201cDad?\u201d He turned to Draco. </p><p>\u201cYou knew I\u2019d say that?\u201d Harry pressed Albus. \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Scorpius. Just Albus\u2019 idea of a hilarious joke.\u201d Draco spoke at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSo Scorpius didn\u2019t get his tongue pierced? Dad, can <i>I</i> get my tongue pierced?\u201d Lily interrupted. </p><p>Scorpius\u2019 face was a picture as it dawned on him what Albus had said. </p><p><b>\ud83c\udf891k celebration drabbles\ud83c\udf89</b></p>",

        "body": "<h2><b>James</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: Some kind of Asian. Common headcanon is that he\u2019s Indian, so let\u2019s go with that.<br/><b>Sexuality</b>: Straight, and very surprised to find out that none of the other Marauders are\u00a0<br/><b>Ship(s)</b>: Lily.\u00a0<br/>If I should ship him with someone else, it would probably be an OC.<br/>In an AU where he was into guys, I could see him with Sirius, too.<br/><b>Nope ship(s)</b>: Haven\u2019t really seen him paired up with anyone but Lily, tbh&hellip; but any ship with a large age gap. I\u2019m not very fond of James/Snape either.<br/><b>Platonic ship(s): </b>The Marauders. I like to think he was close to Frank, Alice, Kingsley, Moody, Marlene McKinnon, Mary MacDougal etc. too.<br/><b>Disability/ies</b>: From what we see of him, he could have ADHD. Idk tho.<br/></p><h2><b>Lily</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: Isn\u2019t she explicitly described as\u00a0\u201cpale and rosecheeked\u201d or something like that? Yeah, pretty sure she\u2019s white (also, Petunia is blonde and blue-eyed, so yeah)<br/><b>Sexuality</b>: Demiromantic bisexual. She can easily find people attractive, but she doesn\u2019t develop romantic feelings before a few years at least<br/><b>Ship(s): </b>James.<br/>In an AU where he stayed a spoiled brat and she wouldn\u2019t want to date him, I could see her with either Remus or one of her female friends.<br/><b>Nope ship(s): </b>Believe it or not, I have seen people ship her with Slughorn (!)<br/>I really don\u2019t ship Snily. It wouldn\u2019t be good for any of them. I don\u2019t think I have to explain why, as we see that even their friendship wasn\u2019t completely healthy.<br/><b>Platonic ship(s)</b>: I think she was close to the other Marauders, as well as her female friends (and of course Kingsley, Moody etc.)<br/>In an AU where Snape didn\u2019t hang out with people who wanted Lily dead, I think they could have had a beautiful friendship. But well&hellip;<br/><b>Disability/ies</b>: None that I can think of&hellip;</p><h2><b>Sirius</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: Mixed. I think he has some white, and some Asian (perhaps Filipino or Sri Lankan) and maybe some Hispanic, too. Idk.<br/><b>Sexuality</b>: Asexual homoromantic.\u00a0<br/><b>Ship(s)</b>: Remus.

But well&hellip;<br /><b>Disability/ies</b>: None that I can think of&hellip;</p><h2><b>Sirius</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: Mixed. I think he has some white, and some Asian (perhaps Filipino or Sri Lankan) and maybe some Hispanic, too. Idk.<br /><b>Sexuality</b>: Asexual homoromantic.&nbsp;<br /><b>Ship(s)</b>: Remus. In an AU where they both survive, ofc. And perhaps they dated a little in their Hogwarts years, before all that war stuff distracted them. Idk.&nbsp;<br />In an AU where James was into guys, I could see them dating, too.<br />Another ship I&rsquo;d love to explore is Sirius/Kingsley. (Kingsley is into guys, right? Let&rsquo;s say he is.) I think it&rsquo;d be fun to have the slightly immature rebellious guy and the ambitious, serious guy&hellip; just&hellip; date each other. Yeah.<br />A crack ship I could sort of see is Sirius/Lucius. I mean&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it be hilarious?<br /><b>Nope ship(s)</b>: I have, of course, seen him paired up with most of the Lightning Generation (yes, including Draco and Neville. Yikes) and that&rsquo;s just&hellip; too big of an age gap, especially since most of them were minors when he died.<br />I&rsquo;ve also seen him paired up with Regulus and all of the Black Sisters, which is just&hellip; plain wrong!<br />I don&rsquo;t like Sirius/Snape that much either.<br /><b>Platonic ship(s): </b>All of da Marauders (if he isn&rsquo;t dating any of them, that is). And of course Lily and the rest of the friend group.<br /><b>Disability/ies</b>: Isn&rsquo;t it pretty obvious that he has depression and probably PTSD after Azkaban? He didn&rsquo;t really seem all that normal in his youth either &ndash; werewolf prank, anyone? But considering the parents he grew up with, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that he would be a bit fucked up, even if he didn&rsquo;t realise it.</p><h2><b>Remus</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: White<br /><b>Sexuality</b>: Either bi or pan. You know what, I think he&rsquo;s pan.<br />And he&rsquo;s also a trans boy. He realised he was a dude a while after he was bitten, and that&rsquo;s why he chose that name.<br /><b>Ship(s)</b>: I do like him with Tonks.<br />But I also kinda ship him with Sirius.<br />I could also see him with Lily, if she didn&rsquo;t date James.<br /><b>Nope ship(s)</b>: Any ship with a large age difference, tbh.&nbsp;<br />(Tonks is on thin fucking ice, but the fact that she was was into her twenties when they started dating, and that their relationship arc is so freaking cute, makes the ice a bit thicker)<br />Oh, and especially Greyback! Why do some people ship this?<br /><b>Platonic ship(s)</b>: Marauders! (if he doesn&rsquo;t date Sirius, then they&rsquo;re brotp)<br />And the rest of the friend group, like I described above<br /><b>Disability/ies</b>: He seems to have some sort of social anxiety?<br />And definitely depression. He needed to take some meds!</p><h2><b>Peter</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: White<br /><b>Sexuality: </b>Gay mess. Probably had a big crush on James and Sirius during their school time. (i have a crack headcanon that he switched side because he thought young!TomRiddle was hotter than his friends)<br /><b>Ship(s)</b>: Idk&hellip; can&rsquo;t really see him with anyone, tbh. Perhaps an oc? Someone who could boost his morality and confidence. Kinda like Ginny, but male and from his generation.<br /><b>Nope ship(s)</b>: Anything p&aelig;do. Don&rsquo;t really ship him with death eaters, either.&nbsp;<br /><b>Platonic ship(s)</b>: The Marauders and Lily, Kingsley etc. before he betrayed them. But well&hellip;<br /><b>Disability/ies</b>: Perhaps some kind of anxiety?</p><h2><b>Snape</b></h2><p><b>Race</b>: He reads as a mixed dude to me. Probably some white, perhaps also some Asian. Maybe he has descendants from multiple Asian countries? I like the idea of him having some Korean and Middle Eastern. Yeah.<br /><b>Sexuality</b>: It&rsquo;s common to headcanon him as ace. I don&rsquo;t see why he couldn&rsquo;t be, so let&rsquo;s just say he is.<br />I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s into guys, so heteroromantic?<br />I&rsquo;ve also seen people headcanon him as Not Cis. But whether he&rsquo;s a trans boy, non-binary, intersex, or something completely different? Idk. I do like the idea of him being intersex and non-binary, but alright with he/him pronouns (whether that would make him a non-binary and/or he/him lesbian&hellip; i won&rsquo;t go into that, since i&rsquo;m not lesbian myself)<br /><b>Ship(s)</b>: If I should pick a canon character, I&rsquo;d pick Narcissa. That unbreakable vow chapter made me realise how cute they&rsquo;d be together, and after a reread/rewatch, you realise that they were both primarily driven (and arguably redeemed) by love.<br />If not, then probably an oc of some kind.&nbsp;<br /><b>Nope ship(s)</b>: So many&hellip; but first: any p&aelig;do ship. It&rsquo;s common to ship him with Harry and Hermione, both of which are very wrong (especially the Snarry ship, but since the Snamione ship has sexist undertones&hellip;) And Dumbledore and Voldemort (I&rsquo;ve seen fanart for both&hellip; I wish I hadn&rsquo;t)<br />But also Lily (for aforementioned reasons) and James and Sirius.<br /><b>Platonic ship(s)</b>: Lily, if he could stop that racism before it was too late.<br />And I like the idea of him and Luna sort of befriending each other, as long as he stops being mean to Neville (bc she wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate that bullshit)<br /><b>Disability/ies</b>: Um, depression? Definitely.<br />He does seem to have some Autistic traits, too. His intovercy/introvertiness/whatever and his deep interest in stuff. Also how he can sometimes act slightly&hellip; clingy towards Lily (I&rsquo;m autistic, and I tend to be pretty clingy in periods where I only have one friend)</p></p>",

Mas foi legal ter todos os meus amigos ao meu redor e saber que eu tinha esse grupo de suporte&rdquo;</em>, disse ela.</p>\n<p>A escala&ccedil;&atilde;o de Datar, que nasceu na &Iacute;ndia, segue a tradi&ccedil;&atilde;o estabelecida em Londres de promover a diversidade na escala&ccedil;&atilde;o para os pap&eacute;is de Rose e Hermione. <em>&ldquo;Quando soube sobre isso [audi&ccedil;&atilde;o para a pe&ccedil;a], eu pensei &lsquo;Isso &eacute; algo que eu amaria assistir&rsquo;, ter algu&eacute;m da minha idade, ou garotas mais novas, indo ao teatro e se vendo representada no palco&rdquo;</em>, ela diz. <em>&ldquo;Me sinto grata por ter a oportunidade de estar em um show que seja t&atilde;o inovador&rdquo;.</em></p>\n<p><em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> estr&eacute;ia no Princess Theatre, em Melbourne na Austr&aacute;lia em 23 de fevereiro de 2019 com previews a partir de 18 de janeiro.

He smiled to himself absent-mindedly.</p><p>Both of you are 16 now, and he thought you should- no, you need to know about his 'furry little problem&rsquo;, as James had called it. But it had took him so long to pluck up the courage to tell you about it because he was scared. He was scared of losing you. And after a while of thinking, he knows that it was for the best. If he were to keep it much longer, and when you find out - by the time he had fallen more in love with you - you would abandon him. And he loved you to much for that.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Remus. Why do you look so nervous?&rdquo; you suddenly greeted him, making him jump a little. You chuckled at his nervousness.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, (y/n). I&hellip;&rdquo; he paused, not being able to continue. he looked at you directly in the eyes. You noticed that his eyes are now pooled with tears. &ldquo;I have something so important to tell you.&rdquo; tears started to stream down his face. Remus was never one to cry in front of people.</p><p>You looked at him, feeling extremely worried. &ldquo;Yeah? What is it?&rdquo; you said softly, wiping away his tears. You took his hand into yours, putting it to your chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. You can tell me anything.&rdquo; Remus smiled weakly at that, as if your words are giving him strenght to continue. </p><p><b><i>i don&rsquo;t think my love will ever start to fade away</i></b></p><p>&ldquo;Please, (y/n), don&rsquo;t be mad at me for not telling you this from the start?&rdquo; you nodded, caressing his cheeks, calming him down a little. Taking a deep breath, he started, &ldquo;I love you, (y/n). I really do. I love you so fucking much it hurts to tell you this. Please don&rsquo;t hate me after I tell you this, but I- I am a Werewolf, (y/n).&rdquo; his voice broke at that last sentence, as well as his heart.</p><p>You looked at him, eyes wide. Unlike what Remus had thought, you didn&rsquo;t let go of his hand, instead bringing him into your arms. &ldquo;Remus&hellip;&rdquo; you hugged him tightly, tears now streaming down your face as well, wetting Remus&rsquo; jumper. &ldquo;I can never hate you, Remus. For everything you&rsquo;ve done for me? It&rsquo;s ridiculous to hate you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But (y/n),&rdquo; Remus pulled away, a sad smile was plastered on his face, he continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a monster. <i>I&rsquo;m not a person who you should fall in love with. </i>Not anymore.&rdquo;</p><p><span style=\"color: #444444\"><b><i>my attachment to you isn&rsquo;t subject to change</i></b></span></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Do you know how it feels when the person you love the most tells you that you shouldn&rsquo;t love them?</i>&rdquo; you asked him, suddenly feeling angry.
