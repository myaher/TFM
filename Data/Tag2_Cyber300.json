I bounced this off a transphobic joke made by the game\u2019s twitter just as a sort of starting point.</p><p>Now needless to say, these were pretty early observations on what \u2018could\u2019 be happening, I didn\u2019t believe anything would be quite indicative of the final product and in fact, upon seeing the gameplay footage my hope and interest in Cyberpunk 2077 are very much improved and my understanding of the game has changed. This happened after seeing a particular scene referenced by one of the interviews I mention above after which I now find that the interpretation to be read from that scene is very very different to the interpretation of the scene provided in the interview. As such my outlook is has changed.</p><p>However, it soon became pretty clear that people weren\u2019t able to recognise the nuance of critique or observation and took my post pretty far. I am still getting, even now, a great deal of comments and asks full of vitriol and rage from people offended that someone might have an opinion on something. They began to accuse me of being overly offended, or even outraged at the game, where it should have been clear I was only somewhat wary, addressing potential issues that weren\u2019t even definite. At worst I got messages referring to me by a wide number of violent homophobic, transphobic, and even racist/antisemitic slurs (despite their being no indication I\u2019m even Jewish..?)</p><p>Now, this outrage over my post was clearly blown way out of proportion, (though that\u2019s no surprise considering some of them seemed largely offended by me just being trans or something,) and was not at all an understandable reaction. But amongst all of these comments I got some that largely confused me that essentially went like this:</p><p>\u201cHah, get wrekt sjw cuck, I\u2019m just more likely to buy this game now along with Doom: Eternal and Red Dead 2 knowing that these all trigger you lol!!\u201d</p><p>Now, despite how immature and reactionary these comments are they confused me\u2026 because I\u2019ve seen absolutely no outrage over Doom or Red Dead from leftist communities. I really should have had they existed, I\u2019m pretty leftist. Turns out, the outrage doesn\u2019t exist. It simply isn\u2019t there. It was constructed out of nothing so that reactionary conservatives can continue to create this idea of the 'SJW\u2019 enemy or something for them to get angry and (rather ironically) offended about.</p><p>Thanks to Shaun\u2019s video above I had this cleared up for me. In fact, it\u2019s funny to see that my interpretation of the modern Doom franchise is clear to others as well, of a franchise that\u2019s actually fairly anti-corporation/-capitalist in it\u2019s message and critique, as it\u2019s looking Cyberpunk 2077 actually will be too. Funnily enough, that\u2019s a fairly leftist position. Hope y'all racists and reactionaries who buy that game can stomach that lol.</p><p>Makes me think of all the other series that are predominantly progressive or left-leaning in message: Dead Space, Wolfenstein, Battlefield and Call of Duty sometimes, Alien: Isolation, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us, Uncharted, and even Crash Bandicoot, Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex, and so many more that I can\u2019t list off the top of my head\u2026.</p></p>",

That being said, sonofabitch what a way to present your game. I\u2019m going to gloss over my favorite parts and things I noticed because honestly, a play by play won\u2019t do it justice. Please go watch it.</p><p><b>MadWorld</b> (or \u201cCity\u201d in this case)</p><p>I don\u2019t need the sprawling landscapes and varied vistas of The Witcher 3. CDPR did an incredible job making every acre feel lived in. The landscape of Night City allows them to hone the focus of detail on a singular city. The touch of every NPCs class or sect hanging over their heads is nice, but I look forward to turning that option off and just enjoying the crowded streets for what they are. Gorgeous. The level of detail presented was just staggering, I couldn\u2019t look at one thing for too long or I\u2019d miss something. The lighting is sharp and accentuates how the world sits between impoverished dirty and futuristic shine. Even the\u00a0\u2018natural\u2019 lighting in the apartment gunfight really cuts through and actually is worth noticing when LEDs and neon lights are almost all we get down on street level.
