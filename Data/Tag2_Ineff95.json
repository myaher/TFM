                "content": "<p><p><small><i><a href=\"http://apictureofspace.tumblr.com/post/183336244786/endless-list-of-good-omens-aus-4-anthony-j\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson &amp; Obscene</a></i> (or <i>The Obligatory Bright Young Things AU</i>)</small></p><blockquote><p><small><b>Chapter 3:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Mad, Bad &amp; Dangerous to Know&rdquo;</small></p></blockquote><p><small>&ldquo;I never considered how beautiful it really was until&hellip; Well, until I saw how it all was affecting you. But don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Miles teased, smiling as he lightly knocked his shoulder against Crowley&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anyone that you cried. I know you have a reputation to uphold.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Well, I should hope my reputation includes an appreciation for the arts,&rdquo; Crowley sniffed as they ventured toward the coat check, handing off their tickets to the attendant. Smirking, he mused, &ldquo;Let the busybodies talk all they want about my crying at the opera. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll stop hypothesizing about every other aspect of my life.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s hardly likely,&rdquo; Miles disagreed as he took his coat and scarf from the attendant, winding the blue silk around his neck before shrugging into the white pea coat and doing up the buttons. After allowing Crowley a moment to slip into his own black overcoat, the two of them set out into the cool, damp evening. <i>Just a few days more and spring would be upon them&hellip;</i></small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Why do you say that it&rsquo;s unlikely?&rdquo; Crowley asked as they waited for the valet to fetch his car. Hands in his pockets, he looked down at Miles with a deftly arched eyebrow. Miles just smiled.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Because, my<i> dear </i>Anthony, you&rsquo;re everyone&rsquo;s favourite subject. The mysterious Mr. Crowley, with his secret fortune and private Mayfair flat that no one has ever stepped foot in; you&rsquo;re positively a local fascination.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>The look in Miles&rsquo; eyes was entirely coquettish; it was no coincidence that he mentioned that no one had ever stepped foot in Crowley&rsquo;s flat. He was fishing for an invitation, hoping to be the first to break into his secret little world. Unfortunately, no invitation came; instead, Crowley just smirked and asked, &ldquo;Am I <i>your</i> favourite subject?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Only in the most confidential of company,&rdquo; Miles hemmed (<i>meaning Agatha</i>).</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;And do you find me fascinating?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Oh, <i>exceedingly</i>.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>Smiling, Miles tossed Crowley a wink as the valet pulled up with the Bentley, allowing the two of them to slide into the car&rsquo;s warmth and out of London&rsquo;s late-winter dampness.</small></p><p><small>As they drove, Miles found himself watching from the corner of his eye as Crowley tugged his white gloves off with his teeth before tossing each one in turn into the backseat. Not exactly the most <i>refined</i> way of doing things, but it <i>was </i>the most enrapturing. Delicately plucking his own off one finger at a time, Miles let his gaze properly settle on Crowley when the redhaired gentleman asked, &ldquo;What would you like to know?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;You said you find me exceedingly fascinating,&rdquo; Crowley clarified, tapping his fingers against the Bentley&rsquo;s steering wheel as he drove, the gold of his ruby ring clicking against the mahogany as he did so. &ldquo;I assume that means you&rsquo;re curious.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Well, yes. Obviously,&rdquo; Miles agreed, his cheeks turning slightly pink as he added, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not <i>presumptuous</i>. I know you like having your secrets. What right have I to them?&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;I do like having my secrets&hellip; but maybe I&rsquo;d also like having a confidant,&rdquo; Crowley mused, pausing the tapping of his ring to peek over at Miles, his lips quirking upwards at the way the other gentleman&rsquo;s jaw dropped ever-so-slightly. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;re that infamous Mr. Chatterbox, eh?
