That it helped give warmth to your neck and ears.</p><!-- more --><p>You hated the clothes. It took away from your normal silhouette \u00a0and made it look like a short, stubby man. </p><p>But it kept you warmer then before so you kept the layers on top of your shoulders, even if it did way you down like an anchor to the sea floor. </p><p>You stared at the horses with what, Jon, could only really place as fear. Your wide eyes making contact with the horse\u2019s dark ones. It was like the two of you were having a staring contest. </p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know exactly why, you knew how to read and write beyond well, you knew military strategy, yet you were afraid of a horse. It was larger than you. You were slim. Or, at least you had become slimmer since he first met you. Your khaki shirt had begun to look loose on you. And he had noticed the trousers you wore start to sag. Mainly because you kept trying to pull them up whenever they slipped down. </p><p>Were you losing weight? Was it the stress of being away from your home for so long? Was it the little people inside your old box? Was the same music growing boring?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer any of that, all he could answer was your fear of the black horse that had your bag attached to him in the early morning. </p><p>Jon walked over to you, stepping in front of you. Breaking your gaze with the animal. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Was all you said, looking up at Jon, lips in a thin line as you held one of the bags Edd had unceremoniously thrown at you when you walked down the stairs when Jon had woken you up. </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He said, gently resting his hand on the center of your back and pulling you up to the horse. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of horses if you want to be Westeros!\u201d He said, grabbing hold go either side of your waist and setting you on the horse. Both legs on one side. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d You confirmed.</p><p>He laughed at your childishness before taking the reins and handing them to you.</p><p>\u201cThat leg on the other side.\u201d He pointed to your right leg. \u201cThis one likes to run for no reason. Don\u2019t want you falling off your horse.\u201d He added before beginning to walk away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you fall off your high horse.\u201d You grumbled under your breath. </p><p>Jon turned around, swiftly when he heard what you had said. Or, more like overheard what you had grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, nothing\u201d You responded joyfully. </p><p>Jon knew what you had said, and it only took him a third of a second to realize you had decided to be just a bit of a sass. </p><p>He laughed slightly \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He responded with a smile, finally walking over to his horse to mount it. </p><p>You kept your smile on your face \u201cPrick.\u201d</p><p>He heard that too</p><p>\u201cKeep calling me names and I\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d</p><p>Your laughed boomed and echoed through castle black when he said that \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d You laughed once more, before he turned his horse around and trotted over to you. </p><p>\u201cWhat will you do shortstack?\u201d You inquired with a hint of snark in your tone and your facial expression.</p><p>\u201cShortstack?\u201d</p><p>You looked at him quizzically \u201cLike a Shortstack of Pancakes?\u201d You asked as if he would get what you were talking about.</p><p>You huffed in defeat, giving up trying to get him to understand. \u201cIt means you\u2019re short.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to have a bellowing laugh. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d seen such a smile on his face. Or heard such a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m taller than you!\u201d</p><p>You tilted your head, sympathetically. \u201cAwww, but you\u2019re not as tall as Dwayne Johnson.\u201d</p><p>With that you turned your horse to follow the rest of the men to the ships that were at the shore. </p><p>\u201cWhat was the poem again?\u201d Jon questioned as he rode next to you, a hand extended out to your horse and helping you steer the horse since you could barely do it yourself. </p><p>\u201cThe Shakespear one? It\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you recite it? Again, for me?\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded having to think for a moment before getting the words together. </p><p>\u201cTo be, or not to be: that is the question: </p><p>Whether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer </p><p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, </p><p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, </p><p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; </p><p>No more; and, by a sleep to say we end </p><p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks </p><p>That flesh is heir to, \u2019tis a consummation </p><p>Devoutly to be wish\u2019d. To die, to sleep; </p><p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there\u2019s the rub.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him, and he was smiling at you. \u201cYou sound regal when you speak like that.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled and rubbed the reins of the horse with the pad of your thumb and nodded </p><p>\u201cEarly modern english. Elegant early modern english. Many of the common people of England didn\u2019t really speak so eloquently. More formal than me, but not as formal as Shakespear would write.\u201d</p><p>He nodded \u201cA famous writer?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged slightly \u201cPoet, playwright. He was many things.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d You screamed as Jon tried to swing at you \u201cHave you lost your mind!\u201d</p><p>Jon could only tilt his head at you as you went to do an overhand throw of the sword. When you let go of it he realized what you were doing and he stumbled away as it was coming straight towards him. </p><p>When he saw and heard the steel sparring sword hit the side of the ship and go overboard, splashing in the icy cold waters all he could do was gawk at you. </p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>You only glared at him. \u201cI already have enough bruises I don\u2019t need more from those stupid non hurty swords!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at you. You weren\u2019t just feisty, you were a mature 16 year old, who at times still acted like an angry three year old. He could imagine, that it would be annoying to some. But&hellip; he found it&hellip; endearing? The way you pouted when he said something about the things that the men in the Night\u2019s Watch weren\u2019t allowed, or when you made a joke he didn\u2019t understand. The slumped shoulders that you would fake for a few seconds before making, yet another, joke he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWhen we collect wood for the arrows, it\u2019s a hit or miss on whether or not they\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>You had leaned in incredibly close, Your leg touching his as you rode on horses, Head on his shoulder looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cHit or miss?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they never miss, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe miss quite a bit actually. We use most of the wood for fires. Quite ashamed of that actually\u201d \u00a0He had admitted only for you huff and rest your head back on the neck of your horse.</p><p>But every once and awhile he\u2019d tell a joke that you\u2019d laugh at. He loved the sound of it. The laugh that made even Tormund look at you two and smile. Did Tormund nail it down that Jon liked you? No. Jon refused to think like that. Of course he didn\u2019t! He didn\u2019t know Jon that well! Did he?</p><p>Jon smiled at you and helped himself off the ground and set his sparring sword on the ground \u201cFine! We\u2019ll practice your archery.\u201d</p><p>That made you smirk. An evil glimmer showing in your eyes when he said that. Hands on your hips as he took you to the bows. Wanting you to see which bow would be better for your height and strength.</p><p>The longbow had better range you argued when he suggested a short bow.</p><p> \u201cYou might as well have a crossbow! You\u2019re too short for a long bow!\u201d He argued back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d You retorted grabbing a long bow with black leather at the handle. It was easily taller than you, standing at six feet while you stood even below him, and he wasn\u2019t six feet tall. </p><p>The handle was close to your nose. </p><p>You looked absurd. A stubborn woman who refused to use anything but a weapon that was larger than even herself. You knew it too, the moment you had it stood next to you. Eyeing the handle cautiously. </p><p>\u201cOkay&hellip; Maybe I do need a shortbow.\u201d the begrudging admission had Jon smirking at you as he grabbed a short bow and took the longbow from you and handed you the shortbow.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s more your size\u201d</p><p>Your tongue poked out at him in spite as you grabbed a quiver of arrows and marched to the targets that were set up on the ship.</p><p>He followed you, holding a tall shield as you stood, quiver already on your hip when he came over. </p><p>He placed the shield by your feet and got behind you. His chest against your back as he showed you how to hold the bow. </p><p>He was close. You felt as though he was so close he could read your thoughts. How he smelled faintly like a smoked bacon sandwich. They ate bacon at Castle Black. It wasn\u2019t that good, but it still smelled the same. Smoke, maybe the forge? The sandwich part had to be bread. Or maybe you just wanted a Starbucks sandwich with a strawberry acai. </p><p>Was this what hunger was truly like?</p><p>You could feel his chest expanding as he breathed, holding your elbow up. You were on the ball and toes of your feet, trying not to step on his own shoes.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s how close he was. So close you could smell the sandwich and even the faint leather, and so close his feet were right under yours.</p><p>You didn\u2019t feel nervous. No, this was confidence for at the very moment he began to speak, you loosed the arrow..</p><p>\u201cPap!\u201d</p><p>You pulled another arrow from the quiver and pulled it back, loosing it, like the one before it, letting it hit the bulls eye like the other \u201cPap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sound of a gun! Probably with a silencer!\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to look at him only to have him looking at you with a questioning gaze for the millionth time since you met him, that\u2019s when he looked to the target to see both arrows stuck in the bulls eyes. </p><p>\u201cHow-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in marksmanship. And the rifle team&hellip; And I took archery as a kid&hellip; and my dad is kind of a gun enthusiast.\u201d</p><p>He made a \u2018huh\u2019 noise, in surprise. He supposed you were full of surprises. From the music of your little box, and the clothing choice, to even now. </p><p>\u201cFull of surprises.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNot really. Just a girl with a grudge against Jannine Handers. Whenever my dad took me to the shooting range, I would have my friends send me pictures of her, I would print them out and use them as my target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cWhen we were three she ripped the bow off of my dress.\u201d The seriousness in your voice made him look at you in worry. </p><p>\u201cThirteen years of a grudge&hellip; because she ripped a bow off of your dress? I can\u2019t remember a single thing I was doing when I was three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, minding my own business before Jannine Carly Handers ran up and ripped the red bow off of my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrudges like that can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d</p><p>He was still close. </p><p>\u201cNo, but I think my ancestors would be proud of me. The Plantagenets and Nevills were never civil. And neither am I.\u201d You smirked as you loosed an arrow. </p><p>\u201cPlantagenet, a strange French name, for an English family.\u201d You added. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m also French.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t understand what you were saying, but he listened. Loving the sound of your voice as you loosed arrows. He let you ramble, and you hadn\u2019t even realized his hands were on your hips. </p><p>He let you ramble about the men and women who made history, he let you ramble about art and military. </p><p>\u201cYou would fail my rotc course. My PC would hate you with a burning passion.\u201d The chuckle that came after warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair. Your scruff. You have to have short hair, and no facial hair either. But, other than that I think you\u2019d pass. Then again, I think you love your hair more than the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that. \u201cOh really?\u201d He pulled one of your copper coins that he had pocketed when you said they were practically worthless unless you were a child paying for bubblegum in complete pennies and quarters. </p><p>He held it up, \u201cPenny for your backstory?\u201d</p><p>You eyed the penny that was held between his index finger and thumb. \u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d You asked pulling an arrow back and letting it fly. </p><p>\u201cWhat have you loved more than the rest of the world?\u201d </p><p>You smiled slightly, falling back into his chest, one of his arms wrapping around your torso to keep you up, as he stumbled back a step.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three pennies.\u201d You joked, not expecting him to pull two more pennies out of his pocket and handing them to your small hand. You looked at them in awe.</p><p>You didn\u2019t even have to question you response, \u201cLittle Ceasar\u2019s Pizza, with ranch, and a two liter of mountain dew on a Wendsday, watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale with my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat friends?\u201d He asked</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d You held up two of your fingers </p><p>He forked over the worthless currency that you were using to play a game you hadn\u2019t played in years, until now. </p><p>\u201cAriani, Eric and Rachel.\u201d You pulled away from his grasp on your hips, and turned to face him. \u201cYour turn snow.\u201d You replied tossing the coins to him, that he effortlessly caught. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time for your response. I know it\u2019ll be hard to think about something other than your luscious locks, Shortstack.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br/></p><p style=\"\">\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJyopGQk0OtNLaozaLwUaLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@disneyprincessbuffyannesummers</a> @<a href=\"https://strangerthingsholland.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">strangerthingsholland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQcJ41Q73x6-KoyP-pxsiLQ\" target=\"_blank\">@starkbelova</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m43S12MMFkIn9WZ9uwO5LgQ\" target=\"_blank\">@missminx1993</a> @<a href=\"https://blxkstar.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Milktea loser\" target=\"_blank\">blxkstar</a></p>",

That it helped give warmth to your neck and ears.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You hated the clothes. It took away from your normal silhouette \u00a0and made it look like a short, stubby man. </p><p>But it kept you warmer then before so you kept the layers on top of your shoulders, even if it did way you down like an anchor to the sea floor. </p><p>You stared at the horses with what, Jon, could only really place as fear. Your wide eyes making contact with the horse\u2019s dark ones. It was like the two of you were having a staring contest. </p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know exactly why, you knew how to read and write beyond well, you knew military strategy, yet you were afraid of a horse. It was larger than you. You were slim. Or, at least you had become slimmer since he first met you. Your khaki shirt had begun to look loose on you. And he had noticed the trousers you wore start to sag. Mainly because you kept trying to pull them up whenever they slipped down. </p><p>Were you losing weight? Was it the stress of being away from your home for so long? Was it the little people inside your old box? Was the same music growing boring?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer any of that, all he could answer was your fear of the black horse that had your bag attached to him in the early morning. </p><p>Jon walked over to you, stepping in front of you. Breaking your gaze with the animal. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Was all you said, looking up at Jon, lips in a thin line as you held one of the bags Edd had unceremoniously thrown at you when you walked down the stairs when Jon had woken you up. </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He said, gently resting his hand on the center of your back and pulling you up to the horse. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of horses if you want to be Westeros!\u201d He said, grabbing hold go either side of your waist and setting you on the horse. Both legs on one side. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d You confirmed.</p><p>He laughed at your childishness before taking the reins and handing them to you.</p><p>\u201cThat leg on the other side.\u201d He pointed to your right leg. \u201cThis one likes to run for no reason. Don\u2019t want you falling off your horse.\u201d He added before beginning to walk away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you fall off your high horse.\u201d You grumbled under your breath. </p><p>Jon turned around, swiftly when he heard what you had said.

But, you were still cold. The only thing he had to offer?<b><br></b></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll adjust.\u201d</p><p>He told you it was best if you kept your hair down. That it helped give warmth to your neck and ears.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You hated the clothes. It took away from your normal silhouette \u00a0and made it look like a short, stubby man. </p><p>But it kept you warmer then before so you kept the layers on top of your shoulders, even if it did way you down like an anchor to the sea floor. </p><p>You stared at the horses with what, Jon, could only really place as fear. Your wide eyes making contact with the horse\u2019s dark ones. It was like the two of you were having a staring contest. </p><p>Jon didn\u2019t know exactly why, you knew how to read and write beyond well, you knew military strategy, yet you were afraid of a horse. It was larger than you. You were slim. Or, at least you had become slimmer since he first met you. Your khaki shirt had begun to look loose on you. And he had noticed the trousers you wore start to sag. Mainly because you kept trying to pull them up whenever they slipped down. </p><p>Were you losing weight? Was it the stress of being away from your home for so long? Was it the little people inside your old box? Was the same music growing boring?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t answer any of that, all he could answer was your fear of the black horse that had your bag attached to him in the early morning. </p><p>Jon walked over to you, stepping in front of you. Breaking your gaze with the animal. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Was all you said, looking up at Jon, lips in a thin line as you held one of the bags Edd had unceremoniously thrown at you when you walked down the stairs when Jon had woken you up. </p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He said, gently resting his hand on the center of your back and pulling you up to the horse. \u201cYou can\u2019t be afraid of horses if you want to be Westeros!\u201d He said, grabbing hold go either side of your waist and setting you on the horse. Both legs on one side. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d You confirmed.</p><p>He laughed at your childishness before taking the reins and handing them to you.</p><p>\u201cThat leg on the other side.\u201d He pointed to your right leg. \u201cThis one likes to run for no reason. Don\u2019t want you falling off your horse.\u201d He added before beginning to walk away. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you fall off your high horse.\u201d You grumbled under your breath. </p><p>Jon turned around, swiftly when he heard what you had said. Or, more like overheard what you had grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, nothing\u201d You responded joyfully. </p><p>Jon knew what you had said, and it only took him a third of a second to realize you had decided to be just a bit of a sass. </p><p>He laughed slightly \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He responded with a smile, finally walking over to his horse to mount it. </p><p>You kept your smile on your face \u201cPrick.\u201d</p><p>He heard that too</p><p>\u201cKeep calling me names and I\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d</p><p>Your laughed boomed and echoed through castle black when he said that \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try!\u201d You laughed once more, before he turned his horse around and trotted over to you. </p><p>\u201cWhat will you do shortstack?\u201d You inquired with a hint of snark in your tone and your facial expression.</p><p>\u201cShortstack?\u201d</p><p>You looked at him quizzically \u201cLike a Shortstack of Pancakes?\u201d You asked as if he would get what you were talking about.</p><p>You huffed in defeat, giving up trying to get him to understand. \u201cIt means you\u2019re short.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to have a bellowing laugh. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d seen such a smile on his face. Or heard such a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m taller than you!\u201d</p><p>You tilted your head, sympathetically. \u201cAwww, but you\u2019re not as tall as Dwayne Johnson.\u201d</p><p>With that you turned your horse to follow the rest of the men to the ships that were at the shore. </p><p>\u201cWhat was the poem again?\u201d Jon questioned as he rode next to you, a hand extended out to your horse and helping you steer the horse since you could barely do it yourself. </p><p>\u201cThe Shakespear one? It\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you recite it? Again, for me?\u201d</p><p>You smiled and nodded having to think for a moment before getting the words together. </p><p>\u201cTo be, or not to be: that is the question: </p><p>Whether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer </p><p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, </p><p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, </p><p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; </p><p>No more; and, by a sleep to say we end </p><p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks </p><p>That flesh is heir to, \u2019tis a consummation </p><p>Devoutly to be wish\u2019d. To die, to sleep; </p><p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there\u2019s the rub.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him, and he was smiling at you. \u201cYou sound regal when you speak like that.\u201d</p><p>You chuckled and rubbed the reins of the horse with the pad of your thumb and nodded </p><p>\u201cEarly modern english. Elegant early modern english. Many of the common people of England didn\u2019t really speak so eloquently. More formal than me, but not as formal as Shakespear would write.\u201d</p><p>He nodded \u201cA famous writer?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged slightly \u201cPoet, playwright. He was many things.\u201d</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p style=\"\">\u2022\u2022\u2022</p><p style=\"\"><br></p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d You screamed as Jon tried to swing at you \u201cHave you lost your mind!\u201d</p><p>Jon could only tilt his head at you as you went to do an overhand throw of the sword. When you let go of it he realized what you were doing and he stumbled away as it was coming straight towards him. </p><p>When he saw and heard the steel sparring sword hit the side of the ship and go overboard, splashing in the icy cold waters all he could do was gawk at you. </p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>You only glared at him. \u201cI already have enough bruises I don\u2019t need more from those stupid non hurty swords!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at you. You weren\u2019t just feisty, you were a mature 16 year old, who at times still acted like an angry three year old. He could imagine, that it would be annoying to some. But\u2026 he found it\u2026 endearing? The way you pouted when he said something about the things that the men in the Night\u2019s Watch weren\u2019t allowed, or when you made a joke he didn\u2019t understand. The slumped shoulders that you would fake for a few seconds before making, yet another, joke he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWhen we collect wood for the arrows, it\u2019s a hit or miss on whether or not they\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>You had leaned in incredibly close, Your leg touching his as you rode on horses, Head on his shoulder looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cHit or miss?\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they never miss, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe miss quite a bit actually. We use most of the wood for fires. Quite ashamed of that actually\u201d \u00a0He had admitted only for you huff and rest your head back on the neck of your horse.</p><p>But every once and awhile he\u2019d tell a joke that you\u2019d laugh at. He loved the sound of it. The laugh that made even Tormund look at you two and smile. Did Tormund nail it down that Jon liked you? No. Jon refused to think like that. Of course he didn\u2019t! He didn\u2019t know Jon that well! Did he?</p><p>Jon smiled at you and helped himself off the ground and set his sparring sword on the ground \u201cFine! We\u2019ll practice your archery.\u201d</p><p>That made you smirk. An evil glimmer showing in your eyes when he said that. Hands on your hips as he took you to the bows. Wanting you to see which bow would be better for your height and strength.</p><p>The longbow had better range you argued when he suggested a short bow.</p><p> \u201cYou might as well have a crossbow! You\u2019re too short for a long bow!\u201d He argued back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me!\u201d You retorted grabbing a long bow with black leather at the handle. It was easily taller than you, standing at six feet while you stood even below him, and he wasn\u2019t six feet tall. </p><p>The handle was close to your nose. </p><p>You looked absurd. A stubborn woman who refused to use anything but a weapon that was larger than even herself. You knew it too, the moment you had it stood next to you. Eyeing the handle cautiously. </p><p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Maybe I do need a shortbow.\u201d the begrudging admission had Jon smirking at you as he grabbed a short bow and took the longbow from you and handed you the shortbow.</p><p> \u201cIt\u2019s more your size\u201d</p><p>Your tongue poked out at him in spite as you grabbed a quiver of arrows and marched to the targets that were set up on the ship.</p><p>He followed you, holding a tall shield as you stood, quiver already on your hip when he came over. </p><p>He placed the shield by your feet and got behind you. His chest against your back as he showed you how to hold the bow. </p><p>He was close. You felt as though he was so close he could read your thoughts. How he smelled faintly like a smoked bacon sandwich. They ate bacon at Castle Black. It wasn\u2019t that good, but it still smelled the same. Smoke, maybe the forge? The sandwich part had to be bread. Or maybe you just wanted a Starbucks sandwich with a strawberry acai. </p><p>Was this what hunger was truly like?</p><p>You could feel his chest expanding as he breathed, holding your elbow up. You were on the ball and toes of your feet, trying not to step on his own shoes.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s how close he was. So close you could smell the sandwich and even the faint leather, and so close his feet were right under yours.</p><p>You didn\u2019t feel nervous. No, this was confidence for at the very moment he began to speak, you loosed the arrow..</p><p>\u201cPap!\u201d</p><p>You pulled another arrow from the quiver and pulled it back, loosing it, like the one before it, letting it hit the bulls eye like the other \u201cPap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sound of a gun! Probably with a silencer!\u201d</p><p>You turned your head to look at him only to have him looking at you with a questioning gaze for the millionth time since you met him, that\u2019s when he looked to the target to see both arrows stuck in the bulls eyes. </p><p>\u201cHow-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in marksmanship. And the rifle team\u2026 And I took archery as a kid\u2026 and my dad is kind of a gun enthusiast.\u201d</p><p>He made a \u2018huh\u2019 noise, in surprise. He supposed you were full of surprises. From the music of your little box, and the clothing choice, to even now. </p><p>\u201cFull of surprises.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head. \u201cNot really. Just a girl with a grudge against Jannine Handers. Whenever my dad took me to the shooting range, I would have my friends send me pictures of her, I would print them out and use them as my target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cWhen we were three she ripped the bow off of my dress.\u201d The seriousness in your voice made him look at you in worry. </p><p>\u201cThirteen years of a grudge\u2026 because she ripped a bow off of your dress? I can\u2019t remember a single thing I was doing when I was three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, minding my own business before Jannine Carly Handers ran up and ripped the red bow off of my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrudges like that can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d</p><p>He was still close. </p><p>\u201cNo, but I think my ancestors would be proud of me. The Plantagenets and Nevills were never civil. And neither am I.\u201d You smirked as you loosed an arrow. </p><p>\u201cPlantagenet, a strange French name, for an English family.\u201d You added. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m also French.\u201d</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t understand what you were saying, but he listened. Loving the sound of your voice as you loosed arrows. He let you ramble, and you hadn\u2019t even realized his hands were on your hips. </p><p>He let you ramble about the men and women who made history, he let you ramble about art and military. </p><p>\u201cYou would fail my rotc course. My PC would hate you with a burning passion.\u201d The chuckle that came after warmed his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair. Your scruff. You have to have short hair, and no facial hair either. But, other than that I think you\u2019d pass.

But, you were still cold. The only thing he had to offer?<b><br /></b></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll adjust.&rdquo;</p><p>He told you it was best if you kept your hair down. That it helped give warmth to your neck and ears.</p><p>You hated the clothes. It took away from your normal silhouette &nbsp;and made it look like a short, stubby man. </p><p>But it kept you warmer then before so you kept the layers on top of your shoulders, even if it did way you down like an anchor to the sea floor. </p><p>You stared at the horses with what, Jon, could only really place as fear. Your wide eyes making contact with the horse&rsquo;s dark ones. It was like the two of you were having a staring contest. </p><p>Jon didn&rsquo;t know exactly why, you knew how to read and write beyond well, you knew military strategy, yet you were afraid of a horse. It was larger than you. You were slim. Or, at least you had become slimmer since he first met you. Your khaki shirt had begun to look loose on you. And he had noticed the trousers you wore start to sag. Mainly because you kept trying to pull them up whenever they slipped down. </p><p>Were you losing weight? Was it the stress of being away from your home for so long? Was it the little people inside your old box? Was the same music growing boring?</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t answer any of that, all he could answer was your fear of the black horse that had your bag attached to him in the early morning. </p><p>Jon walked over to you, stepping in front of you. Breaking your gaze with the animal. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo; Was all you said, looking up at Jon, lips in a thin line as you held one of the bags Edd had unceremoniously thrown at you when you walked down the stairs when Jon had woken you up. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo; He said, gently resting his hand on the center of your back and pulling you up to the horse. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be afraid of horses if you want to be Westeros!&rdquo; He said, grabbing hold go either side of your waist and setting you on the horse. Both legs on one side. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; You confirmed.</p><p>He laughed at your childishness before taking the reins and handing them to you.</p><p>&ldquo;That leg on the other side.&rdquo; He pointed to your right leg. &ldquo;This one likes to run for no reason. Don&rsquo;t want you falling off your horse.&rdquo; He added before beginning to walk away. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you fall off your high horse.&rdquo; You grumbled under your breath. </p><p>Jon turned around, swiftly when he heard what you had said. Or, more like overheard what you had grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm? Oh, nothing&rdquo; You responded joyfully. </p><p>Jon knew what you had said, and it only took him a third of a second to realize you had decided to be just a bit of a sass. </p><p>He laughed slightly &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; He responded with a smile, finally walking over to his horse to mount it. </p><p>You kept your smile on your face &ldquo;Prick.&rdquo;</p><p>He heard that too</p><p>&ldquo;Keep calling me names and I&rsquo;ll have to do something.&rdquo;</p><p>Your laughed boomed and echoed through castle black when he said that &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you try!&rdquo; You laughed once more, before he turned his horse around and trotted over to you. </p><p>&ldquo;What will you do shortstack?&rdquo; You inquired with a hint of snark in your tone and your facial expression.</p><p>&ldquo;Shortstack?&rdquo;</p><p>You looked at him quizzically &ldquo;Like a Shortstack of Pancakes?&rdquo; You asked as if he would get what you were talking about.</p><p>You huffed in defeat, giving up trying to get him to understand. &ldquo;It means you&rsquo;re short.&rdquo;</p><p>It was his turn to have a bellowing laugh. You didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d seen such a smile on his face. Or heard such a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taller than you!&rdquo;</p><p>You tilted your head, sympathetically. &ldquo;Awww, but you&rsquo;re not as tall as Dwayne Johnson.&rdquo;</p><p>With that you turned your horse to follow the rest of the men to the ships that were at the shore. </p><p>&ldquo;What was the poem again?&rdquo; Jon questioned as he rode next to you, a hand extended out to your horse and helping you steer the horse since you could barely do it yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;The Shakespear one? It&rsquo;s a quote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you recite it? Again, for me?&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and nodded having to think for a moment before getting the words together. </p><p>&ldquo;To be, or not to be: that is the question: </p><p>Whether &rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer </p><p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, </p><p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, </p><p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; </p><p>No more; and, by a sleep to say we end </p><p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks </p><p>That flesh is heir to, &rsquo;tis a consummation </p><p>Devoutly to be wish&rsquo;d. To die, to sleep; </p><p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&rsquo;s the rub.&rdquo; </p><p>You looked at him, and he was smiling at you. &ldquo;You sound regal when you speak like that.&rdquo;</p><p>You chuckled and rubbed the reins of the horse with the pad of your thumb and nodded </p><p>&ldquo;Early modern english. Elegant early modern english. Many of the common people of England didn&rsquo;t really speak so eloquently. More formal than me, but not as formal as Shakespear would write.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded &ldquo;A famous writer?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged slightly &ldquo;Poet, playwright. He was many things.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><p>&bull;&bull;&bull;</p><p><br /></p><p>&ldquo;Dude!&rdquo; You screamed as Jon tried to swing at you &ldquo;Have you lost your mind!&rdquo;</p><p>Jon could only tilt his head at you as you went to do an overhand throw of the sword. When you let go of it he realized what you were doing and he stumbled away as it was coming straight towards him. </p><p>When he saw and heard the steel sparring sword hit the side of the ship and go overboard, splashing in the icy cold waters all he could do was gawk at you. </p><p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;</p><p>You only glared at him. &ldquo;I already have enough bruises I don&rsquo;t need more from those stupid non hurty swords!&rdquo;</p><p>He shook his head at you. You weren&rsquo;t just feisty, you were a mature 16 year old, who at times still acted like an angry three year old. He could imagine, that it would be annoying to some. But&hellip; he found it&hellip; endearing? The way you pouted when he said something about the things that the men in the Night&rsquo;s Watch weren&rsquo;t allowed, or when you made a joke he didn&rsquo;t understand. The slumped shoulders that you would fake for a few seconds before making, yet another, joke he didn&rsquo;t understand.</p><p>&ldquo;When we collect wood for the arrows, it&rsquo;s a hit or miss on whether or not they&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</p><p>You had leaned in incredibly close, Your leg touching his as you rode on horses, Head on his shoulder looking up at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hit or miss?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded slowly &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I guess they never miss, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We miss quite a bit actually. We use most of the wood for fires. Quite ashamed of that actually&rdquo; &nbsp;He had admitted only for you huff and rest your head back on the neck of your horse.</p><p>But every once and awhile he&rsquo;d tell a joke that you&rsquo;d laugh at. He loved the sound of it. The laugh that made even Tormund look at you two and smile. Did Tormund nail it down that Jon liked you? No. Jon refused to think like that. Of course he didn&rsquo;t! He didn&rsquo;t know Jon that well! Did he?</p><p>Jon smiled at you and helped himself off the ground and set his sparring sword on the ground &ldquo;Fine! We&rsquo;ll practice your archery.&rdquo;</p><p>That made you smirk. An evil glimmer showing in your eyes when he said that. Hands on your hips as he took you to the bows. Wanting you to see which bow would be better for your height and strength.</p><p>The longbow had better range you argued when he suggested a short bow.</p><p> &ldquo;You might as well have a crossbow! You&rsquo;re too short for a long bow!&rdquo; He argued back.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; You retorted grabbing a long bow with black leather at the handle. It was easily taller than you, standing at six feet while you stood even below him, and he wasn&rsquo;t six feet tall. </p><p>The handle was close to your nose. </p><p>You looked absurd. A stubborn woman who refused to use anything but a weapon that was larger than even herself. You knew it too, the moment you had it stood next to you. Eyeing the handle cautiously. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip; Maybe I do need a shortbow.&rdquo; the begrudging admission had Jon smirking at you as he grabbed a short bow and took the longbow from you and handed you the shortbow.</p><p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more your size&rdquo;</p><p>Your tongue poked out at him in spite as you grabbed a quiver of arrows and marched to the targets that were set up on the ship.</p><p>He followed you, holding a tall shield as you stood, quiver already on your hip when he came over. </p><p>He placed the shield by your feet and got behind you. His chest against your back as he showed you how to hold the bow. </p><p>He was close. You felt as though he was so close he could read your thoughts. How he smelled faintly like a smoked bacon sandwich. They ate bacon at Castle Black. It wasn&rsquo;t that good, but it still smelled the same. Smoke, maybe the forge? The sandwich part had to be bread. Or maybe you just wanted a Starbucks sandwich with a strawberry acai. </p><p>Was this what hunger was truly like?</p><p>You could feel his chest expanding as he breathed, holding your elbow up. You were on the ball and toes of your feet, trying not to step on his own shoes.</p><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s how close he was. So close you could smell the sandwich and even the faint leather, and so close his feet were right under yours.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t feel nervous. No, this was confidence for at the very moment he began to speak, you loosed the arrow..</p><p>&ldquo;Pap!&rdquo;</p><p>You pulled another arrow from the quiver and pulled it back, loosing it, like the one before it, letting it hit the bulls eye like the other &ldquo;Pap!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sound of a gun! Probably with a silencer!&rdquo;</p><p>You turned your head to look at him only to have him looking at you with a questioning gaze for the millionth time since you met him, that&rsquo;s when he looked to the target to see both arrows stuck in the bulls eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;How-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in marksmanship. And the rifle team&hellip; And I took archery as a kid&hellip; and my dad is kind of a gun enthusiast.&rdquo;</p><p>He made a &lsquo;huh&rsquo; noise, in surprise. He supposed you were full of surprises. From the music of your little box, and the clothing choice, to even now. </p><p>&ldquo;Full of surprises.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;Not really. Just a girl with a grudge against Jannine Handers. Whenever my dad took me to the shooting range, I would have my friends send me pictures of her, I would print them out and use them as my target.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did she do to you?&rdquo; he asked </p><p>&ldquo;When we were three she ripped the bow off of my dress.&rdquo; The seriousness in your voice made him look at you in worry. </p><p>&ldquo;Thirteen years of a grudge&hellip; because she ripped a bow off of your dress? I can&rsquo;t remember a single thing I was doing when I was three.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, minding my own business before Jannine Carly Handers ran up and ripped the red bow off of my dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Grudges like that can&rsquo;t be healthy.&rdquo;</p><p>He was still close. </p><p>&ldquo;No, but I think my ancestors would be proud of me. The Plantagenets and Nevills were never civil. And neither am I.&rdquo; You smirked as you loosed an arrow. </p><p>&ldquo;Plantagenet, a strange French name, for an English family.&rdquo; You added. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m also French.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon didn&rsquo;t understand what you were saying, but he listened. Loving the sound of your voice as you loosed arrows. He let you ramble, and you hadn&rsquo;t even realized his hands were on your hips. </p><p>He let you ramble about the men and women who made history, he let you ramble about art and military. </p><p>&ldquo;You would fail my rotc course. My PC would hate you with a burning passion.&rdquo; The chuckle that came after warmed his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your hair. Your scruff. You have to have short hair, and no facial hair either. But, other than that I think you&rsquo;d pass. Then again, I think you love your hair more than the rest of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled at that. &ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; He pulled one of your copper coins that he had pocketed when you said they were practically worthless unless you were a child paying for bubblegum in complete pennies and quarters. </p><p>He held it up, &ldquo;Penny for your backstory?&rdquo;</p><p>You eyed the penny that was held between his index finger and thumb. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo; You asked pulling an arrow back and letting it fly. </p><p>&ldquo;What have you loved more than the rest of the world?&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled slightly, falling back into his chest, one of his arms wrapping around your torso to keep you up, as he stumbled back a step.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s three pennies.&rdquo; You joked, not expecting him to pull two more pennies out of his pocket and handing them to your small hand. You looked at them in awe.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t even have to question you response, &ldquo;Little Ceasar&rsquo;s Pizza, with ranch, and a two liter of mountain dew on a Wendsday, watching The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale with my friends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What friends?&rdquo; He asked</p><p>&ldquo;Two.&rdquo; You held up two of your fingers </p><p>He forked over the worthless currency that you were using to play a game you hadn&rsquo;t played in years, until now. </p><p>&ldquo;Ariani, Eric and Rachel.&rdquo; You pulled away from his grasp on your hips, and turned to face him. &ldquo;Your turn snow.&rdquo; You replied tossing the coins to him, that he effortlessly caught. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you time for your response.

Well, that made sense since he was the crown prince. Royals never got the bad luck. Probably because that bad and good luck thing already started before they were even born.

He still wore the Stark uniform and his plate was already half empty. </p><p>Sansa blinked a few times and then she shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the chance yet.\u201d Her cheeks heated up and she saw the smile spreading across Fredrik\u2019s face.</p><p>At times the boy reminded her of Theon and she was not sure yet if that made her happy or sad. He had the same blond curls, even though he kept them short most of the time. And just like Theon he carried a certain bravado that could come across as arrogance, but was also in a way rather charming. </p><p>\u201cOf course, my Queen, you had more important matters to discuss.\u201d He winked and Sansa couldn\u2019t help but smiling back at him. </p><!-- more --><p>She moved her chair a little closer towards Jon and then she cleared her throat. \u201cThe men ask how they should call you now you\u2019re no longer a King or a Lord.\u201d She bent her head and stared at her plate. Jon had probably noticed by now that she was barely eating, but when she looked at his plate she noticed that his appetite didn\u2019t seem like it used to be either.</p><p>Jon shrugged and he easily accepted the excuse to put his spoon down. \u201cThey can just call me Jon or Snow or whatever they like best.\u201d</p><p>Sansa furrowed her eyebrows and she leaned back in her wooden chair. She was just as much a Queen here as she was in Winterfell and even the men of the Night\u2019s Watch, known to be thieves and outcasts, seemed to respect everything she had accomplished and the fact that she had managed to keep Jon alive after he had killed the Dragon Queen. \u201cYou know they will never do that.\u201d </p><p>He might have accepted that he was no longer a King or a Lord or a Knight, but his people, her people, their people had not. He had been the one commanding their army against the Night King. He had been the one leading their troops south to kill Cersei Lannister. He had also been the one ending the tyranny of Daenerys Targaryen, even though he was surrounded by those loyal to her, including her dragon. No matter how much he wanted it, not even when he ordered them to, would they see and treat him as their equal. </p><p>Westeros might have stripped him of all titles, but not even Westeros could erase everything he had done for the Kingdom and especially the North.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to carry a title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d Sansa hissed between her teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time before Bran tells us that Daenerys\u2019 allies have left Westeros or have stopped caring.\u201d She lifted her chin a little and straightened her back. \u201cApart from that, the North is an independent Kingdom and the laws of the Six Kingdoms and their punishments can be overruled by its Queen.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk another war, even though I don\u2019t doubt we will win it, but the Northerners and I can give you every title and all honour you deserve.\u201d </p><p>Jon smiled, but he shook his head and reached for her hand. \u201cSansa\u2026\u201d He spoke softly. \u201cI know that Tyrion presented it as a punishment. That\u2019s what Grey Worm had to believe, else he wouldn\u2019t have let me go alive.\u201d The tips of his fingers, slightly rough after spending so much time in the burning cold, rubbed her knuckles. \u201cBut the only part of the punishment that really is one, is the part that keeps me away from you.\u201d Every word was sincere. \u201cI never wanted to rule people or command armies. I\u2019m fine being a bastard, banished, but free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bastard, Jon.\u201d Sansa shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been and you\u2019ll never be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d Jon leaned a little closer towards her, even though that was barely possible. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of it. I just want a calm life, Ghost somewhere near and you.\u201d He lifted his hand up and touched her cheek.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realised that a few tears had escaped her watering eyes. \u201cWill you even come back home if Bran tells us that you can return without risking countless of lives?\u201d After all, that was the future she had been holding onto, the promise that had kept her going. She could rule the North and be their Queen, as long as she knew that one day Jon would come home again to be with her. </p><p>He was the only one she would ever allow to father her children, the heirs the North so desperately needed now Bran was ruling the Six Kingdoms and Jon and Arya were so far way from Winterfell. </p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to travel all the way here for the rest of her life to see him. And she didn\u2019t want to say goodbye after only a few weeks every time he would travel south. She couldn\u2019t do that. She didn\u2019t want that. That was not the happily ever after she was promised after everything she had been through and everything she had fought for.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, Sansa.\u201d Jon squeezed her hand assuringly. \u201cI will be your husband one day and the father of your children and I will help you raise those children to become King or Queen themselves one day.\u201d He let her hand go. \u201cBut as just Jon. In your shadow.\u201d</p>",

That was not the happily ever after she was promised after everything she had been through and everything she had fought for.</p><p>&ldquo;I already told you, Sansa.&rdquo; Jon squeezed her hand assuringly. &ldquo;I will be your husband one day and the father of your children and I will help you raise those children to become King or Queen themselves one day.&rdquo; He let her hand go. &ldquo;But as just Jon. In your shadow.&rdquo;</p></p>",

And yet, Sansa can&rsquo;t just accept that Jon can never come home again, that he will never be able to answer the feelings she has for him, that she will have to marry someone else to let him father the future heirs of the North. And so she sends ravens. Ravens to Jon to tell him how much she misses him. And ravens to Bran to ask him when it is safe to end Jon&rsquo;s punishment and bring him back to Winterfell.</small></i></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://acourtofhopeanddreams.tumblr.com/post/185090223120/northern-ravens-chapter-1\">Chapter 1</a> // <a href=\"https://acourtofhopeanddreams.tumblr.com/post/185253264350/northern-ravens-chapter-2\">Chapter 2</a> // <a href=\"https://acourtofhopeanddreams.tumblr.com/post/185389713865/northern-ravens-chapter-3\">Chapter 3</a> // <a href=\"https://acourtofhopeanddreams.tumblr.com/post/185547253645/northern-ravens-chapter-4\">Chapter 4</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f50ae3c5e51f4228d6baaf701ae14e5/tumblr_inline_prz1k8WtrK1qdb55z_400.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The served dinner in Castle Black looked far better than the food Sansa had gotten during their journey from Winterfell to the North. The smell of fresh meat filled her nostrils and even though they were not presented on the table yet Sansa could also already smell the lemon cakes Jon had without a doubt made for her. </p>\n<p>And yet, instead of actually eating the food, Sansa played with it and shoved it back and forth on her plate. There were too many butterflies in her stomach to actually be hungry and the fact that she was seated a few too many inches away from Jon made her entire body restless. Having dinner and attempting to converse with her own people or the ones who spent their days with Jon in the cold North beyond the wall felt like wasting time.</p>\n<p>But she kept a smile on her face and nodded whenever she thought she had to, even though she didn&rsquo;t hear anything of what was said to her. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Did you already ask him?&rdquo; Fredrik shifted in the seat next to her. He still wore the Stark uniform and his plate was already half empty. </p>\n<p>Sansa blinked a few times and then she shook her head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get the chance yet.&rdquo; Her cheeks heated up and she saw the smile spreading across Fredrik&rsquo;s face.</p>\n<p>At times the boy reminded her of Theon and she was not sure yet if that made her happy or sad. He had the same blond curls, even though he kept them short most of the time. And just like Theon he carried a certain bravado that could come across as arrogance, but was also in a way rather charming. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, my Queen, you had more important matters to discuss.&rdquo; He winked and Sansa couldn&rsquo;t help but smiling back at him. </p>\n</p>",

But a lot of us book readers are all coming to the same conclusion: the REAL ending has to be more satisfying as opposed to hollow, cheap and VERY unearned.\u00a0</p><p>So i\u2019ve been mulling over some things and I THINK I might have cracked the Da GRRM code on what could go down by the end of this all. First we have to accept these two points:</p><ol><li>Jon kills Dany</li><li>Jon goes into Exile beyond the Wall with the Free Folk</li></ol><p>These are VERY VERY broad brushstrokes. And upsetting as they can make us&hellip;it\u2019s possible to make these ideas work. Hell the show could have made them work, but D&amp;D decided only 13 episodes was necessary. To which I say BULLSHIT.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s talk Dany first.\u00a0</p><p>We last left Dany captured by the Dothraki. The show had her basically taken back to Vales Dothrak where she torched the Khals and in the Dosh Kaleen Temple and pretty much became the Khal of Khals. Or Khaleesi of Khals. Whatever you wanna call her. She became the Stallion that Mounted the world and returned to Mereen to defeat the slavers.\u00a0</p><p>I think book Dany is going to go on a MUCH different journey. Which I think is all going to be maybe the first quarter/third of her story in WoW. I am convinced that Dany will make it to Asshai sometime before halfway through the book. What she\u2019ll learn there&hellip;no clue but she\u2019ll be there. Then she\u2019ll return to Mereen and get things in order, but i\u2019m convinced that by halfway of her story&hellip;.she\u2019ll be headed on her way to Weteros. With a possible layover in Volantis.\u00a0</p><p>The back half of her story will be dealing with Fake Aegon. And I think D&amp;D ended up incorporating too much of Faegon and Dany\u2019s story into show Jon and Dany\u2019s story. KL could very well end up torched by Dany or shit KL could very well be torched by the time she gets there. Remember Faegon\u2019s already in Westeros with the Golden Company.\u00a0</p><p>The last part of WoW (and I\u2019m talking the last quarter to third or even possibly the last chapter or so) will be all about Jon and Dany. And the beginning of their love.\u00a0 Which will be much more intense and deep&hellip;but will still end tragically. For Dany will\u00a0\u201credeem\u201d herself during the Long Night. She will be the spark that lights the Fire of Hope for those who fight back against the cold. Yes making Dany a martyr is cliche and not creative. But I trust GRRM to make it work (provided he manages to make it that far).\u00a0</p><p>But the big thing for Dany, before her sacrifice and ultimately her fall at the hands of her\u00a0\u201cBetrayal of Love\u201d from Jon. Is that before she dies, Daenerys Targaryen will hold in her arms a living child born from her womb. The show denied us boatbaby but the books will not. In the end Daenerys Targaryen will be remembered as the flame of hope, not a\u00a0\u201ctyrant\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This takes us to Jon.\u00a0</p><p>The big change with Jon, is that when Jon\u2019s soul/mind comes back from Ghost. He\u2019s gunna be a beastman. Dare i say almost a ASOIAF version of a werewolf. The first half of his WoW story will be about him coming back, regaining a sense of himself and then meeting Dany.\u00a0</p><p>Now during Jon\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWolf Days\u201d post Resurrection, we\u2019re going to see the character of Val take center stage. While I think a lot of us wrote Val off as just Jon\u2019s version of Daario. But I think she\u2019s gunna play a bigger role than any of us gave her credit for. She will be instrumental in bringing Jon back to his senses, AND the two of them will sleep together at one point. AND kicker&hellip;.Jon will father a child on her&hellip;a son. BUT Jon and Val will part ways before ether of them realizes that she\u2019s pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>SO Jon and Dany will meet. Fall in love. A beautiful, joyful yet short love. More than just some boatsex and a dragon ride. I\u2019m talking friendship, companionship, love, they\u2019re going to bare their tired and scared souls to one another and they\u2019re going to discover that all along they\u2019ve been searching for one another and will climax with them having a daughter. But to defeat the Others&hellip;they will realize they wont be able to have their Red Door and Lemon Tree. Dany will sacrifice herself to Jon and the day will be won.\u00a0</p><p>The survivors will look to Jon for leadership because at this point&hellip;his heritage will be known. But Jon will reject it. He will reject the Southern Political schemes and machinations of the South. He will chose to be free and not some puppet for schemers like say BookTyrion. This opens up for a King Bran scenario oddly enough.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking himself a Kinslayer/Oathbreaker/Queenslayer and knowing that his daughter will no doubt be used as a puppet of the South being the last\u00a0\u201cPure\u201d Targaryen (even though she\u2019s a quarter Stark). Jon then takes the babe and goes North beyond the Wall into Exile.\u00a0</p><p>There he oddly enough meets up with Val and learns that he has a son. Now of course Jon\u2019s going to feel like shit about this&hellip;but Val will set him straight. Jon will then name his daughter\u00a0\u201cDaenerys\u2019 after her mother, and will work with Val (and Ghost because Best Boy is Best Boy) to raise their son\u00a0\u201cRobb\u201d.\u00a0 Almost a mirror to Ned coming back after the Rebellion with Jon in tow\u00a0</p><p>Jon/Val won\u2019t be your typical\u00a0\u201cEndgame\u201d because Jon will still love Dany. But he will have some peace because Dany will always be with him through their daughter.\u00a0</p><p>OK&hellip;yeah. So this is a way I could see the whole thing ending. As much as I would love a happy ending of Jon &amp; Dany hopping on Drogon, grabbing Ghost and giving the bird to westeors and moving to the south shore of Lys to live at their beach-side Villa complete with red door and lemon tree&hellip;I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>Dany dying as a martyr to save her people from the ultimate form of slavery is more in tune with who Daenerys Targaryen is as a character than having her die as she tries to seduce Jon to her\u00a0\u201cNew Targ World Order\u201d after putting a city of thousands to the dragon torch.\u00a0</p><p>Is it still a shitty unfair ending for Dany? Yes. But I really dont\u2019 see how Dany makes it out alive in the books now. I\u2019d love nothing more for the final chapter to be of her and Jon with their child somewhere in peace. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gunna get that ending, no matter how much I want it. No matter how much the characters want it.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019d rather Dany die to protect the living from the slavery of undeath and be remembered as a hero&hellip;than have her die in the most unemotional overdone way possible.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jon. He\u2019ll have to live with the fact that he killed his soulmate, but he\u2019ll be free from the ambitions and politics of the south. And he\u2019ll have two children to love and raise. House Targaryen will be reborn but not in the way we thought. A Dragon is not a Slave. A Dragon is free&hellip;.and who is more free than the Free Folk?</p>",

To which I say BULLSHIT.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s talk Dany first.\u00a0</p><p>We last left Dany captured by the Dothraki. The show had her basically taken back to Vales Dothrak where she torched the Khals and in the Dosh Kaleen Temple and pretty much became the Khal of Khals. Or Khaleesi of Khals. Whatever you wanna call her. She became the Stallion that Mounted the world and returned to Mereen to defeat the slavers.\u00a0</p><p>I think book Dany is going to go on a MUCH different journey. Which I think is all going to be maybe the first quarter/third of her story in WoW. I am convinced that Dany will make it to Asshai sometime before halfway through the book. What she\u2019ll learn there\u2026no clue but she\u2019ll be there. Then she\u2019ll return to Mereen and get things in order, but i\u2019m convinced that by halfway of her story\u2026.she\u2019ll be headed on her way to Weteros. With a possible layover in Volantis.\u00a0</p><p>The back half of her story will be dealing with Fake Aegon. And I think D&amp;D ended up incorporating too much of Faegon and Dany\u2019s story into show Jon and Dany\u2019s story. KL could very well end up torched by Dany or shit KL could very well be torched by the time she gets there. Remember Faegon\u2019s already in Westeros with the Golden Company.\u00a0</p><p>The last part of WoW (and I\u2019m talking the last quarter to third or even possibly the last chapter or so) will be all about Jon and Dany. And the beginning of their love.\u00a0 Which will be much more intense and deep\u2026but will still end tragically. For Dany will\u00a0\u201credeem\u201d herself during the Long Night. She will be the spark that lights the Fire of Hope for those who fight back against the cold. Yes making Dany a martyr is cliche and not creative. But I trust GRRM to make it work (provided he manages to make it that far).\u00a0</p><p>But the big thing for Dany, before her sacrifice and ultimately her fall at the hands of her\u00a0\u201cBetrayal of Love\u201d from Jon. Is that before she dies, Daenerys Targaryen will hold in her arms a living child born from her womb. The show denied us boatbaby but the books will not. In the end Daenerys Targaryen will be remembered as the flame of hope, not a\u00a0\u201ctyrant\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This takes us to Jon.\u00a0</p><p>The big change with Jon, is that when Jon\u2019s soul/mind comes back from Ghost. He\u2019s gunna be a beastman. Dare i say almost a ASOIAF version of a werewolf. The first half of his WoW story will be about him coming back, regaining a sense of himself and then meeting Dany.\u00a0</p><p>Now during Jon\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWolf Days\u201d post Resurrection, we\u2019re going to see the character of Val take center stage. While I think a lot of us wrote Val off as just Jon\u2019s version of Daario. But I think she\u2019s gunna play a bigger role than any of us gave her credit for. She will be instrumental in bringing Jon back to his senses, AND the two of them will sleep together at one point. AND kicker\u2026.Jon will father a child on her\u2026a son. BUT Jon and Val will part ways before ether of them realizes that she\u2019s pregnant.\u00a0</p><p>SO Jon and Dany will meet. Fall in love. A beautiful, joyful yet short love. More than just some boatsex and a dragon ride. I\u2019m talking friendship, companionship, love, they\u2019re going to bare their tired and scared souls to one another and they\u2019re going to discover that all along they\u2019ve been searching for one another and will climax with them having a daughter. But to defeat the Others\u2026they will realize they wont be able to have their Red Door and Lemon Tree. Dany will sacrifice herself to Jon and the day will be won.\u00a0</p><p>The survivors will look to Jon for leadership because at this point\u2026his heritage will be known. But Jon will reject it. He will reject the Southern Political schemes and machinations of the South. He will chose to be free and not some puppet for schemers like say BookTyrion. This opens up for a King Bran scenario oddly enough.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking himself a Kinslayer/Oathbreaker/Queenslayer and knowing that his daughter will no doubt be used as a puppet of the South being the last\u00a0\u201cPure\u201d Targaryen (even though she\u2019s a quarter Stark). Jon then takes the babe and goes North beyond the Wall into Exile.\u00a0</p><p>There he oddly enough meets up with Val and learns that he has a son. Now of course Jon\u2019s going to feel like shit about this\u2026but Val will set him straight. Jon will then name his daughter\u00a0\u201cDaenerys\u2019 after her mother, and will work with Val (and Ghost because Best Boy is Best Boy) to raise their son\u00a0\u201cRobb\u201d.\u00a0 Almost a mirror to Ned coming back after the Rebellion with Jon in tow\u00a0</p><p>Jon/Val won\u2019t be your typical\u00a0\u201cEndgame\u201d because Jon will still love Dany. But he will have some peace because Dany will always be with him through their daughter.\u00a0</p><p>OK\u2026yeah. So this is a way I could see the whole thing ending. As much as I would love a happy ending of Jon &amp; Dany hopping on Drogon, grabbing Ghost and giving the bird to westeors and moving to the south shore of Lys to live at their beach-side Villa complete with red door and lemon tree\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0</p><p>Dany dying as a martyr to save her people from the ultimate form of slavery is more in tune with who Daenerys Targaryen is as a character than having her die as she tries to seduce Jon to her\u00a0\u201cNew Targ World Order\u201d after putting a city of thousands to the dragon torch.\u00a0</p><p>Is it still a shitty unfair ending for Dany? Yes. But I really dont\u2019 see how Dany makes it out alive in the books now. I\u2019d love nothing more for the final chapter to be of her and Jon with their child somewhere in peace. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gunna get that ending, no matter how much I want it. No matter how much the characters want it.\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019d rather Dany die to protect the living from the slavery of undeath and be remembered as a hero\u2026than have her die in the most unemotional overdone way possible.\u00a0</p><p>As for Jon. He\u2019ll have to live with the fact that he killed his soulmate, but he\u2019ll be free from the ambitions and politics of the south. And he\u2019ll have two children to love and raise. House Targaryen will be reborn but not in the way we thought. A Dragon is not a Slave. A Dragon is free\u2026.and who is more free than the Free Folk?</p>",

His stubble tickles your neck as his mouth sucked and licked your neck gloriously against the cold winter air. His hand rests on your hip, sliding up and down as your body moved to the rhythm of his body. His other hand cradled your head, and inches down to the tips of your hair as he pulled on them to expose more skin. He once mentioned that your neck was one of his favorite places to feast on. Small, bruised marks graced your neck one day\u2014 and it has been your favorite thing that he has ever done. His lips nibbled on your skin, and that spot underneath your ear. That was when you groaned in the darkness\u2014his hand quickly covering your mouth. His eyes twinkled in delight but also in nervousness, quick to wonder if somebody could hear the both of you. </p><!-- more --><p>Then he took his hand off of your mouth, and cupped your chin as he whispered against your lips to keep <i>quiet</i>, to be <i>still</i>, and to <i>come</i>. His body went rigid against your shuddering figure as your moans filled his ears and he grinned widely as he closed his eyes. It was his favorite sound\u2014 to hear you break down before him in pleasure of his doing, feeling you writhe as he continued to work on you, and feel his fingers around your mouth as he felt you guide his long fingers for one more round. He opened his eyes, and now it was your time to devour him. His curly locks got in the way of his exposed skin, and your fingers got to working out his top as he watched you\u2014 continuing to work you up again. </p><p>He continued to watch you. He feasts himself on the idea of you\u2014 the way you groan his name, the way you whisper it softly once the hazy daylight fills in his room, the way you would hold him down as he gets himself dragged in under the bed for a couple of minutes, and most importantly, the way that the words would roll of your tongue as you gazed at him. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d you whimpered, arching your back and feeling his stubble in contact with your neck. \u201cOh, gods&hellip;\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>Both of you stopped moving, his lips stopped sucking your neck, and he slowly reappeared in your vision. He was flushed against you, flustered with the cold wind and shocked to hear a familiar voice. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>Oswald, the stableman, asked again. Oswald was a big, old man with the deepest voice and by this point, you have already memorize what would happen. Oswald would appear in the stables, his eyes squinting in the dark as Jon again would place a hand over your mouth. You hitched a breath as he placed hs two fingers in your entrance, and worked his way up again. He curbed them inside you, feeling your back arch again\u2014 in pleasure and anticipation if both of you would ever get caught. </p><p>Oswald was also partially blind, already. </p><p>So it was a game between you and Jon. </p><p>Will you get caught? </p><p>Will Oswald spill the activity happening in his stable to the Lord of Winterfell? </p><p>Jon shushed you with his lips, biting down on your lower lip to catch it between his. That was how he shut you up. Jon pulled away, placing his forehead against yours and feeling the tiny beads of sweat on his skin. Both of you perked up when the thud of footsteps echoed out in the stables, and then you were left alone now. </p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jon whispered against your lips. He helped you with your undergarments, lifting up your heavy skirts as you rested them against your waist. \u201cWe will never get caught.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt seems that Jon Snow is right again, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt seems that way, my lady.\u201d </p><p>His eyes crinkled at the ends as he grinned, helping you lace your top. Once he was done, he picked up the fur on the ground and placed it around your shoulders. He fixed up his trousers, lacing them all the way up as your fingers laced his shirt. </p><p>He placed a kiss on the crown of your head, towering over you as he held you in his arms all of a sudden. You knew what was happening, and you tried your hardest to smile through the pain. Jon held you longer until he felt your arms creep up and hold him by the shoulder. The cold wind has nothing against the warmth of your bodies, and Jon deeply sighed as he kissed you gently. He pulled away, his thumb resting on your lower lip. </p><p>\u201cWill you be back?\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, and held out his hand as he guided you back to your quarters. He didn\u2019t answer your question not until you were inside. Then he looked down on his feet, and you glimpsed at the man you love. He was the quiet and timid man\u2014 acting as if he was smaller than every one but he was one of the bravest you have ever seen. You loved his fierceness, dedication, and his drive for the better good. </p><p>It was a stupid question, and you know it. </p><p>You smiled, holding the knob of the door as Jon rocked on his heel. You squeezed his hand as he looked up to the meet your eyes. You knew the answer and it baffled you everytime Jon would be silent on the issue. Jon deeply sighed again, and he laid a quick kiss on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, my love, and I will see you in the morning,\u201d he whispered as he walked away from your door. You looked down on the way, waiting for the silence to settle as you knew he was far away now. </p><p>In the morning, when Lord Stark and everybody has been settled on in their horses, when all the house sigils have been flagged up, all the lords and ladies of Winterfelle and commoners alike, it was time to bid farewell. </p><p>Quick glances and sneaky kisses and it was time to bid him farewell. </p><p>He straightened on his horse, and he turned his neck towards you. He nodded quickly\u2014 his eyes never leaving yours as the gates opened and slowly, they marched into the greater roads outside the wall of Winterfell. </p><p>No one knows about your time with Jon. Nobody knows why your eyes were red and your nose was running as the gates closed. Older women fussed over you\u2014 giving you cups of warm water and herbal drink to ease the cold. Nobody can sympathize with you because nobody knows that you shared something with Jon. It was a secret. A good kept secret\u2014 and it doomed your heart because you wanted him to stay, you wanted him to kiss you on the lips in broad daylight as the onlookers watched, you wanted him to hold you when you walk, and you wanted him to be with you a day longer, to feel him laugh in the morning as you harshly took back to thick furs on your gowned body as he shares a bed with you. </p><p>He always hogs the furs and the thick covers\u2014 and you wanted to him to do it again even if it all it did was annoy you. </p><p>Just one more day. </p><p>But all you could do was walk with your head high, eyes that never watered, and a tough heart as you walked in the plaza as if Jon has never been with you. </p>",

That was when you groaned in the darkness\u2014his hand quickly covering your mouth. His eyes twinkled in delight but also in nervousness, quick to wonder if somebody could hear the both of you. </p>[[MORE]]<p>Then he took his hand off of your mouth, and cupped your chin as he whispered against your lips to keep <i>quiet</i>, to be <i>still</i>, and to <i>come</i>. His body went rigid against your shuddering figure as your moans filled his ears and he grinned widely as he closed his eyes. It was his favorite sound\u2014 to hear you break down before him in pleasure of his doing, feeling you writhe as he continued to work on you, and feel his fingers around your mouth as he felt you guide his long fingers for one more round. He opened his eyes, and now it was your time to devour him. His curly locks got in the way of his exposed skin, and your fingers got to working out his top as he watched you\u2014 continuing to work you up again. </p><p>He continued to watch you. He feasts himself on the idea of you\u2014 the way you groan his name, the way you whisper it softly once the hazy daylight fills in his room, the way you would hold him down as he gets himself dragged in under the bed for a couple of minutes, and most importantly, the way that the words would roll of your tongue as you gazed at him. </p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d you whimpered, arching your back and feeling his stubble in contact with your neck. \u201cOh, gods\u2026\u201d </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>Both of you stopped moving, his lips stopped sucking your neck, and he slowly reappeared in your vision. He was flushed against you, flustered with the cold wind and shocked to hear a familiar voice. </p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>Oswald, the stableman, asked again. Oswald was a big, old man with the deepest voice and by this point, you have already memorize what would happen. Oswald would appear in the stables, his eyes squinting in the dark as Jon again would place a hand over your mouth. You hitched a breath as he placed hs two fingers in your entrance, and worked his way up again. He curbed them inside you, feeling your back arch again\u2014 in pleasure and anticipation if both of you would ever get caught. </p><p>Oswald was also partially blind, already. </p><p>So it was a game between you and Jon. </p><p>Will you get caught? </p><p>Will Oswald spill the activity happening in his stable to the Lord of Winterfell? </p><p>Jon shushed you with his lips, biting down on your lower lip to catch it between his. That was how he shut you up. Jon pulled away, placing his forehead against yours and feeling the tiny beads of sweat on his skin. Both of you perked up when the thud of footsteps echoed out in the stables, and then you were left alone now. </p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jon whispered against your lips. He helped you with your undergarments, lifting up your heavy skirts as you rested them against your waist. \u201cWe will never get caught.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt seems that Jon Snow is right again, huh?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt seems that way, my lady.\u201d </p><p>His eyes crinkled at the ends as he grinned, helping you lace your top. Once he was done, he picked up the fur on the ground and placed it around your shoulders. He fixed up his trousers, lacing them all the way up as your fingers laced his shirt. </p><p>He placed a kiss on the crown of your head, towering over you as he held you in his arms all of a sudden. You knew what was happening, and you tried your hardest to smile through the pain. Jon held you longer until he felt your arms creep up and hold him by the shoulder. The cold wind has nothing against the warmth of your bodies, and Jon deeply sighed as he kissed you gently. He pulled away, his thumb resting on your lower lip. </p><p>\u201cWill you be back?\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed, and held out his hand as he guided you back to your quarters. He didn\u2019t answer your question not until you were inside. Then he looked down on his feet, and you glimpsed at the man you love. He was the quiet and timid man\u2014 acting as if he was smaller than every one but he was one of the bravest you have ever seen. You loved his fierceness, dedication, and his drive for the better good. </p><p>It was a stupid question, and you know it. </p><p>You smiled, holding the knob of the door as Jon rocked on his heel. You squeezed his hand as he looked up to the meet your eyes. You knew the answer and it baffled you everytime Jon would be silent on the issue. Jon deeply sighed again, and he laid a quick kiss on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, my love, and I will see you in the morning,\u201d he whispered as he walked away from your door. You looked down on the way, waiting for the silence to settle as you knew he was far away now. </p><p>In the morning, when Lord Stark and everybody has been settled on in their horses, when all the house sigils have been flagged up, all the lords and ladies of Winterfelle and commoners alike, it was time to bid farewell. </p><p>Quick glances and sneaky kisses and it was time to bid him farewell. </p><p>He straightened on his horse, and he turned his neck towards you. He nodded quickly\u2014 his eyes never leaving yours as the gates opened and slowly, they marched into the greater roads outside the wall of Winterfell. </p><p>No one knows about your time with Jon. Nobody knows why your eyes were red and your nose was running as the gates closed. Older women fussed over you\u2014 giving you cups of warm water and herbal drink to ease the cold. Nobody can sympathize with you because nobody knows that you shared something with Jon. It was a secret. A good kept secret\u2014 and it doomed your heart because you wanted him to stay, you wanted him to kiss you on the lips in broad daylight as the onlookers watched, you wanted him to hold you when you walk, and you wanted him to be with you a day longer, to feel him laugh in the morning as you harshly took back to thick furs on your gowned body as he shares a bed with you. </p><p>He always hogs the furs and the thick covers\u2014 and you wanted to him to do it again even if it all it did was annoy you. </p><p>Just one more day. </p><p>But all you could do was walk with your head high, eyes that never watered, and a tough heart as you walked in the plaza as if Jon has never been with you. </p>",

That combined with the death of at least half of each couple moves us from incidental territory into the purposeful destruction of nearly all the significant relationships.

Arya and Sansa respect each other, but we don\u2019t even get a good bonding scene or goodbye between them. Jon and Sansa have a deep emotional connection, but a portion of the fandom doesn\u2019t like Sansa, so they\u2019re convinced that Jon not <i>verbally</i> forgiving Sansa means he didn\u2019t. Jon and Arya have the strongest family bond, but what happens in their last scene? Jon invites Arya to come visit him and she says, \u201cI\u2019d rather risk death exploring instead.\u201d Pretty sure that\u2019s an exact quote.</p><!-- more --><p>Now, I talk Jon\u2019s character arc here</p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-the-Game-of-Thrones-character-Jon-Snow/answer/Esther-Dot\">Esther Dot&rsquo;s answer to What is your review of the Game of Thrones character &lsquo;Jon Snow&rsquo;?</a></p><p>and I argue that it is his love for the Starks that overrides his duty to his queen, and while I think that\u2019s a valid interpretation because it makes sense of his character arc, it is (verbally) unconfirmed by the show. So, apparently the Stark family is relegated to \u201cduty\u201d which leaves us with what? Brienne in a council meeting listening to Tyrion and Bronn and their obsession with brothels, Bran stuck in his visions, Arya leaving all her family behind, Sansa alone without a single familiar face in her coronation scene, and Jon, poor Jon is back to where he had been condemned to go by his bastard status, cut off from the only family and home he knew.</p><p>As much as we throw around the descriptors of realistic, violent, grim, this ending descends into pointlessly painful. It\u2019s one thing to have a story discuss despair, it\u2019s another to have a show present the idea that there is no end but a bad one. D&amp;D, without acknowledging it, are presenting an ending in which, as much as characters try, they will never love or be loved because even if they momentarily stumble across something good, it ends in death. If you accept the general perception of the finale than this is truest for Jon who has had two women he loved die in his arms. And then they throw Ghost at our heads to distract us.</p><p>This isn\u2019t upsetting because it isn\u2019t what we wanted for the characters, this is wrong because <i>the show</i> has told us the opposite for so long. For season after season, character after character, we have been told that the bond of <i>family</i> overrides oaths and loyalty. This should have been showcased between the Starks this season because it would have given us some sense of hope for the future, but instead, the familial bond that is highlighted is between Jaime and Tyrion. Why? Because that relationship ends in death too. Are you sensing a pattern?</p><p>For our romantic couples, the only one left standing is Sam/Gilly. They\u2019re going to have a child, but he\u2019s a Maester now? And technically they\u2019re supposed to be celibate? So, while I assume Bran didn\u2019t mind, will allow it, even that ending has me scratching my head and a little worried.</p><p>As for the couples that bit the dust this season alone:</p><p>Grey Worm/Missandei</p><p>Jaime/Brienne</p><p>Euron/Cersei (I feel like that doesn\u2019t really count but they had sex so whatever)</p><p>Jaime/Cersei (bonus points for both dying!)</p><p>Jorah/Dany (kinda. Wait, they both died too!)</p><p>Jon/Dany</p><p>Gendry/Arya (They\u2019re the winners of the losers because they\u2019re both still alive!)</p><p>What\u2019s extra strange about this is that for two of these couples, there\u2019s a rush to have them have sex right before their relationship ends. Apparently, the Arya/Gendry and Brienne/Jaime hookups solely exist to make Jaime returning to Cersei more upsetting, and Arya leaving Westeros\u2026an informed decision? Sorry Gendry, for Arya, whatever you were offering was just not worth sticking around for. Make of that what you will.</p><p>It\u2019s a deliberate decision on the creators\u2019 part to bring these couples together only to emphatically tear them apart. There\u2019s a viciousness to this that moves us away from tragic and pushes us towards cruel. To top it off, what some people thought was the epic romance of the series ends with Jon stabbing Dany in the heart. The show tries to tell you that Dany is now the embodiment of evil <i>and</i> love and that Jon must kill her. I never believed that Jon loved Dany, but if you did, the climactic moment of the season, of the whole series, is <i>the death of love</i>.</p><p>D&amp;D ruthlessly destroyed one relationship after another, and while that might make us unhappy, it isn\u2019t consistent with the world they created either. The show has told us how important children are to the future, that they are why characters live and fight and that they are the means of creating political stability as well. To use one episode to undermine all of that, to pretend like they can upend how things have always been, everything they have been telling us with one scene, is laughable. Romantic, or at least, sexual relationships matter in GoT because of what it means for the future, good or bad. The future can only exist, the audience can only have hope, if we see the relationships that will provide it and secure it. And what does the finale give us? The death of all such relationships, the death of love. What do we get instead? <i>Grass</i>. They murdered love and therefore hope and thought some melting snow and vegetation was a decent substitution.</p><p>It&rsquo;s nonsensical and insulting to act like the end of so many great houses, including the Starks (8x04 is titled \u201cThe Last of the Starks\u201d) isn\u2019t without ramifications, isn\u2019t going to lead to chaos, isn\u2019t a tragedy. This all goes unacknowledged. The show doesn\u2019t adequately address the pervasive sense of isolation in the finale, and this makes the ending <i>not</i> matter because they didn\u2019t situate it in a coherent emotional context, contradicting ideas that have been integral to GoT since episode one.</p><p>Love, whether familial or romantic, has been essential to the story and characters in season after season of the show. Jon\u2019s existence is due to Ned\u2019s love for his sister, he commits treason for love of his nephew. Catelyn Stark grabs the blade of a knife with her bare hands to save Bran. Robb goes to war for his father. Jon risks death when he attempts to leave the Night\u2019s Watch to join him. Sansa begs for Ned\u2019s life on her knees. You get the idea. We have countless examples telling us that love motivates these characters, that love is essential, that love matters. Love, <i>relationships</i>, have been the core of GoT until halfway through 8x06 when they try to flip the script on us. I don\u2019t want to give the creators credit for being deliberately nihilistic. I don\u2019t think they even knew what they were communicating.</p><p>This death of love idea/lack of romantic relationships doesn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t work for the story, it doesn\u2019t work for the characters, it doesn\u2019t work in the world they created. All of it <i>could</i> have been done in a manner that worked, but none of it was. There are a dozen different ways to argue that the universal failure of relationships in the last season of GoT is a mistake, none of which are about my feelings. But speaking of those, I hated that every relationship ended in varying degrees of pain, sadness, abandonment, or death. And inexplicably, a blade of <i>grass</i> doesn\u2019t make me feel better about it.</p>",

To use one episode to undermine all of that, to pretend like they can upend how things have always been, everything they have been telling us with one scene, is laughable. Romantic, or at least, sexual relationships matter in GoT because of what it means for the future, good or bad. The future can only exist, the audience can only have hope, if we see the relationships that will provide it and secure it. And what does the finale give us?

This all goes unacknowledged.

Robb goes to war for his father. Jon risks death when he attempts to leave the Night\u2019s Watch to join him. Sansa begs for Ned\u2019s life on her knees. You get the idea. We have countless examples telling us that love motivates these characters, that love is essential, that love matters. Love, <i>relationships</i>, have been the core of GoT until halfway through 8x06 when they try to flip the script on us.

                "content": "<p>The real issue is that not only do the romantic pairings almost all end, but nearly every deep emotional bond is severed or abandoned as well. The surviving characters with the closest relationships all leave each other and go their separate ways. That combined with the death of at least half of each couple moves us from incidental territory into the purposeful destruction of nearly all the significant relationships. Think about that montage of Jon, Sansa, and Arya at the end. Sure, there are people around them, but they are <i>alone</i>.</p><p>You aren&rsquo;t exaggerating when you say no one finds love, because ultimately, it appears no one has romantic <i>or</i> familial love. Not only does romantic love die figuratively <i>and</i> literally, none of the Starks remain together. Bran is emotionally disconnected from his family in s7, and that doesn&rsquo;t change in s8. Arya and Sansa respect each other, but we don&rsquo;t even get a good bonding scene or goodbye between them. Jon and Sansa have a deep emotional connection, but a portion of the fandom doesn&rsquo;t like Sansa, so they&rsquo;re convinced that Jon not <i>verbally</i> forgiving Sansa means he didn&rsquo;t. Jon and Arya have the strongest family bond, but what happens in their last scene? Jon invites Arya to come visit him and she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather risk death exploring instead.&rdquo; Pretty sure that&rsquo;s an exact quote.</p><p>Now, I talk Jon&rsquo;s character arc here</p><p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-the-Game-of-Thrones-character-Jon-Snow/answer/Esther-Dot\">Esther Dot&rsquo;s answer to What is your review of the Game of Thrones character &lsquo;Jon Snow&rsquo;?</a></p><p>and I argue that it is his love for the Starks that overrides his duty to his queen, and while I think that&rsquo;s a valid interpretation because it makes sense of his character arc, it is (verbally) unconfirmed by the show. So, apparently the Stark family is relegated to &ldquo;duty&rdquo; which leaves us with what? Brienne in a council meeting listening to Tyrion and Bronn and their obsession with brothels, Bran stuck in his visions, Arya leaving all her family behind, Sansa alone without a single familiar face in her coronation scene, and Jon, poor Jon is back to where he had been condemned to go by his bastard status, cut off from the only family and home he knew.</p><p>As much as we throw around the descriptors of realistic, violent, grim, this ending descends into pointlessly painful. It&rsquo;s one thing to have a story discuss despair, it&rsquo;s another to have a show present the idea that there is no end but a bad one. D&amp;D, without acknowledging it, are presenting an ending in which, as much as characters try, they will never love or be loved because even if they momentarily stumble across something good, it ends in death. If you accept the general perception of the finale than this is truest for Jon who has had two women he loved die in his arms. And then they throw Ghost at our heads to distract us.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t upsetting because it isn&rsquo;t what we wanted for the characters, this is wrong because <i>the show</i> has told us the opposite for so long. For season after season, character after character, we have been told that the bond of <i>family</i> overrides oaths and loyalty. This should have been showcased between the Starks this season because it would have given us some sense of hope for the future, but instead, the familial bond that is highlighted is between Jaime and Tyrion. Why? Because that relationship ends in death too. Are you sensing a pattern?</p><p>For our romantic couples, the only one left standing is Sam/Gilly. They&rsquo;re going to have a child, but he&rsquo;s a Maester now? And technically they&rsquo;re supposed to be celibate? So, while I assume Bran didn&rsquo;t mind, will allow it, even that ending has me scratching my head and a little worried.</p><p>As for the couples that bit the dust this season alone:</p><p>Grey Worm/Missandei</p><p>Jaime/Brienne</p><p>Euron/Cersei (I feel like that doesn&rsquo;t really count but they had sex so whatever)</p><p>Jaime/Cersei (bonus points for both dying!)</p><p>Jorah/Dany (kinda. Wait, they both died too!)</p><p>Jon/Dany</p><p>Gendry/Arya (They&rsquo;re the winners of the losers because they&rsquo;re both still alive!)</p><p>What&rsquo;s extra strange about this is that for two of these couples, there&rsquo;s a rush to have them have sex right before their relationship ends. Apparently, the Arya/Gendry and Brienne/Jaime hookups solely exist to make Jaime returning to Cersei more upsetting, and Arya leaving Westeros&hellip;an informed decision? Sorry Gendry, for Arya, whatever you were offering was just not worth sticking around for. Make of that what you will.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a deliberate decision on the creators&rsquo; part to bring these couples together only to emphatically tear them apart. There&rsquo;s a viciousness to this that moves us away from tragic and pushes us towards cruel.
