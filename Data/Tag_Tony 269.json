The military (and\nspecially Thaddeus Ross) is putting lot of pressure on him to finish his\nsupersoldier formula, to the point they are cutting his funds by a third and\nfired his lab assistant. Bruce doesn\u2019t know how to make them understand that\nthere are things in this world that you cannot rush. Science the first. But as\nthe say goes: \u2018Hit first, hit twice\u2019; and they are desperate to hit first. Who\nor why they didn\u2019t tell but apparently there is always a war to fight\nsomewhere. So Bruce works extra hours; neglect his girlfriend; lives on cheap\nnoodles on a tiny one-room apartment and basically, has a shitty life; only to\ngive the world his formula and move on.</p><p>Problem is,\nhe is not one hundred percent sure; the project was closed for many years and\nthe research of Abraham Erskine and his team was not properly storage so, when\nthey came back to it many things were missing. Including the man\u2019s personal\njournal were it is said it was the complete formula. Bruce had to start almost\nfrom zero with papers wrote decades ago, mostly decomposed; written on a weird\ndialect half German, half English, half something else (Czech? Polish?), with\nalmost no help. And what are his thanks? A snarky comment from General Ross\nabout how he doesn\u2019t tolerate failure. (Bruce would love to tell him that such\nan affirmation makes him a lousy scientific and for that he shouldn\u2019t be part\nof the project or any other project, ever).</p><p>For the thousandth\ntime, the good Doctor grabs the needle and puts it back on the table. If he is\nright, it would be his biggest achievement, maybe the biggest achievement on\nscience since the 40s. He could even win a prize, heck, more like several\nprizes; it definitely would open the door to a new generation of cheaper and\nmore effective vaccines. Maybe be the first step to eradicate all sickness in\nthe world. </p><p>If he is\nwrong, shit, there are so many possibilities he just cannot pick one; it could\nturn people on mutated monsters, it could kill them, it could\u2026 it could\u2026</p><p>Bruce has\nto stop those thoughts; he doesn\u2019t need the images of people with third degree\nburns and large blisters filled with yellow fluid to add to his nightmares of\neverything that could go wrong. After science knows how long he finally snaps,\nfalls on the floor on his knees and screams.</p><p>\u2018What I\u2019m\nsupposed to do? Someone, please, send me a signal and tell me what to do!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Hello\u2019</p><!-- more --><p>Bruce is\nstartled, who the hell is in his laboratory? Why? The man is staring at him;\nwaiting for a response but Doctor Banner just cannot bring the words up. He is\ntoo surprise; too exhausted; too fucked up in general to behave as a normal\nhuman being. He is dead and social interactions with him. So he points to the\nneedle and collapse on the floor. The man sits next to him, needle on hand.</p><p>\u2018This tiny\nthing is what is causing you so much trouble?\u2019 He asks</p><p>Bruce keeps\nsilent, staring at the ceiling. Why he doesn\u2019t pick the fucking needle and race\nto Ross?</p><p>\u2018I can\nbarely imagine all the hard work you have put in this, and yet there is still a\nchance of failure that hunts you down.\u2019</p><p>Bruce nods,\nstill refusing to get out of his non verbal phase.</p><p>\u2018This is no\neasy matter for you of course, there are lives at risk. Luckily, I\u2019m here to\nchase the darkness away.\u2019</p><p>Bruce\nsnorts.</p><p>\u2018Seriously,\nI\u2019m here to help you to depict the consequences of your acts and to make the\nsmartest decision.\u2019</p><p>Bruce looks\nat the man for the first time.
