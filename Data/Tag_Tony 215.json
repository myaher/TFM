        "answer": "<p>Let\u2019s do superfamily with this one! :D</p><p><br/></p><p>-Tony and Peter, for some reason that Steve cannot grasp his mind around, love Black Friday.</p><p>-Don\u2019t get Steve wrong, he loves a good sale because even with marrying a billionaire, he doesn\u2019t like to spend a lot of money on frivolous things (except when it comes to Peter because that\u2019s his baby boy and he\u2019ll spoil him if he wants). But there\u2019s no reason to cut Thanksgiving dinner short to go to the stores. <br/></p><p>-\u201dYou guys do realize we\u2019re not actually strapped for money, right? Right?\u201d</p><p>-\u201dBabe, this isn\u2019t for the sales. It\u2019s for the <i>chaos. </i>Middle-class white suburbans moms<i> </i>throwing it down with each other in the middle of Target. Sign me the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>-Tony tells him with an evil grin and his teenage son follows suit with an actually matching evil, but adorable grin (the fact that he\u2019s bundled up in about a hundred layers helps with this look) and Steve prays for their souls.</p><p>-Tony gets Happy to drive them nearly an hour away to the most popular Target and drop them off. They\u2019re already a massive crowd huddled near the doors waiting for them to open. A few fights have already broken out if anything was to be said about the numerous cop cars and cops around. <br/></p><p>-\u201dThis is gonna be so much fun,\u201d Tony says gleefully, rubbing his hands together.</p><p>-Steve gives his a husband a bewildered look before wrapping a protective arm around Peter and bringing him close.</p><p>-The doors open and Steve grabs a hold of Tony\u2019s hoodie and pulls him back before he can join the sea of white moms.\u00a0 <br/></p><p>-Tony pouts.<br/></p><p>-Once they get in Steve pretty much all but carries Peter around, not trusting a single person in this store, <i>including </i>his husband. <br/></p><p>-\u201dPops, I\u2019m fifteen, please put me down. I\u2019m not a baby.\u201d</p><p>-\u201dNope.\u201d Steve all but says watching a woman climb onto a shelf and throw herself into a sea of people in order to grab a crockpot that was on sale.</p><p>-Peter - :(</p><p>-They lose sight of Tony so they have to walk around trying to find him. Finally, Steve gives up and just goes to the grocery area where it\u2019s completely empty.

        "body": "<p><i>fandom</i>: Stony (Steve x Tony), MCU</p><p><i>summary</i>: After a long, tiring week Steve falls asleep on Tony and Tony takes it on himself to put his soldier to rest and at ease.<br/></p><p><i>length</i>: 973 words</p><p><i>a/n</i>: I dedicate this fic to my tumblr daughter <a href=\"https://princess-evans-addict.tumblr.com/\">@priness-evans-addict\u00a0</a>\u00a0- I saw you were going through some rough weeks and I wanted to write something for you - it is just a small fic, but I hope it will make you feel calmer and comforted\u00a0\u2665<br/></p><p><i>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</i></p><p><b>Chamomile, Lavender, Vetiver, and Cedarwood</b></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oof.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>Tony grunted quietly, when a heavy super soldier slid on him, completely limp, almost smothering him into the couch. Just a few minutes ago, Steve was wide awake, stuffing handfuls of colorful button-shaped chocolates in his mouth, and when the sugar high ended, he had fallen asleep, minutes after the movie started.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Steve,&rdquo; Tony said in a low whisper, slowly maneuvering his sleeping boyfriend&rsquo;s body and untangling himself from the super soldier death trap. \u00a0Steve was completely motionless, his head rolled to the back and his chest rhythmically raising up and down. Out as a light, heavy as a log. &ldquo;Okay, big guy, time for bed,&rdquo; Tony decided, standing up and pulling his boyfriend up.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;M'fine\u2026&rdquo; Steve replied in his half-awake state and Tony resorted to a courteous eye roll. <i>Casablanca</i> playing on the TV, binging on m&amp;ms\u2026 \u00a0When Steve proposed a movie night, Tony agreed, always up to spending some time with his boyfriend, even if the mood of the evening was nostalgia, it was important to share such moments together. The moment ended when half of the involved party fell asleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you are,&rdquo; Tony agreed halfheartedly, putting more strength into it and after some efforts, he managed to pull Steve up and slung the soldier&rsquo;s arm around his shoulders for more support. &ldquo;Come on, baby, walk with me,&rdquo; he urged, tapping his bare foot against Steve&rsquo;s socked one, snorting when Steve mumbled something about dancing and having two left feet.</p><p>Slowly, step by step, they reached their shared bedroom, Tony asking Friday appropriately earlier to prepare everything and when they walked into the room, it was already nicely dim and cozy and in just the right temperature and level of humidity for a good night of sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;You need to brush your teeth,&rdquo; Tony reminded, squeezing Steve closer when his boyfriend almost tumbled on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get cavity,&rdquo; Steve bargained, making some longing sounds and reaching his hand for the bed. He just wanted to lay down already.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on, brush your teeth and I will give you a nice goodnight kiss,&rdquo; Tony gave an offer on his own, humming out the words enticingly and patting Steve&rsquo;s chest to make him a bit more awake. It did happen that Tony himself fell to sleep numerous times as he was standing, often in clothes reeking of car grease and sweat, but he always brushed his teeth - waking up and feeling that unpleasant dryness and an aftertaste reminding him of chewed shoes, was never fun.</p><p>More groaning, more sleepy whimpering, but in the end, Steve obediently walked to the en-suite bathroom to get some basic evening rituals done. Tony continued his work with making their bedroom extra cozy, knowing how hard the passing week was on his boyfriend. Debriefings, meetings, negotiations - seemed that each time Steve had left the conference room, he had to run straight back into it. Put him on the battlefield and make him fight - it was his element, it was draining for sure, but not as psychically exhausting as countless hours of talks and drafts. Tony opened the drawer in the nightstand table on his side of the bed and took out his secret weapon, a homemade mix of essentials oils and some distilled water in a spray bottle. He fluffed Steve&rsquo;s pillow a few times before giving the material a few puffs. Chamomile, lavender, vetiver, and cedarwood. Herbal, sweet, earthy and woody. The calming, warm scent would guarantee some good dreams.</p><p>There was a sound of the door closing, and Tony smiled at his fumbling soldier. Steve walked to him, keeping his eyes half closed and there was something endearing about watching the usually alert and collected man so drowsy and almost helpless.</p><p>&ldquo;Arms up,&rdquo; Tony ordered, sitting Steve on the bed, and pulling his shirt off when the soldier obeyed. Then trousers and socks. Even underwear as it was warm enough for Steve to sleep completely nude. After putting the clothes aside, Tony pushed his boyfriend down gently and Steve listened, lowering his face into the pillow and breathing in the sweet scent of essential oils.</p><p>&ldquo;Get some rest,&rdquo; Tony said, tucking the blanket around Steve&rsquo;s body. When he started to wrap the material around his feet, Steve kicked his legs, laughing a bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Nooo, too hot,&rdquo; came the first protest of the evening, and Tony smiled, registering the small laugh and sensing that it wasn&rsquo;t the reason. Being the amazing and caring boyfriend he was, Tony doubled his efforts.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to tuck you in!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nooo, To-ony!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if some monster will come and grab your leg?! This is for your own safety!&rdquo; Tony justified himself, trying to tame the restless feet, his fingers brushing Steve&rsquo;s soles playfully, adding to soldier&rsquo;s laughter. It went on for a bit, but Tony didn&rsquo;t want to bother his boyfriend too much and gave up after a while with an exaggerated huff.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; Tony said in a light voice, ceasing his efforts and moving away, letting Steve place his legs in any way he wanted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me if you stick your feet out during the night and wake up without them.&rdquo;</p><p>There was no answer, just another small laugh. Tony couldn&rsquo;t help but smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodnight, hun,&rdquo; Tony leaned down and placed a lingering kiss on Steve&rsquo;s warm cheek, smelling in the herbs and flowers and mint from the toothpaste. Steve hummed his goodnight, his eyes finally closing to sleep. Tony stayed for a bit longer, combing his fingers through the blond hair and just taking in the moment.

The moment ended when half of the involved party fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Tony agreed halfheartedly, putting more strength into it and after some efforts, he managed to pull Steve up and slung the soldier\u2019s arm around his shoulders for more support. \u201cCome on, baby, walk with me,\u201d he urged, tapping his bare foot against Steve\u2019s socked one, snorting when Steve mumbled something about dancing and having two left feet.</p><p>Slowly, step by step, they reached their shared bedroom, Tony asking Friday appropriately earlier to prepare everything and when they walked into the room, it was already nicely dim and cozy and in just the right temperature and level of humidity for a good night of sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou need to brush your teeth,\u201d Tony reminded, squeezing Steve closer when his boyfriend almost tumbled on the bed.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get cavity,\u201d Steve bargained, making some longing sounds and reaching his hand for the bed. He just wanted to lay down already.</p><p>\u201cCome on, brush your teeth and I will give you a nice goodnight kiss,\u201d Tony gave an offer on his own, humming out the words enticingly and patting Steve\u2019s chest to make him a bit more awake. It did happen that Tony himself fell to sleep numerous times as he was standing, often in clothes reeking of car grease and sweat, but he always brushed his teeth - waking up and feeling that unpleasant dryness and an aftertaste reminding him of chewed shoes, was never fun.</p><p>More groaning, more sleepy whimpering, but in the end, Steve obediently walked to the en-suite bathroom to get some basic evening rituals done. Tony continued his work with making their bedroom extra cozy, knowing how hard the passing week was on his boyfriend. Debriefings, meetings, negotiations - seemed that each time Steve had left the conference room, he had to run straight back into it. Put him on the battlefield and make him fight - it was his element, it was draining for sure, but not as psychically exhausting as countless hours of talks and drafts. Tony opened the drawer in the nightstand table on his side of the bed and took out his secret weapon, a homemade mix of essentials oils and some distilled water in a spray bottle. He fluffed Steve\u2019s pillow a few times before giving the material a few puffs. Chamomile, lavender, vetiver, and cedarwood. Herbal, sweet, earthy and woody. The calming, warm scent would guarantee some good dreams.</p><p>There was a sound of the door closing, and Tony smiled at his fumbling soldier. Steve walked to him, keeping his eyes half closed and there was something endearing about watching the usually alert and collected man so drowsy and almost helpless.</p><p>\u201cArms up,\u201d Tony ordered, sitting Steve on the bed, and pulling his shirt off when the soldier obeyed. Then trousers and socks. Even underwear as it was warm enough for Steve to sleep completely nude. After putting the clothes aside, Tony pushed his boyfriend down gently and Steve listened, lowering his face into the pillow and breathing in the sweet scent of essential oils.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest,\u201d Tony said, tucking the blanket around Steve\u2019s body. When he started to wrap the material around his feet, Steve kicked his legs, laughing a bit.</p><p>\u201cNooo, too hot,\u201d came the first protest of the evening, and Tony smiled, registering the small laugh and sensing that it wasn\u2019t the reason. Being the amazing and caring boyfriend he was, Tony doubled his efforts.</p><p>\u201cI have to tuck you in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo, To-ony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if some monster will come and grab your leg?! This is for your own safety!\u201d Tony justified himself, trying to tame the restless feet, his fingers brushing Steve\u2019s soles playfully, adding to soldier\u2019s laughter. It went on for a bit, but Tony didn\u2019t want to bother his boyfriend too much and gave up after a while with an exaggerated huff.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Tony said in a light voice, ceasing his efforts and moving away, letting Steve place his legs in any way he wanted. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me if you stick your feet out during the night and wake up without them.\u201d</p><p>There was no answer, just another small laugh. Tony couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, hun,\u201d Tony leaned down and placed a lingering kiss on Steve\u2019s warm cheek, smelling in the herbs and flowers and mint from the toothpaste. Steve hummed his goodnight, his eyes finally closing to sleep. Tony stayed for a bit longer, combing his fingers through the blond hair and just taking in the moment. It wasn\u2019t the romantic evening he counted for, but this was sweet too.</p><p>Until Steve started to snore like a chainsaw and Tony had to evacuate himself out of the bedroom.

You let him know I knocked you out the sky last week with one good throw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t let me have one thing?\u201d Sam complained. \u201cAnd anyway, Tony, you and I are fixing that.

Though you\u2019re not allowed to fly it, no matter how many times you ask.\u201d Sam opened a small panel that Tony hadn\u2019t noticed, and typed in a code. Several panels rose up and out of the backpack, revealing some wiring and inner machinery. \u201cYou want to see how it works?\u201d Tony looked at Natasha. She raised her eyebrows and nodded.

Tony was \u2026 having fun. There was no deadline, it really didn\u2019t seem like they cared what he made, or even if he made any progress. In some ways, it was more relaxed than home. He just wished Jarvis was here. Then Natasha returned, holding some folded plaid pajamas.</p><p>\u201cTime for bed, Tony. Looks like you boys are having fun, but we\u2019re trying to be responsible guardians, here.\u201d Sam reached to the ceiling and rolled his shoulders back, letting out a groan.</p><p>\u201cMan, I\u2019m tired. Save our stuff, will you, J- Karen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sam.\u201d The images disappeared. Sam pushed himself to his feet, and held out a hand to Tony.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d Tony accepted the hand to pull himself up, and walked with Sam and Natasha back to his room. They were talking in low voices about spider bites, for some reason. He hoped there weren\u2019t dangerous spiders in future-New-York.</p><p>Natasha gave him the pajamas to change into. Looking in the bathroom mirror, Tony tried to imagine his face, forty years older. He didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d grow a beard like that. Taking his shirt off, he saw that the purple bruising along his ribs had faded to a brownish yellow. The swelling on his fore-arm was barely noticeable, now. Thankfully, the shirt Natasha had given him was a button-down. </p><p>When he came back into his room, Sam had something small and green in his hand. He held it out, and Tony realized it was a plushie, but a very strange one; it looked like Frankenstein\u2019s monster in shorts.</p><p>\u201cThis is our friend Bruce. You\u2019ll meet him tomorrow. Sometimes he worries that he\u2019s scary, but you\u2019ve got to remember, he\u2019s just a softie really.\u201d Natasha was hiding her mouth behind her hand.</p><p>\u201cYour friend\u2019s green?\u201d Tony wasn\u2019t sure what he wouldn\u2019t believe, at this point.</p><p>\u201cHopefully not when you see him,\u201d Sam said, motioning for Tony to take the toy.</p><p> \u201cI don\u2019t need a toy,\u201d Tony said uncertainly. He didn\u2019t understand why they seemed so willing to let him waste his time with baby stuff.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Sam frowned. \u201cBut my niece has one just like this, only of our other friend, Clint. And she\u2019s a year older than you. I suppose I could give it to her, if you don\u2019t want it \u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said, reaching out to take it. \u201cIf she has one, then I suppose that \u2013 that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Sam said, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s called Hulk.\u201d</p><p><i>Read more:\u00a0https://archiveofourown.org/works/16441238/chapters/39269758</i></p>",

Thor\nbehind him. \u00a0Seeing their friend in this\ncramped space, ducking to get inside the area but coming closer so carefully,\nwatching him with worried blue eyes and keeping his distance like he was afraid\nhe might spook an injured animal\u2026 \u00a0Steve\nsucked in a shaking breath and wiped wildly at his cheeks. \u00a0It took an incredible amount of determination\nbut he calmed himself, too ashamed to do anything else. \u00a0He pushed a hand through his hair and hauled\nin breath after breath until the tiny, shadowy nook stopped spinning and he\ncould focus beyond his skin crawling and his pulse drumming in his ears.</p><!-- more --><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nAfter what felt like forever, Thor\nquietly asked, \u201cAre you well, my friend?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThat was a stupid question. \u00a0Steve managed to gather himself more, nodding\nvigorously before he actually managed to speak. \n\u201c\u2019m fine,\u201d he mumbled. \u00a0The weight\nof Thor\u2019s gaze felt damning, and he turned before he thought better of it. \u00a0He supposed it made sense for Thor to be staring\nat him as he was, scrutinizing him, but all he could glimpse in the other man\u2019s\neyes was grief. \u00a0And worry. \u00a0And <i>pity.</i> \u00a0Steve took another breath, turning back to\nthe shadows. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine. \u00a0Everythin\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt does not seem to be.\u201d \u00a0Steve felt more than saw Thor take a step\ncloser. \u00a0\u201cNor does it need to be.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve closed his eyes\nhelplessly. \u00a0How could he be so deluded\nto think he could hide anything? \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll\nbe okay.\u201d \u00a0His voice was hardly anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor didn\u2019t answer right away, and\nwhen he did, the words hurt. \u00a0\u201cIn time,\u201d\nhe offered quietly, \u201cand with help. \u00a0You\nseem very little like the man I knew four months ago.\u201d \u00a0Hearing someone else say that was beyond\npainful. \u00a0In a way, as stressful as it\nhad been being surrounded by these strangers, that had been a shield of sorts,\ntoo. \u00a0These people, whether it be the\nGuardians or the Nova Corpsmen or the Xandarian doctors, had never known them\nbefore Hell. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t see the\ncontrast, so it wasn\u2019t so obvious what had been changed. \u00a0What had been lost and damaged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nBeing with Thor was direct\nevidence of all of that. \u00a0The last time\nSteve had talked to the God of Thunder had been right before the battle where\nhe and Tony had been kidnapped. \u00a0Thor had\nbeen bickering with Barton over some movie they\u2019d watched, and he\u2019d wanted\nSteve\u2019s opinion (and for that opinion to match his, of course). \u00a0Steve hadn\u2019t ever seen the movie in question,\nbut Thor had been loud and affectionate and cajoling, and they\u2019d all laughed\nlike good buddies. \u00a0That had been four\nmonths ago.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nFour months.</i> \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been kidnapped. \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been to Earth, to New York. \u00a0Four\nmonths since he\u2019d been Captain America. \nIn reality, that wasn\u2019t much time at all, but in the pit? \u00a0In Hell? \nThe days had gone on and on. \u00a0A\nlifetime of them had passed painfully slowly, moment by moment with so much darkness\nand so little hope. \u00a0\u201cNot sure that I\nam,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nTo that Thor said nothing at\nfirst, and the hum of the ship was very loud. \nSteve could almost hear Tony softly and evenly breathing where the other\nman still slumbered in the bunk. \u00a0<i>At least he\u2019s asleep. \u00a0He\u2019s still sleeping.</i> \u00a0Steve shivered in relief, rubbing his arms\nthrough his shirt and bristling anew at how unpleasant his own touch was. \u00a0It was constant, this tickling under his skin\nlike an itch he could never scratch, throbbing in his muscles like pain he\ncouldn\u2019t massage away. \u00a0Tears stung his\neyes again. \u00a0God, he was pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor sighed. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know the particulars of what\nhappened. \u00a0I doubt anyone does, aside\nfrom you and Stark. \u00a0Still, I was told\nenough about your captivity that my imagination has no difficulty in providing\nthe details.\u201d \u00a0Steve closed his eyes\ntighter. \u201cThere is a reason that prisoners of the Kree rarely live to relay\ntheir tale. \u00a0I can see it you both, signs\nof the deepest suffering, and I am sorry, truly sorry, that I was not able to\nfind you time.\u201d \u00a0Thor\u2019s tone grew taut\nwith anger. \u00a0\u201cMy father\u2026 \u00a0He would not permit me to use Asgard\u2019s\nresources to search for you. \u00a0When it\nbecame obvious Earthen forces were not going to be nearly sufficient, I\nreturned home and beseeched him for aid. \nHe gave me none and forbid me to spend my time trying to find you. \u00a0I defied him, of course, but I wasted\nprecious weeks, and without Heimdall\u2019s aid\u2026\u201d \nSteve vaguely knew who that was. \nThor had mentioned him once or twice before. \u00a0Heimdall was his dear friend, the guardian of\nthe Bifrost, someone with the powerful, magical capability of seeing every soul\nin the galaxy. \u00a0 If Thor had had his\nhelp, if he\u2019d been able to find them right away, before they\u2019d been sold at the\nslave auction and brought to the moon\u2026</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Thor murmured again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve opened his eyes. \u00a0He didn\u2019t turn around. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even absolve Thor. \u00a0He probably should have, but he just didn\u2019t\nhave the strength. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d\nhe finally said as the silence dragged on. \nThat seemed so cruel, so final, and despite all the pain\u2026 \u00a0He just couldn\u2019t leave it that way. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re lucky you found us. \u00a0Lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt is not luck that allowed you\nto survive.\u201d \u00a0To be honest, Steve didn\u2019t\nwant to hear this. \u00a0He knew what Thor was\ngoing to say, and he didn\u2019t want someone consoling him or telling him how\nstrong and brave they had been to live through what they had. \u00a0Maybe that was petty, because he\u2019d always\nbelieved in comforting

friend?\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThat was a stupid question. \u00a0Steve managed to gather himself more, nodding\nvigorously before he actually managed to speak. \n\u201c\u2019m fine,\u201d he mumbled. \u00a0The weight\nof Thor\u2019s gaze felt damning, and he turned before he thought better of it. \u00a0He supposed it made sense for Thor to be staring\nat him as he was, scrutinizing him, but all he could glimpse in the other man\u2019s\neyes was grief. \u00a0And worry. \u00a0And <i>pity.</i> \u00a0Steve took another breath, turning back to\nthe shadows. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine. \u00a0Everythin\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt does not seem to be.\u201d \u00a0Steve felt more than saw Thor take a step\ncloser. \u00a0\u201cNor does it need to be.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve closed his eyes\nhelplessly. \u00a0How could he be so deluded\nto think he could hide anything? \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll\nbe okay.\u201d \u00a0His voice was hardly anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor didn\u2019t answer right away, and\nwhen he did, the words hurt. \u00a0\u201cIn time,\u201d\nhe offered quietly, \u201cand with help. \u00a0You\nseem very little like the man I knew four months ago.\u201d \u00a0Hearing someone else say that was beyond\npainful. \u00a0In a way, as stressful as it\nhad been being surrounded by these strangers, that had been a shield of sorts,\ntoo. \u00a0These people, whether it be the\nGuardians or the Nova Corpsmen or the Xandarian doctors, had never known them\nbefore Hell. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t see the\ncontrast, so it wasn\u2019t so obvious what had been changed. \u00a0What had been lost and damaged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nBeing with Thor was direct\nevidence of all of that. \u00a0The last time\nSteve had talked to the God of Thunder had been right before the battle where\nhe and Tony had been kidnapped. \u00a0Thor had\nbeen bickering with Barton over some movie they\u2019d watched, and he\u2019d wanted\nSteve\u2019s opinion (and for that opinion to match his, of course). \u00a0Steve hadn\u2019t ever seen the movie in question,\nbut Thor had been loud and affectionate and cajoling, and they\u2019d all laughed\nlike good buddies. \u00a0That had been four\nmonths ago.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nFour months.</i> \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been kidnapped. \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been to Earth, to New York. \u00a0Four\nmonths since he\u2019d been Captain America. \nIn reality, that wasn\u2019t much time at all, but in the pit? \u00a0In Hell? \nThe days had gone on and on. \u00a0A\nlifetime of them had passed painfully slowly, moment by moment with so much darkness\nand so little hope. \u00a0\u201cNot sure that I\nam,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nTo that Thor said nothing at\nfirst, and the hum of the ship was very loud. \nSteve could almost hear Tony softly and evenly breathing where the other\nman still slumbered in the bunk. \u00a0<i>At least he\u2019s asleep. \u00a0He\u2019s still sleeping.</i> \u00a0Steve shivered in relief, rubbing his arms\nthrough his shirt and bristling anew at how unpleasant his own touch was. \u00a0It was constant, this tickling under his skin\nlike an itch he could never scratch, throbbing in his muscles like pain he\ncouldn\u2019t massage away. \u00a0Tears stung his\neyes again. \u00a0God, he was pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor sighed. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know the particulars of what\nhappened. \u00a0I doubt anyone does, aside\nfrom you and Stark. \u00a0Still, I was told\nenough about your captivity that my imagination has no difficulty in providing\nthe details.\u201d \u00a0Steve closed his eyes\ntighter. \u201cThere is a reason that prisoners of the Kree rarely live to relay\ntheir tale. \u00a0I can see it you both, signs\nof the deepest suffering, and I am sorry, truly sorry, that I was not able to\nfind you time.\u201d \u00a0Thor\u2019s tone grew taut\nwith anger. \u00a0\u201cMy father\u2026 \u00a0He would not permit me to use Asgard\u2019s\nresources to search for you. \u00a0When it\nbecame obvious Earthen forces were not going to be nearly sufficient, I\nreturned home and beseeched him for aid. \nHe gave me none and forbid me to spend my time trying to find you. \u00a0I defied him, of course, but I wasted\nprecious weeks, and without Heimdall\u2019s aid\u2026\u201d \nSteve vaguely knew who that was. \nThor had mentioned him once or twice before. \u00a0Heimdall was his dear friend, the guardian of\nthe Bifrost, someone with the powerful, magical capability of seeing every soul\nin the galaxy. \u00a0 If Thor had had his\nhelp, if he\u2019d been able to find them right away, before they\u2019d been sold at the\nslave auction and brought to the moon\u2026</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Thor murmured again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve opened his eyes. \u00a0He didn\u2019t turn around. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even absolve Thor. \u00a0He probably should have, but he just didn\u2019t\nhave the strength. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d\nhe finally said as the silence dragged on. \nThat seemed so cruel, so final, and despite all the pain\u2026 \u00a0He just couldn\u2019t leave it that way. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re lucky you found us. \u00a0Lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt is not luck that allowed you\nto survive.\u201d \u00a0To be honest, Steve didn\u2019t\nwant to hear this. \u00a0He knew what Thor was\ngoing to say, and he didn\u2019t want someone consoling him or telling him how\nstrong and brave they had been to live through what they had. \u00a0Maybe that was petty, because he\u2019d always\nbelieved in comforting those who needed it, and he definitely needed it. \u00a0It was that optimism that Tony had so often\ndetested down in the pit, that belief that fundamentally things were alright\nand people were decent and deserved a fair shake. \u00a0That an individual had the power to live a\ngood life and do the right thing no matter what. \u00a0Those beliefs had survived the worst horrors\nof humanity

speak. \n\u201c\u2019m fine,\u201d he mumbled. \u00a0The weight\nof Thor\u2019s gaze felt damning, and he turned before he thought better of it. \u00a0He supposed it made sense for Thor to be staring\nat him as he was, scrutinizing him, but all he could glimpse in the other man\u2019s\neyes was grief. \u00a0And worry. \u00a0And <i>pity.</i> \u00a0Steve took another breath, turning back to\nthe shadows. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m fine. \u00a0Everythin\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt does not seem to be.\u201d \u00a0Steve felt more than saw Thor take a step\ncloser. \u00a0\u201cNor does it need to be.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve closed his eyes\nhelplessly. \u00a0How could he be so deluded\nto think he could hide anything? \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll\nbe okay.\u201d \u00a0His voice was hardly anything.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor didn\u2019t answer right away, and\nwhen he did, the words hurt. \u00a0\u201cIn time,\u201d\nhe offered quietly, \u201cand with help. \u00a0You\nseem very little like the man I knew four months ago.\u201d \u00a0Hearing someone else say that was beyond\npainful. \u00a0In a way, as stressful as it\nhad been being surrounded by these strangers, that had been a shield of sorts,\ntoo. \u00a0These people, whether it be the\nGuardians or the Nova Corpsmen or the Xandarian doctors, had never known them\nbefore Hell. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t see the\ncontrast, so it wasn\u2019t so obvious what had been changed. \u00a0What had been lost and damaged.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nBeing with Thor was direct\nevidence of all of that. \u00a0The last time\nSteve had talked to the God of Thunder had been right before the battle where\nhe and Tony had been kidnapped. \u00a0Thor had\nbeen bickering with Barton over some movie they\u2019d watched, and he\u2019d wanted\nSteve\u2019s opinion (and for that opinion to match his, of course). \u00a0Steve hadn\u2019t ever seen the movie in question,\nbut Thor had been loud and affectionate and cajoling, and they\u2019d all laughed\nlike good buddies. \u00a0That had been four\nmonths ago.</p><p><i>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nFour months.</i> \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been kidnapped. \u00a0Four months since\nthey\u2019d been to Earth, to New York. \u00a0Four\nmonths since he\u2019d been Captain America. \nIn reality, that wasn\u2019t much time at all, but in the pit? \u00a0In Hell? \nThe days had gone on and on. \u00a0A\nlifetime of them had passed painfully slowly, moment by moment with so much darkness\nand so little hope. \u00a0\u201cNot sure that I\nam,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nTo that Thor said nothing at\nfirst, and the hum of the ship was very loud. \nSteve could almost hear Tony softly and evenly breathing where the other\nman still slumbered in the bunk. \u00a0<i>At least he\u2019s asleep. \u00a0He\u2019s still sleeping.</i> \u00a0Steve shivered in relief, rubbing his arms\nthrough his shirt and bristling anew at how unpleasant his own touch was. \u00a0It was constant, this tickling under his skin\nlike an itch he could never scratch, throbbing in his muscles like pain he\ncouldn\u2019t massage away. \u00a0Tears stung his\neyes again. \u00a0God, he was pathetic.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor sighed. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know the particulars of what\nhappened. \u00a0I doubt anyone does, aside\nfrom you and Stark. \u00a0Still, I was told\nenough about your captivity that my imagination has no difficulty in providing\nthe details.\u201d \u00a0Steve closed his eyes\ntighter. \u201cThere is a reason that prisoners of the Kree rarely live to relay\ntheir tale. \u00a0I can see it you both, signs\nof the deepest suffering, and I am sorry, truly sorry, that I was not able to\nfind you time.\u201d \u00a0Thor\u2019s tone grew taut\nwith anger. \u00a0\u201cMy father\u2026 \u00a0He would not permit me to use Asgard\u2019s\nresources to search for you. \u00a0When it\nbecame obvious Earthen forces were not going to be nearly sufficient, I\nreturned home and beseeched him for aid. \nHe gave me none and forbid me to spend my time trying to find you. \u00a0I defied him, of course, but I wasted\nprecious weeks, and without Heimdall\u2019s aid\u2026\u201d \nSteve vaguely knew who that was. \nThor had mentioned him once or twice before. \u00a0Heimdall was his dear friend, the guardian of\nthe Bifrost, someone with the powerful, magical capability of seeing every soul\nin the galaxy. \u00a0 If Thor had had his\nhelp, if he\u2019d been able to find them right away, before they\u2019d been sold at the\nslave auction and brought to the moon\u2026</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Thor murmured again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve opened his eyes. \u00a0He didn\u2019t turn around. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even absolve Thor. \u00a0He probably should have, but he just didn\u2019t\nhave the strength. \u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d\nhe finally said as the silence dragged on. \nThat seemed so cruel, so final, and despite all the pain\u2026 \u00a0He just couldn\u2019t leave it that way. \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re lucky you found us. \u00a0Lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cIt is not luck that allowed you\nto survive.\u201d \u00a0To be honest, Steve didn\u2019t\nwant to hear this. \u00a0He knew what Thor was\ngoing to say, and he didn\u2019t want someone consoling him or telling him how\nstrong and brave they had been to live through what they had. \u00a0Maybe that was petty, because he\u2019d always\nbelieved in comforting those who needed it, and he definitely needed it. \u00a0It was that optimism that Tony had so often\ndetested down in the pit, that belief that fundamentally things were alright\nand people were decent and deserved a fair shake. \u00a0That an individual had the power to live a\ngood life and do the right thing no matter what. \u00a0Those beliefs had survived the worst horrors\nof humanity during the war.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nBut he hadn\u2019t <i>lived </i>that depravity in a sense. \nSure, he\u2019d seen it. \u00a0He\u2019d fought\nagainst it. \u00a0He\u2019d experienced it. \u00a0And, as a soldier, he\u2019d thought he understood\nit. \u00a0But he hadn\u2019t. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t been immersed in it with no escape. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t watched people tearing other people\napart for a morsel of food or a scrap of clothing or for <i>no</i> reason at all other than anger, sport, and bloodlust. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t been tortured, hadn\u2019t nearly been\nstarved to death, hadn\u2019t lived in filth and his own blood, hadn\u2019t been treated\nas nothing more than a slab of meat and made to work until he died. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t had to watch someone he cared for\ndeeply fall into depression and desperation, hadn\u2019t had to see him suffer with\nguilt, hadn\u2019t known at all what that was like. \nIt fucking <i>hurt.</i></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSo he didn\u2019t care about the platitudes\nhe figured Thor was going to offer. \u00a0It\nwas empty solace spoken by someone who had no idea what it was like to live like\nan animal, to cling to your humanity in a grimy pit of violence and misery\nwhere everything was reduced to its basest and worst form. \u00a0Thor had no <i>goddamn clue.</i></p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor was more perceptive that\nanyone gave him credit for, though. \u00a0\u201cIt\nis not my place to tell you how to feel. \nSurely coming back to us after what happened to you is jarring, to say\nthe least. \u00a0But I am certain you will\nfind no relief in solitude.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nAnger and pain rushed over Steve\nin a tidal wave, and he turned to glare at his teammate. \u00a0Thor shook his head and raised his hands in a\nnonthreatening show. \u00a0\u201cI mean no\ninsult. \u00a0It\u2019s merely an observation. \u00a0Stark\u2026 \nHe is far from who he was as well, but at least he seems to take solace\nin you. \u00a0In being close to you.\u201d \u00a0The corner of Thor\u2019s mouth turned upward in a\nsmall, rueful grin. \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s fairly\nsurprising, considering how poorly you two got along before you were lost. \u00a0You were hardly friends.\u201d \u00a0He considered that a moment. \u00a0\u201cThough I suppose it\u2019s not surprising,\nactually, when you think about it. \nTraumatic circumstances have been known to bond people together.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nIs that what had happened? \u00a0Considering the mess of everything, Steve\nwasn\u2019t certain. \u00a0His memories of their\nescape attempt were hazy at best. \u00a0He\ncould recall being stuck in that dark shard elevator as they\u2019d been brought\nback down to Hell. \u00a0He remembered Tony asking\nhim, no, <i>begging</i> him to kill them\nboth\u2026 \u00a0Obviously he hadn\u2019t done it. \u00a0He was pretty sure he\u2019d told Tony he loved\nhim, and he was pretty sure Tony had said he loved him back. \u00a0Didn\u2019t that mean something more than a bond born\nfrom traumatic circumstances? \u00a0Tony had\nmeant it, didn\u2019t he? \u00a0Steve had. \u00a0He\u2019d meant it with his whole heart. \u00a0Their experiences together in Hell hadn\u2019t simply\nbirthed their relationship. \u00a0It had shown\nthem both what had been there all along, what could have been if they\u2019d just\nlooked and given each other the chance.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nRight?</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThor sighed again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen you pull away from him numerous\ntimes since I arrived. \u00a0Like now. \u00a0He has been at your side constantly, but you\u2019ve\nflinched and withdrawn. \u00a0And it\u2019s not my\nplace to say\u2026 \u00a0I realize it\u2019s not. \u00a0But I fear for you and for him. \u00a0It\u2019s clear he needs you.\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cI know he does,\u201d Steve said,\nturning away again.</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u201cAnd you need him. \u00a0So why\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nSteve grimaced and dug his fingers\ninto his arm until the pain was nearly unbearable. \u00a0He didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \u00a0He <i>really\n</i>didn\u2019t. \u00a0But he\u2019d kept the pain\ninside for days and days, ever since he\u2019d become aware enough to realize how\nmuch he couldn\u2019t stand to be touched, ever since the venomous teeth of <i>what this meant </i>had dug into this heart\nand spread their poison. \u00a0It was\nimpossible to ignore or hide it now. \u00a0\u201cI\ncan\u2019t\u2026\u201d \u00a0His voice failed him, and he\nshivered, looking down and trying to gather himself. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t stand having him

&nbsp;Hearing someone else say that was beyond\npainful. &nbsp;In a way, as stressful as it\nhad been being surrounded by these strangers, that had been a shield of sorts,\ntoo. &nbsp;These people, whether it be the\nGuardians or the Nova Corpsmen or the Xandarian doctors, had never known them\nbefore Hell. &nbsp;They couldn&rsquo;t see the\ncontrast, so it wasn&rsquo;t so obvious what had been changed. &nbsp;What had been lost and damaged.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nBeing with Thor was direct\nevidence of all of that. &nbsp;The last time\nSteve had talked to the God of Thunder had been right before the battle where\nhe and Tony had been kidnapped. &nbsp;Thor had\nbeen bickering with Barton over some movie they&rsquo;d watched, and he&rsquo;d wanted\nSteve&rsquo;s opinion (and for that opinion to match his, of course). &nbsp;Steve hadn&rsquo;t ever seen the movie in question,\nbut Thor had been loud and affectionate and cajoling, and they&rsquo;d all laughed\nlike good buddies. &nbsp;That had been four\nmonths ago.</p><p><i>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nFour months.</i> &nbsp;Four months since\nthey&rsquo;d been kidnapped. &nbsp;Four months since\nthey&rsquo;d been to Earth, to New York. &nbsp;Four\nmonths since he&rsquo;d been Captain America. \nIn reality, that wasn&rsquo;t much time at all, but in the pit? &nbsp;In Hell? \nThe days had gone on and on. &nbsp;A\nlifetime of them had passed painfully slowly, moment by moment with so much darkness\nand so little hope. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not sure that I\nam,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nTo that Thor said nothing at\nfirst, and the hum of the ship was very loud. \nSteve could almost hear Tony softly and evenly breathing where the other\nman still slumbered in the bunk. &nbsp;<i>At least he&rsquo;s asleep. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s still sleeping.</i> &nbsp;Steve shivered in relief, rubbing his arms\nthrough his shirt and bristling anew at how unpleasant his own touch was. &nbsp;It was constant, this tickling under his skin\nlike an itch he could never scratch, throbbing in his muscles like pain he\ncouldn&rsquo;t massage away. &nbsp;Tears stung his\neyes again. &nbsp;God, he was pathetic.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nThor sighed. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the particulars of what\nhappened. &nbsp;I doubt anyone does, aside\nfrom you and Stark. &nbsp;Still, I was told\nenough about your captivity that my imagination has no difficulty in providing\nthe details.&rdquo; &nbsp;Steve closed his eyes\ntighter. &ldquo;There is a reason that prisoners of the Kree rarely live to relay\ntheir tale. &nbsp;I can see it you both, signs\nof the deepest suffering, and I am sorry, truly sorry, that I was not able to\nfind you time.&rdquo; &nbsp;Thor&rsquo;s tone grew taut\nwith anger. &nbsp;&ldquo;My father&hellip; &nbsp;He would not permit me to use Asgard&rsquo;s\nresources to search for you. &nbsp;When it\nbecame obvious Earthen forces were not going to be nearly sufficient, I\nreturned home and beseeched him for aid. \nHe gave me none and forbid me to spend my time trying to find you. &nbsp;I defied him, of course, but I wasted\nprecious weeks, and without Heimdall&rsquo;s aid&hellip;&rdquo; \nSteve vaguely knew who that was. \nThor had mentioned him once or twice before. &nbsp;Heimdall was his dear friend, the guardian of\nthe Bifrost, someone with the powerful, magical capability of seeing every soul\nin the galaxy. &nbsp; If Thor had had his\nhelp, if he&rsquo;d been able to find them right away, before they&rsquo;d been sold at the\nslave auction and brought to the moon&hellip;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Thor murmured again.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nSteve opened his eyes. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t turn around. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t even absolve Thor. &nbsp;He probably should have, but he just didn&rsquo;t\nhave the strength. &nbsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo;\nhe finally said as the silence dragged on. \nThat seemed so cruel, so final, and despite all the pain&hellip; &nbsp;He just couldn&rsquo;t leave it that way. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky you found us. &nbsp;Lucky to be alive.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n&ldquo;It is not luck that allowed you\nto survive.&rdquo; &nbsp;To be honest, Steve didn&rsquo;t\nwant to hear this. &nbsp;He knew what Thor was\ngoing to say, and he didn&rsquo;t want someone consoling him or telling him how\nstrong and brave they had been to live through what they had. &nbsp;Maybe that was petty, because he&rsquo;d always\nbelieved in comforting those who needed it, and he definitely needed it. &nbsp;It was that optimism that Tony had so often\ndetested down in the pit, that belief that fundamentally things were alright\nand people were decent and deserved a fair shake. &nbsp;That an individual had the power to live a\ngood life and do the right thing no matter what. &nbsp;Those beliefs had survived the worst horrors\nof humanity during the war.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nBut he hadn&rsquo;t <i>lived </i>that depravity in a sense. \nSure, he&rsquo;d seen it. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d fought\nagainst it. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d experienced it. &nbsp;And, as a soldier, he&rsquo;d thought he understood\nit. &nbsp;But he hadn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t been immersed in it with no escape. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t watched people tearing other people\napart for a morsel of food or a scrap of clothing or for <i>no</i> reason at all other than anger, sport, and bloodlust. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t been tortured, hadn&rsquo;t nearly been\nstarved to death, hadn&rsquo;t lived in filth and his own blood, hadn&rsquo;t been treated\nas nothing more than a slab of meat and made to work until he died. &nbsp;He hadn&rsquo;t had to watch someone he cared for\ndeeply fall into depression and desperation, hadn&rsquo;t had to see him suffer with\nguilt, hadn&rsquo;t known at all what that was like. \nIt fucking <i>hurt.</i></p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nSo he didn&rsquo;t care about the platitudes\nhe figured Thor was going to offer. &nbsp;It\nwas empty solace spoken by someone who had no idea what it was like to live like\nan animal, to cling to your humanity in a grimy pit of violence and misery\nwhere everything was reduced to its basest and worst form. &nbsp;Thor had no <i>goddamn clue.</i></p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nThor was more perceptive that\nanyone gave him credit for, though. &nbsp;&ldquo;It\nis not my place to tell you how to feel. \nSurely coming back to us after what happened to you is jarring, to say\nthe least. &nbsp;But I am certain you will\nfind no relief in solitude.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nAnger and pain rushed over Steve\nin a tidal wave, and he turned to glare at his teammate. &nbsp;Thor shook his head and raised his hands in a\nnonthreatening show. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean no\ninsult. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s merely an observation. &nbsp;Stark&hellip; \nHe is far from who he was as well, but at least he seems to take solace\nin you. &nbsp;In being close to you.&rdquo; &nbsp;The corner of Thor&rsquo;s mouth turned upward in a\nsmall, rueful grin. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fairly\nsurprising, considering how poorly you two got along before you were lost. &nbsp;You were hardly friends.&rdquo; &nbsp;He considered that a moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;Though I suppose it&rsquo;s not surprising,\nactually, when you think about it. \nTraumatic circumstances have been known to bond people together.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nIs that what had happened? &nbsp;Considering the mess of everything, Steve\nwasn&rsquo;t certain. &nbsp;His memories of their\nescape attempt were hazy at best. &nbsp;He\ncould recall being stuck in that dark shard elevator as they&rsquo;d been brought\nback down to Hell. &nbsp;He remembered Tony asking\nhim, no, <i>begging</i> him to kill them\nboth&hellip; &nbsp;Obviously he hadn&rsquo;t done it. &nbsp;He was pretty sure he&rsquo;d told Tony he loved\nhim, and he was pretty sure Tony had said he loved him back. &nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t that mean something more than a bond born\nfrom traumatic circumstances? &nbsp;Tony had\nmeant it, didn&rsquo;t he? &nbsp;Steve had. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d meant it with his whole heart. &nbsp;Their experiences together in Hell hadn&rsquo;t simply\nbirthed their relationship. &nbsp;It had shown\nthem both what had been there all along, what could have been if they&rsquo;d just\nlooked and given each other the chance.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nRight?</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nThor sighed again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you pull away from him numerous\ntimes since I arrived. &nbsp;Like now. &nbsp;He has been at your side constantly, but you&rsquo;ve\nflinched and withdrawn. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not my\nplace to say&hellip; &nbsp;I realize it&rsquo;s not. &nbsp;But I fear for you and for him. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s clear he needs you.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n&ldquo;I know he does,&rdquo; Steve said,\nturning away again.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n&ldquo;And you need him. &nbsp;So why&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nSteve grimaced and dug his fingers\ninto his arm until the pain was nearly unbearable. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it. &nbsp;He <i>really\n</i>didn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;But he&rsquo;d kept the pain\ninside for days and days, ever since he&rsquo;d become aware enough to realize how\nmuch he couldn&rsquo;t stand to be touched, ever since the venomous teeth of <i>what this meant </i>had dug into this heart\nand spread their poison. &nbsp;It was\nimpossible to ignore or hide it now. &nbsp;&ldquo;I\ncan&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;His voice failed him, and he\nshivered, looking down and trying to gather himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand having him close.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\n&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &nbsp;That was asked without judgment.</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \n\nSteve glanced over his shoulder at\nTony, who hadn&rsquo;t moved at all. &nbsp;Who was still\nsleeping. &nbsp;And, God, he wanted to go back\nto bed with him. &nbsp;He was still so tired,\nas if the fatigue had settled deep into his organs and bones and couldn&rsquo;t be\nexpunged no matter how much sleep he got. \nBut the thought of Tony holding onto him, of the nightmares gleefully\nhissing and dancing on edge of his consciousness&hellip; &nbsp;&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; he confessed. &nbsp;&ldquo;It hurts so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Catch up on <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/7469145/chapters/16973895\">AO3</a>!</p>",

How long do I have to last?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cJust until they get bored.\u201d Tony said as he stood up. \u201cGood luck, kid!\u201d He winked and walked out of the door. </p><p>The situation: Peter was tied in a chair. Arms up, legs out, in his spiderman suit. Bucky and Steve would come in and use any tactic they could to get Peter to reveal a secret code. This was just a test that every avenger had to go through. It just so happened to be Peters turn. He was in the middle of a room that had a one way window for Tony to watch him. There was one door and that was the only way out. </p><p>The door creaked open and Bucky and Steve walked in, shutting the door behind them. They walked over to where Peter was. Bucky crouched down. He pulled off Peters mask and threw it aside. He got into character. </p><p>\u201cSo, I understand that there\u2019s a code you need to tell us. What is it?\u201d He interrogated. Steve has to cover his mouth in order to stop his chuckle. Peter remained silent, staring intensly into Buckys eyes. </p><p>\u201cWe have ways of making you talk. I\u2019ll ask again, what\u2019s the code?\u201d He said, a bit more firm this time. Once again, Peter didn\u2019t say anything. Bucky sighed and stood up. He whispered to Steve for a few seconds before they turned their attention back to Peter. Steve walked over to Peters legs. He mouthed the word \u2018sorry\u2019 and he squeezed his thighs. Peter flinched almost so violently that the chair moved. Bucky grinned. </p><p>\u201cWell, well, well! Looks like someone\u2019s a bit ticklish.\u201d He teased as he slowly walked towards the boy. </p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you anything!\u201d Peter said. Bucky gave him a doubting look and a smug grin before he scratched under his arms. Peter bit his lip and closed his eyes. He arched his back to the best of his abilities but it didn\u2019t dampen the sensation. Steve watched as Bucky\u2019s fingers danced down to Peters ribs and that\u2019s where the spiderman lost it. </p><p>\u201cWaiaiait!\u201d He squealed. </p><p>\u201cPlanning on telling us that code?\u201d Bucky asked as he continued his attack. Peter shook his head, eyes shut, and beaming. Steve\u2019s fingers joined in too. He was squeezing at both of his thighs. Peters reactions would differ depending on certain spots they would tease, scratch, prod, poke, and squeeze. To Peter it was extremely embarrassing. He had two AVENGERS teasing and tickling him into a pile of mush. Not to mention that Tony freaking Stark was spectating through a window. He couldn\u2019t be more humiliated. Steve decided to switch spots and he moved up to Peters neck. This caused him to adorably try and bring up his shoulders to block out the sensation. With the way his arms were bound, it made it nearly impossible to block the neck tickles. He scrunched up his nose and his face turned even pinker than it had already been. Bucky moved down to spider at Parker\u2019s stomach. Seeing as that was his worst spot, he was hysteric. </p><p>\u201cI GIHIHIVE!\u201d He screamed. Bucky immediately took his hands off and Steve followed. </p><p>\u201cTell is the code.\u201d Bucky demanded, but he didn\u2019t look to threatening. He was fighting back a smile as he looked at the cute, blushy, panting pile of mush that was sitting before him. Peter didn\u2019t say anything. He just tried to catch his breath. Steve started lightly scratching behind his ears. </p><p>\u201cTell is the code.\u201d He sang teasingly. He was going for more of a good cop. </p><p>\u201c8567!\u201d Peter yelped. Both Bucky and Steve knew that wasn\u2019t the right code as Tony had told them what it was before hand. </p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Steve asked as he started moving his hand down to tickle his neck. </p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He screamed. \u201cNow let me go! I gave you what you want.\u201d Peter said. Steve and Bucky shared a glance and Steve let up. </p><p>\u201cOkay. Tony will be in to let you loose.\u201d Steve said, ruffling the boys hair. Steve made his way towards the door and Bucky gave one final scribble on Peters feet and left. Peter was a giggly mess and he desperately tried to regain the ability to breathe. Tony walked in with a proud smile on his face. </p><p>\u201cYou did it kid.\u201d He said enthusiastically. Peter simply smiled as he continued to pant. Tony walked over and started loosening his restraints. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I will forget about your little weakness. It\u2019s cute and could be extremely useful for me if I need to get you out of bed or something.\u201d Tony chuckled. As the bondages were released, Peter rubbed his wrists and his ankles. He stood up and grabbed his mask. </p><p>\u201cDo I ever get to do this again?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to- wait&hellip; did you say \u2018get\u2019? Hold on, did you like this?\u201d Tony beamed. Peter flushed. </p><p>\u201cI mean it was fun.\u201d He said, rubbing his neck. Before Tony could reply, Bucky popped his head into the room. </p><p>\u201cHey Tony! We need you.\u201d He called and he slipped away. Tony looked back at Peter, gave him a smile, and walked away. </p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>A/N</p><p>Wowowowoowow I love my boi</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I admit that I had to think long and hard on this one and, eventually, I ended up with some weird kind of dystopian arranged marriage AU? And it\u2019s not like Bucky will <i>die</i>\u00a0within twenty-four hours, but his life will certainly be forfeit within a not-to-distant future once those hours are up.</p><p>More below the cut!</p><!-- more --><p>The story is set in a world that\u2019s a little more technologically advanced than ours. Big parts of the planet has died and people now live in huge, sprawling cities, protected by high walls and various high-tech shields to keep the elements and pollution at bay. Due to how these cities are built (i.e. can\u2019t expand all that easily) the population has to be kept under control. This is done through various methods, like excellent birth control, a limit on children one family can produce, and a firm belief in monogamy and the sanctity of marriage. The one you marry, you stay with for life, because there\u2019s no room to go galavanting off and get kids left and right. The state also has a hand in approving marriages, to make sure that the best genes are preserved. This means that same-sex relationships are, in fact, quite common, since they don\u2019t result in children. But, of course, these couples\u2019 chances of adopting a child are extremely low. Only the rich can pay enough to buy one of the precious babies being allowed to be born each year.</p><p>ANYHOW. Like all true dystopian stories, this one has a dark side. Namely that those who aren\u2019t considered beneficial to society are, well, cast out. There are settlements huddled around on the outside of these cities, consisting of the sick, weak, and generally undesirable who have been discreetly shoved out the door. It\u2019s a harsh life since there\u2019s no protection to be had and very little food. More often than not, it\u2019s a death sentence (which, coincidentally, is also the most common punishment for murder, because no one wants to waste precious resources on criminals). There are laws in place to decide who gets to stay or not and, as you might have guessed, they are much harsher for the poor. Anyone who is sick, unmarried, and without a job are more likely to get kicked out.</p><p>Bucky is all three.</p><p>When he lost his arm four years ago it wasn\u2019t such a big deal at first. Lots of soldiers lose limbs and they\u2019re always given prosthetics to make sure they can keep working (soldiers are, after all, not growing on trees, either). Bucky is no exception. But then, about five months before his thirtieth birthday, he\u2019s suddenly not allowed to extend his contract and finds himself without a job and is given no explanation why. Bucky is a <i>good</i> soldier, but, apparently, the brass has decided he\u2019s not worth it anymore.</p><p>Bucky moves in with Steve and Peggy, no longer able to pay for his small one-room apartment, and he realises, quite suddenly, that he is literally months away from getting kicked out. People like him \u2014 those with a physical disability, no job, and no spouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 will be shown the door once they\u2019re past thirty. But, naturally, no one wants to give Bucky a job once they find that out. Why hire someone who is nearing their expiration date anyway? And it\u2019s not like he has anyone to marry, either, since he doesn\u2019t qualify for the programs set in place to help people find a suitable match.</p><p>So Bucky suddenly finds himself running out of options. Even Steve, who\u2019s been sickly for as long as they both can remember, is safe for now, since he married Peggy. Technically, the state disapproved of that match (Steve doesn\u2019t have very promising genes, they argued) but Peggy pulled enough strings and twisted enough arms to make it happen anyway. Because no one tells Peggy fucking Carter what to do.</p><p>Bucky is glad that Steve has a future, but he is admittedly worried about his own. He grows more and more desperate as the weeks past and, long before he\u2019s ready, his birthday arrives. Bucky knows they won\u2019t come for him until the day after, so he has twenty-four hours left before he\u2019s exiled. Both Peggy and Steve are, understandably, distraught while Bucky is mostly numb. He\u2019s done what he can to prepare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 bought supplies that will at least last a couple of weeks \u2014 but he knows that won\u2019t do much in the long run. Once he\u2019s outside the wall, his fate is sealed.</p><p>While he knows that he should spend his last day with his loved ones, he ends up drifting instead. Just walking along the streets, drinking in the city he\u2019s lived in his entire life but will never see again. All their grief and anger just makes his own panic spike. He will go back home before the evening, but, for now, he does what he wants.</p><p>Eventually, he ends up at a bar. He figures it\u2019s one of the last times he\u2019ll get to drink, so why not? It\u2019s not a nice place by any means, but the beer is acceptable and the music is good, so he doesn\u2019t complain.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s when he\u2019s just starting to get tipsy that someone bumps into him where he\u2019s sitting hunched over the bar. Bucky turns, annoyed, but the scathing reprimand dies on his lips when his gaze meets a pair of gorgeous brown eyes. The guy is probably a couple of years younger than Bucky but cute as hell with a charming smile and clothes worth more than Bucky\u2019s entire wardrobe. He\u2019s not entirely sure what the guy is doing there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 in that kind of bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nbut, from the moment their gazes meet, his entire focus shifts to Bucky in an extremely flattering way.</p><p>His name is Tony, Bucky learns.</p><p>Tony buys Bucky another drink and they get talking. Any other day, Bucky would have made an effort to flirt, but he\u2019s too tired to even try. He even says as much, when Tony seems bewildered at Bucky\u2019s lack of response to <i>his </i>flirting. Without really meaning to, Bucky ends up spilling his life\u2019s story to this virtual stranger, which feels both good and extremely embarrassing. The best part is that Tony genuinely listens, his face growing more and more solemn the more he hears. He asks questions, too, clearly appalled to hear that Bucky is going to kicked out tomorrow.</p><p>Tony is clearly too rich to have ever known someone who qualifies to get exiled.</p><p>Bucky shows his prosthetic and explains he can\u2019t get a job because of it and, unless someone is willing to marry him within the next eight or nine hours, there\u2019s just nothing to do about it. He tries to smile, but it\u2019s not a very comforting smile.</p><p>He knows he\u2019s going to die. He has come to terms with it, no matter how much it hurts. Tony, apparently, has other plans.</p><p>He proposes.</p><p>Bucky laughs it off at first, assuming it\u2019s a joke, but Tony shakes his head and just repeats the question. Bucky isn\u2019t sure how to react, but, for some reason, what he ends up doing is listing all the reasons why Tony <i>shouldn\u2019t </i>marry him. Tony just smiles and adds some of his own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 the fact that he\u2019s already engaged to be married to someone named Sunset Bain (the name tickles at the back of Bucky\u2019s memory but he can\u2019t quite place it), is expected to produce heirs at some point, and would probably give his mentor a heartattack if he suddenly showed up married \u2014 but says they don\u2019t matter.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky argues that they <i>do\n</i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 divorce isn\u2019t an option. Tony will be stuck with Bucky for life if they get married and he shouldn\u2019t have to do that just to save Bucky\u2019s life.\u00a0</p><p>Tony argues that there is no better reason. In their day and age, most marriages are arranged anyway, aided by the state and their algorithms and research, and Tony would much rather do something useful with his marriage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 like giving Bucky another chance at life.</p><p>Besides, they seem to like each other well enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 more than Tony likes his actual fianc\u00e9e. Bucky might actually be doing Tony a favour by marrying him. They can work out the details later.<br/></p><p>It\u2019s not like they\u2019re expected to <i>love </i>each other, but they can make it work.</p><p>It takes a lot of arguing before Bucky eventually agrees. Mostly because he realises that he\u2019s being an idiot, saying no to the one thing that can save him from certain death.

And it\u2019s not like Bucky will <i>die</i>\u00a0within twenty-four hours, but his life will certainly be forfeit within a not-to-distant future once those hours are up.</p><p>More below the cut!</p>[[MORE]]<p>The story is set in a world that\u2019s a little more technologically advanced than ours. Big parts of the planet has died and people now live in huge, sprawling cities, protected by high walls and various high-tech shields to keep the elements and pollution at bay. Due to how these cities are built (i.e. can\u2019t expand all that easily) the population has to be kept under control. This is done through various methods, like excellent birth control, a limit on children one family can produce, and a firm belief in monogamy and the sanctity of marriage. The one you marry, you stay with for life, because there\u2019s no room to go galavanting off and get kids left and right. The state also has a hand in approving marriages, to make sure that the best genes are preserved. This means that same-sex relationships are, in fact, quite common, since they don\u2019t result in children. But, of course, these couples\u2019 chances of adopting a child are extremely low. Only the rich can pay enough to buy one of the precious babies being allowed to be born each year.</p><p>ANYHOW. Like all true dystopian stories, this one has a dark side. Namely that those who aren\u2019t considered beneficial to society are, well, cast out. There are settlements huddled around on the outside of these cities, consisting of the sick, weak, and generally undesirable who have been discreetly shoved out the door. It\u2019s a harsh life since there\u2019s no protection to be had and very little food. More often than not, it\u2019s a death sentence (which, coincidentally, is also the most common punishment for murder, because no one wants to waste precious resources on criminals). There are laws in place to decide who gets to stay or not and, as you might have guessed, they are much harsher for the poor. Anyone who is sick, unmarried, and without a job are more likely to get kicked out.</p><p>Bucky is all three.</p><p>When he lost his arm four years ago it wasn\u2019t such a big deal at first. Lots of soldiers lose limbs and they\u2019re always given prosthetics to make sure they can keep working (soldiers are, after all, not growing on trees, either). Bucky is no exception. But then, about five months before his thirtieth birthday, he\u2019s suddenly not allowed to extend his contract and finds himself without a job and is given no explanation why. Bucky is a <i>good</i> soldier, but, apparently, the brass has decided he\u2019s not worth it anymore.</p><p>Bucky moves in with Steve and Peggy, no longer able to pay for his small one-room apartment, and he realises, quite suddenly, that he is literally months away from getting kicked out. People like him \u2014 those with a physical disability, no job, and no spouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 will be shown the door once they\u2019re past thirty. But, naturally, no one wants to give Bucky a job once they find that out. Why hire someone who is nearing their expiration date anyway? And it\u2019s not like he has anyone to marry, either, since he doesn\u2019t qualify for the programs set in place to help people find a suitable match.</p><p>So Bucky suddenly finds himself running out of options. Even Steve, who\u2019s been sickly for as long as they both can remember, is safe for now, since he married Peggy. Technically, the state disapproved of that match (Steve doesn\u2019t have very promising genes, they argued) but Peggy pulled enough strings and twisted enough arms to make it happen anyway. Because no one tells Peggy fucking Carter what to do.</p><p>Bucky is glad that Steve has a future, but he is admittedly worried about his own. He grows more and more desperate as the weeks past and, long before he\u2019s ready, his birthday arrives. Bucky knows they won\u2019t come for him until the day after, so he has twenty-four hours left before he\u2019s exiled. Both Peggy and Steve are, understandably, distraught while Bucky is mostly numb. He\u2019s done what he can to prepare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 bought supplies that will at least last a couple of weeks \u2014 but he knows that won\u2019t do much in the long run. Once he\u2019s outside the wall, his fate is sealed.</p><p>While he knows that he should spend his last day with his loved ones, he ends up drifting instead. Just walking along the streets, drinking in the city he\u2019s lived in his entire life but will never see again. All their grief and anger just makes his own panic spike. He will go back home before the evening, but, for now, he does what he wants.</p><p>Eventually, he ends up at a bar. He figures it\u2019s one of the last times he\u2019ll get to drink, so why not? It\u2019s not a nice place by any means, but the beer is acceptable and the music is good, so he doesn\u2019t complain.\u00a0</p><p>It\u2019s when he\u2019s just starting to get tipsy that someone bumps into him where he\u2019s sitting hunched over the bar. Bucky turns, annoyed, but the scathing reprimand dies on his lips when his gaze meets a pair of gorgeous brown eyes. The guy is probably a couple of years younger than Bucky but cute as hell with a charming smile and clothes worth more than Bucky\u2019s entire wardrobe. He\u2019s not entirely sure what the guy is doing there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 in that kind of bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nbut, from the moment their gazes meet, his entire focus shifts to Bucky in an extremely flattering way.</p><p>His name is Tony, Bucky learns.</p><p>Tony buys Bucky another drink and they get talking. Any other day, Bucky would have made an effort to flirt, but he\u2019s too tired to even try. He even says as much, when Tony seems bewildered at Bucky\u2019s lack of response to <i>his </i>flirting. Without really meaning to, Bucky ends up spilling his life\u2019s story to this virtual stranger, which feels both good and extremely embarrassing. The best part is that Tony genuinely listens, his face growing more and more solemn the more he hears. He asks questions, too, clearly appalled to hear that Bucky is going to kicked out tomorrow.</p><p>Tony is clearly too rich to have ever known someone who qualifies to get exiled.</p><p>Bucky shows his prosthetic and explains he can\u2019t get a job because of it and, unless someone is willing to marry him within the next eight or nine hours, there\u2019s just nothing to do about it. He tries to smile, but it\u2019s not a very comforting smile.</p><p>He knows he\u2019s going to die. He has come to terms with it, no matter how much it hurts. Tony, apparently, has other plans.</p><p>He proposes.</p><p>Bucky laughs it off at first, assuming it\u2019s a joke, but Tony shakes his head and just repeats the question. Bucky isn\u2019t sure how to react, but, for some reason, what he ends up doing is listing all the reasons why Tony <i>shouldn\u2019t </i>marry him. Tony just smiles and adds some of his own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 the fact that he\u2019s already engaged to be married to someone named Sunset Bain (the name tickles at the back of Bucky\u2019s memory but he can\u2019t quite place it), is expected to produce heirs at some point, and would probably give his mentor a heartattack if he suddenly showed up married \u2014 but says they don\u2019t matter.\u00a0</p><p>Bucky argues that they <i>do\n</i>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 divorce isn\u2019t an option. Tony will be stuck with Bucky for life if they get married and he shouldn\u2019t have to do that just to save Bucky\u2019s life.\u00a0</p><p>Tony argues that there is no better reason. In their day and age, most marriages are arranged anyway, aided by the state and their algorithms and research, and Tony would much rather do something useful with his marriage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 like giving Bucky another chance at life.</p><p>Besides, they seem to like each other well enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 more than Tony likes his actual fianc\u00e9e. Bucky might actually be doing Tony a favour by marrying him. They can work out the details later.<br></p><p>It\u2019s not like they\u2019re expected to <i>love </i>each other, but they can make it work.</p><p>It takes a lot of arguing before Bucky eventually agrees. Mostly because he realises that he\u2019s being an idiot, saying no to the one thing that can save him from certain death. Steve would never forgive him if he didn\u2019t try.</p><p>And that\u2019s how Bucky finds himself at the registration office just before closing, waiting for Steve and Peggy to arrive and serve as witnesses, while his future husband is bribing the clerk to allow their marriage to pass. According to whatever algorithm that decides compatability, they\u2019re a pretty bad match\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bucky is much too poor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 but Tony can apparently bypass that just by showing his identification.</p><p>Bucky knows that\u2019s probably a bad sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 or a really good one, he hasn\u2019t quite decided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 but it\u2019s also a problem for later.</p><p>By the time Peggy and Steve arrive, Bucky has gone past nervous and shock and settled for comfortably numb.

                "content": "<p>I admit that I had to think long and hard on this one and, eventually, I ended up with some weird kind of dystopian arranged marriage AU? And it&rsquo;s not like Bucky will <i>die</i>&nbsp;within twenty-four hours, but his life will certainly be forfeit within a not-to-distant future once those hours are up.</p><p>More below the cut!</p><p>The story is set in a world that&rsquo;s a little more technologically advanced than ours. Big parts of the planet has died and people now live in huge, sprawling cities, protected by high walls and various high-tech shields to keep the elements and pollution at bay. Due to how these cities are built (i.e. can&rsquo;t expand all that easily) the population has to be kept under control. This is done through various methods, like excellent birth control, a limit on children one family can produce, and a firm belief in monogamy and the sanctity of marriage. The one you marry, you stay with for life, because there&rsquo;s no room to go galavanting off and get kids left and right. The state also has a hand in approving marriages, to make sure that the best genes are preserved. This means that same-sex relationships are, in fact, quite common, since they don&rsquo;t result in children. But, of course, these couples&rsquo; chances of adopting a child are extremely low. Only the rich can pay enough to buy one of the precious babies being allowed to be born each year.</p><p>ANYHOW. Like all true dystopian stories, this one has a dark side. Namely that those who aren&rsquo;t considered beneficial to society are, well, cast out. There are settlements huddled around on the outside of these cities, consisting of the sick, weak, and generally undesirable who have been discreetly shoved out the door. It&rsquo;s a harsh life since there&rsquo;s no protection to be had and very little food. More often than not, it&rsquo;s a death sentence (which, coincidentally, is also the most common punishment for murder, because no one wants to waste precious resources on criminals). There are laws in place to decide who gets to stay or not and, as you might have guessed, they are much harsher for the poor. Anyone who is sick, unmarried, and without a job are more likely to get kicked out.</p><p>Bucky is all three.</p><p>When he lost his arm four years ago it wasn&rsquo;t such a big deal at first. Lots of soldiers lose limbs and they&rsquo;re always given prosthetics to make sure they can keep working (soldiers are, after all, not growing on trees, either). Bucky is no exception. But then, about five months before his thirtieth birthday, he&rsquo;s suddenly not allowed to extend his contract and finds himself without a job and is given no explanation why. Bucky is a <i>good</i> soldier, but, apparently, the brass has decided he&rsquo;s not worth it anymore.</p><p>Bucky moves in with Steve and Peggy, no longer able to pay for his small one-room apartment, and he realises, quite suddenly, that he is literally months away from getting kicked out. People like him &mdash; those with a physical disability, no job, and no spouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&mdash; will be shown the door once they&rsquo;re past thirty. But, naturally, no one wants to give Bucky a job once they find that out. Why hire someone who is nearing their expiration date anyway? And it&rsquo;s not like he has anyone to marry, either, since he doesn&rsquo;t qualify for the programs set in place to help people find a suitable match.</p><p>So Bucky suddenly finds himself running out of options. Even Steve, who&rsquo;s been sickly for as long as they both can remember, is safe for now, since he married Peggy. Technically, the state disapproved of that match (Steve doesn&rsquo;t have very promising genes, they argued) but Peggy pulled enough strings and twisted enough arms to make it happen anyway. Because no one tells Peggy fucking Carter what to do.</p><p>Bucky is glad that Steve has a future, but he is admittedly worried about his own. He grows more and more desperate as the weeks past and, long before he&rsquo;s ready, his birthday arrives. Bucky knows they won&rsquo;t come for him until the day after, so he has twenty-four hours left before he&rsquo;s exiled. Both Peggy and Steve are, understandably, distraught while Bucky is mostly numb. He&rsquo;s done what he can to prepare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&mdash; bought supplies that will at least last a couple of weeks &mdash; but he knows that won&rsquo;t do much in the long run. Once he&rsquo;s outside the wall, his fate is sealed.</p><p>While he knows that he should spend his last day with his loved ones, he ends up drifting instead. Just walking along the streets, drinking in the city he&rsquo;s lived in his entire life but will never see again. All their grief and anger just makes his own panic spike. He will go back home before the evening, but, for now, he does what he wants.</p><p>Eventually, he ends up at a bar. He figures it&rsquo;s one of the last times he&rsquo;ll get to drink, so why not? It&rsquo;s not a nice place by any means, but the beer is acceptable and the music is good, so he doesn&rsquo;t complain.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s when he&rsquo;s just starting to get tipsy that someone bumps into him where he&rsquo;s sitting hunched over the bar. Bucky turns, annoyed, but the scathing reprimand dies on his lips when his gaze meets a pair of gorgeous brown eyes. The guy is probably a couple of years younger than Bucky but cute as hell with a charming smile and clothes worth more than Bucky&rsquo;s entire wardrobe. He&rsquo;s not entirely sure what the guy is doing there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&mdash; in that kind of bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&mdash;\n\n\n\nbut, from the moment their gazes meet, his entire focus shifts to Bucky in an extremely flattering way.</p><p>His name is Tony, Bucky learns.</p><p>Tony buys Bucky another drink and they get talking. Any other day, Bucky would have made an effort to flirt, but he&rsquo;s too tired to even try. He even says as much, when Tony seems bewildered at Bucky&rsquo;s lack of response to <i>his </i>flirting. Without really meaning to, Bucky ends up spilling his life&rsquo;s story to this virtual stranger, which feels both good and extremely embarrassing. The best part is that Tony genuinely listens, his face growing more and more solemn the more he hears. He asks questions, too, clearly appalled to hear that Bucky is going to kicked out tomorrow.</p><p>Tony is clearly too rich to have ever known someone who qualifies to get exiled.</p><p>Bucky shows his prosthetic and explains he can&rsquo;t get a job because of it and, unless someone is willing to marry him within the next eight or nine hours, there&rsquo;s just nothing to do about it.
