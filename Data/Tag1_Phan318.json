Frankly if he was honest he wasn\u2019t the person that got out of his home just to spend some time in the nature. It wasn\u2019t his idea though, so he could always blame his sister for pushing him out of his comfort zone if the day turned out to be horrible. She had called just a couple of minutes ago and said that \u201cyou better be prepared when I arrive at the driveway\u201d. Her voice had been harsh, but he knew that she wanted what was best for him. Even if he refused to accept that maybe taking a step out of the front door was considered good for your health.</p><p>Phil had let his phone slide down into his back pocket and now his nimble fingers fidgeted with the zipper anxiously. He wouldn\u2019t be alone, so he couldn\u2019t be nervous to meet new people, strangers. Shouldn\u2019t, but in reality, he realised that his own little hibernation might\u2019ve costed him his only social skills he had had.</p><p>Just then he cocked his head up when a car honked outside his house. A small smile found its place on his pale face as he gripped the door handle and opened the door. Phil\u2019s sister had already climbed out of the car and unbuckled her seatbelt to run up to him and give him a long bone-crushing hug. As her head rested in the crook of his neck he could feel her breath tickle, when she spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s finally time little-brother for you to live a little\u201d. She then took a step back and eyed him up \u201cYou\u2019ve really gotten pale, like inhumanly pale, you look like death visiting his own funeral.\u201d Phil tried looking mad at what she had just proclaimed but the angry look melted of his face when he saw her smiling, lightly shaking her head. Though he managed a meek \u201chey\u201d and ruffled her short hair that almost looked strawberry blonde in the sun, but he knew better, really it was more of a reddish brown.</p><p>She held up her hands in defence \u201cI never said it didn\u2019t suit you, it goes well with your pitch-black hair\u201d. \u00a0Then she took his hand and dragged him towards the car. \u201cEnough banter, lets go\u201d. Phil wiggled out of her firm grip \u201cwait I just got to lock the door\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan had always been the type of person that most people overlooked. He had that kind of plain white guy look to him. With his brown hair, that he had for most of his life straightened but now let flow into ringlets. Dan himself said that if eyes really were the windows to your soul, then it wasn\u2019t that strange that his looked dead. As his main joke focused around how much not of a soul he had. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that weird that Dan didn\u2019t have that many friends\u2026</p><p>His best friend and co-worker Louise had sent him today\u2019s schedule over the phone, the phone that Dan so often could be seen holding on to. Dan was already up out of bed though and had taken one of the zip-lines today, he had just checked that it worked and was on his way to the next one. The first group was to arrive nine o\u2019clock and Dan might not have time to check all of the zip-line courses. Although it should be fine, they were checked once a week.</p><p>Dan secured himself and checked his harness then he gripped tightly around the holding-rod. He took a few steps back. The anticipation and fear were tugging at his stomach; Even if he had done this a hundred times. Then he closed his eyes and let go. What he felt first was the bubbly feeling in his stomach growing hotter and his heart beating even faster. He felt alive like the whole world belonged to him. When he cracked his eyes open the bright morning light almost shocked him once again. The view was as stunning as always. </p><p>Far down, underneath him he could see a small river, the fir forest reaching up to touch the sky all around him. The vegetation far down there, on the ground that humans set their feet on looked so luscious, thriving. He was distracted from all the fear now, to amazed once again, he always seems to forget how amazing it is. It reminds him of why he chose to work out here. Although funnily enough he\u2019s both scared of trees and moths. He blames it all on the blare witch project for keeping him away, cowering at his home for a whole week, refusing to work because he was too scared. Louise had come to his rescue and dragged him back to the beautiful forest.</p><p>He\u2019d just about landed when the alarm on his phone rang telling him he had about twenty minutes to get back to the entrance and gather the group. Normally it was some school class enjoying a class-only-day that they had gathered money for. But sometimes and only sometimes, there were office people who showed up. Some of them even had suits. Dan had to right out tell them to go change and that they had spare plain shirts with the parks logo on they could borrow. Never had he thought that boring old men and women would want to ride zip-lines with their colleagues. But apparently there was maybe - and emphasis on maybe - some part of them that still had a tad of childishness. Even if it felt highly unlikely.</p><p>There were of course regular groups with a blend of different people \u2013 young to old. Dan thinks that they\u2019re probably his favourite. He likes to teach the small children how to grip the rod and fasten their helmet and then look into their eyes and promise \u2013 on his whole career \u2013 that it absolutely will go fine and that they will enjoy the ride. And they trusted him, all of them. Maybe it was because the parents smiled so fondly when the child sought their parents eye contact for confirmation. Or it was the dimpled smile and quick light nod from Dan. Either way they all - for most of the time - enjoyed the ride even if they were a little bit scared.</p><p>When his phone rang again he checked what in the world it could be. It was of course Louise trying to FaceTime him. He answered with a slight smirk when he saw Louise\u2019s irritated look. \u201cDaniel Howell, where are you? You\u2019re supposed to be here in about fifteen minutes and you haven\u2019t even collected all the harnesses. \u00a0I\u2019ve already sorted out some of the supplies for you, you lazy oaf\u201d. </p><p>His smirk quickly turned into a frown \u201clook I\u2019m sorry Louise, I was checking the zip-lines, I was up so early that I kind of forgot the time. Thank you for doing that for me.\u201d Louise seemed to soften \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Dan up early? I thought you said that 3 am Wikipedia browsing were your middle name?\u201d Without waiting for an answer she continued. \u201dNow hurry your ass over here\u201d she barked out the last sentence but he didn\u2019t miss the large smile littering her face. Dan smiled to himself as he slipped his phone into the small pocket close to his chest.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil was in a deep debate about whether sandwiches were better with salad or without. Phil\u2019s sister only glared over at him from the driver\u2019s seat. She could only glower at him occasionally because she had to keep her eyes on the road. \u201cSalad only belongs in salads it has the same name even! Its not supposed to be crammed between two bread lumps and be called sandwich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle sis, clearly you don\u2019t know anything about the true art of sandwiches. I, the master sandwich maker has actually prepared one for each. And skilful as I am I noted that you despise salad and therefore I made one without and one with.\u201d Phil grinned at her and couldn\u2019t contain a laughter when she gave him a shocked stare then it changed to a sly look.</p><p>\u201cI see brother, what a gift you have. Then me putting a slice of cheese on both of our sandwiches for our starved tastebuds wouldn\u2019t bother you.\u201d Phil drew a gasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSis don\u2019t you dare\u201d he deadpanned. She only laughed \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019m not actually that cruel. Though I think you should test something new time to time.\u201d </p><p>Phil looked down at the map and grumbled \u201cI\u2019m lactose intolerant\u201d She stuck her tongue out, her eyes not leaving the road this time \u201cYes, but you wont die from testing it, your allergy isn\u2019t that bad, you just get bad in the stomach.\u201d He knew she was right but there was no way he was confirming that, so he stayed silent for the rest of the ride. They weren\u2019t actually arguing, the banter that was going on was playful. Phil couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d had the opportunity to hang out with someone let alone his own sister. </p><p>A loud happy shout cut him off in his thoughts and he looked up from the map. \u201cWhere here little brother! Finally, I can show you what I\u2019ve learned to love for the last couple of months.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHigh five\u201d Louise excitedly screamed when she saw him enter the small souvenir shop. He had just finished everything and had about five minutes before all the participants would show up. Louise had come up to him from behind the counter with a raised hand. \u201cLouise, thank you, I couldn\u2019t have done this without you, honestly I just finished what was left. Can I make it up for you?\u201d Louise\u2019s smile only grew. </p><p>She high-fived Dan and then said, \u201cWhat about you take me and Darcy to the cinema premiere of the new Disney movie?\u201d Dan smiled so that his nose wrinkled \u201cI\u2019d love to. Sunday?\u201d. She nodded and then grabbed his shoulders spinning him around so that he now faced the exit \u201churry on out now, your group is waiting on you\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil stood nervously with the group as the young guy explained the rules to them. He huddled close to his sister. It wasn\u2019t the fact that Phil hated strangers. No, he was just very uncomfortable when they stood so close. He grabbed his sisters hand and interlinked their hands. In an instant he felt so much safer. She looked over at him and gave him a reassuring smile. She knew just how hard this was for him. She even went out in her way to try to make him become a little more comfortable with it. </p><p>He studied the guide, he was handsome. With brown hair curling at the ends and eyes that shone when he spoke about \u2013 what Phil assumed was - his biggest hobby. He was about to slap himself in the face for even thinking it. But the guy in front of him reminded him of his ex. This was definitely not the right time to bring back those thoughts. He was supposed to forget them for fuck sake and yet he couldn\u2019t quite stop staring.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan was busy trying to catch everybody\u2019s attention. He\u2019d just explained how to fasten the harness and how to put it on. He\u2019d have to check everyone\u2019s when they were about to ride the zip-line anyway to make sure they\u2019d done it right. Especially the kids but there didn\u2019t seem to be any here so that made his job a little bit easier, even if children were about the cutest fucking thing ever.</p><p>While Dan passed out the colourful helmets \u2013 some orange, other purple and grey \u2013 he watched the group one, after one put them on. They looked like a couple of colourful eggs it was quite hilarious to be honest. Dan already had his own helmet on and they were walking towards the forest. The ladder up to the zip-line was located a small walking distance from where they were now, at the entrance.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t originally been this happy. He really felt like everything was right in his life. At first his parents had been disappointed in Dan when he threw away his education in law and chose this small branch in the wide education selection that he had had. It had been hard for them to accept it. Dan himself had felt betrayed like they truly didn\u2019t want him to be happy. It was a tough feeling to harbour. Sometimes it felt like he\u2019d swallowed a stone and it weighed him down. The sinking feeling in his stomach hadn\u2019t returned since he decided to ditch them and solely work with what really made him happy. </p><p>Along that long road he\u2019d made friends with Louise which had definitely enriched his life. When Louise and her husband got a baby, Dan often visited. It was a bit lonely without her at work too, so he said to himself that he had to see her. Dan had always wanted kids of his own too, something that he\u2019d proclaimed many times while he\u2019d sat at Louise\u2019s home helping Darcy putting beads on the fuse bead pegboard. Louise had smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be a great father\u201d.</p><p>The problem with that though was that Dan liked guys, don\u2019t misunderstand him, he likes girls too. Dan just tends to fall for guys much easier it seems. He\u2019s had one girlfriend before, Luna, at age 11. It hadn\u2019t been that serious probably due to their age. But Dan had liked to take her out to the movies and kiss her cheek. He didn\u2019t do that very often now, kiss somebody, anybody. Maybe Dan realised something was missing from his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil\u2019s sister dragged him after the guide. He\u2019d never really managed to catch the guides name and he didn\u2019t dare to ask for it. \u00a0When they were at the massive wooden ladder he gulped. But his sister seemed to radiate excitement, she pats his shoulder repeatedly and pointed up through the thick branches so that he \u2013 when he followed her arm with his gaze \u2013 saw the zip-line. </p><p>He tried to calm himself down, but to no avail. When suddenly the guide asked who wanted to go first his sister\u2019s hand flew up in the air. That wasn\u2019t the worst, his hand was linked with hers. Phil\u2019s eyes were wide, he looked terrified. </p><p>The guide nods his head and waves at them to follow him as he starts to climb up. Phil can\u2019t help but admire the way his muscles work. The view is even better when he starts climbing. His sister is climbing below him. She whispers to him to \u2018hurry-the-fuck-up\u2019 and he continues upwards, albeit a little faster than before.</p><p>Once they\u2019re up Phil stands huddled close to his sister as the guide grabs the hook. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t even have time to bat an eyelid before his sister takes a step forward. The guide gives her a dimpled smile and attaches the hook to the harness. He checks so that its fastened securely around her.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help but feel a tad bit of jealousy and he doesn\u2019t really know why. The guy is handsome, and he sure seems a lot nicer than Phil\u2019s ex. Phil swallows around the lump in his throat when he sees his own sister gain momentum. Fear tickles his stomach when its only him and the handsome guide left. He turns to Phil with a wicked smile and shining eyes \u201care you ready?\u201d. Phil nods meekly. He\u2019s sure he looks even paler than he did before.</p><p>\u201cOkay let me just check your harness.\u201d His fingers dance over the straps and Phil almost swears he can feel a fire igniting his skin even though it was just the graze of a fingertip. It takes longer for him to check Phil\u2019s harness than his sisters but when he\u2019s done he rises up again and laughs \u201cAll done!\u201d In the short time the guides hands where on him he\u2019d managed to forget what death-trap his sister had set him up to.</p><p>They guy takes the hook while chit-chatting to him \u201cI\u2019m sure your girlfriend will be happy to see you fly through the treetops like Tarzan, she seemed very eager. But don\u2019t worry our other guide is waiting there on the other side if you want to ask them anything.\u201d Phil chokes on his own spit. The guys eyes widen as he pats him on the back to help Phil regain his composure. Phil manages to get out \u201cshe\u2019s not my girlfriend. That\u2019s my sister.\u201d The guide takes a step back, a visible pink tint coating his cheeks. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for assuming\u201d he says holding up his hands in defence. \u201cNo worries\u201d Phil dismisses gently.</p><p>As Phil grips the rod and just lets himself \u201cenjoy\u201d the ride he finds himself watching the sky and the branches of the trees that seems so close.

He fucks up all his chances it seems. Why did he just assume that the guy had a girlfriend, it made Dan happy to know that it wasn\u2019t so, but it was still as embarrassing. Maybe the guy wasn\u2019t even interested in guys. You\u2019re not the centre of the worlds attention Dan, he reminded himself. </p><p>A sudden scream makes Dans eyes seek after its owner. He then sees it; the handsome guy is stuck in the middle of the zip line. Dan immediately freezes with fear. He knows how to handle this, he\u2019s been trained for this yet suddenly he felt weak to his knees. He\u2019d seen it happen before but had never done it before, himself.</p><p>Dan hooked the carabiner to the line. The gloves he has on his hands will prevent him from burning his hands. Dan took a deep breath and grasped the line then he started to monkey bar climbing his way towards the man. It felt like his arms were wobbly and he drew blood from his bottom lip that was securely wedged between his teeth. At the same time strangely enough, his heart fluttered. Maybe it was because of the thought that he would be able to talk to the man again. He felt a little bit like a hero in one of his childhood stories. Except that the heroes never seemed to be afraid and Dan was utterly terrified.</p><p>When Dan came closer he saw the mans face. His eyes wide and terrified he seemed to breathe loudly. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m by your side any moment now\u201d he reassured as he slowly inched himself closer. His face was scrunched up in a grimace. \u201cTell me your name, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked to try to calm down the anxious man. \u201cPhil\u201d the other man gasped out clearly wanting to get out of this situation immediately. \u201cOkay Phil I want you to remain calm and collected and when I reach to you let me handle the situation, don\u2019t try to cling to me, okay?\u201d.</p><p>As scared as he, himself was he didn\u2019t show it. He had to stay calm on the outside for Phil\u2019s sake, but for himself as well because if he let himself panic he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle this much longer.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil could feel him coming closer, the line juddered slightly. When he finally was by Phil\u2019s side he hooked onto Phil and started dragging them both backward. Steadily they moved back. The thing that had stuck to the line fell down. It seemed to be a branch.</p><p>When they were back to safety at the platform the guide stepped up on it and gripped Phil\u2019s hand. \u00a0Now the two of them stood on solid ground. The guide unhooked them both and they stepped away from the abyss. He exhaled with relief happy that he was safe. Then his eyes set on the guy in front of him. When he saw that the guide was smiling, he realised that he, himself was grinning dumbly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of my saviour?\u201d Phil asked curiously. They stood close and Phil\u2019s heart did a little flippy thing.</p><p>The guy only grinned back showing the whites of his teeth. \u201cDan\u201d \u201cHi Dan, thank you for saving me, is there anyway I can make it up to you?\u201d Phil asked a small smile on his soft pink lips. </p><p>Dan\u2019s gaze slowly drifted down to Phil\u2019s lips and he bit his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know you tell me, how would you make it up to me?\u201d Dan asked and now he was looking into Phil\u2019s eyes again. \u201cHow about a coffee date\u2026?\u201d Phil said nervously. \u201cWhat about a kiss first?\u201d Dan said smugly. Reaching up and placing a soft hand on Phil\u2019s cheek, his thumb drifting along Phil\u2019s jawline. Phil gulped and whispered \u201cplease\u201d. So, Dan reached out his other hand and very gently cupped Phil\u2019s cheeks. His fingers smooth and tender, igniting Phil\u2019s whole body. He slowly leaned in. When his lips met Phil\u2019s, they were soft and gentle. </p><p>Phil could stay like this forever, this could be the beginning of something new, something great. And Dan was suddenly sure that this was exactly what he had been missing.</p>",

Frankly if he was honest he wasn\u2019t the person that got out of his home just to spend some time in the nature. It wasn\u2019t his idea though, so he could always blame his sister for pushing him out of his comfort zone if the day turned out to be horrible. She had called just a couple of minutes ago and said that \u201cyou better be prepared when I arrive at the driveway\u201d. Her voice had been harsh, but he knew that she wanted what was best for him. Even if he refused to accept that maybe taking a step out of the front door was considered good for your health.</p><p>Phil had let his phone slide down into his back pocket and now his nimble fingers fidgeted with the zipper anxiously. He wouldn\u2019t be alone, so he couldn\u2019t be nervous to meet new people, strangers. Shouldn\u2019t, but in reality, he realised that his own little hibernation might\u2019ve costed him his only social skills he had had.</p><p>Just then he cocked his head up when a car honked outside his house. A small smile found its place on his pale face as he gripped the door handle and opened the door. Phil\u2019s sister had already climbed out of the car and unbuckled her seatbelt to run up to him and give him a long bone-crushing hug. As her head rested in the crook of his neck he could feel her breath tickle, when she spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s finally time little-brother for you to live a little\u201d. She then took a step back and eyed him up \u201cYou\u2019ve really gotten pale, like inhumanly pale, you look like death visiting his own funeral.\u201d Phil tried looking mad at what she had just proclaimed but the angry look melted of his face when he saw her smiling, lightly shaking her head. Though he managed a meek \u201chey\u201d and ruffled her short hair that almost looked strawberry blonde in the sun, but he knew better, really it was more of a reddish brown.</p><p>She held up her hands in defence \u201cI never said it didn\u2019t suit you, it goes well with your pitch-black hair\u201d. \u00a0Then she took his hand and dragged him towards the car. \u201cEnough banter, lets go\u201d. Phil wiggled out of her firm grip \u201cwait I just got to lock the door\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan had always been the type of person that most people overlooked. He had that kind of plain white guy look to him. With his brown hair, that he had for most of his life straightened but now let flow into ringlets. Dan himself said that if eyes really were the windows to your soul, then it wasn\u2019t that strange that his looked dead. As his main joke focused around how much not of a soul he had. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that weird that Dan didn\u2019t have that many friends\u2026</p><p>His best friend and co-worker Louise had sent him today\u2019s schedule over the phone, the phone that Dan so often could be seen holding on to. Dan was already up out of bed though and had taken one of the zip-lines today, he had just checked that it worked and was on his way to the next one. The first group was to arrive nine o\u2019clock and Dan might not have time to check all of the zip-line courses. Although it should be fine, they were checked once a week.</p><p>Dan secured himself and checked his harness then he gripped tightly around the holding-rod. He took a few steps back. The anticipation and fear were tugging at his stomach; Even if he had done this a hundred times. Then he closed his eyes and let go. What he felt first was the bubbly feeling in his stomach growing hotter and his heart beating even faster. He felt alive like the whole world belonged to him. When he cracked his eyes open the bright morning light almost shocked him once again. The view was as stunning as always. </p><p>Far down, underneath him he could see a small river, the fir forest reaching up to touch the sky all around him. The vegetation far down there, on the ground that humans set their feet on looked so luscious, thriving. He was distracted from all the fear now, to amazed once again, he always seems to forget how amazing it is. It reminds him of why he chose to work out here. Although funnily enough he\u2019s both scared of trees and moths. He blames it all on the blare witch project for keeping him away, cowering at his home for a whole week, refusing to work because he was too scared. Louise had come to his rescue and dragged him back to the beautiful forest.</p><p>He\u2019d just about landed when the alarm on his phone rang telling him he had about twenty minutes to get back to the entrance and gather the group. Normally it was some school class enjoying a class-only-day that they had gathered money for. But sometimes and only sometimes, there were office people who showed up. Some of them even had suits. Dan had to right out tell them to go change and that they had spare plain shirts with the parks logo on they could borrow. Never had he thought that boring old men and women would want to ride zip-lines with their colleagues. But apparently there was maybe - and emphasis on maybe - some part of them that still had a tad of childishness. Even if it felt highly unlikely.</p><p>There were of course regular groups with a blend of different people \u2013 young to old. Dan thinks that they\u2019re probably his favourite. He likes to teach the small children how to grip the rod and fasten their helmet and then look into their eyes and promise \u2013 on his whole career \u2013 that it absolutely will go fine and that they will enjoy the ride. And they trusted him, all of them. Maybe it was because the parents smiled so fondly when the child sought their parents eye contact for confirmation. Or it was the dimpled smile and quick light nod from Dan. Either way they all - for most of the time - enjoyed the ride even if they were a little bit scared.</p><p>When his phone rang again he checked what in the world it could be. It was of course Louise trying to FaceTime him. He answered with a slight smirk when he saw Louise\u2019s irritated look. \u201cDaniel Howell, where are you? You\u2019re supposed to be here in about fifteen minutes and you haven\u2019t even collected all the harnesses. \u00a0I\u2019ve already sorted out some of the supplies for you, you lazy oaf\u201d. </p><p>His smirk quickly turned into a frown \u201clook I\u2019m sorry Louise, I was checking the zip-lines, I was up so early that I kind of forgot the time. Thank you for doing that for me.\u201d Louise seemed to soften \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Dan up early? I thought you said that 3 am Wikipedia browsing were your middle name?\u201d Without waiting for an answer she continued. \u201dNow hurry your ass over here\u201d she barked out the last sentence but he didn\u2019t miss the large smile littering her face. Dan smiled to himself as he slipped his phone into the small pocket close to his chest.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil was in a deep debate about whether sandwiches were better with salad or without. Phil\u2019s sister only glared over at him from the driver\u2019s seat. She could only glower at him occasionally because she had to keep her eyes on the road. \u201cSalad only belongs in salads it has the same name even! Its not supposed to be crammed between two bread lumps and be called sandwich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle sis, clearly you don\u2019t know anything about the true art of sandwiches. I, the master sandwich maker has actually prepared one for each. And skilful as I am I noted that you despise salad and therefore I made one without and one with.\u201d Phil grinned at her and couldn\u2019t contain a laughter when she gave him a shocked stare then it changed to a sly look.</p><p>\u201cI see brother, what a gift you have. Then me putting a slice of cheese on both of our sandwiches for our starved tastebuds wouldn\u2019t bother you.\u201d Phil drew a gasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSis don\u2019t you dare\u201d he deadpanned. She only laughed \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019m not actually that cruel. Though I think you should test something new time to time.\u201d </p><p>Phil looked down at the map and grumbled \u201cI\u2019m lactose intolerant\u201d She stuck her tongue out, her eyes not leaving the road this time \u201cYes, but you wont die from testing it, your allergy isn\u2019t that bad, you just get bad in the stomach.\u201d He knew she was right but there was no way he was confirming that, so he stayed silent for the rest of the ride. They weren\u2019t actually arguing, the banter that was going on was playful. Phil couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d had the opportunity to hang out with someone let alone his own sister. </p><p>A loud happy shout cut him off in his thoughts and he looked up from the map. \u201cWhere here little brother! Finally, I can show you what I\u2019ve learned to love for the last couple of months.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHigh five\u201d Louise excitedly screamed when she saw him enter the small souvenir shop. He had just finished everything and had about five minutes before all the participants would show up. Louise had come up to him from behind the counter with a raised hand. \u201cLouise, thank you, I couldn\u2019t have done this without you, honestly I just finished what was left. Can I make it up for you?\u201d Louise\u2019s smile only grew. </p><p>She high-fived Dan and then said, \u201cWhat about you take me and Darcy to the cinema premiere of the new Disney movie?\u201d Dan smiled so that his nose wrinkled \u201cI\u2019d love to. Sunday?\u201d. She nodded and then grabbed his shoulders spinning him around so that he now faced the exit \u201churry on out now, your group is waiting on you\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil stood nervously with the group as the young guy explained the rules to them. He huddled close to his sister. It wasn\u2019t the fact that Phil hated strangers. No, he was just very uncomfortable when they stood so close. He grabbed his sisters hand and interlinked their hands. In an instant he felt so much safer. She looked over at him and gave him a reassuring smile. She knew just how hard this was for him. She even went out in her way to try to make him become a little more comfortable with it. </p><p>He studied the guide, he was handsome. With brown hair curling at the ends and eyes that shone when he spoke about \u2013 what Phil assumed was - his biggest hobby. He was about to slap himself in the face for even thinking it. But the guy in front of him reminded him of his ex. This was definitely not the right time to bring back those thoughts. He was supposed to forget them for fuck sake and yet he couldn\u2019t quite stop staring.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan was busy trying to catch everybody\u2019s attention. He\u2019d just explained how to fasten the harness and how to put it on. He\u2019d have to check everyone\u2019s when they were about to ride the zip-line anyway to make sure they\u2019d done it right. Especially the kids but there didn\u2019t seem to be any here so that made his job a little bit easier, even if children were about the cutest fucking thing ever.</p><p>While Dan passed out the colourful helmets \u2013 some orange, other purple and grey \u2013 he watched the group one, after one put them on. They looked like a couple of colourful eggs it was quite hilarious to be honest. Dan already had his own helmet on and they were walking towards the forest. The ladder up to the zip-line was located a small walking distance from where they were now, at the entrance.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t originally been this happy. He really felt like everything was right in his life. At first his parents had been disappointed in Dan when he threw away his education in law and chose this small branch in the wide education selection that he had had. It had been hard for them to accept it. Dan himself had felt betrayed like they truly didn\u2019t want him to be happy. It was a tough feeling to harbour. Sometimes it felt like he\u2019d swallowed a stone and it weighed him down. The sinking feeling in his stomach hadn\u2019t returned since he decided to ditch them and solely work with what really made him happy. </p><p>Along that long road he\u2019d made friends with Louise which had definitely enriched his life. When Louise and her husband got a baby, Dan often visited. It was a bit lonely without her at work too, so he said to himself that he had to see her. Dan had always wanted kids of his own too, something that he\u2019d proclaimed many times while he\u2019d sat at Louise\u2019s home helping Darcy putting beads on the fuse bead pegboard. Louise had smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be a great father\u201d.</p><p>The problem with that though was that Dan liked guys, don\u2019t misunderstand him, he likes girls too. Dan just tends to fall for guys much easier it seems. He\u2019s had one girlfriend before, Luna, at age 11. It hadn\u2019t been that serious probably due to their age. But Dan had liked to take her out to the movies and kiss her cheek. He didn\u2019t do that very often now, kiss somebody, anybody. Maybe Dan realised something was missing from his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil\u2019s sister dragged him after the guide. He\u2019d never really managed to catch the guides name and he didn\u2019t dare to ask for it. \u00a0When they were at the massive wooden ladder he gulped. But his sister seemed to radiate excitement, she pats his shoulder repeatedly and pointed up through the thick branches so that he \u2013 when he followed her arm with his gaze \u2013 saw the zip-line. </p><p>He tried to calm himself down, but to no avail. When suddenly the guide asked who wanted to go first his sister\u2019s hand flew up in the air. That wasn\u2019t the worst, his hand was linked with hers. Phil\u2019s eyes were wide, he looked terrified. </p><p>The guide nods his head and waves at them to follow him as he starts to climb up. Phil can\u2019t help but admire the way his muscles work. The view is even better when he starts climbing. His sister is climbing below him. She whispers to him to \u2018hurry-the-fuck-up\u2019 and he continues upwards, albeit a little faster than before.</p><p>Once they\u2019re up Phil stands huddled close to his sister as the guide grabs the hook. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t even have time to bat an eyelid before his sister takes a step forward. The guide gives her a dimpled smile and attaches the hook to the harness. He checks so that its fastened securely around her.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help but feel a tad bit of jealousy and he doesn\u2019t really know why. The guy is handsome, and he sure seems a lot nicer than Phil\u2019s ex. Phil swallows around the lump in his throat when he sees his own sister gain momentum. Fear tickles his stomach when its only him and the handsome guide left. He turns to Phil with a wicked smile and shining eyes \u201care you ready?\u201d. Phil nods meekly. He\u2019s sure he looks even paler than he did before.</p><p>\u201cOkay let me just check your harness.\u201d His fingers dance over the straps and Phil almost swears he can feel a fire igniting his skin even though it was just the graze of a fingertip. It takes longer for him to check Phil\u2019s harness than his sisters but when he\u2019s done he rises up again and laughs \u201cAll done!\u201d In the short time the guides hands where on him he\u2019d managed to forget what death-trap his sister had set him up to.</p><p>They guy takes the hook while chit-chatting to him \u201cI\u2019m sure your girlfriend will be happy to see you fly through the treetops like Tarzan, she seemed very eager. But don\u2019t worry our other guide is waiting there on the other side if you want to ask them anything.\u201d Phil chokes on his own spit. The guys eyes widen as he pats him on the back to help Phil regain his composure. Phil manages to get out \u201cshe\u2019s not my girlfriend. That\u2019s my sister.\u201d The guide takes a step back, a visible pink tint coating his cheeks. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for assuming\u201d he says holding up his hands in defence. \u201cNo worries\u201d Phil dismisses gently.</p><p>As Phil grips the rod and just lets himself \u201cenjoy\u201d the ride he finds himself watching the sky and the branches of the trees that seems so close. But suddenly something seems to fall onto the line before him he doesn\u2019t even have time to stop the scream erupting from him, before he comes to stop. Rocking back and forth from the hook attached to his harness. In the panic he let go of the rod but now he reaches to grab it once more. He can feel the panic rise. \u00a0How will he get out of this situation?</p><p>-</p><p>Dan can see the pretty guy get smaller and smaller as he moves across the gap. He fucks up all his chances it seems. Why did he just assume that the guy had a girlfriend, it made Dan happy to know that it wasn\u2019t so, but it was still as embarrassing. Maybe the guy wasn\u2019t even interested in guys. You\u2019re not the centre of the worlds attention Dan, he reminded himself. </p><p>A sudden scream makes Dans eyes seek after its owner. He then sees it; the handsome guy is stuck in the middle of the zip line. Dan immediately freezes with fear. He knows how to handle this, he\u2019s been trained for this yet suddenly he felt weak to his knees. He\u2019d seen it happen before but had never done it before, himself.</p><p>Dan hooked the carabiner to the line. The gloves he has on his hands will prevent him from burning his hands. Dan took a deep breath and grasped the line then he started to monkey bar climbing his way towards the man. It felt like his arms were wobbly and he drew blood from his bottom lip that was securely wedged between his teeth. At the same time strangely enough, his heart fluttered. Maybe it was because of the thought that he would be able to talk to the man again. He felt a little bit like a hero in one of his childhood stories. Except that the heroes never seemed to be afraid and Dan was utterly terrified.</p><p>When Dan came closer he saw the mans face. His eyes wide and terrified he seemed to breathe loudly. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m by your side any moment now\u201d he reassured as he slowly inched himself closer. His face was scrunched up in a grimace. \u201cTell me your name, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked to try to calm down the anxious man. \u201cPhil\u201d the other man gasped out clearly wanting to get out of this situation immediately. \u201cOkay Phil I want you to remain calm and collected and when I reach to you let me handle the situation, don\u2019t try to cling to me, okay?\u201d.</p><p>As scared as he, himself was he didn\u2019t show it. He had to stay calm on the outside for Phil\u2019s sake, but for himself as well because if he let himself panic he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle this much longer.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil could feel him coming closer, the line juddered slightly. When he finally was by Phil\u2019s side he hooked onto Phil and started dragging them both backward. Steadily they moved back. The thing that had stuck to the line fell down.

Frankly if he was honest he wasn\u2019t the person that got out of his home just to spend some time in the nature. It wasn\u2019t his idea though, so he could always blame his sister for pushing him out of his comfort zone if the day turned out to be horrible. She had called just a couple of minutes ago and said that \u201cyou better be prepared when I arrive at the driveway\u201d. Her voice had been harsh, but he knew that she wanted what was best for him. Even if he refused to accept that maybe taking a step out of the front door was considered good for your health.</p><p>Phil had let his phone slide down into his back pocket and now his nimble fingers fidgeted with the zipper anxiously. He wouldn\u2019t be alone, so he couldn\u2019t be nervous to meet new people, strangers. Shouldn\u2019t, but in reality, he realised that his own little hibernation might\u2019ve costed him his only social skills he had had.</p><p>Just then he cocked his head up when a car honked outside his house. A small smile found its place on his pale face as he gripped the door handle and opened the door. Phil\u2019s sister had already climbed out of the car and unbuckled her seatbelt to run up to him and give him a long bone-crushing hug. As her head rested in the crook of his neck he could feel her breath tickle, when she spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s finally time little-brother for you to live a little\u201d. She then took a step back and eyed him up \u201cYou\u2019ve really gotten pale, like inhumanly pale, you look like death visiting his own funeral.\u201d Phil tried looking mad at what she had just proclaimed but the angry look melted of his face when he saw her smiling, lightly shaking her head. Though he managed a meek \u201chey\u201d and ruffled her short hair that almost looked strawberry blonde in the sun, but he knew better, really it was more of a reddish brown.</p><p>She held up her hands in defence \u201cI never said it didn\u2019t suit you, it goes well with your pitch-black hair\u201d. \u00a0Then she took his hand and dragged him towards the car. \u201cEnough banter, lets go\u201d. Phil wiggled out of her firm grip \u201cwait I just got to lock the door\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan had always been the type of person that most people overlooked. He had that kind of plain white guy look to him. With his brown hair, that he had for most of his life straightened but now let flow into ringlets. Dan himself said that if eyes really were the windows to your soul, then it wasn\u2019t that strange that his looked dead. As his main joke focused around how much not of a soul he had. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that weird that Dan didn\u2019t have that many friends\u2026</p><p>His best friend and co-worker Louise had sent him today\u2019s schedule over the phone, the phone that Dan so often could be seen holding on to. Dan was already up out of bed though and had taken one of the zip-lines today, he had just checked that it worked and was on his way to the next one. The first group was to arrive nine o\u2019clock and Dan might not have time to check all of the zip-line courses. Although it should be fine, they were checked once a week.</p><p>Dan secured himself and checked his harness then he gripped tightly around the holding-rod. He took a few steps back. The anticipation and fear were tugging at his stomach; Even if he had done this a hundred times. Then he closed his eyes and let go. What he felt first was the bubbly feeling in his stomach growing hotter and his heart beating even faster. He felt alive like the whole world belonged to him. When he cracked his eyes open the bright morning light almost shocked him once again. The view was as stunning as always. </p><p>Far down, underneath him he could see a small river, the fir forest reaching up to touch the sky all around him. The vegetation far down there, on the ground that humans set their feet on looked so luscious, thriving. He was distracted from all the fear now, to amazed once again, he always seems to forget how amazing it is. It reminds him of why he chose to work out here. Although funnily enough he\u2019s both scared of trees and moths. He blames it all on the blare witch project for keeping him away, cowering at his home for a whole week, refusing to work because he was too scared. Louise had come to his rescue and dragged him back to the beautiful forest.</p><p>He\u2019d just about landed when the alarm on his phone rang telling him he had about twenty minutes to get back to the entrance and gather the group. Normally it was some school class enjoying a class-only-day that they had gathered money for. But sometimes and only sometimes, there were office people who showed up. Some of them even had suits. Dan had to right out tell them to go change and that they had spare plain shirts with the parks logo on they could borrow. Never had he thought that boring old men and women would want to ride zip-lines with their colleagues. But apparently there was maybe - and emphasis on maybe - some part of them that still had a tad of childishness. Even if it felt highly unlikely.</p><p>There were of course regular groups with a blend of different people \u2013 young to old. Dan thinks that they\u2019re probably his favourite. He likes to teach the small children how to grip the rod and fasten their helmet and then look into their eyes and promise \u2013 on his whole career \u2013 that it absolutely will go fine and that they will enjoy the ride. And they trusted him, all of them. Maybe it was because the parents smiled so fondly when the child sought their parents eye contact for confirmation. Or it was the dimpled smile and quick light nod from Dan. Either way they all - for most of the time - enjoyed the ride even if they were a little bit scared.</p><p>When his phone rang again he checked what in the world it could be. It was of course Louise trying to FaceTime him. He answered with a slight smirk when he saw Louise\u2019s irritated look. \u201cDaniel Howell, where are you? You\u2019re supposed to be here in about fifteen minutes and you haven\u2019t even collected all the harnesses. \u00a0I\u2019ve already sorted out some of the supplies for you, you lazy oaf\u201d. </p><p>His smirk quickly turned into a frown \u201clook I\u2019m sorry Louise, I was checking the zip-lines, I was up so early that I kind of forgot the time. Thank you for doing that for me.\u201d Louise seemed to soften \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Dan up early? I thought you said that 3 am Wikipedia browsing were your middle name?\u201d Without waiting for an answer she continued. \u201dNow hurry your ass over here\u201d she barked out the last sentence but he didn\u2019t miss the large smile littering her face. Dan smiled to himself as he slipped his phone into the small pocket close to his chest.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil was in a deep debate about whether sandwiches were better with salad or without. Phil\u2019s sister only glared over at him from the driver\u2019s seat. She could only glower at him occasionally because she had to keep her eyes on the road. \u201cSalad only belongs in salads it has the same name even! Its not supposed to be crammed between two bread lumps and be called sandwich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLittle sis, clearly you don\u2019t know anything about the true art of sandwiches. I, the master sandwich maker has actually prepared one for each. And skilful as I am I noted that you despise salad and therefore I made one without and one with.\u201d Phil grinned at her and couldn\u2019t contain a laughter when she gave him a shocked stare then it changed to a sly look.</p><p>\u201cI see brother, what a gift you have. Then me putting a slice of cheese on both of our sandwiches for our starved tastebuds wouldn\u2019t bother you.\u201d Phil drew a gasp.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSis don\u2019t you dare\u201d he deadpanned. She only laughed \u201cdon\u2019t worry I\u2019m not actually that cruel. Though I think you should test something new time to time.\u201d </p><p>Phil looked down at the map and grumbled \u201cI\u2019m lactose intolerant\u201d She stuck her tongue out, her eyes not leaving the road this time \u201cYes, but you wont die from testing it, your allergy isn\u2019t that bad, you just get bad in the stomach.\u201d He knew she was right but there was no way he was confirming that, so he stayed silent for the rest of the ride. They weren\u2019t actually arguing, the banter that was going on was playful. Phil couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d had the opportunity to hang out with someone let alone his own sister. </p><p>A loud happy shout cut him off in his thoughts and he looked up from the map. \u201cWhere here little brother! Finally, I can show you what I\u2019ve learned to love for the last couple of months.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cHigh five\u201d Louise excitedly screamed when she saw him enter the small souvenir shop. He had just finished everything and had about five minutes before all the participants would show up. Louise had come up to him from behind the counter with a raised hand. \u201cLouise, thank you, I couldn\u2019t have done this without you, honestly I just finished what was left. Can I make it up for you?\u201d Louise\u2019s smile only grew. </p><p>She high-fived Dan and then said, \u201cWhat about you take me and Darcy to the cinema premiere of the new Disney movie?\u201d Dan smiled so that his nose wrinkled \u201cI\u2019d love to. Sunday?\u201d. She nodded and then grabbed his shoulders spinning him around so that he now faced the exit \u201churry on out now, your group is waiting on you\u201d.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil stood nervously with the group as the young guy explained the rules to them. He huddled close to his sister. It wasn\u2019t the fact that Phil hated strangers. No, he was just very uncomfortable when they stood so close. He grabbed his sisters hand and interlinked their hands. In an instant he felt so much safer. She looked over at him and gave him a reassuring smile. She knew just how hard this was for him. She even went out in her way to try to make him become a little more comfortable with it. </p><p>He studied the guide, he was handsome. With brown hair curling at the ends and eyes that shone when he spoke about \u2013 what Phil assumed was - his biggest hobby. He was about to slap himself in the face for even thinking it. But the guy in front of him reminded him of his ex. This was definitely not the right time to bring back those thoughts. He was supposed to forget them for fuck sake and yet he couldn\u2019t quite stop staring.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan was busy trying to catch everybody\u2019s attention. He\u2019d just explained how to fasten the harness and how to put it on. He\u2019d have to check everyone\u2019s when they were about to ride the zip-line anyway to make sure they\u2019d done it right. Especially the kids but there didn\u2019t seem to be any here so that made his job a little bit easier, even if children were about the cutest fucking thing ever.</p><p>While Dan passed out the colourful helmets \u2013 some orange, other purple and grey \u2013 he watched the group one, after one put them on. They looked like a couple of colourful eggs it was quite hilarious to be honest. Dan already had his own helmet on and they were walking towards the forest. The ladder up to the zip-line was located a small walking distance from where they were now, at the entrance.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t originally been this happy. He really felt like everything was right in his life. At first his parents had been disappointed in Dan when he threw away his education in law and chose this small branch in the wide education selection that he had had. It had been hard for them to accept it. Dan himself had felt betrayed like they truly didn\u2019t want him to be happy. It was a tough feeling to harbour. Sometimes it felt like he\u2019d swallowed a stone and it weighed him down. The sinking feeling in his stomach hadn\u2019t returned since he decided to ditch them and solely work with what really made him happy. </p><p>Along that long road he\u2019d made friends with Louise which had definitely enriched his life. When Louise and her husband got a baby, Dan often visited. It was a bit lonely without her at work too, so he said to himself that he had to see her. Dan had always wanted kids of his own too, something that he\u2019d proclaimed many times while he\u2019d sat at Louise\u2019s home helping Darcy putting beads on the fuse bead pegboard. Louise had smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d be a great father\u201d.</p><p>The problem with that though was that Dan liked guys, don\u2019t misunderstand him, he likes girls too. Dan just tends to fall for guys much easier it seems. He\u2019s had one girlfriend before, Luna, at age 11. It hadn\u2019t been that serious probably due to their age. But Dan had liked to take her out to the movies and kiss her cheek. He didn\u2019t do that very often now, kiss somebody, anybody. Maybe Dan realised something was missing from his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil\u2019s sister dragged him after the guide. He\u2019d never really managed to catch the guides name and he didn\u2019t dare to ask for it. \u00a0When they were at the massive wooden ladder he gulped. But his sister seemed to radiate excitement, she pats his shoulder repeatedly and pointed up through the thick branches so that he \u2013 when he followed her arm with his gaze \u2013 saw the zip-line. </p><p>He tried to calm himself down, but to no avail. When suddenly the guide asked who wanted to go first his sister\u2019s hand flew up in the air. That wasn\u2019t the worst, his hand was linked with hers. Phil\u2019s eyes were wide, he looked terrified. </p><p>The guide nods his head and waves at them to follow him as he starts to climb up. Phil can\u2019t help but admire the way his muscles work. The view is even better when he starts climbing. His sister is climbing below him. She whispers to him to \u2018hurry-the-fuck-up\u2019 and he continues upwards, albeit a little faster than before.</p><p>Once they\u2019re up Phil stands huddled close to his sister as the guide grabs the hook. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d Phil doesn\u2019t even have time to bat an eyelid before his sister takes a step forward. The guide gives her a dimpled smile and attaches the hook to the harness. He checks so that its fastened securely around her.</p><p>Phil can\u2019t help but feel a tad bit of jealousy and he doesn\u2019t really know why. The guy is handsome, and he sure seems a lot nicer than Phil\u2019s ex. Phil swallows around the lump in his throat when he sees his own sister gain momentum. Fear tickles his stomach when its only him and the handsome guide left. He turns to Phil with a wicked smile and shining eyes \u201care you ready?\u201d. Phil nods meekly. He\u2019s sure he looks even paler than he did before.</p><p>\u201cOkay let me just check your harness.\u201d His fingers dance over the straps and Phil almost swears he can feel a fire igniting his skin even though it was just the graze of a fingertip. It takes longer for him to check Phil\u2019s harness than his sisters but when he\u2019s done he rises up again and laughs \u201cAll done!\u201d In the short time the guides hands where on him he\u2019d managed to forget what death-trap his sister had set him up to.</p><p>They guy takes the hook while chit-chatting to him \u201cI\u2019m sure your girlfriend will be happy to see you fly through the treetops like Tarzan, she seemed very eager. But don\u2019t worry our other guide is waiting there on the other side if you want to ask them anything.\u201d Phil chokes on his own spit. The guys eyes widen as he pats him on the back to help Phil regain his composure. Phil manages to get out \u201cshe\u2019s not my girlfriend. That\u2019s my sister.\u201d The guide takes a step back, a visible pink tint coating his cheeks. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for assuming\u201d he says holding up his hands in defence. \u201cNo worries\u201d Phil dismisses gently.</p><p>As Phil grips the rod and just lets himself \u201cenjoy\u201d the ride he finds himself watching the sky and the branches of the trees that seems so close. But suddenly something seems to fall onto the line before him he doesn\u2019t even have time to stop the scream erupting from him, before he comes to stop. Rocking back and forth from the hook attached to his harness. In the panic he let go of the rod but now he reaches to grab it once more. He can feel the panic rise. \u00a0How will he get out of this situation?</p><p>-</p><p>Dan can see the pretty guy get smaller and smaller as he moves across the gap. He fucks up all his chances it seems. Why did he just assume that the guy had a girlfriend, it made Dan happy to know that it wasn\u2019t so, but it was still as embarrassing. Maybe the guy wasn\u2019t even interested in guys. You\u2019re not the centre of the worlds attention Dan, he reminded himself. </p><p>A sudden scream makes Dans eyes seek after its owner. He then sees it; the handsome guy is stuck in the middle of the zip line. Dan immediately freezes with fear. He knows how to handle this, he\u2019s been trained for this yet suddenly he felt weak to his knees. He\u2019d seen it happen before but had never done it before, himself.</p><p>Dan hooked the carabiner to the line. The gloves he has on his hands will prevent him from burning his hands. Dan took a deep breath and grasped the line then he started to monkey bar climbing his way towards the man. It felt like his arms were wobbly and he drew blood from his bottom lip that was securely wedged between his teeth. At the same time strangely enough, his heart fluttered. Maybe it was because of the thought that he would be able to talk to the man again. He felt a little bit like a hero in one of his childhood stories. Except that the heroes never seemed to be afraid and Dan was utterly terrified.</p><p>When Dan came closer he saw the mans face. His eyes wide and terrified he seemed to breathe loudly. \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m by your side any moment now\u201d he reassured as he slowly inched himself closer. His face was scrunched up in a grimace. \u201cTell me your name, what\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked to try to calm down the anxious man. \u201cPhil\u201d the other man gasped out clearly wanting to get out of this situation immediately. \u201cOkay Phil I want you to remain calm and collected and when I reach to you let me handle the situation, don\u2019t try to cling to me, okay?\u201d.</p><p>As scared as he, himself was he didn\u2019t show it. He had to stay calm on the outside for Phil\u2019s sake, but for himself as well because if he let himself panic he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle this much longer.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil could feel him coming closer, the line juddered slightly. When he finally was by Phil\u2019s side he hooked onto Phil and started dragging them both backward. Steadily they moved back. The thing that had stuck to the line fell down. It seemed to be a branch.</p><p>When they were back to safety at the platform the guide stepped up on it and gripped Phil\u2019s hand. \u00a0Now the two of them stood on solid ground. The guide unhooked them both and they stepped away from the abyss. He exhaled with relief happy that he was safe. Then his eyes set on the guy in front of him. When he saw that the guide was smiling, he realised that he, himself was grinning dumbly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of my saviour?\u201d Phil asked curiously. They stood close and Phil\u2019s heart did a little flippy thing.</p><p>The guy only grinned back showing the whites of his teeth. \u201cDan\u201d \u201cHi Dan, thank you for saving me, is there anyway I can make it up to you?\u201d Phil asked a small smile on his soft pink lips. </p><p>Dan\u2019s gaze slowly drifted down to Phil\u2019s lips and he bit his lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know you tell me, how would you make it up to me?\u201d Dan asked and now he was looking into Phil\u2019s eyes again. \u201cHow about a coffee date\u2026?\u201d Phil said nervously. \u201cWhat about a kiss first?\u201d Dan said smugly. Reaching up and placing a soft hand on Phil\u2019s cheek, his thumb drifting along Phil\u2019s jawline. Phil gulped and whispered \u201cplease\u201d. So, Dan reached out his other hand and very gently cupped Phil\u2019s cheeks. His fingers smooth and tender, igniting Phil\u2019s whole body. He slowly leaned in. When his lips met Phil\u2019s, they were soft and gentle. </p><p>Phil could stay like this forever, this could be the beginning of something new, something great. And Dan was suddenly sure that this was exactly what he had been missing.</p></p>",

Although it should be fine, they were checked once a week.</p><p>Dan secured himself and checked his harness then he gripped tightly around the holding-rod. He took a few steps back. The anticipation and fear were tugging at his stomach; Even if he had done this a hundred times. Then he closed his eyes and let go. What he felt first was the bubbly feeling in his stomach growing hotter and his heart beating even faster. He felt alive like the whole world belonged to him. When he cracked his eyes open the bright morning light almost shocked him once again. The view was as stunning as always. </p><p>Far down, underneath him he could see a small river, the fir forest reaching up to touch the sky all around him. The vegetation far down there, on the ground that humans set their feet on looked so luscious, thriving. He was distracted from all the fear now, to amazed once again, he always seems to forget how amazing it is. It reminds him of why he chose to work out here. Although funnily enough he&rsquo;s both scared of trees and moths. He blames it all on the blare witch project for keeping him away, cowering at his home for a whole week, refusing to work because he was too scared. Louise had come to his rescue and dragged him back to the beautiful forest.</p><p>He&rsquo;d just about landed when the alarm on his phone rang telling him he had about twenty minutes to get back to the entrance and gather the group. Normally it was some school class enjoying a class-only-day that they had gathered money for. But sometimes and only sometimes, there were office people who showed up. Some of them even had suits. Dan had to right out tell them to go change and that they had spare plain shirts with the parks logo on they could borrow. Never had he thought that boring old men and women would want to ride zip-lines with their colleagues. But apparently there was maybe - and emphasis on maybe - some part of them that still had a tad of childishness. Even if it felt highly unlikely.</p><p>There were of course regular groups with a blend of different people &ndash; young to old. Dan thinks that they&rsquo;re probably his favourite. He likes to teach the small children how to grip the rod and fasten their helmet and then look into their eyes and promise &ndash; on his whole career &ndash; that it absolutely will go fine and that they will enjoy the ride. And they trusted him, all of them. Maybe it was because the parents smiled so fondly when the child sought their parents eye contact for confirmation. Or it was the dimpled smile and quick light nod from Dan. Either way they all - for most of the time - enjoyed the ride even if they were a little bit scared.</p><p>When his phone rang again he checked what in the world it could be. It was of course Louise trying to FaceTime him. He answered with a slight smirk when he saw Louise&rsquo;s irritated look. &ldquo;Daniel Howell, where are you? You&rsquo;re supposed to be here in about fifteen minutes and you haven&rsquo;t even collected all the harnesses. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve already sorted out some of the supplies for you, you lazy oaf&rdquo;. </p><p>His smirk quickly turned into a frown &ldquo;look I&rsquo;m sorry Louise, I was checking the zip-lines, I was up so early that I kind of forgot the time. Thank you for doing that for me.&rdquo; Louise seemed to soften &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Dan up early? I thought you said that 3 am Wikipedia browsing were your middle name?&rdquo; Without waiting for an answer she continued. &rdquo;Now hurry your ass over here&rdquo; she barked out the last sentence but he didn&rsquo;t miss the large smile littering her face. Dan smiled to himself as he slipped his phone into the small pocket close to his chest.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil was in a deep debate about whether sandwiches were better with salad or without. Phil&rsquo;s sister only glared over at him from the driver&rsquo;s seat. She could only glower at him occasionally because she had to keep her eyes on the road. &ldquo;Salad only belongs in salads it has the same name even! Its not supposed to be crammed between two bread lumps and be called sandwich.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Little sis, clearly you don&rsquo;t know anything about the true art of sandwiches. I, the master sandwich maker has actually prepared one for each. And skilful as I am I noted that you despise salad and therefore I made one without and one with.&rdquo; Phil grinned at her and couldn&rsquo;t contain a laughter when she gave him a shocked stare then it changed to a sly look.</p><p>&ldquo;I see brother, what a gift you have. Then me putting a slice of cheese on both of our sandwiches for our starved tastebuds wouldn&rsquo;t bother you.&rdquo; Phil drew a gasp.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sis don&rsquo;t you dare&rdquo; he deadpanned. She only laughed &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m not actually that cruel. Though I think you should test something new time to time.&rdquo; </p><p>Phil looked down at the map and grumbled &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lactose intolerant&rdquo; She stuck her tongue out, her eyes not leaving the road this time &ldquo;Yes, but you wont die from testing it, your allergy isn&rsquo;t that bad, you just get bad in the stomach.&rdquo; He knew she was right but there was no way he was confirming that, so he stayed silent for the rest of the ride. They weren&rsquo;t actually arguing, the banter that was going on was playful. Phil couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he&rsquo;d had the opportunity to hang out with someone let alone his own sister. </p><p>A loud happy shout cut him off in his thoughts and he looked up from the map. &ldquo;Where here little brother! Finally, I can show you what I&rsquo;ve learned to love for the last couple of months.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;High five&rdquo; Louise excitedly screamed when she saw him enter the small souvenir shop. He had just finished everything and had about five minutes before all the participants would show up. Louise had come up to him from behind the counter with a raised hand. &ldquo;Louise, thank you, I couldn&rsquo;t have done this without you, honestly I just finished what was left. Can I make it up for you?&rdquo; Louise&rsquo;s smile only grew. </p><p>She high-fived Dan and then said, &ldquo;What about you take me and Darcy to the cinema premiere of the new Disney movie?&rdquo; Dan smiled so that his nose wrinkled &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to. Sunday?&rdquo;. She nodded and then grabbed his shoulders spinning him around so that he now faced the exit &ldquo;hurry on out now, your group is waiting on you&rdquo;.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil stood nervously with the group as the young guy explained the rules to them. He huddled close to his sister. It wasn&rsquo;t the fact that Phil hated strangers. No, he was just very uncomfortable when they stood so close. He grabbed his sisters hand and interlinked their hands. In an instant he felt so much safer. She looked over at him and gave him a reassuring smile. She knew just how hard this was for him. She even went out in her way to try to make him become a little more comfortable with it. </p><p>He studied the guide, he was handsome. With brown hair curling at the ends and eyes that shone when he spoke about &ndash; what Phil assumed was - his biggest hobby. He was about to slap himself in the face for even thinking it. But the guy in front of him reminded him of his ex. This was definitely not the right time to bring back those thoughts. He was supposed to forget them for fuck sake and yet he couldn&rsquo;t quite stop staring.</p><p>-</p><p>Dan was busy trying to catch everybody&rsquo;s attention. He&rsquo;d just explained how to fasten the harness and how to put it on. He&rsquo;d have to check everyone&rsquo;s when they were about to ride the zip-line anyway to make sure they&rsquo;d done it right. Especially the kids but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any here so that made his job a little bit easier, even if children were about the cutest fucking thing ever.</p><p>While Dan passed out the colourful helmets &ndash; some orange, other purple and grey &ndash; he watched the group one, after one put them on. They looked like a couple of colourful eggs it was quite hilarious to be honest. Dan already had his own helmet on and they were walking towards the forest. The ladder up to the zip-line was located a small walking distance from where they were now, at the entrance.</p><p>Dan hadn&rsquo;t originally been this happy. He really felt like everything was right in his life. At first his parents had been disappointed in Dan when he threw away his education in law and chose this small branch in the wide education selection that he had had. It had been hard for them to accept it. Dan himself had felt betrayed like they truly didn&rsquo;t want him to be happy. It was a tough feeling to harbour. Sometimes it felt like he&rsquo;d swallowed a stone and it weighed him down. The sinking feeling in his stomach hadn&rsquo;t returned since he decided to ditch them and solely work with what really made him happy. </p><p>Along that long road he&rsquo;d made friends with Louise which had definitely enriched his life. When Louise and her husband got a baby, Dan often visited. It was a bit lonely without her at work too, so he said to himself that he had to see her. Dan had always wanted kids of his own too, something that he&rsquo;d proclaimed many times while he&rsquo;d sat at Louise&rsquo;s home helping Darcy putting beads on the fuse bead pegboard. Louise had smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be a great father&rdquo;.</p><p>The problem with that though was that Dan liked guys, don&rsquo;t misunderstand him, he likes girls too. Dan just tends to fall for guys much easier it seems. He&rsquo;s had one girlfriend before, Luna, at age 11. It hadn&rsquo;t been that serious probably due to their age. But Dan had liked to take her out to the movies and kiss her cheek. He didn&rsquo;t do that very often now, kiss somebody, anybody. Maybe Dan realised something was missing from his life.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s sister dragged him after the guide. He&rsquo;d never really managed to catch the guides name and he didn&rsquo;t dare to ask for it. &nbsp;When they were at the massive wooden ladder he gulped. But his sister seemed to radiate excitement, she pats his shoulder repeatedly and pointed up through the thick branches so that he &ndash; when he followed her arm with his gaze &ndash; saw the zip-line. </p><p>He tried to calm himself down, but to no avail. When suddenly the guide asked who wanted to go first his sister&rsquo;s hand flew up in the air. That wasn&rsquo;t the worst, his hand was linked with hers. Phil&rsquo;s eyes were wide, he looked terrified. </p><p>The guide nods his head and waves at them to follow him as he starts to climb up. Phil can&rsquo;t help but admire the way his muscles work. The view is even better when he starts climbing. His sister is climbing below him. She whispers to him to &lsquo;hurry-the-fuck-up&rsquo; and he continues upwards, albeit a little faster than before.</p><p>Once they&rsquo;re up Phil stands huddled close to his sister as the guide grabs the hook. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s first?&rdquo; Phil doesn&rsquo;t even have time to bat an eyelid before his sister takes a step forward. The guide gives her a dimpled smile and attaches the hook to the harness. He checks so that its fastened securely around her.</p><p>Phil can&rsquo;t help but feel a tad bit of jealousy and he doesn&rsquo;t really know why. The guy is handsome, and he sure seems a lot nicer than Phil&rsquo;s ex. Phil swallows around the lump in his throat when he sees his own sister gain momentum. Fear tickles his stomach when its only him and the handsome guide left. He turns to Phil with a wicked smile and shining eyes &ldquo;are you ready?&rdquo;. Phil nods meekly. He&rsquo;s sure he looks even paler than he did before.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay let me just check your harness.&rdquo; His fingers dance over the straps and Phil almost swears he can feel a fire igniting his skin even though it was just the graze of a fingertip. It takes longer for him to check Phil&rsquo;s harness than his sisters but when he&rsquo;s done he rises up again and laughs &ldquo;All done!&rdquo; In the short time the guides hands where on him he&rsquo;d managed to forget what death-trap his sister had set him up to.</p><p>They guy takes the hook while chit-chatting to him &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your girlfriend will be happy to see you fly through the treetops like Tarzan, she seemed very eager. But don&rsquo;t worry our other guide is waiting there on the other side if you want to ask them anything.&rdquo; Phil chokes on his own spit. The guys eyes widen as he pats him on the back to help Phil regain his composure. Phil manages to get out &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not my girlfriend. That&rsquo;s my sister.&rdquo; The guide takes a step back, a visible pink tint coating his cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry for assuming&rdquo; he says holding up his hands in defence. &ldquo;No worries&rdquo; Phil dismisses gently.</p><p>As Phil grips the rod and just lets himself &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; the ride he finds himself watching the sky and the branches of the trees that seems so close. But suddenly something seems to fall onto the line before him he doesn&rsquo;t even have time to stop the scream erupting from him, before he comes to stop. Rocking back and forth from the hook attached to his harness. In the panic he let go of the rod but now he reaches to grab it once more. He can feel the panic rise. &nbsp;How will he get out of this situation?</p><p>-</p><p>Dan can see the pretty guy get smaller and smaller as he moves across the gap. He fucks up all his chances it seems. Why did he just assume that the guy had a girlfriend, it made Dan happy to know that it wasn&rsquo;t so, but it was still as embarrassing. Maybe the guy wasn&rsquo;t even interested in guys. You&rsquo;re not the centre of the worlds attention Dan, he reminded himself. </p><p>A sudden scream makes Dans eyes seek after its owner. He then sees it; the handsome guy is stuck in the middle of the zip line. Dan immediately freezes with fear. He knows how to handle this, he&rsquo;s been trained for this yet suddenly he felt weak to his knees. He&rsquo;d seen it happen before but had never done it before, himself.</p><p>Dan hooked the carabiner to the line. The gloves he has on his hands will prevent him from burning his hands. Dan took a deep breath and grasped the line then he started to monkey bar climbing his way towards the man. It felt like his arms were wobbly and he drew blood from his bottom lip that was securely wedged between his teeth. At the same time strangely enough, his heart fluttered. Maybe it was because of the thought that he would be able to talk to the man again. He felt a little bit like a hero in one of his childhood stories. Except that the heroes never seemed to be afraid and Dan was utterly terrified.</p><p>When Dan came closer he saw the mans face. His eyes wide and terrified he seemed to breathe loudly. &ldquo;Calm down, I&rsquo;m by your side any moment now&rdquo; he reassured as he slowly inched himself closer. His face was scrunched up in a grimace. &ldquo;Tell me your name, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked to try to calm down the anxious man. &ldquo;Phil&rdquo; the other man gasped out clearly wanting to get out of this situation immediately. &ldquo;Okay Phil I want you to remain calm and collected and when I reach to you let me handle the situation, don&rsquo;t try to cling to me, okay?&rdquo;.</p><p>As scared as he, himself was he didn&rsquo;t show it. He had to stay calm on the outside for Phil&rsquo;s sake, but for himself as well because if he let himself panic he wasn&rsquo;t sure he could handle this much longer.</p><p>-</p><p>Phil could feel him coming closer, the line juddered slightly. When he finally was by Phil&rsquo;s side he hooked onto Phil and started dragging them both backward. Steadily they moved back. The thing that had stuck to the line fell down. It seemed to be a branch.</p><p>When they were back to safety at the platform the guide stepped up on it and gripped Phil&rsquo;s hand. &nbsp;Now the two of them stood on solid ground. The guide unhooked them both and they stepped away from the abyss. He exhaled with relief happy that he was safe. Then his eyes set on the guy in front of him. When he saw that the guide was smiling, he realised that he, himself was grinning dumbly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of my saviour?&rdquo; Phil asked curiously. They stood close and Phil&rsquo;s heart did a little flippy thing.</p><p>The guy only grinned back showing the whites of his teeth. &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi Dan, thank you for saving me, is there anyway I can make it up to you?&rdquo; Phil asked a small smile on his soft pink lips. </p><p>Dan&rsquo;s gaze slowly drifted down to Phil&rsquo;s lips and he bit his lip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you tell me, how would you make it up to me?&rdquo; Dan asked and now he was looking into Phil&rsquo;s eyes again. &ldquo;How about a coffee date&hellip;?&rdquo; Phil said nervously. &ldquo;What about a kiss first?&rdquo; Dan said smugly. Reaching up and placing a soft hand on Phil&rsquo;s cheek, his thumb drifting along Phil&rsquo;s jawline. Phil gulped and whispered &ldquo;please&rdquo;. So, Dan reached out his other hand and very gently cupped Phil&rsquo;s cheeks. His fingers smooth and tender, igniting Phil&rsquo;s whole body. He slowly leaned in. When his lips met Phil&rsquo;s, they were soft and gentle. </p><p>Phil could stay like this forever, this could be the beginning of something new, something great. And Dan was suddenly sure that this was exactly what he had been missing.</p></p>",
