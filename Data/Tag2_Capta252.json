            "description": "I am Mitch of Singapore, also an Ace. I enjoy reading superhero comics (especially Marvel); comic books aren't just for boys, girls read it too. However, I have no interest in any Marvel movie due to my jaded attitude, so I prefer Marvel cartoons like 90s X-Men TAS and Avengers EMH. \nThose Marvel comics I love reading are New Warriors, X-Men, Young Avengers, X-Factor, Avengers (not that Bendis era), Generation X, Avengers Academy and X-Force. \nBig fan of New Warriors and X-Men. \nMy Favourite Marvel characters are...GAMBIT (Remy LeBeau), JUBILEE (Jubilation Lee), SPEEDBALL (Robbie Baldwin), WICCAN (Billy Kaplan), JUSTICE (Vance Astrovik), ROGUE (Anna Marie), SPEED (Tommy Shepherd), NIGHTCRAWLER (Kurt Wagner), FIRESTAR (Angelica Jones), QUICKSILVER (Pietro Maximoff), SHE-HULK (Jennifer Walters), QUASAR (Wendell Vaughn) and COSMO the space dog.",

At a WHIZ Radio spelling bee hosted by Billy, Freddy and Billy met Billy&rsquo;s long-lost sister Mary, whom Freddy immediately fell for.\n</p><p>Later, Freddy and his grandfather Jacob went on a fishing trip in the Fawcett Bay, while <b>Captain Marvel</b> was engaged in a battle with Captain Nazi.\n<b> Marvel</b> knocked Nazi into the lake, and the Freemans are attacked when \nthey attempt to save the villain. <b>Captain Marvel</b> intervenes and rushes \nboth injured bystanders to a hospital.

Junior was a member of the Outsiders for a while, although he was apprehensive about the team&rsquo;s dark tone. He and Marvel Family nemesis Sabbac, The Seven Deadly Sins, and Dr. Sivana all played major roles.\n</p><p>Junior, <b>Captain Marvel</b>, and Mary Marvel made brief appearances during the <i>Infinite Crisis</i>. One year later, Captain Marvel, Jr. is no longer a member of the Outsiders. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"1367\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0b91aba1a97ac1a55f26e83d8fd3445/tumblr_inline_pgswp29kCT1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"1367\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>The Trials of Shazam!\n</b></i></h2><p>When the wizard Shazam was killed, his and Mary&rsquo;s mystical powers were revoked. Now that Batson is the controller of the Rock of Eternity,\n it is only through overcoming a series of trials and judgments that \nFreeman would regain his mystical powers and succeed Batson as <b>Captain \nMarvel</b>.\n</p><p>Stripped of his former superhuman powers, Freeman was trying to \nprove himself worthy to possess all of Batson&rsquo;s former power levels. \nEach of the six beings who grant their abilities to <b>Captain Marvel</b>\u2014Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury\u2014would present Freddy with a &ldquo;trial&rdquo;,\n which Freddy would have to complete successfully in order to be granted\n with that man&rsquo;s particular power. If he completes all six tasks, he \nwill take on the name Shazam. Zarab Babak, a demoted necromancer, serves as Freddy&rsquo;s guide during his trials.\n</p><p>The current gods that give Freddy his powers are in no way related to the Olympian counterparts. They are known as the Lords of Magic, and simply share their names with them.\n</p><p>The first of these was the trial of wisdom set by Solomon. He had\n to withstand the pain of getting a magical tattoo placed upon his soul.\n The woman Rachel Zallman was Solomon himself in his mortal disguise. He\n survived the process and gained a better understanding of himself, in \ndoing so he was granted the wisdom of Solomon.<br/></p><p>At the same time, however, a dark organization known as the \nCouncil of Merlin are backing their own candidate, a Creole sorceress \nnamed Sabina. If Sabina wins the trials, then the power of Shazam will be lost to the Marvel Family and she will control it.\n</p><p>The second trial, the trial of courage, was set by Achilles. He \nhad to combat against a &ldquo;Hate Empath&rdquo; which fed on the hatred of the \npeople in the middle east. With the help of Achilles in the mortal \ndisguise of a soldier he defeated the Empathic demon, though not before \nSabina shot Achilles in his heel, killing him. Though Achilles didn&rsquo;t \ntruly die but moved on to the next great warrior. For his effort he was \ngranted his <b>Captain Marvel </b>red and yellow outfit and the courage of \nAchilles.\n</p><p>The third trial, the trial of strength, is set by Hercules. He \nhas to find a way of breaking Hercules out of jail, who in his mortal \ndisguise faced off against Medusa and her minions in the form of a gang \nof yakuza. He inadvertently killed passing innocents thus breaking the \nmagical covenant for a being of his rank. Fate punished him by making \nHercules mortal and thus he was subject to their rules, which meant jail\n time as well. Putting Freddy in a hard position before he could make \nhis decision Sabina in disguise as a lawyer brought the head of Medusa \nout to paralyze Hercules then forced him to bestow her with his power. \nHercules did so but apparently doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to thieves so Sabine \nis only given half the power. \u00a0Hercules then bestows \u00a0the other HALF of \nthe Strength of Hercules to Freddy. Sabina and Freddy fight but are \nevenly matched. After she teleports away before Freddy can take his \nwinning shot, Hercules says he passes the trail but he can only truly be\n capable of all the power after he defeats Sabina. \u00a0\n</p><p>The fourth trial, a trial of stamina to be set by Atlas never \ntakes place. Sabina teleported deep underground to where Atlas held up \nthe world and killed him with the Dagger of Three Faults to steal his \npower. Upon finding him Zareb has Freddy take Atlas&rsquo;s place which Freddy\n reluctantly does. \u00a0However and taking on the role is to much to bare, \nfor the 3 minutes he wears the helm of Atlas seems like months to him, \nluckily <b>Marvel</b> comes and relieves him but not before warning him that he\n can only be away from the Rock of Eternity for 24 hours. Freddy and \nZareb then go to a local hospital to speak to the mortal disguise of Apollo,\n so that he may take Atlas&rsquo; place as the next in line. Apollo refuses \nbut then decides on giving Freddy his trial, a simple fight if he loses \nhis life is forfeit and if Freddy wins he gets Apollos&rsquo; power. They \nfight while elsewhere Sabina takes control of the Council of Merlin. \nWhen lives of innocent are put into danger Apollo saves them and relents\n to become the new holder of the world. In becoming a god again he \nrelinquished his mortal life as if it never happened, with the \nrealization Apollo upset over his loss of mortal life, thus Freddy has \nbeen bestowed with only HALF of the Healing of Apollo. Only truly \ncapable of all the power after he gets a replacement for him as Atlas&rsquo;s \nreplacement.\n</p><p>The fifth trail of speed set by Mercury also never takes place. \nSabina killed hundreds of elves to learn a piece of information to find \nMercury, she then tore through a couple more people to get the rest of \nthe information. All this led to Tawky Tawny\n who fights Sabina and has the upper hand until his inclination to talk \ngave her a the necessary information she needed to take him down. Before\n she could do so Mercury revealed himself just as Freddy arrived forcing\n him and Sabina to go after him. At this point Freddy lost on options \nfor the trials he was failing calls along with Marvel and Zareb on the Shadowpact and Zatanna\n for aid in searching for Mercury in the hopes that he finds him so the \nSabina doesn&rsquo;t. Meanwhile Sabina and the Council of Merlin find \nMercury&rsquo;s mortal children and threaten their lives forcing Mercury out \nof hiding. He succeeds in using his speed to save his daughter but his \nson is chained to Sabina and she uses the Dagger of Three Faults to take\n his power. Without the power they are on equal footing, thus Freddy \nplays the last card he has and calls on on the Justice League of America for help.\n</p><p>The sixth trail of power set by Zeus. <b>Marvel</b> and Freddy knowing \nfull well that if Sabina gets the power of Zeus she can take the rest \nfrom Freddy. Though at the same time they know Zeus will never give her \nthe power willingly so she has to magically compel him to do it. The \nonly way for her to do so is by using old magic, namely a Blood Spell, \nshe has to sacrifice one million people. Meanwhile Sabina and the \nCouncil of Merlin asks for the backing of Merlin himself in return \nSabina as the Acolyte of the powers of Shazam promises to be Merlins&rsquo; \nChampion and corporeal anchor to the earth realm. In the battle a portal\n opens in Las Vegas and demons pour through killing all in their path \nand transforming them in to demons as well. The spell is two fold if one\n million souls are killed and taken then Merlin gains a foothold in this\n reality and is then empowered to compel Zeus to award the powers of \nShazam to Sabina. The Justice League fights the demons and Freddy fights\n one on one with Sabina, and tells her of his plan is to allow her to \nbeat him up so he can get her closer to the immersion portal she opened.\n If he throws them both through the one way portal they will be \ndestroyed and all the suffering she has caused that day will be undone. \nThis will also cause the powers of Shazam to be lost to all. \u00a0Freddy \nsees this as more fitting then allowing her and evil to wield them and \ndestroy the Earth. In making this decision of self-sacrifice and bravery\n Freddy has appeased the Fates and Zareb revealed himself as Zeus. \nHaving witnessed all of Freddy&rsquo;s trials Zeus, as Lord of the Gods of \nMagic and Gatekeeper of the Power of Shazam, gives Freddy his power and \nbestows upon Freddy the remaining powers from he other gods stolen by Sabina.\n In saying &ldquo;Shazam&rdquo; Freddy is bestowed the full power of Shazam and \nSabina is sent flying into the Emergsion portal destroying her army of \ndemons and her.\n</p><p>Afterwards, Freddy talks to Zeus/Zareb, who explains that he \nneeded an anchor to the Realm of Earth. In Freddy proving himself, Zeus \ncould reclaim his Terran province, So that he may return to his full \npower. Freddy apologizes for giving him a hard time during the trials to\n which Zeus says it wouldn&rsquo;t have been as much fun. Zeus tells him that \nhis days of chasing criminals are secondary, he is now needed to protect\n the world, to keep the darkness at bay. To keep magic in balance.\n</p><p>At some point after the Trials of Shazam, Freddy helps the Justice Society of America track down Black Adam with Mr. Terrific&rsquo;s T-Spheres testing Freddy&rsquo;s magic lightning signature. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/373681283afb3868309dfbe620887536/tumblr_inline_pgswt0YSc71qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Cry for Justice\n</b></i></h2><p><b>Captain Marvel</b> joined the splinter faction of Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen&rsquo;s Justice League in search of the villain Prometheus.

He then contemplates about asking Black Adam for help \nand transforming into Shazam permanently. Later he gets an invite for \nArticle X by Alan Scott which is actually a Superhero Draft. He joins most of Earth&rsquo;s heroes in the JLA&rsquo;s Hall of Justice.\n</p><p>After the activation of the Anti-Life Equation, Freddy fights his way to Khandaq to reach Black Adam to have him rejoin The Marvel Family, only for Black Adam to tell him he was unsure as the New Gods have overthrown the Lords of Magic and that as their champions they are at their weakest. Ultimately, Black Adam agreed to help, and joined Freddy and Tawny during the assault on Bludhaven. Almost immediately, Adam begins trying to kill Mary, who was part of Darkseid&rsquo;s forces. Adam said he looked into her eyes and didn&rsquo;t see Mary, but a leering old man. Throwing Adam aside, Mary attacked Freddy, saying that she had a new magic word.\n As the battle continued, Mary focused her attentions on Supergirl, but \nFreddy was able to grab Mary and shout &ldquo;Shazam&rdquo;, changing them both and \nsuppressing Desaad. Now in control again, Mary was horrified at her \nactions, saying she could never change back again, as Freddy told her it\n wasn&rsquo;t her fault.\n</p><p>When Black Adam strips Batson of his powers as Guardian of the \nRock of Eternity, Freeman was able to continue accessing his magical \npowers. \u00a0When the wizard Shazam was revived,\n he stripped all of the Marvels of their powers, and petrified Black \nAdam and Isis. Freddy was not affected by this as his powers come \ndirectly from the lords of magic. Shazam has stated he will deal with \nFreeman but whether the Wizard Shazam will challenge the gods to \nremove/reduce or change Freeman&rsquo;s powers has not been dealt with. <br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/80e7118281724ebbe90034d4da6df079/tumblr_inline_pgswukDGNS1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Post-Brightest Day\n</b></i></h2><p>Freddy later confronted Osiris in the process of killing a group of \ngunmen and two battled, with Osiris telling Freddy that he has to \ncontinue killing people in order to free his sister Isis from her stone \nimprisonment. Freddy eventually convinced Osiris that his sister would \nnot approve of the bloodshed that he has caused and offered to help him \nfind another way to save her, but Osiris instead betrayed Freddy, using \nhis abilities to summon a mystical bolt of lightning that reverted him \nback to his human form. Freddy immediately attempted to transform back \ninto <b>Captain Marvel</b>, but was horrified to discover that he no longer \npossesses his abilities and that they were robbed from him completely. \nOsiris then departed, leaving a distraught Freddy to be frustrated over \nthe loss of his powers.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1231\" data-orig-height=\"1285\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecced032f5b0cfec7c5688ec7a6f8c3d/tumblr_inline_pgswttDaBg1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1231\" data-orig-height=\"1285\"/></figure><h2><i><b>Fun Facts</b></i></h2><ul><li> Unlike Batson, Freeman does NOT receive his powers from the \nWizard Shazam but directly from the six gods as their direct champion. \nThis has allowed Freeman to continue using these magical powers after \nthe Wizard revoked Batson&rsquo;s powers and abilities.

One of Freddy\u2019s friends was Billy Batson, <b>Captain Marvel\u2019s</b> alter ego, who worked as a boy reporter for WHIZ Radio. At a WHIZ Radio spelling bee hosted by Billy, Freddy and Billy met Billy\u2019s long-lost sister Mary, whom Freddy immediately fell for.\n</p><p>Later, Freddy and his grandfather Jacob went on a fishing trip in the Fawcett Bay, while <b>Captain Marvel</b> was engaged in a battle with Captain Nazi.\n<b> Marvel</b> knocked Nazi into the lake, and the Freemans are attacked when \nthey attempt to save the villain. <b>Captain Marvel</b> intervenes and rushes \nboth injured bystanders to a hospital.

Junior was a member of the Outsiders for a while, although he was apprehensive about the team\u2019s dark tone. He and Marvel Family nemesis Sabbac, The Seven Deadly Sins, and Dr. Sivana all played major roles.\n</p><p>Junior, <b>Captain Marvel</b>, and Mary Marvel made brief appearances during the <i>Infinite Crisis</i>. One year later, Captain Marvel, Jr. is no longer a member of the Outsiders. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"1367\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0b91aba1a97ac1a55f26e83d8fd3445/tumblr_inline_pgswp29kCT1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"900\" data-orig-height=\"1367\"></figure><h2>\n<i><b>The Trials of Shazam!\n</b></i></h2><p>When the wizard Shazam was killed, his and Mary\u2019s mystical powers were revoked. Now that Batson is the controller of the Rock of Eternity,\n it is only through overcoming a series of trials and judgments that \nFreeman would regain his mystical powers and succeed Batson as <b>Captain \nMarvel</b>.\n</p><p>Stripped of his former superhuman powers, Freeman was trying to \nprove himself worthy to possess all of Batson\u2019s former power levels. \nEach of the six beings who grant their abilities to <b>Captain Marvel</b>\u2014Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury\u2014would present Freddy with a \u201ctrial\u201d,\n which Freddy would have to complete successfully in order to be granted\n with that man\u2019s particular power. If he completes all six tasks, he \nwill take on the name Shazam. Zarab Babak, a demoted necromancer, serves as Freddy\u2019s guide during his trials.\n</p><p>The current gods that give Freddy his powers are in no way related to the Olympian counterparts. They are known as the Lords of Magic, and simply share their names with them.\n</p><p>The first of these was the trial of wisdom set by Solomon. He had\n to withstand the pain of getting a magical tattoo placed upon his soul.\n The woman Rachel Zallman was Solomon himself in his mortal disguise. He\n survived the process and gained a better understanding of himself, in \ndoing so he was granted the wisdom of Solomon.<br></p><p>At the same time, however, a dark organization known as the \nCouncil of Merlin are backing their own candidate, a Creole sorceress \nnamed Sabina. If Sabina wins the trials, then the power of Shazam will be lost to the Marvel Family and she will control it.\n</p><p>The second trial, the trial of courage, was set by Achilles. He \nhad to combat against a \u201cHate Empath\u201d which fed on the hatred of the \npeople in the middle east. With the help of Achilles in the mortal \ndisguise of a soldier he defeated the Empathic demon, though not before \nSabina shot Achilles in his heel, killing him. Though Achilles didn\u2019t \ntruly die but moved on to the next great warrior. For his effort he was \ngranted his <b>Captain Marvel </b>red and yellow outfit and the courage of \nAchilles.\n</p><p>The third trial, the trial of strength, is set by Hercules. He \nhas to find a way of breaking Hercules out of jail, who in his mortal \ndisguise faced off against Medusa and her minions in the form of a gang \nof yakuza. He inadvertently killed passing innocents thus breaking the \nmagical covenant for a being of his rank. Fate punished him by making \nHercules mortal and thus he was subject to their rules, which meant jail\n time as well. Putting Freddy in a hard position before he could make \nhis decision Sabina in disguise as a lawyer brought the head of Medusa \nout to paralyze Hercules then forced him to bestow her with his power. \nHercules did so but apparently doesn\u2019t take kindly to thieves so Sabine \nis only given half the power. \u00a0Hercules then bestows \u00a0the other HALF of \nthe Strength of Hercules to Freddy. Sabina and Freddy fight but are \nevenly matched. After she teleports away before Freddy can take his \nwinning shot, Hercules says he passes the trail but he can only truly be\n capable of all the power after he defeats Sabina. \u00a0\n</p><p>The fourth trial, a trial of stamina to be set by Atlas never \ntakes place. Sabina teleported deep underground to where Atlas held up \nthe world and killed him with the Dagger of Three Faults to steal his \npower. Upon finding him Zareb has Freddy take Atlas\u2019s place which Freddy\n reluctantly does. \u00a0However and taking on the role is to much to bare, \nfor the 3 minutes he wears the helm of Atlas seems like months to him, \nluckily <b>Marvel</b> comes and relieves him but not before warning him that he\n can only be away from the Rock of Eternity for 24 hours. Freddy and \nZareb then go to a local hospital to speak to the mortal disguise of Apollo,\n so that he may take Atlas\u2019 place as the next in line. Apollo refuses \nbut then decides on giving Freddy his trial, a simple fight if he loses \nhis life is forfeit and if Freddy wins he gets Apollos\u2019 power. They \nfight while elsewhere Sabina takes control of the Council of Merlin. \nWhen lives of innocent are put into danger Apollo saves them and relents\n to become the new holder of the world. In becoming a god again he \nrelinquished his mortal life as if it never happened, with the \nrealization Apollo upset over his loss of mortal life, thus Freddy has \nbeen bestowed with only HALF of the Healing of Apollo. Only truly \ncapable of all the power after he gets a replacement for him as Atlas\u2019s \nreplacement.\n</p><p>The fifth trail of speed set by Mercury also never takes place. \nSabina killed hundreds of elves to learn a piece of information to find \nMercury, she then tore through a couple more people to get the rest of \nthe information. All this led to Tawky Tawny\n who fights Sabina and has the upper hand until his inclination to talk \ngave her a the necessary information she needed to take him down. Before\n she could do so Mercury revealed himself just as Freddy arrived forcing\n him and Sabina to go after him. At this point Freddy lost on options \nfor the trials he was failing calls along with Marvel and Zareb on the Shadowpact and Zatanna\n for aid in searching for Mercury in the hopes that he finds him so the \nSabina doesn\u2019t. Meanwhile Sabina and the Council of Merlin find \nMercury\u2019s mortal children and threaten their lives forcing Mercury out \nof hiding. He succeeds in using his speed to save his daughter but his \nson is chained to Sabina and she uses the Dagger of Three Faults to take\n his power. Without the power they are on equal footing, thus Freddy \nplays the last card he has and calls on on the Justice League of America for help.\n</p><p>The sixth trail of power set by Zeus. <b>Marvel</b> and Freddy knowing \nfull well that if Sabina gets the power of Zeus she can take the rest \nfrom Freddy. Though at the same time they know Zeus will never give her \nthe power willingly so she has to magically compel him to do it. The \nonly way for her to do so is by using old magic, namely a Blood Spell, \nshe has to sacrifice one million people. Meanwhile Sabina and the \nCouncil of Merlin asks for the backing of Merlin himself in return \nSabina as the Acolyte of the powers of Shazam promises to be Merlins\u2019 \nChampion and corporeal anchor to the earth realm. In the battle a portal\n opens in Las Vegas and demons pour through killing all in their path \nand transforming them in to demons as well. The spell is two fold if one\n million souls are killed and taken then Merlin gains a foothold in this\n reality and is then empowered to compel Zeus to award the powers of \nShazam to Sabina. The Justice League fights the demons and Freddy fights\n one on one with Sabina, and tells her of his plan is to allow her to \nbeat him up so he can get her closer to the immersion portal she opened.\n If he throws them both through the one way portal they will be \ndestroyed and all the suffering she has caused that day will be undone. \nThis will also cause the powers of Shazam to be lost to all. \u00a0Freddy \nsees this as more fitting then allowing her and evil to wield them and \ndestroy the Earth. In making this decision of self-sacrifice and bravery\n Freddy has appeased the Fates and Zareb revealed himself as Zeus. \nHaving witnessed all of Freddy\u2019s trials Zeus, as Lord of the Gods of \nMagic and Gatekeeper of the Power of Shazam, gives Freddy his power and \nbestows upon Freddy the remaining powers from he other gods stolen by Sabina.\n In saying \u201cShazam\u201d Freddy is bestowed the full power of Shazam and \nSabina is sent flying into the Emergsion portal destroying her army of \ndemons and her.\n</p><p>Afterwards, Freddy talks to Zeus/Zareb, who explains that he \nneeded an anchor to the Realm of Earth. In Freddy proving himself, Zeus \ncould reclaim his Terran province, So that he may return to his full \npower. Freddy apologizes for giving him a hard time during the trials to\n which Zeus says it wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun. Zeus tells him that \nhis days of chasing criminals are secondary, he is now needed to protect\n the world, to keep the darkness at bay. To keep magic in balance.\n</p><p>At some point after the Trials of Shazam, Freddy helps the Justice Society of America track down Black Adam with Mr. Terrific\u2019s T-Spheres testing Freddy\u2019s magic lightning signature. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/373681283afb3868309dfbe620887536/tumblr_inline_pgswt0YSc71qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\"></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Cry for Justice\n</b></i></h2><p><b>Captain Marvel</b> joined the splinter faction of Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen\u2019s Justice League in search of the villain Prometheus.

He then contemplates about asking Black Adam for help \nand transforming into Shazam permanently. Later he gets an invite for \nArticle X by Alan Scott which is actually a Superhero Draft. He joins most of Earth\u2019s heroes in the JLA\u2019s Hall of Justice.\n</p><p>After the activation of the Anti-Life Equation, Freddy fights his way to Khandaq to reach Black Adam to have him rejoin The Marvel Family, only for Black Adam to tell him he was unsure as the New Gods have overthrown the Lords of Magic and that as their champions they are at their weakest. Ultimately, Black Adam agreed to help, and joined Freddy and Tawny during the assault on Bludhaven. Almost immediately, Adam begins trying to kill Mary, who was part of Darkseid\u2019s forces. Adam said he looked into her eyes and didn\u2019t see Mary, but a leering old man. Throwing Adam aside, Mary attacked Freddy, saying that she had a new magic word.\n As the battle continued, Mary focused her attentions on Supergirl, but \nFreddy was able to grab Mary and shout \u201cShazam\u201d, changing them both and \nsuppressing Desaad. Now in control again, Mary was horrified at her \nactions, saying she could never change back again, as Freddy told her it\n wasn\u2019t her fault.\n</p><p>When Black Adam strips Batson of his powers as Guardian of the \nRock of Eternity, Freeman was able to continue accessing his magical \npowers. \u00a0When the wizard Shazam was revived,\n he stripped all of the Marvels of their powers, and petrified Black \nAdam and Isis. Freddy was not affected by this as his powers come \ndirectly from the lords of magic. Shazam has stated he will deal with \nFreeman but whether the Wizard Shazam will challenge the gods to \nremove/reduce or change Freeman\u2019s powers has not been dealt with. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/80e7118281724ebbe90034d4da6df079/tumblr_inline_pgswukDGNS1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\"></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Post-Brightest Day\n</b></i></h2><p>Freddy later confronted Osiris in the process of killing a group of \ngunmen and two battled, with Osiris telling Freddy that he has to \ncontinue killing people in order to free his sister Isis from her stone \nimprisonment. Freddy eventually convinced Osiris that his sister would \nnot approve of the bloodshed that he has caused and offered to help him \nfind another way to save her, but Osiris instead betrayed Freddy, using \nhis abilities to summon a mystical bolt of lightning that reverted him \nback to his human form. Freddy immediately attempted to transform back \ninto <b>Captain Marvel</b>, but was horrified to discover that he no longer \npossesses his abilities and that they were robbed from him completely. \nOsiris then departed, leaving a distraught Freddy to be frustrated over \nthe loss of his powers.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1231\" data-orig-height=\"1285\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecced032f5b0cfec7c5688ec7a6f8c3d/tumblr_inline_pgswttDaBg1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1231\" data-orig-height=\"1285\"></figure><h2><i><b>Fun Facts</b></i></h2><ul><li> Unlike Batson, Freeman does NOT receive his powers from the \nWizard Shazam but directly from the six gods as their direct champion. \nThis has allowed Freeman to continue using these magical powers after \nthe Wizard revoked Batson\u2019s powers and abilities.

Now that Batson is the controller of the Rock of Eternity,\n it is only through overcoming a series of trials and judgments that \nFreeman would regain his mystical powers and succeed Batson as <b>Captain \nMarvel</b>.\n</p><p>Stripped of his former superhuman powers, Freeman was trying to \nprove himself worthy to possess all of Batson\u2019s former power levels. \nEach of the six beings who grant their abilities to <b>Captain Marvel</b>\u2014Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury\u2014would present Freddy with a \u201ctrial\u201d,\n which Freddy would have to complete successfully in order to be granted\n with that man\u2019s particular power. If he completes all six tasks, he \nwill take on the name Shazam. Zarab Babak, a demoted necromancer, serves as Freddy\u2019s guide during his trials.\n</p><p>The current gods that give Freddy his powers are in no way related to the Olympian counterparts. They are known as the Lords of Magic, and simply share their names with them.\n</p><p>The first of these was the trial of wisdom set by Solomon. He had\n to withstand the pain of getting a magical tattoo placed upon his soul.\n The woman Rachel Zallman was Solomon himself in his mortal disguise. He\n survived the process and gained a better understanding of himself, in \ndoing so he was granted the wisdom of Solomon.<br></p><p>At the same time, however, a dark organization known as the \nCouncil of Merlin are backing their own candidate, a Creole sorceress \nnamed Sabina. If Sabina wins the trials, then the power of Shazam will be lost to the Marvel Family and she will control it.\n</p><p>The second trial, the trial of courage, was set by Achilles. He \nhad to combat against a \u201cHate Empath\u201d which fed on the hatred of the \npeople in the middle east. With the help of Achilles in the mortal \ndisguise of a soldier he defeated the Empathic demon, though not before \nSabina shot Achilles in his heel, killing him. Though Achilles didn\u2019t \ntruly die but moved on to the next great warrior. For his effort he was \ngranted his <b>Captain Marvel </b>red and yellow outfit and the courage of \nAchilles.\n</p><p>The third trial, the trial of strength, is set by Hercules. He \nhas to find a way of breaking Hercules out of jail, who in his mortal \ndisguise faced off against Medusa and her minions in the form of a gang \nof yakuza. He inadvertently killed passing innocents thus breaking the \nmagical covenant for a being of his rank. Fate punished him by making \nHercules mortal and thus he was subject to their rules, which meant jail\n time as well. Putting Freddy in a hard position before he could make \nhis decision Sabina in disguise as a lawyer brought the head of Medusa \nout to paralyze Hercules then forced him to bestow her with his power. \nHercules did so but apparently doesn\u2019t take kindly to thieves so Sabine \nis only given half the power. \u00a0Hercules then bestows \u00a0the other HALF of \nthe Strength of Hercules to Freddy. Sabina and Freddy fight but are \nevenly matched. After she teleports away before Freddy can take his \nwinning shot, Hercules says he passes the trail but he can only truly be\n capable of all the power after he defeats Sabina. \u00a0\n</p><p>The fourth trial, a trial of stamina to be set by Atlas never \ntakes place. Sabina teleported deep underground to where Atlas held up \nthe world and killed him with the Dagger of Three Faults to steal his \npower. Upon finding him Zareb has Freddy take Atlas\u2019s place which Freddy\n reluctantly does. \u00a0However and taking on the role is to much to bare, \nfor the 3 minutes he wears the helm of Atlas seems like months to him, \nluckily <b>Marvel</b> comes and relieves him but not before warning him that he\n can only be away from the Rock of Eternity for 24 hours. Freddy and \nZareb then go to a local hospital to speak to the mortal disguise of Apollo,\n so that he may take Atlas\u2019 place as the next in line. Apollo refuses \nbut then decides on giving Freddy his trial, a simple fight if he loses \nhis life is forfeit and if Freddy wins he gets Apollos\u2019 power. They \nfight while elsewhere Sabina takes control of the Council of Merlin. \nWhen lives of innocent are put into danger Apollo saves them and relents\n to become the new holder of the world. In becoming a god again he \nrelinquished his mortal life as if it never happened, with the \nrealization Apollo upset over his loss of mortal life, thus Freddy has \nbeen bestowed with only HALF of the Healing of Apollo. Only truly \ncapable of all the power after he gets a replacement for him as Atlas\u2019s \nreplacement.\n</p><p>The fifth trail of speed set by Mercury also never takes place. \nSabina killed hundreds of elves to learn a piece of information to find \nMercury, she then tore through a couple more people to get the rest of \nthe information. All this led to Tawky Tawny\n who fights Sabina and has the upper hand until his inclination to talk \ngave her a the necessary information she needed to take him down. Before\n she could do so Mercury revealed himself just as Freddy arrived forcing\n him and Sabina to go after him. At this point Freddy lost on options \nfor the trials he was failing calls along with Marvel and Zareb on the Shadowpact and Zatanna\n for aid in searching for Mercury in the hopes that he finds him so the \nSabina doesn\u2019t. Meanwhile Sabina and the Council of Merlin find \nMercury\u2019s mortal children and threaten their lives forcing Mercury out \nof hiding. He succeeds in using his speed to save his daughter but his \nson is chained to Sabina and she uses the Dagger of Three Faults to take\n his power. Without the power they are on equal footing, thus Freddy \nplays the last card he has and calls on on the Justice League of America for help.\n</p><p>The sixth trail of power set by Zeus. <b>Marvel</b> and Freddy knowing \nfull well that if Sabina gets the power of Zeus she can take the rest \nfrom Freddy. Though at the same time they know Zeus will never give her \nthe power willingly so she has to magically compel him to do it. The \nonly way for her to do so is by using old magic, namely a Blood Spell, \nshe has to sacrifice one million people. Meanwhile Sabina and the \nCouncil of Merlin asks for the backing of Merlin himself in return \nSabina as the Acolyte of the powers of Shazam promises to be Merlins\u2019 \nChampion and corporeal anchor to the earth realm. In the battle a portal\n opens in Las Vegas and demons pour through killing all in their path \nand transforming them in to demons as well. The spell is two fold if one\n million souls are killed and taken then Merlin gains a foothold in this\n reality and is then empowered to compel Zeus to award the powers of \nShazam to Sabina. The Justice League fights the demons and Freddy fights\n one on one with Sabina, and tells her of his plan is to allow her to \nbeat him up so he can get her closer to the immersion portal she opened.\n If he throws them both through the one way portal they will be \ndestroyed and all the suffering she has caused that day will be undone. \nThis will also cause the powers of Shazam to be lost to all. \u00a0Freddy \nsees this as more fitting then allowing her and evil to wield them and \ndestroy the Earth. In making this decision of self-sacrifice and bravery\n Freddy has appeased the Fates and Zareb revealed himself as Zeus. \nHaving witnessed all of Freddy\u2019s trials Zeus, as Lord of the Gods of \nMagic and Gatekeeper of the Power of Shazam, gives Freddy his power and \nbestows upon Freddy the remaining powers from he other gods stolen by Sabina.\n In saying \u201cShazam\u201d Freddy is bestowed the full power of Shazam and \nSabina is sent flying into the Emergsion portal destroying her army of \ndemons and her.\n</p><p>Afterwards, Freddy talks to Zeus/Zareb, who explains that he \nneeded an anchor to the Realm of Earth. In Freddy proving himself, Zeus \ncould reclaim his Terran province, So that he may return to his full \npower. Freddy apologizes for giving him a hard time during the trials to\n which Zeus says it wouldn\u2019t have been as much fun. Zeus tells him that \nhis days of chasing criminals are secondary, he is now needed to protect\n the world, to keep the darkness at bay. To keep magic in balance.\n</p><p>At some point after the Trials of Shazam, Freddy helps the Justice Society of America track down Black Adam with Mr. Terrific\u2019s T-Spheres testing Freddy\u2019s magic lightning signature. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/373681283afb3868309dfbe620887536/tumblr_inline_pgswt0YSc71qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"955\" data-orig-height=\"1141\"></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Cry for Justice\n</b></i></h2><p><b>Captain Marvel</b> joined the splinter faction of Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen\u2019s Justice League in search of the villain Prometheus.

He then contemplates about asking Black Adam for help \nand transforming into Shazam permanently. Later he gets an invite for \nArticle X by Alan Scott which is actually a Superhero Draft. He joins most of Earth\u2019s heroes in the JLA\u2019s Hall of Justice.\n</p><p>After the activation of the Anti-Life Equation, Freddy fights his way to Khandaq to reach Black Adam to have him rejoin The Marvel Family, only for Black Adam to tell him he was unsure as the New Gods have overthrown the Lords of Magic and that as their champions they are at their weakest. Ultimately, Black Adam agreed to help, and joined Freddy and Tawny during the assault on Bludhaven. Almost immediately, Adam begins trying to kill Mary, who was part of Darkseid\u2019s forces. Adam said he looked into her eyes and didn\u2019t see Mary, but a leering old man. Throwing Adam aside, Mary attacked Freddy, saying that she had a new magic word.\n As the battle continued, Mary focused her attentions on Supergirl, but \nFreddy was able to grab Mary and shout \u201cShazam\u201d, changing them both and \nsuppressing Desaad. Now in control again, Mary was horrified at her \nactions, saying she could never change back again, as Freddy told her it\n wasn\u2019t her fault.\n</p><p>When Black Adam strips Batson of his powers as Guardian of the \nRock of Eternity, Freeman was able to continue accessing his magical \npowers. \u00a0When the wizard Shazam was revived,\n he stripped all of the Marvels of their powers, and petrified Black \nAdam and Isis. Freddy was not affected by this as his powers come \ndirectly from the lords of magic. Shazam has stated he will deal with \nFreeman but whether the Wizard Shazam will challenge the gods to \nremove/reduce or change Freeman\u2019s powers has not been dealt with. <br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/80e7118281724ebbe90034d4da6df079/tumblr_inline_pgswukDGNS1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1264\" data-orig-height=\"1920\"></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Post-Brightest Day\n</b></i></h2><p>Freddy later confronted Osiris in the process of killing a group of \ngunmen and two battled, with Osiris telling Freddy that he has to \ncontinue killing people in order to free his sister Isis from her stone \nimprisonment.

He started a new life in New York, during which he joins the Titans team. He even saved Chain Lightning from a suicide attempt. A possible romance of Argent with Freddy was explored, but after a particularly horrible date, it was abandoned.\n</p><p>At this time, Junior first began calling himself &ldquo;CM3&Prime;, so that\n he could identify himself without changing&mdash;he converts from the human \nFreeman to his superpowered form by saying &ldquo;<b>Captain Marvel</b>&rdquo;.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c13f3dd40d074b49da84eb1df7551ca3/tumblr_inline_pgswpvxT2o1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Outsiders to Infinite Crisis\n</b></i></h2><p>Beginning in 2004, Junior once again went by the name &ldquo;Captain Marvel\n Junior&rdquo;, and now wears a white cape like that of the other \ntwo Marvels instead of his traditional red one.\n</p><p>Captain Marvel, Jr. made a guest appearance to battle a new version of Sabbac, an old Fawcett Marvel Family foe.

One year later, Captain Marvel, Jr. is no longer a member of the Outsiders. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0b91aba1a97ac1a55f26e83d8fd3445/tumblr_inline_pgswp29kCT1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>The Trials of Shazam!\n</b></i></h2><p>When the wizard Shazam was killed, his and Mary&rsquo;s mystical powers were revoked. Now that Batson is the controller of the Rock of Eternity,\n it is only through overcoming a series of trials and judgments that \nFreeman would regain his mystical powers and succeed Batson as <b>Captain \nMarvel</b>.\n</p><p>Stripped of his former superhuman powers, Freeman was trying to \nprove himself worthy to possess all of Batson&rsquo;s former power levels. \nEach of the six beings who grant their abilities to <b>Captain Marvel</b>&mdash;Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury&mdash;would present Freddy with a &ldquo;trial&rdquo;,\n which Freddy would have to complete successfully in order to be granted\n with that man&rsquo;s particular power. If he completes all six tasks, he \nwill take on the name Shazam. Zarab Babak, a demoted necromancer, serves as Freddy&rsquo;s guide during his trials.\n</p><p>The current gods that give Freddy his powers are in no way related to the Olympian counterparts. They are known as the Lords of Magic, and simply share their names with them.\n</p><p>The first of these was the trial of wisdom set by Solomon. He had\n to withstand the pain of getting a magical tattoo placed upon his soul.\n The woman Rachel Zallman was Solomon himself in his mortal disguise. He\n survived the process and gained a better understanding of himself, in \ndoing so he was granted the wisdom of Solomon.<br /></p><p>At the same time, however, a dark organization known as the \nCouncil of Merlin are backing their own candidate, a Creole sorceress \nnamed Sabina. If Sabina wins the trials, then the power of Shazam will be lost to the Marvel Family and she will control it.\n</p><p>The second trial, the trial of courage, was set by Achilles. He \nhad to combat against a &ldquo;Hate Empath&rdquo; which fed on the hatred of the \npeople in the middle east. With the help of Achilles in the mortal \ndisguise of a soldier he defeated the Empathic demon, though not before \nSabina shot Achilles in his heel, killing him. Though Achilles didn&rsquo;t \ntruly die but moved on to the next great warrior. For his effort he was \ngranted his <b>Captain Marvel </b>red and yellow outfit and the courage of \nAchilles.\n</p><p>The third trial, the trial of strength, is set by Hercules. He \nhas to find a way of breaking Hercules out of jail, who in his mortal \ndisguise faced off against Medusa and her minions in the form of a gang \nof yakuza. He inadvertently killed passing innocents thus breaking the \nmagical covenant for a being of his rank. Fate punished him by making \nHercules mortal and thus he was subject to their rules, which meant jail\n time as well. Putting Freddy in a hard position before he could make \nhis decision Sabina in disguise as a lawyer brought the head of Medusa \nout to paralyze Hercules then forced him to bestow her with his power. \nHercules did so but apparently doesn&rsquo;t take kindly to thieves so Sabine \nis only given half the power. &nbsp;Hercules then bestows &nbsp;the other HALF of \nthe Strength of Hercules to Freddy. Sabina and Freddy fight but are \nevenly matched. After she teleports away before Freddy can take his \nwinning shot, Hercules says he passes the trail but he can only truly be\n capable of all the power after he defeats Sabina. &nbsp;\n</p><p>The fourth trial, a trial of stamina to be set by Atlas never \ntakes place. Sabina teleported deep underground to where Atlas held up \nthe world and killed him with the Dagger of Three Faults to steal his \npower. Upon finding him Zareb has Freddy take Atlas&rsquo;s place which Freddy\n reluctantly does. &nbsp;However and taking on the role is to much to bare, \nfor the 3 minutes he wears the helm of Atlas seems like months to him, \nluckily <b>Marvel</b> comes and relieves him but not before warning him that he\n can only be away from the Rock of Eternity for 24 hours. Freddy and \nZareb then go to a local hospital to speak to the mortal disguise of Apollo,\n so that he may take Atlas&rsquo; place as the next in line. Apollo refuses \nbut then decides on giving Freddy his trial, a simple fight if he loses \nhis life is forfeit and if Freddy wins he gets Apollos&rsquo; power. They \nfight while elsewhere Sabina takes control of the Council of Merlin. \nWhen lives of innocent are put into danger Apollo saves them and relents\n to become the new holder of the world. In becoming a god again he \nrelinquished his mortal life as if it never happened, with the \nrealization Apollo upset over his loss of mortal life, thus Freddy has \nbeen bestowed with only HALF of the Healing of Apollo. Only truly \ncapable of all the power after he gets a replacement for him as Atlas&rsquo;s \nreplacement.\n</p><p>The fifth trail of speed set by Mercury also never takes place. \nSabina killed hundreds of elves to learn a piece of information to find \nMercury, she then tore through a couple more people to get the rest of \nthe information. All this led to Tawky Tawny\n who fights Sabina and has the upper hand until his inclination to talk \ngave her a the necessary information she needed to take him down. Before\n she could do so Mercury revealed himself just as Freddy arrived forcing\n him and Sabina to go after him. At this point Freddy lost on options \nfor the trials he was failing calls along with Marvel and Zareb on the Shadowpact and Zatanna\n for aid in searching for Mercury in the hopes that he finds him so the \nSabina doesn&rsquo;t. Meanwhile Sabina and the Council of Merlin find \nMercury&rsquo;s mortal children and threaten their lives forcing Mercury out \nof hiding. He succeeds in using his speed to save his daughter but his \nson is chained to Sabina and she uses the Dagger of Three Faults to take\n his power. Without the power they are on equal footing, thus Freddy \nplays the last card he has and calls on on the Justice League of America for help.\n</p><p>The sixth trail of power set by Zeus. <b>Marvel</b> and Freddy knowing \nfull well that if Sabina gets the power of Zeus she can take the rest \nfrom Freddy. Though at the same time they know Zeus will never give her \nthe power willingly so she has to magically compel him to do it. The \nonly way for her to do so is by using old magic, namely a Blood Spell, \nshe has to sacrifice one million people. Meanwhile Sabina and the \nCouncil of Merlin asks for the backing of Merlin himself in return \nSabina as the Acolyte of the powers of Shazam promises to be Merlins&rsquo; \nChampion and corporeal anchor to the earth realm. In the battle a portal\n opens in Las Vegas and demons pour through killing all in their path \nand transforming them in to demons as well. The spell is two fold if one\n million souls are killed and taken then Merlin gains a foothold in this\n reality and is then empowered to compel Zeus to award the powers of \nShazam to Sabina. The Justice League fights the demons and Freddy fights\n one on one with Sabina, and tells her of his plan is to allow her to \nbeat him up so he can get her closer to the immersion portal she opened.\n If he throws them both through the one way portal they will be \ndestroyed and all the suffering she has caused that day will be undone. \nThis will also cause the powers of Shazam to be lost to all. &nbsp;Freddy \nsees this as more fitting then allowing her and evil to wield them and \ndestroy the Earth. In making this decision of self-sacrifice and bravery\n Freddy has appeased the Fates and Zareb revealed himself as Zeus. \nHaving witnessed all of Freddy&rsquo;s trials Zeus, as Lord of the Gods of \nMagic and Gatekeeper of the Power of Shazam, gives Freddy his power and \nbestows upon Freddy the remaining powers from he other gods stolen by Sabina.\n In saying &ldquo;Shazam&rdquo; Freddy is bestowed the full power of Shazam and \nSabina is sent flying into the Emergsion portal destroying her army of \ndemons and her.\n</p><p>Afterwards, Freddy talks to Zeus/Zareb, who explains that he \nneeded an anchor to the Realm of Earth. In Freddy proving himself, Zeus \ncould reclaim his Terran province, So that he may return to his full \npower. Freddy apologizes for giving him a hard time during the trials to\n which Zeus says it wouldn&rsquo;t have been as much fun. Zeus tells him that \nhis days of chasing criminals are secondary, he is now needed to protect\n the world, to keep the darkness at bay. To keep magic in balance.\n</p><p>At some point after the Trials of Shazam, Freddy helps the Justice Society of America track down Black Adam with Mr. Terrific&rsquo;s T-Spheres testing Freddy&rsquo;s magic lightning signature. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/373681283afb3868309dfbe620887536/tumblr_inline_pgswt0YSc71qbv7u8_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Cry for Justice\n</b></i></h2><p><b>Captain Marvel</b> joined the splinter faction of Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen&rsquo;s Justice League in search of the villain Prometheus.

He then contemplates about asking Black Adam for help \nand transforming into Shazam permanently. Later he gets an invite for \nArticle X by Alan Scott which is actually a Superhero Draft. He joins most of Earth&rsquo;s heroes in the JLA&rsquo;s Hall of Justice.\n</p><p>After the activation of the Anti-Life Equation, Freddy fights his way to Khandaq to reach Black Adam to have him rejoin The Marvel Family, only for Black Adam to tell him he was unsure as the New Gods have overthrown the Lords of Magic and that as their champions they are at their weakest. Ultimately, Black Adam agreed to help, and joined Freddy and Tawny during the assault on Bludhaven. Almost immediately, Adam begins trying to kill Mary, who was part of Darkseid&rsquo;s forces. Adam said he looked into her eyes and didn&rsquo;t see Mary, but a leering old man. Throwing Adam aside, Mary attacked Freddy, saying that she had a new magic word.\n As the battle continued, Mary focused her attentions on Supergirl, but \nFreddy was able to grab Mary and shout &ldquo;Shazam&rdquo;, changing them both and \nsuppressing Desaad. Now in control again, Mary was horrified at her \nactions, saying she could never change back again, as Freddy told her it\n wasn&rsquo;t her fault.\n</p><p>When Black Adam strips Batson of his powers as Guardian of the \nRock of Eternity, Freeman was able to continue accessing his magical \npowers. &nbsp;When the wizard Shazam was revived,\n he stripped all of the Marvels of their powers, and petrified Black \nAdam and Isis. Freddy was not affected by this as his powers come \ndirectly from the lords of magic. Shazam has stated he will deal with \nFreeman but whether the Wizard Shazam will challenge the gods to \nremove/reduce or change Freeman&rsquo;s powers has not been dealt with. <br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/80e7118281724ebbe90034d4da6df079/tumblr_inline_pgswukDGNS1qbv7u8_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><h2>\n<i><b>Post-Brightest Day\n</b></i></h2><p>Freddy later confronted Osiris in the process of killing a group of \ngunmen and two battled, with Osiris telling Freddy that he has to \ncontinue killing people in order to free his sister Isis from her stone \nimprisonment. Freddy eventually convinced Osiris that his sister would \nnot approve of the bloodshed that he has caused and offered to help him \nfind another way to save her, but Osiris instead betrayed Freddy, using \nhis abilities to summon a mystical bolt of lightning that reverted him \nback to his human form.
