Harry, who had enough memories of sneaking in and out the corridors of the castle found that to be both pleasing and comforting. Somewhere between his years of fighting his whims and being realistic had produced the current shame he felt. It had been hard from having to deal with being the Boy-Who-Lived, and to Harry have in managed to wedge himself into contact with Draco Malfoy, and not in the usual kind. They had been insulting each other, but one day when they had met each other without a crowd his Gryffindor mouth did a number on him. </p><p>In midst their argument, Malfoy had told him to fuck himself.
