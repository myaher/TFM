The druid Keyleth jumps incautiously off a cliff over the ocean and realizes she is falling towards the slope of the cliff face. She uses Gust to push herself out but is still heading towards the rocks at the foot of the cliff. She turns herself into a goldfish, hits the rock, takes 360 points of fall damage, and is insta-killed]</p><p>OK, so, there are a few things going on here. I do actually think Matt made the correct call here according to physics, biology, and the rules of 5th Edition. However&hellip;. there are lots of cases where I think the 5e rules handle fall damage poorly, and size Tiny creatures absolutely fall into that category. There was a way for Keyleth to use the goldfish beast shape here that would have accomplished what she was trying to do.</p><p><b>Topics Explored Below Cut:</b></p><p>1. Let\u2019s talk about what terminal velocity is<br/>2. Size tiny creatures have low terminal velocity and a high surface area to volume ratio<br/>3. Tiny creatures can survive falls from remarkable heights<br/>3a.

It\u2019s probably more helpful than reading this explanation, and you should totally check it out. In short, an animal\u2019s size makes a huge difference in how well it survives a fall because of two things:</p><p>1. terminal velocity</p><p>2. surface area to volume ratio</p><p>1. <b>Terminal velocity</b> will be familiar to people who have seen my post about fall distance.\u00a0 When you start to fall, gravity makes you accelerate, falling faster and faster over time.\u00a0 As your speed/velocity increases, the air pushes back against you (just like when you put your hand out a car window, you feel more\u00a0\u201cwind\u201d the faster the car is moving). At a certain point (different for every creature or object) that push, known as\u00a0\u201cair friction\u201d or\u00a0\u201cdrag,\u201d is enough to equal the pull of gravity and you stop accelerating and hit a steady downward speed, known as your terminal velocity. (FYI: if you are a typical human being in that skydiver jumping jack position, your body\u2019s terminal velocity is probably around 120 mph)</p><p>Objects with a high weight and a small surface area (like smooth rocks, or cannonballs) have high terminal velocities. Objects with low weights and large surface areas, like balloons or bedsheets, have low terminal velocities. Their\u00a0\u201ctop speed\u201d is much slower. In general, the larger an animal is, the faster its terminal velocity will be. An ant falls much more slowly than a mouse, which falls more slowly than a human, which falls more slowly than a whale.\u00a0 An ant will hit the ground much more gently than a human will.</p><p>[<b>sidenote: \u201cterminal\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdeadly\u201d</b> in this case. While terminal velocity for some species can be fatal, that\u2019s not necessarily the case for all and it\u2019s not why it\u2019s called that. It\u2019s\u00a0\u201cterminal\u201d in the sense of being the final speed you always eventually reach if you fall long enough]</p><p>2. <b>Surface area to volume ratio</b> is a little harder to explain. Basically, it describes how much outside you have compared to your inside. Think of it like making a cake where you keep doubling the recipe; if you triple the amount of batter (the volume of the inside) the amount of icing you need to cover the outside (the surface area) might only be double what you needed for the original cake. Also, your cake might taste too cake-y and not enough icing-y because the ratio is messed up and there\u2019s too much cake that\u2019s way too far from any delicious icing.<br/>[<b>Skippable Math Justification</b>: remember that the equation for the volume of a shape usually has the radius <i>cubed</i>, but the surface area for the same shape will have the radius\u00a0<i>squared.\u00a0 </i>The bigger an object or creature gets, the less outside it has compared to the amount of inside if it keeps the same shape.]</p><p>Surface area to volume ratio is important in biology for lots of reasons (two big ones are how much heat you retain and how easily you can get nutrients into your body), but one really important one is <b>how sturdy and tough a creature is</b>. In general, smaller creatures have more support compared to the amount of weight/inside volume/squishy stuff they have, and that makes them tougher against gravity and crushing pressure. Think about how difficult it is to crush a flea with a magazine compared to how easily the much larger housefly squishes. This is also why whales can get so big in the ocean but die on land; their size is so great that they are pretty vulnerable to their own weight.</p><p><b>Why You Should Care</b><br/>Okay, so what does this have to do with Keyleth?\u00a0 Well, for many real-world tiny creatures, their slow terminal velocity combined with their great toughness for their weight means that they literally can\u2019t be dropped from high enough to kill them. You could drop an ant off a cliff and it would not hit the ground hard enough to really care. I got interested in this topic last year and went looking for information on how different species perform when falling from great heights (Sidenote: be careful googling this if animal cruelty upsets you; people suck). <b><br/></b></p><p><b>Rough breakdown of IRL fall damage from great heights:</b> <br/><b>Most insects</b>: fine with basically whatever. <br/><b>Mouse</b>: soft surface usually fine, hard surface 50-50.\u00a0 <br/><b>Smaller fish</b>: fine into water, sometimes die if they hit land.\u00a0 <br/><b>Rat or ferret</b>: 50-50 on soft surface, usually die on hard one. <br/><b>Cats:</b>\u00a0sometimes die but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21G1i5Uwd7o\" target=\"_blank\">survive very high falls more often than shorter ones</a><br/><b>Anything bigger than a cat:</b>\u00a0going to die more often than not<br/><b>Humans:</b> mostly die from terminal velocity falls, but a few of us have made it<br/><b>Horse or elephant:</b> is never going to survive that.</p><p><b>Back to Keyleth</b><br/>So, Keyleth picked a form (goldfish) that had a pretty good chance of surviving a fall from a great height. Obviously aiming for the water would have been better. However, even on the rocks she might have stood a chance because her terminal velocity would have been so much lower and her surface-area-to-volume ratio would have been pretty good.\u00a0 Her fatal error: she waited until the last minute to shift forms, meaning that she was traveling at full human terminal velocity when she struck down on rock. This is not a case of dropping a goldfish off a cliff; in the real world you would have to fire a goldfish out of a cannon to get that speed downward. So, Mercer was correct in this case, but I stand by the assessment that the rules aren\u2019t written in a way that accommodates terminal velocity.</p><p><b>Heavy-duty Most Accurate Rules I Don\u2019t Really Recommend:</b><br/><b>Tiny</b> creatures are exempt from fall damage altogether if they were tiny for the duration of the fall<br/><b>Small</b> creatures take d4s (note that this includes gnomes and halflings)<br/><b>Medium</b> creatures take d6s<br/><b>Large</b> creatures take d10s<br/><b>Huge or larger</b> creatures go unconscious with 0 HP immediately if they free fall more than 20 feet.<br/>(<b>caveat</b>: something like a Roc that flies with wings is only going to truly free fall if it\u2019s unconscious or its wings have been removed; even if its wings are damaged it\u2019s going to attempt to use them to slow down rather than face certain death. Use normal fall damage if they\u2019re conscious and their wings are still attached to their body)\u00a0<br/>(I wouldn\u2019t actually use these, but they\u2019re more accurate)</p><p><b>Quick and Dirty Rules:</b>\u00a0Give fall damage as normal EXCEPT: <br/><b>Tiny</b> creatures take no fall damage,<br/><b>Huge or larger</b> creatures go unconscious with 0 HP immediately if they free-fall from more than 20 feet. For winged creatures apply normal fall damage unless wings are removed or creature is paralyzed.</p><p><b>Practical Upshot:</b>\u00a0If my druid beast-shaped to an ant or a spider and leapt off a cliff I wouldn\u2019t make them take damage. If the rogue used his scroll of mass polymorph to turn them all into spiders I would let them all make the jump safely. If Keyleth had turned into a goldfish at the start of her fall I would probably have let her live, although she might have been stunned for a little bit by the rocks.</p>",

It\u2019s\u00a0\u201cterminal\u201d in the sense of being the final speed you always eventually reach if you fall long enough]</p><p>2. <b>Surface area to volume ratio</b> is a little harder to explain. Basically, it describes how much outside you have compared to your inside. Think of it like making a cake where you keep doubling the recipe; if you triple the amount of batter (the volume of the inside) the amount of icing you need to cover the outside (the surface area) might only be double what you needed for the original cake. Also, your cake might taste too cake-y and not enough icing-y because the ratio is messed up and there\u2019s too much cake that\u2019s way too far from any delicious icing.<br>[<b>Skippable Math Justification</b>: remember that the equation for the volume of a shape usually has the radius <i>cubed</i>, but the surface area for the same shape will have the radius\u00a0<i>squared.\u00a0 </i>The bigger an object or creature gets, the less outside it has compared to the amount of inside if it keeps the same shape.]</p><p>Surface area to volume ratio is important in biology for lots of reasons (two big ones are how much heat you retain and how easily you can get nutrients into your body), but one really important one is <b>how sturdy and tough a creature is</b>. In general, smaller creatures have more support compared to the amount of weight/inside volume/squishy stuff they have, and that makes them tougher against gravity and crushing pressure. Think about how difficult it is to crush a flea with a magazine compared to how easily the much larger housefly squishes. This is also why whales can get so big in the ocean but die on land; their size is so great that they are pretty vulnerable to their own weight.</p><p><b>Why You Should Care</b><br>Okay, so what does this have to do with Keyleth?\u00a0 Well, for many real-world tiny creatures, their slow terminal velocity combined with their great toughness for their weight means that they literally can\u2019t be dropped from high enough to kill them. You could drop an ant off a cliff and it would not hit the ground hard enough to really care.

It&rsquo;s probably more helpful than reading this explanation, and you should totally check it out. In short, an animal&rsquo;s size makes a huge difference in how well it survives a fall because of two things:</p><p>1. terminal velocity</p><p>2. surface area to volume ratio</p><p>1. <b>Terminal velocity</b> will be familiar to people who have seen my post about fall distance.&nbsp; When you start to fall, gravity makes you accelerate, falling faster and faster over time.&nbsp; As your speed/velocity increases, the air pushes back against you (just like when you put your hand out a car window, you feel more&nbsp;&ldquo;wind&rdquo; the faster the car is moving). At a certain point (different for every creature or object) that push, known as&nbsp;&ldquo;air friction&rdquo; or&nbsp;&ldquo;drag,&rdquo; is enough to equal the pull of gravity and you stop accelerating and hit a steady downward speed, known as your terminal velocity. (FYI: if you are a typical human being in that skydiver jumping jack position, your body&rsquo;s terminal velocity is probably around 120 mph)</p><p>Objects with a high weight and a small surface area (like smooth rocks, or cannonballs) have high terminal velocities. Objects with low weights and large surface areas, like balloons or bedsheets, have low terminal velocities. Their&nbsp;&ldquo;top speed&rdquo; is much slower. In general, the larger an animal is, the faster its terminal velocity will be. An ant falls much more slowly than a mouse, which falls more slowly than a human, which falls more slowly than a whale.&nbsp; An ant will hit the ground much more gently than a human will.</p><p>[<b>sidenote: &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;deadly&rdquo;</b> in this case. While terminal velocity for some species can be fatal, that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case for all and it&rsquo;s not why it&rsquo;s called that.
