        "body": "<p>I need to make a post because I somehow fell into the crazy section of the Game of Thrones fandom that seems to still think Sansa is evil and also that Arya is going to kill her and replace her with Daenerys as a new sister? And I know that these theories are stupid and I really don\u2019t have to acknowledge them, but I\u2019m angry so I\u2019m gonna.</p><p>Disclaimer: The Stark sisters are both in my top five favorite characters on Game of Thrones. So before ANYONE comes at me with that\u00a0\u2018your biased against one of them\u2019 shit, back right the fuck away. Some of you have this weird conception that\u00a0\u2018Sansa stans all hate Arya\u2019. And you\u2019re&hellip;wrong. In the beginning, Arya was my favorite character and I didn\u2019t like Sansa one bit. But that was because I had a lot of internalized misogyny going on that told me that the only strong female characters are ones that fight and kill things and are\u00a0\u2018not like other girls\u2019. I\u2019ve gotten over that now, so now I love them both to the moon and back and you can all fight me.</p><p>So. Let\u2019s revisit the Stark sister fight, shall we?</p><p>Season seven. The sisters fight. And the writing&hellip;was bad. It was clearly all engineered to give us a surprise twist ending in which Sansa and Arya fooled Littlefinger. Everyone knew it right from the beginning. It was just trying to give us some pointless drama. Now at it\u2019s LEAST annoying, this arc was just a poorly written fake out in which the Stark sisters were secretly playing Littlefinger the whole time. With that reading, it isn\u2019t well done, but at least it doesn\u2019t involve a gross mischaracterization of the Stark sisters.</p><p>However, according to some reports of deleted scenes, old scripts, etc. it\u2019s possible that Sansa and Arya WERE both fooled and it was only Bran that kept them from having a true falling out. Which is dumb. it\u2019s dumb as hell. Sansa knows not to trust Littlefinger and ARYA just spent a bunch of time learning from a super secret assassin club. She would see bull shit written all over this.</p><p>Also there is just so much that doesn\u2019t make sense in their conversations. Arya saw Sansa absolutely sobbing and screaming on the day her father was killed and commented on her dress? She says she always wanted to wear pretty dresses? Arya is mad at Sansa for trying to blend in with the enemy when she played cup bearer to TYWIN LANNISTER and had the equivalent of an INSTA KILL which she didn\u2019t use on him? Arya couldn\u2019t have figured out that Sansa was probably forced to write that letter? Please. It\u2019s SO much bullshit.</p><p>Sansa is trying to keep peace in the north and chooses to gently shut down the slightly treasonous comment from a northern lord. It was really just an expression of doubt. She knows that hard times are coming and she can\u2019t just punish their few allies. She is in the right in this. And sure, Arya is in the right to perhaps criticize her or even raise a complaint but she would never jump to the fucking death threats. The conversation they have right after is fine! Just a little argument and differing opinions.</p><p>BUT EVEN IF YOU THINK it is ALL legitimate. Even if you think the Stark sisters really were in conflict and even if you were on Arya\u2019s side in the situation. That does not explain why some of you think that Arya and Sansa are going to be in conflict season 8. Like did you SKIP their last fucking scene? Did you just fucking SKIP IT?</p><p>Arya asks Sansa if she is okay! And gives her credit for Littlefinger\u2019s death! They talk honestly about their feelings! Arya admits she wouldn\u2019t have survived what Sansa survived and Sansa calls her the STRONGEST PERSON SHE KNOWS. Like wow, yeah, what an evil bitch Sansa is. Calling Arya the strongest person she knows. Truly. Cersei 2.0.</p><p>They share a little joke about their old sisterly animosity (sisters fight sometimes, my dudes. They tease each other. It\u2019s supposed to be cute). And then they remember their father\u2019s words\u00a0\u201cthe lone wolf dies but the pack survives\u201d.</p><p>Ned Stark was always preaching about family and he is the one who first told Arya that she needed to make up with her sister. He was the one who told her that they have to protect each other. You think Arya would dishonor her father\u2019s memory by KILLING her own SISTER? Are you DRUNK?</p><p>So when we leave off Sansa and Arya, they are sharing their feelings, they remember their father, they validate each other\u2019s struggle and they are even standing in the same place as Jon and Sansa after they took back Winterfell in season 6. This is a united front! They are going into season 8 compeltely united. That was the whole purpose of their arc! To bind them together as family again.</p><p>I just&hellip;Sansa is not the villain you want her to be guys. She just isn\u2019t. Maise, on the other hand, admitted she played Arya as a villain in that arc which&hellip;yeah she did. Her acting was very villainous (which I\u2019m fine with if it was all an act). But there is no way you can watch that last scene and think that there is any hint of the Stark sisters having a falling out. It just takes BASIC film comprehension.</p><p>The Stark sisters love each other and they have each other\u2019s backs. Arya is Sansa\u2019s blade. They are a pack. Full stop.</p>",

In the beginning, Arya was my favorite character and I didn\u2019t like Sansa one bit.

The sisters fight. And the writing\u2026was bad. It was clearly all engineered to give us a surprise twist ending in which Sansa and Arya fooled Littlefinger. Everyone knew it right from the beginning. It was just trying to give us some pointless drama. Now at it\u2019s LEAST annoying, this arc was just a poorly written fake out in which the Stark sisters were secretly playing Littlefinger the whole time. With that reading, it isn\u2019t well done, but at least it doesn\u2019t involve a gross mischaracterization of the Stark sisters.</p><p>However, according to some reports of deleted scenes, old scripts, etc. it\u2019s possible that Sansa and Arya WERE both fooled and it was only Bran that kept them from having a true falling out. Which is dumb. it\u2019s dumb as hell. Sansa knows not to trust Littlefinger and ARYA just spent a bunch of time learning from a super secret assassin club. She would see bull shit written all over this.</p><p>Also there is just so much that doesn\u2019t make sense in their conversations. Arya saw Sansa absolutely sobbing and screaming on the day her father was killed and commented on her dress? She says she always wanted to wear pretty dresses? Arya is mad at Sansa for trying to blend in with the enemy when she played cup bearer to TYWIN LANNISTER and had the equivalent of an INSTA KILL which she didn\u2019t use on him? Arya couldn\u2019t have figured out that Sansa was probably forced to write that letter? Please. It\u2019s SO much bullshit.</p><p>Sansa is trying to keep peace in the north and chooses to gently shut down the slightly treasonous comment from a northern lord. It was really just an expression of doubt. She knows that hard times are coming and she can\u2019t just punish their few allies. She is in the right in this. And sure, Arya is in the right to perhaps criticize her or even raise a complaint but she would never jump to the fucking death threats. The conversation they have right after is fine! Just a little argument and differing opinions.</p><p>BUT EVEN IF YOU THINK it is ALL legitimate.

Thankfully, season 3 dials back on the abuse and in this context, it is worth noting that Sansa is repeatedly confronted with people who, with varying degrees of honesty, either promise help her escape her abusive situation or protect her from the abuse.\u00a0If Sansa\u2019s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.</p><p>Season 3 is the season where Petyr Baelish enters Sansa\u2019s narrative in a serious and important way. He has previously interacted with her very briefly in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">season 1</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">season 2</a> - but until now she hasn\u2019t been the focus of his intrigues. From season 3 to season 7, Sansa Stark is one of the most important linchpins of Baelish\u2019s political intrigues. His actions shapes her narrative to a very large extent.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p><b>AN OFFER OF ESCAPE</b></p><p>In her very first scene of season 3 we find Sansa at a pier in the King\u2019s Landing harbour with Shae. Sansa is inventing stories for the various\nships they see but Shae doesn\u2019t really understand the purpose of this game when Sansa invites her\nto join in \u2013 why make up stories about these ships when the truth is different?\nTo which Sansa replies:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09dc83bae883cdc4788a9cbb9a3fae9d/tumblr_inline_pcuookI9Sx1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure><p>What I find\nparticularly interesting about this particular exchange is that it highlights that <b>Sansa hasn\u2019t lost her love of storytelling.\nHowever, her perception of stories (and songs) have changed.</b> Whereas the\nna\u00efve and idealistic Sansa of season 1 thought that stories and songs\ncontained the truth, the more disillusioned Sansa of season 3 sees storytelling\nas an escape from a reality that is either boring or terrible. That is very\nunderstandable since Sansa\u2019s life has been rather terrible since her father was\nkilled.<br/></p><p>Petyr\nBaelish approaches Sansa and Shae. He wants to speak with Sansa alone and when they are (somewhat) alone he reveals something important to her.</p><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>I saw your mother not long ago. She\u2019s very\neager to see you. And your sister.</i></p><p>Sansa\n(gasps): <i>Arya\u2019s alive? \u2026 You said you\nwould take me home.</i></p><p>Baelish: <i>You said King\u2019s Landing was your home.</i></p></blockquote><p>This last\nexchange is a call back to a conversation they had in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">last episode</a> of\nseason 2, after Joffrey had set Sansa aside as his betrothed. At that time\nSansa refused Baelish\u2019s offer, probably because she didn\u2019t trust him. Now,\nhowever, Baelish has found the thing that Sansa wants more than her home: her\nfamily! When he first extended his offer last season, he didn\u2019t mention that he\nhad met with Catelyn Stark, probably because he thought that the idea of home\nwas enough to get Sansa to agree to his proposal. She didn\u2019t. <b>Now, however, he skillfully dangles the\nprospect of reuniting with her family \u2013 and that is a temptation that Sansa\ncannot resist.</b> That he literally makes her beg for him to take her home\nmust be very gratifying for Baelish, especially since she initially refused\nhim.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef2601ac15bfe513fe17491769403110/tumblr_inline_pcuoq5B73I1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>You are the property of the Crown. Stealing\nyou would be treason. If you were to tell just one person\u2026</i></p><p>Sansa: <i>I won\u2019t tell anyone.</i></p><p>Baelish: <i>How do I know?</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa\nthrows his own words from season 2 back in his face. Now she sounds desperate.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Because I\u2019m a terrible liar. You said so\nyourself. \u2026 Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere they once again enter <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">the dynamic</a> that season 1 established between them:\nBaelish is making Sansa keep secrets through the implied threat of bodily harm\n(though always from persons other than him). This is a dynamic that we\u2019ll see\nplay out again and again as Baelish draws Sansa into more and more dangerous\nsecrets and it offers him a way to control her and make her dependent on him.\nHe enjoys the power that Sansa\u2019s desperation gives him and now he gives a\nlittle performance of hesitance to make her even more desperate.<br/></p><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>I\u2019m waiting for word on an assignment that\nwill take me far away from the capital.

She may end up becoming Queen, which isn\u2019t a far-fetched idea since queenship is a theme the runs through her narrative arc in the books - even after she\u2019s no longer betrothed to Joffrey. Sansa is, in many respects, a foil to Cersei and it is through Cersei that she learns how NOT to be a Queen! Neither should we forget that in the moment of crisis during the Battle of Blackwater, it was Sansa who <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">stepped up</a> and performed Cersei\u2019s role when the latter abandoned her duties.</p><p>Ros is leading\nthe conversation with Shae, perhaps fishing for information now that she works for\nVarys, but when Baelish turns and walks towards them, Ros issues a quick warning:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7870b66255493388f1a1201e9764562/tumblr_inline_pcuowjmZbJ1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Ros (to\nShae): <i>Watch out for her.</i><br/></p><p>Shae: <i>I always do.</i><br/></p><p>Ros: <i>Watch out for her with him.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\ninteresting that Ros gives this particular warning \u2013 what is her reason for\ntrying to look out for Sansa? Is it simply because she grew up near Winterfell or is there something more in play? We never get an answer to this question but I do find it interesting that this low-born prostitute cares enough to warn Sansa\u2019s maid about Baelish\u2019s nefarious interest in the aristocratic girl.<br/></p><p>The scene\nends with a shot of Sansa with her back to the camera, standing very still and\nlooking out at the sea. We cannot read her emotions because we don\u2019t have\naccess to her face. Thus, we have to imagine what she thinks and feels.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"315\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ba9a6a3ce5e6163ec101c472534dac07/tumblr_inline_pcuozoKHPR1uklhai_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"560\" data-orig-height=\"315\"/></figure><p>In this\nrespect, the image composition is interesting because a figure, seen from behind, looking out at something\nis often used as a device for a heightened submersion into the motif on the part of\nthe spectator:<br/></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c\u2026the presence of static figures, seen from\nbehind [\u2026] permits the spectator a maximum of empathy, for he can easily take\nhis place beside or within these faceless beings\u2026\u201d</i> (Robert Rosenblum, <i>Modern Painting and the Northern Romantic Tradition</i>)</p></blockquote><p>Furthermore, in the history of art, images of a figure looking out at the sea or a harbor with their back turned to\nthe spectator has often been used to convey longing, fx for travel or adventure.\nThus, it is not far-fetched to interpret this image of Sansa as her being submerged in a moment of longing for home, now that her hopes have been raised.</p><p>After this\nfinal shot of Sansa, looking out at the sea with longing, the screen\u00a0 transitions\nto a scene on the open sea where Daenerys travels towards Astapor while her\ndragons fly free around the ship. In television and cinema, editing is an extremely important narrative device and it can carry a lot of meaning. Whilst Sansa\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019 narrative arcs are completely separate from each other, this transition\nfrom a woman longing for freedom to a woman who has embarked on a journey to\ntake charge of her life and her ambitions forms a very poignant\njuxtaposition.</p><p><b>A WORRIED FRIEND</b></p><p>Sansa may have promised Baelish not to tell anyone about his plan to spirit her away from King\u2019s Landing, but in the very next episode a scene between her and Shae in her chambers reveals that Sansa has confided in her maid.\u00a0It isn\u2019t\nstated directly but it can be deduced from\nthe dialogue. <b>What I find interesting is that Sansa promised Baelish to not\ntell as soul but here we have her discussing his offer with her maid and friend \u2013 and it just\nshows how much she trusts Shae.</b></p><p>We enter the scene mid-conversation, with Sansa telling Shae that Baelish said he didn\u2019t want anything from her and that he\u2019s only offering to help her because he loved her mother.

However, later episodes of this season make it\nclear that Baelish\u2019s interest in Sansa is primarily political though he\ntransfers his obsession with Catelyn Stark onto her daughter in season 4. Sansa, on the other hand, finds Shae\u2019s insinuation rather ridiculous.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"213\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/928a8ab7580b48218050889b3cff51b0/tumblr_inline_phquzhhjG01uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"213\"/></figure><p>Sansa is\nright, he\u2019s not in love with her.

Shae is so fiercely\nmaternal in this scene \u2013 it is clear that she has taken Ros\u2019 warning to heart. As a fan\nof Sansa\u2019s character it is rather nice to see that at least one person in King\u2019s Landing is concerned about\nher welfare. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">previously written</a> about the maternal subtext that informs the way the show has written the relationship between Sansa and Shae. The genuine friendship between these two women is one of the few instances where the show improves upon the books - because female friendship is a HUGE blind-spot in GRRM\u2019s writing, which lacks any kind of positive relationships between women. I love that, in the show, Shae genuinely loves Sansa and that she is fiercely protective of her, which is confirmed when she in episode 10 angrily tells Varys:</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>I love that girl. I would kill for her.</i></p></blockquote><p>In the books, Sansa has NO true allies in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0 But having a\nmeaningful friendship with Shae doesn\u2019t really alter Sansa\u2019s general isolation at the royal court because Shae is powerless \u2013 though she actually tries to take steps to protect Sansa from Baelish by taking her worries to her lover Tyrion.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c1f38c695ab8a6518e954175bc71dd7/tumblr_inline_phmk21rZQ21uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><b>IT IS\nWORTH NOTING THAT SHAE DOES NOT REVEAL BAELISH\u2019S OFFER TO SPIRIT SANSA AWAY\nFROM THE CITY AND THE LANNISTERS!</b> Though Shae genuinely loves Tyrion, she doesn\u2019t trust him with this secret - and I cannot stress enough how important this detail is! Throughout this season, Shae repeatedly protects Sansa\u2019s secrets despite the fact that these secrets are against the interests of her lover\u2019s family. Not only does she keep Sansa\u2019s secrets, she also tries to enlist Tyrion\u2019s help in protecting her.</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>We have to protect her.</i></p><p>Tyrion: <i>We can\u2019t. Now that the Lannisters have\ndiscarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old\nname.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere the conversation about protecting Sansa is derailed by Shae\u2019s jealousy.\nShe gets angry and jealous by Tyrion finding Sansa beautiful. <b>However, Shae\nNEVER blames Sansa for Tyrion finding her beautiful, as so many stories are wont to do. Shae blames Tyrion\nfor finding Sansa attractive.</b></p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>You pervert. You want her? This child?</i></p></blockquote><p>Shae\u2019s\njealousy is rooted in her insecurity, knowing that she can never marry Tyrion.\nBut she also seems angry and disappointed that Tyrion may be attracted to a girl as\nyoung as Sansa.</p><p>This fight between Shae and Tyrion also serves to highlight the theme that comes to dominate Sansa\u2019s narrative arc in the third season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>: Marriage. With the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, Sansa is now effectively Robb Stark\u2019s heir - and that makes her an attractive prospect for a political marriage since she is, as Robb\u2019s heir, the Key to the North.</p><p><br/></p><p>To be continued&hellip;</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p><p>(A special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pTAE90uTgRi8FbzkKnz0w\">@nothinghappensinalstonville</a> for making a pair of GIFs for me)</p>",

That is very\nunderstandable since Sansa\u2019s life has been rather terrible since her father was\nkilled.<br></p><p>Petyr\nBaelish approaches Sansa and Shae.

She may end up becoming Queen, which isn\u2019t a far-fetched idea since queenship is a theme the runs through her narrative arc in the books - even after she\u2019s no longer betrothed to Joffrey. Sansa is, in many respects, a foil to Cersei and it is through Cersei that she learns how NOT to be a Queen! Neither should we forget that in the moment of crisis during the Battle of Blackwater, it was Sansa who <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">stepped up</a> and performed Cersei\u2019s role when the latter abandoned her duties.</p><p>Ros is leading\nthe conversation with Shae, perhaps fishing for information now that she works for\nVarys, but when Baelish turns and walks towards them, Ros issues a quick warning:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d7870b66255493388f1a1201e9764562/tumblr_inline_pcuowjmZbJ1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><blockquote><p>Ros (to\nShae): <i>Watch out for her.</i><br></p><p>Shae: <i>I always do.</i><br></p><p>Ros: <i>Watch out for her with him.</i></p></blockquote><p>It is\ninteresting that Ros gives this particular warning \u2013 what is her reason for\ntrying to look out for Sansa? Is it simply because she grew up near Winterfell or is there something more in play? We never get an answer to this question but I do find it interesting that this low-born prostitute cares enough to warn Sansa\u2019s maid about Baelish\u2019s nefarious interest in the aristocratic girl.<br></p><p>The scene\nends with a shot of Sansa with her back to the camera, standing very still and\nlooking out at the sea. We cannot read her emotions because we don\u2019t have\naccess to her face.

In television and cinema, editing is an extremely important narrative device and it can carry a lot of meaning. Whilst Sansa\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019 narrative arcs are completely separate from each other, this transition\nfrom a woman longing for freedom to a woman who has embarked on a journey to\ntake charge of her life and her ambitions forms a very poignant\njuxtaposition.</p><p><b>A WORRIED FRIEND</b></p><p>Sansa may have promised Baelish not to tell anyone about his plan to spirit her away from King\u2019s Landing, but in the very next episode a scene between her and Shae in her chambers reveals that Sansa has confided in her maid.\u00a0It isn\u2019t\nstated directly but it can be deduced from\nthe dialogue. <b>What I find interesting is that Sansa promised Baelish to not\ntell as soul but here we have her discussing his offer with her maid and friend \u2013 and it just\nshows how much she trusts Shae.</b></p><p>We enter the scene mid-conversation, with Sansa telling Shae that Baelish said he didn\u2019t want anything from her and that he\u2019s only offering to help her because he loved her mother. Shae is, however, not quite convinced of the purity of Baelish\u2019s intentions, courtesy of Ros\u2019 warning.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5605dbcb89bbe13409210c96128cf631/tumblr_inline_pcuovq6hHS1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"></figure><p>Shae is\njustifiably skeptical \u2013 she rightly suspects Baelish of having an agenda with\nSansa, though she thinks that Baelish\u2019s interest in Sansa is primarily sexual\n(understandable considering her background). However, later episodes of this season make it\nclear that Baelish\u2019s interest in Sansa is primarily political though he\ntransfers his obsession with Catelyn Stark onto her daughter in season 4. Sansa, on the other hand, finds Shae\u2019s insinuation rather ridiculous.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"213\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/928a8ab7580b48218050889b3cff51b0/tumblr_inline_phquzhhjG01uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"213\"></figure><p>Sansa is\nright, he\u2019s not in love with her.

Shae is so fiercely\nmaternal in this scene \u2013 it is clear that she has taken Ros\u2019 warning to heart. As a fan\nof Sansa\u2019s character it is rather nice to see that at least one person in King\u2019s Landing is concerned about\nher welfare. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">previously written</a> about the maternal subtext that informs the way the show has written the relationship between Sansa and Shae. The genuine friendship between these two women is one of the few instances where the show improves upon the books - because female friendship is a HUGE blind-spot in GRRM\u2019s writing, which lacks any kind of positive relationships between women. I love that, in the show, Shae genuinely loves Sansa and that she is fiercely protective of her, which is confirmed when she in episode 10 angrily tells Varys:</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>I love that girl. I would kill for her.</i></p></blockquote><p>In the books, Sansa has NO true allies in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0 But having a\nmeaningful friendship with Shae doesn\u2019t really alter Sansa\u2019s general isolation at the royal court because Shae is powerless \u2013 though she actually tries to take steps to protect Sansa from Baelish by taking her worries to her lover Tyrion.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c1f38c695ab8a6518e954175bc71dd7/tumblr_inline_phmk21rZQ21uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>IT IS\nWORTH NOTING THAT SHAE DOES NOT REVEAL BAELISH\u2019S OFFER TO SPIRIT SANSA AWAY\nFROM THE CITY AND THE LANNISTERS!</b> Though Shae genuinely loves Tyrion, she doesn\u2019t trust him with this secret - and I cannot stress enough how important this detail is! Throughout this season, Shae repeatedly protects Sansa\u2019s secrets despite the fact that these secrets are against the interests of her lover\u2019s family. Not only does she keep Sansa\u2019s secrets, she also tries to enlist Tyrion\u2019s help in protecting her.</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>We have to protect her.</i></p><p>Tyrion: <i>We can\u2019t. Now that the Lannisters have\ndiscarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old\nname.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere the conversation about protecting Sansa is derailed by Shae\u2019s jealousy.\nShe gets angry and jealous by Tyrion finding Sansa beautiful. <b>However, Shae\nNEVER blames Sansa for Tyrion finding her beautiful, as so many stories are wont to do. Shae blames Tyrion\nfor finding Sansa attractive.</b></p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>You pervert. You want her? This child?</i></p></blockquote><p>Shae\u2019s\njealousy is rooted in her insecurity, knowing that she can never marry Tyrion.\nBut she also seems angry and disappointed that Tyrion may be attracted to a girl as\nyoung as Sansa.</p><p>This fight between Shae and Tyrion also serves to highlight the theme that comes to dominate Sansa\u2019s narrative arc in the third season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>: Marriage. With the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, Sansa is now effectively Robb Stark\u2019s heir - and that makes her an attractive prospect for a political marriage since she is, as Robb\u2019s heir, the Key to the North.</p><p><br></p><p>To be continued\u2026</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p><p>(A special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pTAE90uTgRi8FbzkKnz0w\">@nothinghappensinalstonville</a> for making a pair of GIFs for me)</p></p>",

Thankfully, season 3 dials back on the abuse and in this context, it is worth noting that Sansa is repeatedly confronted with people who, with varying degrees of honesty, either promise help her escape her abusive situation or protect her from the abuse.\u00a0If Sansa\u2019s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.</p><p>Season 3 is the season where Petyr Baelish enters Sansa\u2019s narrative in a serious and important way. He has previously interacted with her very briefly in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">season 1</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">season 2</a> - but until now she hasn\u2019t been the focus of his intrigues.

Sansa is inventing stories for the various\nships they see but Shae doesn\u2019t really understand the purpose of this game when Sansa invites her\nto join in \u2013 why make up stories about these ships when the truth is different?\nTo which Sansa replies:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09dc83bae883cdc4788a9cbb9a3fae9d/tumblr_inline_pcuookI9Sx1uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"></figure><p>What I find\nparticularly interesting about this particular exchange is that it highlights that <b>Sansa hasn\u2019t lost her love of storytelling.\nHowever, her perception of stories (and songs) have changed.</b> Whereas the\nna\u00efve and idealistic Sansa of season 1 thought that stories and songs\ncontained the truth, the more disillusioned Sansa of season 3 sees storytelling\nas an escape from a reality that is either boring or terrible. That is very\nunderstandable since Sansa\u2019s life has been rather terrible since her father was\nkilled.<br></p><p>Petyr\nBaelish approaches Sansa and Shae. He wants to speak with Sansa alone and when they are (somewhat) alone he reveals something important to her.</p><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>I saw your mother not long ago. She\u2019s very\neager to see you. And your sister.</i></p><p>Sansa\n(gasps): <i>Arya\u2019s alive? \u2026 You said you\nwould take me home.</i></p><p>Baelish: <i>You said King\u2019s Landing was your home.</i></p></blockquote><p>This last\nexchange is a call back to a conversation they had in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">last episode</a> of\nseason 2, after Joffrey had set Sansa aside as his betrothed. At that time\nSansa refused Baelish\u2019s offer, probably because she didn\u2019t trust him. Now,\nhowever, Baelish has found the thing that Sansa wants more than her home: her\nfamily! When he first extended his offer last season, he didn\u2019t mention that he\nhad met with Catelyn Stark, probably because he thought that the idea of home\nwas enough to get Sansa to agree to his proposal. She didn\u2019t. <b>Now, however, he skillfully dangles the\nprospect of reuniting with her family \u2013 and that is a temptation that Sansa\ncannot resist.</b> That he literally makes her beg for him to take her home\nmust be very gratifying for Baelish, especially since she initially refused\nhim.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef2601ac15bfe513fe17491769403110/tumblr_inline_pcuoq5B73I1uklhai_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>You are the property of the Crown.

Whilst Sansa\u2019s and\nDaenerys\u2019 narrative arcs are completely separate from each other, this transition\nfrom a woman longing for freedom to a woman who has embarked on a journey to\ntake charge of her life and her ambitions forms a very poignant\njuxtaposition.</p><p><b>A WORRIED FRIEND</b></p><p>Sansa may have promised Baelish not to tell anyone about his plan to spirit her away from King\u2019s Landing, but in the very next episode a scene between her and Shae in her chambers reveals that Sansa has confided in her maid.\u00a0It isn\u2019t\nstated directly but it can be deduced from\nthe dialogue. <b>What I find interesting is that Sansa promised Baelish to not\ntell as soul but here we have her discussing his offer with her maid and friend \u2013 and it just\nshows how much she trusts Shae.</b></p><p>We enter the scene mid-conversation, with Sansa telling Shae that Baelish said he didn\u2019t want anything from her and that he\u2019s only offering to help her because he loved her mother.

Shae is so fiercely\nmaternal in this scene \u2013 it is clear that she has taken Ros\u2019 warning to heart. As a fan\nof Sansa\u2019s character it is rather nice to see that at least one person in King\u2019s Landing is concerned about\nher welfare. I\u2019ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">previously written</a> about the maternal subtext that informs the way the show has written the relationship between Sansa and Shae. The genuine friendship between these two women is one of the few instances where the show improves upon the books - because female friendship is a HUGE blind-spot in GRRM\u2019s writing, which lacks any kind of positive relationships between women. I love that, in the show, Shae genuinely loves Sansa and that she is fiercely protective of her, which is confirmed when she in episode 10 angrily tells Varys:</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>I love that girl. I would kill for her.</i></p></blockquote><p>In the books, Sansa has NO true allies in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0 But having a\nmeaningful friendship with Shae doesn\u2019t really alter Sansa\u2019s general isolation at the royal court because Shae is powerless \u2013 though she actually tries to take steps to protect Sansa from Baelish by taking her worries to her lover Tyrion.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c1f38c695ab8a6518e954175bc71dd7/tumblr_inline_phmk21rZQ21uklhai_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"306\" data-orig-height=\"200\"></figure><p><b>IT IS\nWORTH NOTING THAT SHAE DOES NOT REVEAL BAELISH\u2019S OFFER TO SPIRIT SANSA AWAY\nFROM THE CITY AND THE LANNISTERS!</b> Though Shae genuinely loves Tyrion, she doesn\u2019t trust him with this secret - and I cannot stress enough how important this detail is! Throughout this season, Shae repeatedly protects Sansa\u2019s secrets despite the fact that these secrets are against the interests of her lover\u2019s family. Not only does she keep Sansa\u2019s secrets, she also tries to enlist Tyrion\u2019s help in protecting her.</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>We have to protect her.</i></p><p>Tyrion: <i>We can\u2019t. Now that the Lannisters have\ndiscarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old\nname.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere the conversation about protecting Sansa is derailed by Shae\u2019s jealousy.\nShe gets angry and jealous by Tyrion finding Sansa beautiful. <b>However, Shae\nNEVER blames Sansa for Tyrion finding her beautiful, as so many stories are wont to do. Shae blames Tyrion\nfor finding Sansa attractive.</b></p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>You pervert. You want her? This child?</i></p></blockquote><p>Shae\u2019s\njealousy is rooted in her insecurity, knowing that she can never marry Tyrion.\nBut she also seems angry and disappointed that Tyrion may be attracted to a girl as\nyoung as Sansa.</p><p>This fight between Shae and Tyrion also serves to highlight the theme that comes to dominate Sansa\u2019s narrative arc in the third season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>: Marriage. With the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, Sansa is now effectively Robb Stark\u2019s heir - and that makes her an attractive prospect for a political marriage since she is, as Robb\u2019s heir, the Key to the North.</p><p><br></p><p>To be continued\u2026</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p><p>(A special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pTAE90uTgRi8FbzkKnz0w\">@nothinghappensinalstonville</a> for making a pair of GIFs for me)</p></p>",

Thankfully, season 3 dials back on the abuse and in this context, it is worth noting that Sansa is repeatedly confronted with people who, with varying degrees of honesty, either promise help her escape her abusive situation or protect her from the abuse.&nbsp;If Sansa&rsquo;s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.</p><p>Season 3 is the season where Petyr Baelish enters Sansa&rsquo;s narrative in a serious and important way. He has previously interacted with her very briefly in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">season 1</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">season 2</a> - but until now she hasn&rsquo;t been the focus of his intrigues. From season 3 to season 7, Sansa Stark is one of the most important linchpins of Baelish&rsquo;s political intrigues. His actions shapes her narrative to a very large extent.&nbsp;</p><p><b>AN OFFER OF ESCAPE</b></p><p>In her very first scene of season 3 we find Sansa at a pier in the King&rsquo;s Landing harbour with Shae. Sansa is inventing stories for the various\nships they see but Shae doesn&rsquo;t really understand the purpose of this game when Sansa invites her\nto join in &ndash; why make up stories about these ships when the truth is different?\nTo which Sansa replies:</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09dc83bae883cdc4788a9cbb9a3fae9d/tumblr_inline_pcuookI9Sx1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>What I find\nparticularly interesting about this particular exchange is that it highlights that <b>Sansa hasn&rsquo;t lost her love of storytelling.\nHowever, her perception of stories (and songs) have changed.</b> Whereas the\nna&iuml;ve and idealistic Sansa of season 1 thought that stories and songs\ncontained the truth, the more disillusioned Sansa of season 3 sees storytelling\nas an escape from a reality that is either boring or terrible. That is very\nunderstandable since Sansa&rsquo;s life has been rather terrible since her father was\nkilled.<br /></p><p>Petyr\nBaelish approaches Sansa and Shae. He wants to speak with Sansa alone and when they are (somewhat) alone he reveals something important to her.</p><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>I saw your mother not long ago. She&rsquo;s very\neager to see you. And your sister.</i></p><p>Sansa\n(gasps): <i>Arya&rsquo;s alive? &hellip; You said you\nwould take me home.</i></p><p>Baelish: <i>You said King&rsquo;s Landing was your home.</i></p></blockquote><p>This last\nexchange is a call back to a conversation they had in the <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">last episode</a> of\nseason 2, after Joffrey had set Sansa aside as his betrothed. At that time\nSansa refused Baelish&rsquo;s offer, probably because she didn&rsquo;t trust him. Now,\nhowever, Baelish has found the thing that Sansa wants more than her home: her\nfamily! When he first extended his offer last season, he didn&rsquo;t mention that he\nhad met with Catelyn Stark, probably because he thought that the idea of home\nwas enough to get Sansa to agree to his proposal. She didn&rsquo;t. <b>Now, however, he skillfully dangles the\nprospect of reuniting with her family &ndash; and that is a temptation that Sansa\ncannot resist.</b> That he literally makes her beg for him to take her home\nmust be very gratifying for Baelish, especially since she initially refused\nhim.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef2601ac15bfe513fe17491769403110/tumblr_inline_pcuoq5B73I1uklhai_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>You are the property of the Crown.

Now she sounds desperate.</p><blockquote><p>Sansa: <i>Because I&rsquo;m a terrible liar. You said so\nyourself. &hellip; Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere they once again enter <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">the dynamic</a> that season 1 established between them:\nBaelish is making Sansa keep secrets through the implied threat of bodily harm\n(though always from persons other than him). This is a dynamic that we&rsquo;ll see\nplay out again and again as Baelish draws Sansa into more and more dangerous\nsecrets and it offers him a way to control her and make her dependent on him.\nHe enjoys the power that Sansa&rsquo;s desperation gives him and now he gives a\nlittle performance of hesitance to make her even more desperate.<br /></p><blockquote><p>Baelish: <i>I&rsquo;m waiting for word on an assignment that\nwill take me far away from the capital.

In television and cinema, editing is an extremely important narrative device and it can carry a lot of meaning. Whilst Sansa&rsquo;s and\nDaenerys&rsquo; narrative arcs are completely separate from each other, this transition\nfrom a woman longing for freedom to a woman who has embarked on a journey to\ntake charge of her life and her ambitions forms a very poignant\njuxtaposition.</p><p><b>A WORRIED FRIEND</b></p><p>Sansa may have promised Baelish not to tell anyone about his plan to spirit her away from King&rsquo;s Landing, but in the very next episode a scene between her and Shae in her chambers reveals that Sansa has confided in her maid.&nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t\nstated directly but it can be deduced from\nthe dialogue. <b>What I find interesting is that Sansa promised Baelish to not\ntell as soul but here we have her discussing his offer with her maid and friend &ndash; and it just\nshows how much she trusts Shae.</b></p><p>We enter the scene mid-conversation, with Sansa telling Shae that Baelish said he didn&rsquo;t want anything from her and that he&rsquo;s only offering to help her because he loved her mother. Shae is, however, not quite convinced of the purity of Baelish&rsquo;s intentions, courtesy of Ros&rsquo; warning.</p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5605dbcb89bbe13409210c96128cf631/tumblr_inline_pcuovq6hHS1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Shae is\njustifiably skeptical &ndash; she rightly suspects Baelish of having an agenda with\nSansa, though she thinks that Baelish&rsquo;s interest in Sansa is primarily sexual\n(understandable considering her background). However, later episodes of this season make it\nclear that Baelish&rsquo;s interest in Sansa is primarily political though he\ntransfers his obsession with Catelyn Stark onto her daughter in season 4. Sansa, on the other hand, finds Shae&rsquo;s insinuation rather ridiculous.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/928a8ab7580b48218050889b3cff51b0/tumblr_inline_phquzhhjG01uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa is\nright, he&rsquo;s not in love with her. He wants to exploit her political status as\nRobb Stark&rsquo;s heir. With the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark,&nbsp;<b>Sansa has become the Robb&rsquo;s heir in the eyes of Westeros - she is, politically speaking, the Key to the North if Robb dies and it is this political status that shapes her\nnarrative arc in season 3.</b></p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>Love is not the thing he wants.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b5771372ab34cce86474de948640caa/tumblr_inline_phqv0nYQgS1uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I love Sansa&rsquo;s expression here! Petyr Baelish is about the same age as her mother and to the rather innocent Sansa it is inconceivable that a man of that age could have a sexual interest in a 14 year-old girl. Shae knows better.</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>They never see it that way. He didn&rsquo;t ask\nyou to do something for him? Spy on someone or&hellip;</i></p><p>Sansa: <i>No.</i></p></blockquote><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/433e08908c0a26ef473ca46ef42a5cda/tumblr_inline_phlif5GKF61uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><blockquote><p>Sansa\n(smiling): <i>Why? What would you do?</i></p><p>Shae: <i>I will make him stop.</i></p></blockquote><p>Sansa gives\na soft little smile here, which is wonderful to see. Shae is so fiercely\nmaternal in this scene &ndash; it is clear that she has taken Ros&rsquo; warning to heart. As a fan\nof Sansa&rsquo;s character it is rather nice to see that at least one person in King&rsquo;s Landing is concerned about\nher welfare. I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/175999573309/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-9\">previously written</a> about the maternal subtext that informs the way the show has written the relationship between Sansa and Shae. The genuine friendship between these two women is one of the few instances where the show improves upon the books - because female friendship is a HUGE blind-spot in GRRM&rsquo;s writing, which lacks any kind of positive relationships between women. I love that, in the show, Shae genuinely loves Sansa and that she is fiercely protective of her, which is confirmed when she in episode 10 angrily tells Varys:</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>I love that girl. I would kill for her.</i></p></blockquote><p>In the books, Sansa has NO true allies in King&rsquo;s Landing.&nbsp; But having a\nmeaningful friendship with Shae doesn&rsquo;t really alter Sansa&rsquo;s general isolation at the royal court because Shae is powerless &ndash; though she actually tries to take steps to protect Sansa from Baelish by taking her worries to her lover Tyrion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c1f38c695ab8a6518e954175bc71dd7/tumblr_inline_phmk21rZQ21uklhai_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>IT IS\nWORTH NOTING THAT SHAE DOES NOT REVEAL BAELISH&rsquo;S OFFER TO SPIRIT SANSA AWAY\nFROM THE CITY AND THE LANNISTERS!</b> Though Shae genuinely loves Tyrion, she doesn&rsquo;t trust him with this secret - and I cannot stress enough how important this detail is! Throughout this season, Shae repeatedly protects Sansa&rsquo;s secrets despite the fact that these secrets are against the interests of her lover&rsquo;s family. Not only does she keep Sansa&rsquo;s secrets, she also tries to enlist Tyrion&rsquo;s help in protecting her.</p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>We have to protect her.</i></p><p>Tyrion: <i>We can&rsquo;t. Now that the Lannisters have\ndiscarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old\nname.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is\nwhere the conversation about protecting Sansa is derailed by Shae&rsquo;s jealousy.\nShe gets angry and jealous by Tyrion finding Sansa beautiful. <b>However, Shae\nNEVER blames Sansa for Tyrion finding her beautiful, as so many stories are wont to do. Shae blames Tyrion\nfor finding Sansa attractive.</b></p><blockquote><p>Shae: <i>You pervert. You want her? This child?</i></p></blockquote><p>Shae&rsquo;s\njealousy is rooted in her insecurity, knowing that she can never marry Tyrion.\nBut she also seems angry and disappointed that Tyrion may be attracted to a girl as\nyoung as Sansa.</p><p>This fight between Shae and Tyrion also serves to highlight the theme that comes to dominate Sansa&rsquo;s narrative arc in the third season of <i>Game of Thrones</i>: Marriage. With the supposed deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark, Sansa is now effectively Robb Stark&rsquo;s heir - and that makes her an attractive prospect for a political marriage since she is, as Robb&rsquo;s heir, the Key to the North.</p><p><br /></p><p>To be continued&hellip;</p><p>(GIFs not mine)</p><p>(A special thanks to <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m1pTAE90uTgRi8FbzkKnz0w\">@nothinghappensinalstonville</a> for making a pair of GIFs for me)</p></p>",

Thankfully, season 3 dials back on the abuse and in this context, it is worth noting that Sansa is repeatedly confronted with people who, with varying degrees of honesty, either promise help her escape her abusive situation or protect her from the abuse.&nbsp;If Sansa&rsquo;s season 2 arc was about enduring abuse, then her season 3 arc is dealing with hope of an escape - a hope held out by different political players of varying trustworthiness.</p>\n<p>Season 3 is the season where Petyr Baelish enters Sansa&rsquo;s narrative in a serious and important way. He has previously interacted with her very briefly in <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/167071937839/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-4\">season 1</a> and <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/176205607679/winterfells-daughter-on-sansa-stark-part-10\">season 2</a> - but until now she hasn&rsquo;t been the focus of his intrigues. From season 3 to season 7, Sansa Stark is one of the most important linchpins of Baelish&rsquo;s political intrigues. His actions shapes her narrative to a very large extent.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
