This is the\nfirst time Ned meets her after he found out about Robert\u2019s bastards, and we know that the secret TRUTH OF WHO IS JOFFREY\u2019S REAL FATHER is hanging between them, her role as his antagonist sealed.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eea7354bd1aec8e50f26d7c205f783d1/tumblr_inline_pfoz5v4nDq1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>From now on\nevery decision Ned takes will be the wrong one: Cersei tells him <b>\u201cIN THE GAME OF THRONES YOU WIN OR YOU DIE. THERE&rsquo;S NO MIDDLE GROUND\u201d </b>but the MADNESS OF his MERCY gives her the upper hand to win; he refuses her advances and openly defies her, like a not POLITICALNED;\nhe doesn\u2019t listen to Renly who suggests the not honorable but efficient route and relies on Littlefinger, who he trusts; he doesn\u2019t trust Sansa enough to tell her the TRUTH; he doesn\u2019t at least PRETEND to bend the knee to Joffrey\nwhile he can, he waits till he\u2019s forced to, his fate already determined and a\npublic display required.</p><p>As you can see, Jon and Ned\u2019s paths are very similar, only their decisions are the opposite: while Ned plays Ned and loses, Jon politically watches, learns and\nacts\u2026 and wins a ticket back home!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4b2d3b0b1d72f906bf11e2d80bb8b8a/tumblr_inline_pfplrg6YND1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"225\"/></figure><p>So, what\nhappens on the boat? To be concise, Jon wakes up and says to Daenerys <b>&ldquo;I\u2019M SORRY, I\u2019M SO SORRY&rdquo;</b> and takes her hand,\nshe gives her word to help with the NK and he calls her \u201c<b>DANY\u201d</b> and then <b>\u201cMY QUEEN\u201d</b>. It could seem an intimate moment\nbetween two people destined to come together and save the world\u2026 but\nof course there\u2019s more, and the parallel we\u2019ve been introduced with should be\nenough to anticipate it:<br/></p><p>- \u201c<b>DANY\u201d</b>: this is not a term of\nendearment to her, so much so that she remembers that it was her not so loving\nbrother who called her that, adding: <b>&ldquo;NOT\nTHE COMPANY YOU WANT TO KEEP&rdquo;</b>. This is a warning for us;</p><p>-\u201c<b>MY QUEEN\u201d</b>: Let\u2019s not overlook the\nobvious, he doesn\u2019t really call her that, he only asks\u00a0<b>\u201cHOW ABOUT MY QUEEN?\u201d</b>\u00a0It\u2019s not the same. This is no pledge whatsoever;</p><p>- \n\n<b>&ldquo;I&rsquo;D BEND THE KNEE BUT &hellip;&rdquo;</b>:\u00a0to follow\nup on the previous point, Jon does not actually bend the knee! By now \u201c<b>EVERYTHING BEFORE THE WORD\nBUT IS HORSESHIT</b>\u201d has become such a mantra that we all understand how\nimportant that BUT is, and we can\u2019t ignore either that his knee doesn\u2019t bend especially after the numerous times we\u2019ve been shown what a solemn moment that is, this season too\nwith Sansa and Jon miniatures;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/65532498932432447b6acd979f8b1212/tumblr_inline_pfp18oVxGX1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>- <b>\u201cWE\u2019RE GOING TO DESTROY THE KNIGHT KING AND\nHIS ARMY, WE\u2019LL DO IT TOGETHER</b>\u201d: because she has already promised her help,\nsome of you say this is the biggest clue that Jon is not lying, that he doesn&rsquo;t need to. But is it so? He\nsaw how much she wants the IT, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a possibility she said that\njust because she\u2019s hurting for her loss? Jon said to Sansa <b>\u201cIF YOU HAD SEEN THE NK YOU\u2019D THINK OF LITTLE ELSE</b>\u201d, Dany says <b>\u201cYOU HAVE TOO SEE IT TO KNOW\u201d</b>. So now she knows the danger. But if she\ndoes intend to go help the North why are they sailing to KL? It necessarily\nmeans that her help is still conditional on the ceasefire, right? So, let\u2019s say that\nCersei in the Pit refuses, what would happen next? Actually I think Jon has really\nno hope for the truce, how could he when Sansa talked to him about Cersei and he\u2019s already\nobserved Dany\u2019s pride and volatility? It\u2019s true, in\nthis precise moment she isn\u2019t asking him to bend the knee, but is she done\nexpecting it? There are too many incognita to be sure of anything, so it makes\nsense that Jon decides to go with the clever plan: if he pretends only to\nbend the knee, with no witness, without actually swearing an oath, without physically bending, when she\u2019s not asking, while she is emotionally distressed and he&rsquo;s stuck in bed, doesn\u2019t he\nhave a better chance to pull it off? If she believes he\u2019s surrendered the\nNorth to her, which she\u2019s being demanding forever,\nplus her feelings for him which he\u2019s aware of by now, doesn\u2019t he have more chances\nto keep her invested even if they will be \u201cfucked\u201d in the Pit? Maybe prevent her from DRACARYS OMNIA too? And look how\ntouched she is. I\u2019d say he nailed it one episode early\u2026;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"226\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ccad40e41e0df76efc316b8f8baaef8/tumblr_inline_pfn576n9fD1vseiju_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"226\"/></figure><p>-\u201c<b>AND THOSE WHO SWORE ALLEGIANCE TO YOU?\u201d</b>:\nand we\u2019re immediately reminded that there should be a swearing. But nobody SWORE\nhere! And to twist the knife further, this happens only few minutes after Brienne says\nto Sansa \u201c<b>I SWORE AN\u00a0</b><b>OATH TO\nPROTECT YOU AND YOUR SISTER</b>\u201d. Still, no swearing on the boat\u2026 at least not an oath;</p><p>- <b>\u201cYOU DO\u201d</b>: both\nthe actor and the director seem to point out that Jon is lying, not only because this moment is\na nice remainder of <a href=\"https://jonlovessansa.tumblr.com/post/172113124972/how-about-my-queen-id-bend-the-knee-but-what\"><i>Bran in the pilot</i></a>, but because in cinematography\nthis is how you film someone who has something to hide or who\u2019s lying;</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/095f4f477ce24c0ed61c5d19e6a9cdb9/tumblr_p4wexlJcWJ1wjfnc9o3_r2_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p> - <b>\u201cTHEY\u2019LL\nCOME TO SEE YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE\u201d</b>: it becomes almost ominous with the song\n\u201cWHAT YOU ARE\u201d as background music, and you find yourself wondering WHAT she is;</p><p>- <b>THE HAND HOLDING:</b> As much\nas it\u2019s true that Jon is the first to take her hand, the point is not what he does (though it\u2019s worth noting that when Sansa did this he couldn\u2019t say no to her) but what she does, which is to let go of his hand only to take it back later. In storytelling this is a way to show a TRUST SHIFT: when she\nfirst takes her hand away it means she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable, she still doesn\u2019t\ntrust him completely and wants to keep control. Remember that in the show, even more in\nthe books, she\u2019s been warned more than once not to trust people, <b>\u201cBECAUSE DRAGONS ARE FIRE MADE FLESH AND\nFIRE IS POWER\u201d</b>.

But is it so? He\nsaw how much she wants the IT, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a possibility she said that\njust because she\u2019s hurting for her loss? Jon said to Sansa <b>\u201cIF YOU HAD SEEN THE NK YOU\u2019D THINK OF LITTLE ELSE</b>\u201d, Dany says <b>\u201cYOU HAVE TOO SEE IT TO KNOW\u201d</b>. So now she knows the danger. But if she\ndoes intend to go help the North why are they sailing to KL? It necessarily\nmeans that her help is still conditional on the ceasefire, right? So, let\u2019s say that\nCersei in the Pit refuses, what would happen next? Actually I think Jon has really\nno hope for the truce, how could he when Sansa talked to him about Cersei and he\u2019s already\nobserved Dany\u2019s pride and volatility? It\u2019s true, in\nthis precise moment she isn\u2019t asking him to bend the knee, but is she done\nexpecting it? There are too many incognita to be sure of anything, so it makes\nsense that Jon decides to go with the clever plan: if he pretends only to\nbend the knee, with no witness, without actually swearing an oath, without physically bending, when she\u2019s not asking, while she is emotionally distressed and he\u2019s stuck in bed, doesn\u2019t he\nhave a better chance to pull it off? If she believes he\u2019s surrendered the\nNorth to her, which she\u2019s being demanding forever,\nplus her feelings for him which he\u2019s aware of by now, doesn\u2019t he have more chances\nto keep her invested even if they will be \u201cfucked\u201d in the Pit? Maybe prevent her from DRACARYS OMNIA too? And look how\ntouched she is.
