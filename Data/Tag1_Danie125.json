        "question": "I've said the same thing over at phandramacommentator, but wanted your thoughts as well. It baffles me that anyone can believe, one way or another, that D/P have confirmed their homo/bisexuality. If we're going off statements about sexual orientation coming from the guys themselves, then Dan is attracted to the biological female parts and Phil's ambiguous. Sexual/romantic attraction statements are a different, yet there are ppl who think the guys have \"confirmed\" their sexuality. Like, what??",
        "answer": "<p>I\u2019m going to start off by saying that I don\u2019t know enough about Phil and things he has said in the past to be able to speak to what he has confirmed or not, so I\u2019m just going to answer regarding Dan. The only place I have ever seen Dan specifically label himself was on Formspring, when he said he was bisexual, so that is something a lot of people take as gospel. However, he also said that his answers on that website were \u201cfull of lies\u201d and that he was prone to \u201clying and attention seeking\u201d and wasn\u2019t the best example. He even went as far as saying the things he said on those old websites don\u2019t prove anything and people taking them out of context keeps him up at night on his old tumblr blog. People sometimes dismiss these things because they were said back in 2012, but the original comments were from 2009 or 2010, so if Dan in 2012, said not to take things he said three years prior as fact, there is no reason not to respect him and his wishes and do that. At that point, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you think he is lying or telling the truth, you are making a conscious choice to either respect Dan or not by choosing to follow his wishes or not. It\u2019s as simple as that. If you don\u2019t, you are making a conscious choice to do something he has said bothers him and spread rumors about him. </p><p>We know that Dan has said multiple times that he is not gay and that he has only ever told us about him dating women in the past, but none of that is him defining his sexuality explicitly and I personally do not feel I have the right to assume his sexuality. People do assume his sexuality all the time for what seem like a variety of reasons, but ultimately all boil down to them wanting Dan to be something that fulfills some need that they have. None of it is about Dan himself and wanting him to be happy and that is unequivocally morally wrong, in my opinion. Anyone who just wants Dan to be comfortable and happy should just let him live his life and identify how he wants to the people that matter to him. Unless anyone out there is sleeping with him, they really don\u2019t have any right to know anything about his sex life or sexuality. It just isn\u2019t relevant. </p><p>Language is deeply important to us as human beings. The language we use is the way we understand the world around us and how we relate to others. It gives us the power to define who we are in society. The things we say matter. This is why it\u2019s so important not to misgender people. When anyone assumes Dan\u2019s sexuality and presents their speculations and opinions as fact, especially when they make up reasons to disregard the things he has said in the past, they are taking Dan\u2019s ability to define who he is and express himself away from him. He is the only person who should have the right to do that and it is the height of entitlement and disrespect for anyone to think by taking it away from him, they aren\u2019t doing any harm and it\u2019s \u201cnot that deep,\u201d which is an excuse I see a lot. </p><p>If Dan never wants to talk about sexuality with the phandom, we should respect that, if we respect him. It\u2019s none of our business. We shouldn\u2019t try to push something on him or threaten him with attacks on his character. Anyone who doesn\u2019t see why it is important should consider this: How would you like it if people at your school or work all tried to assume your sexuality and force their own ideals on you? You probably wouldn\u2019t like it. You might think it\u2019s none of their business and that you wish they would recognize you for your work and personality rather than as a sex object. Why do people think Dan is any less effected by objectification than anyone else? Would you say it was alright for a woman to be sexually harassed by her boss because she doesn\u2019t say anything when he does it? What if she\u2019s afraid? Don\u2019t you think all the pressure you put on Dan over his sexuality makes him fearful of losing his livelihood, just the way it might make the woman being sexually harassed by her boss be fearful? Through his videos and social media, Dan is choosing to define himself as a person who is funny and intelligent and compassionate and we should respect him and hold up those things up as the things that define who he is and stop treating him as if those things, the things that are important for him to share with the world about himself, are less important because we are nosey or want to use him to fill some kind of void in our own lives. If you truly value him as a human, doing that should not be a problem and you should be happy to do it. </p>",
