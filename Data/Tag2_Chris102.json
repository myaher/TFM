No matter how good of a person you could be, no matter how hard you try and help other people a lot of times putting other needs up higher, you get hurt more then you deserve. All the bad people end up living on and having the best life while you are in so much pain.</p><!-- more --><p>\n\nIt was a sunny day and that meant you, Chris and your kids would be going out for a lovely family day. \n\n<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready mommy\u201d Rob yelled out running down the stairs. Your son ran down fully dressed, plus his inhaler, Frisbee and many other thing you hadn\u2019t noticed. He was the one in your family that worried about germs, animals and life in general. And you loved him for than even more.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great dear\u201d he ran up, gave you a kiss and looked over all the thing you were packing, to make user they were all up to code. For someone his age he was very much more mature then his age.\u00a0 You were worried he\u2019d be called a names in school because of his maturity , then again you knew he was going to do amazing things for the world and lucky for you and everyone Chris knew the\u00a0 same thing. He was the one to say it the day Rob was born, and he had still says it years later.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Okay, I see the most amazing wife here and just one amazing kid, where is the other amazing one\u201d Chris said entering the kitchen. You smiled at him while packing the lunch. Chris picked up Rob while tickling him,\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s your sister. Tell me, tell me now\u201d you smiled looking at them both and smiled even more when Rebecca ran into the room laughing and yelling she was there. You watched your sweet family and couldn\u2019t how lucky you had gotten in life.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s ready for an amazing day?\u201d Chris yelled our putting down your kids and going up to you and giving you a kiss.\u00a0\u201clove you\u201d he whispered it to you. Chris had been doing that everyday for the past 10 years a small whisper just for you and only for you to hear it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You all got your thing together and went out. It was time to have the most amazing family day ever. There were so many plans for you all and a lot if it included playing games, taking photos, eating and just relaxing. When you and Chris found out you were pregnant a lot of things changed. One of them was Chris took time off worked. He started to work on tv-shows and small movies, he had always wanted to be on a tv-show and finally he could do that.\u00a0 When the kids came things changed even more, not only did Chris\u00a0 and you change work schedule, but also you both changed as people and you felt even better about yourself and life. It seemed you both had became even more happier then before.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Having the family together was always important to you and Chris. For you and Chris it was important to have family time. You had family time at the same time, but always did something you. There were times family time had to be changed a bit if someone was sick, or Chris wasn\u2019t able to come home as fast as he would want. As much as you tried to imagine your life being still that amazing it wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0</p><p>In reality you had spent the last few weeks in the hospitalize. You\u2019re last actual family times got ruined when you fell down at the park and ended up finding out you had cancer and there was nothing to do about it. Some how no one hadn\u2019t found out you had cancer even with all your check ups you had been doing. It was something you did once in a while after having kids. You wanted to be there for them, to be with Chris and see your kids grow up.\u00a0When you fell to the ground everything fell with you. Not only did your life fall but everyones too. People tried to fake their smiles, laughs, they tried to look away from all the machines keeping you alive, they tried to look away from how you were getting weaker day by day. No matter how hard they tried to keep their spirits up you could see through them but you said nothing. You already felt horrible by being in the situation you were in, more because you felt bad seeing how hard it was on them, you felt like a burden on them, it made you want it all to end sooner, but at the same time you didn\u2019t want to leave your family, your loved ones.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d your doctor said walking in with your papers,</p><p>\u201cOh great, ran a marathon this morning, went to the gym afterwards thought the marathon wasn\u2019t enough\u201d your doctor loved your sense of humor. Even though you both knew that you hadn\u2019t been out of the bed without help in months, almost a year. He laughed and then gave you the same look he and everyone else give you. The look of pity and sadness, the looked you hated so damn much. Your doctor ,Mike, had became family. He knew all your family members by name and even knew what they liked and didn\u2019t like in drink and foods. Mike would bring food to your family if they stayed longer at the hospital then the cafeteria worked but also he knew the food wasn\u2019t the best.</p><p>\u201cAnd in reality?\u201d he wasn\u2019t letting gown. Mike knew you hated talking about yourself and most of the time you played down your pain and sadness so much, but with time he had learned what you really meant when saying things.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, a little tired, but fine.\u201d you said and as always didn\u2019t tell the full truth. In reality he didn\u2019t need you to say how it really was, all the nurses and doctors that had worked at the night shift already told him all the time you had vomited, had panic attacks and woken up in pain. Mike understood you not wanting to talk about all the horrible things that had happened to you at night, knowing you were already in pain and very tired of everything.\u00a0<br/></p><p>You and Mike talked a bit, he left right before Chris and your kids walked in your hospital room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy, mommy\u201d Rebecca and Rob yelled running in the room and jumping on the bed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBe careful\u201d Chris yelled out when they landed on the bad and seeing your pain filled face. You were in pain but you also were happy to see all of them. You missed them all the time. You missed telling bedtime stories to Rebecca. All those princess stories she loved and Rob acted he hated, while in reality he was standing behind the door listening to them. You missed Rob telling you the new things he found out about the world, all the medicine and new electronics created. You could already tell he was going to do some amazing things in life, you just wished you could be there to witness all of it.\u00a0<br/></p><p>As usually Chris and the kids told all the things you had misses. Things that had happened in school and kindergarten. Like Rob had made a new friend that was fascinated with the same things as him and they were having a play-date, something that you wished you could attend too.\u00a0 Rebecca told you about all the things she had learned. She had learned how to write new letters and read knew words. With every story your beloved kids were telling you felt more and more pain. There were tears you were holding back, but it was getting hard to do that, since you really didn\u2019t have that much energy. Chris saw what was happening and asked nurse Jackie to look after them. They loved nurse Jackie and you loved her too, she had been best friend in the hospital. She helping you deal with everything, the pain, the panics you had in you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you sweetheart?\u201d Chris asked coming closer to you and taking your hand in his. Chris gave your hand 3\u00a0squeezes, that was a secret signal between you and him. It had been something you did too each other from the moment the two of you started dating but didn\u2019t want everyone to know it. It was your sweet way to tell each other you loved that other person. You wanted to tell him you were fine, but you also knew it was a lie and Chris would be able to tell it was a lie. You were in pain, and looking in his eyes you felt more pain not because he\u2019d be giving you the pain. You felt pain because you knew you\u2019d have to leave him soon. Him and your amazing children. Children you had always wanted but now had to leave without a mother. Chris saw your tears and didn\u2019t say anything anymore, he just climbed in bed with you and hugged you. As you breathed in his sent that you missed every night when you were trying to fall asleep. Not having Chris by your side at night made it so much harder to fall asleep. Just when you thought you\u2019d be falling asleep in your husbands arms Mike walked in.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itCItPwyyYE&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLfoszboxNI5M21xPEUr7aW03LcPcdleAS&amp;index=4\">(Listen while reading)</a></p><p>\u201cOh sorry\u201d Mike stopped but didn\u2019t leave.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d you looked at him and knew he wasn\u2019t apologizing for walking. He was saying sorry for something more important. You could feel Chris start to worry, his heart was beating much faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d those two words had so many meaning that Mike understood. You saw it in his eyes. You saw the pain, the sadness. He hate. Mike had always did his best to help you. He had always been there for you and your family. He put all his time in to helping you.\u00a0 Every time you felt sick he was angry with himself, because he was supposed to be your doctor, he thought he was supposed to make you feel better but no matter what he did you still felt horrible. You still vomited at night, you still yelled out in pain. There were times Mike was till at the hospital and could actually hear you yell out. There was so much pain in you but somehow when ever he came in your room you acted as if everything was fine. IT made him fight for you more and more. But no matter how much he tried, no matter how much he prayed with your family to save you none of it worked and there he stood. About to tell the most horrible news and he couldn\u2019t do it. Mike looked at you and Chris, laying in each others eyes and he just couldn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t need him to say it, you already knew it in your heart. You didn\u2019t have much time.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d you said again as Mike fell down in a chair. Chris started to panic<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Mike what\u2019s going on?\u201d he ran up to him but Mike couldn\u2019t speak. For the first time in his carrier, he had fallen apart. He didn\u2019t want to lose you. Not because he didn\u2019t want to lose a patient, Mike didn\u2019t want to lose his friend. He as in pain just like everyone else. Everyone else in your family and in the hospital. While being there you had became friends with everyone. You were always nice to everyone. You talked to everyone, remembered everyone and their kids. There wasn\u2019t a day you hadn\u2019t made a staff worker smile. Mike was crying in his hands, Chris was panicking but you were looking back at all your memories and all the things you wanted to do in life but most of all there were things you wanted to say to the people around you.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cChris\u201d you said in a very weak voice.\u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u201d you said that because you believed it. You believed that Chris, your kids and the rest of your family would be fine.\u00a0 Chris started to argue and even yell a bit, but soon stopped seeing the look in your eyes. He stopped talking, climbed back in bed with you, wrapped you in his arms and just listened to what you had to say. Mike stayed for a bit but but then left. He went to his office, locked his door and cried his pain out.\u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d you started off\u00a0\u201cI love you and our kids I love you for being there for me and them. I thank you for being there for me no matter what. When ever I felt bad you were always there to make me feel good about myself. I love you Chris. I\u2019m sorry you had to see me like this. And I know you\u2019ll hate what I\u2019m about to say, but\u201d you leaned back and looked in his eyes\u00a0\u201cI want you to be happy. So if you meet someone\u201d he was about to protest but stopped himself\u00a0\u201cand if you fall for that person, don\u2019t make me the person to stop you from love. Don\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t want that. I want you to be happy. Chris you deserve love and passion and just because I\u2019m not going to be there anymore doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop yourself from loving another person. I want and need you to be happy. I need you to not give up. Do not give up for our kids. They will need you. They need you.\u201d you cupped his cheek for the last time and Chris leaned in your touch. He didn\u2019t want to hear you say all thous things only because it mean you were actually leaving. You were actually leaving his touch, his life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d Chris whispered bearing his head in your neck. The two of you were in each others arms, crying and saying how much you loved each other. But you were\u2019t the only ones crying. Behind the closed door, in the hall way every other nurse was in tears, every person you had came in touch while being there, were in tears. The news about you not being able to be saved went like wildfire and everyone were heart broken.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not right\u201d said one nurse to another. As she walked to your room to give your daily medicine. She held the try close to her, stopping it from shaking. She was filled with sadness but didn\u2019t want you to see it. Just as she turns in your room, the whole hospital is filled with hear pain filled yells, instead of her usual hello greetings to you. The tray dropped to the floor adding more horrifying sounds and she falls with it. Every nurse including doctor Mike run to the room just to stop and fell the same pain and feeling of yelling to into the world. They all stop to the sight of your crying husband holding you in his arms and sound of your heart monitor being dead silent. Your beautiful beating heart had stopped and the world stopped with it. You were gone, you weren\u2019t there anymore. There were no more smiles, no more laughter in that room. Suddenly the room had gone cold, so cold you could even see your own breath. No one said anything, there was nothing to say. Nothing that could make this horrible moment better. Nothing at all. What could you possibly say in a moment like this. There wasn\u2019t a person in the whole building that didn\u2019t feel as if something had gone the complete wrong way.\u00a0People tried to think that you were in a better place and that now you weren\u2019t in pain but that just made them hurt even more all that\u00a0 just meant you weren\u2019t there anymore an you\u2019d never be there ever again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy\u201d a faint, pain filled whisper came from a child, breaking everyones hearts even more. Young Rebecca climbed in her mothers bed and shook her.\u00a0\u201cMommy wake up\u201d she said in a panic.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cBecca\u201d Chris tried to pulled hu daughter way but there was no use.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cMOMMY\u201d she yelled. She knew her mom was gone but yet she couldn\u2019t accept it. It was her mommy, her hero and she just couldn\u2019t believe that her hero was gone.\u00a0<br/></p><p>There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the whole hallway. That day wasn\u2019t just a sorrow day for your family. It was a sorrow day for every single person that had ever met you, every person that had the pleasure of seeing your smile and feel your energy. Just few days after that horrible day the hospital put up a photo of you in memory of you and your energy. It said:\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>In memory of our beloved friend. We miss you every day, but we are still inspired by you.\u201d</i></p>",

No matter how good of a person you could be, no matter how hard you try and help other people a lot of times putting other needs up higher, you get hurt more then you deserve. All the bad people end up living on and having the best life while you are in so much pain.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\nIt was a sunny day and that meant you, Chris and your kids would be going out for a lovely family day. \n\n<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready mommy\u201d Rob yelled out running down the stairs. Your son ran down fully dressed, plus his inhaler, Frisbee and many other thing you hadn\u2019t noticed. He was the one in your family that worried about germs, animals and life in general. And you loved him for than even more.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great dear\u201d he ran up, gave you a kiss and looked over all the thing you were packing, to make user they were all up to code. For someone his age he was very much more mature then his age.\u00a0 You were worried he\u2019d be called a names in school because of his maturity , then again you knew he was going to do amazing things for the world and lucky for you and everyone Chris knew the\u00a0 same thing. He was the one to say it the day Rob was born, and he had still says it years later.\u00a0</p><p>\u2018Okay, I see the most amazing wife here and just one amazing kid, where is the other amazing one\u201d Chris said entering the kitchen. You smiled at him while packing the lunch. Chris picked up Rob while tickling him,\u00a0\u201cWhere\u2019s your sister. Tell me, tell me now\u201d you smiled looking at them both and smiled even more when Rebecca ran into the room laughing and yelling she was there. You watched your sweet family and couldn\u2019t how lucky you had gotten in life.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s ready for an amazing day?\u201d Chris yelled our putting down your kids and going up to you and giving you a kiss.\u00a0\u201clove you\u201d he whispered it to you. Chris had been doing that everyday for the past 10 years a small whisper just for you and only for you to hear it.\u00a0<br></p><p>You all got your thing together and went out. It was time to have the most amazing family day ever. There were so many plans for you all and a lot if it included playing games, taking photos, eating and just relaxing. When you and Chris found out you were pregnant a lot of things changed. One of them was Chris took time off worked. He started to work on tv-shows and small movies, he had always wanted to be on a tv-show and finally he could do that.\u00a0 When the kids came things changed even more, not only did Chris\u00a0 and you change work schedule, but also you both changed as people and you felt even better about yourself and life. It seemed you both had became even more happier then before.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Having the family together was always important to you and Chris. For you and Chris it was important to have family time. You had family time at the same time, but always did something you. There were times family time had to be changed a bit if someone was sick, or Chris wasn\u2019t able to come home as fast as he would want. As much as you tried to imagine your life being still that amazing it wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0</p><p>In reality you had spent the last few weeks in the hospitalize. You\u2019re last actual family times got ruined when you fell down at the park and ended up finding out you had cancer and there was nothing to do about it. Some how no one hadn\u2019t found out you had cancer even with all your check ups you had been doing. It was something you did once in a while after having kids. You wanted to be there for them, to be with Chris and see your kids grow up.\u00a0When you fell to the ground everything fell with you. Not only did your life fall but everyones too. People tried to fake their smiles, laughs, they tried to look away from all the machines keeping you alive, they tried to look away from how you were getting weaker day by day. No matter how hard they tried to keep their spirits up you could see through them but you said nothing. You already felt horrible by being in the situation you were in, more because you felt bad seeing how hard it was on them, you felt like a burden on them, it made you want it all to end sooner, but at the same time you didn\u2019t want to leave your family, your loved ones.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d your doctor said walking in with your papers,</p><p>\u201cOh great, ran a marathon this morning, went to the gym afterwards thought the marathon wasn\u2019t enough\u201d your doctor loved your sense of humor. Even though you both knew that you hadn\u2019t been out of the bed without help in months, almost a year. He laughed and then gave you the same look he and everyone else give you. The look of pity and sadness, the looked you hated so damn much. Your doctor ,Mike, had became family. He knew all your family members by name and even knew what they liked and didn\u2019t like in drink and foods. Mike would bring food to your family if they stayed longer at the hospital then the cafeteria worked but also he knew the food wasn\u2019t the best.</p><p>\u201cAnd in reality?\u201d he wasn\u2019t letting gown. Mike knew you hated talking about yourself and most of the time you played down your pain and sadness so much, but with time he had learned what you really meant when saying things.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, a little tired, but fine.\u201d you said and as always didn\u2019t tell the full truth. In reality he didn\u2019t need you to say how it really was, all the nurses and doctors that had worked at the night shift already told him all the time you had vomited, had panic attacks and woken up in pain. Mike understood you not wanting to talk about all the horrible things that had happened to you at night, knowing you were already in pain and very tired of everything.\u00a0<br></p><p>You and Mike talked a bit, he left right before Chris and your kids walked in your hospital room.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy, mommy\u201d Rebecca and Rob yelled running in the room and jumping on the bed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBe careful\u201d Chris yelled out when they landed on the bad and seeing your pain filled face. You were in pain but you also were happy to see all of them. You missed them all the time. You missed telling bedtime stories to Rebecca. All those princess stories she loved and Rob acted he hated, while in reality he was standing behind the door listening to them. You missed Rob telling you the new things he found out about the world, all the medicine and new electronics created. You could already tell he was going to do some amazing things in life, you just wished you could be there to witness all of it.\u00a0<br></p><p>As usually Chris and the kids told all the things you had misses. Things that had happened in school and kindergarten. Like Rob had made a new friend that was fascinated with the same things as him and they were having a play-date, something that you wished you could attend too.\u00a0 Rebecca told you about all the things she had learned. She had learned how to write new letters and read knew words. With every story your beloved kids were telling you felt more and more pain. There were tears you were holding back, but it was getting hard to do that, since you really didn\u2019t have that much energy. Chris saw what was happening and asked nurse Jackie to look after them. They loved nurse Jackie and you loved her too, she had been best friend in the hospital. She helping you deal with everything, the pain, the panics you had in you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you sweetheart?\u201d Chris asked coming closer to you and taking your hand in his. Chris gave your hand 3\u00a0squeezes, that was a secret signal between you and him. It had been something you did too each other from the moment the two of you started dating but didn\u2019t want everyone to know it. It was your sweet way to tell each other you loved that other person. You wanted to tell him you were fine, but you also knew it was a lie and Chris would be able to tell it was a lie. You were in pain, and looking in his eyes you felt more pain not because he\u2019d be giving you the pain. You felt pain because you knew you\u2019d have to leave him soon. Him and your amazing children. Children you had always wanted but now had to leave without a mother. Chris saw your tears and didn\u2019t say anything anymore, he just climbed in bed with you and hugged you. As you breathed in his sent that you missed every night when you were trying to fall asleep. Not having Chris by your side at night made it so much harder to fall asleep. Just when you thought you\u2019d be falling asleep in your husbands arms Mike walked in.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itCItPwyyYE&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLfoszboxNI5M21xPEUr7aW03LcPcdleAS&amp;index=4\">(Listen while reading)</a></p><p>\u201cOh sorry\u201d Mike stopped but didn\u2019t leave.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d you looked at him and knew he wasn\u2019t apologizing for walking. He was saying sorry for something more important. You could feel Chris start to worry, his heart was beating much faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d those two words had so many meaning that Mike understood. You saw it in his eyes. You saw the pain, the sadness. He hate. Mike had always did his best to help you. He had always been there for you and your family. He put all his time in to helping you.\u00a0 Every time you felt sick he was angry with himself, because he was supposed to be your doctor, he thought he was supposed to make you feel better but no matter what he did you still felt horrible. You still vomited at night, you still yelled out in pain. There were times Mike was till at the hospital and could actually hear you yell out. There was so much pain in you but somehow when ever he came in your room you acted as if everything was fine. IT made him fight for you more and more. But no matter how much he tried, no matter how much he prayed with your family to save you none of it worked and there he stood. About to tell the most horrible news and he couldn\u2019t do it. Mike looked at you and Chris, laying in each others eyes and he just couldn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t need him to say it, you already knew it in your heart. You didn\u2019t have much time.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d you said again as Mike fell down in a chair. Chris started to panic<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Mike what\u2019s going on?\u201d he ran up to him but Mike couldn\u2019t speak. For the first time in his carrier, he had fallen apart. He didn\u2019t want to lose you. Not because he didn\u2019t want to lose a patient, Mike didn\u2019t want to lose his friend. He as in pain just like everyone else. Everyone else in your family and in the hospital. While being there you had became friends with everyone. You were always nice to everyone. You talked to everyone, remembered everyone and their kids. There wasn\u2019t a day you hadn\u2019t made a staff worker smile. Mike was crying in his hands, Chris was panicking but you were looking back at all your memories and all the things you wanted to do in life but most of all there were things you wanted to say to the people around you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cChris\u201d you said in a very weak voice.\u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u201d you said that because you believed it. You believed that Chris, your kids and the rest of your family would be fine.\u00a0 Chris started to argue and even yell a bit, but soon stopped seeing the look in your eyes. He stopped talking, climbed back in bed with you, wrapped you in his arms and just listened to what you had to say. Mike stayed for a bit but but then left. He went to his office, locked his door and cried his pain out.\u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d you started off\u00a0\u201cI love you and our kids I love you for being there for me and them. I thank you for being there for me no matter what. When ever I felt bad you were always there to make me feel good about myself. I love you Chris. I\u2019m sorry you had to see me like this. And I know you\u2019ll hate what I\u2019m about to say, but\u201d you leaned back and looked in his eyes\u00a0\u201cI want you to be happy. So if you meet someone\u201d he was about to protest but stopped himself\u00a0\u201cand if you fall for that person, don\u2019t make me the person to stop you from love. Don\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t want that. I want you to be happy. Chris you deserve love and passion and just because I\u2019m not going to be there anymore doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop yourself from loving another person. I want and need you to be happy. I need you to not give up. Do not give up for our kids. They will need you. They need you.\u201d you cupped his cheek for the last time and Chris leaned in your touch. He didn\u2019t want to hear you say all thous things only because it mean you were actually leaving. You were actually leaving his touch, his life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d Chris whispered bearing his head in your neck. The two of you were in each others arms, crying and saying how much you loved each other. But you were\u2019t the only ones crying. Behind the closed door, in the hall way every other nurse was in tears, every person you had came in touch while being there, were in tears. The news about you not being able to be saved went like wildfire and everyone were heart broken.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not right\u201d said one nurse to another. As she walked to your room to give your daily medicine. She held the try close to her, stopping it from shaking. She was filled with sadness but didn\u2019t want you to see it. Just as she turns in your room, the whole hospital is filled with hear pain filled yells, instead of her usual hello greetings to you. The tray dropped to the floor adding more horrifying sounds and she falls with it. Every nurse including doctor Mike run to the room just to stop and fell the same pain and feeling of yelling to into the world. They all stop to the sight of your crying husband holding you in his arms and sound of your heart monitor being dead silent. Your beautiful beating heart had stopped and the world stopped with it. You were gone, you weren\u2019t there anymore. There were no more smiles, no more laughter in that room. Suddenly the room had gone cold, so cold you could even see your own breath. No one said anything, there was nothing to say. Nothing that could make this horrible moment better. Nothing at all. What could you possibly say in a moment like this. There wasn\u2019t a person in the whole building that didn\u2019t feel as if something had gone the complete wrong way.\u00a0People tried to think that you were in a better place and that now you weren\u2019t in pain but that just made them hurt even more all that\u00a0 just meant you weren\u2019t there anymore an you\u2019d never be there ever again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy\u201d a faint, pain filled whisper came from a child, breaking everyones hearts even more. Young Rebecca climbed in her mothers bed and shook her.\u00a0\u201cMommy wake up\u201d she said in a panic.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecca\u201d Chris tried to pulled hu daughter way but there was no use.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMOMMY\u201d she yelled. She knew her mom was gone but yet she couldn\u2019t accept it. It was her mommy, her hero and she just couldn\u2019t believe that her hero was gone.\u00a0<br></p><p>There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the whole hallway. That day wasn\u2019t just a sorrow day for your family. It was a sorrow day for every single person that had ever met you, every person that had the pleasure of seeing your smile and feel your energy. Just few days after that horrible day the hospital put up a photo of you in memory of you and your energy. It said:\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>In memory of our beloved friend. We miss you every day, but we are still inspired by you.\u201d</i></p></p>",

She helping you deal with everything, the pain, the panics you had in you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHow are you sweetheart?\u201d Chris asked coming closer to you and taking your hand in his. Chris gave your hand 3\u00a0squeezes, that was a secret signal between you and him. It had been something you did too each other from the moment the two of you started dating but didn\u2019t want everyone to know it. It was your sweet way to tell each other you loved that other person. You wanted to tell him you were fine, but you also knew it was a lie and Chris would be able to tell it was a lie. You were in pain, and looking in his eyes you felt more pain not because he\u2019d be giving you the pain. You felt pain because you knew you\u2019d have to leave him soon. Him and your amazing children. Children you had always wanted but now had to leave without a mother. Chris saw your tears and didn\u2019t say anything anymore, he just climbed in bed with you and hugged you. As you breathed in his sent that you missed every night when you were trying to fall asleep. Not having Chris by your side at night made it so much harder to fall asleep. Just when you thought you\u2019d be falling asleep in your husbands arms Mike walked in.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itCItPwyyYE&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLfoszboxNI5M21xPEUr7aW03LcPcdleAS&amp;index=4\">(Listen while reading)</a></p><p>\u201cOh sorry\u201d Mike stopped but didn\u2019t leave.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u201d you looked at him and knew he wasn\u2019t apologizing for walking. He was saying sorry for something more important. You could feel Chris start to worry, his heart was beating much faster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d those two words had so many meaning that Mike understood. You saw it in his eyes. You saw the pain, the sadness. He hate. Mike had always did his best to help you. He had always been there for you and your family. He put all his time in to helping you.\u00a0 Every time you felt sick he was angry with himself, because he was supposed to be your doctor, he thought he was supposed to make you feel better but no matter what he did you still felt horrible. You still vomited at night, you still yelled out in pain. There were times Mike was till at the hospital and could actually hear you yell out. There was so much pain in you but somehow when ever he came in your room you acted as if everything was fine. IT made him fight for you more and more. But no matter how much he tried, no matter how much he prayed with your family to save you none of it worked and there he stood. About to tell the most horrible news and he couldn\u2019t do it. Mike looked at you and Chris, laying in each others eyes and he just couldn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t need him to say it, you already knew it in your heart. You didn\u2019t have much time.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u201d you said again as Mike fell down in a chair. Chris started to panic<br></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Mike what\u2019s going on?\u201d he ran up to him but Mike couldn\u2019t speak. For the first time in his carrier, he had fallen apart. He didn\u2019t want to lose you. Not because he didn\u2019t want to lose a patient, Mike didn\u2019t want to lose his friend. He as in pain just like everyone else. Everyone else in your family and in the hospital. While being there you had became friends with everyone. You were always nice to everyone. You talked to everyone, remembered everyone and their kids. There wasn\u2019t a day you hadn\u2019t made a staff worker smile. Mike was crying in his hands, Chris was panicking but you were looking back at all your memories and all the things you wanted to do in life but most of all there were things you wanted to say to the people around you.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cChris\u201d you said in a very weak voice.\u00a0\u201cEverything will be okay\u201d you said that because you believed it. You believed that Chris, your kids and the rest of your family would be fine.\u00a0 Chris started to argue and even yell a bit, but soon stopped seeing the look in your eyes. He stopped talking, climbed back in bed with you, wrapped you in his arms and just listened to what you had to say. Mike stayed for a bit but but then left. He went to his office, locked his door and cried his pain out.\u00a0\u201cI love you\u201d you started off\u00a0\u201cI love you and our kids I love you for being there for me and them. I thank you for being there for me no matter what. When ever I felt bad you were always there to make me feel good about myself. I love you Chris. I\u2019m sorry you had to see me like this. And I know you\u2019ll hate what I\u2019m about to say, but\u201d you leaned back and looked in his eyes\u00a0\u201cI want you to be happy. So if you meet someone\u201d he was about to protest but stopped himself\u00a0\u201cand if you fall for that person, don\u2019t make me the person to stop you from love. Don\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t want that. I want you to be happy. Chris you deserve love and passion and just because I\u2019m not going to be there anymore doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop yourself from loving another person. I want and need you to be happy. I need you to not give up. Do not give up for our kids. They will need you. They need you.\u201d you cupped his cheek for the last time and Chris leaned in your touch. He didn\u2019t want to hear you say all thous things only because it mean you were actually leaving. You were actually leaving his touch, his life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you\u201d Chris whispered bearing his head in your neck. The two of you were in each others arms, crying and saying how much you loved each other. But you were\u2019t the only ones crying. Behind the closed door, in the hall way every other nurse was in tears, every person you had came in touch while being there, were in tears. The news about you not being able to be saved went like wildfire and everyone were heart broken.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not right\u201d said one nurse to another. As she walked to your room to give your daily medicine. She held the try close to her, stopping it from shaking. She was filled with sadness but didn\u2019t want you to see it. Just as she turns in your room, the whole hospital is filled with hear pain filled yells, instead of her usual hello greetings to you. The tray dropped to the floor adding more horrifying sounds and she falls with it. Every nurse including doctor Mike run to the room just to stop and fell the same pain and feeling of yelling to into the world. They all stop to the sight of your crying husband holding you in his arms and sound of your heart monitor being dead silent. Your beautiful beating heart had stopped and the world stopped with it. You were gone, you weren\u2019t there anymore. There were no more smiles, no more laughter in that room. Suddenly the room had gone cold, so cold you could even see your own breath. No one said anything, there was nothing to say. Nothing that could make this horrible moment better. Nothing at all. What could you possibly say in a moment like this. There wasn\u2019t a person in the whole building that didn\u2019t feel as if something had gone the complete wrong way.\u00a0People tried to think that you were in a better place and that now you weren\u2019t in pain but that just made them hurt even more all that\u00a0 just meant you weren\u2019t there anymore an you\u2019d never be there ever again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMommy\u201d a faint, pain filled whisper came from a child, breaking everyones hearts even more. Young Rebecca climbed in her mothers bed and shook her.\u00a0\u201cMommy wake up\u201d she said in a panic.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cBecca\u201d Chris tried to pulled hu daughter way but there was no use.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cMOMMY\u201d she yelled. She knew her mom was gone but yet she couldn\u2019t accept it. It was her mommy, her hero and she just couldn\u2019t believe that her hero was gone.\u00a0<br></p><p>There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the whole hallway. That day wasn\u2019t just a sorrow day for your family. It was a sorrow day for every single person that had ever met you, every person that had the pleasure of seeing your smile and feel your energy. Just few days after that horrible day the hospital put up a photo of you in memory of you and your energy. It said:\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>In memory of our beloved friend. We miss you every day, but we are still inspired by you.\u201d</i></p></p>",

No matter how good of a person you could be, no matter how hard you try and help other people a lot of times putting other needs up higher, you get hurt more then you deserve. All the bad people end up living on and having the best life while you are in so much pain.</p><p>\n\nIt was a sunny day and that meant you, Chris and your kids would be going out for a lovely family day. \n\n<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready mommy&rdquo; Rob yelled out running down the stairs. Your son ran down fully dressed, plus his inhaler, Frisbee and many other thing you hadn&rsquo;t noticed. He was the one in your family that worried about germs, animals and life in general. And you loved him for than even more.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great dear&rdquo; he ran up, gave you a kiss and looked over all the thing you were packing, to make user they were all up to code. For someone his age he was very much more mature then his age.&nbsp; You were worried he&rsquo;d be called a names in school because of his maturity , then again you knew he was going to do amazing things for the world and lucky for you and everyone Chris knew the&nbsp; same thing. He was the one to say it the day Rob was born, and he had still says it years later.&nbsp;</p><p>&lsquo;Okay, I see the most amazing wife here and just one amazing kid, where is the other amazing one&rdquo; Chris said entering the kitchen. You smiled at him while packing the lunch. Chris picked up Rob while tickling him,&nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your sister. Tell me, tell me now&rdquo; you smiled looking at them both and smiled even more when Rebecca ran into the room laughing and yelling she was there. You watched your sweet family and couldn&rsquo;t how lucky you had gotten in life.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s ready for an amazing day?&rdquo; Chris yelled our putting down your kids and going up to you and giving you a kiss.&nbsp;&ldquo;love you&rdquo; he whispered it to you. Chris had been doing that everyday for the past 10 years a small whisper just for you and only for you to hear it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You all got your thing together and went out. It was time to have the most amazing family day ever. There were so many plans for you all and a lot if it included playing games, taking photos, eating and just relaxing. When you and Chris found out you were pregnant a lot of things changed. One of them was Chris took time off worked. He started to work on tv-shows and small movies, he had always wanted to be on a tv-show and finally he could do that.&nbsp; When the kids came things changed even more, not only did Chris&nbsp; and you change work schedule, but also you both changed as people and you felt even better about yourself and life. It seemed you both had became even more happier then before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Having the family together was always important to you and Chris. For you and Chris it was important to have family time. You had family time at the same time, but always did something you. There were times family time had to be changed a bit if someone was sick, or Chris wasn&rsquo;t able to come home as fast as he would want. As much as you tried to imagine your life being still that amazing it wasn&rsquo;t true.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality you had spent the last few weeks in the hospitalize. You&rsquo;re last actual family times got ruined when you fell down at the park and ended up finding out you had cancer and there was nothing to do about it. Some how no one hadn&rsquo;t found out you had cancer even with all your check ups you had been doing. It was something you did once in a while after having kids. You wanted to be there for them, to be with Chris and see your kids grow up.&nbsp;When you fell to the ground everything fell with you. Not only did your life fall but everyones too. People tried to fake their smiles, laughs, they tried to look away from all the machines keeping you alive, they tried to look away from how you were getting weaker day by day. No matter how hard they tried to keep their spirits up you could see through them but you said nothing. You already felt horrible by being in the situation you were in, more because you felt bad seeing how hard it was on them, you felt like a burden on them, it made you want it all to end sooner, but at the same time you didn&rsquo;t want to leave your family, your loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you doing?&rdquo; your doctor said walking in with your papers,</p><p>&ldquo;Oh great, ran a marathon this morning, went to the gym afterwards thought the marathon wasn&rsquo;t enough&rdquo; your doctor loved your sense of humor. Even though you both knew that you hadn&rsquo;t been out of the bed without help in months, almost a year. He laughed and then gave you the same look he and everyone else give you. The look of pity and sadness, the looked you hated so damn much. Your doctor ,Mike, had became family. He knew all your family members by name and even knew what they liked and didn&rsquo;t like in drink and foods. Mike would bring food to your family if they stayed longer at the hospital then the cafeteria worked but also he knew the food wasn&rsquo;t the best.</p><p>&ldquo;And in reality?&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t letting gown. Mike knew you hated talking about yourself and most of the time you played down your pain and sadness so much, but with time he had learned what you really meant when saying things.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, a little tired, but fine.&rdquo; you said and as always didn&rsquo;t tell the full truth. In reality he didn&rsquo;t need you to say how it really was, all the nurses and doctors that had worked at the night shift already told him all the time you had vomited, had panic attacks and woken up in pain. Mike understood you not wanting to talk about all the horrible things that had happened to you at night, knowing you were already in pain and very tired of everything.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You and Mike talked a bit, he left right before Chris and your kids walked in your hospital room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mommy, mommy&rdquo; Rebecca and Rob yelled running in the room and jumping on the bed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Be careful&rdquo; Chris yelled out when they landed on the bad and seeing your pain filled face. You were in pain but you also were happy to see all of them. You missed them all the time. You missed telling bedtime stories to Rebecca. All those princess stories she loved and Rob acted he hated, while in reality he was standing behind the door listening to them. You missed Rob telling you the new things he found out about the world, all the medicine and new electronics created. You could already tell he was going to do some amazing things in life, you just wished you could be there to witness all of it.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>As usually Chris and the kids told all the things you had misses. Things that had happened in school and kindergarten. Like Rob had made a new friend that was fascinated with the same things as him and they were having a play-date, something that you wished you could attend too.&nbsp; Rebecca told you about all the things she had learned. She had learned how to write new letters and read knew words. With every story your beloved kids were telling you felt more and more pain. There were tears you were holding back, but it was getting hard to do that, since you really didn&rsquo;t have that much energy. Chris saw what was happening and asked nurse Jackie to look after them. They loved nurse Jackie and you loved her too, she had been best friend in the hospital. She helping you deal with everything, the pain, the panics you had in you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How are you sweetheart?&rdquo; Chris asked coming closer to you and taking your hand in his. Chris gave your hand 3&nbsp;squeezes, that was a secret signal between you and him. It had been something you did too each other from the moment the two of you started dating but didn&rsquo;t want everyone to know it. It was your sweet way to tell each other you loved that other person. You wanted to tell him you were fine, but you also knew it was a lie and Chris would be able to tell it was a lie. You were in pain, and looking in his eyes you felt more pain not because he&rsquo;d be giving you the pain. You felt pain because you knew you&rsquo;d have to leave him soon. Him and your amazing children. Children you had always wanted but now had to leave without a mother. Chris saw your tears and didn&rsquo;t say anything anymore, he just climbed in bed with you and hugged you. As you breathed in his sent that you missed every night when you were trying to fall asleep. Not having Chris by your side at night made it so much harder to fall asleep. Just when you thought you&rsquo;d be falling asleep in your husbands arms Mike walked in.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itCItPwyyYE&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLfoszboxNI5M21xPEUr7aW03LcPcdleAS&amp;index=4\">(Listen while reading)</a></p><p>&ldquo;Oh sorry&rdquo; Mike stopped but didn&rsquo;t leave.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry&rdquo; you looked at him and knew he wasn&rsquo;t apologizing for walking.

You hummed quietly to yourself while you planted the pink snapdragons next to the rows of tulips, daylilies, and pansies. Mom would be proud, you thought to yourself. You weren\u2019t much of a green thumb, but since Chris\u2019s landscaping had a small bare spot, you had staked your flowers and your claim.<b></b></p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 good babe,\u201d you heard a deep voice drawl. You smiled and looked over your shoulder. The Boston weather had been warming up; Chris stood behind you barefoot and clad in a simple short sleeve white t-shirt and dark washed jeans. You turned back to the flowers and jabbed your small trowel into a bare spot of dirt. You wiped the dirt off your jeans and hands; you turned back to Chris with a bright smile and pulled him into a soft hug.</p><p>\u201cAre you safe out here with these allergies of yours?\u201d you teased him. \u201cCan\u2019t send my best guy back to his press tour with the sniffles.\u201d You squeezed him before looking up with a smirk. </p><p>HIs chuckle rumbled low in his chest; you could feel the vibrations. \u201cI think I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><p>You stood up on tiptoes to meet him halfway as he leaned down to kiss you softly.</p><p>*</p><p>Chris was sitting on the couch watching the Boston Red Sox with Dodger at his side. You heard his moans and groans from the kitchen as you chopped up some lettuce and tomatoes for taco salad. A sudden loud noise startled you and you dropped the knife in your hand. The stainless steel knife clattered on the floor. You craned your head towards the living room.</p><p><b>\u201cWhat the hell kinda noise was that?\u201d</b> Your eyes twinkled as you tried to hold back a giggle. \u201cIt sounded like a cross between a fog horn and a dying duck.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cI sneezed,\u201d</b> was his short response.</p><p>The giggle erupted from you. <b>\u201cTHAT was not a sneeze!\u201d</b> Your look moved towards Dodger who was cowering under the end table farthest away from Chris. \u201cIt scared poor Dodger!\u201d Hearing his name, the dog moved and padded his way towards you. You grabbed a treat from the cupboard under you and gave it to him. \u201cYour daddy pwomised he\u2019d be ok,\u201d you baby talked to Dodger as you ruffled his head. \u201cSounds wike he\u2019s going to end up sick.\u201d</p><p>You straightened up and eyed Chris. \u201cYou better get some Benadryl or Claritin before it gets any worse,\u201d you cautioned.
