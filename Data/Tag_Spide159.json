But here it\u2019s back again :D It\u2019s about the friendship first starting to grow &lt;3 Enjoy!</p><!-- more --><p>The rich scent of chocolate filled Chloe\u2019s senses for a moment as she pulled back the clingfilm over a tub of homemade brownies. The new secretary at Oscorp had only been there a month or so, but she was looking to make friends where she could and give the other employees in the building a treat, including her boss, Norman Osborn. His days seemed split between his office building where Chloe worked, or the labs about a half hour drive away, so Chloe saw him more infrequently than most secretaries would their boss. But from what she experienced, he seemed like a nice man, a little aloof under the car salesman attitude he projected sure, but that seemed expected of a businessman. He was never rude when calling her about a job and he always mouthed a quick \u201cThanks\u201d as she set his coffee on the desk as he talked on the phone, before faking a laugh with whoever he was talking to at the time. </p><p>All seemed well, as she took out a nice big piece of the dessert and put it on a plate, complete with napkin and fork, grabbed the hot mug of expresso she sat on her desk, then headed in the direction of her boss\u2019s office. She mused in her head that he\u2019ll find it such a nice treat since she never saw Norman eat any sweets or &hellip; well, she didn\u2019t see him eat often actually, mostly he was just drinking coffee. But then maybe he doesn\u2019t like them or maybe he has really specific tastes, she soon started worrying. Still, Chloe didn\u2019t have too much time to worry, she had just reached the door to his office. After a bit of juggling with the food in her hands, she tapped on the door and waited for a reply. </p><p>No answer. Waiting a few seconds before tapping again, there was still no reply back. Chloe raised her eyebrow, usually he was back in his office for lunchtime after his morning meeting with the board members, maybe it was going overtime? Still, the door was locked and the coffee was going to get cold if she stood around for too long, so she decided to head in the direction of the meeting room. On the way there, she recognised a few faces being members of the board, walking through the halls away from the direction of the typical meeting spot. \u2018How odd.\u2019 she thought, the meeting was over and looked to have finished at the same time as normal, but Norman was nowhere to be found among the faces. Asking around, she got told that the last Norman was seen he was still seated in the board room, so Chloe continued on her journey, walking as brisk as she could in her heels to avoid cold coffee on her hands, but slow enough still to avoid hot coffee on her hands.</p><p>Arriving outside the large brown doors to the board room, Chloe repeated her adjustments before tapping away and waiting. This time a tired but familiar \u201cYes?\u201d was the reply, and so Chloe pushed down the handle and stepped in. On the other side of the room sat Norman, at his usual spot at the head of the table. This time however he didn\u2019t look as commandeering in his position, on his own and surrounded by the empty cups of the board members while he slumped over the table slightly, his blue eyes looking downwards and his thin lips were a visible frown. Norman looked up expecting a cleaner to come in, but was surprised by the sight of his secretary instead.</p><p>Still, Norman just as quickly erased the surprise from his face and flashed a forced smile in her direction. \u201cAh, Miss Fraser!\u201d he greeted in his distinct gravelly voice, \u201cSorry, I must have kept you waiting. My mind must have wandered.\u201d His white crooked teeth gritted together shut in the smile Chloe saw him use around his business partners, but his eyes still looked sad. Chloe approached his end of the table, smiling gently and setting his drink down on his coaster, replacing his old mug. \u201cThat\u2019s ok, sir! Thinking about much?\u201d she asked, hoping he might share what looked to be troubling him. Norman took a polite sip of the drink and replied, shaking his head slightly, \u201cNot really. Just reflecting on the meeting.\u201d At that, he expected her to make her leave like his previous secretaries would, but Chloe asked on. \u201cOh, how did the meeting go?\u201d she said, putting the plate down, still turned to him and smiling with her head leaning in to hear his answer. Norman\u2019s own smile loosened as he looked her up and down, not sure why she was so curious to know. Still he replied with a vague, \u201cWell, it was eventful. It\u2019ll be a hot topic for the next lab visit by the board anyway\u201d, before taking another sip. As eager as ever, Chloe once again asked \u201cOh, well what happened?\u201d</p><p>At this last question, Norman sat his drink back down then looked back up to Chloe and a forced chuckle escaped his lips. \u201cMiss Fraser,\u201d he began, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me these questions just because you\u2019re my employee, you know?\u201d Chloe cocked her head in slight confusion over his dismissive reaction, before replying with a smile \u201cI know, but I want to know if you\u2019re ok.\u201d Norman\u2019s brow raised and Chloe swore she could see the faintest touch of pink on her boss\u2019s sunken cheeks, before he quickly regained himself and responded, \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. But i\u2019m fine. Besides, you must be busy right now.\u201d Chloe let out a light giggle before explaining \u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime, Mr Osborn. I finished mine before coming up, so i\u2019m free for the next hour.\u201d, she then sat herself down in the chair closest to Norman\u2019s and placed the plate of brownie in front of him.</p><p>Norman\u2019s eyes widened before looking to Chloe again, brow cocked. \u201cIs this for me?\u201d he asked, pink cheeks returning. Chloe blushed just as hard through her grin, nodding and replying sheepishly \u201cI bake about once a month, so I thought i\u2019d start bringing them in to share. And a nice treat after a long meeting sounds pretty good i\u2019d say!\u201d Norman had looked back down to the baked good in front of him, still taking in her words, but processing just how &hellip; nice this was! No one ever asked him how he was doing at work unless it was just basic politeness or to suck up to him. But all these questions and the brownie, it was more effort than anyone had ever put in. As Norman looked back up to Chloe\u2019s kind smile, he found his mouth involuntarily twitching into a genuine smile back. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d was all he could muster up in his state of bewilderment, but she still smiled all the wider at his kind grin breaking through. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all! Now, what happened at the meeting?\u201d she asked again, arms folded in front of her on the table, ready for a story. Norman pursed his lips in thought, thinking it over a bit more on whether he should start talking about it proper still. Mid-thought, he took the fork into his hand and picked up a bit of brownie in it before eating. As soon as he started chewing, a sudden hum of pleasure left his lips as he took in the rich taste of dark chocolate. It was the best &hellip; well <i>only</i> brownie he had eaten in years. At that and with another look at Chloe, still beaming and blushing at his approval of her goods, his mind was made up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot to take in, i\u2019ll tell you Miss Fraser. But I can start at the beginning &hellip;\u201d</p>",

But here it\u2019s back again :D It\u2019s about the friendship first starting to grow &lt;3 Enjoy!</p>[[MORE]]<p>The rich scent of chocolate filled Chloe\u2019s senses for a moment as she pulled back the clingfilm over a tub of homemade brownies. The new secretary at Oscorp had only been there a month or so, but she was looking to make friends where she could and give the other employees in the building a treat, including her boss, Norman Osborn. His days seemed split between his office building where Chloe worked, or the labs about a half hour drive away, so Chloe saw him more infrequently than most secretaries would their boss. But from what she experienced, he seemed like a nice man, a little aloof under the car salesman attitude he projected sure, but that seemed expected of a businessman. He was never rude when calling her about a job and he always mouthed a quick \u201cThanks\u201d as she set his coffee on the desk as he talked on the phone, before faking a laugh with whoever he was talking to at the time. </p><p>All seemed well, as she took out a nice big piece of the dessert and put it on a plate, complete with napkin and fork, grabbed the hot mug of expresso she sat on her desk, then headed in the direction of her boss\u2019s office. She mused in her head that he\u2019ll find it such a nice treat since she never saw Norman eat any sweets or \u2026 well, she didn\u2019t see him eat often actually, mostly he was just drinking coffee. But then maybe he doesn\u2019t like them or maybe he has really specific tastes, she soon started worrying. Still, Chloe didn\u2019t have too much time to worry, she had just reached the door to his office. After a bit of juggling with the food in her hands, she tapped on the door and waited for a reply. </p><p>No answer. Waiting a few seconds before tapping again, there was still no reply back. Chloe raised her eyebrow, usually he was back in his office for lunchtime after his morning meeting with the board members, maybe it was going overtime? Still, the door was locked and the coffee was going to get cold if she stood around for too long, so she decided to head in the direction of the meeting room. On the way there, she recognised a few faces being members of the board, walking through the halls away from the direction of the typical meeting spot. \u2018How odd.\u2019 she thought, the meeting was over and looked to have finished at the same time as normal, but Norman was nowhere to be found among the faces. Asking around, she got told that the last Norman was seen he was still seated in the board room, so Chloe continued on her journey, walking as brisk as she could in her heels to avoid cold coffee on her hands, but slow enough still to avoid hot coffee on her hands.</p><p>Arriving outside the large brown doors to the board room, Chloe repeated her adjustments before tapping away and waiting. This time a tired but familiar \u201cYes?\u201d was the reply, and so Chloe pushed down the handle and stepped in. On the other side of the room sat Norman, at his usual spot at the head of the table. This time however he didn\u2019t look as commandeering in his position, on his own and surrounded by the empty cups of the board members while he slumped over the table slightly, his blue eyes looking downwards and his thin lips were a visible frown. Norman looked up expecting a cleaner to come in, but was surprised by the sight of his secretary instead.</p><p>Still, Norman just as quickly erased the surprise from his face and flashed a forced smile in her direction. \u201cAh, Miss Fraser!\u201d he greeted in his distinct gravelly voice, \u201cSorry, I must have kept you waiting. My mind must have wandered.\u201d His white crooked teeth gritted together shut in the smile Chloe saw him use around his business partners, but his eyes still looked sad. Chloe approached his end of the table, smiling gently and setting his drink down on his coaster, replacing his old mug. \u201cThat\u2019s ok, sir! Thinking about much?\u201d she asked, hoping he might share what looked to be troubling him. Norman took a polite sip of the drink and replied, shaking his head slightly, \u201cNot really. Just reflecting on the meeting.\u201d At that, he expected her to make her leave like his previous secretaries would, but Chloe asked on. \u201cOh, how did the meeting go?\u201d she said, putting the plate down, still turned to him and smiling with her head leaning in to hear his answer. Norman\u2019s own smile loosened as he looked her up and down, not sure why she was so curious to know. Still he replied with a vague, \u201cWell, it was eventful. It\u2019ll be a hot topic for the next lab visit by the board anyway\u201d, before taking another sip. As eager as ever, Chloe once again asked \u201cOh, well what happened?\u201d</p><p>At this last question, Norman sat his drink back down then looked back up to Chloe and a forced chuckle escaped his lips. \u201cMiss Fraser,\u201d he began, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me these questions just because you\u2019re my employee, you know?\u201d Chloe cocked her head in slight confusion over his dismissive reaction, before replying with a smile \u201cI know, but I want to know if you\u2019re ok.\u201d Norman\u2019s brow raised and Chloe swore she could see the faintest touch of pink on her boss\u2019s sunken cheeks, before he quickly regained himself and responded, \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. But i\u2019m fine. Besides, you must be busy right now.\u201d Chloe let out a light giggle before explaining \u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime, Mr Osborn. I finished mine before coming up, so i\u2019m free for the next hour.\u201d, she then sat herself down in the chair closest to Norman\u2019s and placed the plate of brownie in front of him.</p><p>Norman\u2019s eyes widened before looking to Chloe again, brow cocked. \u201cIs this for me?\u201d he asked, pink cheeks returning. Chloe blushed just as hard through her grin, nodding and replying sheepishly \u201cI bake about once a month, so I thought i\u2019d start bringing them in to share. And a nice treat after a long meeting sounds pretty good i\u2019d say!\u201d Norman had looked back down to the baked good in front of him, still taking in her words, but processing just how \u2026 nice this was! No one ever asked him how he was doing at work unless it was just basic politeness or to suck up to him. But all these questions and the brownie, it was more effort than anyone had ever put in. As Norman looked back up to Chloe\u2019s kind smile, he found his mouth involuntarily twitching into a genuine smile back. </p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d was all he could muster up in his state of bewilderment, but she still smiled all the wider at his kind grin breaking through. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all! Now, what happened at the meeting?\u201d she asked again, arms folded in front of her on the table, ready for a story. Norman pursed his lips in thought, thinking it over a bit more on whether he should start talking about it proper still. Mid-thought, he took the fork into his hand and picked up a bit of brownie in it before eating. As soon as he started chewing, a sudden hum of pleasure left his lips as he took in the rich taste of dark chocolate. It was the best \u2026 well <i>only</i> brownie he had eaten in years. At that and with another look at Chloe, still beaming and blushing at his approval of her goods, his mind was made up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hell of a lot to take in, i\u2019ll tell you Miss Fraser. But I can start at the beginning \u2026\u201d</p>",
