Tony Stark.\u00a0</p><p>Goddamn Iron Man stood in the entrance of your bar and stared you down! \u201eYou don&rsquo;t have a lot of clients, eh?\u201c, he asked with a smirk, came in and took the seat right in front of you at the counter. You snickered. \u201eNah, today came the new Iron Man merchandise and they all went shopping. What can I do for you, Mr. Stark?\u201c \u00a0He threw some money on the wooden board. \u201eWhiskey. A lot. And I need someone who doesn&rsquo;t treat me like a special snowflake.\u201c Now, you had to laugh and poured not just your customer, but also yourself a drink. You raised your glass to him and smiled widely. \u201eGood, I was never one for &lsquo;Mister&rsquo; and 'Sir&rsquo; anyway.Feel free to stay for a while.\u201c The glasses clanked and both of you took a sip. \u201eSo..\u201c, Tony started. \u201eSince you seem to be the owner of this sinkhole I assume you are Y/N?\u201c You looked surprised at him and wanted to ask where he got your name from, but he pointed at his phone with a grin. Ah, good old Google.. \u201eSo, Y/N.. Are you one of those barkeepers who listen to whatever sorrow their customers need to talk about?\u201c, he asked. \u201eNot really.\u201c, you answered quickly and with the most stern face you were capable of. \u201eBut lets make an exception for a special snowflake. Deal?\u201c He grimaced, but then you heard him chuckle. \u201eSassy and owns a bar. I think you are my new best friend now.\u201c You sighted over-theatrically: \u201eGods, why? Why me?\u201c He emptied his glass. \u201eBecause Karma is a bitch, darling.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>You winked at him. \u201eWhen someone knows this, it&rsquo;s you. Heard about New York in the news.\u201cTony rolled his eyes, but started to talk. You were used to listening to customers, because that&rsquo;s what every single barkeeper on the planet does. But you had to admit that this one, this \u201esuperhero\u201c, was entirely different. It took no long time for him to open up to you and soon, he was telling you things you were sure he doesn&rsquo;t tell anyone else. But he also wanted to hear about you! So you told him everything he asked for: about your past, your hobbies, how you got the bar and even more.  It was very late when he suddenly said: \u201eIt&rsquo;s truly a shame we haven&rsquo;t met sooner. I really think we would have been great friends.\u201c You smiled widely. \u201eUmh.. Better late than never, right?\u201c Tony laughed.\u00a0</p><p>A true, happy and real laugh. \u201eI was hoping for you to say that, Y/N. Gotta go now, but you need to visit me one day so I can introduce you to J.A.R.V.I.S.! You will hear from me soon, dear.\u201c\u00a0</p><p>He shook your hand and then, he was gone.Days over days gone by and you haven&rsquo;t heard anything from your new friend. Actually, you started to believe Tony wasn&rsquo;t serious about you visiting him or anything. You knew you could just drive to the villa and just say hi, but you were too shy. You needed to see him one more time first. Right when you decided to finally give up your hopes, you heard two voices coming from the entrance. \u201eWhat are we doing here, Tony? This place looks like trash!\u201c, said one of them. Then you saw Tony Starks back as he talked to the other man. \u201eBut the owner isn&rsquo;t, Rhodes! I want you to meed Y/N, the frist person after you who doesn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m totally crazy.\u201c You smiled at the two as they came to you to take a seat. Tonys companion offered you a hand. \u201eI&rsquo;m the other friend, James Rhodes. My condolences, it&rsquo;s impossible to get rid of him now.\u201c Tony grinned at both of you. \u201eThis is the start of something wonderful. And not just because of the booze, Rhodey.\u201c  </p><p><i>want more? /ask for a Request</i>  </p>",

Hela, their sister, is a witch who will sometimes travel with them (see; bully her brothers into taking her where she needs to go). Loki also has some magical talent. He can also cast minor illusions which he uses in battle. Thor can summon or banish storms to a more mild degree, making for smooth sailing. When all three of them are together, they\u2019re a damned sight for any sailor.<br/></li><li>Their crew consists of Bruce (Ship Doctor), Valkyrie (third in command), Heimdall (the longsuffered guide of their ship), Sif, Fandral, Hogon (Thor\u2019s usual landing party), Natasha (she showed up one day, nobody\u2019s actually sure if Loki invited her or not, not even Loki), Bucky (Lost his memories and was freed from HYDRA by Loki\u2019s crew so he stuck around), Clint (followed Natasha) and Stephen (magic user, fell in love with Loki and so he now travels around with him. He collects various magical artifacts to bring back to Wong for safekeeping).\u00a0</li><li>They decided to Kidnap Tony and hold him for ransom, as he\u2019s the current prince of Howard\u2019s kingdom and he\u2019s in an easy place for them to kidnap for some reason</li><li>While they\u2019re planning and arranging that, Peter whose best friends with Shuri, princess of the neighboring kingdom, Wakanda, Ned and MJ, all get the really stupid idea into their heads that they should go be pirates. Shuri\u2019s mostly just doing this because she told her brother\u00a0\u201cmaybe I\u2019ll go become a pirate then!\u201d in an argument and goddamn it if she backs down on this he\u2019ll never take her threats seriously. MJ is using this as a politcal protest. Also she thinks Shuri is cute and wants to follow her.</li><li>\u201cHow do you become a pirate?\u201d Peter asked.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure if we just hop on a pirate ship then we become pirates automatically.\u201d Replied Ned.\u00a0\u201cYeah that sounds about right.\u201d agreed the three teenagers who have never sailed in their life or meet an actual pirate.\u00a0</li><li>The plan to kidnap Tony is put into play, and that involves everyone but Heimdall leaving the ship. Heimdall was supposed to have several hours before anything was happening, so he decided to finally take a nap. As you may have guessed, that was a poor decision.</li><li>So the four teenagers hop on board of the\u00a0\u201cabandoned\u201d pirate ship they found.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Plot Device causes the kidnapping to need to speed up, the crew has grabbed Tony and is now rushing back.\u00a0</li><li>The crew returns and sets sail right away, not knowing there are four people Who Should Not Be There until it\u2019s too late.\u00a0</li><li>Loki, staring down these dumbass kids on his ship:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m just disappointed.\u201d\u00a0</li><li>Peter, breaking in 2 seconds flat:\u00a0\u201cBecoming pirates to annoy our families sounded like a good idea at the time!\u201d</li><li>Hela, crackling up laughing at all of this:\u00a0\u201cOh come on, you can\u2019t pretend that\u2019s not exactly how you and Thor got into this too!\u201d</li><li>Loki, resigned:\u00a0\u201cFine. Stay out of the battles. Shuri, if King T\u2019Challa comes after us too you get to explain that you\u2019re here by choice to him.

They sent the ransom note to Howard. Howard sends his navy after them in response. Steve is the captain of this navy, and also in love with Tony. Sam is his second in command. Howard\u2019s honestly not a great king and pretty assholish.\u00a0</li><li>There\u2019s a cat and mouse game of Steve trying to get Tony back, all the while Tony decides he likes being a pirate way more and he grows on the crew. He\u2019s also slowly falling in love with Loki + Stephen. Finally it all comes to a head in a battle. There\u2019s serious worry that their crew is going to lose and they\u2019re all going to die, and then Steve sees Bucky.</li><li>The moment Steve sees a still alive Bucky, he calls off the attack.

He thinks Bucky will come back with him/is also a prisoner.\u00a0</li><li>Then Bucky and Tony both turn him in to Loki when he tries to rescue them. Steve is ??? and trying to understand why they\u2019d betray him. Sam saw this coming but came anyways because he\u2019s a good friend like that. They don\u2019t even tie Sam up, he\u2019s just standing in the background of all of this like\u00a0\u201cyep, I told you buddy.\u201d</li><li>Both Bucky and Tony explain to Steve that they\u2019re happy where they are, Tony revels that he\u2019s dating Loki and Stephen now and points out his dad is an asshole to him. He also has basically adopted the four teenagers on the ship now. Bucky explains all that Loki and his crew have done for him, and that he still loves Steve, but can\u2019t leave his new family for him.\u00a0</li><li>Loki is really nice about this and offers to either let Steve join his crew or return him safely to the navy with the message that Tony isn\u2019t coming back. Steve has to think about it for awhile, but can\u2019t stand to lose Bucky again so he joins the ship. In the end, he actually ends up dating Bucky and Sam (who also joins, because again, Sam is fucking Loyal and a Good Damn Boyfriend)</li><li>After this, T\u2019Challa has finally had enough of Shuri\u2019s shit and sends his navy out after her, which is a hell of a lot more dangerous. Shuri and the teenagers agree to go back home, but only on the condition they can come back to Loki\u2019s ship from time to time.\u00a0</li><li>Alls well that ends well until 5 minutes from that point which is when they meet their rival ship holding the guardians.</li></ul><p>Okay, so that was less of a headcanon list and more of a outline.

His eyes glinted like he stole the stars in the night sky without a single remorse for what would be left every time he saw you walk by. He never lost the chance to watch movies with you and the rest of the team. And although he loved to spend time with you, he knew his hands would soon get sweaty, his pupils would dilate at the sight of you, and his voice&hellip;oh, boy &ndash; his voice would soon begin to shake like an earthquake.</p><p>Nevertheless, you were totally oblivious to Peter&rsquo;s behaviour. You were locked in your own bubble that you didn&rsquo;t even see what was going on around you.<br/>But your father did.</p><p>The one and only Tony Stark picked up his crush before you did. At first he found it he didn\u2019t know what to do, but then he decided it was time to sit down and have a proper talk with the boy.</p><p>\u201cParker!\u201d Tony said, pulling Peter into a tight embrace.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d he groaned from the lack of air.\u00a0\u201cHi.\u201d<br/></p><p>Feeling his mentor\u2019s intense gaze on him, Peter gulped a lumb and kept on walking along the hall. Was there any way to escape from Tony Stark? No, there was not.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming, buddy. How\u2019s school? Must be easy for a dude like you, huh? All girls must be at your mercy,\u201d Tony gave him a wink, earning an awkward look from Peter. Sighing, your father went on. \u201cAnyway, do you remember when you screw up the pooch hard?
