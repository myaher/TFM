But she can&rsquo;t let that happen. She can&rsquo;t let Jon Snow, the boy she is in love with, wake up with the blood of so many innocents on his hands. So she makes her way to the Dauntless headquarters to save Abnegation and Jon Snow.</small></p><p><i><small>Divergent AU // Dystopian AU</small></i></p></blockquote><p>The streets of Westeros were empty. The sun had already set and most people hid safely inside. It was as if they felt that there was something in the air, something wicked, something morbid, something sinister. </p><p>Sansa didn\u2019t just feel it. She knew what was going to happen. And she knew she would have to reach Jon before it was too late. So she rushed through the empty streets. Her lungs were struggling to get enough breath. Her hearts fought to pump her blood into her fingertips and toes. But adrenaline filled her veins to keep her going. She ignored the stings in her side and the pain in her feet. She had sprained both her ankles already, but she had more important things to worry about.</p><p>Jon. Jon Snow. The boy she loved even though she was not allowed to have a crush on him. He was her cousin. He was her brother\u2019s best friend. He was in Dauntless while she was in Erudite. </p><p>But if she wouldn\u2019t do something now, he would wake up tomorrow morning with the blood of way too many innocents on his hands. </p><p>And he would never be able to forgive himself. </p><p>She would never be able to forgive herself. She just couldn\u2019t let it happen. She had to find a way to get to Jon to stop this before anyone would get hurt or worse.</p><p>But when she reached the Dauntless headquarters her heart stopped beating and her feet stopped running.</p><p>Countless of armed soldiers walked out of the doors towards the waiting trains. Their eyes seemed empty, as if their bodies were moving but their souls weren\u2019t at home. They had their hands on their giant guns and all their movements were perfectly synchronised.</p><p>Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. </p><!-- more --><p>Sansa pressed herself to the wall to stay out of sight while she scanned the crowd. She recognised quite a few people, people she wanted to save. But she couldn\u2019t save everyone. Not on her own. She had to find Jon first.</p><p>Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right.</p><p>Sansa held her breath when one of the commanders who was not under the influence of the program made his way through the robotised crowd.</p><p>He wore a sickening smirk on his face and whenever he walked past a pretty girl his hand squeezed her ass, without a doubt hurting her. </p><p>But none of the girls noticed.</p><p>Sansa let out a deep sigh when he was finally out of sight and she squeezed her eyes when she noticed the familiar messy black curls. </p><p>Left.

She had a million of questions, but none of them seemed to matter right now. Not before they had found a way to stop this madness. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d She looked around, but she felt Jon\u2019s hand grabbing hers and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;re gonna save Abnegation and the Dauntless consciences.\u201d He let the last soldiers pass them and they watched how the doors of the trains closed when everyone was inside.</p><p>They had no idea how fast the trains would get them to the Abnegation district. And they had no idea how long it would be until the commanders and the Erudite leaders would give the command to start the massacre.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sansa was out of breath and now the adrenaline was wearing off she started to feel the pain in both her ankles. </p><p>Jon squeezed her hand once more and for the first time this evening he looked at her. His eyes weren\u2019t empty. They were filled with fear and panic. </p><p>\u201cWe need to get to Robb and father and the others.\u201d Sansa bit her bottom lip. \u201cI should have gone to them first, but\u2026\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d </p><p>Jon\u2019s lips curled up into a slight smile and he pressed the palms of his hands to her cheeks before he leaned down to kiss her lips briefly. \u201cI know.\u201d He kissed her once more. \u201cI would have done the same.\u201d He tucked a strand of bright red hair behind her ear. \u201cI know where the jeeps are. We\u2019ll go get one of them to go ho\u2026\u201d He paused in the middle of his word. \u201cTo go to Candor.\u201d</p><p>This time it was Sansa\u2019s turn to smile, even though it was just a little. At least she wasn\u2019t the only one who still thought of Candor as her true home, even though she was Erudite now.</p><p>Once more Jon reached for her hand and then he started walking.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>He kept them hidden in the shadows of the buildings. Once in a while he stood still and wrapped his arms around Sansa to muffle her heavy breathing.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you controlled?\u201d She could barely keep up with him while he started to walk faster.</p><p>Eventually he stood still in front of a giant hangar and he used his foot to kick a hole in the door big enough for them to fit through. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not actually dauntless.\u201d He pulled her along towards a small cabinet attached to the wall. \u201cI\u2019m Candor. And Abnegation. And Amity. And Erudite. And Dauntless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat&rsquo;s impossible.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a key and Sansa almost stumbled over her own feet while he pulled her towards one of the jeeps. With one smooth movement he lifted her up and placed her in the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cIt&rsquo;s not.\u201d He rushed to the other side and jumped in himself. \u201cMaybe you can look into it after we\u2019ve solved this mess.\u201d</p><p>Sansa swallowed. \u201cIf they\u2026\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIf they find out that I came to warn you. I don\u2019t think I can ever go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they find out that I couldn\u2019t be controlled I can never go back either.\u201d He started the jeep and stepped on the gas to ride through what little was left of the door he had just kicked in. \u201cDon&rsquo;t worry, okay?\u201d He pushed the jeep to its limit. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Never. Wherever you go, I\u2019ll go too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa leaned back in her seat while she held onto the door. \u201cJon?\u201d She took a deep breath and then she turned her face towards him, knowing very well that he couldn\u2019t look back at her. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d It was the first time she said the words out loud. She had thought them countless of times already. But like her father had taught her, thoughts didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cSay that again when we survive this, okay?\u201d Jon smirked however and Sansa noticed how he had used when and not if. </p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI&rsquo;ll say it again and again until you get tired of hearing me say it.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second Jon let his glance meet hers before he focussed on the road again. \u201cImpossible. I\u2019ll never get tired of it.\u201d</p>",

She had no idea how to snap him out of this, how to get him away from the crowd, how to save him from himself and the horrible people who had come up with this plan in the first place. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d Jon didn\u2019t blink, but his lips were moving. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He hissed between his teeth. \u201cIf they find you they\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna kill them, Jon.\u201d Sansa interrupted him. Her hands were shaking now and her voice was trembling. \u201cThey\u2019re sending you to Abnegation to kill them.\u201d Her chest was moving up and down rapidly. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d She reached for his arm and curled her fingers around it. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jon kept silent. He still moved exactly like all the others.</p><p>Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re controlling them.\u201d Jon spoke softly but he slowed down his movements, letting the soldier behind him pass. \u201cThey have to control them from somewhere.\u201d He slowed down once more and more soldiers passed him. </p><p>Sansa made sure to copy his movements, even though her blue clothes stood out among all the black anyway. She had a million of questions, but none of them seemed to matter right now. Not before they had found a way to stop this madness. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d She looked around, but she felt Jon\u2019s hand grabbing hers and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna save Abnegation and the Dauntless consciences.\u201d He let the last soldiers pass them and they watched how the doors of the trains closed when everyone was inside.</p><p>They had no idea how fast the trains would get them to the Abnegation district. And they had no idea how long it would be until the commanders and the Erudite leaders would give the command to start the massacre.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Sansa was out of breath and now the adrenaline was wearing off she started to feel the pain in both her ankles. </p><p>Jon squeezed her hand once more and for the first time this evening he looked at her. His eyes weren\u2019t empty. They were filled with fear and panic. </p><p>\u201cWe need to get to Robb and father and the others.\u201d Sansa bit her bottom lip. \u201cI should have gone to them first, but\u2026\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d </p><p>Jon\u2019s lips curled up into a slight smile and he pressed the palms of his hands to her cheeks before he leaned down to kiss her lips briefly. \u201cI know.\u201d He kissed her once more. \u201cI would have done the same.\u201d He tucked a strand of bright red hair behind her ear. \u201cI know where the jeeps are. We\u2019ll go get one of them to go ho\u2026\u201d He paused in the middle of his word. \u201cTo go to Candor.\u201d</p><p>This time it was Sansa\u2019s turn to smile, even though it was just a little. At least she wasn\u2019t the only one who still thought of Candor as her true home, even though she was Erudite now.</p><p>Once more Jon reached for her hand and then he started walking.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d</p><p>He kept them hidden in the shadows of the buildings. Once in a while he stood still and wrapped his arms around Sansa to muffle her heavy breathing.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you controlled?\u201d She could barely keep up with him while he started to walk faster.</p><p>Eventually he stood still in front of a giant hangar and he used his foot to kick a hole in the door big enough for them to fit through. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not actually dauntless.\u201d He pulled her along towards a small cabinet attached to the wall. \u201cI\u2019m Candor. And Abnegation. And Amity. And Erudite. And Dauntless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a key and Sansa almost stumbled over her own feet while he pulled her towards one of the jeeps. With one smooth movement he lifted her up and placed her in the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He rushed to the other side and jumped in himself. \u201cMaybe you can look into it after we\u2019ve solved this mess.\u201d</p><p>Sansa swallowed. \u201cIf they\u2026\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIf they find out that I came to warn you. I don\u2019t think I can ever go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they find out that I couldn\u2019t be controlled I can never go back either.\u201d He started the jeep and stepped on the gas to ride through what little was left of the door he had just kicked in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, okay?\u201d He pushed the jeep to its limit. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Never. Wherever you go, I\u2019ll go too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa leaned back in her seat while she held onto the door. \u201cJon?\u201d She took a deep breath and then she turned her face towards him, knowing very well that he couldn\u2019t look back at her. </p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d It was the first time she said the words out loud. She had thought them countless of times already. But like her father had taught her, thoughts didn\u2019t count.</p><p>\u201cSay that again when we survive this, okay?\u201d Jon smirked however and Sansa noticed how he had used when and not if. </p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll say it again and again until you get tired of hearing me say it.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second Jon let his glance meet hers before he focussed on the road again. \u201cImpossible. I\u2019ll never get tired of it.\u201d</p>",
