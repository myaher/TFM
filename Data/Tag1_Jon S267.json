        "body": "<p>Jon\u2019s story last season was very simple, straightforward and\ntrue to character. And that\u2019s why all these long metas from Jonsa/Sansa stans\ntrying to add 10 layers of deceit and manipulation to Jon\u2019s actions and make him\nundercover!Jon comes off as so idiotic. Like Why? <br/></p><p>So let me see if I can explain Jon\u2019s POV last season&hellip;<br/></p><p>Jon starts off the season as King\nin the North. We see him ruling wisely and making several important decisions. He\ndecides that it\u2019s better to get the loyalty of the Umber and Karstark children rather\nthan their anger. Jon then sets the women\nand children to train and sends the Wildlings to man the wall. He starts\npreparing for defending the North. But he lacks weapons and men. The North is\ndepleted after their losses in Robb\u2019s war. <br/></p><p>Jon gets a missive from Tyrion\nasking him to pay the folks at Dragonstone a visit. Jon knows Tyrion and thinks\nof him as a friend. Davos points out the dragons that could kill wights\u2026Hmm.\nBut too dangerous for now. Then he gets a missive from Sam about the dragonglass\nand decides that a visit down south is worth the risk \u2013 he desperately needs\nthat dragonglass. \u00a0So Jon leaves and puts\nhis sister in charge of holding down the fort in WF \u2013 trusting that she can\nhandle the job. </p><p>Once down south, Jon is first\nawed by Dany\u2019s beauty and then they get into a fierce discussion about bending\nthe knee and white walkers and stuff. Dany apologizes to Jon for what her\nfather did, taking him aback and he notices that Dany has not yet attacked KL\ndespite her dragons and dothraki. This is where Jon gets a hint that Dany is\ndifferent and not like Cersei. But he still does not know her and is therefore\nnot ready to bend the knee in return for her help. Similarly, Dany has no reason for wanting to\nhelp a rebel KITN who wants her help defeating some unseen threat without\ngiving her anything in return. They are at a stalemate. </p><p>Jon remembers why he came to\nDragonstone in the first place. Dany agrees to Jon mining the dragonglass and\noffers her men to help Jon mine them. Another point in favor of Dany \u2013 we can\nsee that Jon is genuinely impressed in their cliff side chat. And the\nattraction between them starts. One can sense that things are changing in the\nlittle glances that they exchange. </p><p>Jon then wants to show Dany the\ncaves and the drawings. They talk, Dany throws Jon\u2019s words back at him and there\nis a lot of sexual tension between them. Dany is starting to respect Jon as a\nleader, asks for his advice and takes it. Jon walks around Dragonstone asking\npeople about Dany and getting to know her. Missandei\u2019s opinion of Dany makes\nDavos want to change sides! Here, Jon is getting to hear about Dany from her\npeople and starts to understand that she is a good queen. Dany returns, Jon\npets Drogon and they have another little cliffside chat. Jorah appears making\nJon feel the first pangs of jealousy\u2026.</p><p>Next is the wight hunt discussion.\nThe idea is Tyrion\u2019s and Jon and Dany are already feeling something for each\nother at this stage. Jorah volunteering pushes Jon to lead the mission and Dany\nis sad about this. Jon leaves, gets into trouble and sends Dany a SOS for help \u2013\ntrusting that she will respond. And she does. She helps against Tyrion\u2019s advice\nand at great cost to herself. Despite this, she promises Jon that they will\ndefeat the WW together. And this is where Jon realizes that Dany is indeed a\ngood and righteous queen. And recognizing that Dany is a Good Queen, Jon bends\nthe knee. It\u2019s as simple as that. </p><p>Should Jon have discussed all\nthis with the Northerners and his sister before bending the knee? Probably. But\nthat\u2019s not who Jon is. Both in the books and on the show, Jon almost always\nmakes unilateral decisions. In WF, he did not listen to or follow one single\npiece of suggestion/advice given by Sansa. He suddenly announces that he is leaving\nfor the south and that Sansa is in charge without discussing any of this before\nhand. He suddenly announces that he will go on the wight hunt against Davos\u2019\nadvice. He suddenly announces at the dragonpit that he has already bend the knee\nto Dany. In the books, Jon makes several unilateral decisions that are unpopular\namong the NW brothers, leading to mutiny and assassination. So him making what\nhe thinks is the right decision without consulting Sansa or Glover is very in\ncharacter for him. </p><p>Is it the right decision? I think so. Dany is\noffering her armies, dragons, advisers and services to help the North. Should\nnot Jon help Dany in return? As Tyrion says, does not Jon and the Starks have\nmore reason to hate Cersei than Dany? Would Cersei leave the Starks alone?\nWould not fighting with Dany be better than fighting against Dany for the\nNorth? In the aftermath of an existential threat, would it not be better to band together as an union rather than independent kingdoms? As the GreatJon said, the North seceded because of the Lannisters and not the Targaryens. <br/></p><p>By allying with Dany, \u00a0Jon is doing the very opposite of Robb. Unlike\nRobb throwing away an useful alliance for love, Jon is allying himself with one\nof the strongest powers of Westeros to take down two enemies they have in\ncommon \u2013 the WW and Cersei. </p><p>And finally Jon\u2019s words at the\ndragonpit is the hallmark of a true leader. As the writers and actors\nthemselves mention \u2013 that scene was very poignant because it was filmed on the\nday Trump was elected. And as we see with Trump, if leaders don\u2019t uphold their\nwords and deals, what worth do their words have? Trump backing out of the Iran\ndeal means that the world is never going to trust any future treaty with the\nUnited States. That Jon recognizes the significance of staying true to his word\ndoes not mean that he is an idiot \u2013 rather it shows that he was the only one\nthere to understand why that is important. In the future Westeros, Jon will be\npretty much the only person anyone can trust to make deals and write treaties. </p><p>So in conclusion, Jon Snow is a good and smart leader. He is returning to WF with lots of dragonglass\nweapons, dragons, armies, advisers and some awesome fighters to help him deal\nwith the WW threat. Along the way he fell in love with a fiery, beautiful dragon\nqueen who saved his ass, respects him as a leader and promised him that they would deal with any threat <b><i>together</i></b>.

            "comment": "<p>Jon\u2019s story last season was very simple, straightforward and\ntrue to character. And that\u2019s why all these long metas from Jonsa/Sansa stans\ntrying to add 10 layers of deceit and manipulation to Jon\u2019s actions and make him\nundercover!Jon comes off as so idiotic. Like Why? <br></p><p>So let me see if I can explain Jon\u2019s POV last season\u2026<br></p><p>Jon starts off the season as King\nin the North. We see him ruling wisely and making several important decisions. He\ndecides that it\u2019s better to get the loyalty of the Umber and Karstark children rather\nthan their anger. Jon then sets the women\nand children to train and sends the Wildlings to man the wall. He starts\npreparing for defending the North. But he lacks weapons and men. The North is\ndepleted after their losses in Robb\u2019s war. <br></p><p>Jon gets a missive from Tyrion\nasking him to pay the folks at Dragonstone a visit. Jon knows Tyrion and thinks\nof him as a friend. Davos points out the dragons that could kill wights\u2026Hmm.\nBut too dangerous for now. Then he gets a missive from Sam about the dragonglass\nand decides that a visit down south is worth the risk \u2013 he desperately needs\nthat dragonglass. \u00a0So Jon leaves and puts\nhis sister in charge of holding down the fort in WF \u2013 trusting that she can\nhandle the job. </p><p>Once down south, Jon is first\nawed by Dany\u2019s beauty and then they get into a fierce discussion about bending\nthe knee and white walkers and stuff. Dany apologizes to Jon for what her\nfather did, taking him aback and he notices that Dany has not yet attacked KL\ndespite her dragons and dothraki. This is where Jon gets a hint that Dany is\ndifferent and not like Cersei. But he still does not know her and is therefore\nnot ready to bend the knee in return for her help. Similarly, Dany has no reason for wanting to\nhelp a rebel KITN who wants her help defeating some unseen threat without\ngiving her anything in return. They are at a stalemate. </p><p>Jon remembers why he came to\nDragonstone in the first place. Dany agrees to Jon mining the dragonglass and\noffers her men to help Jon mine them. Another point in favor of Dany \u2013 we can\nsee that Jon is genuinely impressed in their cliff side chat. And the\nattraction between them starts. One can sense that things are changing in the\nlittle glances that they exchange. </p><p>Jon then wants to show Dany the\ncaves and the drawings. They talk, Dany throws Jon\u2019s words back at him and there\nis a lot of sexual tension between them. Dany is starting to respect Jon as a\nleader, asks for his advice and takes it. Jon walks around Dragonstone asking\npeople about Dany and getting to know her. Missandei\u2019s opinion of Dany makes\nDavos want to change sides! Here, Jon is getting to hear about Dany from her\npeople and starts to understand that she is a good queen. Dany returns, Jon\npets Drogon and they have another little cliffside chat. Jorah appears making\nJon feel the first pangs of jealousy\u2026.</p><p>Next is the wight hunt discussion.\nThe idea is Tyrion\u2019s and Jon and Dany are already feeling something for each\nother at this stage. Jorah volunteering pushes Jon to lead the mission and Dany\nis sad about this. Jon leaves, gets into trouble and sends Dany a SOS for help \u2013\ntrusting that she will respond. And she does. She helps against Tyrion\u2019s advice\nand at great cost to herself. Despite this, she promises Jon that they will\ndefeat the WW together. And this is where Jon realizes that Dany is indeed a\ngood and righteous queen. And recognizing that Dany is a Good Queen, Jon bends\nthe knee. It\u2019s as simple as that. </p><p>Should Jon have discussed all\nthis with the Northerners and his sister before bending the knee? Probably. But\nthat\u2019s not who Jon is. Both in the books and on the show, Jon almost always\nmakes unilateral decisions. In WF, he did not listen to or follow one single\npiece of suggestion/advice given by Sansa. He suddenly announces that he is leaving\nfor the south and that Sansa is in charge without discussing any of this before\nhand. He suddenly announces that he will go on the wight hunt against Davos\u2019\nadvice. He suddenly announces at the dragonpit that he has already bend the knee\nto Dany. In the books, Jon makes several unilateral decisions that are unpopular\namong the NW brothers, leading to mutiny and assassination. So him making what\nhe thinks is the right decision without consulting Sansa or Glover is very in\ncharacter for him. </p><p>Is it the right decision? I think so. Dany is\noffering her armies, dragons, advisers and services to help the North. Should\nnot Jon help Dany in return? As Tyrion says, does not Jon and the Starks have\nmore reason to hate Cersei than Dany? Would Cersei leave the Starks alone?\nWould not fighting with Dany be better than fighting against Dany for the\nNorth? In the aftermath of an existential threat, would it not be better to band together as an union rather than independent kingdoms? As the GreatJon said, the North seceded because of the Lannisters and not the Targaryens. <br></p><p>By allying with Dany, \u00a0Jon is doing the very opposite of Robb. Unlike\nRobb throwing away an useful alliance for love, Jon is allying himself with one\nof the strongest powers of Westeros to take down two enemies they have in\ncommon \u2013 the WW and Cersei. </p><p>And finally Jon\u2019s words at the\ndragonpit is the hallmark of a true leader. As the writers and actors\nthemselves mention \u2013 that scene was very poignant because it was filmed on the\nday Trump was elected. And as we see with Trump, if leaders don\u2019t uphold their\nwords and deals, what worth do their words have? Trump backing out of the Iran\ndeal means that the world is never going to trust any future treaty with the\nUnited States. That Jon recognizes the significance of staying true to his word\ndoes not mean that he is an idiot \u2013 rather it shows that he was the only one\nthere to understand why that is important. In the future Westeros, Jon will be\npretty much the only person anyone can trust to make deals and write treaties. </p><p>So in conclusion, Jon Snow is a good and smart leader. He is returning to WF with lots of dragonglass\nweapons, dragons, armies, advisers and some awesome fighters to help him deal\nwith the WW threat. Along the way he fell in love with a fiery, beautiful dragon\nqueen who saved his ass, respects him as a leader and promised him that they would deal with any threat <b><i>together</i></b>. And that was Jon\u2019s story\nin season 7. </p>",

Robb &amp; Ella being absolutely determined to get their best friends to date bc it\u2019s so damn obvious to everyone else &amp; finally get them each to go on a blind date but it\u2019s with eachother?? idk if that\u2019s any good and again only if it inspires you oh my gosh<br/></p><p>As a PSA to all: I love prompts! Please send along.</p><p><br/></p><p>**</p><p>Jon walked into <i>Last Hearth</i>, one of those New-Westerosi restaurants obsessed with brussel sprouts and truffle oil, at three minutes to 8 o\u2019clock on Friday night.\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much for these kinds of restaurants, preferring to eat at home or at Winterfell, but of all of them, this was admittedly his favorite.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOkay just remember you like The Wight vintage 74 and the meatloaf,\u201d Ella said to him as he pulled on the charcoal sweater she\u2019d insisted he wear.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cElla I can order for myself!,\u201d he growled, annoyed by how much more comfortable he felt in the sweater she\u2019d suggested than the button down he\u2019d intended to wear. \u201cJust like I can find my own dates!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you were better at finding your own dates we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation, now would we?,\u201d she asked with a skeptical raise of her brow. Her face softened, \u201cAnd I know you are perfectly capable of deciding what to eat and drink and everything else\u2026 I just want you to be happy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you do, Ella,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ella was always well-intentioned. It was frustrating. Not as frustrating as her always being right though.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow is this really necessary?,\u201d he asked, holding up the flower she\u2019d given him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cA winter rose. She\u2019ll have one too.\u201d</i></p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t quite believe that he\u2019d agreed to a blind date. He had never been on one before, and quite honestly, they had always been his nightmare. He wasn\u2019t really one for small talk and that was all a blind date could be.\u00a0</p><p>Plus the uncertainty of it all. At least with a regular first date you know the girl found you <i>mildly </i>appealing. This was a total shot in the dark.\u00a0</p><p>He gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d. That was all a part of it, Ella loved suspense.\u00a0</p><p>He was ushered over to a table in the corner. He knew it must be coveted, two corners of it were on a banquette, which Ella had told him long ago made things more <i>romantic. </i>According to her, Robb would always whisper sweet things in her ear over dessert, though according to Robb, they were usually utterly filthy.\u00a0</p><p>He sat down and waited, setting the blue rose onto the table in front of him. He wanted a glass of whiskey, but he knew that wouldn\u2019t exactly make the best impression on his date and he had been assured by both Robb and Ella that she was worth making a good impression on her.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s stunning,\u201d Ella said.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd so sweet,\u201d Robb confirmed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll adore her,\u201d Ella promised.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI bet by the end of dinner you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d Robb offered.\u00a0</i></p><!-- more --><p>Jon highly doubted it, even though he usually trusted Robb and Ella implicitly.\u00a0</p><p>He turned towards the door and saw a slender figure in a navy blue dress being escorted right towards him. He saw the rose before anything else and then his eyes landed on the most beautiful face he\u2019d ever seen.\u00a0</p><p>He stood up, his throat was dry and he really wished he\u2019d given in and had that whiskey.\u00a0</p><p>She looked at him questioningly, as though she didn\u2019t understand why the maitre\u2019d was bringing her towards him, so he reached on the table and picked up the winter rose, waving it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Realisation dawned in her eyes and he looked away from them in case disappointment came to rest there. He wasn\u2019t sure that he could take it if he did.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon Snow,\u201d she said by way of greeting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he offered in return.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d </i>Robb had said. Robb his hilarious and completely dead best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Oh he\u2019d known her for years, ever since he\u2019d met Robb in pre-school and she\u2019d been gurgling happily in her bouncy seat. He\u2019d known her for all but one of her twenty five years.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been in love with her for at least twelve of them.</p><p>***</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe that she\u2019d allowed Robb to talk her into this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d caught her of guard last week by asking. In all her life, she had never known her big brother to encourage her to date. He wanted her to be happy, she knew, but if that happiness could be achieved by spending all of her time safe with him and Ella and their family then more the better.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you want to set me up with someone,\u201d she scoffed, \u201cAren\u2019t you the same man who has threatened every one of my last four boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Robb nodded, stuffing his face with the lemon bars she\u2019d made for the whole family. The plate was now halfway gone. \u201cBut that\u2019s because they were assholes who didn\u2019t deserve you. At least this way, I know he\u2019s a good guy. He doesn\u2019t deserve you - no one could - but he won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she whined.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was so good, and so caring, it was obnoxious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever have, never will,\u201d he grinned,\u201cCome on Dovey. Give happiness just one more chance.\u201d</i></p><p>So it was that at 8 o\u2019clock on the dot she walked into Last Hearth, her favorite restaurant in the city (they had the yummiest brussel sprouts).\u00a0</p><p>She smoothed down the dress Robb had suggested, though she suspected that came from Ella. It was navy blue and silk and she was pleased that other patrons were dressed similarly. It was a great tragedy that no one seemed to dress up anymore and she wouldn\u2019t want her date to think she\u2019d been <i>so </i>eager to please.\u00a0</p><p>She gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d and he nodded at her and escorted her through the dining room.</p><p>She fiddled with the Winter Rose she held in her hand nervously and looked around.\u00a0</p><p>Then, to her utter dismay, she saw Jon Snow of all people sitting at the corner table.</p><p><i>Why does he have to be here? Couldn\u2019t the gods have at least given whatever poor bastard has been set up with me a chance? How am I supposed to care about them when Jon Elliot Snow is sitting a few tables away?</i></p><p>Jon stood up when he saw her and she was about to say to the maitre\u2019d that she was just going to greet a friend quickly when he waved something at her. A single Winter Rose.\u00a0</p><p>She tried to keep her face placid, though she searched his for signs of disappointment. He averted her gaze and her stomach plummetted. Of course, he had thought tonight was a date, a real date with a girl he might really be interested in. She wondered briefly if he had thought that he was going to get laid tonight and blushed at the thought.\u00a0</p><p>The maitre\u2019d stood in front of Jon with a flourish as though this was a great unveiling and she mustered all of her strength to greet him with a calm, \u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he said in that velvet voice that always made her name sound like a caress.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour waiter will be with you in a moment,\u201d the maitre\u2019d said and took his leave.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 I assume that Winter Rose isn\u2019t a coincidence?,\u201d Jon asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to pretend that it was?,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u00a0</p><p>He blanched and she regretted it instantly but he recovered quickly, a small smile whispering in the corner of his eyes, \u201cOf course not. You look beautiful, Dovey,\u201d he said kissing her cheek, \u201cLike always.\u201d</p><p>He had always been kind, unfailingly so, and he\u2019d been calling her beautiful since before she knew that not everyone in the world was. It didn\u2019t <i>mean </i>anything, she knew that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell you certainly clean up nice,\u201d she said back, \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose that color over the blue.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing the sweater she\u2019d bought him for his birthday last year. Another detail to thank Ella for she was sure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he nodded, the tips of his ears turning pink, \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite\u2026 should we um\u2026?,\u201d he asked gesturing to the banquette.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d she nodded and they sat down.\u00a0</p><p>They were seated at the corner table, the most romantic one in the restaurant, and according to Northern Times, the most romantic one in the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026,\u201d she said, suddenly completely incapable of thinking of anything interesting to say.\u00a0</p><p>Love had a way of making a smart girl stupid.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think this will work?,&rdquo; Robb asked her.</p><p>Ella rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Are you starting to doubt me now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said, pulling her to him, &ldquo;I just know how stubborn they are&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is why our intervention was necessary,\u201d she reasoned, running her hands over his sweater-clad chest. She wrapped her arms around him and laid her cheek over his heart and went on, \u201cThe good news is that they are as predictable as they are stubborn. In fact, I can tell you exactly how it&rsquo;s going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?,\u201d he asked with a grin, \u201cGo on then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst&hellip; they are going to to act as though they are angry with us because neither of them realises that the other one is just as head over heels for <i>them</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <i>kill </i>Robb and Ella,&rdquo; Jon grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a little unfair,&rdquo; she scoffed and his eyes widened. He opened his mouth to protest, to tell her that he didn&rsquo;t mean that in a bad way about her, but she said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way Robb had the foresight to do this. Killing Ella will probably be sufficient.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled and nodded, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll forgive him, he knows not what he does.&rdquo;</p><p>She giggled wind chimes and then her face fell, &ldquo;Do you&hellip; Well&hellip; I mean&hellip; I&rsquo;d understand if you wanted to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your Friday evening&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Ruin. You&rsquo;re cute.</i></p><p>How many times had he imagined asking her out? No more than the number of times that he\u2019d chickened out.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d been mad about her at least since she was thirteen years old. Before then he hadn\u2019t quite <i>realised </i>why he always got sweaty around her and why her opinion seemed to matter so much.\u00a0</p><p>It had all changed on her thirteenth birthday. It was the first year she had a boy-girl party and he and Robb and Theon had all promised to attend. It was no skin off Robb\u2019s nose who had already been dating Ella for a year at that point, having realised much earlier (at the age of eight during a terrible thunderstorm) that she was his beloved. \u00a0</p><p>They played spin the bottle and Sansa had spun first, she being the birthday girl. He had somehow been next to Joffrey, Ella\u2019s horrible older brother, and the bottle had landed right in between them. It had been Joffrey who had taken the bottle and turned it towards himself before marching proudly over and planting a kiss on Sansa\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p><p>She had been beet red but his knuckles had been white he was so angry. He realised then that he wasn\u2019t just angry, he was <i>jealous</i>, and more than anything he was <i>upset</i> that it hadn\u2019t been him.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d pushed those feelings down, always coming up with some excuse or other not to pursue her. But now sitting next to her all of those excuses fell right out of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well um&hellip; we&rsquo;re both here, right?,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;We have to eat&hellip; and I know how much you love their kale or whatever green thing is most popular this week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their <i>brussel sprouts </i>and they are <i>iconic </i>and <i>timeless</i>,<i>&rdquo; </i>she said haughtily.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said, picking up his menu with a flourish and earning that giggle again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well that could last through dessert&hellip;,&rdquo; Robb reasoned.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Ella said with a smile, &ldquo;Because then we bring out the trump card&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>It became quite clear that in order for her to get through this date, alcohol would have to be involved.</p><p>They\u2019d at least made it through the initial awkwardness, there was no icebreaker greater than how impossibly annoying their completely loving and totally wonderful best friends could be.\u00a0</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t as though, once she had slowed her heart rate, that Jon was so difficult to talk to or anything. He wasn\u2019t much one for small talk, but there was no need for small talk between them. She had always seemed to confide in him, all apart from one topic of course, because he was such a good listener. He <i>really </i>listened, thoughtfully, always nodding and never interrupting. He\u2019d ask questions that made you <i>know </i>he was really thinking about what you were saying.\u00a0</p><p>Even still he smelled so good and he looked so good and he was sitting so very close to her that she was afraid if she didn\u2019t have something to do with her hands she might just removed his hair from it\u2019s bun and run her fingers through it.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this red wine here that I really like actually,&rdquo; Jon said, as though reading her mind. &ldquo;If you wanted to split a bottle? Though if you&rsquo;d prefer a lemon drop martini I can get something else&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She told herself that it didn\u2019t matter that he knew her favorite drink. If he was sitting with Arya or Robb or Ella he\u2019d know what all of their favorite drinks were too. He just knew everything about her, the way you did with the people you knew your entire life.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything, but she blushed all the same.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Wine sounds good,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;Which bottle is it?&rdquo;</p><p>She picked up the wine list and because they were on a corner, it was very easy for him to lean in next to her. He really did smell so good and he&rsquo;d trimmed his beard for tonight and she had the ridiculous urge to lick his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;Ella even <i>told </i>me it before I came&hellip; um&hellip;,&rdquo; he said scanning over the list.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; a voice said from above them and they looked to find a waiter proffering a bottle. &ldquo;A bottle of The Wight 74, with compliments&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that-,&rdquo; she started.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jon confirmed with his eyes closed.</p><p>Sansa had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. He was so adorable when he was annoyed.</p><p>She remembered her thirteenth birthday. She had been upset when it had been Joffrey who she\u2019d ended up kissing and had gone outside to get some fresh air and found him there. He was snippy with her and she\u2019d gotten angry and then as though he couldn\u2019t help it he just grabbed a small box out of his pocket and shoved it at her. It had been a necklace with a dragonfly on it and he\u2019d been so surprised when she wanted to put it on immediately. She still had it and was surprised Ella hadn\u2019t recommended she wear it.</p><p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be compliments of an Ella Stark, would it?,&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>The waiter smiled and, as though he&rsquo;d been anticipating that question, said, &ldquo;The party has asked to remain nameless to protect your unborn godchild.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unbo-,&rdquo; Jon said and then looked at her.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes as she looked back. She knew that Ella and Robb had been trying for a few months but Robb hadn&rsquo;t said anything when she&rsquo;d seen him earlier.</p><p>She started to laugh and so did Jon. There were tears in his eyes and she wiped the ones running down her cheeks. He pulled her to him and she sank into his embrace and she squealed and they both laughed.\u00a0</p><p>It was so wonderful to hear this news with <i>him </i>of all people who would love the baby just as much as her. It felt so right to be with him and it reminded her how no matter what, they would always be inextricably linked.</p><p>Just like Ella intended.</p><p>\u201cMay I?,\u201d the waiter asked.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten he was there and she nodded, easing reluctantly out of Jon\u2019s embrace.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter set about uncorking it and she couldn\u2019t take it, she threw her arms around Jon\u2019s neck, wiggling all the while.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI get to be Auntie Sansa!,\u201d she giggled. <i>Another little Stark to love</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUncle Jon,\u201d he mused, cupping the back of her head and pressing a kiss to her hair.\u00a0</p><p>He was going to be a wonderful uncle, of that she was sure. If the baby was a boy, he\u2019d want to be just like his Uncle Jon - brave and gentle and strong - and if the baby was a little girl, he\u2019d treat her like a princess, the way he\u2019d always treated Ella.\u00a0</p><p>The way he\u2019d always treated her.\u00a0</p><p>Their waiter poured them a glass each and made himself scarce.\u00a0</p><p>Jon picked up his and held it to her, \u201cTo our niece or nephew,\u201d he said and she raised hers as well, \u201cAnd their meddlesome parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, Uncle Jon,\u201d she said with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAuntie Sansa,\u201d he said with a small shake of his head, his eyes on hers as their glasses touched.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGood work little one,\u201d Robb said, kissing her stomach.\u00a0</p><p>She stroked his rich auburn curls and sighed happily.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned his cheek upon her stomach now, they were splayed out on their big bed, the baby making her tired already.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me what happens next,\u201d he said, as though this were a bedtime story that she\u2019d soon tell their child.\u00a0</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about the two people they loved the most and said with a lazy smile, \u201cNext, Sansa will get giggly and Jon will get horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla!,\u201d Robb complained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou asked\u2026,\u201d she reminded him.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my god,\u201d </i>she moaned and Jon made sure his napkin was well and truly covering his lap.\u00a0</p><p>The brussel sprouts had finally arrived along with tuna tartare and freshly baked bread. Everything was delicious, including the wine, and Sansa was very appreciative.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously Jon,\u201d she said, stabbing a sprout gently with her fork and raising it towards him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try this.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the bite and fought the urge to moan himself, chewing it and nodding at her.\u00a0</p><p>She giggled and raised her thumb to his lips, swiping across and gathering some excess sauce and bringing it to her own mouth.</p><p>She looked at him like she couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that and he knew that he was looking at her like he too couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that. More than anything though, he knew he was looking at her like he very much wanted her to do it again.\u00a0</p><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t mind if next time she just kissed it off of him. In fact he\u2019d go back into the kitchens right now and get a whole bottle of that sauce just so she could lick it off of him if that\u2019s what she wanted.\u00a0</p><p>He shook himself out of it and raised his glass to his lips again. The wine wasn\u2019t helping, it was a <i>heady </i>wine and it was making Sansa\u2019s already perfect features all the more alluring. It was also making her more at ease, and when Sansa was at ease she was <i>touchy</i>. Which was exactly as wonderful and terrible as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cSo why?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?,\u201d he repeated dumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think they did this?,\u201d she clarified.\u00a0</p><p><i>Maybe because I am hopelessly in love with you and they are completely aware of it.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBoredom?,\u201d he offered instead, earning that giggle once again.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cOkay but this has been happening for <i>years</i>,\u201d Robb reminded her, \u201cI mean he has been in love with her for over a decade at least. She\u2019s been in love with him for just as long. How many millions of opportunities have they had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d she agreed and then smiled, \u201cBut that\u2019s when the table does it\u2019s magic\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It was on the second bottle of wine that the banquette seemed to get smaller. Or perhaps the restaurant just got louder.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, she and Jon got closer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d she told him as the waiter handed them their dessert menus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said with a grin, giving it a once over, and looking up at the waiter, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have one of the lemon tarts, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trouble, Jon Snow,\u201d she said, taking another sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Theon\u2019s theory on that phrase\u2026,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Their plates had been cleared and he now rested one forearm on the table, and the other on the back of the banquette. She had found her way into the hollow of his arms and her legs were crossed towards him and their calves were touching and had been for some time.\u00a0</p><p>She blushed because she <i>did </i>know, but she traced the rim of her wine glass with her index finger and played dumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTheon has so many theories\u2026,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can remember them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d he told her, and his voice was low when he added, \u201cBut this one just got suddenly more interesting.\u201d</p><p>He was playing with her, she was sure of it. Even still she liked that quality to his voice and even though she didn\u2019t know the rules quite yet she began to like this game.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d she said, looking up at him through lowered lashes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 that\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tips of his ears had turned pink and his eyes were threatening to bug out of his head and she knew that he knew they were in uncharted territory.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI remember now,\u201d she said and took a small sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled sheepishly and said, \u201cSome of his theories are dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she agreed, <i>but not this one</i>.\u00a0</p><p>He looked at her like he\u2019d heard her say it. Like she\u2019d shouted it at him. His eyes were trailing over her face like he was trying to see all of her at once and she realised in that moment that it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d looked at her like that.\u00a0</p><p>She knew that Ella and Robb knew about her feelings for Jon. That was, after all, why they\u2019d set this whole thing up.\u00a0</p><p>But she thought about Ella and Robb, the two people who loved her and knew her best in the world, and she thought that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have done this if they didn\u2019t at least <i>think </i>he might feel the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked him again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cThe more you talk about this, the more it kind of sounds like you are intending for them to end up in one of the restaurant bathrooms\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a shudder.</p><p>She giggled and shook her head, \u201cNot their style. You\u2026 on the other hand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one time,\u201d he reasoned with her, his hand snaking up her stomach, over her breast, tracing her neck until he could cup her face, \u201cAnd it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?,\u201d she asked him stubbornly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were you,\u201d he told her sweetly, \u201cWhen a guy like me is sitting next to the girl of his dreams and she, against all reason or sense, loves him back, there\u2019s only one thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>***</p><p>It was now or never.\u00a0</p><p>He had realised halfway through the first bottle of wine that Robb and Ella, the two most caring friends in the world, would never have put him in this situation if they didn\u2019t at least have an <i>inkling </i>that Sansa may, or at least could, feel the way for him that he felt for her.\u00a0</p><p>He started to think so too during the second bottle of wine and she was so charming and lovely that he couldn\u2019t help but move closer to her.\u00a0</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seemed to mind that and so he\u2019d gotten closer still, because it was the only thing to do when a girl like her let you.\u00a0</p><p>And then she\u2019d said it. <i>You\u2019re trouble Jon Snow.\u00a0</i></p><p>According to Theon, when a girl said that it meant she\u2019d already pictured sleeping with you. He usually disregarded Theon\u2019s theories as utter crap, but this one\u2026 he would sorely like this one to be right.\u00a0</p><p>She was looking at him like it maybe was right and he panicked and backtracked but she hadn\u2019t. Sansa Stark was many things but a coward wasn\u2019t one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought you deserved better than what you\u2019ve gotten,\u201d he told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t cockiness that made him say it. There was no pride in being better than her exes.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know it is,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that for you to know it to be true?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been there through every relationship. The tears and the betrayals, the cheating, even the one <i>hitting</i>. He\u2019d seen it all and he always told her that she deserved better, that she deserved to be cherished and treated like the angel that she was.\u00a0</p><p>She never believed him though, maybe because he\u2019d never shown her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s you they were looking out for,\u201d she mused, \u201cAfter Ygritte and Val\u2026 maybe they thought you needed someone more\u2026\u201d</p><p>She trailed off as though she couldn\u2019t think of any way that she was better than the girls he\u2019d dated before. As though she wasn\u2019t miles ahead of any other girl that could possibly have come before. As though she wasn\u2019t the human embodiment of perfection.</p><p>\u201cKind?,\u201d he asked her, \u201cThoughtful? Lovely in every conceivable way\u2026?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with her wide blue eyes, a delicious blush rising on her cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>He lifted his arm that had been resting on the banquette and took his hand and brushed some silky hair off of her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she said and he stopped as though cold water had been splashed on him.\u00a0</p><p>He had been about to lean in, but he must have been imagining it. He must have misread it. Of course he had. How could a girl like her ever want <i>him</i>?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d he managed to ask.\u00a0</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and asked, \u201cDo you remember my thirteenth birthday party?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo just like that, huh?,\u201d Robb asked. \u201cAfter years of wanting one another, they\u2019ll just give in, all because of a booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because of a booth,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cBecause they know <i>us</i>. When they stop doubting themselves they\u2019ll realise that we would never do this unless we knew they were both all in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you a decade ago?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight here, by their side,\u201d she said, \u201cHoping they\u2019d stop being idiots long enough to see the most obvious truth of them all.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>She was an idiot and she\u2019d ruined it.\u00a0</p><p>He had been looking at her like he might kiss her and then she\u2019d just <i>ruined </i>it.\u00a0</p><p>Jon placed his arm back on the banquette and moved the other to reach for the bottle of wine. He poured the last drops into her glass and his and then looked at her.\u00a0</p><p>He went to set it back down on the table, but instead of putting it standing upright he\u2019d laid it on it\u2019s side and turned it, definitively, and beautifully, towards her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twelve years too late,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd my palms are still sweaty but I love you even more now than I did then. <i>Happy birthday, Sansa Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>And just like that he kissed her. He kissed her and she was thirteen again. Nothing bad had ever happened to her. She had never been cheated on, no boy had ever yelled at her, there was certainly no boy who had ever hit her. He kissed her and it was like she was pure and unsullied once again.\u00a0</p><p>And he loved her.\u00a0</p><p>She kissed him back, because she loved him too. She\u2019d loved him at her boy-girl party and during every relationship that followed. She\u2019d loved him at Robb and Ella\u2019s wedding when he\u2019d walked right over to her while she was standing with Ramsay. They\u2019d been fighting about something because he was <i>ruining </i>what was meant to be a wonderful day and Jon had taken her hand, and said, \u201cSorry mate, it\u2019s tradition,\u201d because he\u2019d been the best man and she\u2019d been the maid of honor but he hadn\u2019t <i>seemed </i>sorry at all.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d held her so gently and said, \u201c<i>Why are you doing this to yourself again, Dovey?</i>\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d said, \u201c<i>I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Just dance with me a bit longer, won\u2019t you?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ll dance with you all night,</i>\u201d he promised, \u201c<i>If it keeps you out of his reach.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d she broke away and his eyes were as black as midnight and he moved to get away from her but she held him close, close enough that no one else could reach her. \u201cIf it\u2019s not forever. I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been always,\u201d he told her, \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be forever too. Just love me back, Dovey, because you own me. I\u2019ll love you either way but it\u2019ll make forever so much better if you <i>just</i> love me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had much choice when it comes to loving you,\u201d she confessed, \u201cNo choice at all. I just do. I always have and I always will. I love you <i>Jon Elliot Snow.</i>\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and she was no longer thirteen, she was twenty five, and though it might have been twelve years too late, it was all the sweeter knowing that she\u2019d never have to live without it again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>They must have fallen asleep before she finished the story, because it was light outside when her eyes opened.\u00a0</p><p>She was alone in bed, well Grey Wind was there but Robb was gone, and she rose and brushed her teeth, slipping on her slippers before padding into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorning sweetheart,\u201d Robb said from the stove where he was making pancakes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?,\u201d she asked, pressing a kiss to his shoulder blade on her way to get a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten,\u201d he said and she heard his grin when he said, \u201cMom thinks that means it\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only told his parents so far. Well, now Jon and Sansa knew too but no one else. She got emotional every time she thought about her goodparents\u2019 reaction to the news and she went and hugged him from behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>She knew he wanted a boy. He wanted many children but he wanted a boy first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen our daughter will be another beauty, just like her mother, and I will love her more than life itself, just like I do her mother,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She turned him around and stood on her tiptoes so that she could kiss him. She loved him so madly, and the way he loved her was her favorite thing about herself.\u00a0</p><p>It was the only reason why she\u2019d done what she did, so that Jon and Sansa could know the happiness that she and Robb had been lucky to have for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should call them?,\u201d she asked with a hopeful smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were wrong?,\u201d he asked her. She fixed him with a look and he grinned, \u201cLet\u2019s call Sansa first.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialled the familiar number. She answered after two rings.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d Sansa squealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d they yelled back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Auntie Sansa?,\u201d she asked, \u201cCan we count on you as godmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can!,\u201d Sansa giggled, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hug you both, right after I MURDER you!\u201d</p><p>Ella felt fear for the first time in this whole thing and she said slowly, \u201cDid\u2026 did it not go well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon they want to know how our date went,\u201d she heard Sansa say and Ella screamed bloody murder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly,\u201d Jon said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cBy the gods,\u201d Robb grumbled as she jumped up and down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly is it?,\u201d Sansa asked flirtatiously and she could practically see her pout.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jon said with a smile in his voice, \u201cThink I\u2019ll have to take you out again tonight just to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to dinner at our place,\u201d Ella offered, \u201cWe can celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby or relationship?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth, everything! I don\u2019t care just will you come over tonight please? You\u2019ll forgive me for meddling, won\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou?,\u201d Sansa scoffed, \u201cWe had this pegged as being all Robb\u2019s idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally someone recognises my genius,\u201d Robb said as though long suffering.\u00a0</p><p>They all said their goodbyes and hung up with promises of dinner later and she hopped up on the counter as Robb handed her a plate of pancakes and a fork.\u00a0</p><p>She hummed to herself as she bit into one and he ate his own with a small smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already planning their wedding, aren\u2019t you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in June,\u201d she nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s Sansa\u2019s favorite month\u2026 you\u2019ll wear a kilt. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla\u2026,\u201d he warned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just want Sansa to be loved the way you love me. And I want Jon to be loved the way I love you. Is that so terrible?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cLike everything about you, that is absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou know Ella will have us married off come Winter, don\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked Jon as he pulled her to his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d he said, his fingers trailing her naked back, \u201cThough I thought you\u2019d want to get married in June.\u201d</p><p><strike>\u201c</strike>What makes you say that?,\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite month,\u201d he reminded her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2026,\u201d she trailed off, not wanting to ruin the perfection of the evening and the morning by saying anything stupid.</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant,\u201d he said, tilting her chin up so she had to look at him, \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll marry you any month, any day, any hour that you want. I\u2019ll marry you in front of 500 people or in a court house with just Robb and Ella as witnesses. What did you think I meant by forever, Sansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune sounds good,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cWhat will we do until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said with a devilish grin, rolling them over so he was on top of her, \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she mused, as he kissed down her neck to her breasts, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of somethings\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her and grinned roguishly, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p>",

Robb &amp; Ella being absolutely determined to get their best friends to date bc it\u2019s so damn obvious to everyone else &amp; finally get them each to go on a blind date but it\u2019s with eachother?? idk if that\u2019s any good and again only if it inspires you oh my gosh<br></p><p>As a PSA to all: I love prompts! Please send along.</p><p><br></p><p>**</p><p>Jon walked into <i>Last Hearth</i>, one of those New-Westerosi restaurants obsessed with brussel sprouts and truffle oil, at three minutes to 8 o\u2019clock on Friday night.\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much for these kinds of restaurants, preferring to eat at home or at Winterfell, but of all of them, this was admittedly his favorite.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOkay just remember you like The Wight vintage 74 and the meatloaf,\u201d Ella said to him as he pulled on the charcoal sweater she\u2019d insisted he wear.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cElla I can order for myself!,\u201d he growled, annoyed by how much more comfortable he felt in the sweater she\u2019d suggested than the button down he\u2019d intended to wear. \u201cJust like I can find my own dates!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you were better at finding your own dates we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation, now would we?,\u201d she asked with a skeptical raise of her brow. Her face softened, \u201cAnd I know you are perfectly capable of deciding what to eat and drink and everything else\u2026 I just want you to be happy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you do, Ella,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ella was always well-intentioned. It was frustrating. Not as frustrating as her always being right though.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow is this really necessary?,\u201d he asked, holding up the flower she\u2019d given him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cA winter rose. She\u2019ll have one too.\u201d</i></p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t quite believe that he\u2019d agreed to a blind date. He had never been on one before, and quite honestly, they had always been his nightmare. He wasn\u2019t really one for small talk and that was all a blind date could be.\u00a0</p><p>Plus the uncertainty of it all. At least with a regular first date you know the girl found you <i>mildly </i>appealing. This was a total shot in the dark.\u00a0</p><p>He gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d. That was all a part of it, Ella loved suspense.\u00a0</p><p>He was ushered over to a table in the corner. He knew it must be coveted, two corners of it were on a banquette, which Ella had told him long ago made things more <i>romantic. </i>According to her, Robb would always whisper sweet things in her ear over dessert, though according to Robb, they were usually utterly filthy.\u00a0</p><p>He sat down and waited, setting the blue rose onto the table in front of him. He wanted a glass of whiskey, but he knew that wouldn\u2019t exactly make the best impression on his date and he had been assured by both Robb and Ella that she was worth making a good impression on her.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s stunning,\u201d Ella said.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd so sweet,\u201d Robb confirmed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll adore her,\u201d Ella promised.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI bet by the end of dinner you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d Robb offered.\u00a0</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Jon highly doubted it, even though he usually trusted Robb and Ella implicitly.\u00a0</p><p>He turned towards the door and saw a slender figure in a navy blue dress being escorted right towards him. He saw the rose before anything else and then his eyes landed on the most beautiful face he\u2019d ever seen.\u00a0</p><p>He stood up, his throat was dry and he really wished he\u2019d given in and had that whiskey.\u00a0</p><p>She looked at him questioningly, as though she didn\u2019t understand why the maitre\u2019d was bringing her towards him, so he reached on the table and picked up the winter rose, waving it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Realisation dawned in her eyes and he looked away from them in case disappointment came to rest there. He wasn\u2019t sure that he could take it if he did.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon Snow,\u201d she said by way of greeting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he offered in return.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d </i>Robb had said. Robb his hilarious and completely dead best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Oh he\u2019d known her for years, ever since he\u2019d met Robb in pre-school and she\u2019d been gurgling happily in her bouncy seat. He\u2019d known her for all but one of her twenty five years.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been in love with her for at least twelve of them.</p><p>***</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe that she\u2019d allowed Robb to talk her into this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d caught her of guard last week by asking. In all her life, she had never known her big brother to encourage her to date. He wanted her to be happy, she knew, but if that happiness could be achieved by spending all of her time safe with him and Ella and their family then more the better.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you want to set me up with someone,\u201d she scoffed, \u201cAren\u2019t you the same man who has threatened every one of my last four boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Robb nodded, stuffing his face with the lemon bars she\u2019d made for the whole family. The plate was now halfway gone. \u201cBut that\u2019s because they were assholes who didn\u2019t deserve you. At least this way, I know he\u2019s a good guy. He doesn\u2019t deserve you - no one could - but he won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she whined.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was so good, and so caring, it was obnoxious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever have, never will,\u201d he grinned,\u201cCome on Dovey. Give happiness just one more chance.\u201d</i></p><p>So it was that at 8 o\u2019clock on the dot she walked into Last Hearth, her favorite restaurant in the city (they had the yummiest brussel sprouts).\u00a0</p><p>She smoothed down the dress Robb had suggested, though she suspected that came from Ella. It was navy blue and silk and she was pleased that other patrons were dressed similarly. It was a great tragedy that no one seemed to dress up anymore and she wouldn\u2019t want her date to think she\u2019d been <i>so </i>eager to please.\u00a0</p><p>She gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d and he nodded at her and escorted her through the dining room.</p><p>She fiddled with the Winter Rose she held in her hand nervously and looked around.\u00a0</p><p>Then, to her utter dismay, she saw Jon Snow of all people sitting at the corner table.</p><p><i>Why does he have to be here? Couldn\u2019t the gods have at least given whatever poor bastard has been set up with me a chance? How am I supposed to care about them when Jon Elliot Snow is sitting a few tables away?</i></p><p>Jon stood up when he saw her and she was about to say to the maitre\u2019d that she was just going to greet a friend quickly when he waved something at her. A single Winter Rose.\u00a0</p><p>She tried to keep her face placid, though she searched his for signs of disappointment. He averted her gaze and her stomach plummetted. Of course, he had thought tonight was a date, a real date with a girl he might really be interested in. She wondered briefly if he had thought that he was going to get laid tonight and blushed at the thought.\u00a0</p><p>The maitre\u2019d stood in front of Jon with a flourish as though this was a great unveiling and she mustered all of her strength to greet him with a calm, \u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he said in that velvet voice that always made her name sound like a caress.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour waiter will be with you in a moment,\u201d the maitre\u2019d said and took his leave.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 I assume that Winter Rose isn\u2019t a coincidence?,\u201d Jon asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to pretend that it was?,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u00a0</p><p>He blanched and she regretted it instantly but he recovered quickly, a small smile whispering in the corner of his eyes, \u201cOf course not. You look beautiful, Dovey,\u201d he said kissing her cheek, \u201cLike always.\u201d</p><p>He had always been kind, unfailingly so, and he\u2019d been calling her beautiful since before she knew that not everyone in the world was. It didn\u2019t <i>mean </i>anything, she knew that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell you certainly clean up nice,\u201d she said back, \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose that color over the blue.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing the sweater she\u2019d bought him for his birthday last year. Another detail to thank Ella for she was sure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he nodded, the tips of his ears turning pink, \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite\u2026 should we um\u2026?,\u201d he asked gesturing to the banquette.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d she nodded and they sat down.\u00a0</p><p>They were seated at the corner table, the most romantic one in the restaurant, and according to Northern Times, the most romantic one in the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026,\u201d she said, suddenly completely incapable of thinking of anything interesting to say.\u00a0</p><p>Love had a way of making a smart girl stupid.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cDo you really think this will work?,\u201d Robb asked her.</p><p>Ella rolled her eyes, \u201cAre you starting to doubt me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, pulling her to him, \u201cI just know how stubborn they are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why our intervention was necessary,\u201d she reasoned, running her hands over his sweater-clad chest. She wrapped her arms around him and laid her cheek over his heart and went on, \u201cThe good news is that they are as predictable as they are stubborn. In fact, I can tell you exactly how it\u2019s going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?,\u201d he asked with a grin, \u201cGo on then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst\u2026 they are going to to act as though they are angry with us because neither of them realises that the other one is just as head over heels for <i>them</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>kill </i>Robb and Ella,\u201d Jon grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a little unfair,\u201d she scoffed and his eyes widened. He opened his mouth to protest, to tell her that he didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way about her, but she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way Robb had the foresight to do this. Killing Ella will probably be sufficient.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ll forgive him, he knows not what he does.\u201d</p><p>She giggled wind chimes and then her face fell, \u201cDo you\u2026 Well\u2026 I mean\u2026 I\u2019d understand if you wanted to\u2026 I don\u2019t want to ruin your Friday evening\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Ruin. You\u2019re cute.</i></p><p>How many times had he imagined asking her out? No more than the number of times that he\u2019d chickened out.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d been mad about her at least since she was thirteen years old. Before then he hadn\u2019t quite <i>realised </i>why he always got sweaty around her and why her opinion seemed to matter so much.\u00a0</p><p>It had all changed on her thirteenth birthday. It was the first year she had a boy-girl party and he and Robb and Theon had all promised to attend. It was no skin off Robb\u2019s nose who had already been dating Ella for a year at that point, having realised much earlier (at the age of eight during a terrible thunderstorm) that she was his beloved. \u00a0</p><p>They played spin the bottle and Sansa had spun first, she being the birthday girl. He had somehow been next to Joffrey, Ella\u2019s horrible older brother, and the bottle had landed right in between them. It had been Joffrey who had taken the bottle and turned it towards himself before marching proudly over and planting a kiss on Sansa\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p><p>She had been beet red but his knuckles had been white he was so angry. He realised then that he wasn\u2019t just angry, he was <i>jealous</i>, and more than anything he was <i>upset</i> that it hadn\u2019t been him.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d pushed those feelings down, always coming up with some excuse or other not to pursue her. But now sitting next to her all of those excuses fell right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell um\u2026 we\u2019re both here, right?,\u201d he suggested, \u201cWe have to eat\u2026 and I know how much you love their kale or whatever green thing is most popular this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their <i>brussel sprouts </i>and they are <i>iconic </i>and <i>timeless</i>,<i>\u201d </i>she said haughtily.</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d he said, picking up his menu with a flourish and earning that giggle again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOkay, well that could last through dessert\u2026,\u201d Robb reasoned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Ella said with a smile, \u201cBecause then we bring out the trump card\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It became quite clear that in order for her to get through this date, alcohol would have to be involved.</p><p>They\u2019d at least made it through the initial awkwardness, there was no icebreaker greater than how impossibly annoying their completely loving and totally wonderful best friends could be.\u00a0</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t as though, once she had slowed her heart rate, that Jon was so difficult to talk to or anything. He wasn\u2019t much one for small talk, but there was no need for small talk between them. She had always seemed to confide in him, all apart from one topic of course, because he was such a good listener. He <i>really </i>listened, thoughtfully, always nodding and never interrupting. He\u2019d ask questions that made you <i>know </i>he was really thinking about what you were saying.\u00a0</p><p>Even still he smelled so good and he looked so good and he was sitting so very close to her that she was afraid if she didn\u2019t have something to do with her hands she might just removed his hair from it\u2019s bun and run her fingers through it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this red wine here that I really like actually,\u201d Jon said, as though reading her mind. \u201cIf you wanted to split a bottle? Though if you\u2019d prefer a lemon drop martini I can get something else\u2026\u201d</p><p>She told herself that it didn\u2019t matter that he knew her favorite drink. If he was sitting with Arya or Robb or Ella he\u2019d know what all of their favorite drinks were too. He just knew everything about her, the way you did with the people you knew your entire life.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything, but she blushed all the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWine sounds good,\u201d she nodded, \u201cWhich bottle is it?\u201d</p><p>She picked up the wine list and because they were on a corner, it was very easy for him to lean in next to her. He really did smell so good and he\u2019d trimmed his beard for tonight and she had the ridiculous urge to lick his neck.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026Ella even <i>told </i>me it before I came\u2026 um\u2026,\u201d he said scanning over the list.</p><p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d a voice said from above them and they looked to find a waiter proffering a bottle. \u201cA bottle of The Wight 74, with compliments\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that-,\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jon confirmed with his eyes closed.</p><p>Sansa had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. He was so adorable when he was annoyed.</p><p>She remembered her thirteenth birthday. She had been upset when it had been Joffrey who she\u2019d ended up kissing and had gone outside to get some fresh air and found him there. He was snippy with her and she\u2019d gotten angry and then as though he couldn\u2019t help it he just grabbed a small box out of his pocket and shoved it at her. It had been a necklace with a dragonfly on it and he\u2019d been so surprised when she wanted to put it on immediately. She still had it and was surprised Ella hadn\u2019t recommended she wear it.</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen to be compliments of an Ella Stark, would it?,\u201d she asked.</p><p>The waiter smiled and, as though he\u2019d been anticipating that question, said, \u201cThe party has asked to remain nameless to protect your unborn godchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbo-,\u201d Jon said and then looked at her.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes as she looked back. She knew that Ella and Robb had been trying for a few months but Robb hadn\u2019t said anything when she\u2019d seen him earlier.</p><p>She started to laugh and so did Jon. There were tears in his eyes and she wiped the ones running down her cheeks. He pulled her to him and she sank into his embrace and she squealed and they both laughed.\u00a0</p><p>It was so wonderful to hear this news with <i>him </i>of all people who would love the baby just as much as her. It felt so right to be with him and it reminded her how no matter what, they would always be inextricably linked.</p><p>Just like Ella intended.</p><p>\u201cMay I?,\u201d the waiter asked.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten he was there and she nodded, easing reluctantly out of Jon\u2019s embrace.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter set about uncorking it and she couldn\u2019t take it, she threw her arms around Jon\u2019s neck, wiggling all the while.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI get to be Auntie Sansa!,\u201d she giggled. <i>Another little Stark to love</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUncle Jon,\u201d he mused, cupping the back of her head and pressing a kiss to her hair.\u00a0</p><p>He was going to be a wonderful uncle, of that she was sure. If the baby was a boy, he\u2019d want to be just like his Uncle Jon - brave and gentle and strong - and if the baby was a little girl, he\u2019d treat her like a princess, the way he\u2019d always treated Ella.\u00a0</p><p>The way he\u2019d always treated her.\u00a0</p><p>Their waiter poured them a glass each and made himself scarce.\u00a0</p><p>Jon picked up his and held it to her, \u201cTo our niece or nephew,\u201d he said and she raised hers as well, \u201cAnd their meddlesome parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, Uncle Jon,\u201d she said with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAuntie Sansa,\u201d he said with a small shake of his head, his eyes on hers as their glasses touched.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGood work little one,\u201d Robb said, kissing her stomach.\u00a0</p><p>She stroked his rich auburn curls and sighed happily.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned his cheek upon her stomach now, they were splayed out on their big bed, the baby making her tired already.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me what happens next,\u201d he said, as though this were a bedtime story that she\u2019d soon tell their child.\u00a0</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about the two people they loved the most and said with a lazy smile, \u201cNext, Sansa will get giggly and Jon will get horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla!,\u201d Robb complained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou asked\u2026,\u201d she reminded him.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my god,\u201d </i>she moaned and Jon made sure his napkin was well and truly covering his lap.\u00a0</p><p>The brussel sprouts had finally arrived along with tuna tartare and freshly baked bread. Everything was delicious, including the wine, and Sansa was very appreciative.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously Jon,\u201d she said, stabbing a sprout gently with her fork and raising it towards him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try this.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the bite and fought the urge to moan himself, chewing it and nodding at her.\u00a0</p><p>She giggled and raised her thumb to his lips, swiping across and gathering some excess sauce and bringing it to her own mouth.</p><p>She looked at him like she couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that and he knew that he was looking at her like he too couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that. More than anything though, he knew he was looking at her like he very much wanted her to do it again.\u00a0</p><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t mind if next time she just kissed it off of him. In fact he\u2019d go back into the kitchens right now and get a whole bottle of that sauce just so she could lick it off of him if that\u2019s what she wanted.\u00a0</p><p>He shook himself out of it and raised his glass to his lips again. The wine wasn\u2019t helping, it was a <i>heady </i>wine and it was making Sansa\u2019s already perfect features all the more alluring. It was also making her more at ease, and when Sansa was at ease she was <i>touchy</i>. Which was exactly as wonderful and terrible as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cSo why?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?,\u201d he repeated dumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think they did this?,\u201d she clarified.\u00a0</p><p><i>Maybe because I am hopelessly in love with you and they are completely aware of it.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBoredom?,\u201d he offered instead, earning that giggle once again.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cOkay but this has been happening for <i>years</i>,\u201d Robb reminded her, \u201cI mean he has been in love with her for over a decade at least. She\u2019s been in love with him for just as long. How many millions of opportunities have they had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d she agreed and then smiled, \u201cBut that\u2019s when the table does it\u2019s magic\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It was on the second bottle of wine that the banquette seemed to get smaller. Or perhaps the restaurant just got louder.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, she and Jon got closer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d she told him as the waiter handed them their dessert menus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said with a grin, giving it a once over, and looking up at the waiter, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have one of the lemon tarts, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trouble, Jon Snow,\u201d she said, taking another sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Theon\u2019s theory on that phrase\u2026,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Their plates had been cleared and he now rested one forearm on the table, and the other on the back of the banquette. She had found her way into the hollow of his arms and her legs were crossed towards him and their calves were touching and had been for some time.\u00a0</p><p>She blushed because she <i>did </i>know, but she traced the rim of her wine glass with her index finger and played dumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTheon has so many theories\u2026,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can remember them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d he told her, and his voice was low when he added, \u201cBut this one just got suddenly more interesting.\u201d</p><p>He was playing with her, she was sure of it. Even still she liked that quality to his voice and even though she didn\u2019t know the rules quite yet she began to like this game.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d she said, looking up at him through lowered lashes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 that\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tips of his ears had turned pink and his eyes were threatening to bug out of his head and she knew that he knew they were in uncharted territory.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI remember now,\u201d she said and took a small sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled sheepishly and said, \u201cSome of his theories are dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she agreed, <i>but not this one</i>.\u00a0</p><p>He looked at her like he\u2019d heard her say it. Like she\u2019d shouted it at him. His eyes were trailing over her face like he was trying to see all of her at once and she realised in that moment that it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d looked at her like that.\u00a0</p><p>She knew that Ella and Robb knew about her feelings for Jon. That was, after all, why they\u2019d set this whole thing up.\u00a0</p><p>But she thought about Ella and Robb, the two people who loved her and knew her best in the world, and she thought that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have done this if they didn\u2019t at least <i>think </i>he might feel the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked him again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cThe more you talk about this, the more it kind of sounds like you are intending for them to end up in one of the restaurant bathrooms\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a shudder.</p><p>She giggled and shook her head, \u201cNot their style. You\u2026 on the other hand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one time,\u201d he reasoned with her, his hand snaking up her stomach, over her breast, tracing her neck until he could cup her face, \u201cAnd it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?,\u201d she asked him stubbornly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were you,\u201d he told her sweetly, \u201cWhen a guy like me is sitting next to the girl of his dreams and she, against all reason or sense, loves him back, there\u2019s only one thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>***</p><p>It was now or never.\u00a0</p><p>He had realised halfway through the first bottle of wine that Robb and Ella, the two most caring friends in the world, would never have put him in this situation if they didn\u2019t at least have an <i>inkling </i>that Sansa may, or at least could, feel the way for him that he felt for her.\u00a0</p><p>He started to think so too during the second bottle of wine and she was so charming and lovely that he couldn\u2019t help but move closer to her.\u00a0</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seemed to mind that and so he\u2019d gotten closer still, because it was the only thing to do when a girl like her let you.\u00a0</p><p>And then she\u2019d said it. <i>You\u2019re trouble Jon Snow.\u00a0</i></p><p>According to Theon, when a girl said that it meant she\u2019d already pictured sleeping with you. He usually disregarded Theon\u2019s theories as utter crap, but this one\u2026 he would sorely like this one to be right.\u00a0</p><p>She was looking at him like it maybe was right and he panicked and backtracked but she hadn\u2019t. Sansa Stark was many things but a coward wasn\u2019t one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought you deserved better than what you\u2019ve gotten,\u201d he told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t cockiness that made him say it. There was no pride in being better than her exes.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know it is,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that for you to know it to be true?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been there through every relationship. The tears and the betrayals, the cheating, even the one <i>hitting</i>. He\u2019d seen it all and he always told her that she deserved better, that she deserved to be cherished and treated like the angel that she was.\u00a0</p><p>She never believed him though, maybe because he\u2019d never shown her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s you they were looking out for,\u201d she mused, \u201cAfter Ygritte and Val\u2026 maybe they thought you needed someone more\u2026\u201d</p><p>She trailed off as though she couldn\u2019t think of any way that she was better than the girls he\u2019d dated before. As though she wasn\u2019t miles ahead of any other girl that could possibly have come before. As though she wasn\u2019t the human embodiment of perfection.</p><p>\u201cKind?,\u201d he asked her, \u201cThoughtful? Lovely in every conceivable way\u2026?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with her wide blue eyes, a delicious blush rising on her cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>He lifted his arm that had been resting on the banquette and took his hand and brushed some silky hair off of her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she said and he stopped as though cold water had been splashed on him.\u00a0</p><p>He had been about to lean in, but he must have been imagining it. He must have misread it. Of course he had. How could a girl like her ever want <i>him</i>?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d he managed to ask.\u00a0</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and asked, \u201cDo you remember my thirteenth birthday party?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo just like that, huh?,\u201d Robb asked. \u201cAfter years of wanting one another, they\u2019ll just give in, all because of a booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because of a booth,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cBecause they know <i>us</i>. When they stop doubting themselves they\u2019ll realise that we would never do this unless we knew they were both all in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you a decade ago?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight here, by their side,\u201d she said, \u201cHoping they\u2019d stop being idiots long enough to see the most obvious truth of them all.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>She was an idiot and she\u2019d ruined it.\u00a0</p><p>He had been looking at her like he might kiss her and then she\u2019d just <i>ruined </i>it.\u00a0</p><p>Jon placed his arm back on the banquette and moved the other to reach for the bottle of wine. He poured the last drops into her glass and his and then looked at her.\u00a0</p><p>He went to set it back down on the table, but instead of putting it standing upright he\u2019d laid it on it\u2019s side and turned it, definitively, and beautifully, towards her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twelve years too late,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd my palms are still sweaty but I love you even more now than I did then. <i>Happy birthday, Sansa Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>And just like that he kissed her. He kissed her and she was thirteen again. Nothing bad had ever happened to her. She had never been cheated on, no boy had ever yelled at her, there was certainly no boy who had ever hit her. He kissed her and it was like she was pure and unsullied once again.\u00a0</p><p>And he loved her.\u00a0</p><p>She kissed him back, because she loved him too. She\u2019d loved him at her boy-girl party and during every relationship that followed. She\u2019d loved him at Robb and Ella\u2019s wedding when he\u2019d walked right over to her while she was standing with Ramsay. They\u2019d been fighting about something because he was <i>ruining </i>what was meant to be a wonderful day and Jon had taken her hand, and said, \u201cSorry mate, it\u2019s tradition,\u201d because he\u2019d been the best man and she\u2019d been the maid of honor but he hadn\u2019t <i>seemed </i>sorry at all.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d held her so gently and said, \u201c<i>Why are you doing this to yourself again, Dovey?</i>\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d said, \u201c<i>I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Just dance with me a bit longer, won\u2019t you?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ll dance with you all night,</i>\u201d he promised, \u201c<i>If it keeps you out of his reach.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d she broke away and his eyes were as black as midnight and he moved to get away from her but she held him close, close enough that no one else could reach her. \u201cIf it\u2019s not forever. I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been always,\u201d he told her, \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be forever too. Just love me back, Dovey, because you own me. I\u2019ll love you either way but it\u2019ll make forever so much better if you <i>just</i> love me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had much choice when it comes to loving you,\u201d she confessed, \u201cNo choice at all. I just do. I always have and I always will. I love you <i>Jon Elliot Snow.</i>\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and she was no longer thirteen, she was twenty five, and though it might have been twelve years too late, it was all the sweeter knowing that she\u2019d never have to live without it again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>They must have fallen asleep before she finished the story, because it was light outside when her eyes opened.\u00a0</p><p>She was alone in bed, well Grey Wind was there but Robb was gone, and she rose and brushed her teeth, slipping on her slippers before padding into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorning sweetheart,\u201d Robb said from the stove where he was making pancakes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?,\u201d she asked, pressing a kiss to his shoulder blade on her way to get a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten,\u201d he said and she heard his grin when he said, \u201cMom thinks that means it\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only told his parents so far. Well, now Jon and Sansa knew too but no one else. She got emotional every time she thought about her goodparents\u2019 reaction to the news and she went and hugged him from behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>She knew he wanted a boy. He wanted many children but he wanted a boy first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen our daughter will be another beauty, just like her mother, and I will love her more than life itself, just like I do her mother,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She turned him around and stood on her tiptoes so that she could kiss him. She loved him so madly, and the way he loved her was her favorite thing about herself.\u00a0</p><p>It was the only reason why she\u2019d done what she did, so that Jon and Sansa could know the happiness that she and Robb had been lucky to have for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should call them?,\u201d she asked with a hopeful smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were wrong?,\u201d he asked her. She fixed him with a look and he grinned, \u201cLet\u2019s call Sansa first.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialled the familiar number. She answered after two rings.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d Sansa squealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d they yelled back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Auntie Sansa?,\u201d she asked, \u201cCan we count on you as godmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can!,\u201d Sansa giggled, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hug you both, right after I MURDER you!\u201d</p><p>Ella felt fear for the first time in this whole thing and she said slowly, \u201cDid\u2026 did it not go well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon they want to know how our date went,\u201d she heard Sansa say and Ella screamed bloody murder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly,\u201d Jon said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cBy the gods,\u201d Robb grumbled as she jumped up and down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly is it?,\u201d Sansa asked flirtatiously and she could practically see her pout.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jon said with a smile in his voice, \u201cThink I\u2019ll have to take you out again tonight just to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to dinner at our place,\u201d Ella offered, \u201cWe can celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby or relationship?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth, everything! I don\u2019t care just will you come over tonight please? You\u2019ll forgive me for meddling, won\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou?,\u201d Sansa scoffed, \u201cWe had this pegged as being all Robb\u2019s idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally someone recognises my genius,\u201d Robb said as though long suffering.\u00a0</p><p>They all said their goodbyes and hung up with promises of dinner later and she hopped up on the counter as Robb handed her a plate of pancakes and a fork.\u00a0</p><p>She hummed to herself as she bit into one and he ate his own with a small smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already planning their wedding, aren\u2019t you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in June,\u201d she nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s Sansa\u2019s favorite month\u2026 you\u2019ll wear a kilt. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla\u2026,\u201d he warned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just want Sansa to be loved the way you love me. And I want Jon to be loved the way I love you. Is that so terrible?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cLike everything about you, that is absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou know Ella will have us married off come Winter, don\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked Jon as he pulled her to his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d he said, his fingers trailing her naked back, \u201cThough I thought you\u2019d want to get married in June.\u201d</p><p><strike>\u201c</strike>What makes you say that?,\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite month,\u201d he reminded her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2026,\u201d she trailed off, not wanting to ruin the perfection of the evening and the morning by saying anything stupid.</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant,\u201d he said, tilting her chin up so she had to look at him, \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll marry you any month, any day, any hour that you want. I\u2019ll marry you in front of 500 people or in a court house with just Robb and Ella as witnesses. What did you think I meant by forever, Sansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune sounds good,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cWhat will we do until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said with a devilish grin, rolling them over so he was on top of her, \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she mused, as he kissed down her neck to her breasts, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of somethings\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her and grinned roguishly, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p>",

Please send along.</p><p><br></p><p>**</p><p>Jon walked into <i>Last Hearth</i>, one of those New-Westerosi restaurants obsessed with brussel sprouts and truffle oil, at three minutes to 8 o\u2019clock on Friday night.\u00a0</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much for these kinds of restaurants, preferring to eat at home or at Winterfell, but of all of them, this was admittedly his favorite.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cOkay just remember you like The Wight vintage 74 and the meatloaf,\u201d Ella said to him as he pulled on the charcoal sweater she\u2019d insisted he wear.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cElla I can order for myself!,\u201d he growled, annoyed by how much more comfortable he felt in the sweater she\u2019d suggested than the button down he\u2019d intended to wear. \u201cJust like I can find my own dates!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf you were better at finding your own dates we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation, now would we?,\u201d she asked with a skeptical raise of her brow. Her face softened, \u201cAnd I know you are perfectly capable of deciding what to eat and drink and everything else\u2026 I just want you to be happy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cI know you do, Ella,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>Ella was always well-intentioned. It was frustrating. Not as frustrating as her always being right though.</i></p><p><i>\u201cNow is this really necessary?,\u201d he asked, holding up the flower she\u2019d given him.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cA winter rose. She\u2019ll have one too.\u201d</i></p><p>Jon couldn\u2019t quite believe that he\u2019d agreed to a blind date. He had never been on one before, and quite honestly, they had always been his nightmare. He wasn\u2019t really one for small talk and that was all a blind date could be.\u00a0</p><p>Plus the uncertainty of it all. At least with a regular first date you know the girl found you <i>mildly </i>appealing. This was a total shot in the dark.\u00a0</p><p>He gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d. That was all a part of it, Ella loved suspense.\u00a0</p><p>He was ushered over to a table in the corner. He knew it must be coveted, two corners of it were on a banquette, which Ella had told him long ago made things more <i>romantic. </i>According to her, Robb would always whisper sweet things in her ear over dessert, though according to Robb, they were usually utterly filthy.\u00a0</p><p>He sat down and waited, setting the blue rose onto the table in front of him. He wanted a glass of whiskey, but he knew that wouldn\u2019t exactly make the best impression on his date and he had been assured by both Robb and Ella that she was worth making a good impression on her.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cShe\u2019s stunning,\u201d Ella said.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd so sweet,\u201d Robb confirmed.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll adore her,\u201d Ella promised.</i></p><p><i>\u201cI bet by the end of dinner you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d Robb offered.\u00a0</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>Jon highly doubted it, even though he usually trusted Robb and Ella implicitly.\u00a0</p><p>He turned towards the door and saw a slender figure in a navy blue dress being escorted right towards him. He saw the rose before anything else and then his eyes landed on the most beautiful face he\u2019d ever seen.\u00a0</p><p>He stood up, his throat was dry and he really wished he\u2019d given in and had that whiskey.\u00a0</p><p>She looked at him questioningly, as though she didn\u2019t understand why the maitre\u2019d was bringing her towards him, so he reached on the table and picked up the winter rose, waving it slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Realisation dawned in her eyes and he looked away from them in case disappointment came to rest there. He wasn\u2019t sure that he could take it if he did.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJon Snow,\u201d she said by way of greeting.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he offered in return.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve known her for years,\u201d </i>Robb had said. Robb his hilarious and completely dead best friend.\u00a0</p><p>Oh he\u2019d known her for years, ever since he\u2019d met Robb in pre-school and she\u2019d been gurgling happily in her bouncy seat. He\u2019d known her for all but one of her twenty five years.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d been in love with her for at least twelve of them.</p><p>***</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite believe that she\u2019d allowed Robb to talk her into this.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d caught her of guard last week by asking. In all her life, she had never known her big brother to encourage her to date. He wanted her to be happy, she knew, but if that happiness could be achieved by spending all of her time safe with him and Ella and their family then more the better.\u00a0</p><p><i>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you want to set me up with someone,\u201d she scoffed, \u201cAren\u2019t you the same man who has threatened every one of my last four boyfriends?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d Robb nodded, stuffing his face with the lemon bars she\u2019d made for the whole family. The plate was now halfway gone. \u201cBut that\u2019s because they were assholes who didn\u2019t deserve you. At least this way, I know he\u2019s a good guy. He doesn\u2019t deserve you - no one could - but he won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re not playing fair,\u201d she whined.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He was so good, and so caring, it was obnoxious.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>\u201cNever have, never will,\u201d he grinned,\u201cCome on Dovey. Give happiness just one more chance.\u201d</i></p><p>So it was that at 8 o\u2019clock on the dot she walked into Last Hearth, her favorite restaurant in the city (they had the yummiest brussel sprouts).\u00a0</p><p>She smoothed down the dress Robb had suggested, though she suspected that came from Ella. It was navy blue and silk and she was pleased that other patrons were dressed similarly. It was a great tragedy that no one seemed to dress up anymore and she wouldn\u2019t want her date to think she\u2019d been <i>so </i>eager to please.\u00a0</p><p>She gave Robb\u2019s name to the maitre\u2019d and he nodded at her and escorted her through the dining room.</p><p>She fiddled with the Winter Rose she held in her hand nervously and looked around.\u00a0</p><p>Then, to her utter dismay, she saw Jon Snow of all people sitting at the corner table.</p><p><i>Why does he have to be here? Couldn\u2019t the gods have at least given whatever poor bastard has been set up with me a chance? How am I supposed to care about them when Jon Elliot Snow is sitting a few tables away?</i></p><p>Jon stood up when he saw her and she was about to say to the maitre\u2019d that she was just going to greet a friend quickly when he waved something at her. A single Winter Rose.\u00a0</p><p>She tried to keep her face placid, though she searched his for signs of disappointment. He averted her gaze and her stomach plummetted. Of course, he had thought tonight was a date, a real date with a girl he might really be interested in. She wondered briefly if he had thought that he was going to get laid tonight and blushed at the thought.\u00a0</p><p>The maitre\u2019d stood in front of Jon with a flourish as though this was a great unveiling and she mustered all of her strength to greet him with a calm, \u201cJon Snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa Stark,\u201d he said in that velvet voice that always made her name sound like a caress.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYour waiter will be with you in a moment,\u201d the maitre\u2019d said and took his leave.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 I assume that Winter Rose isn\u2019t a coincidence?,\u201d Jon asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to pretend that it was?,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u00a0</p><p>He blanched and she regretted it instantly but he recovered quickly, a small smile whispering in the corner of his eyes, \u201cOf course not. You look beautiful, Dovey,\u201d he said kissing her cheek, \u201cLike always.\u201d</p><p>He had always been kind, unfailingly so, and he\u2019d been calling her beautiful since before she knew that not everyone in the world was. It didn\u2019t <i>mean </i>anything, she knew that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell you certainly clean up nice,\u201d she said back, \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose that color over the blue.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing the sweater she\u2019d bought him for his birthday last year. Another detail to thank Ella for she was sure.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he nodded, the tips of his ears turning pink, \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite\u2026 should we um\u2026?,\u201d he asked gesturing to the banquette.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d she nodded and they sat down.\u00a0</p><p>They were seated at the corner table, the most romantic one in the restaurant, and according to Northern Times, the most romantic one in the city.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026,\u201d she said, suddenly completely incapable of thinking of anything interesting to say.\u00a0</p><p>Love had a way of making a smart girl stupid.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cDo you really think this will work?,\u201d Robb asked her.</p><p>Ella rolled her eyes, \u201cAre you starting to doubt me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, pulling her to him, \u201cI just know how stubborn they are\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why our intervention was necessary,\u201d she reasoned, running her hands over his sweater-clad chest. She wrapped her arms around him and laid her cheek over his heart and went on, \u201cThe good news is that they are as predictable as they are stubborn. In fact, I can tell you exactly how it\u2019s going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?,\u201d he asked with a grin, \u201cGo on then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst\u2026 they are going to to act as though they are angry with us because neither of them realises that the other one is just as head over heels for <i>them</i>\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <i>kill </i>Robb and Ella,\u201d Jon grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a little unfair,\u201d she scoffed and his eyes widened. He opened his mouth to protest, to tell her that he didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way about her, but she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way Robb had the foresight to do this. Killing Ella will probably be sufficient.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ll forgive him, he knows not what he does.\u201d</p><p>She giggled wind chimes and then her face fell, \u201cDo you\u2026 Well\u2026 I mean\u2026 I\u2019d understand if you wanted to\u2026 I don\u2019t want to ruin your Friday evening\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>Ruin. You\u2019re cute.</i></p><p>How many times had he imagined asking her out? No more than the number of times that he\u2019d chickened out.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d been mad about her at least since she was thirteen years old. Before then he hadn\u2019t quite <i>realised </i>why he always got sweaty around her and why her opinion seemed to matter so much.\u00a0</p><p>It had all changed on her thirteenth birthday. It was the first year she had a boy-girl party and he and Robb and Theon had all promised to attend. It was no skin off Robb\u2019s nose who had already been dating Ella for a year at that point, having realised much earlier (at the age of eight during a terrible thunderstorm) that she was his beloved. \u00a0</p><p>They played spin the bottle and Sansa had spun first, she being the birthday girl. He had somehow been next to Joffrey, Ella\u2019s horrible older brother, and the bottle had landed right in between them. It had been Joffrey who had taken the bottle and turned it towards himself before marching proudly over and planting a kiss on Sansa\u2019s lips.\u00a0</p><p>She had been beet red but his knuckles had been white he was so angry. He realised then that he wasn\u2019t just angry, he was <i>jealous</i>, and more than anything he was <i>upset</i> that it hadn\u2019t been him.\u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d pushed those feelings down, always coming up with some excuse or other not to pursue her. But now sitting next to her all of those excuses fell right out of his head.</p><p>\u201cWell um\u2026 we\u2019re both here, right?,\u201d he suggested, \u201cWe have to eat\u2026 and I know how much you love their kale or whatever green thing is most popular this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their <i>brussel sprouts </i>and they are <i>iconic </i>and <i>timeless</i>,<i>\u201d </i>she said haughtily.</p><p>\u201cWell then,\u201d he said, picking up his menu with a flourish and earning that giggle again.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cOkay, well that could last through dessert\u2026,\u201d Robb reasoned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Ella said with a smile, \u201cBecause then we bring out the trump card\u2026\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>It became quite clear that in order for her to get through this date, alcohol would have to be involved.</p><p>They\u2019d at least made it through the initial awkwardness, there was no icebreaker greater than how impossibly annoying their completely loving and totally wonderful best friends could be.\u00a0</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t as though, once she had slowed her heart rate, that Jon was so difficult to talk to or anything. He wasn\u2019t much one for small talk, but there was no need for small talk between them. She had always seemed to confide in him, all apart from one topic of course, because he was such a good listener. He <i>really </i>listened, thoughtfully, always nodding and never interrupting. He\u2019d ask questions that made you <i>know </i>he was really thinking about what you were saying.\u00a0</p><p>Even still he smelled so good and he looked so good and he was sitting so very close to her that she was afraid if she didn\u2019t have something to do with her hands she might just removed his hair from it\u2019s bun and run her fingers through it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this red wine here that I really like actually,\u201d Jon said, as though reading her mind. \u201cIf you wanted to split a bottle? Though if you\u2019d prefer a lemon drop martini I can get something else\u2026\u201d</p><p>She told herself that it didn\u2019t matter that he knew her favorite drink. If he was sitting with Arya or Robb or Ella he\u2019d know what all of their favorite drinks were too. He just knew everything about her, the way you did with the people you knew your entire life.\u00a0</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything, but she blushed all the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWine sounds good,\u201d she nodded, \u201cWhich bottle is it?\u201d</p><p>She picked up the wine list and because they were on a corner, it was very easy for him to lean in next to her. He really did smell so good and he\u2019d trimmed his beard for tonight and she had the ridiculous urge to lick his neck.</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2026Ella even <i>told </i>me it before I came\u2026 um\u2026,\u201d he said scanning over the list.</p><p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d a voice said from above them and they looked to find a waiter proffering a bottle. \u201cA bottle of The Wight 74, with compliments\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that-,\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jon confirmed with his eyes closed.</p><p>Sansa had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. He was so adorable when he was annoyed.</p><p>She remembered her thirteenth birthday. She had been upset when it had been Joffrey who she\u2019d ended up kissing and had gone outside to get some fresh air and found him there. He was snippy with her and she\u2019d gotten angry and then as though he couldn\u2019t help it he just grabbed a small box out of his pocket and shoved it at her. It had been a necklace with a dragonfly on it and he\u2019d been so surprised when she wanted to put it on immediately. She still had it and was surprised Ella hadn\u2019t recommended she wear it.</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t happen to be compliments of an Ella Stark, would it?,\u201d she asked.</p><p>The waiter smiled and, as though he\u2019d been anticipating that question, said, \u201cThe party has asked to remain nameless to protect your unborn godchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbo-,\u201d Jon said and then looked at her.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes as she looked back. She knew that Ella and Robb had been trying for a few months but Robb hadn\u2019t said anything when she\u2019d seen him earlier.</p><p>She started to laugh and so did Jon. There were tears in his eyes and she wiped the ones running down her cheeks. He pulled her to him and she sank into his embrace and she squealed and they both laughed.\u00a0</p><p>It was so wonderful to hear this news with <i>him </i>of all people who would love the baby just as much as her. It felt so right to be with him and it reminded her how no matter what, they would always be inextricably linked.</p><p>Just like Ella intended.</p><p>\u201cMay I?,\u201d the waiter asked.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten he was there and she nodded, easing reluctantly out of Jon\u2019s embrace.\u00a0</p><p>The waiter set about uncorking it and she couldn\u2019t take it, she threw her arms around Jon\u2019s neck, wiggling all the while.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI get to be Auntie Sansa!,\u201d she giggled. <i>Another little Stark to love</i>.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUncle Jon,\u201d he mused, cupping the back of her head and pressing a kiss to her hair.\u00a0</p><p>He was going to be a wonderful uncle, of that she was sure. If the baby was a boy, he\u2019d want to be just like his Uncle Jon - brave and gentle and strong - and if the baby was a little girl, he\u2019d treat her like a princess, the way he\u2019d always treated Ella.\u00a0</p><p>The way he\u2019d always treated her.\u00a0</p><p>Their waiter poured them a glass each and made himself scarce.\u00a0</p><p>Jon picked up his and held it to her, \u201cTo our niece or nephew,\u201d he said and she raised hers as well, \u201cAnd their meddlesome parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you, Uncle Jon,\u201d she said with a smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAuntie Sansa,\u201d he said with a small shake of his head, his eyes on hers as their glasses touched.\u00a0</p><p>*</p><p>\u201cGood work little one,\u201d Robb said, kissing her stomach.\u00a0</p><p>She stroked his rich auburn curls and sighed happily.\u00a0</p><p>He leaned his cheek upon her stomach now, they were splayed out on their big bed, the baby making her tired already.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTell me what happens next,\u201d he said, as though this were a bedtime story that she\u2019d soon tell their child.\u00a0</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about the two people they loved the most and said with a lazy smile, \u201cNext, Sansa will get giggly and Jon will get horny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla!,\u201d Robb complained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou asked\u2026,\u201d she reminded him.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201c<i>Oh my god,\u201d </i>she moaned and Jon made sure his napkin was well and truly covering his lap.\u00a0</p><p>The brussel sprouts had finally arrived along with tuna tartare and freshly baked bread. Everything was delicious, including the wine, and Sansa was very appreciative.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously Jon,\u201d she said, stabbing a sprout gently with her fork and raising it towards him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try this.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the bite and fought the urge to moan himself, chewing it and nodding at her.\u00a0</p><p>She giggled and raised her thumb to his lips, swiping across and gathering some excess sauce and bringing it to her own mouth.</p><p>She looked at him like she couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that and he knew that he was looking at her like he too couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d done that. More than anything though, he knew he was looking at her like he very much wanted her to do it again.\u00a0</p><p>Though he wouldn\u2019t mind if next time she just kissed it off of him. In fact he\u2019d go back into the kitchens right now and get a whole bottle of that sauce just so she could lick it off of him if that\u2019s what she wanted.\u00a0</p><p>He shook himself out of it and raised his glass to his lips again. The wine wasn\u2019t helping, it was a <i>heady </i>wine and it was making Sansa\u2019s already perfect features all the more alluring. It was also making her more at ease, and when Sansa was at ease she was <i>touchy</i>. Which was exactly as wonderful and terrible as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cSo why?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy?,\u201d he repeated dumbly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think they did this?,\u201d she clarified.\u00a0</p><p><i>Maybe because I am hopelessly in love with you and they are completely aware of it.\u00a0</i></p><p>\u201cBoredom?,\u201d he offered instead, earning that giggle once again.</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cOkay but this has been happening for <i>years</i>,\u201d Robb reminded her, \u201cI mean he has been in love with her for over a decade at least. She\u2019s been in love with him for just as long. How many millions of opportunities have they had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d she agreed and then smiled, \u201cBut that\u2019s when the table does it\u2019s magic\u2026\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>It was on the second bottle of wine that the banquette seemed to get smaller. Or perhaps the restaurant just got louder.\u00a0</p><p>Either way, she and Jon got closer.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d she told him as the waiter handed them their dessert menus.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said with a grin, giving it a once over, and looking up at the waiter, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have one of the lemon tarts, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trouble, Jon Snow,\u201d she said, taking another sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know Theon\u2019s theory on that phrase\u2026,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>Their plates had been cleared and he now rested one forearm on the table, and the other on the back of the banquette. She had found her way into the hollow of his arms and her legs were crossed towards him and their calves were touching and had been for some time.\u00a0</p><p>She blushed because she <i>did </i>know, but she traced the rim of her wine glass with her index finger and played dumb.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTheon has so many theories\u2026,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you can remember them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d he told her, and his voice was low when he added, \u201cBut this one just got suddenly more interesting.\u201d</p><p>He was playing with her, she was sure of it. Even still she liked that quality to his voice and even though she didn\u2019t know the rules quite yet she began to like this game.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo on then,\u201d she said, looking up at him through lowered lashes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 that\u2026\u201d</p><p>The tips of his ears had turned pink and his eyes were threatening to bug out of his head and she knew that he knew they were in uncharted territory.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI remember now,\u201d she said and took a small sip of wine.\u00a0</p><p>He chuckled sheepishly and said, \u201cSome of his theories are dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d she agreed, <i>but not this one</i>.\u00a0</p><p>He looked at her like he\u2019d heard her say it. Like she\u2019d shouted it at him. His eyes were trailing over her face like he was trying to see all of her at once and she realised in that moment that it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d looked at her like that.\u00a0</p><p>She knew that Ella and Robb knew about her feelings for Jon. That was, after all, why they\u2019d set this whole thing up.\u00a0</p><p>But she thought about Ella and Robb, the two people who loved her and knew her best in the world, and she thought that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have done this if they didn\u2019t at least <i>think </i>he might feel the same.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked him again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cThe more you talk about this, the more it kind of sounds like you are intending for them to end up in one of the restaurant bathrooms\u2026,\u201d Robb said with a shudder.</p><p>She giggled and shook her head, \u201cNot their style. You\u2026 on the other hand\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one time,\u201d he reasoned with her, his hand snaking up her stomach, over her breast, tracing her neck until he could cup her face, \u201cAnd it was your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?,\u201d she asked him stubbornly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou were you,\u201d he told her sweetly, \u201cWhen a guy like me is sitting next to the girl of his dreams and she, against all reason or sense, loves him back, there\u2019s only one thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>***</p><p>It was now or never.\u00a0</p><p>He had realised halfway through the first bottle of wine that Robb and Ella, the two most caring friends in the world, would never have put him in this situation if they didn\u2019t at least have an <i>inkling </i>that Sansa may, or at least could, feel the way for him that he felt for her.\u00a0</p><p>He started to think so too during the second bottle of wine and she was so charming and lovely that he couldn\u2019t help but move closer to her.\u00a0</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seemed to mind that and so he\u2019d gotten closer still, because it was the only thing to do when a girl like her let you.\u00a0</p><p>And then she\u2019d said it. <i>You\u2019re trouble Jon Snow.\u00a0</i></p><p>According to Theon, when a girl said that it meant she\u2019d already pictured sleeping with you. He usually disregarded Theon\u2019s theories as utter crap, but this one\u2026 he would sorely like this one to be right.\u00a0</p><p>She was looking at him like it maybe was right and he panicked and backtracked but she hadn\u2019t. Sansa Stark was many things but a coward wasn\u2019t one of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they did this?,\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought you deserved better than what you\u2019ve gotten,\u201d he told her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t cockiness that made him say it. There was no pride in being better than her exes.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know it is,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that for you to know it to be true?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been there through every relationship. The tears and the betrayals, the cheating, even the one <i>hitting</i>. He\u2019d seen it all and he always told her that she deserved better, that she deserved to be cherished and treated like the angel that she was.\u00a0</p><p>She never believed him though, maybe because he\u2019d never shown her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s you they were looking out for,\u201d she mused, \u201cAfter Ygritte and Val\u2026 maybe they thought you needed someone more\u2026\u201d</p><p>She trailed off as though she couldn\u2019t think of any way that she was better than the girls he\u2019d dated before. As though she wasn\u2019t miles ahead of any other girl that could possibly have come before. As though she wasn\u2019t the human embodiment of perfection.</p><p>\u201cKind?,\u201d he asked her, \u201cThoughtful? Lovely in every conceivable way\u2026?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with her wide blue eyes, a delicious blush rising on her cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>He lifted his arm that had been resting on the banquette and took his hand and brushed some silky hair off of her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she said and he stopped as though cold water had been splashed on him.\u00a0</p><p>He had been about to lean in, but he must have been imagining it. He must have misread it. Of course he had. How could a girl like her ever want <i>him</i>?\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYeah?,\u201d he managed to ask.\u00a0</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and asked, \u201cDo you remember my thirteenth birthday party?\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cSo just like that, huh?,\u201d Robb asked. \u201cAfter years of wanting one another, they\u2019ll just give in, all because of a booth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot because of a booth,\u201d she shook her head, \u201cBecause they know <i>us</i>. When they stop doubting themselves they\u2019ll realise that we would never do this unless we knew they were both all in.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere were you a decade ago?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRight here, by their side,\u201d she said, \u201cHoping they\u2019d stop being idiots long enough to see the most obvious truth of them all.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>She was an idiot and she\u2019d ruined it.\u00a0</p><p>He had been looking at her like he might kiss her and then she\u2019d just <i>ruined </i>it.\u00a0</p><p>Jon placed his arm back on the banquette and moved the other to reach for the bottle of wine. He poured the last drops into her glass and his and then looked at her.\u00a0</p><p>He went to set it back down on the table, but instead of putting it standing upright he\u2019d laid it on it\u2019s side and turned it, definitively, and beautifully, towards her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s twelve years too late,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd my palms are still sweaty but I love you even more now than I did then. <i>Happy birthday, Sansa Stark.</i>\u201d</p><p>And just like that he kissed her. He kissed her and she was thirteen again. Nothing bad had ever happened to her. She had never been cheated on, no boy had ever yelled at her, there was certainly no boy who had ever hit her. He kissed her and it was like she was pure and unsullied once again.\u00a0</p><p>And he loved her.\u00a0</p><p>She kissed him back, because she loved him too. She\u2019d loved him at her boy-girl party and during every relationship that followed. She\u2019d loved him at Robb and Ella\u2019s wedding when he\u2019d walked right over to her while she was standing with Ramsay. They\u2019d been fighting about something because he was <i>ruining </i>what was meant to be a wonderful day and Jon had taken her hand, and said, \u201cSorry mate, it\u2019s tradition,\u201d because he\u2019d been the best man and she\u2019d been the maid of honor but he hadn\u2019t <i>seemed </i>sorry at all.\u00a0</p><p>And he\u2019d held her so gently and said, \u201c<i>Why are you doing this to yourself again, Dovey?</i>\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d said, \u201c<i>I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Just dance with me a bit longer, won\u2019t you?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ll dance with you all night,</i>\u201d he promised, \u201c<i>If it keeps you out of his reach.</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d she broke away and his eyes were as black as midnight and he moved to get away from her but she held him close, close enough that no one else could reach her. \u201cIf it\u2019s not forever. I won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been always,\u201d he told her, \u201cAnd it\u2019ll be forever too. Just love me back, Dovey, because you own me. I\u2019ll love you either way but it\u2019ll make forever so much better if you <i>just</i> love me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had much choice when it comes to loving you,\u201d she confessed, \u201cNo choice at all. I just do. I always have and I always will. I love you <i>Jon Elliot Snow.</i>\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, and she was no longer thirteen, she was twenty five, and though it might have been twelve years too late, it was all the sweeter knowing that she\u2019d never have to live without it again.\u00a0</p><p>***</p><p>They must have fallen asleep before she finished the story, because it was light outside when her eyes opened.\u00a0</p><p>She was alone in bed, well Grey Wind was there but Robb was gone, and she rose and brushed her teeth, slipping on her slippers before padding into the kitchen.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMorning sweetheart,\u201d Robb said from the stove where he was making pancakes.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?,\u201d she asked, pressing a kiss to his shoulder blade on her way to get a glass of water.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten,\u201d he said and she heard his grin when he said, \u201cMom thinks that means it\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d only told his parents so far. Well, now Jon and Sansa knew too but no one else. She got emotional every time she thought about her goodparents\u2019 reaction to the news and she went and hugged him from behind.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t?,\u201d she asked softly.\u00a0</p><p>She knew he wanted a boy. He wanted many children but he wanted a boy first.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThen our daughter will be another beauty, just like her mother, and I will love her more than life itself, just like I do her mother,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She turned him around and stood on her tiptoes so that she could kiss him. She loved him so madly, and the way he loved her was her favorite thing about herself.\u00a0</p><p>It was the only reason why she\u2019d done what she did, so that Jon and Sansa could know the happiness that she and Robb had been lucky to have for so long.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should call them?,\u201d she asked with a hopeful smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were wrong?,\u201d he asked her. She fixed him with a look and he grinned, \u201cLet\u2019s call Sansa first.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialled the familiar number. She answered after two rings.</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d Sansa squealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE PREGNANT!,\u201d they yelled back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say, Auntie Sansa?,\u201d she asked, \u201cCan we count on you as godmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can!,\u201d Sansa giggled, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hug you both, right after I MURDER you!\u201d</p><p>Ella felt fear for the first time in this whole thing and she said slowly, \u201cDid\u2026 did it not go well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon they want to know how our date went,\u201d she heard Sansa say and Ella screamed bloody murder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly,\u201d Jon said sleepily.</p><p>\u201cBy the gods,\u201d Robb grumbled as she jumped up and down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTerribly is it?,\u201d Sansa asked flirtatiously and she could practically see her pout.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jon said with a smile in his voice, \u201cThink I\u2019ll have to take you out again tonight just to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to dinner at our place,\u201d Ella offered, \u201cWe can celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby or relationship?,\u201d Robb asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBoth, everything! I don\u2019t care just will you come over tonight please? You\u2019ll forgive me for meddling, won\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou?,\u201d Sansa scoffed, \u201cWe had this pegged as being all Robb\u2019s idea\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally someone recognises my genius,\u201d Robb said as though long suffering.\u00a0</p><p>They all said their goodbyes and hung up with promises of dinner later and she hopped up on the counter as Robb handed her a plate of pancakes and a fork.\u00a0</p><p>She hummed to herself as she bit into one and he ate his own with a small smile on his face.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already planning their wedding, aren\u2019t you?,\u201d he asked her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in June,\u201d she nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s Sansa\u2019s favorite month\u2026 you\u2019ll wear a kilt. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElla\u2026,\u201d he warned.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI just want Sansa to be loved the way you love me. And I want Jon to be loved the way I love you. Is that so terrible?,\u201d she asked him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cLike everything about you, that is absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>\u201cYou know Ella will have us married off come Winter, don\u2019t you?,\u201d she asked Jon as he pulled her to his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFine by me,\u201d he said, his fingers trailing her naked back, \u201cThough I thought you\u2019d want to get married in June.\u201d</p><p><strike>\u201c</strike>What makes you say that?,\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite month,\u201d he reminded her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2026,\u201d she trailed off, not wanting to ruin the perfection of the evening and the morning by saying anything stupid.</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant,\u201d he said, tilting her chin up so she had to look at him, \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll marry you any month, any day, any hour that you want. I\u2019ll marry you in front of 500 people or in a court house with just Robb and Ella as witnesses. What did you think I meant by forever, Sansa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune sounds good,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cWhat will we do until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said with a devilish grin, rolling them over so he was on top of her, \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d she mused, as he kissed down her neck to her breasts, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of somethings\u2026\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her and grinned roguishly, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p>",

Robb &amp; Ella being absolutely determined to get their best friends to date bc it&rsquo;s so damn obvious to everyone else &amp; finally get them each to go on a blind date but it&rsquo;s with eachother?? idk if that&rsquo;s any good and again only if it inspires you oh my gosh<br /></p><p>As a PSA to all: I love prompts! Please send along.</p><p><br /></p><p>**</p><p>Jon walked into <i>Last Hearth</i>, one of those New-Westerosi restaurants obsessed with brussel sprouts and truffle oil, at three minutes to 8 o&rsquo;clock on Friday night.&nbsp;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t much for these kinds of restaurants, preferring to eat at home or at Winterfell, but of all of them, this was admittedly his favorite.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Okay just remember you like The Wight vintage 74 and the meatloaf,&rdquo; Ella said to him as he pulled on the charcoal sweater she&rsquo;d insisted he wear.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ella I can order for myself!,&rdquo; he growled, annoyed by how much more comfortable he felt in the sweater she&rsquo;d suggested than the button down he&rsquo;d intended to wear. &ldquo;Just like I can find my own dates!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If you were better at finding your own dates we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation, now would we?,&rdquo; she asked with a skeptical raise of her brow. Her face softened, &ldquo;And I know you are perfectly capable of deciding what to eat and drink and everything else&hellip; I just want you to be happy.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I know you do, Ella,&rdquo; he said with a sigh.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Ella was always well-intentioned. It was frustrating. Not as frustrating as her always being right though.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Now is this really necessary?,&rdquo; he asked, holding up the flower she&rsquo;d given him.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;A winter rose. She&rsquo;ll have one too.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Jon couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that he&rsquo;d agreed to a blind date. He had never been on one before, and quite honestly, they had always been his nightmare. He wasn&rsquo;t really one for small talk and that was all a blind date could be.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus the uncertainty of it all. At least with a regular first date you know the girl found you <i>mildly </i>appealing. This was a total shot in the dark.&nbsp;</p><p>He gave Robb&rsquo;s name to the maitre&rsquo;d. That was all a part of it, Ella loved suspense.&nbsp;</p><p>He was ushered over to a table in the corner. He knew it must be coveted, two corners of it were on a banquette, which Ella had told him long ago made things more <i>romantic. </i>According to her, Robb would always whisper sweet things in her ear over dessert, though according to Robb, they were usually utterly filthy.&nbsp;</p><p>He sat down and waited, setting the blue rose onto the table in front of him. He wanted a glass of whiskey, but he knew that wouldn&rsquo;t exactly make the best impression on his date and he had been assured by both Robb and Ella that she was worth making a good impression on her.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stunning,&rdquo; Ella said.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And so sweet,&rdquo; Robb confirmed.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll adore her,&rdquo; Ella promised.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;I bet by the end of dinner you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve known her for years,&rdquo; Robb offered.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Jon highly doubted it, even though he usually trusted Robb and Ella implicitly.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned towards the door and saw a slender figure in a navy blue dress being escorted right towards him. He saw the rose before anything else and then his eyes landed on the most beautiful face he&rsquo;d ever seen.&nbsp;</p><p>He stood up, his throat was dry and he really wished he&rsquo;d given in and had that whiskey.&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at him questioningly, as though she didn&rsquo;t understand why the maitre&rsquo;d was bringing her towards him, so he reached on the table and picked up the winter rose, waving it slightly.&nbsp;</p><p>Realisation dawned in her eyes and he looked away from them in case disappointment came to rest there. He wasn&rsquo;t sure that he could take it if he did.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon Snow,&rdquo; she said by way of greeting.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa Stark,&rdquo; he offered in return.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve known her for years,&rdquo; </i>Robb had said. Robb his hilarious and completely dead best friend.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh he&rsquo;d known her for years, ever since he&rsquo;d met Robb in pre-school and she&rsquo;d been gurgling happily in her bouncy seat. He&rsquo;d known her for all but one of her twenty five years.&nbsp;</p><p>And he&rsquo;d been in love with her for at least twelve of them.</p><p>***</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that she&rsquo;d allowed Robb to talk her into this.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d caught her of guard last week by asking. In all her life, she had never known her big brother to encourage her to date. He wanted her to be happy, she knew, but if that happiness could be achieved by spending all of her time safe with him and Ella and their family then more the better.&nbsp;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you want to set me up with someone,&rdquo; she scoffed, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the same man who has threatened every one of my last four boyfriends?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well yeah,&rdquo; Robb nodded, stuffing his face with the lemon bars she&rsquo;d made for the whole family. The plate was now halfway gone. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s because they were assholes who didn&rsquo;t deserve you. At least this way, I know he&rsquo;s a good guy. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve you - no one could - but he won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not playing fair,&rdquo; she whined.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>He was so good, and so caring, it was obnoxious.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Never have, never will,&rdquo; he grinned,&ldquo;Come on Dovey. Give happiness just one more chance.&rdquo;</i></p><p>So it was that at 8 o&rsquo;clock on the dot she walked into Last Hearth, her favorite restaurant in the city (they had the yummiest brussel sprouts).&nbsp;</p><p>She smoothed down the dress Robb had suggested, though she suspected that came from Ella. It was navy blue and silk and she was pleased that other patrons were dressed similarly. It was a great tragedy that no one seemed to dress up anymore and she wouldn&rsquo;t want her date to think she&rsquo;d been <i>so </i>eager to please.&nbsp;</p><p>She gave Robb&rsquo;s name to the maitre&rsquo;d and he nodded at her and escorted her through the dining room.</p><p>She fiddled with the Winter Rose she held in her hand nervously and looked around.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, to her utter dismay, she saw Jon Snow of all people sitting at the corner table.</p><p><i>Why does he have to be here? Couldn&rsquo;t the gods have at least given whatever poor bastard has been set up with me a chance? How am I supposed to care about them when Jon Elliot Snow is sitting a few tables away?</i></p><p>Jon stood up when he saw her and she was about to say to the maitre&rsquo;d that she was just going to greet a friend quickly when he waved something at her. A single Winter Rose.&nbsp;</p><p>She tried to keep her face placid, though she searched his for signs of disappointment. He averted her gaze and her stomach plummetted. Of course, he had thought tonight was a date, a real date with a girl he might really be interested in. She wondered briefly if he had thought that he was going to get laid tonight and blushed at the thought.&nbsp;</p><p>The maitre&rsquo;d stood in front of Jon with a flourish as though this was a great unveiling and she mustered all of her strength to greet him with a calm, &ldquo;Jon Snow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sansa Stark,&rdquo; he said in that velvet voice that always made her name sound like a caress.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Your waiter will be with you in a moment,&rdquo; the maitre&rsquo;d said and took his leave.</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip; I assume that Winter Rose isn&rsquo;t a coincidence?,&rdquo; Jon asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you prefer to pretend that it was?,&rdquo; she couldn&rsquo;t help but ask.&nbsp;</p><p>He blanched and she regretted it instantly but he recovered quickly, a small smile whispering in the corner of his eyes, &ldquo;Of course not. You look beautiful, Dovey,&rdquo; he said kissing her cheek, &ldquo;Like always.&rdquo;</p><p>He had always been kind, unfailingly so, and he&rsquo;d been calling her beautiful since before she knew that not everyone in the world was. It didn&rsquo;t <i>mean </i>anything, she knew that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well you certainly clean up nice,&rdquo; she said back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I chose that color over the blue.&rdquo;</p><p>He was wearing the sweater she&rsquo;d bought him for his birthday last year. Another detail to thank Ella for she was sure.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; he nodded, the tips of his ears turning pink, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favorite&hellip; should we um&hellip;?,&rdquo; he asked gesturing to the banquette.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; she nodded and they sat down.&nbsp;</p><p>They were seated at the corner table, the most romantic one in the restaurant, and according to Northern Times, the most romantic one in the city.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So&hellip;,&rdquo; she said, suddenly completely incapable of thinking of anything interesting to say.&nbsp;</p><p>Love had a way of making a smart girl stupid.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think this will work?,&rdquo; Robb asked her.</p><p>Ella rolled her eyes, &ldquo;Are you starting to doubt me now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he said, pulling her to him, &ldquo;I just know how stubborn they are&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which is why our intervention was necessary,&rdquo; she reasoned, running her hands over his sweater-clad chest. She wrapped her arms around him and laid her cheek over his heart and went on, &ldquo;The good news is that they are as predictable as they are stubborn. In fact, I can tell you exactly how it&rsquo;s going to go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that right?,&rdquo; he asked with a grin, &ldquo;Go on then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First&hellip; they are going to to act as though they are angry with us because neither of them realises that the other one is just as head over heels for <i>them</i>&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <i>kill </i>Robb and Ella,&rdquo; Jon grumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a little unfair,&rdquo; she scoffed and his eyes widened. He opened his mouth to protest, to tell her that he didn&rsquo;t mean that in a bad way about her, but she said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way Robb had the foresight to do this. Killing Ella will probably be sufficient.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled and nodded, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll forgive him, he knows not what he does.&rdquo;</p><p>She giggled wind chimes and then her face fell, &ldquo;Do you&hellip; Well&hellip; I mean&hellip; I&rsquo;d understand if you wanted to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to ruin your Friday evening&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p><i>Ruin. You&rsquo;re cute.</i></p><p>How many times had he imagined asking her out? No more than the number of times that he&rsquo;d chickened out.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d been mad about her at least since she was thirteen years old. Before then he hadn&rsquo;t quite <i>realised </i>why he always got sweaty around her and why her opinion seemed to matter so much.&nbsp;</p><p>It had all changed on her thirteenth birthday. It was the first year she had a boy-girl party and he and Robb and Theon had all promised to attend. It was no skin off Robb&rsquo;s nose who had already been dating Ella for a year at that point, having realised much earlier (at the age of eight during a terrible thunderstorm) that she was his beloved. &nbsp;</p><p>They played spin the bottle and Sansa had spun first, she being the birthday girl. He had somehow been next to Joffrey, Ella&rsquo;s horrible older brother, and the bottle had landed right in between them. It had been Joffrey who had taken the bottle and turned it towards himself before marching proudly over and planting a kiss on Sansa&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;</p><p>She had been beet red but his knuckles had been white he was so angry. He realised then that he wasn&rsquo;t just angry, he was <i>jealous</i>, and more than anything he was <i>upset</i> that it hadn&rsquo;t been him.&nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d pushed those feelings down, always coming up with some excuse or other not to pursue her. But now sitting next to her all of those excuses fell right out of his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well um&hellip; we&rsquo;re both here, right?,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;We have to eat&hellip; and I know how much you love their kale or whatever green thing is most popular this week.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their <i>brussel sprouts </i>and they are <i>iconic </i>and <i>timeless</i>,<i>&rdquo; </i>she said haughtily.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said, picking up his menu with a flourish and earning that giggle again.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, well that could last through dessert&hellip;,&rdquo; Robb reasoned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Ella said with a smile, &ldquo;Because then we bring out the trump card&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>It became quite clear that in order for her to get through this date, alcohol would have to be involved.</p><p>They&rsquo;d at least made it through the initial awkwardness, there was no icebreaker greater than how impossibly annoying their completely loving and totally wonderful best friends could be.&nbsp;</p><p>And it wasn&rsquo;t as though, once she had slowed her heart rate, that Jon was so difficult to talk to or anything. He wasn&rsquo;t much one for small talk, but there was no need for small talk between them. She had always seemed to confide in him, all apart from one topic of course, because he was such a good listener. He <i>really </i>listened, thoughtfully, always nodding and never interrupting. He&rsquo;d ask questions that made you <i>know </i>he was really thinking about what you were saying.&nbsp;</p><p>Even still he smelled so good and he looked so good and he was sitting so very close to her that she was afraid if she didn&rsquo;t have something to do with her hands she might just removed his hair from it&rsquo;s bun and run her fingers through it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this red wine here that I really like actually,&rdquo; Jon said, as though reading her mind. &ldquo;If you wanted to split a bottle? Though if you&rsquo;d prefer a lemon drop martini I can get something else&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She told herself that it didn&rsquo;t matter that he knew her favorite drink. If he was sitting with Arya or Robb or Ella he&rsquo;d know what all of their favorite drinks were too. He just knew everything about her, the way you did with the people you knew your entire life.&nbsp;</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t mean anything, but she blushed all the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Wine sounds good,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;Which bottle is it?&rdquo;</p><p>She picked up the wine list and because they were on a corner, it was very easy for him to lean in next to her. He really did smell so good and he&rsquo;d trimmed his beard for tonight and she had the ridiculous urge to lick his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&hellip;Ella even <i>told </i>me it before I came&hellip; um&hellip;,&rdquo; he said scanning over the list.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; a voice said from above them and they looked to find a waiter proffering a bottle. &ldquo;A bottle of The Wight 74, with compliments&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that-,&rdquo; she started.</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jon confirmed with his eyes closed.</p><p>Sansa had to bite the inside of her cheek to keep from smiling. He was so adorable when he was annoyed.</p><p>She remembered her thirteenth birthday. She had been upset when it had been Joffrey who she&rsquo;d ended up kissing and had gone outside to get some fresh air and found him there. He was snippy with her and she&rsquo;d gotten angry and then as though he couldn&rsquo;t help it he just grabbed a small box out of his pocket and shoved it at her. It had been a necklace with a dragonfly on it and he&rsquo;d been so surprised when she wanted to put it on immediately. She still had it and was surprised Ella hadn&rsquo;t recommended she wear it.</p><p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be compliments of an Ella Stark, would it?,&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>The waiter smiled and, as though he&rsquo;d been anticipating that question, said, &ldquo;The party has asked to remain nameless to protect your unborn godchild.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unbo-,&rdquo; Jon said and then looked at her.</p><p>Tears pricked her eyes as she looked back. She knew that Ella and Robb had been trying for a few months but Robb hadn&rsquo;t said anything when she&rsquo;d seen him earlier.</p><p>She started to laugh and so did Jon. There were tears in his eyes and she wiped the ones running down her cheeks. He pulled her to him and she sank into his embrace and she squealed and they both laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>It was so wonderful to hear this news with <i>him </i>of all people who would love the baby just as much as her. It felt so right to be with him and it reminded her how no matter what, they would always be inextricably linked.</p><p>Just like Ella intended.</p><p>&ldquo;May I?,&rdquo; the waiter asked.</p><p>She&rsquo;d forgotten he was there and she nodded, easing reluctantly out of Jon&rsquo;s embrace.&nbsp;</p><p>The waiter set about uncorking it and she couldn&rsquo;t take it, she threw her arms around Jon&rsquo;s neck, wiggling all the while.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I get to be Auntie Sansa!,&rdquo; she giggled. <i>Another little Stark to love</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Uncle Jon,&rdquo; he mused, cupping the back of her head and pressing a kiss to her hair.&nbsp;</p><p>He was going to be a wonderful uncle, of that she was sure. If the baby was a boy, he&rsquo;d want to be just like his Uncle Jon - brave and gentle and strong - and if the baby was a little girl, he&rsquo;d treat her like a princess, the way he&rsquo;d always treated Ella.&nbsp;</p><p>The way he&rsquo;d always treated her.&nbsp;</p><p>Their waiter poured them a glass each and made himself scarce.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon picked up his and held it to her, &ldquo;To our niece or nephew,&rdquo; he said and she raised hers as well, &ldquo;And their meddlesome parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to you, Uncle Jon,&rdquo; she said with a smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Auntie Sansa,&rdquo; he said with a small shake of his head, his eyes on hers as their glasses touched.&nbsp;</p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Good work little one,&rdquo; Robb said, kissing her stomach.&nbsp;</p><p>She stroked his rich auburn curls and sighed happily.&nbsp;</p><p>He leaned his cheek upon her stomach now, they were splayed out on their big bed, the baby making her tired already.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me what happens next,&rdquo; he said, as though this were a bedtime story that she&rsquo;d soon tell their child.&nbsp;</p><p>She closed her eyes and thought about the two people they loved the most and said with a lazy smile, &ldquo;Next, Sansa will get giggly and Jon will get horny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ella!,&rdquo; Robb complained.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You asked&hellip;,&rdquo; she reminded him.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Oh my god,&rdquo; </i>she moaned and Jon made sure his napkin was well and truly covering his lap.&nbsp;</p><p>The brussel sprouts had finally arrived along with tuna tartare and freshly baked bread. Everything was delicious, including the wine, and Sansa was very appreciative.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously Jon,&rdquo; she said, stabbing a sprout gently with her fork and raising it towards him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to try this.&rdquo;</p><p>He accepted the bite and fought the urge to moan himself, chewing it and nodding at her.&nbsp;</p><p>She giggled and raised her thumb to his lips, swiping across and gathering some excess sauce and bringing it to her own mouth.</p><p>She looked at him like she couldn&rsquo;t believe that she&rsquo;d done that and he knew that he was looking at her like he too couldn&rsquo;t believe that she&rsquo;d done that. More than anything though, he knew he was looking at her like he very much wanted her to do it again.&nbsp;</p><p>Though he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if next time she just kissed it off of him. In fact he&rsquo;d go back into the kitchens right now and get a whole bottle of that sauce just so she could lick it off of him if that&rsquo;s what she wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>He shook himself out of it and raised his glass to his lips again. The wine wasn&rsquo;t helping, it was a <i>heady </i>wine and it was making Sansa&rsquo;s already perfect features all the more alluring. It was also making her more at ease, and when Sansa was at ease she was <i>touchy</i>. Which was exactly as wonderful and terrible as it sounded.</p><p>&ldquo;So why?,&rdquo; she asked him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?,&rdquo; he repeated dumbly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think they did this?,&rdquo; she clarified.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Maybe because I am hopelessly in love with you and they are completely aware of it.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Boredom?,&rdquo; he offered instead, earning that giggle once again.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;Okay but this has been happening for <i>years</i>,&rdquo; Robb reminded her, &ldquo;I mean he has been in love with her for over a decade at least. She&rsquo;s been in love with him for just as long. How many millions of opportunities have they had?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too many,&rdquo; she agreed and then smiled, &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s when the table does it&rsquo;s magic&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>It was on the second bottle of wine that the banquette seemed to get smaller. Or perhaps the restaurant just got louder.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, she and Jon got closer.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat anymore,&rdquo; she told him as the waiter handed them their dessert menus.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said with a grin, giving it a once over, and looking up at the waiter, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have one of the lemon tarts, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trouble, Jon Snow,&rdquo; she said, taking another sip of wine.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know Theon&rsquo;s theory on that phrase&hellip;,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Their plates had been cleared and he now rested one forearm on the table, and the other on the back of the banquette. She had found her way into the hollow of his arms and her legs were crossed towards him and their calves were touching and had been for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>She blushed because she <i>did </i>know, but she traced the rim of her wine glass with her index finger and played dumb.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Theon has so many theories&hellip;,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised you can remember them all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; he told her, and his voice was low when he added, &ldquo;But this one just got suddenly more interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>He was playing with her, she was sure of it. Even still she liked that quality to his voice and even though she didn&rsquo;t know the rules quite yet she began to like this game.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on then,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him through lowered lashes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, clearing his throat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; um&hellip; that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The tips of his ears had turned pink and his eyes were threatening to bug out of his head and she knew that he knew they were in uncharted territory.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; she said and took a small sip of wine.&nbsp;</p><p>He chuckled sheepishly and said, &ldquo;Some of his theories are dumb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; she agreed, <i>but not this one</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>He looked at her like he&rsquo;d heard her say it. Like she&rsquo;d shouted it at him. His eyes were trailing over her face like he was trying to see all of her at once and she realised in that moment that it wasn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;d looked at her like that.&nbsp;</p><p>She knew that Ella and Robb knew about her feelings for Jon. That was, after all, why they&rsquo;d set this whole thing up.&nbsp;</p><p>But she thought about Ella and Robb, the two people who loved her and knew her best in the world, and she thought that maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t have done this if they didn&rsquo;t at least <i>think </i>he might feel the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think they did this?,&rdquo; she asked him again.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;The more you talk about this, the more it kind of sounds like you are intending for them to end up in one of the restaurant bathrooms&hellip;,&rdquo; Robb said with a shudder.</p><p>She giggled and shook her head, &ldquo;Not their style. You&hellip; on the other hand&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was one time,&rdquo; he reasoned with her, his hand snaking up her stomach, over her breast, tracing her neck until he could cup her face, &ldquo;And it was your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did I do?,&rdquo; she asked him stubbornly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You were you,&rdquo; he told her sweetly, &ldquo;When a guy like me is sitting next to the girl of his dreams and she, against all reason or sense, loves him back, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; she said with a smile.</p><p>***</p><p>It was now or never.&nbsp;</p><p>He had realised halfway through the first bottle of wine that Robb and Ella, the two most caring friends in the world, would never have put him in this situation if they didn&rsquo;t at least have an <i>inkling </i>that Sansa may, or at least could, feel the way for him that he felt for her.&nbsp;</p><p>He started to think so too during the second bottle of wine and she was so charming and lovely that he couldn&rsquo;t help but move closer to her.&nbsp;</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t seemed to mind that and so he&rsquo;d gotten closer still, because it was the only thing to do when a girl like her let you.&nbsp;</p><p>And then she&rsquo;d said it. <i>You&rsquo;re trouble Jon Snow.&nbsp;</i></p><p>According to Theon, when a girl said that it meant she&rsquo;d already pictured sleeping with you. He usually disregarded Theon&rsquo;s theories as utter crap, but this one&hellip; he would sorely like this one to be right.&nbsp;</p><p>She was looking at him like it maybe was right and he panicked and backtracked but she hadn&rsquo;t. Sansa Stark was many things but a coward wasn&rsquo;t one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you think they did this?,&rdquo; she asked again.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they thought you deserved better than what you&rsquo;ve gotten,&rdquo; he told her.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t cockiness that made him say it. There was no pride in being better than her exes.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what you think?,&rdquo; she asked softly.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know it is,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;How many times do I have to tell you that for you to know it to be true?&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d been there through every relationship. The tears and the betrayals, the cheating, even the one <i>hitting</i>. He&rsquo;d seen it all and he always told her that she deserved better, that she deserved to be cherished and treated like the angel that she was.&nbsp;</p><p>She never believed him though, maybe because he&rsquo;d never shown her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s you they were looking out for,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;After Ygritte and Val&hellip; maybe they thought you needed someone more&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>She trailed off as though she couldn&rsquo;t think of any way that she was better than the girls he&rsquo;d dated before. As though she wasn&rsquo;t miles ahead of any other girl that could possibly have come before. As though she wasn&rsquo;t the human embodiment of perfection.</p><p>&ldquo;Kind?,&rdquo; he asked her, &ldquo;Thoughtful? Lovely in every conceivable way&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>She looked at him with her wide blue eyes, a delicious blush rising on her cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>He lifted his arm that had been resting on the banquette and took his hand and brushed some silky hair off of her face and tucked it behind her ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon,&rdquo; she said and he stopped as though cold water had been splashed on him.&nbsp;</p><p>He had been about to lean in, but he must have been imagining it. He must have misread it. Of course he had. How could a girl like her ever want <i>him</i>?&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah?,&rdquo; he managed to ask.&nbsp;</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and asked, &ldquo;Do you remember my thirteenth birthday party?&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;So just like that, huh?,&rdquo; Robb asked. &ldquo;After years of wanting one another, they&rsquo;ll just give in, all because of a booth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not because of a booth,&rdquo; she shook her head, &ldquo;Because they know <i>us</i>. When they stop doubting themselves they&rsquo;ll realise that we would never do this unless we knew they were both all in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where were you a decade ago?,&rdquo; he asked her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Right here, by their side,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Hoping they&rsquo;d stop being idiots long enough to see the most obvious truth of them all.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>She was an idiot and she&rsquo;d ruined it.&nbsp;</p><p>He had been looking at her like he might kiss her and then she&rsquo;d just <i>ruined </i>it.&nbsp;</p><p>Jon placed his arm back on the banquette and moved the other to reach for the bottle of wine. He poured the last drops into her glass and his and then looked at her.&nbsp;</p><p>He went to set it back down on the table, but instead of putting it standing upright he&rsquo;d laid it on it&rsquo;s side and turned it, definitively, and beautifully, towards her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s twelve years too late,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And my palms are still sweaty but I love you even more now than I did then. <i>Happy birthday, Sansa Stark.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>And just like that he kissed her. He kissed her and she was thirteen again. Nothing bad had ever happened to her. She had never been cheated on, no boy had ever yelled at her, there was certainly no boy who had ever hit her. He kissed her and it was like she was pure and unsullied once again.&nbsp;</p><p>And he loved her.&nbsp;</p><p>She kissed him back, because she loved him too. She&rsquo;d loved him at her boy-girl party and during every relationship that followed. She&rsquo;d loved him at Robb and Ella&rsquo;s wedding when he&rsquo;d walked right over to her while she was standing with Ramsay. They&rsquo;d been fighting about something because he was <i>ruining </i>what was meant to be a wonderful day and Jon had taken her hand, and said, &ldquo;Sorry mate, it&rsquo;s tradition,&rdquo; because he&rsquo;d been the best man and she&rsquo;d been the maid of honor but he hadn&rsquo;t <i>seemed </i>sorry at all.&nbsp;</p><p>And he&rsquo;d held her so gently and said, &ldquo;<i>Why are you doing this to yourself again, Dovey?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>And she&rsquo;d said, &ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. Just dance with me a bit longer, won&rsquo;t you?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll dance with you all night,</i>&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;<i>If it keeps you out of his reach.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do this,&rdquo; she broke away and his eyes were as black as midnight and he moved to get away from her but she held him close, close enough that no one else could reach her. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not forever. I won&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already been always,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll be forever too. Just love me back, Dovey, because you own me. I&rsquo;ll love you either way but it&rsquo;ll make forever so much better if you <i>just</i> love me back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had much choice when it comes to loving you,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;No choice at all. I just do. I always have and I always will. I love you <i>Jon Elliot Snow.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>He kissed her again, and she was no longer thirteen, she was twenty five, and though it might have been twelve years too late, it was all the sweeter knowing that she&rsquo;d never have to live without it again.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>They must have fallen asleep before she finished the story, because it was light outside when her eyes opened.&nbsp;</p><p>She was alone in bed, well Grey Wind was there but Robb was gone, and she rose and brushed her teeth, slipping on her slippers before padding into the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning sweetheart,&rdquo; Robb said from the stove where he was making pancakes.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?,&rdquo; she asked, pressing a kiss to his shoulder blade on her way to get a glass of water.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Almost ten,&rdquo; he said and she heard his grin when he said, &ldquo;Mom thinks that means it&rsquo;s a boy.&rdquo;</p><p>They&rsquo;d only told his parents so far. Well, now Jon and Sansa knew too but no one else. She got emotional every time she thought about her goodparents&rsquo; reaction to the news and she went and hugged him from behind.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And if it isn&rsquo;t?,&rdquo; she asked softly.&nbsp;</p><p>She knew he wanted a boy. He wanted many children but he wanted a boy first.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Then our daughter will be another beauty, just like her mother, and I will love her more than life itself, just like I do her mother,&rdquo; he promised her.</p><p>She turned him around and stood on her tiptoes so that she could kiss him. She loved him so madly, and the way he loved her was her favorite thing about herself.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the only reason why she&rsquo;d done what she did, so that Jon and Sansa could know the happiness that she and Robb had been lucky to have for so long.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think we should call them?,&rdquo; she asked with a hopeful smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What if you were wrong?,&rdquo; he asked her. She fixed him with a look and he grinned, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call Sansa first.&rdquo;</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialled the familiar number. She answered after two rings.</p><p>&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE PREGNANT!,&rdquo; Sansa squealed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;WE&rsquo;RE PREGNANT!,&rdquo; they yelled back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say, Auntie Sansa?,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;Can we count on you as godmother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course you can!,&rdquo; Sansa giggled, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hug you both, right after I MURDER you!&rdquo;</p><p>Ella felt fear for the first time in this whole thing and she said slowly, &ldquo;Did&hellip; did it not go well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jon they want to know how our date went,&rdquo; she heard Sansa say and Ella screamed bloody murder.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Terribly,&rdquo; Jon said sleepily.</p><p>&ldquo;By the gods,&rdquo; Robb grumbled as she jumped up and down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Terribly is it?,&rdquo; Sansa asked flirtatiously and she could practically see her pout.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jon said with a smile in his voice, &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll have to take you out again tonight just to make up for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come to dinner at our place,&rdquo; Ella offered, &ldquo;We can celebrate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Baby or relationship?,&rdquo; Robb asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Both, everything! I don&rsquo;t care just will you come over tonight please? You&rsquo;ll forgive me for meddling, won&rsquo;t you?,&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You?,&rdquo; Sansa scoffed, &ldquo;We had this pegged as being all Robb&rsquo;s idea&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Finally someone recognises my genius,&rdquo; Robb said as though long suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>They all said their goodbyes and hung up with promises of dinner later and she hopped up on the counter as Robb handed her a plate of pancakes and a fork.&nbsp;</p><p>She hummed to herself as she bit into one and he ate his own with a small smile on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already planning their wedding, aren&rsquo;t you?,&rdquo; he asked her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be in June,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sansa&rsquo;s favorite month&hellip; you&rsquo;ll wear a kilt. Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll look great.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ella&hellip;,&rdquo; he warned.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I just want Sansa to be loved the way you love me. And I want Jon to be loved the way I love you. Is that so terrible?,&rdquo; she asked him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Like everything about you, that is absolutely perfect.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;You know Ella will have us married off come Winter, don&rsquo;t you?,&rdquo; she asked Jon as he pulled her to his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine by me,&rdquo; he said, his fingers trailing her naked back, &ldquo;Though I thought you&rsquo;d want to get married in June.&rdquo;</p><p><strike>&ldquo;</strike>What makes you say that?,&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your favorite month,&rdquo; he reminded her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I meant&hellip;,&rdquo; she trailed off, not wanting to ruin the perfection of the evening and the morning by saying anything stupid.</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you meant,&rdquo; he said, tilting her chin up so she had to look at him, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m telling you I&rsquo;ll marry you any month, any day, any hour that you want. I&rsquo;ll marry you in front of 500 people or in a court house with just Robb and Ella as witnesses. What did you think I meant by forever, Sansa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;June sounds good,&rdquo; she said with a smile, &ldquo;What will we do until then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not worried,&rdquo; he said with a devilish grin, rolling them over so he was on top of her, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think of something&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forever,&rdquo; she mused, as he kissed down her neck to her breasts, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of somethings&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He looked up at her and grinned roguishly, &ldquo;Shall we begin?&rdquo;</p>",

Please send along.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>Jon walked into <i>Last Hearth</i>, one of those New-Westerosi restaurants obsessed with brussel sprouts and truffle oil, at three minutes to 8 o&rsquo;clock on Friday night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He wasn&rsquo;t much for these kinds of restaurants, preferring to eat at home or at Winterfell, but of all of them, this was admittedly his favorite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Okay just remember you like The Wight vintage 74 and the meatloaf,&rdquo; Ella said to him as he pulled on the charcoal sweater she&rsquo;d insisted he wear.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Ella I can order for myself!,&rdquo; he growled, annoyed by how much more comfortable he felt in the sweater she&rsquo;d suggested than the button down he&rsquo;d intended to wear. &ldquo;Just like I can find my own dates!&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;If you were better at finding your own dates we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation, now would we?,&rdquo; she asked with a skeptical raise of her brow. Her face softened, &ldquo;And I know you are perfectly capable of deciding what to eat and drink and everything else&hellip; I just want you to be happy.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I know you do, Ella,&rdquo; he said with a sigh.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>Ella was always well-intentioned. It was frustrating. Not as frustrating as her always being right though.</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Now is this really necessary?,&rdquo; he asked, holding up the flower she&rsquo;d given him.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;A winter rose. She&rsquo;ll have one too.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>Jon couldn&rsquo;t quite believe that he&rsquo;d agreed to a blind date. He had never been on one before, and quite honestly, they had always been his nightmare. He wasn&rsquo;t really one for small talk and that was all a blind date could be.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plus the uncertainty of it all. At least with a regular first date you know the girl found you <i>mildly </i>appealing. This was a total shot in the dark.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He gave Robb&rsquo;s name to the maitre&rsquo;d. That was all a part of it, Ella loved suspense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He was ushered over to a table in the corner. He knew it must be coveted, two corners of it were on a banquette, which Ella had told him long ago made things more <i>romantic. </i>According to her, Robb would always whisper sweet things in her ear over dessert, though according to Robb, they were usually utterly filthy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He sat down and waited, setting the blue rose onto the table in front of him. He wanted a glass of whiskey, but he knew that wouldn&rsquo;t exactly make the best impression on his date and he had been assured by both Robb and Ella that she was worth making a good impression on her.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stunning,&rdquo; Ella said.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;And so sweet,&rdquo; Robb confirmed.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll adore her,&rdquo; Ella promised.</i></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;I bet by the end of dinner you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;ve known her for years,&rdquo; Robb offered.&nbsp;</i></p>\n</p>",

However, there is plenty of parallels between the two.)</p><p><b><i>Lady Graceford is described to be pale and elegant, words that are often used to describe Sansa.</i></b></p><p><i>This Lady Alyce Graceford shows up again later in ASOS&hellip;during Joffrey\u2019s wedding.\u00a0</i>Tyrion and Sansa are sitting next to Ser Garlan Tyrell and Lady Leonette Fossoway at Joffrey\u2019s wedding and Tyrion wonders this about Sansa&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDoes she wish it were her in Margaery\u2019s place?\u201d Tyrion frowned.

Whenever they did, his hand would gently rest upon her stomach, a tender and protective gesture.\u201d<br/></i></p><p><i>-Tyrion VIII, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Sitting almost at the foot of the table reminds me of how Jon was made to sit at the lower benches in the Great Hall of Winterfell during the welcome feast for King Robert Baratheon. The third table may be alluding to Jon being the third child of Rhaegar. Sitting on the left side to Joffrey who is king and newly married so gets the highest seat of honor, also denotes the place where the queen resides. Joffrey is a foil to Jon. So this Lady sitting to Joffrey\u2019s left denotes where Sansa might be sitting when she marries King Jon. (Tyrion and Sansa were sitting to Joffrey\u2019s right)</p><p>This pregnant woman is married to one of the Fossoways, does not say whether it is a green apple Fossoway or red apple Fossoway. She is seated close to the Tyrells, Margaery\u2019s cousins are sitting nearby. So I think, this pregnant lady is possibly the same Lady Alyce Graceford that we meet in Sansa I ASOS, considering the people she hangs out with are the same in both chapters. Her beauty in Tyrion VIII ASOS is described to be delicate, and kind of sounds similar to elegant and beautiful, all things that aptly describe Sansa.</p><p>But think how sweet and romantic this pair is, where the husband is feeding her morsels off his plate and they are drinking from the same cup&hellip;huh where have we seen that before????</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ae090bc94ad8679a3bd9de2f5ae352f/tumblr_inline_pg1wjxvyU71s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8bbf17b200ecd2765eecb578b5a7d3/tumblr_inline_pg1wk82HM91s6u549_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1440\" data-orig-height=\"900\"/></figure><p>YUP!!

I am sure other cultures have similar things but yeah sharing a drink is such a married people trope!</p><p>Plus I can totally imagine Jon doing all those things to a pregnant Sansa.\u00a0</p><p>Anyways back to Sansa I ASOS chapter, because there is more..</p><p>The song the Bear and the Maiden Fair is first sung in this chapter. Sansa and Jon are the Maiden and Bear in the song.</p><p>Following this Sansa chapter is Jon I, ASOS and here is what we find&hellip;</p><p>This is the chapter where Jon has been captured by the wildlings and taken to meet with Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall&hellip;here is how his tent is described.</p><blockquote><p><i>There was no doubting which tent was the <b>king\u2019s</b>. It was thrice the size of the next largest he\u2019d seen, and he could hear music drifting from within. Like many of the lesser tents, it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on, but Mance Rayder\u2019s hides were the shaggy <b>white pelts of snow bears</b>.</i></p><p><i>Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow is the snow bear and the rightful King of the 7Ks. (It is known.lol)</p><p>In this tent is <i><b>\u201ca pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens\u201d</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe good woman at the brazier,\u201d Mance Rayder went on,\u00a0\u201cis Dalla.\u201d The pregnant woman smiled <b>shyly</b>.\u00a0\u201c<b>Treat her like you would any queen, she is carrying my child.\u201d</b></i><br/></p></blockquote><p><b>So pregnant Lady Alyce Graceford, who appears to be a Sansa stand-in, from Sansa I, ASOS, and is married to one of the apple Fossoways, mirrors the shy Dalla, who is pregnant with a King\u2019s child and ought to be treated like a queen in Jon I ASOS. Lady Graceford also sits on the left of King Joffrey, who is a Jon foil, in Tyrion VIII, ASOS, the place usually occupied by the queen.</b></p><p>I like this subtext very much.</p><p>Also, Mance Rayder\u2019s physical description also has echoes of Jon\u2019s physique in it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king, nor even much a wildling</b>. He was of <b>middling height, slender, sharp-faced, with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey. </b>There was <b>no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver. He wore wool and leather, and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak, its long tears patched with faded red silk.</b></i><i><b>\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>-Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon is of middling height, slender and graceful and quick with eyes that hardly miss a thing. The black wool cloak patched with faded red silk is an obvious nod to the red and black colors of House Targaryen and thus to Jon. Hair gone mostly to grey is a node to the grey colors of House Stark. Again a nod to Jon, who is of the House Stark. The Black also denotes Jon and him being the black bastard of the Wall as part of the Night\u2019s Watch. The\u00a0\u201cnor even much a wildling\u201d may allude to Jon trying to infiltrate the wildlings and pretending to become a wildling in the process. However, he neither looks like one nor does he ends up becoming one.</p><p><i><b>Since all is subtext, I think this right here is actually meant to describe Jon and not Mance. The title of the King-beyond-the-Wall is such a clever way of calling Jon, the King, because if you think about it, when you are actually in the far North, past the Wall, and you are looking south, anything South of the Wall, can also be described\u00a0as beyond the wall.\u00a0And who is the rightful King of this side (Southern side) of the wall? Jon Snow of Houses Targaryen and Stark.\u00a0</b></i></p><p>Moving on, in this Jon I ASOS chapter, we first get to listen to the song The Dornishman\u2019s Wife, and that is being sung by\u00a0<b><i>\u201ca grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat cross-legged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing..\u201d</i></b></p><p>The grey-haired man in a cloak of black and red is another nod to Jon of the Houses Stark and Targaryen, who is also a Dornishman. A Dornishman\u2019s wife can also be called a Dornishwoman. In fact, one of the only two times the word <b>\u201cDornishwoman\u201d</b> shows up in the text in a POV chapter in ASOIAF, is in a Sansa chapter, <b>Sansa IV, ASOS</b>, talking about Ellaria Sand, paramour to the Red Viper of Dorne, Prince Oberyn. The other time is in the epilogue of ADWD.</p><p>Anyways, I think, there exists many subtextual clues that connect Jon and Sansa <i>via </i>apples or rather House Fossoway and may foreshadow them marrying and becoming King and Queen of the 7Ks and having a baby (or babies)!!! Here\u2019s to at least some of that in S8!</p><p>(I am a quarter way through ASOS, and hopefully, if I can find any more apple connections, I will add on to this post. If others find some, would love to read about them. One thing that always strikes me is the sheer number of parallels that exist between Sansa I and Jon I chapters in ASOS, later chapters of these two also have quite a lot of clues).\u00a0<br/></p>",

Sansa and Jon are the Maiden and Bear in the song.</p><p>Following this Sansa chapter is Jon I, ASOS and here is what we find\u2026</p><p>This is the chapter where Jon has been captured by the wildlings and taken to meet with Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall\u2026here is how his tent is described.</p><blockquote><p><i>There was no doubting which tent was the <b>king\u2019s</b>. It was thrice the size of the next largest he\u2019d seen, and he could hear music drifting from within. Like many of the lesser tents, it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on, but Mance Rayder\u2019s hides were the shaggy <b>white pelts of snow bears</b>.</i></p><p><i>Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow is the snow bear and the rightful King of the 7Ks. (It is known.lol)</p><p>In this tent is <i><b>\u201ca pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens\u201d</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe good woman at the brazier,\u201d Mance Rayder went on,\u00a0\u201cis Dalla.\u201d The pregnant woman smiled <b>shyly</b>.\u00a0\u201c<b>Treat her like you would any queen, she is carrying my child.\u201d</b></i><br></p></blockquote><p><b>So pregnant Lady Alyce Graceford, who appears to be a Sansa stand-in, from Sansa I, ASOS, and is married to one of the apple Fossoways, mirrors the shy Dalla, who is pregnant with a King\u2019s child and ought to be treated like a queen in Jon I ASOS. Lady Graceford also sits on the left of King Joffrey, who is a Jon foil, in Tyrion VIII, ASOS, the place usually occupied by the queen.</b></p><p>I like this subtext very much.</p><p>Also, Mance Rayder\u2019s physical description also has echoes of Jon\u2019s physique in it.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king, nor even much a wildling</b>. He was of <b>middling height, slender, sharp-faced, with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey. </b>There was <b>no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver. He wore wool and leather, and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak, its long tears patched with faded red silk.</b></i><i><b>\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>-Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon is of middling height, slender and graceful and quick with eyes that hardly miss a thing. The black wool cloak patched with faded red silk is an obvious nod to the red and black colors of House Targaryen and thus to Jon. Hair gone mostly to grey is a node to the grey colors of House Stark. Again a nod to Jon, who is of the House Stark. The Black also denotes Jon and him being the black bastard of the Wall as part of the Night\u2019s Watch. The\u00a0\u201cnor even much a wildling\u201d may allude to Jon trying to infiltrate the wildlings and pretending to become a wildling in the process. However, he neither looks like one nor does he ends up becoming one.</p><p><i><b>Since all is subtext, I think this right here is actually meant to describe Jon and not Mance. The title of the King-beyond-the-Wall is such a clever way of calling Jon, the King, because if you think about it, when you are actually in the far North, past the Wall, and you are looking south, anything South of the Wall, can also be described\u00a0as beyond the wall.\u00a0And who is the rightful King of this side (Southern side) of the wall? Jon Snow of Houses Targaryen and Stark.\u00a0</b></i></p><p>Moving on, in this Jon I ASOS chapter, we first get to listen to the song The Dornishman\u2019s Wife, and that is being sung by\u00a0<b><i>\u201ca grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat cross-legged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing..\u201d</i></b></p><p>The grey-haired man in a cloak of black and red is another nod to Jon of the Houses Stark and Targaryen, who is also a Dornishman. A Dornishman\u2019s wife can also be called a Dornishwoman. In fact, one of the only two times the word <b>\u201cDornishwoman\u201d</b> shows up in the text in a POV chapter in ASOIAF, is in a Sansa chapter, <b>Sansa IV, ASOS</b>, talking about Ellaria Sand, paramour to the Red Viper of Dorne, Prince Oberyn. The other time is in the epilogue of ADWD.</p><p>Anyways, I think, there exists many subtextual clues that connect Jon and Sansa <i>via </i>apples or rather House Fossoway and may foreshadow them marrying and becoming King and Queen of the 7Ks and having a baby (or babies)!!! Here\u2019s to at least some of that in S8!</p><p>(I am a quarter way through ASOS, and hopefully, if I can find any more apple connections, I will add on to this post. If others find some, would love to read about them. One thing that always strikes me is the sheer number of parallels that exist between Sansa I and Jon I chapters in ASOS, later chapters of these two also have quite a lot of clues).\u00a0<br></p>",

Her beauty in Tyrion VIII ASOS is described to be delicate, and kind of sounds similar to elegant and beautiful, all things that aptly describe Sansa.</p><p>But think how sweet and romantic this pair is, where the husband is feeding her morsels off his plate and they are drinking from the same cup&hellip;huh where have we seen that before????</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8ae090bc94ad8679a3bd9de2f5ae352f/tumblr_inline_pg1wjxvyU71s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe8bbf17b200ecd2765eecb578b5a7d3/tumblr_inline_pg1wk82HM91s6u549_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>YUP!! When they reunite in S0604 in Castle Black!! Oh apologies, did I mean Jon and Sansa??? Oops, I guess I did.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharing a drink is a very common wedding tradition in many cultures. The Scottish have the wedding Quaich ceremony where couples drink from a double-handed cup. I am sure other cultures have similar things but yeah sharing a drink is such a married people trope!</p><p>Plus I can totally imagine Jon doing all those things to a pregnant Sansa.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways back to Sansa I ASOS chapter, because there is more..</p><p>The song the Bear and the Maiden Fair is first sung in this chapter. Sansa and Jon are the Maiden and Bear in the song.</p><p>Following this Sansa chapter is Jon I, ASOS and here is what we find&hellip;</p><p>This is the chapter where Jon has been captured by the wildlings and taken to meet with Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall&hellip;here is how his tent is described.</p><blockquote><p><i>There was no doubting which tent was the <b>king&rsquo;s</b>. It was thrice the size of the next largest he&rsquo;d seen, and he could hear music drifting from within. Like many of the lesser tents, it was made of sewn hides with the fur still on, but Mance Rayder&rsquo;s hides were the shaggy <b>white pelts of snow bears</b>.</i></p><p><i>Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon Snow is the snow bear and the rightful King of the 7Ks. (It is known.lol)</p><p>In this tent is <i><b>&ldquo;a pregnant woman stood over a brazier cooking a brace of hens&rdquo;</b></i>.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;The good woman at the brazier,&rdquo; Mance Rayder went on,&nbsp;&ldquo;is Dalla.&rdquo; The pregnant woman smiled <b>shyly</b>.&nbsp;&ldquo;<b>Treat her like you would any queen, she is carrying my child.&rdquo;</b></i><br /></p></blockquote><p><b>So pregnant Lady Alyce Graceford, who appears to be a Sansa stand-in, from Sansa I, ASOS, and is married to one of the apple Fossoways, mirrors the shy Dalla, who is pregnant with a King&rsquo;s child and ought to be treated like a queen in Jon I ASOS. Lady Graceford also sits on the left of King Joffrey, who is a Jon foil, in Tyrion VIII, ASOS, the place usually occupied by the queen.</b></p><p>I like this subtext very much.</p><p>Also, Mance Rayder&rsquo;s physical description also has echoes of Jon&rsquo;s physique in it.</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>The King-beyond-the-Wall looked nothing like a king, nor even much a wildling</b>. He was of <b>middling height, slender, sharp-faced, with shrewd brown eyes and long brown hair that had gone mostly to grey. </b>There was <b>no crown on his head, no gold rings on his arms, no jewels at his throat, not even a gleam of silver. He wore wool and leather, and his only garment of note was his ragged black wool cloak, its long tears patched with faded red silk.</b></i><i><b>&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>-Jon I, ASOS</i></p></blockquote><p>Jon is of middling height, slender and graceful and quick with eyes that hardly miss a thing. The black wool cloak patched with faded red silk is an obvious nod to the red and black colors of House Targaryen and thus to Jon. Hair gone mostly to grey is a node to the grey colors of House Stark. Again a nod to Jon, who is of the House Stark. The Black also denotes Jon and him being the black bastard of the Wall as part of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. The&nbsp;&ldquo;nor even much a wildling&rdquo; may allude to Jon trying to infiltrate the wildlings and pretending to become a wildling in the process. However, he neither looks like one nor does he ends up becoming one.</p><p><i><b>Since all is subtext, I think this right here is actually meant to describe Jon and not Mance. The title of the King-beyond-the-Wall is such a clever way of calling Jon, the King, because if you think about it, when you are actually in the far North, past the Wall, and you are looking south, anything South of the Wall, can also be described&nbsp;as beyond the wall.&nbsp;And who is the rightful King of this side (Southern side) of the wall? Jon Snow of Houses Targaryen and Stark.&nbsp;</b></i></p><p>Moving on, in this Jon I ASOS chapter, we first get to listen to the song The Dornishman&rsquo;s Wife, and that is being sung by&nbsp;<b><i>&ldquo;a grey-haired man in a tattered cloak of black and red sat cross-legged on a pillow, playing a lute and singing..&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>The grey-haired man in a cloak of black and red is another nod to Jon of the Houses Stark and Targaryen, who is also a Dornishman. A Dornishman&rsquo;s wife can also be called a Dornishwoman. In fact, one of the only two times the word <b>&ldquo;Dornishwoman&rdquo;</b> shows up in the text in a POV chapter in ASOIAF, is in a Sansa chapter, <b>Sansa IV, ASOS</b>, talking about Ellaria Sand, paramour to the Red Viper of Dorne, Prince Oberyn. The other time is in the epilogue of ADWD.</p><p>Anyways, I think, there exists many subtextual clues that connect Jon and Sansa <i>via </i>apples or rather House Fossoway and may foreshadow them marrying and becoming King and Queen of the 7Ks and having a baby (or babies)!!! Here&rsquo;s to at least some of that in S8!</p><p>(I am a quarter way through ASOS, and hopefully, if I can find any more apple connections, I will add on to this post. If others find some, would love to read about them. One thing that always strikes me is the sheer number of parallels that exist between Sansa I and Jon I chapters in ASOS, later chapters of these two also have quite a lot of clues).&nbsp;<br /></p>",
