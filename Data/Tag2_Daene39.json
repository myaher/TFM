Can you do a fic where the reader saves Daenerys from Jon, stabbing him in the back right before he stabs Dany, and when she sees the knife in his hand she realizes that she must have been doing something wrong if the man she thought loved her was going to kill her. And she makes some changes? Thanks!<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Warning:</b> Death of a major character, angst, cursing.</p><p><b>Pairing:</b> Daenerys x Reader</p><p><b>A/N: </b>I tried to be as realistic as I could with this, hopefully, I got Arya and Sansa\u2019s reactions done well enough. I hope you enjoy this!</p><p><br/></p><!-- more --><p>Ashes burned your nostrils as you ran up the steps towards the castle, pushing past Dothraki soldiers. You had just finished talking to Tyrion and you knew what Jon was about to do. You couldn\u2019t let it happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice rung in your ears as you neared the entrance, where Drogon had slowly begun to wake.</p><p>\u201cYou too?\u201d You panted, looking down at the girl. She wanted your queen dead as well? Had they all been planning this the entire time? Your stomach churned and you felt sick. What if they were planning on killing you as well?</p><p>She just turned away and looked to the ashes raining down from the sky, sighing. \u201cIt should have been done earlier. And if you\u2019d seen what I\u2019ve seen here, you\u2019d think the same.\u201d</p><p>You knew Daenerys had gotten a little lost on the way, it was true. But she was still in there somewhere, you just needed to figure out how to get her back. </p><p>You pushed past Arya and ran inside, having to duck under Drogon\u2019s head. Arya would have followed you if she didn\u2019t think Daenerys was already dead. And you thought so too. </p><p>When you burst through the doors, your dress tattered from catching on the ruins of the city, you saw you hadn\u2019t been too late. Daenerys and Jon were in an embrace, you heard him speaking to her in a hushed tone. </p><p>Maybe Tyrion was wrong, maybe Jon wasn\u2019t going to do what you thought he would. But then you saw his hand reaching for his knife. </p><p>It was true. The last man Daenerys thought she could trust, the man she loved, reaching for the knife he\u2019d end her life with. She risked her life multiple times for him, one of her dragons dying in the process. She helped defeat his greatest enemy, saving him and Westeros from the White Walkers. And this is how he thanked her for it?</p><p>Your feet couldn\u2019t carry you fast enough. You could see as his hand wrapped around the hilt of his knife, slowly pulling it from his belt. </p><p>In the distance, you could hear stone rumbling as Drogon shifted in his place beneath the castle. He knew his mother was in danger, but he wouldn\u2019t be quick enough. You had to save her for him. </p><p>The sound of steel pushing through skin was sickening. The sound of her gasp was even worse. She looked down between her and Jon, her eyes widening and her lips parting. She fought to say something but no words came out. She took in the sight before her, blood dripping onto the ground between them, Jon\u2019s hand on his knife, and your horrified expression behind him. </p><p>His knife fell from his shaking fingers, clattering on the stone floor and he took a few steps back. He bumped into you and you stepped aside, drawing your dagger from his back. Outside, the flap of Drogon\u2019s wings could be heard as he flew up to his mother.</p><p>Seeing Jon, a man you once had so much admiration for, fall dying onto the floor in a pool of blood, it was shattering, to say the least. He shouldn\u2019t die like this. He deserved better, he was doing what he thought was right, but you knew it was the only way to protect Daenerys. </p><p>Daenerys fell to her knees beside him, tears burning her eyes as she watched him die. You watched as his lips fumbled to make words. What else did he have to say? You clenched your teeth and looked away, wishing it didn\u2019t have to end like this, while wondering what was next. </p><p>When Arya and Sansa found out they\u2019d want you and Daenerys dead. When Greyworm found out Jon tried to kill Daenerys he\u2019d want every Stark dead.</p><p>He took his last breath and his eyes hazed over, his head gently rolling to the side. Daenerys choked back a sob and sniffled, closing her eyes. Not only did she have to watch him die, but she knew he died trying to end her life. </p><p>\u201cKhaleesi, we need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I become a monster?\u201d She glanced up at you with eyes full of pain. You\u2019d never seen her like this. Not when Missandei was murdered, not when Jorah died in her arms. This was much worse. The man she thought she would marry and rule the Seven Kingdoms with had tried to kill her. And in such an awful way. </p><p>You knelt down beside her. \u201cYou got a little lost, Khaleesi. But anyone would. You\u2019ve seen two of your children die. Your two closest friends killed. You were doing what you thought was right. But now, you need to do what is truly right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d </p><p>Drogon could be heard climbing into the room, knocking over brick and rubble. Daenerys turned to look at him and she forced a smile before looking back down to Jon\u2019s body. </p><p>\u201cYou need to let Tyrion have a trial. And you need to prove that you\u2019ll be a good queen. Begin building the city, and let Sansa have the North. Don\u2019t ask her to bend the knee to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained on Jon and she slowly nodded. \u201cHow do we tell them about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them what happened. I\u2019ll be the one put on trial. They can judge me along with Tyrion.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys shook her head, shifting on her knees closer to you. \u201cI will not have one of my last friends put on trial. Sansa and Arya will want you killed for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Drogon\u2019s nostrils flared as he smelt Jon\u2019s blood. Confused chirps sounded from him and he looked from you to Daenerys, trying to figure out what happened. For a moment you were worried he would turn on you since Jon was a Targaryen and you killed him. But he slid forward towards Daenerys to provide her comfort, nuzzling her with his snout.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to be done. You need to show them you won&rsquo;t just pardon your friends, you need to let them see you know true justice.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>You followed the unsullied through the halls, Greyworm at your side and Tyrion behind you. The silence was thick in the air, ringing so hard in your ears you thought you\u2019d go deaf. Ahead of you, Daenerys, Sansa, Arya, Yara, Ser Davos, Sam and a group of other people you didn\u2019t recognize. The Stark girls looked furious, Arya ready to jump out of her seat and kill you herself. If it wasn\u2019t for Greyworm beside you and Drogon crouched behind the tent you were sure you\u2019d be dead.</p><p>When you came to a stop in front of the group you swallowed hard. What were you going to say? What were they going to say?</p><p>\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d Yara was the first to speak, referring to you. </p><p>\u201cShe killed Jon Snow.\u201d Sansa snapped while Arya glared daggers into you. </p><p>\u201cShe saved our Queen from a man who was about to kill her.\u201d She responded, keeping steady eye contact with Sansa. \u201cShe was doing her duty. She shouldn\u2019t be on trial, she should be given a damn castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyrion, please step forward,\u201d Daenerys spoke, her calm voice a pleasant change from the two. You kept your eyes on the ground as Tyrion walked forward. His judgment would be much kinder than yours.</p><p>\u201cYou will be pardoned for your acts of treason against me.\u201d The words surprised everyone, especially the man on trial. He looked up and furrowed his brows, not knowing what to say.</p><p>From your spot you chewed on your bottom lip, barely listening to the rest of the trial. You only looked up when Daenerys called your name.</p><p>\u201cAs my hand, Tyrion, what do you suggest I do with her?\u201d You missed a lot. Tyrion must have been made hand to the queen again. </p><p>\u201cYou need to execute her.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was full of venom. \u201cDo it. With your dragon. She killed your lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, please,\u201d Tyrion spoke the voice of reason, \u201cNo more killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her dead. It\u2019s the only way justice can be served.\u201d</p><p>Sam watched from the sidelines, torn between wanting you punished for killing his best friend and knowing you were only doing your duty. You had committed no crimes. Everyone knew it, even the Stark girls.</p><p>\u201cIf we kill her for saving the Queen then we should kill Samwell for reading books. She should not be punished for this.\u201d Tyrion hated saying it but he knew there was nothing you could be charged with. </p><p>\u201cThen, you will be pardoned.\u201d Daenerys stood up and the Unsullied guards that stood beside her stepped forward. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>Arya hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off you the entire time. You could feel her eyes on you, and you knew in her mind she was killing you in a thousand different ways.</p><p>\u201cThe North won\u2019t bend the knee to you. You\u2019ll be Queen of the Six Kingdoms, and if you oppose to this, it will come to war.\u201d Sansa had already made her mind up, there would be no talking her out of it.</p><p>Daenerys looked to you and you gave a small nod that went unnoticed to anyone who didn\u2019t know you had talked her into this. She sighed and turned to Sansa, nodding. </p><p>You smiled at her and soon the meeting was over. The following weeks were much better than the months before. You rebuilt Kings Landing with more gardens, feeding what remained of the population. For once they went to bed with full stomachs. </p><p>The ports were rebuilt and there were more houses made so no one would need to sleep outside. Along with that, you donated every piece of gold in your name to your people, ensuring any problems they had under Cersei were no more. They were clothed in proper garments, could buy their own horses, they all had a place to sleep and as much food as they needed. For once, all felt right in the city.</p><p>You took comfort knowing that if Jon Snow could see Daenerys now, he would be proud of her.</p>",

She took in the sight before her, blood dripping onto the ground between them, Jon\u2019s hand on his knife, and your horrified expression behind him. </p><p>His knife fell from his shaking fingers, clattering on the stone floor and he took a few steps back. He bumped into you and you stepped aside, drawing your dagger from his back. Outside, the flap of Drogon\u2019s wings could be heard as he flew up to his mother.</p><p>Seeing Jon, a man you once had so much admiration for, fall dying onto the floor in a pool of blood, it was shattering, to say the least. He shouldn\u2019t die like this. He deserved better, he was doing what he thought was right, but you knew it was the only way to protect Daenerys. </p><p>Daenerys fell to her knees beside him, tears burning her eyes as she watched him die. You watched as his lips fumbled to make words. What else did he have to say? You clenched your teeth and looked away, wishing it didn\u2019t have to end like this, while wondering what was next. </p><p>When Arya and Sansa found out they\u2019d want you and Daenerys dead. When Greyworm found out Jon tried to kill Daenerys he\u2019d want every Stark dead.</p><p>He took his last breath and his eyes hazed over, his head gently rolling to the side. Daenerys choked back a sob and sniffled, closing her eyes. Not only did she have to watch him die, but she knew he died trying to end her life. </p><p>\u201cKhaleesi, we need to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I become a monster?\u201d She glanced up at you with eyes full of pain. You\u2019d never seen her like this. Not when Missandei was murdered, not when Jorah died in her arms. This was much worse. The man she thought she would marry and rule the Seven Kingdoms with had tried to kill her. And in such an awful way. </p><p>You knelt down beside her. \u201cYou got a little lost, Khaleesi. But anyone would. You\u2019ve seen two of your children die. Your two closest friends killed. You were doing what you thought was right. But now, you need to do what is truly right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d </p><p>Drogon could be heard climbing into the room, knocking over brick and rubble. Daenerys turned to look at him and she forced a smile before looking back down to Jon\u2019s body. </p><p>\u201cYou need to let Tyrion have a trial. And you need to prove that you\u2019ll be a good queen. Begin building the city, and let Sansa have the North. Don\u2019t ask her to bend the knee to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes remained on Jon and she slowly nodded. \u201cHow do we tell them about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them what happened. I\u2019ll be the one put on trial. They can judge me along with Tyrion.\u201d </p><p>Daenerys shook her head, shifting on her knees closer to you. \u201cI will not have one of my last friends put on trial. Sansa and Arya will want you killed for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Drogon\u2019s nostrils flared as he smelt Jon\u2019s blood. Confused chirps sounded from him and he looked from you to Daenerys, trying to figure out what happened. For a moment you were worried he would turn on you since Jon was a Targaryen and you killed him. But he slid forward towards Daenerys to provide her comfort, nuzzling her with his snout.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to be done. You need to show them you won\u2019t just pardon your friends, you need to let them see you know true justice.\u201d</p><p>***</p><p>You followed the unsullied through the halls, Greyworm at your side and Tyrion behind you. The silence was thick in the air, ringing so hard in your ears you thought you\u2019d go deaf. Ahead of you, Daenerys, Sansa, Arya, Yara, Ser Davos, Sam and a group of other people you didn\u2019t recognize. The Stark girls looked furious, Arya ready to jump out of her seat and kill you herself. If it wasn\u2019t for Greyworm beside you and Drogon crouched behind the tent you were sure you\u2019d be dead.</p><p>When you came to a stop in front of the group you swallowed hard. What were you going to say? What were they going to say?</p><p>\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d Yara was the first to speak, referring to you. </p><p>\u201cShe killed Jon Snow.\u201d Sansa snapped while Arya glared daggers into you. </p><p>\u201cShe saved our Queen from a man who was about to kill her.\u201d She responded, keeping steady eye contact with Sansa. \u201cShe was doing her duty. She shouldn\u2019t be on trial, she should be given a damn castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyrion, please step forward,\u201d Daenerys spoke, her calm voice a pleasant change from the two. You kept your eyes on the ground as Tyrion walked forward. His judgment would be much kinder than yours.</p><p>\u201cYou will be pardoned for your acts of treason against me.\u201d The words surprised everyone, especially the man on trial. He looked up and furrowed his brows, not knowing what to say.</p><p>From your spot you chewed on your bottom lip, barely listening to the rest of the trial. You only looked up when Daenerys called your name.</p><p>\u201cAs my hand, Tyrion, what do you suggest I do with her?\u201d You missed a lot. Tyrion must have been made hand to the queen again. </p><p>\u201cYou need to execute her.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice was full of venom. \u201cDo it. With your dragon. She killed your lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArya, please,\u201d Tyrion spoke the voice of reason, \u201cNo more killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her dead. It\u2019s the only way justice can be served.\u201d</p><p>Sam watched from the sidelines, torn between wanting you punished for killing his best friend and knowing you were only doing your duty. You had committed no crimes. Everyone knew it, even the Stark girls.</p><p>\u201cIf we kill her for saving the Queen then we should kill Samwell for reading books. She should not be punished for this.\u201d Tyrion hated saying it but he knew there was nothing you could be charged with. </p><p>\u201cThen, you will be pardoned.\u201d Daenerys stood up and the Unsullied guards that stood beside her stepped forward. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>Arya hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off you the entire time. You could feel her eyes on you, and you knew in her mind she was killing you in a thousand different ways.</p><p>\u201cThe North won\u2019t bend the knee to you. You\u2019ll be Queen of the Six Kingdoms, and if you oppose to this, it will come to war.\u201d Sansa had already made her mind up, there would be no talking her out of it.</p><p>Daenerys looked to you and you gave a small nod that went unnoticed to anyone who didn\u2019t know you had talked her into this. She sighed and turned to Sansa, nodding. </p><p>You smiled at her and soon the meeting was over. The following weeks were much better than the months before. You rebuilt Kings Landing with more gardens, feeding what remained of the population. For once they went to bed with full stomachs. </p><p>The ports were rebuilt and there were more houses made so no one would need to sleep outside. Along with that, you donated every piece of gold in your name to your people, ensuring any problems they had under Cersei were no more. They were clothed in proper garments, could buy their own horses, they all had a place to sleep and as much food as they needed. For once, all felt right in the city.</p><p>You took comfort knowing that if Jon Snow could see Daenerys now, he would be proud of her.</p>",

You had just finished talking to Tyrion and you knew what Jon was about to do. You couldn\u2019t let it happen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late.\u201d Arya\u2019s voice rung in your ears as you neared the entrance, where Drogon had slowly begun to wake.</p><p>\u201cYou too?\u201d You panted, looking down at the girl. She wanted your queen dead as well? Had they all been planning this the entire time? Your stomach churned and you felt sick.

Arya would have followed you if she didn\u2019t think Daenerys was already dead. And you thought so too. </p><p>When you burst through the doors, your dress tattered from catching on the ruins of the city, you saw you hadn\u2019t been too late. Daenerys and Jon were in an embrace, you heard him speaking to her in a hushed tone. </p><p>Maybe Tyrion was wrong, maybe Jon wasn\u2019t going to do what you thought he would. But then you saw his hand reaching for his knife. </p><p>It was true. The last man Daenerys thought she could trust, the man she loved, reaching for the knife he\u2019d end her life with. She risked her life multiple times for him, one of her dragons dying in the process. She helped defeat his greatest enemy, saving him and Westeros from the White Walkers.

He knew his mother was in danger, but he wouldn\u2019t be quick enough. You had to save her for him. </p><p>The sound of steel pushing through skin was sickening.

They can judge me along with Tyrion.&rdquo; </p><p>Daenerys shook her head, shifting on her knees closer to you. &ldquo;I will not have one of my last friends put on trial. Sansa and Arya will want you killed for what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>Drogon&rsquo;s nostrils flared as he smelt Jon&rsquo;s blood. Confused chirps sounded from him and he looked from you to Daenerys, trying to figure out what happened. For a moment you were worried he would turn on you since Jon was a Targaryen and you killed him. But he slid forward towards Daenerys to provide her comfort, nuzzling her with his snout.</p><p>&ldquo;It needs to be done. You need to show them you won&rsquo;t just pardon your friends, you need to let them see you know true justice.&rdquo;</p><p>***</p><p>You followed the unsullied through the halls, Greyworm at your side and Tyrion behind you. The silence was thick in the air, ringing so hard in your ears you thought you&rsquo;d go deaf. Ahead of you, Daenerys, Sansa, Arya, Yara, Ser Davos, Sam and a group of other people you didn&rsquo;t recognize. The Stark girls looked furious, Arya ready to jump out of her seat and kill you herself. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Greyworm beside you and Drogon crouched behind the tent you were sure you&rsquo;d be dead.</p><p>When you came to a stop in front of the group you swallowed hard. What were you going to say? What were they going to say?</p><p>&ldquo;Why is she here?&rdquo; Yara was the first to speak, referring to you. </p><p>&ldquo;She killed Jon Snow.&rdquo; Sansa snapped while Arya glared daggers into you. </p><p>&ldquo;She saved our Queen from a man who was about to kill her.&rdquo; She responded, keeping steady eye contact with Sansa. &ldquo;She was doing her duty. She shouldn&rsquo;t be on trial, she should be given a damn castle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tyrion, please step forward,&rdquo; Daenerys spoke, her calm voice a pleasant change from the two. You kept your eyes on the ground as Tyrion walked forward. His judgment would be much kinder than yours.</p><p>&ldquo;You will be pardoned for your acts of treason against me.&rdquo; The words surprised everyone, especially the man on trial. He looked up and furrowed his brows, not knowing what to say.</p><p>From your spot you chewed on your bottom lip, barely listening to the rest of the trial. You only looked up when Daenerys called your name.</p><p>&ldquo;As my hand, Tyrion, what do you suggest I do with her?&rdquo; You missed a lot. Tyrion must have been made hand to the queen again. </p><p>&ldquo;You need to execute her.&rdquo; Arya&rsquo;s voice was full of venom. &ldquo;Do it. With your dragon. She killed your lover.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arya, please,&rdquo; Tyrion spoke the voice of reason, &ldquo;No more killing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want her dead. It&rsquo;s the only way justice can be served.&rdquo;</p><p>Sam watched from the sidelines, torn between wanting you punished for killing his best friend and knowing you were only doing your duty. You had committed no crimes. Everyone knew it, even the Stark girls.</p><p>&ldquo;If we kill her for saving the Queen then we should kill Samwell for reading books. She should not be punished for this.&rdquo; Tyrion hated saying it but he knew there was nothing you could be charged with. </p><p>&ldquo;Then, you will be pardoned.&rdquo; Daenerys stood up and the Unsullied guards that stood beside her stepped forward. &ldquo;Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p><p>Arya hadn&rsquo;t taken her eyes off you the entire time. You could feel her eyes on you, and you knew in her mind she was killing you in a thousand different ways.</p><p>&ldquo;The North won&rsquo;t bend the knee to you. You&rsquo;ll be Queen of the Six Kingdoms, and if you oppose to this, it will come to war.&rdquo; Sansa had already made her mind up, there would be no talking her out of it.</p><p>Daenerys looked to you and you gave a small nod that went unnoticed to anyone who didn&rsquo;t know you had talked her into this. She sighed and turned to Sansa, nodding. </p><p>You smiled at her and soon the meeting was over. The following weeks were much better than the months before. You rebuilt Kings Landing with more gardens, feeding what remained of the population. For once they went to bed with full stomachs. </p><p>The ports were rebuilt and there were more houses made so no one would need to sleep outside. Along with that, you donated every piece of gold in your name to your people, ensuring any problems they had under Cersei were no more. They were clothed in proper garments, could buy their own horses, they all had a place to sleep and as much food as they needed. For once, all felt right in the city.</p><p>You took comfort knowing that if Jon Snow could see Daenerys now, he would be proud of her.</p>",

Can you do a fic where the reader saves Daenerys from Jon, stabbing him in the back right before he stabs Dany, and when she sees the knife in his hand she realizes that she must have been doing something wrong if the man she thought loved her was going to kill her. And she makes some changes? Thanks!<b><br /></b></p>\n<p><b>Warning:</b> Death of a major character, angst, cursing.</p>\n<p><b>Pairing:</b> Daenerys x Reader</p>\n<p><b>A/N: </b>I tried to be as realistic as I could with this, hopefully, I got Arya and Sansa&rsquo;s reactions done well enough.

Afraid of dropping her, he gathers his feet closer to his body and tightens his grip, securing her limp body.\u00a0</p><p>As Drogon flies east, flapping his wings and riding the wind, he scrambles to gather the pieces of what transpired in The City of Mother\u2019s Death. He heard the screams and wails of dying men, terrified men, realizing their mortality is upon them as he opens his mouth and spits his fire, sending the smell of cooked meat wafting into the air. Mother had been on his back, and her fury and sorrow fed his. He sensed her loss as acutely as he felt his own: for the man Jorah Mormont, and, more recently, for the woman Missandei - and for Rhaegal.\u00a0</p><p>Jorah. He was dead. Drogon has always been fond of Jorah. He could see that Mother loved Jorah well, and the man has ever been kind to him. Drogon needs only his family, his mother and his brothers, but if he included anyone else in that circle it would have been Jorah. He remembers clearly his confusion to find Mother on the ground, clutching Jorah and sobbing. And then the stench of death. Then the sorrow. And he knew Jorah Mormont was dead.</p><p>And Missandei. Dead too. Mother\u2019s dearest, closest friend. When her head was separated from her shoulders, Drogon felt Mother\u2019s devastation and ruin, stabbing cleanly through his chest as it had hers. And his own shock. Why Missandei? Missandei was good. Missandei was kind. Missandei was lively. Missandei made Mother happy, and when they were younger, her stroking made Drogon and his brothers hiss with satisfaction. Missandei was like his mother\u2019s sister, and she was gentle. Why her?\u00a0</p><p>Rhaegal. And <i>Rhaegal</i>. And his brother, his annoying, arrogant, sly brother. Drogon remembers play-fighting with Rhaegal and Viserion as hatchlings, pouncing and hissing and screeching, as Mother watched them and smiled. Rhaegal was always mischievous, he recalls. And tricky. You could never trust Rhaegal. He would play-surrender and then lunge again. But Rhaegal is gone too, struck in the chest with a giant man-claw, plummeting from the sky and vanishing beneath the waves.\u00a0</p><p>Pain fueled only rage, as it had Mother\u2019s. And as it had - still <i>did </i>- Drogon\u2019s, as he unleashed his fire and burned the stinking city to the ground. He sensed Mother\u2019s anger at the place, and it sang with his, his anger being her anger and her anger being his anger. <i>You will all burn. You wronged Mother. You killed Missandei. You will burn. </i>They had been one, melding together into a force of nature bent on destroying all that wronged them.</p><p>But then Drogon had lost Mother, and when he found her again, she was still. The stench of death hit him, and he had known that Mother was dead. And the man standing before her - Jon Snow - he was the one to do so.</p><p>But why? Was Jon Snow not his mother\u2019s chosen mate? Drogon remembers watching them in the icy cliffs of the north, before the not-dead came marching. He remembers smelling the scent of Jon Snow all over his mother and flaring his nostrils in dislike. They had copulated. Multiple times, in fact. So why? Mates were for life, and it was heinous, the height of treachery, to betray each other. So why was it that Jon Snow had thrust the small man-claw into Mother&rsquo;s chest? Mother did nothing wrong. Avenging her companions - was it not something men did? Was it something particular to Mother only among humans?\u00a0</p><p>Drogon does not know.\u00a0He is confused.</p><p>And frankly, he does not want to know. From the moment she sailed with Jon Snow, Mother has lost and lost and lost. She has lost Jorah Mormont. She has lost Rhaegal. She has lost Missandei. And even barring that, Drogon senses it when she is in distress, and she constantly was after their arrival at the Stone Castle in the North. Jon Snow has hurt her, time and time again, and in the end, he has killed her. Drogon wants no excuses. He wants no reasons. He needs none of Jon Snow\u2019s justifications, nor those of any cooperating with him.\u00a0</p><p>Drogon clutches Mother tighter to his body.\u00a0</p><p>He is headed east - the far east, to the place of ebony stone and shadow. Something there calls to him. Drogon cannot name what it is, but his instinct bids him to do so, and his instinct has not failed him yet. If he goes there, he feels that his Mother, dead and limp in his claws, will be dead no longer.\u00a0</p><p>Drogon flaps his wings in the air to halt his progress and hover, and gazes back toward the Stone Castle in the North and City of Mother\u2019s Death. He bares his teeth in disgust. They are full of leeches, parasites, who used then betrayed and discarded his mother\u2019s people, his mother, his brothers, as if they are nothing but beasts of burden. He does not remember all their names, but he recalls all their faces. Jon Snow. Tyrion Lannister. The three-eyed-not-man. The tall red-haired northern woman. They are traitors, all of them.\u00a0</p><p>And if they think they can survive betraying Mother, Drogon will ensure that they are wrong. No one who has ever betrayed Mother has survived. He would have burned them himself, then and there before he took off with Mother\u2019s body, but he refrains, for he wants his mother to have that honor herself. The traitors deserve it. Mother deserves it.</p><p>He turns his gaze back eastward and takes off once more. The quicker he arrives, the better. Then Mother can wake once more. Then she can recuperate. Then she can gather her strength.\u00a0</p><p>Then she can return. And it will be with fire and blood. The traitors, they will die.</p><p>They will burn.\u00a0</p>",

Missandei made Mother happy, and when they were younger, her stroking made Drogon and his brothers hiss with satisfaction. Missandei was like his mother&rsquo;s sister, and she was gentle. Why her?&nbsp;</p><p>Rhaegal. And <i>Rhaegal</i>. And his brother, his annoying, arrogant, sly brother. Drogon remembers play-fighting with Rhaegal and Viserion as hatchlings, pouncing and hissing and screeching, as Mother watched them and smiled. Rhaegal was always mischievous, he recalls. And tricky. You could never trust Rhaegal. He would play-surrender and then lunge again. But Rhaegal is gone too, struck in the chest with a giant man-claw, plummeting from the sky and vanishing beneath the waves.&nbsp;</p><p>Pain fueled only rage, as it had Mother&rsquo;s. And as it had - still <i>did </i>- Drogon&rsquo;s, as he unleashed his fire and burned the stinking city to the ground. He sensed Mother&rsquo;s anger at the place, and it sang with his, his anger being her anger and her anger being his anger. <i>You will all burn. You wronged Mother. You killed Missandei. You will burn. </i>They had been one, melding together into a force of nature bent on destroying all that wronged them.</p><p>But then Drogon had lost Mother, and when he found her again, she was still. The stench of death hit him, and he had known that Mother was dead. And the man standing before her - Jon Snow - he was the one to do so.</p><p>But why? Was Jon Snow not his mother&rsquo;s chosen mate? Drogon remembers watching them in the icy cliffs of the north, before the not-dead came marching. He remembers smelling the scent of Jon Snow all over his mother and flaring his nostrils in dislike. They had copulated. Multiple times, in fact. So why? Mates were for life, and it was heinous, the height of treachery, to betray each other. So why was it that Jon Snow had thrust the small man-claw into Mother&rsquo;s chest? Mother did nothing wrong. Avenging her companions - was it not something men did? Was it something particular to Mother only among humans?&nbsp;</p><p>Drogon does not know.&nbsp;He is confused.</p><p>And frankly, he does not want to know. From the moment she sailed with Jon Snow, Mother has lost and lost and lost. She has lost Jorah Mormont. She has lost Rhaegal. She has lost Missandei. And even barring that, Drogon senses it when she is in distress, and she constantly was after their arrival at the Stone Castle in the North. Jon Snow has hurt her, time and time again, and in the end, he has killed her. Drogon wants no excuses. He wants no reasons. He needs none of Jon Snow&rsquo;s justifications, nor those of any cooperating with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Drogon clutches Mother tighter to his body.&nbsp;</p><p>He is headed east - the far east, to the place of ebony stone and shadow. Something there calls to him. Drogon cannot name what it is, but his instinct bids him to do so, and his instinct has not failed him yet. If he goes there, he feels that his Mother, dead and limp in his claws, will be dead no longer.&nbsp;</p><p>Drogon flaps his wings in the air to halt his progress and hover, and gazes back toward the Stone Castle in the North and City of Mother&rsquo;s Death. He bares his teeth in disgust. They are full of leeches, parasites, who used then betrayed and discarded his mother&rsquo;s people, his mother, his brothers, as if they are nothing but beasts of burden. He does not remember all their names, but he recalls all their faces. Jon Snow. Tyrion Lannister. The three-eyed-not-man. The tall red-haired northern woman. They are traitors, all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>And if they think they can survive betraying Mother, Drogon will ensure that they are wrong. No one who has ever betrayed Mother has survived. He would have burned them himself, then and there before he took off with Mother&rsquo;s body, but he refrains, for he wants his mother to have that honor herself. The traitors deserve it. Mother deserves it.</p><p>He turns his gaze back eastward and takes off once more. The quicker he arrives, the better. Then Mother can wake once more. Then she can recuperate. Then she can gather her strength.&nbsp;</p><p>Then she can return. And it will be with fire and blood. The traitors, they will die.</p><p>They will burn.&nbsp;</p></p>",

Are you disappointed? Were you surprised? Have you taken note of the\u00a0feminist criticism\u00a0of this?</b></p><p>I read these scripts coming on to two years ago now. When I did, I took a very long walk around London in a daze, not quite knowing how to digest the news. Now, finally, people are going, \u201cOh, now we understand why this season hit you hard.\u201d I had no idea what to expect for this last season. I hoped for some juicy things to get into, as I always do for each season, but I didn\u2019t see this coming. Throughout the show, there have been these glorious moments of Daenerys taking on a very strong role in a battle or in a decision to be made. There were these wonderful moments when she takes control, and it\u2019s really liberating and beautiful. She frees people, she kills the baddies, and it feels good.</p><p>And, I must admit, I was sitting tentatively on that chair thinking, How long is this going to last? Everyone was saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t she great? She\u2019s our savior,\u00a0Mhysa.\u201d It\u2019s been beautiful and amazing, but I\u2019ve been looking over my shoulder the entire time while everyone else gets a more human\u2014for want of a better word\u2014story line. They do good things. They do bad things. They do silly things. They do brilliant things. They fall in love. They break hearts. Daenerys has quite consistently had this road to salvation, and she\u2019s been sitting atop a very safe mountain.</p><p>I remember the boys\u2014our writers and showrunners\u2014telling me that Daenerys\u2019s arc is that of Lawrence of Arabia. I watched \u201cLawrence of Arabia,\u201d and I was, like, \u201cGreat, cool. He\u2019s brilliant. He survived, and it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d But then you remember how that movie ended, with Lawrence\u2019s disintegration. I didn\u2019t quite put those two things together. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to see it coming because I care about Daenerys too much.</p><p><b>Can you talk about that a little more, how Daenerys\u2019s arc is like Lawrence of Arabia\u2019s life?</b></p><p>Well, fundamentally, he\u2019s brought in as a savior. He goes in and fights for the people, but then, ultimately, it\u2019s a story about how power corrupts absolutely. You see power turn this man wild and mad. He can\u2019t see anymore through the haze, the giddy highs, of being in charge. And that\u2019s what Daenerys experiences. And yet I care for her so much. She\u2019s been a part of me for so long that, in reading this script, I did what any actor is told to do and would do. You have to agree with your character. If you don\u2019t agree with your character, then you shouldn\u2019t take the job.</p><p>I really just had to sit there and wrestle with how I could make good on what they had written. Because that\u2019s her. They are the writers. They have made this woman, and I\u2019m going to take on what it is and try and interpret that to my best ability. Now, when I showed the first glimmer of coldness, in Season 1, when Khal Drogo kills my brother, Viserys Targaryen\u2014Jason [Momoa] kills Harry Lloyd\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.</p><p><b>A glorious moment.</b></p><p>It was the first time I inhabited this kind of steely serenity, this calm, quiet. So that\u2019s where I\u2019ve gone with her. She\u2019s so completely in control of this part of her that it actually calms her.</p><p>I\u2019ve always wanted to warm her up, because I\u2019ve seen the more feminine aspects of her. I\u2019m not saying that as anything derogatory at all. But she was a child. She was sold. She grew up around a life that was written for her. She was on the run her entire life. She lost every single person that meant anything to her. She was brought up by a brother who was telling her why her family had been taken from her, because people haven\u2019t allowed them to inhabit the Iron Throne.</p><p>So that\u2019s always been her mission and, at every turn, she\u2019s sacrificed everything. She sacrificed being a mother. She sacrificed love. She sacrificed happiness. She sacrificed an easy life. She sacrificed friends. She sacrificed everything to be the ruler that she believes herself to be. And, with each next step up that ladder\u2014with each next mass killing, with each bad person that she kills, for every ten good people that she saves, for putting her friends and her lovers in harm\u2019s way\u2014each step up that ladder has just solidified her course towards sitting on top of the Iron Throne. Because then it will all have been worth it.</p><p>Every time I was faced with Daenerys having to do something pretty cold, like a mass killing, it was always with this thought that she\u2019s headed toward her destiny. She\u2019s gone too far to turn back now. So then she finally falls in love with someone who is her age, someone appropriate, who seems to love her back, who seems to be a good guy. The fact that she\u2019s his aunt is just kind of by the by! And then it seems almost too good to be true. Even when she finally gets to relax for the first time, she\u2019s thinking, My God, I can have it all. I can have my love. I can have my career. I can have the prospect of a family. I can have it all.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But no! I fucking can\u2019t.</p><p>She encounters the dark side of that. She\u2019s not wanted. She\u2019s not loved completely there. And so she gives herself to Jon [Snow] entirely, and she gives him many, many choices, many options to see clearly with open eyes. And she\u2019s asking him, \u201cIf you wanted to be with me, then let me fulfill this.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I know I can be a good leader, so let\u2019s do this together. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t. And that disappointment is the final thing that breaks her as a human being, because, my God, all she\u2019s known is pain, sacrifice, and abuse. All she\u2019s known is people turning on her, people betraying her, and she\u2019s completely alone. And so, with all of that, I think that it brings us to the moment where she\u2019s on top of the dragon and making that choice.</p><p><b>When you were sitting on the green-screen dragon in that scene as it began, what were you thinking and feeling to bring that moment about realistically?</b></p><p>On the motor unit, riding a dragon, it takes a week to shoot a minute\u2019s worth\u2014sometimes two weeks. And it\u2019s very hard to engage your acting muscles when you\u2019re, like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to be aware of the dragon breathing.\u201d</p><p>But we wanted very much to show this moment of humanity and choice, a real person deciding to do the thing that they know will only harm themselves, but they can\u2019t help it. I think it\u2019s an incredibly human trait. We all have that thing, whether it\u2019s binging on chocolate or drinking seventeen bottles of wine or having an affair. Whatever it is, everyone\u2019s got this dark part of themselves that no one really likes inhabiting. It\u2019s something we all really struggle with.</p><p><b>A lot of well-known series have ended in a way that\u2019s either mystifying or disappointing.</b></p><p>I always knew that the show was never going to satisfy everyone. I watched and loved too many television series to ever think that would be possible. The stories are too vast, the characters too complex. The show is, in a certain way, divisive: \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Also, if you\u2019re pleasing everyone, then it\u2019s probably quite tepid. But to me it seemed like the only way it\u00a0<i>could</i>\u00a0end.</p><p><b>Didn\u2019t you want it to end more triumphantly for Daenerys?</b></p><p>I\u2019m not sure it could. Even for a part that I\u2019ve given so much to and I\u2019ve felt so much for, and for a character that\u2019s seen and lived through so much, I don\u2019t know that there was any other way. But it was a shocker to read.</p><p><b>Which part was a shocker?</b></p><p>The final moment sort of passed me by when I first read it. And then I suddenly was \u201cWait a second.\u201d And I went back and I reread it, and I was, like, \u201cOh, great. Excellent. What I read was correct.\u201d But then I had to wrestle with that. The actual acting of it was hilariously long and arduous, but it was incredibly emotional.</p><p><b>Your final scene?</b></p><p>Yes. The scene was definitely under the microscope for quite some time\u2014understandably so\u2014but it was poetic and beautiful.</p><p><b>Tell us what you can about filming the last scene.</b></p><p>As I say, I always wanted to show that softer side of Daenerys\u2014or more textured. There\u2019s always a thousand reasons why anyone comes to any conclusion or says anything. We are the product of the experiences that we\u2019ve had, and so with all of these moments when they\u2019re kind of, like, \u201cShe\u2019s just brutal, she\u2019s cold,\u201d I really tried to bring a kind of lightness.</p><p>I wanted to play a game with what the scene was about. It\u2019s not that I wanted to show her as \u201cmad,\u201d because I really don\u2019t like that word. I don\u2019t enjoy fans calling me \u201cthe Mad Queen.\u201d But she is so far gone in grief, in trauma, and in pain. And yet our brains are fascinating in the way that they find a fast route to feel O.K., whether you\u2019re relying on a substance or you\u2019re mildly deluded.</p><p>If you see abuse in someone young, they often are able to mentally leave the room. I wanted Daenerys to be there. I wanted to show her as we saw her in the beginning: young, na\u00efve, childlike, open, and full of love and hope. I wanted so much for that to be the last memory of her.</p><p><b>If they were to reshoot and redo Season 8 entirely, what would you want to happen?</b></p><p>Oh, my goodness. Well, I can only speak to my own character, and the people that I interact with on the show. But I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes with me and Missandei. I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes with me and Cersei.</p><p><b>Oh!</b></p><p>Yeah. I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes between Grey Worm and Missandei. I would\u2019ve loved to see a bit more between Cersei\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I feel like there was\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The genocide was there. That was always going to happen. And I just think more dissection and those beautifully written scenes that the boys have between characters\u2014that we are more than happy to contently sit there and watch ten minutes of two people talking, because it\u2019s beautiful. I just wanted to see a bit more of that. But I\u2019m in no position to critique the geniuses that have written eight seasons\u2019 worth of wonderful stuff.</p><p><b>What are you hoping to see in those final scenes?</b></p><p>I\u2019m hoping to see what I was saying before about Daenerys\u2019s last images being that of kind of a hopeful, childlike love. I just really want that to be the last image of her. And it absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would think anything bad of her. But I\u2019m sure they will, and I can\u2019t control that.</p><p><b><i>- The New Yorker Interview, Daenerys Tells All</i></b></p><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh\",\"display_url\":\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/daenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce\",\"title\":\"Daenerys Tells All!\",\"description\":\"Emilia Clarke on the final episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d meeting Beyonc\u00e9, and the sad fate of Daenerys Targaryen.\",\"site_name\":\"The New Yorker\",\"poster\":[{\"url\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4806986482c8bd1bd9e53e2219a4a7b/tumblr_prttdbV30B1r6drqc_540.jpg\",\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"width\":1121,\"height\":630}]}' class=\"npf_link\"><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh\" target=\"_blank\">Daenerys Tells All!</a></p>",

She\u2019s been a part of me for so long that, in reading this script, I did what any actor is told to do and would do. You have to agree with your character. If you don\u2019t agree with your character, then you shouldn\u2019t take the job.</p><p>I really just had to sit there and wrestle with how I could make good on what they had written. Because that\u2019s her. They are the writers. They have made this woman, and I\u2019m going to take on what it is and try and interpret that to my best ability. Now, when I showed the first glimmer of coldness, in Season 1, when Khal Drogo kills my brother, Viserys Targaryen\u2014Jason [Momoa] kills Harry Lloyd\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.</p><p><b>A glorious moment.</b></p><p>It was the first time I inhabited this kind of steely serenity, this calm, quiet. So that\u2019s where I\u2019ve gone with her. She\u2019s so completely in control of this part of her that it actually calms her.</p><p>I\u2019ve always wanted to warm her up, because I\u2019ve seen the more feminine aspects of her. I\u2019m not saying that as anything derogatory at all. But she was a child. She was sold. She grew up around a life that was written for her. She was on the run her entire life. She lost every single person that meant anything to her. She was brought up by a brother who was telling her why her family had been taken from her, because people haven\u2019t allowed them to inhabit the Iron Throne.</p><p>So that\u2019s always been her mission and, at every turn, she\u2019s sacrificed everything. She sacrificed being a mother. She sacrificed love. She sacrificed happiness. She sacrificed an easy life. She sacrificed friends. She sacrificed everything to be the ruler that she believes herself to be. And, with each next step up that ladder\u2014with each next mass killing, with each bad person that she kills, for every ten good people that she saves, for putting her friends and her lovers in harm\u2019s way\u2014each step up that ladder has just solidified her course towards sitting on top of the Iron Throne. Because then it will all have been worth it.</p><p>Every time I was faced with Daenerys having to do something pretty cold, like a mass killing, it was always with this thought that she\u2019s headed toward her destiny. She\u2019s gone too far to turn back now. So then she finally falls in love with someone who is her age, someone appropriate, who seems to love her back, who seems to be a good guy. The fact that she\u2019s his aunt is just kind of by the by! And then it seems almost too good to be true. Even when she finally gets to relax for the first time, she\u2019s thinking, My God, I can have it all. I can have my love. I can have my career. I can have the prospect of a family. I can have it all.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But no! I fucking can\u2019t.</p><p>She encounters the dark side of that. She\u2019s not wanted. She\u2019s not loved completely there. And so she gives herself to Jon [Snow] entirely, and she gives him many, many choices, many options to see clearly with open eyes. And she\u2019s asking him, \u201cIf you wanted to be with me, then let me fulfill this.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I know I can be a good leader, so let\u2019s do this together. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t. And that disappointment is the final thing that breaks her as a human being, because, my God, all she\u2019s known is pain, sacrifice, and abuse. All she\u2019s known is people turning on her, people betraying her, and she\u2019s completely alone. And so, with all of that, I think that it brings us to the moment where she\u2019s on top of the dragon and making that choice.</p><p><b>When you were sitting on the green-screen dragon in that scene as it began, what were you thinking and feeling to bring that moment about realistically?</b></p><p>On the motor unit, riding a dragon, it takes a week to shoot a minute\u2019s worth\u2014sometimes two weeks. And it\u2019s very hard to engage your acting muscles when you\u2019re, like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to be aware of the dragon breathing.\u201d</p><p>But we wanted very much to show this moment of humanity and choice, a real person deciding to do the thing that they know will only harm themselves, but they can\u2019t help it. I think it\u2019s an incredibly human trait. We all have that thing, whether it\u2019s binging on chocolate or drinking seventeen bottles of wine or having an affair. Whatever it is, everyone\u2019s got this dark part of themselves that no one really likes inhabiting. It\u2019s something we all really struggle with.</p><p><b>A lot of well-known series have ended in a way that\u2019s either mystifying or disappointing.</b></p><p>I always knew that the show was never going to satisfy everyone. I watched and loved too many television series to ever think that would be possible. The stories are too vast, the characters too complex. The show is, in a certain way, divisive: \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Also, if you\u2019re pleasing everyone, then it\u2019s probably quite tepid. But to me it seemed like the only way it\u00a0<i>could</i>\u00a0end.</p><p><b>Didn\u2019t you want it to end more triumphantly for Daenerys?</b></p><p>I\u2019m not sure it could. Even for a part that I\u2019ve given so much to and I\u2019ve felt so much for, and for a character that\u2019s seen and lived through so much, I don\u2019t know that there was any other way. But it was a shocker to read.</p><p><b>Which part was a shocker?</b></p><p>The final moment sort of passed me by when I first read it. And then I suddenly was \u201cWait a second.\u201d And I went back and I reread it, and I was, like, \u201cOh, great. Excellent. What I read was correct.\u201d But then I had to wrestle with that. The actual acting of it was hilariously long and arduous, but it was incredibly emotional.</p><p><b>Your final scene?</b></p><p>Yes. The scene was definitely under the microscope for quite some time\u2014understandably so\u2014but it was poetic and beautiful.</p><p><b>Tell us what you can about filming the last scene.</b></p><p>As I say, I always wanted to show that softer side of Daenerys\u2014or more textured. There\u2019s always a thousand reasons why anyone comes to any conclusion or says anything. We are the product of the experiences that we\u2019ve had, and so with all of these moments when they\u2019re kind of, like, \u201cShe\u2019s just brutal, she\u2019s cold,\u201d I really tried to bring a kind of lightness.</p><p>I wanted to play a game with what the scene was about. It\u2019s not that I wanted to show her as \u201cmad,\u201d because I really don\u2019t like that word. I don\u2019t enjoy fans calling me \u201cthe Mad Queen.\u201d But she is so far gone in grief, in trauma, and in pain. And yet our brains are fascinating in the way that they find a fast route to feel O.K., whether you\u2019re relying on a substance or you\u2019re mildly deluded.</p><p>If you see abuse in someone young, they often are able to mentally leave the room. I wanted Daenerys to be there. I wanted to show her as we saw her in the beginning: young, na\u00efve, childlike, open, and full of love and hope. I wanted so much for that to be the last memory of her.</p><p><b>If they were to reshoot and redo Season 8 entirely, what would you want to happen?</b></p><p>Oh, my goodness. Well, I can only speak to my own character, and the people that I interact with on the show. But I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes with me and Missandei. I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes with me and Cersei.</p><p><b>Oh!</b></p><p>Yeah. I would\u2019ve loved some more scenes between Grey Worm and Missandei. I would\u2019ve loved to see a bit more between Cersei\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I feel like there was\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The genocide was there. That was always going to happen. And I just think more dissection and those beautifully written scenes that the boys have between characters\u2014that we are more than happy to contently sit there and watch ten minutes of two people talking, because it\u2019s beautiful. I just wanted to see a bit more of that. But I\u2019m in no position to critique the geniuses that have written eight seasons\u2019 worth of wonderful stuff.</p><p><b>What are you hoping to see in those final scenes?</b></p><p>I\u2019m hoping to see what I was saying before about Daenerys\u2019s last images being that of kind of a hopeful, childlike love. I just really want that to be the last image of her. And it absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would think anything bad of her. But I\u2019m sure they will, and I can\u2019t control that.</p><p><b><i>- The New Yorker Interview, Daenerys Tells All</i></b></p><p data-npf='{\"type\":\"link\",\"url\":\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh\",\"display_url\":\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/daenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce\",\"title\":\"Daenerys Tells All!\",\"description\":\"Emilia Clarke on the final episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d meeting Beyonc\u00e9, and the sad fate of Daenerys Targaryen.\",\"site_name\":\"The New Yorker\",\"poster\":[{\"url\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4806986482c8bd1bd9e53e2219a4a7b/tumblr_prttdbV30B1r6drqc_540.jpg\",\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"width\":1121,\"height\":630}]}' class=\"npf_link\"><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh\" target=\"_blank\">Daenerys Tells All!</a></p></p>",

Are you disappointed? Were you surprised? Have you taken note of the\u00a0feminist criticism\u00a0of this?</b></p><p>I read these scripts coming on to two years ago now. When I did, I took a very long walk around London in a daze, not quite knowing how to digest the news. Now, finally, people are going, \u201cOh, now we understand why this season hit you hard.\u201d I had no idea what to expect for this last season. I hoped for some juicy things to get into, as I always do for each season, but I didn\u2019t see this coming. Throughout the show, there have been these glorious moments of Daenerys taking on a very strong role in a battle or in a decision to be made. There were these wonderful moments when she takes control, and it\u2019s really liberating and beautiful. She frees people, she kills the baddies, and it feels good.</p><p>And, I must admit, I was sitting tentatively on that chair thinking, How long is this going to last? Everyone was saying, \u201cIsn\u2019t she great? She\u2019s our savior,\u00a0Mhysa.\u201d It\u2019s been beautiful and amazing, but I\u2019ve been looking over my shoulder the entire time while everyone else gets a more human\u2014for want of a better word\u2014story line. They do good things. They do bad things. They do silly things. They do brilliant things. They fall in love. They break hearts. Daenerys has quite consistently had this road to salvation, and she\u2019s been sitting atop a very safe mountain.</p><p>I remember the boys\u2014our writers and showrunners\u2014telling me that Daenerys\u2019s arc is that of Lawrence of Arabia. I watched \u201cLawrence of Arabia,\u201d and I was, like, \u201cGreat, cool. He\u2019s brilliant. He survived, and it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d But then you remember how that movie ended, with Lawrence\u2019s disintegration. I didn\u2019t quite put those two things together. Or maybe I didn\u2019t want to see it coming because I care about Daenerys too much.</p><p><b>Can you talk about that a little more, how Daenerys\u2019s arc is like Lawrence of Arabia\u2019s life?</b></p><p>Well, fundamentally, he\u2019s brought in as a savior. He goes in and fights for the people, but then, ultimately, it\u2019s a story about how power corrupts absolutely. You see power turn this man wild and mad. He can\u2019t see anymore through the haze, the giddy highs, of being in charge. And that\u2019s what Daenerys experiences. And yet I care for her so much. She\u2019s been a part of me for so long that, in reading this script, I did what any actor is told to do and would do. You have to agree with your character. If you don\u2019t agree with your character, then you shouldn\u2019t take the job.</p><p>I really just had to sit there and wrestle with how I could make good on what they had written.

Are you disappointed? Were you surprised? Have you taken note of the&nbsp;feminist criticism&nbsp;of this?</b></p><p>I read these scripts coming on to two years ago now. When I did, I took a very long walk around London in a daze, not quite knowing how to digest the news. Now, finally, people are going, &ldquo;Oh, now we understand why this season hit you hard.&rdquo; I had no idea what to expect for this last season. I hoped for some juicy things to get into, as I always do for each season, but I didn&rsquo;t see this coming. Throughout the show, there have been these glorious moments of Daenerys taking on a very strong role in a battle or in a decision to be made. There were these wonderful moments when she takes control, and it&rsquo;s really liberating and beautiful. She frees people, she kills the baddies, and it feels good.</p><p>And, I must admit, I was sitting tentatively on that chair thinking, How long is this going to last? Everyone was saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she great? She&rsquo;s our savior,&nbsp;Mhysa.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s been beautiful and amazing, but I&rsquo;ve been looking over my shoulder the entire time while everyone else gets a more human&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;story line. They do good things. They do bad things. They do silly things. They do brilliant things. They fall in love. They break hearts. Daenerys has quite consistently had this road to salvation, and she&rsquo;s been sitting atop a very safe mountain.</p><p>I remember the boys&mdash;our writers and showrunners&mdash;telling me that Daenerys&rsquo;s arc is that of Lawrence of Arabia. I watched &ldquo;Lawrence of Arabia,&rdquo; and I was, like, &ldquo;Great, cool. He&rsquo;s brilliant. He survived, and it&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo; But then you remember how that movie ended, with Lawrence&rsquo;s disintegration. I didn&rsquo;t quite put those two things together. Or maybe I didn&rsquo;t want to see it coming because I care about Daenerys too much.</p><p><b>Can you talk about that a little more, how Daenerys&rsquo;s arc is like Lawrence of Arabia&rsquo;s life?</b></p><p>Well, fundamentally, he&rsquo;s brought in as a savior. He goes in and fights for the people, but then, ultimately, it&rsquo;s a story about how power corrupts absolutely. You see power turn this man wild and mad. He can&rsquo;t see anymore through the haze, the giddy highs, of being in charge. And that&rsquo;s what Daenerys experiences. And yet I care for her so much. She&rsquo;s been a part of me for so long that, in reading this script, I did what any actor is told to do and would do. You have to agree with your character. If you don&rsquo;t agree with your character, then you shouldn&rsquo;t take the job.</p><p>I really just had to sit there and wrestle with how I could make good on what they had written. Because that&rsquo;s her. They are the writers. They have made this woman, and I&rsquo;m going to take on what it is and try and interpret that to my best ability. Now, when I showed the first glimmer of coldness, in Season 1, when Khal Drogo kills my brother, Viserys Targaryen&mdash;Jason [Momoa] kills Harry Lloyd&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p><b>A glorious moment.</b></p><p>It was the first time I inhabited this kind of steely serenity, this calm, quiet. So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve gone with her. She&rsquo;s so completely in control of this part of her that it actually calms her.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to warm her up, because I&rsquo;ve seen the more feminine aspects of her. I&rsquo;m not saying that as anything derogatory at all. But she was a child. She was sold. She grew up around a life that was written for her. She was on the run her entire life. She lost every single person that meant anything to her. She was brought up by a brother who was telling her why her family had been taken from her, because people haven&rsquo;t allowed them to inhabit the Iron Throne.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s always been her mission and, at every turn, she&rsquo;s sacrificed everything. She sacrificed being a mother. She sacrificed love. She sacrificed happiness. She sacrificed an easy life. She sacrificed friends. She sacrificed everything to be the ruler that she believes herself to be. And, with each next step up that ladder&mdash;with each next mass killing, with each bad person that she kills, for every ten good people that she saves, for putting her friends and her lovers in harm&rsquo;s way&mdash;each step up that ladder has just solidified her course towards sitting on top of the Iron Throne. Because then it will all have been worth it.</p><p>Every time I was faced with Daenerys having to do something pretty cold, like a mass killing, it was always with this thought that she&rsquo;s headed toward her destiny. She&rsquo;s gone too far to turn back now. So then she finally falls in love with someone who is her age, someone appropriate, who seems to love her back, who seems to be a good guy. The fact that she&rsquo;s his aunt is just kind of by the by! And then it seems almost too good to be true. Even when she finally gets to relax for the first time, she&rsquo;s thinking, My God, I can have it all. I can have my love. I can have my career. I can have the prospect of a family. I can have it all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But no! I fucking can&rsquo;t.</p><p>She encounters the dark side of that. She&rsquo;s not wanted. She&rsquo;s not loved completely there. And so she gives herself to Jon [Snow] entirely, and she gives him many, many choices, many options to see clearly with open eyes. And she&rsquo;s asking him, &ldquo;If you wanted to be with me, then let me fulfill this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know I can be a good leader, so let&rsquo;s do this together. Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo; And he doesn&rsquo;t. And that disappointment is the final thing that breaks her as a human being, because, my God, all she&rsquo;s known is pain, sacrifice, and abuse. All she&rsquo;s known is people turning on her, people betraying her, and she&rsquo;s completely alone. And so, with all of that, I think that it brings us to the moment where she&rsquo;s on top of the dragon and making that choice.</p><p><b>When you were sitting on the green-screen dragon in that scene as it began, what were you thinking and feeling to bring that moment about realistically?</b></p><p>On the motor unit, riding a dragon, it takes a week to shoot a minute&rsquo;s worth&mdash;sometimes two weeks. And it&rsquo;s very hard to engage your acting muscles when you&rsquo;re, like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be aware of the dragon breathing.&rdquo;</p><p>But we wanted very much to show this moment of humanity and choice, a real person deciding to do the thing that they know will only harm themselves, but they can&rsquo;t help it. I think it&rsquo;s an incredibly human trait. We all have that thing, whether it&rsquo;s binging on chocolate or drinking seventeen bottles of wine or having an affair. Whatever it is, everyone&rsquo;s got this dark part of themselves that no one really likes inhabiting. It&rsquo;s something we all really struggle with.</p><p><b>A lot of well-known series have ended in a way that&rsquo;s either mystifying or disappointing.</b></p><p>I always knew that the show was never going to satisfy everyone. I watched and loved too many television series to ever think that would be possible. The stories are too vast, the characters too complex. The show is, in a certain way, divisive: &ldquo;Whose side are you on?&rdquo; Also, if you&rsquo;re pleasing everyone, then it&rsquo;s probably quite tepid. But to me it seemed like the only way it&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;end.</p><p><b>Didn&rsquo;t you want it to end more triumphantly for Daenerys?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure it could. Even for a part that I&rsquo;ve given so much to and I&rsquo;ve felt so much for, and for a character that&rsquo;s seen and lived through so much, I don&rsquo;t know that there was any other way. But it was a shocker to read.</p><p><b>Which part was a shocker?</b></p><p>The final moment sort of passed me by when I first read it. And then I suddenly was &ldquo;Wait a second.&rdquo; And I went back and I reread it, and I was, like, &ldquo;Oh, great. Excellent. What I read was correct.&rdquo; But then I had to wrestle with that. The actual acting of it was hilariously long and arduous, but it was incredibly emotional.</p><p><b>Your final scene?</b></p><p>Yes. The scene was definitely under the microscope for quite some time&mdash;understandably so&mdash;but it was poetic and beautiful.</p><p><b>Tell us what you can about filming the last scene.</b></p><p>As I say, I always wanted to show that softer side of Daenerys&mdash;or more textured. There&rsquo;s always a thousand reasons why anyone comes to any conclusion or says anything. We are the product of the experiences that we&rsquo;ve had, and so with all of these moments when they&rsquo;re kind of, like, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just brutal, she&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; I really tried to bring a kind of lightness.</p><p>I wanted to play a game with what the scene was about. It&rsquo;s not that I wanted to show her as &ldquo;mad,&rdquo; because I really don&rsquo;t like that word. I don&rsquo;t enjoy fans calling me &ldquo;the Mad Queen.&rdquo; But she is so far gone in grief, in trauma, and in pain. And yet our brains are fascinating in the way that they find a fast route to feel O.K., whether you&rsquo;re relying on a substance or you&rsquo;re mildly deluded.</p><p>If you see abuse in someone young, they often are able to mentally leave the room. I wanted Daenerys to be there. I wanted to show her as we saw her in the beginning: young, na&iuml;ve, childlike, open, and full of love and hope. I wanted so much for that to be the last memory of her.</p><p><b>If they were to reshoot and redo Season 8 entirely, what would you want to happen?</b></p><p>Oh, my goodness. Well, I can only speak to my own character, and the people that I interact with on the show. But I would&rsquo;ve loved some more scenes with me and Missandei. I would&rsquo;ve loved some more scenes with me and Cersei.</p><p><b>Oh!</b></p><p>Yeah. I would&rsquo;ve loved some more scenes between Grey Worm and Missandei. I would&rsquo;ve loved to see a bit more between Cersei&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel like there was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The genocide was there. That was always going to happen. And I just think more dissection and those beautifully written scenes that the boys have between characters&mdash;that we are more than happy to contently sit there and watch ten minutes of two people talking, because it&rsquo;s beautiful. I just wanted to see a bit more of that. But I&rsquo;m in no position to critique the geniuses that have written eight seasons&rsquo; worth of wonderful stuff.</p><p><b>What are you hoping to see in those final scenes?</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m hoping to see what I was saying before about Daenerys&rsquo;s last images being that of kind of a hopeful, childlike love. I just really want that to be the last image of her. And it absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would think anything bad of her. But I&rsquo;m sure they will, and I can&rsquo;t control that.</p><p><b><i>- The New Yorker Interview, Daenerys Tells All</i></b></p><p data-npf=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;link&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh&quot;,&quot;display_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/daenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Daenerys Tells All!&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Emilia Clarke on the final episode of &ldquo;Game of Thrones,&rdquo; meeting Beyonc&eacute;, and the sad fate of Daenerys Targaryen.&quot;,&quot;site_name&quot;:&quot;The New Yorker&quot;,&quot;poster&quot;:[{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/b4806986482c8bd1bd9e53e2219a4a7b/tumblr_prttdbV30B1r6drqc_540.jpg&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1121,&quot;height&quot;:630}]}\" class=\"npf_link\"><a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fthe-new-yorker-interview%2Fdaenerys-tells-all-game-of-thrones-finale-emilia-clarke-beyonce&amp;t=YzVmNDk1ODZiMGQ1MjY0ZWIzYjAyM2FmZDg1N2EyMDNkZTZjYTM4OCw1MTg0ZDdiNzEwMzY1Mzc4ZmY3ZTc0N2ZlNTY2NzcyNDhmNjIwNTJh\" target=\"_blank\">Daenerys Tells All!</a></p></p>",
