So here\u2019s part 2 of So Sorry. Hope you guys like it. And pretend SOTT belongs to his second album and it won Grammy\n\nP.S: part 3 coming soon! </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cMy love, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N was confused, angry, sad, thankful and guilty. She didn\u2019t know what to\nmake out of those five words; she didn\u2019t know what he meant by those five\nwords; she didnt know if he really meant them and she didn\u2019t know how to reply\nto them. But, she had to; she wanted to. If Y/N wanted she could\u2019ve easily hung\nup on him but she couldn\u2019t- his voice, it was just too beautiful and the sobs\ncoming out of his lips sounded too painful.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? Why are you calling me?\u201d Y/N said as she got\nout of the bed pushing Jake aside before making her way down the stairs to the\nliving room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so fucking sorry for what I said that day and what I\ndid to us, Y/N I swear I didn\u2019t mean it. You didn\u2019t make my life miserable, how\ncould you? I was just frustrated, and I let that out on you. I know that\ndoesn\u2019t give me an excuse but I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>Y/N cut him off. \u201cHarry listen, this is not really the best time.\u201d</p><p>Harry spoke before she could say anything else. \u201cWe can meet. Tomorrow?\nI can come to your place or -or you can come to mine or the Zonko\u2019s? We didn\u2019t\ngo there in ages!\u201d Y/N could tell Harry was hopeful, but for some reason\nit made her angry.</p><p>How could he appear in her life when she felt like she was moving on! How\ncould he appear in her life when she finally found a little happiness in\nsomeone else! It was over one year and he decided to call her only then? And it\ntook him this long just to realize what he did? Y/N wasn\u2019t having that. After\nshe had left him, she had completely blocked him out of her life but there was\na part which just wanted to go back to him, and she knew she would if Harry\neven tried to win her back. But, when she turned her phone back on after a week\nof hybernation in her bedroom, she was surprised he hadn\u2019t called her, not even\nonce.</p><p>Her heart was already broken when she heard him mumble those hurtful words\nunder his breath but when she realized he didn\u2019t even try to contact her at\nall, her heart shattered into millions of pieces.</p><p>At first she couldn\u2019t really accept it, she gave herself excuses - maybe his\ncalling her but the network is bad; maybe he tried a lot at first but just\nthought of giving her some space, but will eventually come back; maybe he just\nneeds time to clear his head. Y/N actually believed those but when she saw a\npicture of him making out with a French super model just after few weeks, she\ndidn\u2019t know what to believe. She didn\u2019t know if she should believe <i>her</i> Harry or\nthe Harry she was seeing on magazines. However, she knew about the media and\nhow they can make someone look and she knew about the all the stunts Jeff made\nhim do, so she believed in the Harry she knew. Her Harry wouldn\u2019t just throw\nall of the things they had just like that. But, after two months when she\ndidn\u2019t get any call from him, she realized he wasn\u2019t hers anymore.</p><p>Y/N had thrown her life away after that. She felt betrayed, she felt stupid\nand she felt numb. However, 9 months later she met Jake. Y/N knew she wasn\u2019t in\nlove with him and she knew he wasn\u2019t over him completely but Jake made her\nhappy, he made her almost forget him.</p><p>\u201cHarry! We can\u2019t meet!\u201d Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Please,\u201d the hope that was in his voice disappeared in\na second.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re calling me after a year, but I\u2019ve moved\non,\u201d she lied. Y/N felt even admitting her feelings for Harry meant\nbetraying Jake, and she can never do that.</p><p>Harry was silent for a while before he spoke. \u201cWe can still meet, we\ncan clear things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please please I just wanna talk about few things, promise it won\u2019t\ntake long.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was desperate, so desperate that Y/N almost felt\nhis life depended on her answer.</p><p>Y/N looked back at the staircase, then to the clock across the room.</p><p><i><b>12:56</b></i></p><p>Y/N let out a huff, \u201cfine, 4 in Zonko\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay-\u201d</p><p>Y/N hung up on that. She was furious. Who did he think he was! Calling her\nat the middle of the night apologizing for things he did over a year ago!</p><p>Y/N went back to her bedroom. Jake was still peacefully sleeping in the bed.\nY/N let you out a sigh. She wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, they were just gonna\ntalk and start on their own life again- she told herself.</p><p>Y/N got under the comforters. However she couldn\u2019t sleep. She was thinking\nabout the things Harry was going to talk at Zonko\u2019s, she was thinking what made\nhim call after so long and she was thinking why he started to care about her\nall of a sudden.</p><p>Y/N sighed again before turning her back to Jake and finally after tossing\nand turning for a while, she fell asleep.</p><p>*</p><p>Y/N slowly walked through the busy street as she saw the very familiar sign\nof \u2018Zonko\u2019s Coffee\u2019 on the other side of the road. She crossed the road on\nsignal and entered the cafe. The familier scent of coffee beans filled Y/N\u2019s\nnostril making her remember all the times she had gone there with Harry. Y/N\nremembered their very first meeting and she remembered the time when she went\nhome after waiting for him for two hours on their fifth anniversary.</p><p>Suddenly her stomach turned and the only thing she wanted to do was curl in\nher bed with her cat, Ginger and watch Netflix. Y/N looked at their usual seat\nthen around the cafe, he hadn\u2019t come yet, if she wanted she could easily go\nback home and send him a massage saying she couldn\u2019t make it. However, she\ndecided otherwise, she wasn\u2019t going to chicken out just like that.</p><p>She walked up to the counter and stood in the line. There were only two\npeople in front of her. Y/N looked back at the door again for any sign of\nHarry, but he wasn\u2019t there yet. Y/N was nervous and out of habit she started to\nunconsciously play with her fingers until her turn came.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Sasha, the accountant said amused. She was clearly not\nexpecting to see her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sasha,\u201d Y/N replied with a polite smile.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see you here in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just ya know don\u2019t really get the time,\u201d Y/N lied.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBusy life huh, should come once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d Sasha still had her smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Y/N said with a smile matching hers.</p><p>\u201cIs Harry coming or it\u2019s just you?\u201d Sasha asked as she typed away\non her computer.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah he is coming,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWant to order for him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N debated in her mind before saying he\u2019d have the usual too. Sasha smiled to\nthat and made her bill. After paying for the bills Y/N went to seat at their\nusual seat -at the corner of the room next to window.</p><p>Y/N sighed as she sat down, resting her head in her hand looking out of the\nwindow. She hated to be there, it just bought so many memories back. Y/N still\nremembered the first time they kissed, seating on that very seat; she was so\nhappy then; he made her so happy.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t think like that - not after what he made\nher go through Y/N looked away from the window and took her phone out, pushing\nall of the thoughts away.</p><p>Many people came in and went out of the small and very cozy cafe, making the\nbell hanging above the door jiggle, but Y/N didn\u2019t care about any of those.\nHowever, at 4:06 she was swirling the straw of her hot chocolate when the bell\njiggled again. For some reason, Y/N prominently heard it, she felt as if the\nbusy chattering in the coffee completely stopped and the only thing making any\nsound at all was the bell. Y/N quickly looked up from her phone\u2026.It was him,\nlooking straight at her with her green orbs.</p><p>Y/N let out a breath. Seeing him after so long, felt different to her, the\nfeeling was unfamiliar to her. It wasn\u2019t like the times he came back from tour,\nit was different -but whatever the feeling was it felt good, it felt so good.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes, she noticed were lighter shade of green that day. Y/N stared\nat them for a while but she didn\u2019t know for how long. Y/N felt like time had\nstopped, no one moved and it was just them, looking at each other. Y/N\u2019s eyes\ntravelled down to his parted lips and then Y/N had this huge urge to press her\nlips onto his.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s voice rang in her ears bringing her back to reality. Everything was\nnormal again, everyone was moving around her; the clock was ticking and she\nremembered she had a boy friend and she remembered what he said.</p><p>Y/N quickly looked down at her phone sending a &lsquo;ttyl\u2019 to her sister. By the\ntime Y/N shoved her phone back into her bag Harry had already taken a seat\nacross her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Y/N looked up at him, as she tugged a strand of hair behind\nher ears. God, she was nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said as Y/N could tell he was studying her face.</p><p>\u201cGood, you tell?\u201d she pushed the cup of black coffee Sasha served\nher just few minutes ago towards him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, I - I could\u2019ve been better,\u201d he stuttered scratching\nthe back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you call me last night, after a year?\u201d Y/N said after\na while.</p><p>\u201cUh, I,\u201d Harry let out an audible sigh. \u201c Y/N, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m\nso fucking sorry. I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. I loved you, who am I\nkidding? I love you, I love you so fucking much. I was an ass, but I promise I\ndidn\u2019t mean what I said, how could I? You\u2019re my everything and you made me so\nhappy,\u201d Harry rambled, his voice became heavier and heavier as his eyes\nbecame watery.</p><p>\u201cWhy now? After a year?\u201d Y/N said again, he voice cold but her\neyes were watery too.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d Harry looked down at his coffee. \u201cI won Grammys\nlast, and-and looking at it just made me realize it was nothing without you,\nI\u2019m nothing without you, my love.\u201d</p><p>But, Y/N wasn\u2019t listening. Her mind was stuck at 'I won Grammys\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou won Grammys?\u201d She blurted out her face almost breaking into a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, still looking down at his coffee. He was about\nto speak again but Y/N cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked her voice laced with excitement. Harry\nfinally looked up and he was quite shocked to see Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkle and a grin\non her face, but he couldn\u2019t be more thankful - it was a blessing to see her\nlike that.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked again, but louder that time. Then it\nhit him, she was happy for him, she was happy that Harry won the Grammy, she\nhappy for him even after what he did to her. If Harry didn\u2019t already feel like\nshit, he surely did then.</p><p>\u201cUh, best rock song,\u201d he said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWhich song?\u201d Y/N\u2019s voice still excited.</p><p>\u201cSign of the times.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s face suddenly fell. She hadn\u2019t heard it and she remembered why she\nhadn\u2019t bothered to hear it.</p><p>Y/N took a sip of her coffee. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you! It was the only thing\nyou ever wanted,\u201d she gave him a huge smile before looking down at her\ncoffee as she played with the straw.</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while before he started softly. \u201cIt means\nnothing without you, please give me a chance I\u2019ll prove myself to you. I\npromise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N trailed off. \u201cYou know you hurt me so much. I\nwaited for you, you know. Just one call, I wasn\u2019t even hoping for an apologyi\njust wanted you to call me and just check on me and just show that you cared.\nBut you never did. You made me believe you truly regretted asking me out and\nthat I made your life miserable\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, no,\u201d Harry took her hand in his.\u201cIt was the best decision\nI ever made when I asked you out. And you could never make my life miserable,\nthey were the best time of my life. I don\u2019t know what had gotten into me, but\nplease, please give me one chance, I\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m with someone,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were no longer bright but\nthey were filled with tears and her nose was red. Y/N looked down at their\nintertwined hands. Y/N slowly caressed his knuckles with her thumb.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to be with Harry, but she was scared.\nShe was so fucking scared. He hurt her so bad, she just didn\u2019t have the courage\nto risk to go through all that again.</p><p>Y/N felt a tear roll down her cheek, but she didn\u2019t bother to wipe it. She\nwas torn, between her heart and her brain. Her heart told her to leave Jake and\ngive Harry a chance where her brain told her she was being nothing but stupid\nand that he was going to hurt her again. Y/N just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cY/N please give me one chance,\u201d Harry said softly as he wiped the\ntear from her cheek before cupping it. \u201cPlease, I love you.\u201d</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>\u201cYou are too late, Harry,\u201d Y/N pushed his hand away from her face\nand let go of his hand. She hastily got up and hung her bag over her shoulder.\n\u201cYou took too much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on your Grammy, I\u2019m really happy for you, and I mean\nit,\u201d she said one last time before marching out of the cafe leaving Harry\nalone, filled with guilt and regret for the second time.</p>",

She was thinking\nabout the things Harry was going to talk at Zonko\u2019s, she was thinking what made\nhim call after so long and she was thinking why he started to care about her\nall of a sudden.</p><p>Y/N sighed again before turning her back to Jake and finally after tossing\nand turning for a while, she fell asleep.</p><p>*</p><p>Y/N slowly walked through the busy street as she saw the very familiar sign\nof \u2018Zonko\u2019s Coffee\u2019 on the other side of the road. She crossed the road on\nsignal and entered the cafe. The familier scent of coffee beans filled Y/N\u2019s\nnostril making her remember all the times she had gone there with Harry. Y/N\nremembered their very first meeting and she remembered the time when she went\nhome after waiting for him for two hours on their fifth anniversary.</p><p>Suddenly her stomach turned and the only thing she wanted to do was curl in\nher bed with her cat, Ginger and watch Netflix. Y/N looked at their usual seat\nthen around the cafe, he hadn\u2019t come yet, if she wanted she could easily go\nback home and send him a massage saying she couldn\u2019t make it. However, she\ndecided otherwise, she wasn\u2019t going to chicken out just like that.</p><p>She walked up to the counter and stood in the line. There were only two\npeople in front of her. Y/N looked back at the door again for any sign of\nHarry, but he wasn\u2019t there yet. Y/N was nervous and out of habit she started to\nunconsciously play with her fingers until her turn came.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Sasha, the accountant said amused. She was clearly not\nexpecting to see her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sasha,\u201d Y/N replied with a polite smile.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see you here in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just ya know don\u2019t really get the time,\u201d Y/N lied.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBusy life huh, should come once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d Sasha still had her smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Y/N said with a smile matching hers.</p><p>\u201cIs Harry coming or it\u2019s just you?\u201d Sasha asked as she typed away\non her computer.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah he is coming,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWant to order for him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N debated in her mind before saying he\u2019d have the usual too. Sasha smiled to\nthat and made her bill. After paying for the bills Y/N went to seat at their\nusual seat -at the corner of the room next to window.</p><p>Y/N sighed as she sat down, resting her head in her hand looking out of the\nwindow. She hated to be there, it just bought so many memories back. Y/N still\nremembered the first time they kissed, seating on that very seat; she was so\nhappy then; he made her so happy.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t think like that - not after what he made\nher go through Y/N looked away from the window and took her phone out, pushing\nall of the thoughts away.</p><p>Many people came in and went out of the small and very cozy cafe, making the\nbell hanging above the door jiggle, but Y/N didn\u2019t care about any of those.\nHowever, at 4:06 she was swirling the straw of her hot chocolate when the bell\njiggled again. For some reason, Y/N prominently heard it, she felt as if the\nbusy chattering in the coffee completely stopped and the only thing making any\nsound at all was the bell. Y/N quickly looked up from her phone\u2026.It was him,\nlooking straight at her with her green orbs.</p><p>Y/N let out a breath. Seeing him after so long, felt different to her, the\nfeeling was unfamiliar to her. It wasn\u2019t like the times he came back from tour,\nit was different -but whatever the feeling was it felt good, it felt so good.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes, she noticed were lighter shade of green that day. Y/N stared\nat them for a while but she didn\u2019t know for how long. Y/N felt like time had\nstopped, no one moved and it was just them, looking at each other. Y/N\u2019s eyes\ntravelled down to his parted lips and then Y/N had this huge urge to press her\nlips onto his.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s voice rang in her ears bringing her back to reality. Everything was\nnormal again, everyone was moving around her; the clock was ticking and she\nremembered she had a boy friend and she remembered what he said.</p><p>Y/N quickly looked down at her phone sending a \u2018ttyl\u2019 to her sister. By the\ntime Y/N shoved her phone back into her bag Harry had already taken a seat\nacross her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Y/N looked up at him, as she tugged a strand of hair behind\nher ears. God, she was nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said as Y/N could tell he was studying her face.</p><p>\u201cGood, you tell?\u201d she pushed the cup of black coffee Sasha served\nher just few minutes ago towards him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, I - I could\u2019ve been better,\u201d he stuttered scratching\nthe back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you call me last night, after a year?\u201d Y/N said after\na while.</p><p>\u201cUh, I,\u201d Harry let out an audible sigh. \u201c Y/N, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m\nso fucking sorry. I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. I loved you, who am I\nkidding? I love you, I love you so fucking much. I was an ass, but I promise I\ndidn\u2019t mean what I said, how could I? You\u2019re my everything and you made me so\nhappy,\u201d Harry rambled, his voice became heavier and heavier as his eyes\nbecame watery.</p><p>\u201cWhy now? After a year?\u201d Y/N said again, he voice cold but her\neyes were watery too.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d Harry looked down at his coffee. \u201cI won Grammys\nlast, and-and looking at it just made me realize it was nothing without you,\nI\u2019m nothing without you, my love.\u201d</p><p>But, Y/N wasn\u2019t listening. Her mind was stuck at 'I won Grammys\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou won Grammys?\u201d She blurted out her face almost breaking into a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, still looking down at his coffee. He was about\nto speak again but Y/N cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked her voice laced with excitement. Harry\nfinally looked up and he was quite shocked to see Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkle and a grin\non her face, but he couldn\u2019t be more thankful - it was a blessing to see her\nlike that.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked again, but louder that time. Then it\nhit him, she was happy for him, she was happy that Harry won the Grammy, she\nhappy for him even after what he did to her. If Harry didn\u2019t already feel like\nshit, he surely did then.</p><p>\u201cUh, best rock song,\u201d he said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWhich song?\u201d Y/N\u2019s voice still excited.</p><p>\u201cSign of the times.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s face suddenly fell. She hadn\u2019t heard it and she remembered why she\nhadn\u2019t bothered to hear it.</p><p>Y/N took a sip of her coffee. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you! It was the only thing\nyou ever wanted,\u201d she gave him a huge smile before looking down at her\ncoffee as she played with the straw.</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while before he started softly. \u201cIt means\nnothing without you, please give me a chance I\u2019ll prove myself to you. I\npromise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N trailed off. \u201cYou know you hurt me so much. I\nwaited for you, you know. Just one call, I wasn\u2019t even hoping for an apologyi\njust wanted you to call me and just check on me and just show that you cared.\nBut you never did. You made me believe you truly regretted asking me out and\nthat I made your life miserable\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, no,\u201d Harry took her hand in his.\u201cIt was the best decision\nI ever made when I asked you out. And you could never make my life miserable,\nthey were the best time of my life. I don\u2019t know what had gotten into me, but\nplease, please give me one chance, I\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m with someone,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were no longer bright but\nthey were filled with tears and her nose was red. Y/N looked down at their\nintertwined hands. Y/N slowly caressed his knuckles with her thumb.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to be with Harry, but she was scared.\nShe was so fucking scared. He hurt her so bad, she just didn\u2019t have the courage\nto risk to go through all that again.</p><p>Y/N felt a tear roll down her cheek, but she didn\u2019t bother to wipe it. She\nwas torn, between her heart and her brain. Her heart told her to leave Jake and\ngive Harry a chance where her brain told her she was being nothing but stupid\nand that he was going to hurt her again. Y/N just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cY/N please give me one chance,\u201d Harry said softly as he wiped the\ntear from her cheek before cupping it. \u201cPlease, I love you.\u201d</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>\u201cYou are too late, Harry,\u201d Y/N pushed his hand away from her face\nand let go of his hand. She hastily got up and hung her bag over her shoulder.\n\u201cYou took too much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on your Grammy, I\u2019m really happy for you, and I mean\nit,\u201d she said one last time before marching out of the cafe leaving Harry\nalone, filled with guilt and regret for the second time.</p>",

So here\u2019s part 2 of So Sorry. Hope you guys like it. And pretend SOTT belongs to his second album and it won Grammy\n\nP.S: part 3 coming soon! </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cMy love, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</i></p><p>Y/N was confused, angry, sad, thankful and guilty. She didn\u2019t know what to\nmake out of those five words; she didn\u2019t know what he meant by those five\nwords; she didnt know if he really meant them and she didn\u2019t know how to reply\nto them. But, she had to; she wanted to. If Y/N wanted she could\u2019ve easily hung\nup on him but she couldn\u2019t- his voice, it was just too beautiful and the sobs\ncoming out of his lips sounded too painful.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? Why are you calling me?\u201d Y/N said as she got\nout of the bed pushing Jake aside before making her way down the stairs to the\nliving room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so fucking sorry for what I said that day and what I\ndid to us, Y/N I swear I didn\u2019t mean it. You didn\u2019t make my life miserable, how\ncould you? I was just frustrated, and I let that out on you. I know that\ndoesn\u2019t give me an excuse but I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>Y/N cut him off. \u201cHarry listen, this is not really the best time.\u201d</p><p>Harry spoke before she could say anything else. \u201cWe can meet. Tomorrow?\nI can come to your place or -or you can come to mine or the Zonko\u2019s? We didn\u2019t\ngo there in ages!\u201d Y/N could tell Harry was hopeful, but for some reason\nit made her angry.</p><p>How could he appear in her life when she felt like she was moving on! How\ncould he appear in her life when she finally found a little happiness in\nsomeone else! It was over one year and he decided to call her only then? And it\ntook him this long just to realize what he did? Y/N wasn\u2019t having that. After\nshe had left him, she had completely blocked him out of her life but there was\na part which just wanted to go back to him, and she knew she would if Harry\neven tried to win her back. But, when she turned her phone back on after a week\nof hybernation in her bedroom, she was surprised he hadn\u2019t called her, not even\nonce.</p><p>Her heart was already broken when she heard him mumble those hurtful words\nunder his breath but when she realized he didn\u2019t even try to contact her at\nall, her heart shattered into millions of pieces.</p><p>At first she couldn\u2019t really accept it, she gave herself excuses - maybe his\ncalling her but the network is bad; maybe he tried a lot at first but just\nthought of giving her some space, but will eventually come back; maybe he just\nneeds time to clear his head. Y/N actually believed those but when she saw a\npicture of him making out with a French super model just after few weeks, she\ndidn\u2019t know what to believe. She didn\u2019t know if she should believe <i>her</i> Harry or\nthe Harry she was seeing on magazines. However, she knew about the media and\nhow they can make someone look and she knew about the all the stunts Jeff made\nhim do, so she believed in the Harry she knew. Her Harry wouldn\u2019t just throw\nall of the things they had just like that. But, after two months when she\ndidn\u2019t get any call from him, she realized he wasn\u2019t hers anymore.</p><p>Y/N had thrown her life away after that. She felt betrayed, she felt stupid\nand she felt numb. However, 9 months later she met Jake. Y/N knew she wasn\u2019t in\nlove with him and she knew he wasn\u2019t over him completely but Jake made her\nhappy, he made her almost forget him.</p><p>\u201cHarry! We can\u2019t meet!\u201d Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Please,\u201d the hope that was in his voice disappeared in\na second.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re calling me after a year, but I\u2019ve moved\non,\u201d she lied. Y/N felt even admitting her feelings for Harry meant\nbetraying Jake, and she can never do that.</p><p>Harry was silent for a while before he spoke. \u201cWe can still meet, we\ncan clear things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please please I just wanna talk about few things, promise it won\u2019t\ntake long.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice was desperate, so desperate that Y/N almost felt\nhis life depended on her answer.</p><p>Y/N looked back at the staircase, then to the clock across the room.</p><p><i><b>12:56</b></i></p><p>Y/N let out a huff, \u201cfine, 4 in Zonko\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay-\u201d</p><p>Y/N hung up on that. She was furious. Who did he think he was! Calling her\nat the middle of the night apologizing for things he did over a year ago!</p><p>Y/N went back to her bedroom. Jake was still peacefully sleeping in the bed.\nY/N let you out a sigh. She wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, they were just gonna\ntalk and start on their own life again- she told herself.</p><p>Y/N got under the comforters. However she couldn\u2019t sleep. She was thinking\nabout the things Harry was going to talk at Zonko\u2019s, she was thinking what made\nhim call after so long and she was thinking why he started to care about her\nall of a sudden.</p><p>Y/N sighed again before turning her back to Jake and finally after tossing\nand turning for a while, she fell asleep.</p><p>*</p><p>Y/N slowly walked through the busy street as she saw the very familiar sign\nof \u2018Zonko\u2019s Coffee\u2019 on the other side of the road. She crossed the road on\nsignal and entered the cafe. The familier scent of coffee beans filled Y/N\u2019s\nnostril making her remember all the times she had gone there with Harry. Y/N\nremembered their very first meeting and she remembered the time when she went\nhome after waiting for him for two hours on their fifth anniversary.</p><p>Suddenly her stomach turned and the only thing she wanted to do was curl in\nher bed with her cat, Ginger and watch Netflix. Y/N looked at their usual seat\nthen around the cafe, he hadn\u2019t come yet, if she wanted she could easily go\nback home and send him a massage saying she couldn\u2019t make it. However, she\ndecided otherwise, she wasn\u2019t going to chicken out just like that.</p><p>She walked up to the counter and stood in the line. There were only two\npeople in front of her. Y/N looked back at the door again for any sign of\nHarry, but he wasn\u2019t there yet. Y/N was nervous and out of habit she started to\nunconsciously play with her fingers until her turn came.</p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d Sasha, the accountant said amused. She was clearly not\nexpecting to see her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sasha,\u201d Y/N replied with a polite smile.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see you here in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just ya know don\u2019t really get the time,\u201d Y/N lied.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBusy life huh, should come once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d Sasha still had her smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Y/N said with a smile matching hers.</p><p>\u201cIs Harry coming or it\u2019s just you?\u201d Sasha asked as she typed away\non her computer.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah he is coming,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWant to order for him?\u201d</p><p>Y/N debated in her mind before saying he\u2019d have the usual too. Sasha smiled to\nthat and made her bill. After paying for the bills Y/N went to seat at their\nusual seat -at the corner of the room next to window.</p><p>Y/N sighed as she sat down, resting her head in her hand looking out of the\nwindow. She hated to be there, it just bought so many memories back. Y/N still\nremembered the first time they kissed, seating on that very seat; she was so\nhappy then; he made her so happy.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>She shook her head.

For some reason, Y/N prominently heard it, she felt as if the\nbusy chattering in the coffee completely stopped and the only thing making any\nsound at all was the bell. Y/N quickly looked up from her phone\u2026.It was him,\nlooking straight at her with her green orbs.</p><p>Y/N let out a breath. Seeing him after so long, felt different to her, the\nfeeling was unfamiliar to her. It wasn\u2019t like the times he came back from tour,\nit was different -but whatever the feeling was it felt good, it felt so good.</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes, she noticed were lighter shade of green that day.

Y/N\u2019s eyes\ntravelled down to his parted lips and then Y/N had this huge urge to press her\nlips onto his.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>Harry\u2019s voice rang in her ears bringing her back to reality. Everything was\nnormal again, everyone was moving around her; the clock was ticking and she\nremembered she had a boy friend and she remembered what he said.</p><p>Y/N quickly looked down at her phone sending a \u2018ttyl\u2019 to her sister. By the\ntime Y/N shoved her phone back into her bag Harry had already taken a seat\nacross her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Y/N looked up at him, as she tugged a strand of hair behind\nher ears. God, she was nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said as Y/N could tell he was studying her face.</p><p>\u201cGood, you tell?\u201d she pushed the cup of black coffee Sasha served\nher just few minutes ago towards him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, uh, I - I could\u2019ve been better,\u201d he stuttered scratching\nthe back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you call me last night, after a year?\u201d Y/N said after\na while.</p><p>\u201cUh, I,\u201d Harry let out an audible sigh. \u201c Y/N, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m\nso fucking sorry. I didn\u2019t know what I was saying. I loved you, who am I\nkidding? I love you, I love you so fucking much. I was an ass, but I promise I\ndidn\u2019t mean what I said, how could I? You\u2019re my everything and you made me so\nhappy,\u201d Harry rambled, his voice became heavier and heavier as his eyes\nbecame watery.</p><p>\u201cWhy now? After a year?\u201d Y/N said again, he voice cold but her\neyes were watery too.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d Harry looked down at his coffee. \u201cI won Grammys\nlast, and-and looking at it just made me realize it was nothing without you,\nI\u2019m nothing without you, my love.\u201d</p><p>But, Y/N wasn\u2019t listening. Her mind was stuck at 'I won Grammys\u2019.</p><p>\u201cYou won Grammys?\u201d She blurted out her face almost breaking into a\nsmile.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, still looking down at his coffee. He was about\nto speak again but Y/N cut him off.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked her voice laced with excitement. Harry\nfinally looked up and he was quite shocked to see Y/N\u2019s eyes sparkle and a grin\non her face, but he couldn\u2019t be more thankful - it was a blessing to see her\nlike that.</p><p>\u201cWhat category?\u201d Y/N asked again, but louder that time. Then it\nhit him, she was happy for him, she was happy that Harry won the Grammy, she\nhappy for him even after what he did to her. If Harry didn\u2019t already feel like\nshit, he surely did then.</p><p>\u201cUh, best rock song,\u201d he said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cWhich song?\u201d Y/N\u2019s voice still excited.</p><p>\u201cSign of the times.\u201d</p><p>Y/N\u2019s face suddenly fell. She hadn\u2019t heard it and she remembered why she\nhadn\u2019t bothered to hear it.</p><p>Y/N took a sip of her coffee. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you! It was the only thing\nyou ever wanted,\u201d she gave him a huge smile before looking down at her\ncoffee as she played with the straw.</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while before he started softly. \u201cIt means\nnothing without you, please give me a chance I\u2019ll prove myself to you. I\npromise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Y/N trailed off. \u201cYou know you hurt me so much. I\nwaited for you, you know. Just one call, I wasn\u2019t even hoping for an apologyi\njust wanted you to call me and just check on me and just show that you cared.\nBut you never did. You made me believe you truly regretted asking me out and\nthat I made your life miserable\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N, no,\u201d Harry took her hand in his.\u201cIt was the best decision\nI ever made when I asked you out. And you could never make my life miserable,\nthey were the best time of my life. I don\u2019t know what had gotten into me, but\nplease, please give me one chance, I\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, I\u2019m with someone,\u201d Y/N\u2019s eyes were no longer bright but\nthey were filled with tears and her nose was red. Y/N looked down at their\nintertwined hands. Y/N slowly caressed his knuckles with her thumb.</p><p>Y/N didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to be with Harry, but she was scared.\nShe was so fucking scared. He hurt her so bad, she just didn\u2019t have the courage\nto risk to go through all that again.</p><p>Y/N felt a tear roll down her cheek, but she didn\u2019t bother to wipe it. She\nwas torn, between her heart and her brain. Her heart told her to leave Jake and\ngive Harry a chance where her brain told her she was being nothing but stupid\nand that he was going to hurt her again. Y/N just didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cY/N please give me one chance,\u201d Harry said softly as he wiped the\ntear from her cheek before cupping it. \u201cPlease, I love you.\u201d</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>\u201cYou are too late, Harry,\u201d Y/N pushed his hand away from her face\nand let go of his hand. She hastily got up and hung her bag over her shoulder.\n\u201cYou took too much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on your Grammy, I\u2019m really happy for you, and I mean\nit,\u201d she said one last time before marching out of the cafe leaving Harry\nalone, filled with guilt and regret for the second time.</p>",

So here&rsquo;s part 2 of So Sorry. Hope you guys like it. And pretend SOTT belongs to his second album and it won Grammy\n\nP.S: part 3 coming soon! </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;My love, I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Y/N was confused, angry, sad, thankful and guilty. She didn&rsquo;t know what to\nmake out of those five words; she didn&rsquo;t know what he meant by those five\nwords; she didnt know if he really meant them and she didn&rsquo;t know how to reply\nto them. But, she had to; she wanted to. If Y/N wanted she could&rsquo;ve easily hung\nup on him but she couldn&rsquo;t- his voice, it was just too beautiful and the sobs\ncoming out of his lips sounded too painful.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want? Why are you calling me?&rdquo; Y/N said as she got\nout of the bed pushing Jake aside before making her way down the stairs to the\nliving room.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so fucking sorry for what I said that day and what I\ndid to us, Y/N I swear I didn&rsquo;t mean it. You didn&rsquo;t make my life miserable, how\ncould you? I was just frustrated, and I let that out on you. I know that\ndoesn&rsquo;t give me an excuse but I&rsquo;m-&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N cut him off. &ldquo;Harry listen, this is not really the best time.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry spoke before she could say anything else. &ldquo;We can meet. Tomorrow?\nI can come to your place or -or you can come to mine or the Zonko&rsquo;s? We didn&rsquo;t\ngo there in ages!&rdquo; Y/N could tell Harry was hopeful, but for some reason\nit made her angry.</p><p>How could he appear in her life when she felt like she was moving on! How\ncould he appear in her life when she finally found a little happiness in\nsomeone else! It was over one year and he decided to call her only then? And it\ntook him this long just to realize what he did? Y/N wasn&rsquo;t having that. After\nshe had left him, she had completely blocked him out of her life but there was\na part which just wanted to go back to him, and she knew she would if Harry\neven tried to win her back. But, when she turned her phone back on after a week\nof hybernation in her bedroom, she was surprised he hadn&rsquo;t called her, not even\nonce.</p><p>Her heart was already broken when she heard him mumble those hurtful words\nunder his breath but when she realized he didn&rsquo;t even try to contact her at\nall, her heart shattered into millions of pieces.</p><p>At first she couldn&rsquo;t really accept it, she gave herself excuses - maybe his\ncalling her but the network is bad; maybe he tried a lot at first but just\nthought of giving her some space, but will eventually come back; maybe he just\nneeds time to clear his head. Y/N actually believed those but when she saw a\npicture of him making out with a French super model just after few weeks, she\ndidn&rsquo;t know what to believe. She didn&rsquo;t know if she should believe <i>her</i> Harry or\nthe Harry she was seeing on magazines. However, she knew about the media and\nhow they can make someone look and she knew about the all the stunts Jeff made\nhim do, so she believed in the Harry she knew. Her Harry wouldn&rsquo;t just throw\nall of the things they had just like that. But, after two months when she\ndidn&rsquo;t get any call from him, she realized he wasn&rsquo;t hers anymore.</p><p>Y/N had thrown her life away after that. She felt betrayed, she felt stupid\nand she felt numb. However, 9 months later she met Jake. Y/N knew she wasn&rsquo;t in\nlove with him and she knew he wasn&rsquo;t over him completely but Jake made her\nhappy, he made her almost forget him.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry! We can&rsquo;t meet!&rdquo; Y/N exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why? Please,&rdquo; the hope that was in his voice disappeared in\na second.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re calling me after a year, but I&rsquo;ve moved\non,&rdquo; she lied. Y/N felt even admitting her feelings for Harry meant\nbetraying Jake, and she can never do that.</p><p>Harry was silent for a while before he spoke. &ldquo;We can still meet, we\ncan clear things up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any need.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, please please I just wanna talk about few things, promise it won&rsquo;t\ntake long.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice was desperate, so desperate that Y/N almost felt\nhis life depended on her answer.</p><p>Y/N looked back at the staircase, then to the clock across the room.</p><p><i><b>12:56</b></i></p><p>Y/N let out a huff, &ldquo;fine, 4 in Zonko&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay-&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N hung up on that. She was furious. Who did he think he was! Calling her\nat the middle of the night apologizing for things he did over a year ago!</p><p>Y/N went back to her bedroom. Jake was still peacefully sleeping in the bed.\nY/N let you out a sigh. She wasn&rsquo;t doing anything wrong, they were just gonna\ntalk and start on their own life again- she told herself.</p><p>Y/N got under the comforters. However she couldn&rsquo;t sleep. She was thinking\nabout the things Harry was going to talk at Zonko&rsquo;s, she was thinking what made\nhim call after so long and she was thinking why he started to care about her\nall of a sudden.</p><p>Y/N sighed again before turning her back to Jake and finally after tossing\nand turning for a while, she fell asleep.</p><p>*</p><p>Y/N slowly walked through the busy street as she saw the very familiar sign\nof &lsquo;Zonko&rsquo;s Coffee&rsquo; on the other side of the road. She crossed the road on\nsignal and entered the cafe. The familier scent of coffee beans filled Y/N&rsquo;s\nnostril making her remember all the times she had gone there with Harry. Y/N\nremembered their very first meeting and she remembered the time when she went\nhome after waiting for him for two hours on their fifth anniversary.</p><p>Suddenly her stomach turned and the only thing she wanted to do was curl in\nher bed with her cat, Ginger and watch Netflix. Y/N looked at their usual seat\nthen around the cafe, he hadn&rsquo;t come yet, if she wanted she could easily go\nback home and send him a massage saying she couldn&rsquo;t make it. However, she\ndecided otherwise, she wasn&rsquo;t going to chicken out just like that.</p><p>She walked up to the counter and stood in the line. There were only two\npeople in front of her. Y/N looked back at the door again for any sign of\nHarry, but he wasn&rsquo;t there yet. Y/N was nervous and out of habit she started to\nunconsciously play with her fingers until her turn came.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; Sasha, the accountant said amused. She was clearly not\nexpecting to see her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Sasha,&rdquo; Y/N replied with a polite smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see you here in a long time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, just ya know don&rsquo;t really get the time,&rdquo; Y/N lied.</p><p>She smiled. &ldquo;Busy life huh, should come once in a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know. I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The usual?&rdquo; Sasha still had her smile on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Y/N said with a smile matching hers.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Harry coming or it&rsquo;s just you?&rdquo; Sasha asked as she typed away\non her computer.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, yeah he is coming,&rdquo; she said hesitantly.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to order for him?&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N debated in her mind before saying he&rsquo;d have the usual too. Sasha smiled to\nthat and made her bill. After paying for the bills Y/N went to seat at their\nusual seat -at the corner of the room next to window.</p><p>Y/N sighed as she sat down, resting her head in her hand looking out of the\nwindow. She hated to be there, it just bought so many memories back. Y/N still\nremembered the first time they kissed, seating on that very seat; she was so\nhappy then; he made her so happy.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>She shook her head. She couldn&rsquo;t think like that - not after what he made\nher go through Y/N looked away from the window and took her phone out, pushing\nall of the thoughts away.</p><p>Many people came in and went out of the small and very cozy cafe, making the\nbell hanging above the door jiggle, but Y/N didn&rsquo;t care about any of those.\nHowever, at 4:06 she was swirling the straw of her hot chocolate when the bell\njiggled again. For some reason, Y/N prominently heard it, she felt as if the\nbusy chattering in the coffee completely stopped and the only thing making any\nsound at all was the bell. Y/N quickly looked up from her phone&hellip;.It was him,\nlooking straight at her with her green orbs.</p><p>Y/N let out a breath. Seeing him after so long, felt different to her, the\nfeeling was unfamiliar to her. It wasn&rsquo;t like the times he came back from tour,\nit was different -but whatever the feeling was it felt good, it felt so good.</p><p>Harry&rsquo;s eyes, she noticed were lighter shade of green that day. Y/N stared\nat them for a while but she didn&rsquo;t know for how long. Y/N felt like time had\nstopped, no one moved and it was just them, looking at each other. Y/N&rsquo;s eyes\ntravelled down to his parted lips and then Y/N had this huge urge to press her\nlips onto his.</p><p><i>It was my biggest mistake when I asked her out, miserable five fucking\nyears.</i></p><p>Harry&rsquo;s voice rang in her ears bringing her back to reality. Everything was\nnormal again, everyone was moving around her; the clock was ticking and she\nremembered she had a boy friend and she remembered what he said.</p><p>Y/N quickly looked down at her phone sending a &lsquo;ttyl&rsquo; to her sister. By the\ntime Y/N shoved her phone back into her bag Harry had already taken a seat\nacross her.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said in a small voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Y/N looked up at him, as she tugged a strand of hair behind\nher ears. God, she was nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said as Y/N could tell he was studying her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Good, you tell?&rdquo; she pushed the cup of black coffee Sasha served\nher just few minutes ago towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, uh, I - I could&rsquo;ve been better,&rdquo; he stuttered scratching\nthe back of his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;So, why did you call me last night, after a year?&rdquo; Y/N said after\na while.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I,&rdquo; Harry let out an audible sigh. &ldquo; Y/N, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m\nso fucking sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know what I was saying. I loved you, who am I\nkidding? I love you, I love you so fucking much. I was an ass, but I promise I\ndidn&rsquo;t mean what I said, how could I? You&rsquo;re my everything and you made me so\nhappy,&rdquo; Harry rambled, his voice became heavier and heavier as his eyes\nbecame watery.</p><p>&ldquo;Why now? After a year?&rdquo; Y/N said again, he voice cold but her\neyes were watery too.</p><p>&ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; Harry looked down at his coffee. &ldquo;I won Grammys\nlast, and-and looking at it just made me realize it was nothing without you,\nI&rsquo;m nothing without you, my love.&rdquo;</p><p>But, Y/N wasn&rsquo;t listening. Her mind was stuck at 'I won Grammys&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You won Grammys?&rdquo; She blurted out her face almost breaking into a\nsmile.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Harry said, still looking down at his coffee. He was about\nto speak again but Y/N cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;What category?&rdquo; Y/N asked her voice laced with excitement. Harry\nfinally looked up and he was quite shocked to see Y/N&rsquo;s eyes sparkle and a grin\non her face, but he couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful - it was a blessing to see her\nlike that.</p><p>&ldquo;What category?&rdquo; Y/N asked again, but louder that time. Then it\nhit him, she was happy for him, she was happy that Harry won the Grammy, she\nhappy for him even after what he did to her. If Harry didn&rsquo;t already feel like\nshit, he surely did then.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, best rock song,&rdquo; he said uncertainly.</p><p>&ldquo;Which song?&rdquo; Y/N&rsquo;s voice still excited.</p><p>&ldquo;Sign of the times.&rdquo;</p><p>Y/N&rsquo;s face suddenly fell. She hadn&rsquo;t heard it and she remembered why she\nhadn&rsquo;t bothered to hear it.</p><p>Y/N took a sip of her coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you! It was the only thing\nyou ever wanted,&rdquo; she gave him a huge smile before looking down at her\ncoffee as she played with the straw.</p><p>Harry said nothing for a while before he started softly. &ldquo;It means\nnothing without you, please give me a chance I&rsquo;ll prove myself to you.

The way that Ethan said Harry&rsquo;s name - the tone and hitch, the beg were all so familiar. Ethan was talking when she tuned her senses back into the room. Harry was still above her, he hadn&rsquo;t moved so much as constricted, but he&rsquo;d shrunk out of her.</p><p>&ldquo;You must have a thing for Smiths you fucking Judas.&rdquo; The quiet broken windowpane of Ethan&rsquo;s voice ripped into Jo&rsquo;s flesh and though she was still damp, it felt like the clamminess of a grave.</p><p>What the fuck did that mean? Judas?</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking my mum?&rdquo; Ethan&rsquo;s voice went up in volume that time. Harry closed in on himself on top of her, dead weight instead of shelter.</p><p>Jo pushed at him to get him to pull his body off her, to get some fresh air. She could barely breathe, the air was fetid.</p><p>He pulled back and just before she could catch her breath his murky green eyes caught hers inside the surround of his hair and he said, &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; She realized then her cheek was wet and she wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was him or her.</p><p>Harry rolled to the side and quickly grabbed for the boxers she had removed with her feet a lifetime ago.</p><p>This was a new life.</p><p>Once he was covered a bit, Jo watched him put on something else when he took a huge breath and turned to her son, who stood seething with hands clenched in silhouetted. Harry was contrite, but stood straight and looked to where Ethan had come farther into the doorway. </p><p>Ethan&rsquo;s face broke Jo&rsquo;s heart. She could barely see anything with the light behind him and it was still all that she could see. Shattered. Jo covered herself up to her nose, but she could still smell her crime.</p><p>Harry spoke then inside the stifling air. &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not fucking your mum! I love her, she loves me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Like you loved me?&rdquo; Ethan shouted in return.</p><p>What? Jo thought. What was he talking about?</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan! You do not get to rewrite history.&rdquo; Harry was yelling back, she&rsquo;d never heard his voice like that, not even after the awards banquet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fucking rewriting history, you sick fuck. Both of us?&rdquo; Ethan started towards Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan!&rdquo; Jo uttered. He looked at her and she thought of the way his face would melt when his dad didn&rsquo;t show up before she gave up trying to facilitate a relationship all together.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that. We couldn&rsquo;t help it. We were around each other, all the time. She&rsquo;s&hellip;.&rdquo; he looked at Jo then. &ldquo;She, I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan scoffed. &ldquo;This some way to get back at me, because I didn&rsquo;t want people to call me a faggot. Wouldn&rsquo;t be with you, hold your bloody hand at college? Is this some sick way to get back at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about you at all!&rdquo; Harry stood mostly naked, sweating, maybe still from being inside of her, or from the increase in temperature in the room.</p><p>But Jo had chills.</p><p>&ldquo;It was always about me Harry, you were fucking obsessed with me.&rdquo; Ethan threw his hands up, he&rsquo;d come to the end of the bed and Jo could hear his face was red, though it was too dark to confirm.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and you felt nothing for me, Ethan!&rdquo; Harry puffed his chest up. &ldquo;Never whispered how much you wished for me into my neck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than I should have, you piece of shit. How could you? My fucking mum, she&rsquo;s all I have. You ruin fucking everything!&rdquo; Ethan&rsquo;s voice was loud, and fragile like a note held too long in the air. &ldquo;Ruined me, loving you.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh god! Jo&rsquo;s heart broke on her son&rsquo;s note. Loving you. She could totally see how loving Harry, or no longer loving him, could crack your voice. It was a peak into her near future she grieved.</p><p>Harry gnashed his teeth then. &ldquo;You never loved me, not enough. You liked the way I made you feel. But I was your fucking dirty little secret. Bit of experimentation on the side.&rdquo; He hit his chest with his palm. &ldquo;And I, I fucking followed you like a puppy and ate your scraps for years. Ages. Until I realized there were other people in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like my mum!&rdquo; Ethan screeched and Jo remembered Zoe was upstairs. She started praying she&rsquo;d sleep through or stay where she was.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not just your mum, Ethan. She&rsquo;s an entire person outside of you. A woman. She loves me more than you ever did! Makes plans with me and tells me so, and is willing to tell people. You&rsquo;d never own me, be with me out loud.&rdquo; She had agreed to all those things and the backbeat of pride Harry spoke with made her stomach roll.</p><p>Ethan rushed him angrily then. Harry stood up straight and faced him. Ready to catch or repay the coming blow. Jo thought she said stop.</p><p>Ethan&rsquo;s arms came up to grapple Harry rather than hit him. And Jo watched him deflate, the way he nuzzled into her when he told her about his mum. But when Ethan got his arms around him it changed. Was more of a hug than a blow, but no less sharp. Jo watched as Ethan struck another.</p><p>Instead of hitting him, Ethan hissed, &ldquo;Yeah but you&rsquo;re still a fucking secret, aren&rsquo;t you Harry? Never good enough to be more than a thing fucked in the dark.&rdquo;</p><p>Jo watched the glass of Harry&rsquo;s face crack, his shoulders hunched and he got his finger up into Ethan&rsquo;s face. Whatever he wanted to say, it didn&rsquo;t come out. &ldquo;Et-&rdquo; he gasped like the air was thin, Himalayan high.</p><p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s so willing to tell people? Because I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about it.&rdquo; The grin then, god, that Ethan reached for the hurt so quickly, like Jo did months ago and belittled Harry to make his point. &ldquo;Face it Harry, you are still a secret, a dirty one. My mum, like me, knows better than to tell people about being with you.&rdquo; The mocking tone in his voice hurt Jo, but the look on Harry&rsquo;s face was devastating.That&rsquo;s what really hurt, tore at her and made her stomach twist. That the sympathy for him remained through the shock.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true. She loves me, wants to have my baby,&rdquo; he shook his head back and forth.</p><p>&ldquo;You mad? She&rsquo;s too old for another child! She&rsquo;ll be 65 before it&rsquo;s at uni! And you&rsquo;re leaving the country. She doesn&rsquo;t need you. She&rsquo;s got me and Zoe, you&rsquo;re a bit of fun, Harry, like you always are. The big dick and the loving words, nobody turns those down, but never good enough to tell anybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were gonna tell you, have a dinner to tell my mum,&rdquo; his voice broke. &ldquo;I guess- I gue\u2014&rdquo; he looked at Jo and she had no idea what was on her face, but he gnashed his teeth and broke the embrace with Ethan and came to her side of the bed. Jo was still buried under the covers. &ldquo;Baby?&rdquo; He reached for her.</p><p>She recoiled, a fired gun, spent bullet. Oh God, she&rsquo;d let him in. He had just been inside of her. And she&rsquo;d pushed away her son for him. And he was a liar. Had deceived her and used her and she didn&rsquo;t know why, or what it meant. Jo&rsquo;s stomach felt like it was full of serpents.</p><p>Harry saw it, the change. &ldquo;Jo?&rdquo; He gasped her name. &ldquo;Pleas\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo; It was the first words she&rsquo;d gotten out. They were corroded. &ldquo;Get the fuck outta my house Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Jo listen\u2014-&rdquo;</p><p>She cut him off. &ldquo;Fuck you. What the fuck can you possibly say? You fucked my son and then came after me? What the fuck is wrong with you\u2014-&rdquo; she started pulling at her skin like it hurt.</p><p>She looked up at Ethan then, and his tears had dried. &ldquo;Ethan,&rdquo; she tried to go to him, but remembered her nakedness, the dried sweat and tears, and the cum cooling between her legs. She stayed on the bed and started to cry.</p><p>Ethan just looked at her, his face ragged like sandpaper had rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Jo had thought about the reasons, and in another setting they may have been worth saying, carried more than the weight of a feather on the scales: I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I love him so much. I&rsquo;ve never felt better in my skin than with him. No one ever treated me so well, loved me like that. I like me better when I&rsquo;m with him. We were undeniable. We&rsquo;re art, we are a masterpiece.</p><p>Those all remained true, but were worthless now. Because, if it was just the betrayal of sleeping with Ethan&rsquo;s mate, that would hurt, but she had believed they could move past that. But as her mind processed the last five minutes, dots connected in her mind in a haphazard line.</p><p>She and Harry had been trying to build a home on a grave.</p><p>Ethan and Harry, all those times they took forever to come down, and the tickle spots, and Harry&rsquo;s boyfriend that wouldn&rsquo;t claim him? It was her son, they were a &lsquo;them&rsquo;. Was their whole love affair a lie? Or just based on one? She couldn&rsquo;t even get her thoughts together. A game? A joke? Her son&rsquo;s lover, she retched, feeling bile in her mouth.</p><p>She wrapped the sheet around her and ran for the bathroom, emptying the quick sandwich she had eaten earlier into the toilet. She heard a ruckus over her shoulder, and looked back at the slim doorway to Ethan pushing Harry away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;She told you to fucking leave.&rdquo; Ethan came in and pulled her hair into a low ponytail, still tender even in anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo!!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice broke and it made her eyes well over again in tandem with his.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy!&rdquo; Sounded from upstairs and insult multiplied injury.</p><p>Jo pulled herself up and wanted to say something to her son. He&rsquo;d moved back from her as soon as she flushed the toilet and rose. Harry stood back from the doorway and she made herself small to go around him, so none of her would touch a bit of his skin, and closed her closet door.</p><p>She could hear noise and low tense voices while she threw on a t-shirt, careful it was hers, and sweats. When she came out, Ethan was near the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan, don&rsquo;t leave, please!&rdquo; She got out, and went towards him. Zoe&rsquo;s cries started again, louder than an alarm, and Jo looked up and down and felt torn in two.</p><p>Three if you counted the quiet sobs coming behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, get Zoe Mum, she wants you near her.&rdquo; The unspoken subtext was clear. The door closed and Jo&rsquo;s knees went weak. She folded down and would have stayed there had Harry not tried to put his hands on her. They may as well have been covered in leper&rsquo;s rags for the revulsion it caused.</p><p>The hard floorboards under her knees were smoother under her feet when she flinched away and made a move for the stairs. Running up. Her phone, she hated how far down she had to scroll down to get to Ethan&rsquo;s number in her recently called list and how large the number could be when he lived under her roof.</p><p>Her trip on the landing may have been due to her face in the screen, or the tears in her eyes, or the fact that she thought her kneecaps being broken would hurt less.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan! Please! I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; That was the first call, she assumed of many. And he shady buttoned her. Zoe was at the top of the stairs, holding the blankey she loved and used to take everywhere with white knuckles and teary eyes. She would normally have no problems coming down the stairs and getting right in the middle of the fray. Today, Zoe stood at the top step like there was a force field holding her back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy!&rdquo; She melted and Jo picked her up and the twin burying of their noses in the others neck was relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo!&rdquo; She heard behind her and the little comfort Zoe had brought slacked off her skin like water out of a gutter shoot.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t look at him. &ldquo;Get out Harry.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t yell, her voice was raw with the last twenty minutes though most of her screaming had been internal.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo, baby!&rdquo; She tensed then and did look at him and whatever was on her face, he withdrew into his skin like a chick not quite ready to leave the egg. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; It was a hiccup, wet and mucusy. &ldquo;Please let me explain.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned so Zoe couldn&rsquo;t see him. &ldquo;Get out. Don&rsquo;t come back. If you&rsquo;re not gone by the time I get downstairs, I&rsquo;m calling the police.&rdquo; Her voice was flat, like a dry lake bed.</p><p>Harry just looked at her, he didn&rsquo;t even have to blink for the tears to run out. When he finally did close his eyes, it was in defeat. His posture was never good, but he wasn&rsquo;t a recalcitrant knight now, but one who&rsquo;d lost the holy land.</p><p>Jo heard the door shut, and it was the first pang of heartbreak she&rsquo;d felt over the disgust. </p><p>No, she wasn&rsquo;t gonna be sad about him. Miss him. He was a liar. He&rsquo;d lied to her for ages, maybe by omission, but a relationship, a sexual one, with her son, was a life-changing, relationship precluding situation.</p><p>He was a betrayer. Ethan and her. Ethan seemed so hurt by Harry being with her. And it was Harry who had hurt him. Jo could cut all ties to Harry, they could remove him from their life, she and Ethan and Zoe, the Brutus who had stabbed them in the back at the same time, same knife.</p><p>But she had to get to her son. Ethan had to listen. To forgive her. The rational side of her, the one she had not been listening to for nearly six months told her to calm down and give him time.</p><p>The mum, who&rsquo;d seen the cracks and fissures of water snake down his face, couldn&rsquo;t. This wasn&rsquo;t like the time she wasn&rsquo;t able to come to his footie awards because of the department meeting and the traffic an accident caused, blocking the only way home. Ethan had been so sad, he&rsquo;d been sad with Anne and Harry. God, she couldn&rsquo;t again.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why this was so different. Jo had done her best to get to him that time, to be in the audience, and he&rsquo;d not been alone. He was alone this time.</p><p>Because she had taken something from him, his support system, her and his best mate, or lover, or&hellip;?</p><p>By the time she was in the truck she was crying again. What kind of mother was she?</p><p>The kind that dragged her three year old out into the dark to chase down the one she&rsquo;d betrayed. That knife was in her hand too.</p><p>Zoe nodded off quickly, it was dark and still and a new day, but no one had told the sun that as it still sat below the horizon and had yet to rear its golden head. She hoped she beat the dawn, that she didn&rsquo;t have to watch the light break across the sky. It would be tainted, maybe forever now. &ldquo;Fuck you Styles.&rdquo;</p><p>Zoe had tear tracks dried on her face and her blankey clutched tightly when she got to Ethan&rsquo;s student apartment. But she stayed asleep, cuddled into her mother&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>Because she didn&rsquo;t know. She had no idea what Jo had done, and only saw her as a source of comfort and rest. Zoe didn&rsquo;t know what last night was about and Jo hoped she never did. She hoped she was light in the eyes of one of her children for a little longer at least.</p><p>She knocked for a while. The curtain near the door rustled and her own eyes, she assumed hers were just as red, looked out at her. They tightened at the edges. The light was changing and Jo wanted to get inside as soon as she could, like if the weak sunshine touched her, it would give her a sickness.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only letting you in because you have her. Figure out the couch bed, I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo; Ethan sounded much colder than even when she hadn&rsquo;t let him go to the team trips when he was 15 years old. He&rsquo;d not been showing great judgement, which was ironic currently, and she didn&rsquo;t think Germany without her was a great idea. He&rsquo;d been awful to her for the lead up, duration, and aftermath of the trip.</p><p>This time she deserved it. She bit her lip to keep all her words from spilling out as it looked like he was entirely unready for her to approach the subject, and time to cool the anger and hurt was a good thing. But she had to say something.</p><p>She lay Zoe on the couch and turned towards the kitchen where he was grabbing the cuppa he must have made when he got in. He couldn&rsquo;t have beat her by much.</p><p>She got slightly closer and Ethan held up a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t now Mum.&rdquo; His voice broke.</p><p>She nodded and bit her lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning. Well, more morning.&rdquo; He tried to fake a smile for her and straightened his shoulders to walk passed her. She almost grabbed him. To hold him to her. But she let him go. But as he walked through his bed room door she realized he had left her a cup brewing as well. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Ethan.&rdquo; It was all she could get out.</p><p>He looked back, anguished. &ldquo;I love you, Mum.&rdquo; He coughed and closed the door. </p><p>Though it might have been a comfort, Jo found herself crying over it, and that he poured her tea. He was the best boy. She did not deserve him. It was bitter, he&rsquo;d put no sugar in, or honey, but his words and the gesture were sweet enough that she swallowed the whole cup in two gulps.</p><p>She located a shower, because she was certain she wouldn&rsquo;t sleep until she had rinsed her sins away, and laid down curled around Zoe with her back off the edge of the couch.</p><p>Jo knew her rest would be fitful and rough at best, nightmare filled at worst. She tried though, so she could organize her case, though she knew she was guilty, into something sympathetic at the very least the next day. Maybe she&rsquo;d get manslaughter rather than emotional murder. She had some time to serve though.</p><p>Zoe stirred when the day was late. It was hard to tell because it was cloudy and Jo was thankful. The sun had no place in her life today. The grey was what she could handle.</p><p>Ethan appeared at eleven and Jo was laying breakfast out for him and Zoe.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, I made pancakes.&rdquo; Not waffles. &ldquo;Do you have work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. And not 'til three.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk? Or after?&rdquo; She begged.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but.&rdquo; He went passed her and let their shoulders brush and she could breathe again. &ldquo;Mum&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I can today. I need a bit more time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, um ok, I guess I should have not followed you and made you talk to me, but I just couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she shivered. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay and be where&hellip;&rdquo; she rocked in a breath. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be there, where&hellip;.&rdquo; Why couldn&rsquo;t she say it?</p><p>&ldquo;Where Harry had been, where you had been with him?&rdquo; He supplied and she felt tears slip down her cheeks. &ldquo;Me either. Can you stay until tomorrow, and I&rsquo;ll try to put on my big boy pants and get ready to talk to you. I actually had come home because I had some things to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of them spoke about why that never happened. In fact, they just spent the day pretending that nothing was amiss, keeping distance and focusing on Zoe. It felt so much like her times with Colin that her skin was crawling.</p><p>Their behavior was reminiscent of her divorce, but you can&rsquo;t divorce your son. And lord knew that she had no interest in disowning him. She hoped he felt the same. Her optimism there was shaky, but its foundations built itself up every hour he let her hang around. He let her in last night because it was late and she had Zoe, but today she could safely leave at any time.</p><p>Ethan wanted to talk to her. Jo had no idea what she was gonna say.</p><p>So that night while he was at work, she rummaged a bottle of wine up and went into her trunk to find some supplies. Jo stared at the canvas until her bottle was nearly dry and found herself crying. The beat she put on the canvas was rolling itself into a big ball and coming at her, like her hopes and dreams had twisted into something painful Her woman was at the bottom of the painting trying to outrun what her creation had become.</p><p>She was still sitting at the canvas she&rsquo;d propped up over kitchen roll on her empty bottle. And her lady was just about out of room to run.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo; Ethan whisper shouted and she looked up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost three am. Go to bed.&rdquo; He touched her to help her up and wiped away her tears without comment. She let his mildewing eyes pass as well. But she couldn&rsquo;t help but hug him. He hugged her back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pissed with you.&rdquo; He bittered into her neck. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m pissed at me too, because had I ever been able to be honest with you, we may not be in this situation.&rdquo; He sounded like he was talking from the bottom of a well.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we both know who the liar is here!&rdquo; Her sentence sounded like a curse word. All at him. How the fuck was she missing him?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m, fuck I,&rdquo; he sat on the couch and looked around. &ldquo;Zoe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in your bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll cuddle her tonight. Think I need it.&rdquo; He exhaled, and looked at her with still humid eyes. &ldquo;I could kill him Mum. But, he was also keeping my secret, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>Jo shook her head at that. &ldquo;What secret is worth this? Such a big lie!&rdquo; She boggled.</p><p>Ethan gnashed his teeth and closed his eyes, looked down then said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay Mum.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, she&rsquo;d surmised as much from the fight Harry and Ethan had had. Or that her son was some variation of not straight. The impact was soft. The revelation he feared so much didn&rsquo;t change how she loved him, and while she took in the shapes of face, she remembered the youthful round chubbiness of him as a toddler, and the lean pride of busy elementary Ethan, the awkward spots of puberty, and the squareness of beginning adulthood. He was her Ethan, whoever he loved.</p><p>She wanted to be upset he hadn&rsquo;t told her. But this was not about her at all. So she tried to focus on him, and put her hand on his knee. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; she started with. &ldquo;I love you. However you are. However you&rsquo;ve been, with whoever.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan just looked at her and folded himself into her lap. It was a feat, he was almost six feet tall. She wrapped her arms around him and felt him tense and then sob for just a minute while he began talking.</p><p>&ldquo;And I knew that, that that would be how you would respond. I&rsquo;m so fucking livid that I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out. I think I&rsquo;ve ruined at least three relationships because I&rsquo;m ashamed of who I am.&rdquo; By the time he reached the end he&rsquo;d exhaled though, and some of the god awful tension he&rsquo;d held was sucked into the vent.</p><p>&ldquo;What relationships?&rdquo; She bit her lip, please don&rsquo;t mean us, she thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, definitely me and Harry. I want to fucking kill him.&rdquo; He balled his fists and sat up, his tears gone now. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been over for ages, because he was so pushy, always pushing me for more, and never satisfied.&rdquo; Yeah, she knew that about him. &ldquo;So fucking insecure. But we were able to be friends, but I can&rsquo;t even look at him now. Think I&rsquo;d punch him in the face.&rdquo;</p><p>She mmmhmmm&rsquo;d encouragingly. She wanted to slap him herself. And then&hellip;. would the longing ever fade. She stopped herself from slouching to ruin and refocused.</p><p>&ldquo;And Sean and me.&rdquo; He swallowed and Jo remembered the tall sweet boy she&rsquo;d met only a couple weeks ago. That made sense. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so. He&rsquo;s so mad at me. Just like Harry was. Won&rsquo;t talk to me. I just want him to talk to me.&rdquo; His sentences were clipped and quiet. &ldquo;I just miss him tal&hellip;I just miss him.&rdquo; He looked up are her then.</p><p>&ldquo;Sean&rsquo;s your someone, then?&rdquo; Jo caught his eyes and smoothed his hair back.</p><p>Her son bit his lip and nodded. The honesty though, had loosened the lines around his eyes, and his temples were smooth now. Jo adopted the lightness.</p><p>&ldquo;Good on you. He&rsquo;s cute! Can I meet him tomorrow?&rdquo; What she was really asking was, am I allowed to? Are you too mad at me?</p><p>&ldquo;He hates that I wouldn&rsquo;t meet his family last week.&rdquo; God, last week, Jo thought.. &ldquo;And that when I introduced him to you I didn&rsquo;t really introduce him to you. May be too little, too late now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think he will get over it. He&rsquo;s hurt, nobody likes to feel like the person they love is ashamed of them.&rdquo; They shared a sympathetic look.</p><p>&ldquo;And you and Harry. Imagine that&rsquo;s well over now. Not that I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He looked liked he&rsquo;d eaten a bitter lemon.</p><p>Jo suddenly felt her tears rush back. She was sorry. How cruel, to be so close to something great and find out its foundations were rotting. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;.don&rsquo;t even want to see him.&rdquo; It was all she could say about that. &ldquo;And the last relationship?&rdquo; There was only one dyad left. \u00a0Ethan was being so nice. But just a day ago, he&rsquo;d been rightfully livid and nearly kicked her off his doorstep.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno Mum?&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really mad at you, and you knew I&rsquo;d be upset about it, but you carried on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought, well, I, couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; She took his hand. &ldquo;None of it sounds like more than dust in the wind now. I thought you&rsquo;d be mad and then accept it. You kept going on about how happy I looked.&rdquo; She pursed her mouth, can a lie still make you happy? &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d be happy for us. But I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; That came out harsh and bitter.</p><p>&ldquo;I know Mum. And if he wasn&rsquo;t what he was to me, I dunno, maybe you&rsquo;d be right.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; He looked at her face then.</p><p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re alright. If you can forgive me for lying and keeping secrets\u2014&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was doing the same thing.&rdquo; Ethan conceded.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be alright. And I want to meet Sean. You should try to work it out.&rdquo; Jo sighed, somebody should get their happy ending. \u00a0Sean seemed the real innocent here. He deserved it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, ok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go call him.&rdquo; Jo nudged him when he stood and he smiled and her heart stitched itself back together a little at the tippy top.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t sleep. Jo lay in bed and felt like she was in an Iron Maiden, or wished she had been one. Had she been cold and contained sharp edges, maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t feel like her skin was covered in cuts. At least she wouldn&rsquo;t know what her skin was capable of feeling like, like it glowed and everywhere he touched you could see the light. The contrast was painful.</p><p>The worst part was that she wanted Harry. At night, on Ethan&rsquo;s couch, she wanted to wake up to his feet shuffling and his arms with their black etchings wrapped round her. The cycle went like this. She&rsquo;d hold still on the couch, close her eyes and flash to the scene in her bedroom just a day ago. The humiliation and confusion. Her need for comfort would well up and her Judas heart would call for Harry.</p><p>Harry who had a knack for texting or trying to ring her whenever a residue of sympathy clung to her. She&rsquo;d had to shut off her phone.</p><p>Then she would focus on her son&rsquo;s face and her own hurt. He&rsquo;d lied, this whole time. Could you love somebody you kept such a secret from? Then she would realize she&rsquo;d kept a secret just like it from Ethan. She had so many questions.</p><p>Then she would try to sleep, and it would begin all again.</p><p>The next day she knew she looked thin-skinned. Ethan had made her tea, though he was the injured party, and Sean, lovely Sean, had held her a little long and the strong hand up and down her back had made tears well up. </p><p>Ethan and Sean looked good together. And Sean looked over the moon to be the boyfriend and not the friend. Once Sean and Ethan were snuggled up in the pub booth and Zoe was playing and Jo was avoiding alcohol because she had a drive, she found herself in a familiar place.</p><p>Jo stood before the mirror and stared at the lone middle-aged woman looking back at her. Alone again, after months of partnership. Her picker was horribly broken. It was time to set aside her hopes for companionship, it never worked out. Also, time to set aside the woman Harry saw her as.</p><p>Jo liked her better.</p><p>Now, she was as much a facade as Harry&rsquo;s apparent love.</p><p>Why?</p><p>His motivations plagued her. Was it all a joke? Some sick interest in hurting Ethan, being Ethan? Did it have anything to do with her?</p><p>Did he love her at all? The version of her that was his?</p><p>By herself, all the questions she had piled up like logs on a river, but she&rsquo;d not ask them, she&rsquo;d have to live with the emotional dam. That part of her stayed upriver.</p><p>The drive home was horrible. Because Zoe slept in the back, she couldn&rsquo;t turn up the music loud enough to drown out the voices, the ones with all the questions. They were loud.</p><p>But the answers were on her doorstep, sat in the dark. And he looked like a daydream.</p><p>A beautiful nightmare.</p>",

She could barely breathe, the air was fetid.</p><p>He pulled back and just before she could catch her breath his murky green eyes caught hers inside the surround of his hair and he said, \u201cSorry.\u201d She realized then her cheek was wet and she wasn\u2019t sure whether it was him or her.</p><p>Harry rolled to the side and quickly grabbed for the boxers she had removed with her feet a lifetime ago.</p><p>This was a new life.</p><p>Once he was covered a bit, Jo watched him put on something else when he took a huge breath and turned to her son, who stood seething with hands clenched in silhouetted. Harry was contrite, but stood straight and looked to where Ethan had come farther into the doorway. </p><p>Ethan\u2019s face broke Jo\u2019s heart. She could barely see anything with the light behind him and it was still all that she could see. Shattered. Jo covered herself up to her nose, but she could still smell her crime.</p><p>Harry spoke then inside the stifling air. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not fucking your mum! I love her, she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Like you loved me?\u201d Ethan shouted in return.</p><p>What? Jo thought. What was he talking about?</p><p>\u201cEthan! You do not get to rewrite history.\u201d Harry was yelling back, she\u2019d never heard his voice like that, not even after the awards banquet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking rewriting history, you sick fuck. Both of us?\u201d Ethan started towards Harry.</p><p>\u201cEthan!\u201d Jo uttered. He looked at her and she thought of the way his face would melt when his dad didn\u2019t show up before she gave up trying to facilitate a relationship all together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. We couldn\u2019t help it. We were around each other, all the time. She\u2019s\u2026.\u201d he looked at Jo then. \u201cShe, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan scoffed. \u201cThis some way to get back at me, because I didn\u2019t want people to call me a faggot. Wouldn\u2019t be with you, hold your bloody hand at college? Is this some sick way to get back at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about you at all!\u201d Harry stood mostly naked, sweating, maybe still from being inside of her, or from the increase in temperature in the room.</p><p>But Jo had chills.</p><p>\u201cIt was always about me Harry, you were fucking obsessed with me.\u201d Ethan threw his hands up, he\u2019d come to the end of the bed and Jo could hear his face was red, though it was too dark to confirm.</p><p>\u201cOh, and you felt nothing for me, Ethan!\u201d Harry puffed his chest up. \u201cNever whispered how much you wished for me into my neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I should have, you piece of shit. How could you? My fucking mum, she\u2019s all I have. You ruin fucking everything!\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice was loud, and fragile like a note held too long in the air. \u201cRuined me, loving you.\u201d</p><p>Oh god! Jo\u2019s heart broke on her son\u2019s note. Loving you. She could totally see how loving Harry, or no longer loving him, could crack your voice. It was a peak into her near future she grieved.</p><p>Harry gnashed his teeth then. \u201cYou never loved me, not enough. You liked the way I made you feel. But I was your fucking dirty little secret. Bit of experimentation on the side.\u201d He hit his chest with his palm. \u201cAnd I, I fucking followed you like a puppy and ate your scraps for years. Ages. Until I realized there were other people in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my mum!\u201d Ethan screeched and Jo remembered Zoe was upstairs. She started praying she\u2019d sleep through or stay where she was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just your mum, Ethan. She\u2019s an entire person outside of you. A woman. She loves me more than you ever did! Makes plans with me and tells me so, and is willing to tell people. You\u2019d never own me, be with me out loud.\u201d She had agreed to all those things and the backbeat of pride Harry spoke with made her stomach roll.</p><p>Ethan rushed him angrily then. Harry stood up straight and faced him. Ready to catch or repay the coming blow. Jo thought she said stop.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s arms came up to grapple Harry rather than hit him. And Jo watched him deflate, the way he nuzzled into her when he told her about his mum. But when Ethan got his arms around him it changed. Was more of a hug than a blow, but no less sharp. Jo watched as Ethan struck another.</p><p>Instead of hitting him, Ethan hissed, \u201cYeah but you\u2019re still a fucking secret, aren\u2019t you Harry? Never good enough to be more than a thing fucked in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Jo watched the glass of Harry\u2019s face crack, his shoulders hunched and he got his finger up into Ethan\u2019s face. Whatever he wanted to say, it didn\u2019t come out. \u201cEt-\u201d he gasped like the air was thin, Himalayan high.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s so willing to tell people? Because I\u2019ve heard nothing about it.\u201d The grin then, god, that Ethan reached for the hurt so quickly, like Jo did months ago and belittled Harry to make his point. \u201cFace it Harry, you are still a secret, a dirty one. My mum, like me, knows better than to tell people about being with you.\u201d The mocking tone in his voice hurt Jo, but the look on Harry\u2019s face was devastating.That\u2019s what really hurt, tore at her and made her stomach twist. That the sympathy for him remained through the shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true. She loves me, wants to have my baby,\u201d he shook his head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYou mad? She\u2019s too old for another child! She\u2019ll be 65 before it\u2019s at uni! And you\u2019re leaving the country. She doesn\u2019t need you. She\u2019s got me and Zoe, you\u2019re a bit of fun, Harry, like you always are. The big dick and the loving words, nobody turns those down, but never good enough to tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were gonna tell you, have a dinner to tell my mum,\u201d his voice broke. \u201cI guess- I gue\u2014\u201d he looked at Jo and she had no idea what was on her face, but he gnashed his teeth and broke the embrace with Ethan and came to her side of the bed. Jo was still buried under the covers. \u201cBaby?\u201d He reached for her.</p><p>She recoiled, a fired gun, spent bullet. Oh God, she\u2019d let him in. He had just been inside of her. And she\u2019d pushed away her son for him. And he was a liar. Had deceived her and used her and she didn\u2019t know why, or what it meant. Jo\u2019s stomach felt like it was full of serpents.</p><p>Harry saw it, the change. \u201cJo?\u201d He gasped her name. \u201cPleas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d It was the first words she\u2019d gotten out. They were corroded. \u201cGet the fuck outta my house Harry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jo listen\u2014-\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cFuck you. What the fuck can you possibly say? You fucked my son and then came after me? What the fuck is wrong with you\u2014-\u201d she started pulling at her skin like it hurt.</p><p>She looked up at Ethan then, and his tears had dried. \u201cEthan,\u201d she tried to go to him, but remembered her nakedness, the dried sweat and tears, and the cum cooling between her legs. She stayed on the bed and started to cry.</p><p>Ethan just looked at her, his face ragged like sandpaper had rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Jo had thought about the reasons, and in another setting they may have been worth saying, carried more than the weight of a feather on the scales: I couldn\u2019t help it. I love him so much. I\u2019ve never felt better in my skin than with him. No one ever treated me so well, loved me like that. I like me better when I\u2019m with him. We were undeniable. We\u2019re art, we are a masterpiece.</p><p>Those all remained true, but were worthless now. Because, if it was just the betrayal of sleeping with Ethan\u2019s mate, that would hurt, but she had believed they could move past that. But as her mind processed the last five minutes, dots connected in her mind in a haphazard line.</p><p>She and Harry had been trying to build a home on a grave.</p><p>Ethan and Harry, all those times they took forever to come down, and the tickle spots, and Harry\u2019s boyfriend that wouldn\u2019t claim him? It was her son, they were a \u2018them\u2019. Was their whole love affair a lie? Or just based on one? She couldn\u2019t even get her thoughts together. A game? A joke? Her son\u2019s lover, she retched, feeling bile in her mouth.</p><p>She wrapped the sheet around her and ran for the bathroom, emptying the quick sandwich she had eaten earlier into the toilet. She heard a ruckus over her shoulder, and looked back at the slim doorway to Ethan pushing Harry away from her.</p><p>\u201cShe told you to fucking leave.\u201d Ethan came in and pulled her hair into a low ponytail, still tender even in anger.</p><p>\u201cJo!!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice broke and it made her eyes well over again in tandem with his.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d Sounded from upstairs and insult multiplied injury.</p><p>Jo pulled herself up and wanted to say something to her son. He\u2019d moved back from her as soon as she flushed the toilet and rose. Harry stood back from the doorway and she made herself small to go around him, so none of her would touch a bit of his skin, and closed her closet door.</p><p>She could hear noise and low tense voices while she threw on a t-shirt, careful it was hers, and sweats. When she came out, Ethan was near the door.</p><p>\u201cEthan, don\u2019t leave, please!\u201d She got out, and went towards him. Zoe\u2019s cries started again, louder than an alarm, and Jo looked up and down and felt torn in two.</p><p>Three if you counted the quiet sobs coming behind her.</p><p>\u201cGo, get Zoe Mum, she wants you near her.\u201d The unspoken subtext was clear. The door closed and Jo\u2019s knees went weak. She folded down and would have stayed there had Harry not tried to put his hands on her. They may as well have been covered in leper\u2019s rags for the revulsion it caused.</p><p>The hard floorboards under her knees were smoother under her feet when she flinched away and made a move for the stairs. Running up. Her phone, she hated how far down she had to scroll down to get to Ethan\u2019s number in her recently called list and how large the number could be when he lived under her roof.</p><p>Her trip on the landing may have been due to her face in the screen, or the tears in her eyes, or the fact that she thought her kneecaps being broken would hurt less.</p><p>\u201cEthan! Please! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d That was the first call, she assumed of many. And he shady buttoned her. Zoe was at the top of the stairs, holding the blankey she loved and used to take everywhere with white knuckles and teary eyes. She would normally have no problems coming down the stairs and getting right in the middle of the fray. Today, Zoe stood at the top step like there was a force field holding her back.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d She melted and Jo picked her up and the twin burying of their noses in the others neck was relief.</p><p>\u201cJo!\u201d She heard behind her and the little comfort Zoe had brought slacked off her skin like water out of a gutter shoot.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cGet out Harry.\u201d She didn\u2019t yell, her voice was raw with the last twenty minutes though most of her screaming had been internal.</p><p>\u201cJo, baby!\u201d She tensed then and did look at him and whatever was on her face, he withdrew into his skin like a chick not quite ready to leave the egg. \u201cSorry,\u201d It was a hiccup, wet and mucusy. \u201cPlease let me explain.\u201d</p><p>She turned so Zoe couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cGet out. Don\u2019t come back. If you\u2019re not gone by the time I get downstairs, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Her voice was flat, like a dry lake bed.</p><p>Harry just looked at her, he didn\u2019t even have to blink for the tears to run out. When he finally did close his eyes, it was in defeat. His posture was never good, but he wasn\u2019t a recalcitrant knight now, but one who\u2019d lost the holy land.</p><p>Jo heard the door shut, and it was the first pang of heartbreak she\u2019d felt over the disgust. </p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t gonna be sad about him. Miss him. He was a liar. He\u2019d lied to her for ages, maybe by omission, but a relationship, a sexual one, with her son, was a life-changing, relationship precluding situation.</p><p>He was a betrayer. Ethan and her. Ethan seemed so hurt by Harry being with her. And it was Harry who had hurt him. Jo could cut all ties to Harry, they could remove him from their life, she and Ethan and Zoe, the Brutus who had stabbed them in the back at the same time, same knife.</p><p>But she had to get to her son. Ethan had to listen. To forgive her. The rational side of her, the one she had not been listening to for nearly six months told her to calm down and give him time.</p><p>The mum, who\u2019d seen the cracks and fissures of water snake down his face, couldn\u2019t. This wasn\u2019t like the time she wasn\u2019t able to come to his footie awards because of the department meeting and the traffic an accident caused, blocking the only way home. Ethan had been so sad, he\u2019d been sad with Anne and Harry. God, she couldn\u2019t again.</p><p>That\u2019s why this was so different. Jo had done her best to get to him that time, to be in the audience, and he\u2019d not been alone. He was alone this time.</p><p>Because she had taken something from him, his support system, her and his best mate, or lover, or\u2026?</p><p>By the time she was in the truck she was crying again. What kind of mother was she?</p><p>The kind that dragged her three year old out into the dark to chase down the one she\u2019d betrayed. That knife was in her hand too.</p><p>Zoe nodded off quickly, it was dark and still and a new day, but no one had told the sun that as it still sat below the horizon and had yet to rear its golden head. She hoped she beat the dawn, that she didn\u2019t have to watch the light break across the sky. It would be tainted, maybe forever now. \u201cFuck you Styles.\u201d</p><p>Zoe had tear tracks dried on her face and her blankey clutched tightly when she got to Ethan\u2019s student apartment. But she stayed asleep, cuddled into her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t know. She had no idea what Jo had done, and only saw her as a source of comfort and rest. Zoe didn\u2019t know what last night was about and Jo hoped she never did. She hoped she was light in the eyes of one of her children for a little longer at least.</p><p>She knocked for a while. The curtain near the door rustled and her own eyes, she assumed hers were just as red, looked out at her. They tightened at the edges. The light was changing and Jo wanted to get inside as soon as she could, like if the weak sunshine touched her, it would give her a sickness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only letting you in because you have her. Figure out the couch bed, I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d Ethan sounded much colder than even when she hadn\u2019t let him go to the team trips when he was 15 years old. He\u2019d not been showing great judgement, which was ironic currently, and she didn\u2019t think Germany without her was a great idea. He\u2019d been awful to her for the lead up, duration, and aftermath of the trip.</p><p>This time she deserved it. She bit her lip to keep all her words from spilling out as it looked like he was entirely unready for her to approach the subject, and time to cool the anger and hurt was a good thing. But she had to say something.</p><p>She lay Zoe on the couch and turned towards the kitchen where he was grabbing the cuppa he must have made when he got in. He couldn\u2019t have beat her by much.</p><p>She got slightly closer and Ethan held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now Mum.\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>She nodded and bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Well, more morning.\u201d He tried to fake a smile for her and straightened his shoulders to walk passed her. She almost grabbed him. To hold him to her. But she let him go. But as he walked through his bed room door she realized he had left her a cup brewing as well. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Ethan.\u201d It was all she could get out.</p><p>He looked back, anguished. \u201cI love you, Mum.\u201d He coughed and closed the door. </p><p>Though it might have been a comfort, Jo found herself crying over it, and that he poured her tea. He was the best boy. She did not deserve him. It was bitter, he\u2019d put no sugar in, or honey, but his words and the gesture were sweet enough that she swallowed the whole cup in two gulps.</p><p>She located a shower, because she was certain she wouldn\u2019t sleep until she had rinsed her sins away, and laid down curled around Zoe with her back off the edge of the couch.</p><p>Jo knew her rest would be fitful and rough at best, nightmare filled at worst. She tried though, so she could organize her case, though she knew she was guilty, into something sympathetic at the very least the next day. Maybe she\u2019d get manslaughter rather than emotional murder. She had some time to serve though.</p><p>Zoe stirred when the day was late. It was hard to tell because it was cloudy and Jo was thankful. The sun had no place in her life today. The grey was what she could handle.</p><p>Ethan appeared at eleven and Jo was laying breakfast out for him and Zoe.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, I made pancakes.\u201d Not waffles. \u201cDo you have work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. And not 'til three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk? Or after?\u201d She begged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but.\u201d He went passed her and let their shoulders brush and she could breathe again. \u201cMum\u2026I don\u2019t think I can today. I need a bit more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um ok, I guess I should have not followed you and made you talk to me, but I just couldn\u2019t,\u201d she shivered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay and be where\u2026\u201d she rocked in a breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be there, where\u2026.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t she say it?</p><p>\u201cWhere Harry had been, where you had been with him?\u201d He supplied and she felt tears slip down her cheeks. \u201cMe either. Can you stay until tomorrow, and I\u2019ll try to put on my big boy pants and get ready to talk to you. I actually had come home because I had some things to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them spoke about why that never happened. In fact, they just spent the day pretending that nothing was amiss, keeping distance and focusing on Zoe. It felt so much like her times with Colin that her skin was crawling.</p><p>Their behavior was reminiscent of her divorce, but you can\u2019t divorce your son. And lord knew that she had no interest in disowning him. She hoped he felt the same. Her optimism there was shaky, but its foundations built itself up every hour he let her hang around. He let her in last night because it was late and she had Zoe, but today she could safely leave at any time.</p><p>Ethan wanted to talk to her. Jo had no idea what she was gonna say.</p><p>So that night while he was at work, she rummaged a bottle of wine up and went into her trunk to find some supplies. Jo stared at the canvas until her bottle was nearly dry and found herself crying. The beat she put on the canvas was rolling itself into a big ball and coming at her, like her hopes and dreams had twisted into something painful Her woman was at the bottom of the painting trying to outrun what her creation had become.</p><p>She was still sitting at the canvas she\u2019d propped up over kitchen roll on her empty bottle. And her lady was just about out of room to run.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Ethan whisper shouted and she looked up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost three am. Go to bed.\u201d He touched her to help her up and wiped away her tears without comment. She let his mildewing eyes pass as well. But she couldn\u2019t help but hug him. He hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pissed with you.\u201d He bittered into her neck. \u201cBut I\u2019m pissed at me too, because had I ever been able to be honest with you, we may not be in this situation.\u201d He sounded like he was talking from the bottom of a well.</p><p>\u201cI think we both know who the liar is here!\u201d Her sentence sounded like a curse word. All at him. How the fuck was she missing him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, fuck I,\u201d he sat on the couch and looked around. \u201cZoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll cuddle her tonight. Think I need it.\u201d He exhaled, and looked at her with still humid eyes. \u201cI could kill him Mum. But, he was also keeping my secret, I think.\u201d</p><p>Jo shook her head at that. \u201cWhat secret is worth this? Such a big lie!\u201d She boggled.</p><p>Ethan gnashed his teeth and closed his eyes, looked down then said. \u201cI\u2019m gay Mum.\u201d</p><p>Well, she\u2019d surmised as much from the fight Harry and Ethan had had. Or that her son was some variation of not straight. The impact was soft. The revelation he feared so much didn\u2019t change how she loved him, and while she took in the shapes of face, she remembered the youthful round chubbiness of him as a toddler, and the lean pride of busy elementary Ethan, the awkward spots of puberty, and the squareness of beginning adulthood. He was her Ethan, whoever he loved.</p><p>She wanted to be upset he hadn\u2019t told her. But this was not about her at all. So she tried to focus on him, and put her hand on his knee. \u201cOk,\u201d she started with. \u201cI love you. However you are. However you\u2019ve been, with whoever.\u201d</p><p>Ethan just looked at her and folded himself into her lap. It was a feat, he was almost six feet tall. She wrapped her arms around him and felt him tense and then sob for just a minute while he began talking.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew that, that that would be how you would respond. I\u2019m so fucking livid that I couldn\u2019t get the words out. I think I\u2019ve ruined at least three relationships because I\u2019m ashamed of who I am.\u201d By the time he reached the end he\u2019d exhaled though, and some of the god awful tension he\u2019d held was sucked into the vent.</p><p>\u201cWhat relationships?\u201d She bit her lip, please don\u2019t mean us, she thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, definitely me and Harry. I want to fucking kill him.\u201d He balled his fists and sat up, his tears gone now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over for ages, because he was so pushy, always pushing me for more, and never satisfied.\u201d Yeah, she knew that about him. \u201cSo fucking insecure. But we were able to be friends, but I can\u2019t even look at him now. Think I\u2019d punch him in the face.\u201d</p><p>She mmmhmmm\u2019d encouragingly. She wanted to slap him herself. And then\u2026. would the longing ever fade. She stopped herself from slouching to ruin and refocused.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sean and me.\u201d He swallowed and Jo remembered the tall sweet boy she\u2019d met only a couple weeks ago. That made sense. \u201cHe\u2019s so. He\u2019s so mad at me. Just like Harry was. Won\u2019t talk to me. I just want him to talk to me.\u201d His sentences were clipped and quiet. \u201cI just miss him tal\u2026I just miss him.\u201d He looked up are her then.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s your someone, then?\u201d Jo caught his eyes and smoothed his hair back.</p><p>Her son bit his lip and nodded. The honesty though, had loosened the lines around his eyes, and his temples were smooth now. Jo adopted the lightness.</p><p>\u201cGood on you. He\u2019s cute! Can I meet him tomorrow?\u201d What she was really asking was, am I allowed to? Are you too mad at me?</p><p>\u201cHe hates that I wouldn\u2019t meet his family last week.\u201d God, last week, Jo thought.. \u201cAnd that when I introduced him to you I didn\u2019t really introduce him to you. May be too little, too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he will get over it. He\u2019s hurt, nobody likes to feel like the person they love is ashamed of them.\u201d They shared a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Harry. Imagine that\u2019s well over now. Not that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked liked he\u2019d eaten a bitter lemon.</p><p>Jo suddenly felt her tears rush back. She was sorry. How cruel, to be so close to something great and find out its foundations were rotting. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026.don\u2019t even want to see him.\u201d It was all she could say about that. \u201cAnd the last relationship?\u201d There was only one dyad left. \u00a0Ethan was being so nice. But just a day ago, he\u2019d been rightfully livid and nearly kicked her off his doorstep.</p><p>\u201cI dunno Mum?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m really mad at you, and you knew I\u2019d be upset about it, but you carried on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought, well, I, couldn\u2019t,\u201d She took his hand. \u201cNone of it sounds like more than dust in the wind now. I thought you\u2019d be mad and then accept it. You kept going on about how happy I looked.\u201d She pursed her mouth, can a lie still make you happy? \u201cI hoped you\u2019d be happy for us. But I didn\u2019t know!\u201d That came out harsh and bitter.</p><p>\u201cI know Mum. And if he wasn\u2019t what he was to me, I dunno, maybe you\u2019d be right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou alright?\u201d He looked at her face then.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re alright. If you can forgive me for lying and keeping secrets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was doing the same thing.\u201d Ethan conceded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be alright. And I want to meet Sean. You should try to work it out.\u201d Jo sighed, somebody should get their happy ending. \u00a0Sean seemed the real innocent here. He deserved it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo call him.\u201d Jo nudged him when he stood and he smiled and her heart stitched itself back together a little at the tippy top.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sleep. Jo lay in bed and felt like she was in an Iron Maiden, or wished she had been one. Had she been cold and contained sharp edges, maybe she wouldn\u2019t feel like her skin was covered in cuts. At least she wouldn\u2019t know what her skin was capable of feeling like, like it glowed and everywhere he touched you could see the light. The contrast was painful.</p><p>The worst part was that she wanted Harry. At night, on Ethan\u2019s couch, she wanted to wake up to his feet shuffling and his arms with their black etchings wrapped round her. The cycle went like this. She\u2019d hold still on the couch, close her eyes and flash to the scene in her bedroom just a day ago. The humiliation and confusion. Her need for comfort would well up and her Judas heart would call for Harry.</p><p>Harry who had a knack for texting or trying to ring her whenever a residue of sympathy clung to her. She\u2019d had to shut off her phone.</p><p>Then she would focus on her son\u2019s face and her own hurt. He\u2019d lied, this whole time. Could you love somebody you kept such a secret from? Then she would realize she\u2019d kept a secret just like it from Ethan. She had so many questions.</p><p>Then she would try to sleep, and it would begin all again.</p><p>The next day she knew she looked thin-skinned. Ethan had made her tea, though he was the injured party, and Sean, lovely Sean, had held her a little long and the strong hand up and down her back had made tears well up. </p><p>Ethan and Sean looked good together. And Sean looked over the moon to be the boyfriend and not the friend. Once Sean and Ethan were snuggled up in the pub booth and Zoe was playing and Jo was avoiding alcohol because she had a drive, she found herself in a familiar place.</p><p>Jo stood before the mirror and stared at the lone middle-aged woman looking back at her. Alone again, after months of partnership. Her picker was horribly broken. It was time to set aside her hopes for companionship, it never worked out. Also, time to set aside the woman Harry saw her as.</p><p>Jo liked her better.</p><p>Now, she was as much a facade as Harry\u2019s apparent love.</p><p>Why?</p><p>His motivations plagued her. Was it all a joke? Some sick interest in hurting Ethan, being Ethan? Did it have anything to do with her?</p><p>Did he love her at all? The version of her that was his?</p><p>By herself, all the questions she had piled up like logs on a river, but she\u2019d not ask them, she\u2019d have to live with the emotional dam. That part of her stayed upriver.</p><p>The drive home was horrible. Because Zoe slept in the back, she couldn\u2019t turn up the music loud enough to drown out the voices, the ones with all the questions. They were loud.</p><p>But the answers were on her doorstep, sat in the dark. And he looked like a daydream.</p><p>A beautiful nightmare.</p></p>",

The way that Ethan said Harry\u2019s name - the tone and hitch, the beg were all so familiar. Ethan was talking when she tuned her senses back into the room. Harry was still above her, he hadn\u2019t moved so much as constricted, but he\u2019d shrunk out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a thing for Smiths you fucking Judas.\u201d The quiet broken windowpane of Ethan\u2019s voice ripped into Jo\u2019s flesh and though she was still damp, it felt like the clamminess of a grave.</p><p>What the fuck did that mean? Judas?</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking my mum?\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice went up in volume that time. Harry closed in on himself on top of her, dead weight instead of shelter.</p><p>Jo pushed at him to get him to pull his body off her, to get some fresh air. She could barely breathe, the air was fetid.</p><p>He pulled back and just before she could catch her breath his murky green eyes caught hers inside the surround of his hair and he said, \u201cSorry.\u201d She realized then her cheek was wet and she wasn\u2019t sure whether it was him or her.</p><p>Harry rolled to the side and quickly grabbed for the boxers she had removed with her feet a lifetime ago.</p><p>This was a new life.</p><p>Once he was covered a bit, Jo watched him put on something else when he took a huge breath and turned to her son, who stood seething with hands clenched in silhouetted. Harry was contrite, but stood straight and looked to where Ethan had come farther into the doorway. </p><p>Ethan\u2019s face broke Jo\u2019s heart. She could barely see anything with the light behind him and it was still all that she could see. Shattered. Jo covered herself up to her nose, but she could still smell her crime.</p><p>Harry spoke then inside the stifling air. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not fucking your mum! I love her, she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! Like you loved me?\u201d Ethan shouted in return.</p><p>What? Jo thought. What was he talking about?</p><p>\u201cEthan! You do not get to rewrite history.\u201d Harry was yelling back, she\u2019d never heard his voice like that, not even after the awards banquet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking rewriting history, you sick fuck. Both of us?\u201d Ethan started towards Harry.</p><p>\u201cEthan!\u201d Jo uttered. He looked at her and she thought of the way his face would melt when his dad didn\u2019t show up before she gave up trying to facilitate a relationship all together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. We couldn\u2019t help it. We were around each other, all the time. She\u2019s\u2026.\u201d he looked at Jo then. \u201cShe, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Ethan scoffed. \u201cThis some way to get back at me, because I didn\u2019t want people to call me a faggot. Wouldn\u2019t be with you, hold your bloody hand at college? Is this some sick way to get back at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about you at all!\u201d Harry stood mostly naked, sweating, maybe still from being inside of her, or from the increase in temperature in the room.</p><p>But Jo had chills.</p><p>\u201cIt was always about me Harry, you were fucking obsessed with me.\u201d Ethan threw his hands up, he\u2019d come to the end of the bed and Jo could hear his face was red, though it was too dark to confirm.</p><p>\u201cOh, and you felt nothing for me, Ethan!\u201d Harry puffed his chest up. \u201cNever whispered how much you wished for me into my neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I should have, you piece of shit. How could you? My fucking mum, she\u2019s all I have. You ruin fucking everything!\u201d Ethan\u2019s voice was loud, and fragile like a note held too long in the air. \u201cRuined me, loving you.\u201d</p><p>Oh god! Jo\u2019s heart broke on her son\u2019s note. Loving you. She could totally see how loving Harry, or no longer loving him, could crack your voice. It was a peak into her near future she grieved.</p><p>Harry gnashed his teeth then. \u201cYou never loved me, not enough. You liked the way I made you feel. But I was your fucking dirty little secret. Bit of experimentation on the side.\u201d He hit his chest with his palm. \u201cAnd I, I fucking followed you like a puppy and ate your scraps for years. Ages. Until I realized there were other people in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my mum!\u201d Ethan screeched and Jo remembered Zoe was upstairs. She started praying she\u2019d sleep through or stay where she was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just your mum, Ethan. She\u2019s an entire person outside of you. A woman. She loves me more than you ever did! Makes plans with me and tells me so, and is willing to tell people. You\u2019d never own me, be with me out loud.\u201d She had agreed to all those things and the backbeat of pride Harry spoke with made her stomach roll.</p><p>Ethan rushed him angrily then. Harry stood up straight and faced him. Ready to catch or repay the coming blow. Jo thought she said stop.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s arms came up to grapple Harry rather than hit him. And Jo watched him deflate, the way he nuzzled into her when he told her about his mum. But when Ethan got his arms around him it changed. Was more of a hug than a blow, but no less sharp. Jo watched as Ethan struck another.</p><p>Instead of hitting him, Ethan hissed, \u201cYeah but you\u2019re still a fucking secret, aren\u2019t you Harry? Never good enough to be more than a thing fucked in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Jo watched the glass of Harry\u2019s face crack, his shoulders hunched and he got his finger up into Ethan\u2019s face. Whatever he wanted to say, it didn\u2019t come out. \u201cEt-\u201d he gasped like the air was thin, Himalayan high.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s so willing to tell people? Because I\u2019ve heard nothing about it.\u201d The grin then, god, that Ethan reached for the hurt so quickly, like Jo did months ago and belittled Harry to make his point. \u201cFace it Harry, you are still a secret, a dirty one. My mum, like me, knows better than to tell people about being with you.\u201d The mocking tone in his voice hurt Jo, but the look on Harry\u2019s face was devastating.That\u2019s what really hurt, tore at her and made her stomach twist. That the sympathy for him remained through the shock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true. She loves me, wants to have my baby,\u201d he shook his head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cYou mad? She\u2019s too old for another child! She\u2019ll be 65 before it\u2019s at uni! And you\u2019re leaving the country. She doesn\u2019t need you. She\u2019s got me and Zoe, you\u2019re a bit of fun, Harry, like you always are. The big dick and the loving words, nobody turns those down, but never good enough to tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were gonna tell you, have a dinner to tell my mum,\u201d his voice broke. \u201cI guess- I gue\u2014\u201d he looked at Jo and she had no idea what was on her face, but he gnashed his teeth and broke the embrace with Ethan and came to her side of the bed. Jo was still buried under the covers. \u201cBaby?\u201d He reached for her.</p><p>She recoiled, a fired gun, spent bullet. Oh God, she\u2019d let him in. He had just been inside of her. And she\u2019d pushed away her son for him. And he was a liar. Had deceived her and used her and she didn\u2019t know why, or what it meant. Jo\u2019s stomach felt like it was full of serpents.</p><p>Harry saw it, the change. \u201cJo?\u201d He gasped her name. \u201cPleas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d It was the first words she\u2019d gotten out. They were corroded. \u201cGet the fuck outta my house Harry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jo listen\u2014-\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cFuck you. What the fuck can you possibly say? You fucked my son and then came after me? What the fuck is wrong with you\u2014-\u201d she started pulling at her skin like it hurt.</p><p>She looked up at Ethan then, and his tears had dried. \u201cEthan,\u201d she tried to go to him, but remembered her nakedness, the dried sweat and tears, and the cum cooling between her legs. She stayed on the bed and started to cry.</p><p>Ethan just looked at her, his face ragged like sandpaper had rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Jo had thought about the reasons, and in another setting they may have been worth saying, carried more than the weight of a feather on the scales: I couldn\u2019t help it. I love him so much. I\u2019ve never felt better in my skin than with him. No one ever treated me so well, loved me like that. I like me better when I\u2019m with him. We were undeniable. We\u2019re art, we are a masterpiece.</p><p>Those all remained true, but were worthless now. Because, if it was just the betrayal of sleeping with Ethan\u2019s mate, that would hurt, but she had believed they could move past that. But as her mind processed the last five minutes, dots connected in her mind in a haphazard line.</p><p>She and Harry had been trying to build a home on a grave.</p><p>Ethan and Harry, all those times they took forever to come down, and the tickle spots, and Harry\u2019s boyfriend that wouldn\u2019t claim him? It was her son, they were a \u2018them\u2019. Was their whole love affair a lie? Or just based on one? She couldn\u2019t even get her thoughts together. A game? A joke? Her son\u2019s lover, she retched, feeling bile in her mouth.</p><p>She wrapped the sheet around her and ran for the bathroom, emptying the quick sandwich she had eaten earlier into the toilet. She heard a ruckus over her shoulder, and looked back at the slim doorway to Ethan pushing Harry away from her.</p><p>\u201cShe told you to fucking leave.\u201d Ethan came in and pulled her hair into a low ponytail, still tender even in anger.</p><p>\u201cJo!!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice broke and it made her eyes well over again in tandem with his.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d Sounded from upstairs and insult multiplied injury.</p><p>Jo pulled herself up and wanted to say something to her son. He\u2019d moved back from her as soon as she flushed the toilet and rose. Harry stood back from the doorway and she made herself small to go around him, so none of her would touch a bit of his skin, and closed her closet door.</p><p>She could hear noise and low tense voices while she threw on a t-shirt, careful it was hers, and sweats. When she came out, Ethan was near the door.</p><p>\u201cEthan, don\u2019t leave, please!\u201d She got out, and went towards him. Zoe\u2019s cries started again, louder than an alarm, and Jo looked up and down and felt torn in two.</p><p>Three if you counted the quiet sobs coming behind her.</p><p>\u201cGo, get Zoe Mum, she wants you near her.\u201d The unspoken subtext was clear. The door closed and Jo\u2019s knees went weak. She folded down and would have stayed there had Harry not tried to put his hands on her. They may as well have been covered in leper\u2019s rags for the revulsion it caused.</p><p>The hard floorboards under her knees were smoother under her feet when she flinched away and made a move for the stairs. Running up. Her phone, she hated how far down she had to scroll down to get to Ethan\u2019s number in her recently called list and how large the number could be when he lived under her roof.</p><p>Her trip on the landing may have been due to her face in the screen, or the tears in her eyes, or the fact that she thought her kneecaps being broken would hurt less.</p><p>\u201cEthan! Please! I didn\u2019t know!\u201d That was the first call, she assumed of many. And he shady buttoned her. Zoe was at the top of the stairs, holding the blankey she loved and used to take everywhere with white knuckles and teary eyes. She would normally have no problems coming down the stairs and getting right in the middle of the fray. Today, Zoe stood at the top step like there was a force field holding her back.</p><p>\u201cMummy!\u201d She melted and Jo picked her up and the twin burying of their noses in the others neck was relief.</p><p>\u201cJo!\u201d She heard behind her and the little comfort Zoe had brought slacked off her skin like water out of a gutter shoot.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cGet out Harry.\u201d She didn\u2019t yell, her voice was raw with the last twenty minutes though most of her screaming had been internal.</p><p>\u201cJo, baby!\u201d She tensed then and did look at him and whatever was on her face, he withdrew into his skin like a chick not quite ready to leave the egg. \u201cSorry,\u201d It was a hiccup, wet and mucusy. \u201cPlease let me explain.\u201d</p><p>She turned so Zoe couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cGet out. Don\u2019t come back. If you\u2019re not gone by the time I get downstairs, I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Her voice was flat, like a dry lake bed.</p><p>Harry just looked at her, he didn\u2019t even have to blink for the tears to run out. When he finally did close his eyes, it was in defeat. His posture was never good, but he wasn\u2019t a recalcitrant knight now, but one who\u2019d lost the holy land.</p><p>Jo heard the door shut, and it was the first pang of heartbreak she\u2019d felt over the disgust. </p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t gonna be sad about him. Miss him. He was a liar. He\u2019d lied to her for ages, maybe by omission, but a relationship, a sexual one, with her son, was a life-changing, relationship precluding situation.</p><p>He was a betrayer. Ethan and her. Ethan seemed so hurt by Harry being with her. And it was Harry who had hurt him. Jo could cut all ties to Harry, they could remove him from their life, she and Ethan and Zoe, the Brutus who had stabbed them in the back at the same time, same knife.</p><p>But she had to get to her son. Ethan had to listen. To forgive her. The rational side of her, the one she had not been listening to for nearly six months told her to calm down and give him time.</p><p>The mum, who\u2019d seen the cracks and fissures of water snake down his face, couldn\u2019t. This wasn\u2019t like the time she wasn\u2019t able to come to his footie awards because of the department meeting and the traffic an accident caused, blocking the only way home. Ethan had been so sad, he\u2019d been sad with Anne and Harry. God, she couldn\u2019t again.</p><p>That\u2019s why this was so different. Jo had done her best to get to him that time, to be in the audience, and he\u2019d not been alone. He was alone this time.</p><p>Because she had taken something from him, his support system, her and his best mate, or lover, or\u2026?</p><p>By the time she was in the truck she was crying again. What kind of mother was she?</p><p>The kind that dragged her three year old out into the dark to chase down the one she\u2019d betrayed. That knife was in her hand too.</p><p>Zoe nodded off quickly, it was dark and still and a new day, but no one had told the sun that as it still sat below the horizon and had yet to rear its golden head. She hoped she beat the dawn, that she didn\u2019t have to watch the light break across the sky. It would be tainted, maybe forever now. \u201cFuck you Styles.\u201d</p><p>Zoe had tear tracks dried on her face and her blankey clutched tightly when she got to Ethan\u2019s student apartment. But she stayed asleep, cuddled into her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t know. She had no idea what Jo had done, and only saw her as a source of comfort and rest. Zoe didn\u2019t know what last night was about and Jo hoped she never did. She hoped she was light in the eyes of one of her children for a little longer at least.</p><p>She knocked for a while. The curtain near the door rustled and her own eyes, she assumed hers were just as red, looked out at her. They tightened at the edges. The light was changing and Jo wanted to get inside as soon as she could, like if the weak sunshine touched her, it would give her a sickness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only letting you in because you have her. Figure out the couch bed, I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d Ethan sounded much colder than even when she hadn\u2019t let him go to the team trips when he was 15 years old. He\u2019d not been showing great judgement, which was ironic currently, and she didn\u2019t think Germany without her was a great idea. He\u2019d been awful to her for the lead up, duration, and aftermath of the trip.</p><p>This time she deserved it. She bit her lip to keep all her words from spilling out as it looked like he was entirely unready for her to approach the subject, and time to cool the anger and hurt was a good thing. But she had to say something.</p><p>She lay Zoe on the couch and turned towards the kitchen where he was grabbing the cuppa he must have made when he got in. He couldn\u2019t have beat her by much.</p><p>She got slightly closer and Ethan held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t now Mum.\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>She nodded and bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Well, more morning.\u201d He tried to fake a smile for her and straightened his shoulders to walk passed her. She almost grabbed him. To hold him to her. But she let him go. But as he walked through his bed room door she realized he had left her a cup brewing as well. </p><p>\u201cI love you, Ethan.\u201d It was all she could get out.</p><p>He looked back, anguished. \u201cI love you, Mum.\u201d He coughed and closed the door. </p><p>Though it might have been a comfort, Jo found herself crying over it, and that he poured her tea. He was the best boy. She did not deserve him. It was bitter, he\u2019d put no sugar in, or honey, but his words and the gesture were sweet enough that she swallowed the whole cup in two gulps.</p><p>She located a shower, because she was certain she wouldn\u2019t sleep until she had rinsed her sins away, and laid down curled around Zoe with her back off the edge of the couch.</p><p>Jo knew her rest would be fitful and rough at best, nightmare filled at worst. She tried though, so she could organize her case, though she knew she was guilty, into something sympathetic at the very least the next day. Maybe she\u2019d get manslaughter rather than emotional murder. She had some time to serve though.</p><p>Zoe stirred when the day was late. It was hard to tell because it was cloudy and Jo was thankful. The sun had no place in her life today. The grey was what she could handle.</p><p>Ethan appeared at eleven and Jo was laying breakfast out for him and Zoe.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, I made pancakes.\u201d Not waffles. \u201cDo you have work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. And not 'til three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk? Or after?\u201d She begged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but.\u201d He went passed her and let their shoulders brush and she could breathe again. \u201cMum\u2026I don\u2019t think I can today. I need a bit more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, um ok, I guess I should have not followed you and made you talk to me, but I just couldn\u2019t,\u201d she shivered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay and be where\u2026\u201d she rocked in a breath. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be there, where\u2026.\u201d Why couldn\u2019t she say it?</p><p>\u201cWhere Harry had been, where you had been with him?\u201d He supplied and she felt tears slip down her cheeks. \u201cMe either. Can you stay until tomorrow, and I\u2019ll try to put on my big boy pants and get ready to talk to you. I actually had come home because I had some things to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them spoke about why that never happened. In fact, they just spent the day pretending that nothing was amiss, keeping distance and focusing on Zoe. It felt so much like her times with Colin that her skin was crawling.</p><p>Their behavior was reminiscent of her divorce, but you can\u2019t divorce your son. And lord knew that she had no interest in disowning him. She hoped he felt the same. Her optimism there was shaky, but its foundations built itself up every hour he let her hang around. He let her in last night because it was late and she had Zoe, but today she could safely leave at any time.</p><p>Ethan wanted to talk to her. Jo had no idea what she was gonna say.</p><p>So that night while he was at work, she rummaged a bottle of wine up and went into her trunk to find some supplies. Jo stared at the canvas until her bottle was nearly dry and found herself crying. The beat she put on the canvas was rolling itself into a big ball and coming at her, like her hopes and dreams had twisted into something painful Her woman was at the bottom of the painting trying to outrun what her creation had become.</p><p>She was still sitting at the canvas she\u2019d propped up over kitchen roll on her empty bottle. And her lady was just about out of room to run.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Ethan whisper shouted and she looked up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost three am. Go to bed.\u201d He touched her to help her up and wiped away her tears without comment. She let his mildewing eyes pass as well. But she couldn\u2019t help but hug him. He hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pissed with you.\u201d He bittered into her neck. \u201cBut I\u2019m pissed at me too, because had I ever been able to be honest with you, we may not be in this situation.\u201d He sounded like he was talking from the bottom of a well.</p><p>\u201cI think we both know who the liar is here!\u201d Her sentence sounded like a curse word. All at him. How the fuck was she missing him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, fuck I,\u201d he sat on the couch and looked around. \u201cZoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll cuddle her tonight. Think I need it.\u201d He exhaled, and looked at her with still humid eyes. \u201cI could kill him Mum. But, he was also keeping my secret, I think.\u201d</p><p>Jo shook her head at that. \u201cWhat secret is worth this? Such a big lie!\u201d She boggled.</p><p>Ethan gnashed his teeth and closed his eyes, looked down then said. \u201cI\u2019m gay Mum.\u201d</p><p>Well, she\u2019d surmised as much from the fight Harry and Ethan had had. Or that her son was some variation of not straight. The impact was soft. The revelation he feared so much didn\u2019t change how she loved him, and while she took in the shapes of face, she remembered the youthful round chubbiness of him as a toddler, and the lean pride of busy elementary Ethan, the awkward spots of puberty, and the squareness of beginning adulthood. He was her Ethan, whoever he loved.</p><p>She wanted to be upset he hadn\u2019t told her. But this was not about her at all. So she tried to focus on him, and put her hand on his knee. \u201cOk,\u201d she started with. \u201cI love you. However you are. However you\u2019ve been, with whoever.\u201d</p><p>Ethan just looked at her and folded himself into her lap. It was a feat, he was almost six feet tall. She wrapped her arms around him and felt him tense and then sob for just a minute while he began talking.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew that, that that would be how you would respond. I\u2019m so fucking livid that I couldn\u2019t get the words out. I think I\u2019ve ruined at least three relationships because I\u2019m ashamed of who I am.\u201d By the time he reached the end he\u2019d exhaled though, and some of the god awful tension he\u2019d held was sucked into the vent.</p><p>\u201cWhat relationships?\u201d She bit her lip, please don\u2019t mean us, she thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, definitely me and Harry. I want to fucking kill him.\u201d He balled his fists and sat up, his tears gone now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over for ages, because he was so pushy, always pushing me for more, and never satisfied.\u201d Yeah, she knew that about him. \u201cSo fucking insecure. But we were able to be friends, but I can\u2019t even look at him now. Think I\u2019d punch him in the face.\u201d</p><p>She mmmhmmm\u2019d encouragingly. She wanted to slap him herself. And then\u2026. would the longing ever fade. She stopped herself from slouching to ruin and refocused.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sean and me.\u201d He swallowed and Jo remembered the tall sweet boy she\u2019d met only a couple weeks ago. That made sense. \u201cHe\u2019s so. He\u2019s so mad at me. Just like Harry was. Won\u2019t talk to me. I just want him to talk to me.\u201d His sentences were clipped and quiet. \u201cI just miss him tal\u2026I just miss him.\u201d He looked up are her then.</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s your someone, then?\u201d Jo caught his eyes and smoothed his hair back.</p><p>Her son bit his lip and nodded. The honesty though, had loosened the lines around his eyes, and his temples were smooth now. Jo adopted the lightness.</p><p>\u201cGood on you. He\u2019s cute! Can I meet him tomorrow?\u201d What she was really asking was, am I allowed to? Are you too mad at me?</p><p>\u201cHe hates that I wouldn\u2019t meet his family last week.\u201d God, last week, Jo thought.. \u201cAnd that when I introduced him to you I didn\u2019t really introduce him to you. May be too little, too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he will get over it. He\u2019s hurt, nobody likes to feel like the person they love is ashamed of them.\u201d They shared a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Harry. Imagine that\u2019s well over now. Not that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He looked liked he\u2019d eaten a bitter lemon.</p><p>Jo suddenly felt her tears rush back. She was sorry. How cruel, to be so close to something great and find out its foundations were rotting. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026.don\u2019t even want to see him.\u201d It was all she could say about that. \u201cAnd the last relationship?\u201d There was only one dyad left. \u00a0Ethan was being so nice. But just a day ago, he\u2019d been rightfully livid and nearly kicked her off his doorstep.</p><p>\u201cI dunno Mum?\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m really mad at you, and you knew I\u2019d be upset about it, but you carried on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought, well, I, couldn\u2019t,\u201d She took his hand. \u201cNone of it sounds like more than dust in the wind now. I thought you\u2019d be mad and then accept it. You kept going on about how happy I looked.\u201d She pursed her mouth, can a lie still make you happy? \u201cI hoped you\u2019d be happy for us. But I didn\u2019t know!\u201d That came out harsh and bitter.</p><p>\u201cI know Mum. And if he wasn\u2019t what he was to me, I dunno, maybe you\u2019d be right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou alright?\u201d He looked at her face then.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re alright. If you can forgive me for lying and keeping secrets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was doing the same thing.\u201d Ethan conceded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be alright. And I want to meet Sean. You should try to work it out.\u201d Jo sighed, somebody should get their happy ending. \u00a0Sean seemed the real innocent here. He deserved it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, ok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo call him.\u201d Jo nudged him when he stood and he smiled and her heart stitched itself back together a little at the tippy top.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sleep. Jo lay in bed and felt like she was in an Iron Maiden, or wished she had been one. Had she been cold and contained sharp edges, maybe she wouldn\u2019t feel like her skin was covered in cuts. At least she wouldn\u2019t know what her skin was capable of feeling like, like it glowed and everywhere he touched you could see the light. The contrast was painful.</p><p>The worst part was that she wanted Harry. At night, on Ethan\u2019s couch, she wanted to wake up to his feet shuffling and his arms with their black etchings wrapped round her. The cycle went like this. She\u2019d hold still on the couch, close her eyes and flash to the scene in her bedroom just a day ago. The humiliation and confusion. Her need for comfort would well up and her Judas heart would call for Harry.</p><p>Harry who had a knack for texting or trying to ring her whenever a residue of sympathy clung to her. She\u2019d had to shut off her phone.</p><p>Then she would focus on her son\u2019s face and her own hurt. He\u2019d lied, this whole time. Could you love somebody you kept such a secret from? Then she would realize she\u2019d kept a secret just like it from Ethan. She had so many questions.</p><p>Then she would try to sleep, and it would begin all again.</p><p>The next day she knew she looked thin-skinned. Ethan had made her tea, though he was the injured party, and Sean, lovely Sean, had held her a little long and the strong hand up and down her back had made tears well up. </p><p>Ethan and Sean looked good together. And Sean looked over the moon to be the boyfriend and not the friend. Once Sean and Ethan were snuggled up in the pub booth and Zoe was playing and Jo was avoiding alcohol because she had a drive, she found herself in a familiar place.</p><p>Jo stood before the mirror and stared at the lone middle-aged woman looking back at her. Alone again, after months of partnership. Her picker was horribly broken. It was time to set aside her hopes for companionship, it never worked out. Also, time to set aside the woman Harry saw her as.</p><p>Jo liked her better.</p><p>Now, she was as much a facade as Harry\u2019s apparent love.</p><p>Why?</p><p>His motivations plagued her. Was it all a joke? Some sick interest in hurting Ethan, being Ethan? Did it have anything to do with her?</p><p>Did he love her at all? The version of her that was his?</p><p>By herself, all the questions she had piled up like logs on a river, but she\u2019d not ask them, she\u2019d have to live with the emotional dam. That part of her stayed upriver.</p><p>The drive home was horrible. Because Zoe slept in the back, she couldn\u2019t turn up the music loud enough to drown out the voices, the ones with all the questions. They were loud.</p><p>But the answers were on her doorstep, sat in the dark. And he looked like a daydream.</p><p>A beautiful nightmare.</p></p>",

The way that Ethan said Harry&rsquo;s name - the tone and hitch, the beg were all so familiar. Ethan was talking when she tuned her senses back into the room. Harry was still above her, he hadn&rsquo;t moved so much as constricted, but he&rsquo;d shrunk out of her.</p><p>&ldquo;You must have a thing for Smiths you fucking Judas.&rdquo; The quiet broken windowpane of Ethan&rsquo;s voice ripped into Jo&rsquo;s flesh and though she was still damp, it felt like the clamminess of a grave.</p><p>What the fuck did that mean? Judas?</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking my mum?&rdquo; Ethan&rsquo;s voice went up in volume that time. Harry closed in on himself on top of her, dead weight instead of shelter.</p><p>Jo pushed at him to get him to pull his body off her, to get some fresh air. She could barely breathe, the air was fetid.</p><p>He pulled back and just before she could catch her breath his murky green eyes caught hers inside the surround of his hair and he said, &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo; She realized then her cheek was wet and she wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was him or her.</p><p>Harry rolled to the side and quickly grabbed for the boxers she had removed with her feet a lifetime ago.</p><p>This was a new life.</p><p>Once he was covered a bit, Jo watched him put on something else when he took a huge breath and turned to her son, who stood seething with hands clenched in silhouetted. Harry was contrite, but stood straight and looked to where Ethan had come farther into the doorway. </p><p>Ethan&rsquo;s face broke Jo&rsquo;s heart. She could barely see anything with the light behind him and it was still all that she could see. Shattered. Jo covered herself up to her nose, but she could still smell her crime.</p><p>Harry spoke then inside the stifling air. &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not fucking your mum! I love her, she loves me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! Like you loved me?&rdquo; Ethan shouted in return.</p><p>What? Jo thought. What was he talking about?</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan! You do not get to rewrite history.&rdquo; Harry was yelling back, she&rsquo;d never heard his voice like that, not even after the awards banquet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fucking rewriting history, you sick fuck. Both of us?&rdquo; Ethan started towards Harry.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan!&rdquo; Jo uttered. He looked at her and she thought of the way his face would melt when his dad didn&rsquo;t show up before she gave up trying to facilitate a relationship all together.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that. We couldn&rsquo;t help it. We were around each other, all the time. She&rsquo;s&hellip;.&rdquo; he looked at Jo then. &ldquo;She, I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan scoffed. &ldquo;This some way to get back at me, because I didn&rsquo;t want people to call me a faggot. Wouldn&rsquo;t be with you, hold your bloody hand at college? Is this some sick way to get back at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about you at all!&rdquo; Harry stood mostly naked, sweating, maybe still from being inside of her, or from the increase in temperature in the room.</p><p>But Jo had chills.</p><p>&ldquo;It was always about me Harry, you were fucking obsessed with me.&rdquo; Ethan threw his hands up, he&rsquo;d come to the end of the bed and Jo could hear his face was red, though it was too dark to confirm.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, and you felt nothing for me, Ethan!&rdquo; Harry puffed his chest up. &ldquo;Never whispered how much you wished for me into my neck?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than I should have, you piece of shit. How could you? My fucking mum, she&rsquo;s all I have. You ruin fucking everything!&rdquo; Ethan&rsquo;s voice was loud, and fragile like a note held too long in the air. &ldquo;Ruined me, loving you.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh god! Jo&rsquo;s heart broke on her son&rsquo;s note. Loving you. She could totally see how loving Harry, or no longer loving him, could crack your voice. It was a peak into her near future she grieved.</p><p>Harry gnashed his teeth then. &ldquo;You never loved me, not enough. You liked the way I made you feel. But I was your fucking dirty little secret. Bit of experimentation on the side.&rdquo; He hit his chest with his palm. &ldquo;And I, I fucking followed you like a puppy and ate your scraps for years. Ages. Until I realized there were other people in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like my mum!&rdquo; Ethan screeched and Jo remembered Zoe was upstairs. She started praying she&rsquo;d sleep through or stay where she was.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not just your mum, Ethan. She&rsquo;s an entire person outside of you. A woman. She loves me more than you ever did! Makes plans with me and tells me so, and is willing to tell people. You&rsquo;d never own me, be with me out loud.&rdquo; She had agreed to all those things and the backbeat of pride Harry spoke with made her stomach roll.</p><p>Ethan rushed him angrily then. Harry stood up straight and faced him. Ready to catch or repay the coming blow. Jo thought she said stop.</p><p>Ethan&rsquo;s arms came up to grapple Harry rather than hit him. And Jo watched him deflate, the way he nuzzled into her when he told her about his mum. But when Ethan got his arms around him it changed. Was more of a hug than a blow, but no less sharp. Jo watched as Ethan struck another.</p><p>Instead of hitting him, Ethan hissed, &ldquo;Yeah but you&rsquo;re still a fucking secret, aren&rsquo;t you Harry? Never good enough to be more than a thing fucked in the dark.&rdquo;</p><p>Jo watched the glass of Harry&rsquo;s face crack, his shoulders hunched and he got his finger up into Ethan&rsquo;s face. Whatever he wanted to say, it didn&rsquo;t come out. &ldquo;Et-&rdquo; he gasped like the air was thin, Himalayan high.</p><p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s so willing to tell people? Because I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about it.&rdquo; The grin then, god, that Ethan reached for the hurt so quickly, like Jo did months ago and belittled Harry to make his point. &ldquo;Face it Harry, you are still a secret, a dirty one. My mum, like me, knows better than to tell people about being with you.&rdquo; The mocking tone in his voice hurt Jo, but the look on Harry&rsquo;s face was devastating.That&rsquo;s what really hurt, tore at her and made her stomach twist. That the sympathy for him remained through the shock.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true. She loves me, wants to have my baby,&rdquo; he shook his head back and forth.</p><p>&ldquo;You mad? She&rsquo;s too old for another child! She&rsquo;ll be 65 before it&rsquo;s at uni! And you&rsquo;re leaving the country. She doesn&rsquo;t need you. She&rsquo;s got me and Zoe, you&rsquo;re a bit of fun, Harry, like you always are. The big dick and the loving words, nobody turns those down, but never good enough to tell anybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were gonna tell you, have a dinner to tell my mum,&rdquo; his voice broke. &ldquo;I guess- I gue&mdash;&rdquo; he looked at Jo and she had no idea what was on her face, but he gnashed his teeth and broke the embrace with Ethan and came to her side of the bed. Jo was still buried under the covers. &ldquo;Baby?&rdquo; He reached for her.</p><p>She recoiled, a fired gun, spent bullet. Oh God, she&rsquo;d let him in. He had just been inside of her. And she&rsquo;d pushed away her son for him. And he was a liar. Had deceived her and used her and she didn&rsquo;t know why, or what it meant. Jo&rsquo;s stomach felt like it was full of serpents.</p><p>Harry saw it, the change. &ldquo;Jo?&rdquo; He gasped her name. &ldquo;Pleas&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out.&rdquo; It was the first words she&rsquo;d gotten out. They were corroded. &ldquo;Get the fuck outta my house Harry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Jo listen&mdash;-&rdquo;</p><p>She cut him off. &ldquo;Fuck you. What the fuck can you possibly say? You fucked my son and then came after me? What the fuck is wrong with you&mdash;-&rdquo; she started pulling at her skin like it hurt.</p><p>She looked up at Ethan then, and his tears had dried. &ldquo;Ethan,&rdquo; she tried to go to him, but remembered her nakedness, the dried sweat and tears, and the cum cooling between her legs. She stayed on the bed and started to cry.</p><p>Ethan just looked at her, his face ragged like sandpaper had rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>Jo had thought about the reasons, and in another setting they may have been worth saying, carried more than the weight of a feather on the scales: I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I love him so much. I&rsquo;ve never felt better in my skin than with him. No one ever treated me so well, loved me like that. I like me better when I&rsquo;m with him. We were undeniable. We&rsquo;re art, we are a masterpiece.</p><p>Those all remained true, but were worthless now. Because, if it was just the betrayal of sleeping with Ethan&rsquo;s mate, that would hurt, but she had believed they could move past that. But as her mind processed the last five minutes, dots connected in her mind in a haphazard line.</p><p>She and Harry had been trying to build a home on a grave.</p><p>Ethan and Harry, all those times they took forever to come down, and the tickle spots, and Harry&rsquo;s boyfriend that wouldn&rsquo;t claim him? It was her son, they were a &lsquo;them&rsquo;. Was their whole love affair a lie? Or just based on one? She couldn&rsquo;t even get her thoughts together. A game? A joke? Her son&rsquo;s lover, she retched, feeling bile in her mouth.</p><p>She wrapped the sheet around her and ran for the bathroom, emptying the quick sandwich she had eaten earlier into the toilet. She heard a ruckus over her shoulder, and looked back at the slim doorway to Ethan pushing Harry away from her.</p><p>&ldquo;She told you to fucking leave.&rdquo; Ethan came in and pulled her hair into a low ponytail, still tender even in anger.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo!!&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice broke and it made her eyes well over again in tandem with his.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy!&rdquo; Sounded from upstairs and insult multiplied injury.</p><p>Jo pulled herself up and wanted to say something to her son. He&rsquo;d moved back from her as soon as she flushed the toilet and rose. Harry stood back from the doorway and she made herself small to go around him, so none of her would touch a bit of his skin, and closed her closet door.</p><p>She could hear noise and low tense voices while she threw on a t-shirt, careful it was hers, and sweats. When she came out, Ethan was near the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan, don&rsquo;t leave, please!&rdquo; She got out, and went towards him. Zoe&rsquo;s cries started again, louder than an alarm, and Jo looked up and down and felt torn in two.</p><p>Three if you counted the quiet sobs coming behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, get Zoe Mum, she wants you near her.&rdquo; The unspoken subtext was clear. The door closed and Jo&rsquo;s knees went weak. She folded down and would have stayed there had Harry not tried to put his hands on her. They may as well have been covered in leper&rsquo;s rags for the revulsion it caused.</p><p>The hard floorboards under her knees were smoother under her feet when she flinched away and made a move for the stairs. Running up. Her phone, she hated how far down she had to scroll down to get to Ethan&rsquo;s number in her recently called list and how large the number could be when he lived under her roof.</p><p>Her trip on the landing may have been due to her face in the screen, or the tears in her eyes, or the fact that she thought her kneecaps being broken would hurt less.</p><p>&ldquo;Ethan! Please! I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; That was the first call, she assumed of many. And he shady buttoned her. Zoe was at the top of the stairs, holding the blankey she loved and used to take everywhere with white knuckles and teary eyes. She would normally have no problems coming down the stairs and getting right in the middle of the fray. Today, Zoe stood at the top step like there was a force field holding her back.</p><p>&ldquo;Mummy!&rdquo; She melted and Jo picked her up and the twin burying of their noses in the others neck was relief.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo!&rdquo; She heard behind her and the little comfort Zoe had brought slacked off her skin like water out of a gutter shoot.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t look at him. &ldquo;Get out Harry.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t yell, her voice was raw with the last twenty minutes though most of her screaming had been internal.</p><p>&ldquo;Jo, baby!&rdquo; She tensed then and did look at him and whatever was on her face, he withdrew into his skin like a chick not quite ready to leave the egg. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; It was a hiccup, wet and mucusy. &ldquo;Please let me explain.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned so Zoe couldn&rsquo;t see him. &ldquo;Get out. Don&rsquo;t come back. If you&rsquo;re not gone by the time I get downstairs, I&rsquo;m calling the police.&rdquo; Her voice was flat, like a dry lake bed.</p><p>Harry just looked at her, he didn&rsquo;t even have to blink for the tears to run out. When he finally did close his eyes, it was in defeat. His posture was never good, but he wasn&rsquo;t a recalcitrant knight now, but one who&rsquo;d lost the holy land.</p><p>Jo heard the door shut, and it was the first pang of heartbreak she&rsquo;d felt over the disgust. </p><p>No, she wasn&rsquo;t gonna be sad about him. Miss him. He was a liar. He&rsquo;d lied to her for ages, maybe by omission, but a relationship, a sexual one, with her son, was a life-changing, relationship precluding situation.</p><p>He was a betrayer. Ethan and her. Ethan seemed so hurt by Harry being with her. And it was Harry who had hurt him. Jo could cut all ties to Harry, they could remove him from their life, she and Ethan and Zoe, the Brutus who had stabbed them in the back at the same time, same knife.</p><p>But she had to get to her son. Ethan had to listen. To forgive her. The rational side of her, the one she had not been listening to for nearly six months told her to calm down and give him time.</p><p>The mum, who&rsquo;d seen the cracks and fissures of water snake down his face, couldn&rsquo;t. This wasn&rsquo;t like the time she wasn&rsquo;t able to come to his footie awards because of the department meeting and the traffic an accident caused, blocking the only way home. Ethan had been so sad, he&rsquo;d been sad with Anne and Harry. God, she couldn&rsquo;t again.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why this was so different. Jo had done her best to get to him that time, to be in the audience, and he&rsquo;d not been alone. He was alone this time.</p><p>Because she had taken something from him, his support system, her and his best mate, or lover, or&hellip;?</p><p>By the time she was in the truck she was crying again. What kind of mother was she?</p><p>The kind that dragged her three year old out into the dark to chase down the one she&rsquo;d betrayed. That knife was in her hand too.</p><p>Zoe nodded off quickly, it was dark and still and a new day, but no one had told the sun that as it still sat below the horizon and had yet to rear its golden head. She hoped she beat the dawn, that she didn&rsquo;t have to watch the light break across the sky. It would be tainted, maybe forever now. &ldquo;Fuck you Styles.&rdquo;</p><p>Zoe had tear tracks dried on her face and her blankey clutched tightly when she got to Ethan&rsquo;s student apartment. But she stayed asleep, cuddled into her mother&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>Because she didn&rsquo;t know. She had no idea what Jo had done, and only saw her as a source of comfort and rest. Zoe didn&rsquo;t know what last night was about and Jo hoped she never did. She hoped she was light in the eyes of one of her children for a little longer at least.</p><p>She knocked for a while. The curtain near the door rustled and her own eyes, she assumed hers were just as red, looked out at her. They tightened at the edges. The light was changing and Jo wanted to get inside as soon as she could, like if the weak sunshine touched her, it would give her a sickness.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only letting you in because you have her. Figure out the couch bed, I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo; Ethan sounded much colder than even when she hadn&rsquo;t let him go to the team trips when he was 15 years old. He&rsquo;d not been showing great judgement, which was ironic currently, and she didn&rsquo;t think Germany without her was a great idea. He&rsquo;d been awful to her for the lead up, duration, and aftermath of the trip.</p><p>This time she deserved it. She bit her lip to keep all her words from spilling out as it looked like he was entirely unready for her to approach the subject, and time to cool the anger and hurt was a good thing. But she had to say something.</p><p>She lay Zoe on the couch and turned towards the kitchen where he was grabbing the cuppa he must have made when he got in. He couldn&rsquo;t have beat her by much.</p><p>She got slightly closer and Ethan held up a hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t now Mum.&rdquo; His voice broke.</p><p>She nodded and bit her lip.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning. Well, more morning.&rdquo; He tried to fake a smile for her and straightened his shoulders to walk passed her. She almost grabbed him. To hold him to her. But she let him go. But as he walked through his bed room door she realized he had left her a cup brewing as well. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you, Ethan.&rdquo; It was all she could get out.</p><p>He looked back, anguished. &ldquo;I love you, Mum.&rdquo; He coughed and closed the door. </p><p>Though it might have been a comfort, Jo found herself crying over it, and that he poured her tea. He was the best boy. She did not deserve him. It was bitter, he&rsquo;d put no sugar in, or honey, but his words and the gesture were sweet enough that she swallowed the whole cup in two gulps.</p><p>She located a shower, because she was certain she wouldn&rsquo;t sleep until she had rinsed her sins away, and laid down curled around Zoe with her back off the edge of the couch.</p><p>Jo knew her rest would be fitful and rough at best, nightmare filled at worst. She tried though, so she could organize her case, though she knew she was guilty, into something sympathetic at the very least the next day. Maybe she&rsquo;d get manslaughter rather than emotional murder. She had some time to serve though.</p><p>Zoe stirred when the day was late. It was hard to tell because it was cloudy and Jo was thankful. The sun had no place in her life today. The grey was what she could handle.</p><p>Ethan appeared at eleven and Jo was laying breakfast out for him and Zoe.</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, I made pancakes.&rdquo; Not waffles. &ldquo;Do you have work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. And not 'til three.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk? Or after?&rdquo; She begged.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but.&rdquo; He went passed her and let their shoulders brush and she could breathe again. &ldquo;Mum&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I can today. I need a bit more time?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, um ok, I guess I should have not followed you and made you talk to me, but I just couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she shivered. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay and be where&hellip;&rdquo; she rocked in a breath. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be there, where&hellip;.&rdquo; Why couldn&rsquo;t she say it?</p><p>&ldquo;Where Harry had been, where you had been with him?&rdquo; He supplied and she felt tears slip down her cheeks. &ldquo;Me either. Can you stay until tomorrow, and I&rsquo;ll try to put on my big boy pants and get ready to talk to you. I actually had come home because I had some things to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of them spoke about why that never happened. In fact, they just spent the day pretending that nothing was amiss, keeping distance and focusing on Zoe. It felt so much like her times with Colin that her skin was crawling.</p><p>Their behavior was reminiscent of her divorce, but you can&rsquo;t divorce your son. And lord knew that she had no interest in disowning him. She hoped he felt the same. Her optimism there was shaky, but its foundations built itself up every hour he let her hang around. He let her in last night because it was late and she had Zoe, but today she could safely leave at any time.</p><p>Ethan wanted to talk to her. Jo had no idea what she was gonna say.</p><p>So that night while he was at work, she rummaged a bottle of wine up and went into her trunk to find some supplies. Jo stared at the canvas until her bottle was nearly dry and found herself crying. The beat she put on the canvas was rolling itself into a big ball and coming at her, like her hopes and dreams had twisted into something painful Her woman was at the bottom of the painting trying to outrun what her creation had become.</p><p>She was still sitting at the canvas she&rsquo;d propped up over kitchen roll on her empty bottle. And her lady was just about out of room to run.</p><p>&ldquo;Mum!&rdquo; Ethan whisper shouted and she looked up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost three am. Go to bed.&rdquo; He touched her to help her up and wiped away her tears without comment. She let his mildewing eyes pass as well. But she couldn&rsquo;t help but hug him. He hugged her back.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pissed with you.&rdquo; He bittered into her neck. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m pissed at me too, because had I ever been able to be honest with you, we may not be in this situation.&rdquo; He sounded like he was talking from the bottom of a well.</p><p>&ldquo;I think we both know who the liar is here!&rdquo; Her sentence sounded like a curse word. All at him. How the fuck was she missing him?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m, fuck I,&rdquo; he sat on the couch and looked around. &ldquo;Zoe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in your bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll cuddle her tonight. Think I need it.&rdquo; He exhaled, and looked at her with still humid eyes. &ldquo;I could kill him Mum. But, he was also keeping my secret, I think.&rdquo;</p><p>Jo shook her head at that. &ldquo;What secret is worth this? Such a big lie!&rdquo; She boggled.</p><p>Ethan gnashed his teeth and closed his eyes, looked down then said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay Mum.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, she&rsquo;d surmised as much from the fight Harry and Ethan had had. Or that her son was some variation of not straight. The impact was soft. The revelation he feared so much didn&rsquo;t change how she loved him, and while she took in the shapes of face, she remembered the youthful round chubbiness of him as a toddler, and the lean pride of busy elementary Ethan, the awkward spots of puberty, and the squareness of beginning adulthood. He was her Ethan, whoever he loved.</p><p>She wanted to be upset he hadn&rsquo;t told her. But this was not about her at all. So she tried to focus on him, and put her hand on his knee. &ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; she started with. &ldquo;I love you. However you are. However you&rsquo;ve been, with whoever.&rdquo;</p><p>Ethan just looked at her and folded himself into her lap. It was a feat, he was almost six feet tall. She wrapped her arms around him and felt him tense and then sob for just a minute while he began talking.</p><p>&ldquo;And I knew that, that that would be how you would respond. I&rsquo;m so fucking livid that I couldn&rsquo;t get the words out. I think I&rsquo;ve ruined at least three relationships because I&rsquo;m ashamed of who I am.&rdquo; By the time he reached the end he&rsquo;d exhaled though, and some of the god awful tension he&rsquo;d held was sucked into the vent.</p><p>&ldquo;What relationships?&rdquo; She bit her lip, please don&rsquo;t mean us, she thought.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, definitely me and Harry. I want to fucking kill him.&rdquo; He balled his fists and sat up, his tears gone now. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been over for ages, because he was so pushy, always pushing me for more, and never satisfied.&rdquo; Yeah, she knew that about him. &ldquo;So fucking insecure. But we were able to be friends, but I can&rsquo;t even look at him now. Think I&rsquo;d punch him in the face.&rdquo;</p><p>She mmmhmmm&rsquo;d encouragingly. She wanted to slap him herself. And then&hellip;. would the longing ever fade. She stopped herself from slouching to ruin and refocused.</p><p>&ldquo;And Sean and me.&rdquo; He swallowed and Jo remembered the tall sweet boy she&rsquo;d met only a couple weeks ago. That made sense. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so. He&rsquo;s so mad at me. Just like Harry was. Won&rsquo;t talk to me. I just want him to talk to me.&rdquo; His sentences were clipped and quiet. &ldquo;I just miss him tal&hellip;I just miss him.&rdquo; He looked up are her then.</p><p>&ldquo;Sean&rsquo;s your someone, then?&rdquo; Jo caught his eyes and smoothed his hair back.</p><p>Her son bit his lip and nodded. The honesty though, had loosened the lines around his eyes, and his temples were smooth now. Jo adopted the lightness.</p><p>&ldquo;Good on you. He&rsquo;s cute! Can I meet him tomorrow?&rdquo; What she was really asking was, am I allowed to? Are you too mad at me?</p><p>&ldquo;He hates that I wouldn&rsquo;t meet his family last week.&rdquo; God, last week, Jo thought.. &ldquo;And that when I introduced him to you I didn&rsquo;t really introduce him to you. May be too little, too late now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think he will get over it. He&rsquo;s hurt, nobody likes to feel like the person they love is ashamed of them.&rdquo; They shared a sympathetic look.</p><p>&ldquo;And you and Harry. Imagine that&rsquo;s well over now. Not that I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; He looked liked he&rsquo;d eaten a bitter lemon.</p><p>Jo suddenly felt her tears rush back. She was sorry. How cruel, to be so close to something great and find out its foundations were rotting. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;.don&rsquo;t even want to see him.&rdquo; It was all she could say about that. &ldquo;And the last relationship?&rdquo; There was only one dyad left. &nbsp;Ethan was being so nice. But just a day ago, he&rsquo;d been rightfully livid and nearly kicked her off his doorstep.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno Mum?&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really mad at you, and you knew I&rsquo;d be upset about it, but you carried on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought, well, I, couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; She took his hand. &ldquo;None of it sounds like more than dust in the wind now. I thought you&rsquo;d be mad and then accept it. You kept going on about how happy I looked.&rdquo; She pursed her mouth, can a lie still make you happy? &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d be happy for us. But I didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; That came out harsh and bitter.</p><p>&ldquo;I know Mum. And if he wasn&rsquo;t what he was to me, I dunno, maybe you&rsquo;d be right.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; He looked at her face then.</p><p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re alright. If you can forgive me for lying and keeping secrets&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I was doing the same thing.&rdquo; Ethan conceded.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be alright. And I want to meet Sean. You should try to work it out.&rdquo; Jo sighed, somebody should get their happy ending. &nbsp;Sean seemed the real innocent here. He deserved it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, ok.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go call him.&rdquo; Jo nudged him when he stood and he smiled and her heart stitched itself back together a little at the tippy top.</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t sleep. Jo lay in bed and felt like she was in an Iron Maiden, or wished she had been one. Had she been cold and contained sharp edges, maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t feel like her skin was covered in cuts. At least she wouldn&rsquo;t know what her skin was capable of feeling like, like it glowed and everywhere he touched you could see the light. The contrast was painful.</p><p>The worst part was that she wanted Harry. At night, on Ethan&rsquo;s couch, she wanted to wake up to his feet shuffling and his arms with their black etchings wrapped round her. The cycle went like this. She&rsquo;d hold still on the couch, close her eyes and flash to the scene in her bedroom just a day ago. The humiliation and confusion. Her need for comfort would well up and her Judas heart would call for Harry.</p><p>Harry who had a knack for texting or trying to ring her whenever a residue of sympathy clung to her. She&rsquo;d had to shut off her phone.</p><p>Then she would focus on her son&rsquo;s face and her own hurt. He&rsquo;d lied, this whole time. Could you love somebody you kept such a secret from? Then she would realize she&rsquo;d kept a secret just like it from Ethan. She had so many questions.</p><p>Then she would try to sleep, and it would begin all again.</p><p>The next day she knew she looked thin-skinned. Ethan had made her tea, though he was the injured party, and Sean, lovely Sean, had held her a little long and the strong hand up and down her back had made tears well up. </p><p>Ethan and Sean looked good together. And Sean looked over the moon to be the boyfriend and not the friend. Once Sean and Ethan were snuggled up in the pub booth and Zoe was playing and Jo was avoiding alcohol because she had a drive, she found herself in a familiar place.</p><p>Jo stood before the mirror and stared at the lone middle-aged woman looking back at her. Alone again, after months of partnership. Her picker was horribly broken. It was time to set aside her hopes for companionship, it never worked out. Also, time to set aside the woman Harry saw her as.</p><p>Jo liked her better.</p><p>Now, she was as much a facade as Harry&rsquo;s apparent love.</p><p>Why?</p><p>His motivations plagued her. Was it all a joke? Some sick interest in hurting Ethan, being Ethan? Did it have anything to do with her?</p><p>Did he love her at all? The version of her that was his?</p><p>By herself, all the questions she had piled up like logs on a river, but she&rsquo;d not ask them, she&rsquo;d have to live with the emotional dam. That part of her stayed upriver.</p><p>The drive home was horrible. Because Zoe slept in the back, she couldn&rsquo;t turn up the music loud enough to drown out the voices, the ones with all the questions. They were loud.</p><p>But the answers were on her doorstep, sat in the dark. And he looked like a daydream.</p><p>A beautiful nightmare.</p></p>",

The way that Ethan said Harry&rsquo;s name - the tone and hitch, the beg were all so familiar. Ethan was talking when she tuned her senses back into the room. Harry was still above her, he hadn&rsquo;t moved so much as constricted, but he&rsquo;d shrunk out of her.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You must have a thing for Smiths you fucking Judas.&rdquo; The quiet broken windowpane of Ethan&rsquo;s voice ripped into Jo&rsquo;s flesh and though she was still damp, it felt like the clamminess of a grave.</p>\n<p>What the fuck did that mean? Judas?</p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>I agree with you fully. Honestly shit like this just reinforces gender roles. Even if he is trans it is impolite to speculate about this shit let him come out on his own terms (not saying he is trans but if he was) People need to stop pretending that\u00a0celebrities\u00a0are characters in a TV Show or some shit and remember that they are real human people and deserve that respect. Being pissy about this seems very reasonable and honestly, I am too now that I know about it</p>",
