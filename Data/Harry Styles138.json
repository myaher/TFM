You internally sighed at his complete failure at subtlety but said nothing, not wanting to intrude on the music he so often kept secret from you. </p><p>You felt the tug at your chest nonetheless. You were no fool. You knew why he was so private when it came to writing music. Despite the year you had spent sharing your life with Harry, you still failed to be his inspiration, his muse. </p><p>\u201cOkay lovie,\u201d he replied. </p><p><i>You, certainly, did not see.</i></p><p>\u201cWill I ever get to hear any of this music you stay holed up in here to write?\u201d You tried to adopt a teasing tone, silently cursing yourself for your lack of self control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hear it when it\u2019s done, just like everyone else,\u201d he gave you a half smile, still not quite withdrawn from his own head yet. </p><p>He tended to become completely immersed in his writing, and it would sometimes take hours for him to get out of his own head and back down to Earth. This was something you were used to. </p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not just everyone else am I?\u201d You failed to maintain the teasing tone this time around. </p><p>\u201cLove-\u201d Harry started, somewhat shocked, but you purposefully unlocked your phone and looked down at the time before he could even start. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going or I\u2019ll be late,\u201d the normalcy returned to your voice, and you took a few steps forward to press a kiss to the corner of Harry\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d you called as you walked out. </p><p>You heard not a word in return. </p><!-- more --><p><i>Not even Gemma saw what he really was.</i></p><p>\u201cSo how is Harold, who is far too busy writing love songs about you to attend this evening?\u201d Gemma asked over drinks at Anne\u2019s house some hours later.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly say he\u2019s writing songs about me,\u201d you gave what you hope sounded like a light-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Anne interjected, \u201cAll he ever seems to write about anymore is you. Every time I ask him what he\u2019s writing about when he\u2019s sitting on my couch with his journal and pen he says it\u2019s something for you,\u201d she laughed, not noticing the doubt etched in your brow.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be writing about you, you thought to yourself, what reason could he possibly have to hide his music from you if that was the case. He\u2019s one of the most talented singer-songwriters around today. It just didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d you spoke with uncertainty, \u201cHe\u2019s really secretive about all of his music. The whole year we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s been working so hard on writing this new album, but I haven\u2019t heard any of it. Not once. Surely I would have if he wasn\u2019t scared I\u2019d be angry that none of it is actually about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d the cogs in Gemma\u2019s head were turning. She knew for a fact that Harry wrote about you. All the damn time. So she knew you had to be wrong. But something there was clearly not quite right. He had never been precious about sharing his music before. </p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>It suddenly clicked in Gemma\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHe did share a lot of his music with his\u2026 ex-girlfriend,\u201d she hesitated, knowing this could be a sensitive topic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think she really received it well. She had no expertise and yet she was his biggest critic. She said she didn\u2019t want him releasing any of the songs that were,\u201d she hesitated once more, \u201cabout her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, shocked. He had never mentioned this girl before.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not to worry love,\u201d Anne piped up again, ever the one to shine positivity into a situation. \u201cThat\u2019s his past and he\u2019s going to leave all of that sensitivity behind soon enough I just know it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how I know it?\u201d She smiled, leaning in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile with her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re his forever. I just know it.\u201d</p><p><i>Nor his own mother, saw what he was.</i></p><p>Anne\u2019s words reverberated in your head the whole night. Through the drinks and the laughs and the whole ride home.</p><p>You were still so dazed by Anne\u2019s words that it took you a moment longer than it should have to process what was happening when you walked through the door of your shared home. </p><p>You could hear him before you see him, emptying his stomach into the toilet of the guest bathroom. \u201cBabe?\u201d you call from the doorway, alerting him of your presence before you nudge the door open with your foot to see your love hunched over the toilet.</p><p>It feels like a stab to the heart, seeing the boy you hold so so dear in so much pain and discomfort. All you want to do is take every bit of pain he\u2019s feeling away. Almost as quickly as your caring instincts kick in though, he stops himself vomiting long enough to say, \u201cDon\u2019t come in! I\u2019ll take care of myself I promise!\u201d </p><p>Your brow furrows in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d you say, stepping closer towards him.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d He cries out, hysterical from the illness overtaking his body. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d he repeats, tears slipping from his eyes as he continues vomiting into the toilet.</p><p>You kneel down beside him now and start rubbing his back as he finishes heaving into the toilet. \u201cBaby why am I not supposed to see? You\u2019ve taken care of me when I was sick like this, why can\u2019t I do the same?\u201d you ask, assuming he\u2019s embarrassed for you to see him as he is. </p><p>He wipes his mouth and slumps down against the wall, clearly finished for now. You lean forward and flush the toilet for him. He sits slumped in silence, gazing at a spot past you, purposely not looking at you. </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d you ask him, after having allowed him a moment\u2019s silence. </p><p>\u201cShe-\u201d he paused, nervous, \u201cshe didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t like what?\u201d you prompted.</p><p>\u201cMy- my ex, she didn\u2019t like it when I was sick. She told me not to go anywhere near her,\u201d his voice grew softer, \u201cshe told me I had to look after myself instead of making myself a problem for other people.\u201d He looked down at his hands, still refusing to look at you. </p><p><i>Now, now he was allowing you to see what no one but himself saw. He had been broken before. Absolutely smashed on the ground. Made to be self conscious, insecure, afraid. Made to call the mistreatment he was suffering love. And he escaped, yes. He put himself back together, yes. But he was still delicate. </i></p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d you frowned, reaching forward and sweeping a lock of his sweat matted hair back behind his ear. </p><p>You felt as though you could actually physically feel your heart aching for him, the urge to take all of the pain he was feeling away doubling. You also felt as though fire was pumping through your veins, your anger at the woman you had felt at the woman you heard about for the first time tonight tripling. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a problem. You\u2019re just sick. Everyone gets sick. And no one should be forced to take care of themselves when they\u2019re sick,\u201d you stroked his hair, inching closer towards him from your seat on the bathroom floor.</p><p>\u201cEspecially not when they have someone who loves them so dearly. Because when you love someone, you take care of them. Even when it isn\u2019t pretty,\u201d you half-joked, trying to get a smile out of him. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, voice raw from illness.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d you pressed a kiss to his sweaty forehead. \u201cNow let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, you both laid in bed, Harry shirtless and lying on his back, you lying on your side facing him, lightly tracing patterns over his stomach to put it at ease. You were trying not to crowd him, giving him room to try and make him feel better and also to keep his mind clear.</p><p>\u201cYou know your Mum and Gemma actually mentioned that girl at dinner tonight,\u201d you spoke softly. Harry just hummed in response, giving you permission to carry on. \u201cShe sounds like she was a real piece of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe clearly did a real number on me with her bullshit,\u201d he turned his head to look at you.</p><p>It was your turn to hum in response.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve been holding back a bit, in some aspects of our relationship. Or acting out of fear because of her but-\u201d he sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re not her. You\u2019re nothing like her. You make me feel safe. You make this house feel like a home.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment, Harry decided he was going to make a change. He had to erase his fears. He had to re-learn the instincts that he should have. And he knew, without either of you having to say a word, that you both knew that. He knew that you would be there with him every step of the way. </p><p>A few moments passed, with you still tracing patterns into his belly, trying to bring comfort with your delicate touch.</p><p>\u201cHey y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get better can I- can I play you some of the songs I wrote?\u201d He tried to remove some of the nerves from his voice, but she understood.</p><p>\u201cIf you feel comfortable playing them to me before everyone else, baby,\u201d you spoke carefully.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he spoke without hesitation now.</p><p>Because after all, you weren\u2019t everyone else. You were his forever.</p>",

You internally sighed at his complete failure at subtlety but said nothing, not wanting to intrude on the music he so often kept secret from you. </p><p>You felt the tug at your chest nonetheless. You were no fool. You knew why he was so private when it came to writing music. Despite the year you had spent sharing your life with Harry, you still failed to be his inspiration, his muse. </p><p>\u201cOkay lovie,\u201d he replied. </p><p><i>You, certainly, did not see.</i></p><p>\u201cWill I ever get to hear any of this music you stay holed up in here to write?\u201d You tried to adopt a teasing tone, silently cursing yourself for your lack of self control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hear it when it\u2019s done, just like everyone else,\u201d he gave you a half smile, still not quite withdrawn from his own head yet. </p><p>He tended to become completely immersed in his writing, and it would sometimes take hours for him to get out of his own head and back down to Earth. This was something you were used to. </p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not just everyone else am I?\u201d You failed to maintain the teasing tone this time around. </p><p>\u201cLove-\u201d Harry started, somewhat shocked, but you purposefully unlocked your phone and looked down at the time before he could even start. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going or I\u2019ll be late,\u201d the normalcy returned to your voice, and you took a few steps forward to press a kiss to the corner of Harry\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d you called as you walked out. </p><p>You heard not a word in return. </p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Not even Gemma saw what he really was.</i></p><p>\u201cSo how is Harold, who is far too busy writing love songs about you to attend this evening?\u201d Gemma asked over drinks at Anne\u2019s house some hours later.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly say he\u2019s writing songs about me,\u201d you gave what you hope sounded like a light-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Anne interjected, \u201cAll he ever seems to write about anymore is you. Every time I ask him what he\u2019s writing about when he\u2019s sitting on my couch with his journal and pen he says it\u2019s something for you,\u201d she laughed, not noticing the doubt etched in your brow.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be writing about you, you thought to yourself, what reason could he possibly have to hide his music from you if that was the case. He\u2019s one of the most talented singer-songwriters around today. It just didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d you spoke with uncertainty, \u201cHe\u2019s really secretive about all of his music. The whole year we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s been working so hard on writing this new album, but I haven\u2019t heard any of it. Not once. Surely I would have if he wasn\u2019t scared I\u2019d be angry that none of it is actually about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d the cogs in Gemma\u2019s head were turning. She knew for a fact that Harry wrote about you. All the damn time. So she knew you had to be wrong. But something there was clearly not quite right. He had never been precious about sharing his music before. </p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>It suddenly clicked in Gemma\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHe did share a lot of his music with his\u2026 ex-girlfriend,\u201d she hesitated, knowing this could be a sensitive topic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think she really received it well. She had no expertise and yet she was his biggest critic. She said she didn\u2019t want him releasing any of the songs that were,\u201d she hesitated once more, \u201cabout her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, shocked. He had never mentioned this girl before.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not to worry love,\u201d Anne piped up again, ever the one to shine positivity into a situation. \u201cThat\u2019s his past and he\u2019s going to leave all of that sensitivity behind soon enough I just know it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how I know it?\u201d She smiled, leaning in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile with her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re his forever. I just know it.\u201d</p><p><i>Nor his own mother, saw what he was.</i></p><p>Anne\u2019s words reverberated in your head the whole night. Through the drinks and the laughs and the whole ride home.</p><p>You were still so dazed by Anne\u2019s words that it took you a moment longer than it should have to process what was happening when you walked through the door of your shared home. </p><p>You could hear him before you see him, emptying his stomach into the toilet of the guest bathroom. \u201cBabe?\u201d you call from the doorway, alerting him of your presence before you nudge the door open with your foot to see your love hunched over the toilet.</p><p>It feels like a stab to the heart, seeing the boy you hold so so dear in so much pain and discomfort. All you want to do is take every bit of pain he\u2019s feeling away. Almost as quickly as your caring instincts kick in though, he stops himself vomiting long enough to say, \u201cDon\u2019t come in! I\u2019ll take care of myself I promise!\u201d </p><p>Your brow furrows in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d you say, stepping closer towards him.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d He cries out, hysterical from the illness overtaking his body. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d he repeats, tears slipping from his eyes as he continues vomiting into the toilet.</p><p>You kneel down beside him now and start rubbing his back as he finishes heaving into the toilet. \u201cBaby why am I not supposed to see? You\u2019ve taken care of me when I was sick like this, why can\u2019t I do the same?\u201d you ask, assuming he\u2019s embarrassed for you to see him as he is. </p><p>He wipes his mouth and slumps down against the wall, clearly finished for now. You lean forward and flush the toilet for him. He sits slumped in silence, gazing at a spot past you, purposely not looking at you. </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d you ask him, after having allowed him a moment\u2019s silence. </p><p>\u201cShe-\u201d he paused, nervous, \u201cshe didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t like what?\u201d you prompted.</p><p>\u201cMy- my ex, she didn\u2019t like it when I was sick. She told me not to go anywhere near her,\u201d his voice grew softer, \u201cshe told me I had to look after myself instead of making myself a problem for other people.\u201d He looked down at his hands, still refusing to look at you. </p><p><i>Now, now he was allowing you to see what no one but himself saw. He had been broken before. Absolutely smashed on the ground. Made to be self conscious, insecure, afraid. Made to call the mistreatment he was suffering love. And he escaped, yes. He put himself back together, yes. But he was still delicate. </i></p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d you frowned, reaching forward and sweeping a lock of his sweat matted hair back behind his ear. </p><p>You felt as though you could actually physically feel your heart aching for him, the urge to take all of the pain he was feeling away doubling. You also felt as though fire was pumping through your veins, your anger at the woman you had felt at the woman you heard about for the first time tonight tripling. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a problem. You\u2019re just sick. Everyone gets sick. And no one should be forced to take care of themselves when they\u2019re sick,\u201d you stroked his hair, inching closer towards him from your seat on the bathroom floor.</p><p>\u201cEspecially not when they have someone who loves them so dearly. Because when you love someone, you take care of them. Even when it isn\u2019t pretty,\u201d you half-joked, trying to get a smile out of him. </p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, voice raw from illness.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d you pressed a kiss to his sweaty forehead. \u201cNow let\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, you both laid in bed, Harry shirtless and lying on his back, you lying on your side facing him, lightly tracing patterns over his stomach to put it at ease. You were trying not to crowd him, giving him room to try and make him feel better and also to keep his mind clear.</p><p>\u201cYou know your Mum and Gemma actually mentioned that girl at dinner tonight,\u201d you spoke softly. Harry just hummed in response, giving you permission to carry on. \u201cShe sounds like she was a real piece of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe clearly did a real number on me with her bullshit,\u201d he turned his head to look at you.</p><p>It was your turn to hum in response.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve been holding back a bit, in some aspects of our relationship. Or acting out of fear because of her but-\u201d he sighed, \u201cyou\u2019re not her. You\u2019re nothing like her. You make me feel safe. You make this house feel like a home.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment, Harry decided he was going to make a change. He had to erase his fears. He had to re-learn the instincts that he should have. And he knew, without either of you having to say a word, that you both knew that. He knew that you would be there with him every step of the way. </p><p>A few moments passed, with you still tracing patterns into his belly, trying to bring comfort with your delicate touch.</p><p>\u201cHey y/n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get better can I- can I play you some of the songs I wrote?\u201d He tried to remove some of the nerves from his voice, but she understood.</p><p>\u201cIf you feel comfortable playing them to me before everyone else, baby,\u201d you spoke carefully.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he spoke without hesitation now.</p><p>Because after all, you weren\u2019t everyone else. You were his forever.</p>",

This was something you were used to. </p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not just everyone else am I?\u201d You failed to maintain the teasing tone this time around. </p><p>\u201cLove-\u201d Harry started, somewhat shocked, but you purposefully unlocked your phone and looked down at the time before he could even start. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going or I\u2019ll be late,\u201d the normalcy returned to your voice, and you took a few steps forward to press a kiss to the corner of Harry\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d </p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d you called as you walked out. </p><p>You heard not a word in return. </p>[[MORE]]<p><i>Not even Gemma saw what he really was.</i></p><p>\u201cSo how is Harold, who is far too busy writing love songs about you to attend this evening?\u201d Gemma asked over drinks at Anne\u2019s house some hours later.</p><p>\u201cI would hardly say he\u2019s writing songs about me,\u201d you gave what you hope sounded like a light-hearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking?\u201d Anne interjected, \u201cAll he ever seems to write about anymore is you. Every time I ask him what he\u2019s writing about when he\u2019s sitting on my couch with his journal and pen he says it\u2019s something for you,\u201d she laughed, not noticing the doubt etched in your brow.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be writing about you, you thought to yourself, what reason could he possibly have to hide his music from you if that was the case. He\u2019s one of the most talented singer-songwriters around today. It just didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d you spoke with uncertainty, \u201cHe\u2019s really secretive about all of his music. The whole year we\u2019ve been together he\u2019s been working so hard on writing this new album, but I haven\u2019t heard any of it. Not once. Surely I would have if he wasn\u2019t scared I\u2019d be angry that none of it is actually about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d the cogs in Gemma\u2019s head were turning. She knew for a fact that Harry wrote about you. All the damn time. So she knew you had to be wrong. But something there was clearly not quite right. He had never been precious about sharing his music before. </p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>It suddenly clicked in Gemma\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHe did share a lot of his music with his\u2026 ex-girlfriend,\u201d she hesitated, knowing this could be a sensitive topic, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think she really received it well. She had no expertise and yet she was his biggest critic. She said she didn\u2019t want him releasing any of the songs that were,\u201d she hesitated once more, \u201cabout her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d you said, shocked. He had never mentioned this girl before.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not to worry love,\u201d Anne piped up again, ever the one to shine positivity into a situation. \u201cThat\u2019s his past and he\u2019s going to leave all of that sensitivity behind soon enough I just know it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how I know it?\u201d She smiled, leaning in closer to you.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but smile with her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re his forever. I just know it.\u201d</p><p><i>Nor his own mother, saw what he was.</i></p><p>Anne\u2019s words reverberated in your head the whole night. Through the drinks and the laughs and the whole ride home.</p><p>You were still so dazed by Anne\u2019s words that it took you a moment longer than it should have to process what was happening when you walked through the door of your shared home. </p><p>You could hear him before you see him, emptying his stomach into the toilet of the guest bathroom. \u201cBabe?\u201d you call from the doorway, alerting him of your presence before you nudge the door open with your foot to see your love hunched over the toilet.</p><p>It feels like a stab to the heart, seeing the boy you hold so so dear in so much pain and discomfort. All you want to do is take every bit of pain he\u2019s feeling away. Almost as quickly as your caring instincts kick in though, he stops himself vomiting long enough to say, \u201cDon\u2019t come in! I\u2019ll take care of myself I promise!\u201d </p><p>Your brow furrows in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d you say, stepping closer towards him.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d He cries out, hysterical from the illness overtaking his body. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see!\u201d he repeats, tears slipping from his eyes as he continues vomiting into the toilet.</p><p>You kneel down beside him now and start rubbing his back as he finishes heaving into the toilet. \u201cBaby why am I not supposed to see? You\u2019ve taken care of me when I was sick like this, why can\u2019t I do the same?\u201d you ask, assuming he\u2019s embarrassed for you to see him as he is. </p><p>He wipes his mouth and slumps down against the wall, clearly finished for now. You lean forward and flush the toilet for him. He sits slumped in silence, gazing at a spot past you, purposely not looking at you. </p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d you ask him, after having allowed him a moment\u2019s silence. </p><p>\u201cShe-\u201d he paused, nervous, \u201cshe didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t like what?\u201d you prompted.</p><p>\u201cMy- my ex, she didn\u2019t like it when I was sick. She told me not to go anywhere near her,\u201d his voice grew softer, \u201cshe told me I had to look after myself instead of making myself a problem for other people.\u201d He looked down at his hands, still refusing to look at you. </p><p><i>Now, now he was allowing you to see what no one but himself saw. He had been broken before. Absolutely smashed on the ground. Made to be self conscious, insecure, afraid. Made to call the mistreatment he was suffering love. And he escaped, yes. He put himself back together, yes. But he was still delicate. </i></p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d you frowned, reaching forward and sweeping a lock of his sweat matted hair back behind his ear. </p><p>You felt as though you could actually physically feel your heart aching for him, the urge to take all of the pain he was feeling away doubling. You also felt as though fire was pumping through your veins, your anger at the woman you had felt at the woman you heard about for the first time tonight tripling. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a problem. You\u2019re just sick. Everyone gets sick. And no one should be forced to take care of themselves when they\u2019re sick,\u201d you stroked his hair, inching closer towards him from your seat on the bathroom floor.</p><p>\u201cEspecially not when they have someone who loves them so dearly. Because when you love someone, you take care of them.

You internally sighed at his complete failure at subtlety but said nothing, not wanting to intrude on the music he so often kept secret from you. </p><p>You felt the tug at your chest nonetheless.

This was something you were used to. </p><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not just everyone else am I?&rdquo; You failed to maintain the teasing tone this time around. </p><p>&ldquo;Love-&rdquo; Harry started, somewhat shocked, but you purposefully unlocked your phone and looked down at the time before he could even start. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get going or I&rsquo;ll be late,&rdquo; the normalcy returned to your voice, and you took a few steps forward to press a kiss to the corner of Harry&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a few hours.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; you called as you walked out. </p><p>You heard not a word in return. </p><p><i>Not even Gemma saw what he really was.</i></p><p>&ldquo;So how is Harold, who is far too busy writing love songs about you to attend this evening?&rdquo; Gemma asked over drinks at Anne&rsquo;s house some hours later.</p><p>&ldquo;I would hardly say he&rsquo;s writing songs about me,&rdquo; you gave what you hope sounded like a light-hearted laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; Anne interjected, &ldquo;All he ever seems to write about anymore is you. Every time I ask him what he&rsquo;s writing about when he&rsquo;s sitting on my couch with his journal and pen he says it&rsquo;s something for you,&rdquo; she laughed, not noticing the doubt etched in your brow.</p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t be writing about you, you thought to yourself, what reason could he possibly have to hide his music from you if that was the case. He&rsquo;s one of the most talented singer-songwriters around today. It just didn&rsquo;t add up.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; you spoke with uncertainty, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really secretive about all of his music. The whole year we&rsquo;ve been together he&rsquo;s been working so hard on writing this new album, but I haven&rsquo;t heard any of it. Not once. Surely I would have if he wasn&rsquo;t scared I&rsquo;d be angry that none of it is actually about me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; the cogs in Gemma&rsquo;s head were turning. She knew for a fact that Harry wrote about you. All the damn time. So she knew you had to be wrong. But something there was clearly not quite right. He had never been precious about sharing his music before. </p><p><i>Oh.</i></p><p>It suddenly clicked in Gemma&rsquo;s head.</p><p>&ldquo;He did share a lot of his music with his&hellip; ex-girlfriend,&rdquo; she hesitated, knowing this could be a sensitive topic, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think she really received it well. She had no expertise and yet she was his biggest critic. She said she didn&rsquo;t want him releasing any of the songs that were,&rdquo; she hesitated once more, &ldquo;about her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; you said, shocked. He had never mentioned this girl before.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not to worry love,&rdquo; Anne piped up again, ever the one to shine positivity into a situation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his past and he&rsquo;s going to leave all of that sensitivity behind soon enough I just know it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how I know it?&rdquo; She smiled, leaning in closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile with her.</p><p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re his forever. I just know it.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Nor his own mother, saw what he was.</i></p><p>Anne&rsquo;s words reverberated in your head the whole night. Through the drinks and the laughs and the whole ride home.</p><p>You were still so dazed by Anne&rsquo;s words that it took you a moment longer than it should have to process what was happening when you walked through the door of your shared home. </p><p>You could hear him before you see him, emptying his stomach into the toilet of the guest bathroom. &ldquo;Babe?&rdquo; you call from the doorway, alerting him of your presence before you nudge the door open with your foot to see your love hunched over the toilet.</p><p>It feels like a stab to the heart, seeing the boy you hold so so dear in so much pain and discomfort. All you want to do is take every bit of pain he&rsquo;s feeling away. Almost as quickly as your caring instincts kick in though, he stops himself vomiting long enough to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in! I&rsquo;ll take care of myself I promise!&rdquo; </p><p>Your brow furrows in confusion. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; you say, stepping closer towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t supposed to see!&rdquo; He cries out, hysterical from the illness overtaking his body. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t supposed to see!&rdquo; he repeats, tears slipping from his eyes as he continues vomiting into the toilet.</p><p>You kneel down beside him now and start rubbing his back as he finishes heaving into the toilet. &ldquo;Baby why am I not supposed to see? You&rsquo;ve taken care of me when I was sick like this, why can&rsquo;t I do the same?&rdquo; you ask, assuming he&rsquo;s embarrassed for you to see him as he is. </p><p>He wipes his mouth and slumps down against the wall, clearly finished for now. You lean forward and flush the toilet for him. He sits slumped in silence, gazing at a spot past you, purposely not looking at you. </p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; you ask him, after having allowed him a moment&rsquo;s silence. </p><p>&ldquo;She-&rdquo; he paused, nervous, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who didn&rsquo;t like what?&rdquo; you prompted.</p><p>&ldquo;My- my ex, she didn&rsquo;t like it when I was sick. She told me not to go anywhere near her,&rdquo; his voice grew softer, &ldquo;she told me I had to look after myself instead of making myself a problem for other people.&rdquo; He looked down at his hands, still refusing to look at you. </p><p><i>Now, now he was allowing you to see what no one but himself saw. He had been broken before. Absolutely smashed on the ground. Made to be self conscious, insecure, afraid. Made to call the mistreatment he was suffering love. And he escaped, yes. He put himself back together, yes. But he was still delicate. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Oh baby,&rdquo; you frowned, reaching forward and sweeping a lock of his sweat matted hair back behind his ear. </p><p>You felt as though you could actually physically feel your heart aching for him, the urge to take all of the pain he was feeling away doubling. You also felt as though fire was pumping through your veins, your anger at the woman you had felt at the woman you heard about for the first time tonight tripling. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a problem. You&rsquo;re just sick. Everyone gets sick. And no one should be forced to take care of themselves when they&rsquo;re sick,&rdquo; you stroked his hair, inching closer towards him from your seat on the bathroom floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Especially not when they have someone who loves them so dearly. Because when you love someone, you take care of them. Even when it isn&rsquo;t pretty,&rdquo; you half-joked, trying to get a smile out of him. </p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispered, voice raw from illness.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; you pressed a kiss to his sweaty forehead. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up.&rdquo;</p><p>Half an hour later, you both laid in bed, Harry shirtless and lying on his back, you lying on your side facing him, lightly tracing patterns over his stomach to put it at ease.

It was a little crush really but\nfrom the second he had found out, Nick had made it his mission to get you and\nHarry together, because that\u2019s what friends do apparently. </p><p>\u201cOh Harry,\u201d He sang grabbing you around the arm so you\ncouldn\u2019t escape his side again. </p><p>Across the room you saw Harry look up in curiosity. His\neyebrows furrowed, no doubt confused to why Nick was calling him over yet again\nwhen he didn\u2019t even have something to tell Harry about. Harry moved his eyes\ndown to look at Nick\u2019s hold on your arm and his eyebrows furrowed deeper.</p><p>Pulling your arm back from his hold you continued in another\ndirection and you heard Nick call after you but you continued to find someone\nelse to talk to. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Harry asked as he came up behind you as\nyou were half in Nick\u2019s fridge to find another drink about an hour after you\nlast saw him</p><p>Pulling back, your eyes quickly looked around the kitchen to\nsee if Nick was going to appear out of nowhere with the blasted mistletoe but\nit was only you and Harry. He was looking at your curiously as he leant past you,\narm brushing gently over yours as he also reached in to get another drink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine?\u201d You couldn\u2019t figure out what he meant by his\nquestion. </p><p>\u201cNick, earlier,\u201d He said, twisting the cap off his beer and\nthrowing it back into the bin. \u201cIt\u2019s not like him to hold you like that.\u201d</p><p>A quick smirk pulled at your lips as you figured out what he\nmeant. You felt your chest tighten in happiness as you realised that he cared\nabout you that much to question his best friend. </p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay. Nick\u2019s just being weird.\u201d </p><p>Harry nodded before tipping his drink to you. \u201cThe\nmistletoe.\u201d</p><p>You froze and Harry chuckled. \u201cYou got a problem with\nkissing me.\u201d </p><p>Your jaw dropped, chocking over a breath as you wondered\nwhat to say to him. What the hell. \u201cI-I don\u2019t have a problem kis-kissing you.\u201d\nYou stumbled over a few words and you berated yourself for it.</p><p>Harry took a few steps closer to you and you tensed up a\nbit. There was a smirk covering his pink lips and you wanted to press yours\nagainst them.</p><p>\u201cSo, you wouldn\u2019t mind if I kissed you?\u201d</p><p>He was right in front of you, your back pressed to the\nkitchen counter. Taking a deep breath, you gave him a single nod. This wasn\u2019t\nsomething you thought would happen when you came tonight, you didn\u2019t think Nick\nwould follow you around with mistletoe either but Harry initiating the kiss was\nsomething you thought would never happen.</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand rose and the muffled laughter of the rest of\nthe house fell silent to your ears as you felt the warmth of hand slide along\nthe side of your neck. Leaning forward he knocked his nose along side yours,\nanother hand sliding over your hip to pull you closer.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He asked as you stayed still in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d you breathed out. \u201cDon\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>Harry smiled leaning forward the last little bit to close\nthe distance between you but he halted just before your lips connected with an\nannoyed sigh as you both heard the loud voice. \u201cWait,\u201d Nick yelled from the\ndoorway.</p><p>Taking a few deep breathes your hands shot up to lock around\nHarry\u2019s shirt and you held him tightly to you. The both of you turned to watch as\nNick hurried over to you, digging into his pocket to find the bit of mistletoe\nand hold it over your heads. </p><p>\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d </p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d Harry said, eyes flicking up to the mistletoe\nbefore over to Nick. His hand soothed over your hip and you had to bit your lip\nto keep a smile from forming. </p><p>\u201cKiss her and I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s hand tightened over your hip and he moved forward to\npress a quick kiss against your cheek. You smirked up at Nick as he frowned\ndown at Harry. You felt grateful for the little peck because you really didn\u2019t\nwant Nick watching every detail of your kiss. </p><p>\u201cYou two are fucking boring.\u201d Throwing the mistletoe aside\nhe walked out of the room but he still had a slight skip in his step that\nsuggested he knew the mistletoe didn\u2019t matter anymore. </p><p>\u201cThat kiss didn\u2019t count.\u201d Harry said turning back to you.\nLips hurriedly connecting to yours as his hand tightened around your waist. </p>",
