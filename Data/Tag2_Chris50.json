She had learned during her last year on the job, clients preferred a smooth sort of voice. Nothing too sharp or too girly.<br/>&ldquo;Colin,&rdquo; he replied softly. He sounded lonely, just like ninety percent of the gentlemen that called her line, but a lot youthful.<br/>&ldquo;Good evening Colin, how are you?&rdquo; she followed her usual script, a pen between her lips and her headset nicely fitted around her head. <br/>&ldquo;I&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never done this before,&rdquo; he confessed hesitantly.

She found herself wondering how Colin would look like, if his lips were thin or full&hellip;rosy or dry. It had been a while since she had fallen for someone. She was all study, work, and no play lately and for the first time in months, her heart was fluttering within her chest. <br/>&ldquo;My parents are Russian immigrants,&rdquo; she disclosed, derailing even further from her usual and rehearsed chat. &ldquo;How about you, Colin?&rdquo; <br/>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know much about my heritage, I&rsquo;m originally from Boston.&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I knew I recognized that lovely accent.

She had learned during her last year on the job, clients preferred a smooth sort of voice. Nothing too sharp or too girly.<br />&ldquo;Colin,&rdquo; he replied softly. He sounded lonely, just like ninety percent of the gentlemen that called her line, but a lot youthful.<br />&ldquo;Good evening Colin, how are you?&rdquo; she followed her usual script, a pen between her lips and her headset nicely fitted around her head. <br />&ldquo;I&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never done this before,&rdquo; he confessed hesitantly. Most men also said this even though they were regulars. <br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to call, Colin,&rdquo; she continued with her canned responses, telling him kindly, &ldquo;I have a feeling we&rsquo;ll get along just fine,&rdquo; she added.<br />&ldquo;In this business card, it doesn&rsquo;t say your name, just the name of your company and their contact information,&rdquo; Colin pointed out.<br />&ldquo;My name is Ivy,&rdquo; she disclosed warmly.<br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real name?&rdquo; Colin insisted, his voice clouded and lonelier. She unconsciously enjoyed the sound of it. Its virility and young sounding tone was nice for a change.<br />&ldquo;&hellip;Ivanna,&rdquo; she uttered after a long pause, breaking the rules of her contract. <br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip;different, I like it,&rdquo; said Colin, and she could almost hear him smiling while he spoke. She found herself wondering how Colin would look like, if his lips were thin or full&hellip;rosy or dry. It had been a while since she had fallen for someone. She was all study, work, and no play lately and for the first time in months, her heart was fluttering within her chest. <br />&ldquo;My parents are Russian immigrants,&rdquo; she disclosed, derailing even further from her usual and rehearsed chat. &ldquo;How about you, Colin?&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know much about my heritage, I&rsquo;m originally from Boston.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I knew I recognized that lovely accent. I have a friend in college from Boston,&rdquo; Ivanna added and she was imagining Colin now: he had a handsome face and he was six feet tall and his smile could melt an iceberg.<br />&ldquo;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t tell me which college or I would find you and take you out on a date,&rdquo; he joked and there was that smiling voice of his again.<br />&ldquo;Why did you call, Colin?&rdquo; Ivanna&rsquo;s heart stopped now, she remembered he was a total stranger and he could potentially be a creep even. She had been warned time after time, their identities were to remain anonymous at all cost, for their safety. <br />&hellip;Could creeps be this charming to talk to, though?&hellip;.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been partying too hard lately, Ivanna. My girl dumped me, my best friend won&rsquo;t answer my calls and&hellip; I woke up this morning with a needle in my arm and a working girl in my bed.&rdquo; &nbsp;he took a deep breath before resuming. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost everything and I just&hellip;needed to connect.&rdquo; <br />His honesty made her sit up briskly on her bed, Colin was trouble, but he was also in trouble. Why did he have to stumble on her line out of all the lines that the one main number lead to? Why wasn&rsquo;t he like the other older gentlemen that called three nights a week, just looking for some feminine voice to jerk off to? <br />&ldquo;Did I scare you off, Ivanna?&rdquo; Colin asked concerned.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, Colin,&rdquo; she needed to retake the reins of the conversation somehow, &ldquo;How did you find out about us?<br />\"Somebody left your business&rsquo;s card laying on the floor, in the lobby of my office,&rdquo; he explained sounding slightly less lonely, &ldquo; How did you get into phone sex therapy, Ivanna? Bartending too hard to get into?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Are you really judging my means of income?&rdquo; She could take that sort of comment from the old guys, but not from Colin.<br />&ldquo;No, please, I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Colin interjected remorsefully. &ldquo;I swear, I wasn&rsquo;t. Curiosity got the best of me and you are going to think I&rsquo;m a perv&hellip; but I feel like the fact that I don&rsquo;t have to censor myself when I talk to you,&rdquo; he clarified and Ivanna felt an involuntary warmth gathering between her legs. His voice was doing things to her body, she couldn&rsquo;t control.<br />&ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; she pictured him in a shady hotel room, wearing only his boxers, slightly unshaved and staring up at her. <br />&ldquo;Thank you for giving me another chance,&rdquo; he spoke sensually, his mouth so close to the phone, she could hear him clearly and it was eerie. She bit her bottom lip.<br />&ldquo;Would you like me to help you find some relief, Colin?&rdquo; she asked another of her scripted questions, but Colin remained silent.<br />&ldquo;I would like nothing more than that, Ivanna, someday, after I&rsquo;ve taken you to several proper dates and I have you naked on my bed and I make love to you the way you deserve,&rdquo; he spoke fast, but confident, it made her damp and wanting. &ldquo;But tonight I&rsquo;m not that person, Ivanna, I&rsquo;m just a junkie and a shitty boyfriend and an even worse friend and I&rsquo;m paying your company by the minute for you to lend me your ear.&rdquo; She listened entirely too focused on every word he pronounced. His throat closing up on him when he spoke. &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m just not there.&ldquo;<br />\"Where are you tonight, Colin?&rdquo; She stood up from her bed and grabbed her coat, she didn&rsquo;t even care she was only wearing pajamas. &ldquo;If you are in the city I can be there in a minute, just&hellip; please don&rsquo;t go down that road again, let&rsquo;s hang out!&rdquo; she offered eagerly and hopeless.<br />&ldquo;Make sure they are nice to you, Ivanna. Good night,&rdquo; <br />&ldquo;No, Colin! Wait!&rdquo; She screamed at her phone, but the line had gone dead.</p><p>***To Be Continued***</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure></p>",

On his walk alone he encounters something unusual, he has not seen a human anywhere in sight since the snap and to his surprise he sees her. helping her cope with all of her loss. they end up forming a stronger bond.  </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"228\" data-orig-width=\"540\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b131216a9cfd9489a04fe49c7b6e555e/tumblr_inline_pr7x01qHgO1w57764_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"228\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>A few weeks had passed by since that kiss had happened, you and Steve hadn\u2019t talked about it but the two of you had formed a close bond with one another. Everyone could see how mesmerized he was by you, every time you would walk by he would perk up, or whenever he heard you speak his body would relax. Sometimes he was teased by Bruce or Nat about it, but he would just roll his eyes and walk off.

Thank you and enjoy </p><p>Warning: </p><p><b>Summary</b>: As time passed by almost 50 percent of nature had been wiped out, Steve had tried his hardest to deal with all of the pain of losing everyone who was close to him, and keeping his sanity together for the sake of the Avengers who were alive. On his walk alone he encounters something unusual, he has not seen a human anywhere in sight since the snap and to his surprise he sees her. helping her cope with all of her loss. they end up forming a stronger bond.  </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b131216a9cfd9489a04fe49c7b6e555e/tumblr_inline_pr7x01qHgO1w57764_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>A few weeks had passed by since that kiss had happened, you and Steve hadn&rsquo;t talked about it but the two of you had formed a close bond with one another. Everyone could see how mesmerized he was by you, every time you would walk by he would perk up, or whenever he heard you speak his body would relax. Sometimes he was teased by Bruce or Nat about it, but he would just roll his eyes and walk off. Even though Steve loved being around you, he was still afraid sometimes, thinking about what would happen if he didn&rsquo;t survive to see you again, or even worse what if Thanos would take you away from him. He couldn&rsquo;t bear to let anything happen to you, he was very protective of you ever since the moment he laid his eyes on you. If you&rsquo;d fall, or if you&rsquo;d cut yourself he&rsquo;d be right there to help you, to soothe your pain. He cared deeply for you and this made you feel happy inside, but you weren&rsquo;t sure how long this would last, which made you frown. So you did what you did was best and cherished every moment you had with him.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;What if we just&hellip;steal the stones from him?&rdquo; Nat had asked,&nbsp;&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it be easy?&rdquo; as the conversation continued about Thanos and the stones, you had been standing outside listening in to everything they had been saying. They had been in the room for hours, sometimes coming in and out of the room to eat or getting a drink. When it got darker the meeting had been over and they all had gone to bed for the night. You had seen Steve walk out and he smiled placing his hand on your shoulder&nbsp;&ldquo;You should get some sleep.&rdquo; he said and placed a gentle kiss on your head and walked away. You looked at him until he faded in the dark and you walked towards your room sighing, hoping you&rsquo;d get the chance to talk with him the next day. You laid in bed and fell asleep, a few hours later something had woke you up, you sat up hearing music coming from down the hall.&nbsp;&ldquo;What the?&rdquo; you opened the door and you could see the light inside of the board room on. As you walked closer you could hear Billie Holiday playing inside of the room when you looked inside the room you had seen Steve gazing down at a photo, you couldn&rsquo;t quite make out who the photo was of.&nbsp;&ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; you called his name and he put the photo away inside of his pocket and turned around seeing you in the doorway.&nbsp;</p><p>He said nothing but pulled you into the room and embraced you into his arms, he placed his chin on top of your head and began to sway slowly to the music which made you sway slowly along with him. You had rested your cheek against his chest hearing his steady heartbeat, and taking in all his warmth. You closed your eyes as you continued swaying along with him to the slow song, you wanted this moment to last forever, but you knew that it would eventually have to end. Both of you continued to dance like this until he had cleared his throat&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/n?&rdquo; he said, you opened your eyes and looked up into his blue eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Steve?&rdquo; Steve smiled at you before placing a soft kiss against your lips and pulling away to hold you close to him.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you for bringing light into my darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When the music had stopped Steve had walked you back to the room, both hand in hand.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll be seeing you tomorrow then?&rdquo; you said causing Steve to chuckle softly&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course miss y/l/n.&rdquo;&nbsp; the both of you sighed deeply, and Steve placed his hands inside of his pockets and stared down at the floor. &ldquo;Say, you wanna come in?&rdquo; you asked, His head perked up at the comment you made, &ldquo;Technically it IS your room,&rdquo; you said chuckling. You opened the door to the room and the both of you walked inside. Steve had closed the door behind him slowly. You had sat down on the bed and patted the empty space next to you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Come sit,&rdquo; you said smiling, Steve had hesitated for a moment but eventually sat next to you.&nbsp;</p><p>You had moved closer to Steve and the both of you had been silent for a moment as you gazed into each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;I should really go,&rdquo; he said, before he stood up you held his hand&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay with me? just until I fall asleep at least.&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t resist being close to you, so he nodded and leaned against the headboard, You followed after him and rested your head against his shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this night to ever end,&rdquo; you said sighing deeply, Steve rested his head against yours and smiled&nbsp;&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo; Both of you spent almost the whole night talking about things in your past, he told you stories about his life back in his time and you told him stories about your life.
