Tyrion is a much less obvious foil of the Beast,\nbecause both his appearance and his character align well with Cocteau\u2019s Beast\nup until ASOS, where he was still toeing the line between hero and villain.\nDespite that, after analyzing the scenes Tyrion and Sansa have together, it\nbecomes apparent that the dynamic between them is meant to be juxtaposed with\nthe one between Beauty and the Beast and not paralleled.</p><p>Since this gets rather lengthy, the rest can be read under the cut.</p><!-- more --><p>There is no better chapter to showcase this than the one where Sansa and\nTyrion get married, which bears a striking resemblance to the scene of the\nfirst dinner the Beast and Beauty share. Even before the actual wedding, GRRM\nestablishes a connection between the two scenes by having Sansa and Beauty\ndressed in a similar way as we see below:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the great hall the clock strikes seven. On each side of the blazing fire\nthe marble busts turn their heads. Beauty is sitting at the table, wearing a <b>dark\njeweled dress</b>, <b>with matching jewels round her neck and wound into her\nhair.</b> The hand from the candelabra on the table picks up the silver wine\ndecanter to serve her. <b>She leans back in her chair with a sigh of despair\nand closes her eyes.</b> The door opens behind her and the Beast crosses the\nroom. He stands behind her, leaning on the back of the chair.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed\nSansa in her new clothes. The smallclothes were all silk, but <b>the gown\nitself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin</b>.\nThe points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she\nlowered her arms. And it was a woman\u2019s gown, not a little girl\u2019s, there was no\ndoubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep\nvee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts\nwere long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as\nthey laced her into it. They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft\ngrey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers. </i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>Queen Cersei studied her critically. \u201cA few gems, I think. The moonstones\nJoffrey gave her.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cAt once, Your Grace,\u201d her maid replied. </i></p><p><b><i>When the moonstones hung from Sansa\u2019s ears and about her neck,</i></b><i> the queen nodded.</i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe cloak,\u201d she commanded, and the women brought it out: <b>a long cloak\nof white velvet heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon\nit in silver thread. Sansa looked at it with sudden dread. \u201cYour father\u2019s\ncolors,\u201d said Cersei, as they fastened it about her neck with a slender silver\nchain.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=moonstones+hung+Sansa%27s+ears&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Sansa\"><b>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Both Sansa and Beauty are dressed in jeweled dresses and wear a necklace\nand a hairnet that matches the outfit. What\u2019s interesting is that despite those\nsimilarities there is an inversion of color, considering Beauty wears a dark\ngown and Sansa a white one, which, from the very beginning sets the tone for\nthe subversion to follow. </p><p>This subversion becomes obvious not only by examining the context of the\nSansa/Tyrion scene, but also by the reverse order in which GRRM put the\nSansa/Tyrion scenes in comparison to the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d one.</p><p>The beginning of the dialogue in the Beauty and the Beast scene goes as\nfollows:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Don&rsquo;t be afraid.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (<b>summoning up all her courage</b>): I &hellip; I\nwon&rsquo;t be afraid.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Beauty, do you mind if I watch you while\nyou dine?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You are the master.</i></p><p><i>BEAST: No, I&rsquo;m not. </i></p><p><i>(He pauses for a moment.) </i></p><p><i>There is no master here but you. </i></p><p><i>(He moves around to the side of the chair.)</i></p><p><b><i>I revolt you; you must find me very ugly.</i></b></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I cannot lie, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Is everything here to your liking?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I feel uneasy dressed in such finery, nor am I\nused to being waited upon.But I know you&rsquo;re doing your utmost to help me forget\nyour ugliness.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (walking over to the fireplace): <b>My heart\nis kind, but I am a monster.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Many men are more monstrous than you, but they\nhide it well.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Besides my ugliness, I am lacking in\nwit.</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You have wit enough to realize it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Everything in this castle is yours. Your\nevery whim will be fulfilled.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Before the dialogue begins, the Beast uses his magic to serve her some wine\n(as you can read in the introduction of the scene) and the first thing he does\nis try to soothe her fear. When she tells him she will not be afraid of him, he\nasks for her consent to watch her do something as commonplace as dine. After\nthat the Beast leads the conversation to his ugliness, about which Beauty\nrefuses to lie and then he proceeds to talk about his virtue (his kindness) and\nhis faults (his ugliness and his lack in wit). </p><p>The above dialogue was the thing that inspired the scene Sansa and Tyrion Lannister\nshare in \u201ctheir\u201d bedroom <b>after</b> their\nwedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>For their wedding night, they had been granted the use of an airy\nbedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion kicked the door shut behind\nthem. <b>\u201cThere is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard, Sansa. Will\nyou be so kind as to pour me a cup?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI am your husband. You can take off your armor now.\u201d</i></b><i> </i></p><p><i>\u201cAnd my clothing?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cThat too.\u201d He waved his wine cup at her. \u201cMy lord father has commanded me\nto consummate this marriage.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes. She had ten thumbs\ninstead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the\nlaces and buttons, and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the\nfloor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes. Gooseprickles\ncovered her arms and legs. She kept her eyes on the floor, too shy to look at\nhim, but when she was done <b>she glanced up and found him staring.</b> There\nwas hunger in his green eye, it seemed to her, and fury in the black. Sansa did\nnot know which scared her more. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a child,\u201d he said. </i></p><p><i>She covered her breasts with her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve flowered.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cA child,\u201d he repeated, <b>\u201cbut I want you. Does that frighten you, Sansa?</b>\u201d\n</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cYes.\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cMe as well. <b>I know I am ugly</b> - </i></p><p><b><i>\u201cNo, my -if </i></b></p><p><i>He pushed himself to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Sansa. <b>I am malformed,\nscarred, and small,</b> but&hellip;\u201d she could see him groping \u201c&hellip; abed, when the\ncandles are blown out, <b>I am made no\nworse than other men</b>.

A scented beeswax\ncandle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had been strewn between the\nsheets. <b>She had started to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard\nhim say, \u201cNo.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>The cold made her shiver, but she obeyed.</i></b></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>\u201cOn my honor as a Lannister,\u201d the Imp said, <b>\u201cI will not touch you until\nyou want me to.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>It took all the courage that was in her to look in those mismatched eyes\nand say, <b>\u201cAnd if I never want you to, my lord?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>His mouth jerked as if she had slapped him. \u201cNever?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her neck was so tight <b>she could scarcely nod.</b></i></p><p><i>\u201cWhy,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is why the gods made whores for imps like me.\u201d He\nclosed his short blunt fingers into a fist, and climbed down off the bed.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=I+could+be+good+to+you+kind&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Sansa\"><b><i>A Storm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The subversive tone set up earlier, while Sansa was dressing for the\nwedding continues the bedroom scene, by having Tyrion ask Sansa to pour him the\nwine instead of serving her himself like the Beast did using his magic. After a\nbit of conversation unrelated to this analysis, Tyrion orders Sansa to undress.\nWhen she follows his instructions Tyrion stands there and watches her perform\nthis intimate act without asking for her consent, which comes in direct opposition\nto what the Beast did, which was ask for Beauty\u2019s consent to watch her <i>eat</i>.\n</p><p>After that, the discussion between them follows the same themes as the one\nbetween Beauty and the Beast but the vibe each of them gives off is very\ndifferent. The first thing the Beast tells Beauty is \u201cDo not be afraid\u201d to\nassure her that she is safe from him. Instead of soothing Sansa\u2019s fear though,\nthe first thing Tyrion does is to intensify it with his confession that he lusts\nafter her even though he sees she is just a child and then asks her whether\nhe\u2019s frightening her with that admission. Sansa in turn replies that she is\nindeed afraid of Tyrion, unlike Beauty, who said she would not be afraid of the\nBeast. This of course is to be expected, considering Tyrion did threaten Sansa\nwith marital rape when the Beast never threatened Beauty in any way.</p><p>The moment Sansa admits her fear would have been ideal for Tyrion to try\nand comfort her by telling her she had nothing to fear from him, but instead of\nthat, he steers the conversation away from Sansa\u2019s fear and towards himself and\nhis own \u201cfear\u201d of lusting after a child, exhibiting a rather alarming disregard\nof Sansa\u2019s feelings.</p><p>After that, Tyrion starts talking about his appearance, stating, like the\nBeast, that he knows that Sansa finds him ugly. Beauty replied that she could\nnot lie to the Beast about it, but Sansa, already terrified, does try to lie to\nTyrion, in order to protect herself from his impending (as far as she knows)\nwrath. Tyrion then goes on to talk about his fault (his ugliness) and his\nvirtues (his generosity, his bravery, his cleverness and his kindness). </p><p>At first glance, his little speech resembles the one the Beast makes, but\non closer inspection they prove to be opposites, because the Beast focuses on\nhis faults, offering only one virtue, when Tyrion focuses on his virtues,\ngiving Sansa only one fault. In essence, the Beast was selling himself short,\nmaking no attempts to endear himself to Beauty before asking her to marry him,\nwhen on the other hand Tyrion was overselling himself, trying to become more\ndesirable in her eyes to convince her to have sex with him.</p><p>This is a very important part of the subversion, because, as has already\nbeen analyzed in the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta series, in the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d\nadaptations that follow the themes of Villenueve\u2019s original one (like\nCocteau&rsquo;s), Beauty must know exactly what she&rsquo;s getting herself into before\nagreeing to marry the Beast. That means that the Beast (or in other cases\nBeauty&rsquo;s father) must lay all his cards on the table and not try to endear\nhimself to Beauty through pretty words. </p><p>Tyrion though, not only tries to make himself appear more desirable in her\neyes through that little speech, but also gives it to Sansa <b>after</b> the\nmarriage proposal and not before, like the Beast is supposed to. This inverse\norder, as mentioned above, ties into the subversion too, as it is meant to\nshowcase how Tyrion is the Beast&rsquo;s foil that does everything backwards. </p><p>As mentioned above, after the Beast talks about himself to Belle, he asks\nher to marry him. We can see that in the rest of the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d dinner\nscene cited below:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST (walking back to the dining table): I shall\nappear every evening at seven. <b>Before leaving I shall ask you a question</b>;\nit will always be the same one.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: What is your question?</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty, will you be my wife?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>No, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Farewell then</b>, Beauty. Until\ntomorrow. </i></p><p><i>He leaves the room.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The ending of the scene is very straightforward. The Beast informs Beauty\nthat he will be asking her a question every day. That question is whether\nBeauty will be his wife. When she tells him no, he respects her answer and\nleaves, promising to ask again the next day. </p><p>This sequence I believe is meant to be juxtaposed with the one right before\nSansa and Tyrion\u2019s wedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>His face darkened. \u201cI am. I\u2019m your father, and I can marry you to whoever I\nlike. To anyone. You\u2019ll marry the pig boy if I say so, and bed down with him in\nthe sty.\u201d His green eyes glittered with amusement. \u201cOr maybe I should give you\nto Ilyn Payne, would you like him better?\u201d </i></p><p><i>Her heart lurched. \u201cPlease, Your Grace,\u201d she begged. \u201cIf you ever loved me\neven a little bit, <b>don\u2019t make me marry your\u2212\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>\u201c\u2212uncle?\u201dTyrion wore a doublet of black velvet covered with golden\nscrollwork, thigh-high boots that added three inches to his height, a chain of\nrubies and lions\u2019 heads. But the gash across his face was raw and red, and his\nnose was a hideous scab. \u201cYou are very beautiful, Sansa,\u201d he told her. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is good of you to say so, my lord.\u201d She did not know what else to say.\nShould I tell him he is handsome? He\u2019ll think me a fool or a liar. She lowered\nher gaze and held her tongue.</i></p><p><i>\u201c<b>My lady, this is no way to bring you to your wedding</b>. I am sorry\nfor that. And for making this <b>so sudden, and so secret</b>. My lord father\nfelt it necessary, for reasons of state. Else I would have come to you sooner,\nas I wished.\u201d He waddled closer. \u201c<b>You did not ask for this marriage, I know.</b>\nNo more than I did. If I had refused you, however, they would have wed you to\nmy cousin Lancel. Perhaps you would prefer that. He is nearer your age, and\nfairer to look upon. If that is your wish, say so, and I will end this farce.\u201d </i></p><p><b><i>I don\u2019t want any Lannister</i></b><i>, she wanted to\nsay. I want Willas, I want Highgarden and the puppies and the barge, and sons\nnamed Eddard and Bran and Rickon. But then she remembered what Dontos had told\nher in the godswood. Tyrell or Lannister, it makes no matter, it\u2019s not me they\nwant, only my claim. <b>\u201cYou are kind, my lord,\u201d she said, defeated. \u201cI am a\nward of the throne and my duty is to marry as the king commands.\u201d</b> </i></p><p><i>He studied her with his mismatched eyes. \u201cI know I am not the sort of\nhusband young girls dream of, Sansa,\u201d he said softly, \u201cbut neither am I\nJoffrey.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were kind to me.

On one hand we have Sansa\nbeing escorted to the Sept at sword-point and Tyrion recognizing that he should\nhave handled the \u201cproposal\u201d differently. On the other hand we have Beauty\nshowing up for dinner (not the actual wedding) on her own volition, with no\nthreats or coercion involved and the Beast proposing to her, but in no way\nimposing this marriage on her by making the decision for her, or presenting it\nto her as a fait accompli, the way Tyrion did.</p><p>Furthermore, when the Beast proposed, he fully expected Beauty&rsquo;s refusal\nand he was prepared\u00a0to respect her decision and try again the next day.\nWhen Sansa spoke against this marriage in front of Tyrion though, in the very\nbeginning of the scene, he didn&rsquo;t stop the ceremony, nor did he resolve to try\nagain the day after. On the contrary, he tried to coerce Sansa into marrying\nhim right on that instant, basically telling her she was getting married to a\nLannister that day one way or another. </p><p>Some would say that Tyrion did offer Sansa a way out, but did he really?\nConsidering the talk Tyrion had with his father and uncle before the wedding, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=but+consummate+kevan&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">Lancel was not an\noption</a> and all that speculation between Tywin and Kevan on\nwho would become Sansa&rsquo;s husband instead of him <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=+byplay+for+his+benefit&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">was\njust a byplay for his benefit</a> and <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=you+will+marry+Sansa+stark+and+soon&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">not\nactual options</a>. Even if it was an actual choice, Sansa would still\nhave had to take a Lannister husband that day and she didn\u2019t want to marry any\nLannister, no matter how comely he was. So she resigned to her fate,\n\u201cconsenting\u201d to the marriage, because, obviously, saying \u201cno\u201d was not an\noption. This of course is once again juxtaposed with Belle, to whom Beast gave\nall the power and agency to decide for her fate and whose wish not to take the\nBeast as her husband was respected throughout the film.</p><p>At this point I believe it is important to note that in the original\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d fairytale the Beast didn\u2019t ask for Beauty\u2019s hand in\nmarriage, but rather for her to come into his bed:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Suddenly the Beast asked her if she would allow him to sleep with her. </i></b></p><p><i>At this unexpected request, <b>all Beauty&rsquo;s fears were revived</b>. She uttered a terrible shriek, and\nexclaimed, in spite of herself, &ldquo;Oh! Heavens, I am lost!&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; the Beast quietly replied; &ldquo;but without\nfrightening yourself, answer me properly: say precisely yes or no!&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><b><i>Trembling, Beauty answered, &ldquo;No, Beast.&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well then, <b>since\nyou will not let me</b>,&rdquo; returned the docile creature, &ldquo;<b>I shall leave you</b>. Good-night,\nBeauty.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good-night, Beast,&rdquo; said the <b>frightened maiden, much relieved</b>.</i></p><p><b><i>Beauty and the Beast by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villenueve (translation\nfrom french)</i></b></p></blockquote><p>GRRM seems to follow both versions simultaneously in this storyline with\nSansa and Tyrion, considering Tyrion forced Sansa both into marriage and into\nsex, stopping only at the last minute before initiating intercourse.</p><p>What is rather interesting is that it wasn\u2019t Sansa who said she wouldn\u2019t\nsleep with him, but Tyrion himself:</p><blockquote><p><i>When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her\nbreast, Sansa could not help but shudder. <b>She\nlay with her eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.</b>\nWould he touch her again? Kiss her? Should she open her legs for him now? She\ndid not know what was expected of her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sansa.&rdquo; The hand was gone. &ldquo;Open your\neyes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>She had promised to obey</i></b><i>; she opened her eyes. He was sitting by her feet, naked. Where his legs\njoined, his man&rsquo;s staff poked up stiff and hard from a thicket of coarse yellow\nhair, but it was the only thing about him that was straight.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; Tyrion said, &ldquo;<b>you are lovely, make no mistake, but\u2026 I\ncannot do this</b>. My father be damned. <b>We\nwill wait</b>. The turn of a moon, a year, a season, however long it takes.\nUntil you have come to know me better, and perhaps to trust me a little.&rdquo;\nHis smile might have been meant to be reassuring, but without a nose it only\nmade him look more grotesque and sinister.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=She+had+promised+to+obey+opened+eyes&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Sansa&rsquo;s obedience despite her lack of consent is to be attributed to the\nfact that Tyrion himself had already made it more than clear that she had no\nsay in the matter:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the Imp confessed, &ldquo;but not so\ndrunk that I cannot attend to my own bedding.&rdquo; He hopped down from the\ndais and <b>grabbed Sansa roughly.\n&ldquo;Come, wife, time to smash your portcullis. I want to play come-into-the-castle.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Red-faced, Sansa went with him from the Small Hall. <b>What choice do I have?</b> Tyrion waddled\nwhen he walked, especially when he walked as quickly as he did now. The gods\nwere merciful, and neither Joffrey nor any of the others moved to follow.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Play+come+into+my+castle+portcullis&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>\u201cI am your husband.

We\nneed to do our duty.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>She climbed onto the featherbed, conscious of his\nstare. A scented beeswax candle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had\nbeen strewn between the sheets. <b>She had\nstarted to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard him say, \u201cNo.\u201d</b></i></p><p><b><i>The cold made her shiver, but she obeyed.</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Get+in+the+bed+need+sansa+do+duty&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>In all of the above passages Tyrion is the one giving the orders and Sansa\nthe one obeying them, knowing she has no other choice but sleep with him. And\nthat is because Tyrion himself doesn\u2019t present her with the option to say no;\nsomething that establishes him as a foil to the Beast. Yes, he does have a\nchange of heart at the last moment due to his crisis of conscience, but that\ndoes not negate all the things he said and did before that. And the fact that\nit is ultimately Tyrion who decides that there would be no consummation and not\nSansa, inverts the power dynamics of the original fairytale and erases the\nsovereignty of Sansa\u2019s consent.</p><p>Now, back to the comparison between Cocteau\u2019s film and ASOIAF, we see that\nthe time Sansa and Tyrion spend together as husband and wife/prisoner is cut\nshort, due to Sansa\u2019s escape from King\u2019s Landing to go to her \u201cfather\u201d\n(Littlefinger is not Sansa\u2019s real father, but he fills that role anyway). </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s escape takes place during a feast she attends with Tyrion, while\nshe is dressed in a silver and purple gown and wearing her \u201camethyst\u201d hairnet.\nThis is a callback to the following scene in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d: </p><p><i>Beauty is in the great hall, walking up and down in\nfront of the fire. She is\u00a0wearing a dark velvet dress. The marble busts at\neach end of the mantlepiece turn their heads to watch her. The clock strikes\nhalf past seven. Beauty looks up at the clock and sees the Beast&rsquo;s reflection\nin the mirror above it. \u00a0She turns round\nas he walks across the room.</i></p><blockquote><p><i>BEAUTY: How late you are!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Thank you, Beauty, for noticing.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, I was awaiting you with great impatience,\nBeast. </i></p><p><i>She throws herself to her knees and grabs his cloak.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I must talk to you!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (shocked): Beauty! Beauty!</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (still on her knees, pleading): <b>I cannot live another day without seeing my\nfather again. Please let me go, I beg you!</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Stand up, Beauty, stand up.</i></p><p><i>He pulls her to her feet and leads her to a chair. He\nsits down beside her.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: I should be on my knees taking orders from\nyou. </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (almost in tears): <b>Let me go. I promise to return.</b> </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: And when you return, will you be my wife? </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (in despair): You&rsquo;re torturing me.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\nknow I&rsquo;m repulsive.</b> <b>But I would die\nof heartbreak if I let you go and you took advantage of your freedom never to return.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I&rsquo;d\ncome back in a week&rsquo;s time. I respect you too much to cause your death.</b></i></p><p><i>The Beast lowers his head. Beauty strokes it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (looking up at her): You coax me as though I\nwere an animal.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (gently): But you are an animal.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Your\nrequest is a very serious matter. I must think about it.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>In this scene the Beast shows up late for dinner and Beauty falls to her\nknees before him and begs him to let her go back to her father. The Beast\ndespairs at her request and tells her he will think of it and a few days later,\nhe visits her chambers and makes up his mind:</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty is lying on the bed. The Beast walks over to\nthe foot of the bed.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty,\nare you ill?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, Beast. I am. </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: What ails you?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I know my father&rsquo;s dying.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\ncan&rsquo;t bear to see you waste away.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>Send me\nhome to my father.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST:<b> If</b>\n<b>I agree, will you promise to return in a\nweek&rsquo;s time, to the very day?</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (smiling at him): <b>I promise.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>When he sees her sorrow at having to stay away from her dying father, he\nrelents and lets her go under the condition that she will return to him. He\nputs his faith in her, despite knowing he will die if she doesn\u2019t keep her\nword, because her wellbeing and happiness is more important to him than his\nown.</p><p>Tyrion sees Sansa&rsquo;s sorrow before the feast too, but instead of making him\nwant to let her go, it made him want to trap her in another castle instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Their litter had been sitting in the sun, and it was\nvery warm inside the curtains. As they lurched into motion, Tyrion reclined on\nan elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands. She is just as comely as the\nTyrell girl. Her hair was a rich autumn auburn, her eyes a deep Tully blue. <b>Grief had given her a haunted, vulnerable\nlook; if anything, it had only made her more beautiful.</b> He wanted to reach\nher, to break through the armor of her courtesy. Was that what made him speak?\nOr just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder?</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again, we might\njourney to Casterly Rock.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Far from Joffrey and my sister. The more he thought\nabout what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings, the more it troubled him.\nThere was a message there, oh yes. <b>&ldquo;It\nwould please me to show you the Golden Gallery and the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth, and the\nHall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys. You can hear thunder from\nbelow where the sea comes in &hellip;&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>She raised her head slowly. He knew what she was\nseeing; the swollen brutish brow, the raw stump of his nose, his crooked pink\nscar and mismatched eyes. <b>Her own eyes\nwere big and blue and empty. &ldquo;I shall go wherever my lord husband\nwishes.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Hear+thunder+from+below+sea+comes+in&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Tyrion VIII</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>And he was provided with a chance to let Sansa go right after that, but he\ndidn&rsquo;t take it, choosing to change the subject instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Lady Olenna smiled. &ldquo;I am pleased to say <b>I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day\nafter next.</b> I have had quite enough of this smelly city, thank you. Perhaps\nyou would like to accompany me for a little visit, whilst the men are off\nhaving their war? I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully, and all her lovely\nladies. <b>Your company would be such sweet\nsolace.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are too kind, my lady,&rdquo; said Sansa,\n&ldquo;but <b>my place is with my lord\nhusband.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Lady Olenna gave Tyrion a wrinkled, toothless smile.\n&ldquo;Oh? Forgive a silly old woman, my lord, I did not mean to steal your\nlovely wife. I assumed you would be off leading a Lannister host against some\nwicked foe.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A host of dragons and stags.

Considering the circumstances though, it\nwould have been death to utter such a wish to anyone in court, much less her\nLannister husband to whom she got married against her will. Still, Tyrion had\nguessed she wanted to be free, as demonstrated in the following quotes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Lord Stark asked for his sisters</b> and his father\u2019s sword as well,\u201d\nSer Cleos reminded him.</i></p><p><i>Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark\u2019s greatsword rising\nover one shoulder. \u201cIce,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that when he makes his peace\nwith us, not before.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs you say. And his sisters?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Tyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as he said, \u201cUntil\nsuch time as he frees my brother Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as\nhostages.</i></b><i> How well they are treated depends on him.\u201d And if the\ngods are good, Bywater will find Arya alive, before Robb learns she\u2019s gone\nmissing.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Sansa+stab+of+pity&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\"><b>A\nClash of Kings - Tyrion VI</b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of his nose. The scar tissue itched\nabominably sometimes.<b> \u201cHis Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa\u2019s life a\nmisery since the day her father died, and now that she is finally rid of\nJoffrey you propose to marry her to me. That seems singularly cruel. Even for\nyou, Father.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>\u201cIf your purpose here is to keep her from the Tyrells, <b>why not return\nher to her mother?</b> Perhaps that would convince Robb Stark to bend the\nknee.\u201d</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>\u201cYou shall never have Casterly Rock, I promise you. But wed Sansa Stark,\nand it is just possible that you might win Winterfell.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Tyrion Lannister, Lord Protector of Winterfell.

Oh, Mother, no, not that, they haven\u2019t\nharmed her, not that way, only&hellip; a bird came last night, but I couldn\u2019t bring\nmyself to tell you, not until your father was sent to his rest.\u201d Robb took her\nhand. <b>\u201cThey married her to Tyrion Lannister.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Catelyn\u2019s fingers clutched at his. \u201cThe Imp.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHe swore to trade her for his brother,\u201d</i></b><i> she said numbly.\n\u201cSansa and Arya both. We would have them back if we returned his precious\nJaime, he swore it before the whole court. <b>How could he marry her, after\nsaying that in sight of gods and men?\u201d</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Catelyn%27s+fingers+clutched+at+his.+%22The+Imp.%22&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Catelyn\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Catelyn IV</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The fact that Sansa had to resort to escaping from the Red Keep in secret,\nwithout asking for Tyrion&rsquo;s permission stems from his own inability to cast his\nLannister loyalties aside and do right by her by letting her go, as\ndemonstrated in the above quotes. This once again is meant to accentuate how\ndifferent Tyrion is from Cocteau\u2019s Beast in that regard, putting his own fears\nbefore Sansa&rsquo;s needs and happiness.</p><p>Despite Tyrion not giving her his permission to leave, Sansa leaves him\nanyway. And since Tyrion is not the one to release her, she leaves with no strings\nattached. This of course means that since Tyrion never made her promise him she\nwould return, as the Beast had, Sansa never came back for him, even though she\nknew he was facing capital punishment.</p><p>This development in my opinion is GRRM\u2019s in-text critique of the Stockholm\nsyndrome usually associated with the more modernized version of the tale of\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d that has been established after the Disney film came out.\n</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty and the Beast is often accused of supporting a\n\u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d romance. In reality, it reflects what arranged marriages\nwere often like at the time, and the Beast is much kinder than husbands had to\nbe. Disney\u2019s film updates the story for a modern audience, but it does so\nproblematically. The drama of the original story was drawn from Beauty\ndiscovering that things are not always as they appear while Disney\u2019s drama is\ndrawn from Belle taming Beast.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.germmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-beauty-and-the-beast/\"><i>The\nEvolution of Beauty and the Beast</i></a></b><b></b></p></blockquote><p>As established on the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta, Sansa&rsquo;s arc could very well be the result of GRRM\u2019s\ngrievances with Disney&rsquo;s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d adaptation, which actually has\nBelle fall in love with the Beast due to Stockholm syndrome and not because\nhe&rsquo;s being kind and respectful of her like in the original fairytale. </p><p>Tyrion was not as cruel as Joffrey or as vicious as the Hound, but he was a\nfoil to Cocteau&rsquo;s Beast nevertheless. And in order to demonstrate how Tyrion\nwas not worthy of Sansa&rsquo;s love, GRRM never had Sansa fall in love with him or\ncare for him enough to go back and save him, subverting the very problematic\nStockholm Syndrome romance trope Disney established.</p><p>Once more I\u2019d like to thank <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwWZHOYYX4qznCWYcc2asUw\">@kellyvela</a> who have\nmade the writing of this meta possible with their wonderful ideas and their constant\nsupport.</p>",

Even before the actual wedding, GRRM\nestablishes a connection between the two scenes by having Sansa and Beauty\ndressed in a similar way as we see below:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the great hall the clock strikes seven. On each side of the blazing fire\nthe marble busts turn their heads. Beauty is sitting at the table, wearing a <b>dark\njeweled dress</b>, <b>with matching jewels round her neck and wound into her\nhair.</b> The hand from the candelabra on the table picks up the silver wine\ndecanter to serve her. <b>She leans back in her chair with a sigh of despair\nand closes her eyes.</b> The door opens behind her and the Beast crosses the\nroom.

The smallclothes were all silk, but <b>the gown\nitself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin</b>.\nThe points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she\nlowered her arms. And it was a woman\u2019s gown, not a little girl\u2019s, there was no\ndoubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep\nvee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts\nwere long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as\nthey laced her into it.

What\u2019s interesting is that despite those\nsimilarities there is an inversion of color, considering Beauty wears a dark\ngown and Sansa a white one, which, from the very beginning sets the tone for\nthe subversion to follow. </p><p>This subversion becomes obvious not only by examining the context of the\nSansa/Tyrion scene, but also by the reverse order in which GRRM put the\nSansa/Tyrion scenes in comparison to the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d one.</p><p>The beginning of the dialogue in the Beauty and the Beast scene goes as\nfollows:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Don\u2019t be afraid.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (<b>summoning up all her courage</b>): I \u2026 I\nwon\u2019t be afraid.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Beauty, do you mind if I watch you while\nyou dine?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You are the master.</i></p><p><i>BEAST: No, I\u2019m not. </i></p><p><i>(He pauses for a moment.) </i></p><p><i>There is no master here but you. </i></p><p><i>(He moves around to the side of the chair.)</i></p><p><b><i>I revolt you; you must find me very ugly.</i></b></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I cannot lie, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Is everything here to your liking?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I feel uneasy dressed in such finery, nor am I\nused to being waited upon.But I know you\u2019re doing your utmost to help me forget\nyour ugliness.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (walking over to the fireplace): <b>My heart\nis kind, but I am a monster.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Many men are more monstrous than you, but they\nhide it well.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Besides my ugliness, I am lacking in\nwit.</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You have wit enough to realize it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Everything in this castle is yours. Your\nevery whim will be fulfilled.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Before the dialogue begins, the Beast uses his magic to serve her some wine\n(as you can read in the introduction of the scene) and the first thing he does\nis try to soothe her fear. When she tells him she will not be afraid of him, he\nasks for her consent to watch her do something as commonplace as dine. After\nthat the Beast leads the conversation to his ugliness, about which Beauty\nrefuses to lie and then he proceeds to talk about his virtue (his kindness) and\nhis faults (his ugliness and his lack in wit). </p><p>The above dialogue was the thing that inspired the scene Sansa and Tyrion Lannister\nshare in \u201ctheir\u201d bedroom <b>after</b> their\nwedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>For their wedding night, they had been granted the use of an airy\nbedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion kicked the door shut behind\nthem. <b>\u201cThere is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard, Sansa.

She had ten thumbs\ninstead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the\nlaces and buttons, and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the\nfloor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes. Gooseprickles\ncovered her arms and legs. She kept her eyes on the floor, too shy to look at\nhim, but when she was done <b>she glanced up and found him staring.</b> There\nwas hunger in his green eye, it seemed to her, and fury in the black. Sansa did\nnot know which scared her more. </i></p><p><i>\u201cYou\u2019re a child,\u201d he said. </i></p><p><i>She covered her breasts with her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve flowered.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cA child,\u201d he repeated, <b>\u201cbut I want you.

After a\nbit of conversation unrelated to this analysis, Tyrion orders Sansa to undress.\nWhen she follows his instructions Tyrion stands there and watches her perform\nthis intimate act without asking for her consent, which comes in direct opposition\nto what the Beast did, which was ask for Beauty\u2019s consent to watch her <i>eat</i>.\n</p><p>After that, the discussion between them follows the same themes as the one\nbetween Beauty and the Beast but the vibe each of them gives off is very\ndifferent. The first thing the Beast tells Beauty is \u201cDo not be afraid\u201d to\nassure her that she is safe from him. Instead of soothing Sansa\u2019s fear though,\nthe first thing Tyrion does is to intensify it with his confession that he lusts\nafter her even though he sees she is just a child and then asks her whether\nhe\u2019s frightening her with that admission. Sansa in turn replies that she is\nindeed afraid of Tyrion, unlike Beauty, who said she would not be afraid of the\nBeast. This of course is to be expected, considering Tyrion did threaten Sansa\nwith marital rape when the Beast never threatened Beauty in any way.</p><p>The moment Sansa admits her fear would have been ideal for Tyrion to try\nand comfort her by telling her she had nothing to fear from him, but instead of\nthat, he steers the conversation away from Sansa\u2019s fear and towards himself and\nhis own \u201cfear\u201d of lusting after a child, exhibiting a rather alarming disregard\nof Sansa\u2019s feelings.</p><p>After that, Tyrion starts talking about his appearance, stating, like the\nBeast, that he knows that Sansa finds him ugly. Beauty replied that she could\nnot lie to the Beast about it, but Sansa, already terrified, does try to lie to\nTyrion, in order to protect herself from his impending (as far as she knows)\nwrath. Tyrion then goes on to talk about his fault (his ugliness) and his\nvirtues (his generosity, his bravery, his cleverness and his kindness). </p><p>At first glance, his little speech resembles the one the Beast makes, but\non closer inspection they prove to be opposites, because the Beast focuses on\nhis faults, offering only one virtue, when Tyrion focuses on his virtues,\ngiving Sansa only one fault. In essence, the Beast was selling himself short,\nmaking no attempts to endear himself to Beauty before asking her to marry him,\nwhen on the other hand Tyrion was overselling himself, trying to become more\ndesirable in her eyes to convince her to have sex with him.</p><p>This is a very important part of the subversion, because, as has already\nbeen analyzed in the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta series, in the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d\nadaptations that follow the themes of Villenueve\u2019s original one (like\nCocteau\u2019s), Beauty must know exactly what she\u2019s getting herself into before\nagreeing to marry the Beast. That means that the Beast (or in other cases\nBeauty\u2019s father) must lay all his cards on the table and not try to endear\nhimself to Beauty through pretty words. </p><p>Tyrion though, not only tries to make himself appear more desirable in her\neyes through that little speech, but also gives it to Sansa <b>after</b> the\nmarriage proposal and not before, like the Beast is supposed to. This inverse\norder, as mentioned above, ties into the subversion too, as it is meant to\nshowcase how Tyrion is the Beast\u2019s foil that does everything backwards. </p><p>As mentioned above, after the Beast talks about himself to Belle, he asks\nher to marry him. We can see that in the rest of the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d dinner\nscene cited below:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST (walking back to the dining table): I shall\nappear every evening at seven. <b>Before leaving I shall ask you a question</b>;\nit will always be the same one.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: What is your question?</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty, will you be my wife?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>No, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Farewell then</b>, Beauty. Until\ntomorrow. </i></p><p><i>He leaves the room.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The ending of the scene is very straightforward. The Beast informs Beauty\nthat he will be asking her a question every day. That question is whether\nBeauty will be his wife. When she tells him no, he respects her answer and\nleaves, promising to ask again the next day. </p><p>This sequence I believe is meant to be juxtaposed with the one right before\nSansa and Tyrion\u2019s wedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>His face darkened. \u201cI am. I\u2019m your father, and I can marry you to whoever I\nlike. To anyone.

But the gash across his face was raw and red, and his\nnose was a hideous scab. \u201cYou are very beautiful, Sansa,\u201d he told her. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is good of you to say so, my lord.\u201d She did not know what else to say.\nShould I tell him he is handsome?

I want Willas, I want Highgarden and the puppies and the barge, and sons\nnamed Eddard and Bran and Rickon. But then she remembered what Dontos had told\nher in the godswood.

On one hand we have Sansa\nbeing escorted to the Sept at sword-point and Tyrion recognizing that he should\nhave handled the \u201cproposal\u201d differently. On the other hand we have Beauty\nshowing up for dinner (not the actual wedding) on her own volition, with no\nthreats or coercion involved and the Beast proposing to her, but in no way\nimposing this marriage on her by making the decision for her, or presenting it\nto her as a fait accompli, the way Tyrion did.</p><p>Furthermore, when the Beast proposed, he fully expected Beauty\u2019s refusal\nand he was prepared\u00a0to respect her decision and try again the next day.\nWhen Sansa spoke against this marriage in front of Tyrion though, in the very\nbeginning of the scene, he didn\u2019t stop the ceremony, nor did he resolve to try\nagain the day after. On the contrary, he tried to coerce Sansa into marrying\nhim right on that instant, basically telling her she was getting married to a\nLannister that day one way or another. </p><p>Some would say that Tyrion did offer Sansa a way out, but did he really?\nConsidering the talk Tyrion had with his father and uncle before the wedding, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=but+consummate+kevan&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">Lancel was not an\noption</a> and all that speculation between Tywin and Kevan on\nwho would become Sansa\u2019s husband instead of him <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=+byplay+for+his+benefit&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">was\njust a byplay for his benefit</a> and <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=you+will+marry+Sansa+stark+and+soon&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">not\nactual options</a>. Even if it was an actual choice, Sansa would still\nhave had to take a Lannister husband that day and she didn\u2019t want to marry any\nLannister, no matter how comely he was. So she resigned to her fate,\n\u201cconsenting\u201d to the marriage, because, obviously, saying \u201cno\u201d was not an\noption. This of course is once again juxtaposed with Belle, to whom Beast gave\nall the power and agency to decide for her fate and whose wish not to take the\nBeast as her husband was respected throughout the film.</p><p>At this point I believe it is important to note that in the original\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d fairytale the Beast didn\u2019t ask for Beauty\u2019s hand in\nmarriage, but rather for her to come into his bed:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Suddenly the Beast asked her if she would allow him to sleep with her. </i></b></p><p><i>At this unexpected request, <b>all Beauty\u2019s fears were revived</b>. She uttered a terrible shriek, and\nexclaimed, in spite of herself, \u201cOh! Heavens, I am lost!\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHave no fear,\u201d the Beast quietly replied; \u201cbut without\nfrightening yourself, answer me properly: say precisely yes or no!\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>Trembling, Beauty answered, \u201cNo, Beast.\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWell then, <b>since\nyou will not let me</b>,\u201d returned the docile creature, \u201c<b>I shall leave you</b>. Good-night,\nBeauty.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGood-night, Beast,\u201d said the <b>frightened maiden, much relieved</b>.</i></p><p><b><i>Beauty and the Beast by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villenueve (translation\nfrom french)</i></b></p></blockquote><p>GRRM seems to follow both versions simultaneously in this storyline with\nSansa and Tyrion, considering Tyrion forced Sansa both into marriage and into\nsex, stopping only at the last minute before initiating intercourse.</p><p>What is rather interesting is that it wasn\u2019t Sansa who said she wouldn\u2019t\nsleep with him, but Tyrion himself:</p><blockquote><p><i>When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her\nbreast, Sansa could not help but shudder. <b>She\nlay with her eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.</b>\nWould he touch her again?

And\nthat is because Tyrion himself doesn\u2019t present her with the option to say no;\nsomething that establishes him as a foil to the Beast. Yes, he does have a\nchange of heart at the last moment due to his crisis of conscience, but that\ndoes not negate all the things he said and did before that. And the fact that\nit is ultimately Tyrion who decides that there would be no consummation and not\nSansa, inverts the power dynamics of the original fairytale and erases the\nsovereignty of Sansa\u2019s consent.</p><p>Now, back to the comparison between Cocteau\u2019s film and ASOIAF, we see that\nthe time Sansa and Tyrion spend together as husband and wife/prisoner is cut\nshort, due to Sansa\u2019s escape from King\u2019s Landing to go to her \u201cfather\u201d\n(Littlefinger is not Sansa\u2019s real father, but he fills that role anyway). </p><p>Sansa\u2019s escape takes place during a feast she attends with Tyrion, while\nshe is dressed in a silver and purple gown and wearing her \u201camethyst\u201d hairnet.\nThis is a callback to the following scene in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d: </p><p><i>Beauty is in the great hall, walking up and down in\nfront of the fire. She is\u00a0wearing a dark velvet dress. The marble busts at\neach end of the mantlepiece turn their heads to watch her. The clock strikes\nhalf past seven. Beauty looks up at the clock and sees the Beast\u2019s reflection\nin the mirror above it. \u00a0She turns round\nas he walks across the room.</i></p><blockquote><p><i>BEAUTY: How late you are!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Thank you, Beauty, for noticing.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, I was awaiting you with great impatience,\nBeast. </i></p><p><i>She throws herself to her knees and grabs his cloak.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I must talk to you!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (shocked): Beauty! Beauty!</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (still on her knees, pleading): <b>I cannot live another day without seeing my\nfather again. Please let me go, I beg you!</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Stand up, Beauty, stand up.</i></p><p><i>He pulls her to her feet and leads her to a chair. He\nsits down beside her.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: I should be on my knees taking orders from\nyou. </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (almost in tears): <b>Let me go. I promise to return.</b> </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: And when you return, will you be my wife? </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (in despair): You\u2019re torturing me.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\nknow I\u2019m repulsive.</b> <b>But I would die\nof heartbreak if I let you go and you took advantage of your freedom never to return.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I\u2019d\ncome back in a week\u2019s time. I respect you too much to cause your death.</b></i></p><p><i>The Beast lowers his head. Beauty strokes it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (looking up at her): You coax me as though I\nwere an animal.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (gently): But you are an animal.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Your\nrequest is a very serious matter. I must think about it.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>In this scene the Beast shows up late for dinner and Beauty falls to her\nknees before him and begs him to let her go back to her father. The Beast\ndespairs at her request and tells her he will think of it and a few days later,\nhe visits her chambers and makes up his mind:</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty is lying on the bed. The Beast walks over to\nthe foot of the bed.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty,\nare you ill?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, Beast. I am. </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: What ails you?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I know my father\u2019s dying.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\ncan\u2019t bear to see you waste away.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>Send me\nhome to my father.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST:<b> If</b>\n<b>I agree, will you promise to return in a\nweek\u2019s time, to the very day?</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (smiling at him): <b>I promise.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>When he sees her sorrow at having to stay away from her dying father, he\nrelents and lets her go under the condition that she will return to him. He\nputs his faith in her, despite knowing he will die if she doesn\u2019t keep her\nword, because her wellbeing and happiness is more important to him than his\nown.</p><p>Tyrion sees Sansa\u2019s sorrow before the feast too, but instead of making him\nwant to let her go, it made him want to trap her in another castle instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Their litter had been sitting in the sun, and it was\nvery warm inside the curtains. As they lurched into motion, Tyrion reclined on\nan elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands. She is just as comely as the\nTyrell girl. Her hair was a rich autumn auburn, her eyes a deep Tully blue. <b>Grief had given her a haunted, vulnerable\nlook; if anything, it had only made her more beautiful.</b> He wanted to reach\nher, to break through the armor of her courtesy. Was that what made him speak?\nOr just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder?</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cI had been thinking that when the roads are safe again, we might\njourney to Casterly Rock.\u201d</i></b><i> Far from Joffrey and my sister.

He knew what she was\nseeing; the swollen brutish brow, the raw stump of his nose, his crooked pink\nscar and mismatched eyes. <b>Her own eyes\nwere big and blue and empty. \u201cI shall go wherever my lord husband\nwishes.\u201d</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Hear+thunder+from+below+sea+comes+in&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Tyrion VIII</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>And he was provided with a chance to let Sansa go right after that, but he\ndidn\u2019t take it, choosing to change the subject instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Lady Olenna smiled. \u201cI am pleased to say <b>I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day\nafter next.</b> I have had quite enough of this smelly city, thank you. Perhaps\nyou would like to accompany me for a little visit, whilst the men are off\nhaving their war?

Considering the circumstances though, it\nwould have been death to utter such a wish to anyone in court, much less her\nLannister husband to whom she got married against her will. Still, Tyrion had\nguessed she wanted to be free, as demonstrated in the following quotes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Lord Stark asked for his sisters</b> and his father\u2019s sword as well,\u201d\nSer Cleos reminded him.</i></p><p><i>Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark\u2019s greatsword rising\nover one shoulder. \u201cIce,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that when he makes his peace\nwith us, not before.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs you say. And his sisters?\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>Tyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as he said, \u201cUntil\nsuch time as he frees my brother Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as\nhostages.</i></b><i> How well they are treated depends on him.\u201d And if the\ngods are good, Bywater will find Arya alive, before Robb learns she\u2019s gone\nmissing.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Sansa+stab+of+pity&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\"><b>A\nClash of Kings - Tyrion VI</b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of his nose. The scar tissue itched\nabominably sometimes.<b> \u201cHis Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa\u2019s life a\nmisery since the day her father died, and now that she is finally rid of\nJoffrey you propose to marry her to me.

Oh, Mother, no, not that, they haven\u2019t\nharmed her, not that way, only\u2026 a bird came last night, but I couldn\u2019t bring\nmyself to tell you, not until your father was sent to his rest.\u201d Robb took her\nhand. <b>\u201cThey married her to Tyrion Lannister.\u201d</b></i></p><p><i>Catelyn\u2019s fingers clutched at his. \u201cThe Imp.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHe swore to trade her for his brother,\u201d</i></b><i> she said numbly.\n\u201cSansa and Arya both.

This once again is meant to accentuate how\ndifferent Tyrion is from Cocteau\u2019s Beast in that regard, putting his own fears\nbefore Sansa\u2019s needs and happiness.</p><p>Despite Tyrion not giving her his permission to leave, Sansa leaves him\nanyway. And since Tyrion is not the one to release her, she leaves with no strings\nattached. This of course means that since Tyrion never made her promise him she\nwould return, as the Beast had, Sansa never came back for him, even though she\nknew he was facing capital punishment.</p><p>This development in my opinion is GRRM\u2019s in-text critique of the Stockholm\nsyndrome usually associated with the more modernized version of the tale of\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d that has been established after the Disney film came out.\n</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty and the Beast is often accused of supporting a\n\u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d romance. In reality, it reflects what arranged marriages\nwere often like at the time, and the Beast is much kinder than husbands had to\nbe. Disney\u2019s film updates the story for a modern audience, but it does so\nproblematically. The drama of the original story was drawn from Beauty\ndiscovering that things are not always as they appear while Disney\u2019s drama is\ndrawn from Belle taming Beast.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.germmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-beauty-and-the-beast/\"><i>The\nEvolution of Beauty and the Beast</i></a></b><b></b></p></blockquote><p>As established on the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta, Sansa\u2019s arc could very well be the result of GRRM\u2019s\ngrievances with Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d adaptation, which actually has\nBelle fall in love with the Beast due to Stockholm syndrome and not because\nhe\u2019s being kind and respectful of her like in the original fairytale. </p><p>Tyrion was not as cruel as Joffrey or as vicious as the Hound, but he was a\nfoil to Cocteau\u2019s Beast nevertheless. And in order to demonstrate how Tyrion\nwas not worthy of Sansa\u2019s love, GRRM never had Sansa fall in love with him or\ncare for him enough to go back and save him, subverting the very problematic\nStockholm Syndrome romance trope Disney established.</p><p>Once more I\u2019d like to thank <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwWZHOYYX4qznCWYcc2asUw\">@kellyvela</a> who have\nmade the writing of this meta possible with their wonderful ideas and their constant\nsupport.</p>",

Tyrion is a much less obvious foil of the Beast,\nbecause both his appearance and his character align well with Cocteau\u2019s Beast\nup until ASOS, where he was still toeing the line between hero and villain.\nDespite that, after analyzing the scenes Tyrion and Sansa have together, it\nbecomes apparent that the dynamic between them is meant to be juxtaposed with\nthe one between Beauty and the Beast and not paralleled.</p><p>Since this gets rather lengthy, the rest can be read under the cut.</p>[[MORE]]<p>There is no better chapter to showcase this than the one where Sansa and\nTyrion get married, which bears a striking resemblance to the scene of the\nfirst dinner the Beast and Beauty share. Even before the actual wedding, GRRM\nestablishes a connection between the two scenes by having Sansa and Beauty\ndressed in a similar way as we see below:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the great hall the clock strikes seven. On each side of the blazing fire\nthe marble busts turn their heads. Beauty is sitting at the table, wearing a <b>dark\njeweled dress</b>, <b>with matching jewels round her neck and wound into her\nhair.</b> The hand from the candelabra on the table picks up the silver wine\ndecanter to serve her. <b>She leans back in her chair with a sigh of despair\nand closes her eyes.</b> The door opens behind her and the Beast crosses the\nroom. He stands behind her, leaning on the back of the chair.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed\nSansa in her new clothes. The smallclothes were all silk, but <b>the gown\nitself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin</b>.\nThe points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she\nlowered her arms. And it was a woman\u2019s gown, not a little girl\u2019s, there was no\ndoubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep\nvee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts\nwere long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as\nthey laced her into it. They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft\ngrey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers. </i></p><p><i>[\u2026]</i></p><p><i>Queen Cersei studied her critically. \u201cA few gems, I think.

What\u2019s interesting is that despite those\nsimilarities there is an inversion of color, considering Beauty wears a dark\ngown and Sansa a white one, which, from the very beginning sets the tone for\nthe subversion to follow. </p><p>This subversion becomes obvious not only by examining the context of the\nSansa/Tyrion scene, but also by the reverse order in which GRRM put the\nSansa/Tyrion scenes in comparison to the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d one.</p><p>The beginning of the dialogue in the Beauty and the Beast scene goes as\nfollows:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Don\u2019t be afraid.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (<b>summoning up all her courage</b>): I \u2026 I\nwon\u2019t be afraid.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Beauty, do you mind if I watch you while\nyou dine?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You are the master.</i></p><p><i>BEAST: No, I\u2019m not. </i></p><p><i>(He pauses for a moment.) </i></p><p><i>There is no master here but you. </i></p><p><i>(He moves around to the side of the chair.)</i></p><p><b><i>I revolt you; you must find me very ugly.</i></b></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I cannot lie, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Is everything here to your liking?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I feel uneasy dressed in such finery, nor am I\nused to being waited upon.But I know you\u2019re doing your utmost to help me forget\nyour ugliness.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (walking over to the fireplace): <b>My heart\nis kind, but I am a monster.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Many men are more monstrous than you, but they\nhide it well.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Besides my ugliness, I am lacking in\nwit.</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You have wit enough to realize it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Everything in this castle is yours. Your\nevery whim will be fulfilled.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Before the dialogue begins, the Beast uses his magic to serve her some wine\n(as you can read in the introduction of the scene) and the first thing he does\nis try to soothe her fear. When she tells him she will not be afraid of him, he\nasks for her consent to watch her do something as commonplace as dine. After\nthat the Beast leads the conversation to his ugliness, about which Beauty\nrefuses to lie and then he proceeds to talk about his virtue (his kindness) and\nhis faults (his ugliness and his lack in wit). </p><p>The above dialogue was the thing that inspired the scene Sansa and Tyrion Lannister\nshare in \u201ctheir\u201d bedroom <b>after</b> their\nwedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>For their wedding night, they had been granted the use of an airy\nbedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand.

After a\nbit of conversation unrelated to this analysis, Tyrion orders Sansa to undress.\nWhen she follows his instructions Tyrion stands there and watches her perform\nthis intimate act without asking for her consent, which comes in direct opposition\nto what the Beast did, which was ask for Beauty\u2019s consent to watch her <i>eat</i>.\n</p><p>After that, the discussion between them follows the same themes as the one\nbetween Beauty and the Beast but the vibe each of them gives off is very\ndifferent. The first thing the Beast tells Beauty is \u201cDo not be afraid\u201d to\nassure her that she is safe from him. Instead of soothing Sansa\u2019s fear though,\nthe first thing Tyrion does is to intensify it with his confession that he lusts\nafter her even though he sees she is just a child and then asks her whether\nhe\u2019s frightening her with that admission. Sansa in turn replies that she is\nindeed afraid of Tyrion, unlike Beauty, who said she would not be afraid of the\nBeast. This of course is to be expected, considering Tyrion did threaten Sansa\nwith marital rape when the Beast never threatened Beauty in any way.</p><p>The moment Sansa admits her fear would have been ideal for Tyrion to try\nand comfort her by telling her she had nothing to fear from him, but instead of\nthat, he steers the conversation away from Sansa\u2019s fear and towards himself and\nhis own \u201cfear\u201d of lusting after a child, exhibiting a rather alarming disregard\nof Sansa\u2019s feelings.</p><p>After that, Tyrion starts talking about his appearance, stating, like the\nBeast, that he knows that Sansa finds him ugly. Beauty replied that she could\nnot lie to the Beast about it, but Sansa, already terrified, does try to lie to\nTyrion, in order to protect herself from his impending (as far as she knows)\nwrath. Tyrion then goes on to talk about his fault (his ugliness) and his\nvirtues (his generosity, his bravery, his cleverness and his kindness). </p><p>At first glance, his little speech resembles the one the Beast makes, but\non closer inspection they prove to be opposites, because the Beast focuses on\nhis faults, offering only one virtue, when Tyrion focuses on his virtues,\ngiving Sansa only one fault. In essence, the Beast was selling himself short,\nmaking no attempts to endear himself to Beauty before asking her to marry him,\nwhen on the other hand Tyrion was overselling himself, trying to become more\ndesirable in her eyes to convince her to have sex with him.</p><p>This is a very important part of the subversion, because, as has already\nbeen analyzed in the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta series, in the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d\nadaptations that follow the themes of Villenueve\u2019s original one (like\nCocteau\u2019s), Beauty must know exactly what she\u2019s getting herself into before\nagreeing to marry the Beast. That means that the Beast (or in other cases\nBeauty\u2019s father) must lay all his cards on the table and not try to endear\nhimself to Beauty through pretty words. </p><p>Tyrion though, not only tries to make himself appear more desirable in her\neyes through that little speech, but also gives it to Sansa <b>after</b> the\nmarriage proposal and not before, like the Beast is supposed to. This inverse\norder, as mentioned above, ties into the subversion too, as it is meant to\nshowcase how Tyrion is the Beast\u2019s foil that does everything backwards. </p><p>As mentioned above, after the Beast talks about himself to Belle, he asks\nher to marry him. We can see that in the rest of the \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d dinner\nscene cited below:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST (walking back to the dining table): I shall\nappear every evening at seven. <b>Before leaving I shall ask you a question</b>;\nit will always be the same one.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: What is your question?</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty, will you be my wife?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>No, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Farewell then</b>, Beauty. Until\ntomorrow. </i></p><p><i>He leaves the room.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B\u00eate (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The ending of the scene is very straightforward. The Beast informs Beauty\nthat he will be asking her a question every day. That question is whether\nBeauty will be his wife. When she tells him no, he respects her answer and\nleaves, promising to ask again the next day. </p><p>This sequence I believe is meant to be juxtaposed with the one right before\nSansa and Tyrion\u2019s wedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>His face darkened. \u201cI am. I\u2019m your father, and I can marry you to whoever I\nlike. To anyone.

But the gash across his face was raw and red, and his\nnose was a hideous scab. \u201cYou are very beautiful, Sansa,\u201d he told her. </i></p><p><i>\u201cIt is good of you to say so, my lord.\u201d She did not know what else to say.\nShould I tell him he is handsome?

And for making this <b>so sudden, and so secret</b>. My lord father\nfelt it necessary, for reasons of state.

I want Willas, I want Highgarden and the puppies and the barge, and sons\nnamed Eddard and Bran and Rickon. But then she remembered what Dontos had told\nher in the godswood.

On one hand we have Sansa\nbeing escorted to the Sept at sword-point and Tyrion recognizing that he should\nhave handled the \u201cproposal\u201d differently. On the other hand we have Beauty\nshowing up for dinner (not the actual wedding) on her own volition, with no\nthreats or coercion involved and the Beast proposing to her, but in no way\nimposing this marriage on her by making the decision for her, or presenting it\nto her as a fait accompli, the way Tyrion did.</p><p>Furthermore, when the Beast proposed, he fully expected Beauty\u2019s refusal\nand he was prepared\u00a0to respect her decision and try again the next day.\nWhen Sansa spoke against this marriage in front of Tyrion though, in the very\nbeginning of the scene, he didn\u2019t stop the ceremony, nor did he resolve to try\nagain the day after. On the contrary, he tried to coerce Sansa into marrying\nhim right on that instant, basically telling her she was getting married to a\nLannister that day one way or another. </p><p>Some would say that Tyrion did offer Sansa a way out, but did he really?\nConsidering the talk Tyrion had with his father and uncle before the wedding, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=but+consummate+kevan&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">Lancel was not an\noption</a> and all that speculation between Tywin and Kevan on\nwho would become Sansa\u2019s husband instead of him <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=+byplay+for+his+benefit&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">was\njust a byplay for his benefit</a> and <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=you+will+marry+Sansa+stark+and+soon&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">not\nactual options</a>. Even if it was an actual choice, Sansa would still\nhave had to take a Lannister husband that day and she didn\u2019t want to marry any\nLannister, no matter how comely he was. So she resigned to her fate,\n\u201cconsenting\u201d to the marriage, because, obviously, saying \u201cno\u201d was not an\noption. This of course is once again juxtaposed with Belle, to whom Beast gave\nall the power and agency to decide for her fate and whose wish not to take the\nBeast as her husband was respected throughout the film.</p><p>At this point I believe it is important to note that in the original\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d fairytale the Beast didn\u2019t ask for Beauty\u2019s hand in\nmarriage, but rather for her to come into his bed:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Suddenly the Beast asked her if she would allow him to sleep with her. </i></b></p><p><i>At this unexpected request, <b>all Beauty\u2019s fears were revived</b>. She uttered a terrible shriek, and\nexclaimed, in spite of herself, \u201cOh! Heavens, I am lost!\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>\u201cHave no fear,\u201d the Beast quietly replied; \u201cbut without\nfrightening yourself, answer me properly: say precisely yes or no!\u201d </i></b></p><p><b><i>Trembling, Beauty answered, \u201cNo, Beast.\u201d </i></b></p><p><i>\u201cWell then, <b>since\nyou will not let me</b>,\u201d returned the docile creature, \u201c<b>I shall leave you</b>. Good-night,\nBeauty.\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cGood-night, Beast,\u201d said the <b>frightened maiden, much relieved</b>.</i></p><p><b><i>Beauty and the Beast by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villenueve (translation\nfrom french)</i></b></p></blockquote><p>GRRM seems to follow both versions simultaneously in this storyline with\nSansa and Tyrion, considering Tyrion forced Sansa both into marriage and into\nsex, stopping only at the last minute before initiating intercourse.</p><p>What is rather interesting is that it wasn\u2019t Sansa who said she wouldn\u2019t\nsleep with him, but Tyrion himself:</p><blockquote><p><i>When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her\nbreast, Sansa could not help but shudder. <b>She\nlay with her eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.</b>\nWould he touch her again? Kiss her? Should she open her legs for him now? She\ndid not know what was expected of her.</i></p><p><i>\u201cSansa.\u201d The hand was gone. \u201cOpen your\neyes.\u201d</i></p><p><b><i>She had promised to obey</i></b><i>; she opened her eyes. He was sitting by her feet, naked.

And\nthat is because Tyrion himself doesn\u2019t present her with the option to say no;\nsomething that establishes him as a foil to the Beast. Yes, he does have a\nchange of heart at the last moment due to his crisis of conscience, but that\ndoes not negate all the things he said and did before that. And the fact that\nit is ultimately Tyrion who decides that there would be no consummation and not\nSansa, inverts the power dynamics of the original fairytale and erases the\nsovereignty of Sansa\u2019s consent.</p><p>Now, back to the comparison between Cocteau\u2019s film and ASOIAF, we see that\nthe time Sansa and Tyrion spend together as husband and wife/prisoner is cut\nshort, due to Sansa\u2019s escape from King\u2019s Landing to go to her \u201cfather\u201d\n(Littlefinger is not Sansa\u2019s real father, but he fills that role anyway). </p><p>Sansa\u2019s escape takes place during a feast she attends with Tyrion, while\nshe is dressed in a silver and purple gown and wearing her \u201camethyst\u201d hairnet.\nThis is a callback to the following scene in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d: </p><p><i>Beauty is in the great hall, walking up and down in\nfront of the fire. She is\u00a0wearing a dark velvet dress. The marble busts at\neach end of the mantlepiece turn their heads to watch her. The clock strikes\nhalf past seven. Beauty looks up at the clock and sees the Beast\u2019s reflection\nin the mirror above it. \u00a0She turns round\nas he walks across the room.</i></p><blockquote><p><i>BEAUTY: How late you are!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Thank you, Beauty, for noticing.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, I was awaiting you with great impatience,\nBeast. </i></p><p><i>She throws herself to her knees and grabs his cloak.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I must talk to you!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (shocked): Beauty!

The Beast\ndespairs at her request and tells her he will think of it and a few days later,\nhe visits her chambers and makes up his mind:</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty is lying on the bed. The Beast walks over to\nthe foot of the bed.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty,\nare you ill?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, Beast.

He\nputs his faith in her, despite knowing he will die if she doesn\u2019t keep her\nword, because her wellbeing and happiness is more important to him than his\nown.</p><p>Tyrion sees Sansa\u2019s sorrow before the feast too, but instead of making him\nwant to let her go, it made him want to trap her in another castle instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Their litter had been sitting in the sun, and it was\nvery warm inside the curtains.

Considering the circumstances though, it\nwould have been death to utter such a wish to anyone in court, much less her\nLannister husband to whom she got married against her will. Still, Tyrion had\nguessed she wanted to be free, as demonstrated in the following quotes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201c<b>Lord Stark asked for his sisters</b> and his father\u2019s sword as well,\u201d\nSer Cleos reminded him.</i></p><p><i>Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark\u2019s greatsword rising\nover one shoulder. \u201cIce,\u201d said Tyrion. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that when he makes his peace\nwith us, not before.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cAs you say.

This once again is meant to accentuate how\ndifferent Tyrion is from Cocteau\u2019s Beast in that regard, putting his own fears\nbefore Sansa\u2019s needs and happiness.</p><p>Despite Tyrion not giving her his permission to leave, Sansa leaves him\nanyway. And since Tyrion is not the one to release her, she leaves with no strings\nattached. This of course means that since Tyrion never made her promise him she\nwould return, as the Beast had, Sansa never came back for him, even though she\nknew he was facing capital punishment.</p><p>This development in my opinion is GRRM\u2019s in-text critique of the Stockholm\nsyndrome usually associated with the more modernized version of the tale of\n\u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d that has been established after the Disney film came out.\n</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty and the Beast is often accused of supporting a\n\u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d romance. In reality, it reflects what arranged marriages\nwere often like at the time, and the Beast is much kinder than husbands had to\nbe. Disney\u2019s film updates the story for a modern audience, but it does so\nproblematically. The drama of the original story was drawn from Beauty\ndiscovering that things are not always as they appear while Disney\u2019s drama is\ndrawn from Belle taming Beast.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.germmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-beauty-and-the-beast/\"><i>The\nEvolution of Beauty and the Beast</i></a></b><b></b></p></blockquote><p>As established on the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta, Sansa\u2019s arc could very well be the result of GRRM\u2019s\ngrievances with Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d adaptation, which actually has\nBelle fall in love with the Beast due to Stockholm syndrome and not because\nhe\u2019s being kind and respectful of her like in the original fairytale. </p><p>Tyrion was not as cruel as Joffrey or as vicious as the Hound, but he was a\nfoil to Cocteau\u2019s Beast nevertheless. And in order to demonstrate how Tyrion\nwas not worthy of Sansa\u2019s love, GRRM never had Sansa fall in love with him or\ncare for him enough to go back and save him, subverting the very problematic\nStockholm Syndrome romance trope Disney established.</p><p>Once more I\u2019d like to thank <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwWZHOYYX4qznCWYcc2asUw\">@kellyvela</a> who have\nmade the writing of this meta possible with their wonderful ideas and their constant\nsupport.</p>",

Tyrion is a much less obvious foil of the Beast,\nbecause both his appearance and his character align well with Cocteau&rsquo;s Beast\nup until ASOS, where he was still toeing the line between hero and villain.\nDespite that, after analyzing the scenes Tyrion and Sansa have together, it\nbecomes apparent that the dynamic between them is meant to be juxtaposed with\nthe one between Beauty and the Beast and not paralleled.</p><p>Since this gets rather lengthy, the rest can be read under the cut.</p><p>There is no better chapter to showcase this than the one where Sansa and\nTyrion get married, which bears a striking resemblance to the scene of the\nfirst dinner the Beast and Beauty share. Even before the actual wedding, GRRM\nestablishes a connection between the two scenes by having Sansa and Beauty\ndressed in a similar way as we see below:</p><blockquote><p><i>In the great hall the clock strikes seven. On each side of the blazing fire\nthe marble busts turn their heads. Beauty is sitting at the table, wearing a <b>dark\njeweled dress</b>, <b>with matching jewels round her neck and wound into her\nhair.</b> The hand from the candelabra on the table picks up the silver wine\ndecanter to serve her. <b>She leans back in her chair with a sigh of despair\nand closes her eyes.</b> The door opens behind her and the Beast crosses the\nroom. He stands behind her, leaning on the back of the chair.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B&ecirc;te (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Cersei herself arrived with the seamstress, and watched as they dressed\nSansa in her new clothes. The smallclothes were all silk, but <b>the gown\nitself was ivory samite and cloth-of-silver, and lined with silvery satin</b>.\nThe points of the long dagged sleeves almost touched the ground when she\nlowered her arms. And it was a woman&rsquo;s gown, not a little girl&rsquo;s, there was no\ndoubt of that. The bodice was slashed in front almost to her belly, the deep\nvee covered over with a panel of ornate Myrish lace in dove-grey. The skirts\nwere long and full, the waist so tight that Sansa had to hold her breath as\nthey laced her into it. They brought her new shoes as well, slippers of soft\ngrey doeskin that hugged her feet like lovers. </i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>Queen Cersei studied her critically. &ldquo;A few gems, I think. The moonstones\nJoffrey gave her.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;At once, Your Grace,&rdquo; her maid replied. </i></p><p><b><i>When the moonstones hung from Sansa&rsquo;s ears and about her neck,</i></b><i> the queen nodded.</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;The cloak,&rdquo; she commanded, and the women brought it out: <b>a long cloak\nof white velvet heavy with pearls.</b> A fierce direwolf was embroidered upon\nit in silver thread. Sansa looked at it with sudden dread. &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s\ncolors,&rdquo; said Cersei, as they fastened it about her neck with a slender silver\nchain.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=moonstones+hung+Sansa%27s+ears&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Sansa\"><b>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</b></a></p></blockquote><p>Both Sansa and Beauty are dressed in jeweled dresses and wear a necklace\nand a hairnet that matches the outfit. What&rsquo;s interesting is that despite those\nsimilarities there is an inversion of color, considering Beauty wears a dark\ngown and Sansa a white one, which, from the very beginning sets the tone for\nthe subversion to follow. </p><p>This subversion becomes obvious not only by examining the context of the\nSansa/Tyrion scene, but also by the reverse order in which GRRM put the\nSansa/Tyrion scenes in comparison to the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; one.</p><p>The beginning of the dialogue in the Beauty and the Beast scene goes as\nfollows:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Don&rsquo;t be afraid.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (<b>summoning up all her courage</b>): I &hellip; I\nwon&rsquo;t be afraid.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Beauty, do you mind if I watch you while\nyou dine?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You are the master.</i></p><p><i>BEAST: No, I&rsquo;m not. </i></p><p><i>(He pauses for a moment.) </i></p><p><i>There is no master here but you. </i></p><p><i>(He moves around to the side of the chair.)</i></p><p><b><i>I revolt you; you must find me very ugly.</i></b></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I cannot lie, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Is everything here to your liking?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I feel uneasy dressed in such finery, nor am I\nused to being waited upon.But I know you&rsquo;re doing your utmost to help me forget\nyour ugliness.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (walking over to the fireplace): <b>My heart\nis kind, but I am a monster.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Many men are more monstrous than you, but they\nhide it well.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Besides my ugliness, I am lacking in\nwit.</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: You have wit enough to realize it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Everything in this castle is yours. Your\nevery whim will be fulfilled.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B&ecirc;te (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Before the dialogue begins, the Beast uses his magic to serve her some wine\n(as you can read in the introduction of the scene) and the first thing he does\nis try to soothe her fear. When she tells him she will not be afraid of him, he\nasks for her consent to watch her do something as commonplace as dine. After\nthat the Beast leads the conversation to his ugliness, about which Beauty\nrefuses to lie and then he proceeds to talk about his virtue (his kindness) and\nhis faults (his ugliness and his lack in wit). </p><p>The above dialogue was the thing that inspired the scene Sansa and Tyrion Lannister\nshare in &ldquo;their&rdquo; bedroom <b>after</b> their\nwedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>For their wedding night, they had been granted the use of an airy\nbedchamber high in the Tower of the Hand. Tyrion kicked the door shut behind\nthem. <b>&ldquo;There is a flagon of good Arbor gold on the sideboard, Sansa. Will\nyou be so kind as to pour me a cup?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I am your husband. You can take off your armor now.&rdquo;</i></b><i> </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;And my clothing?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;That too.&rdquo; He waved his wine cup at her. &ldquo;My lord father has commanded me\nto consummate this marriage.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her hands trembled as she began fumbling at her clothes. She had ten thumbs\ninstead of fingers, and all of them were broken. Yet somehow she managed the\nlaces and buttons, and her cloak and gown and girdle and undersilk slid to the\nfloor, until finally she was stepping out of her smallclothes. Gooseprickles\ncovered her arms and legs. She kept her eyes on the floor, too shy to look at\nhim, but when she was done <b>she glanced up and found him staring.</b> There\nwas hunger in his green eye, it seemed to her, and fury in the black. Sansa did\nnot know which scared her more. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a child,&rdquo; he said. </i></p><p><i>She covered her breasts with her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve flowered.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A child,&rdquo; he repeated, <b>&ldquo;but I want you. Does that frighten you, Sansa?</b>&rdquo;\n</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Me as well. <b>I know I am ugly</b> - </i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;No, my -if </i></b></p><p><i>He pushed himself to his feet. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie, Sansa. <b>I am malformed,\nscarred, and small,</b> but&hellip;&rdquo; she could see him groping &ldquo;&hellip; abed, when the\ncandles are blown out, <b>I am made no\nworse than other men</b>. In the dark, I am the Knight of Flowers.&rdquo; He took a\ndraught of wine. &ldquo;<b>I am generous. Loyal\nto those who are loyal to me. I&rsquo;ve proven I&rsquo;m no craven.</b> <b>And I am\ncleverer than most, surely wits count for something.</b> <b>I can even be kind.\n</b>Kindness is not a habit with us Lannisters, I fear, but I know I have some\nsomewhere. I could be&hellip; <b>I could be good\nto you.</b>&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>When he finally realized that she had no answer for him, Tyrion Lannister\ndrained the last of his wine. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said bitterly. <b>&ldquo;Get in the\nbed, Sansa.</b> We need to do our duty.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She climbed onto the featherbed, conscious of his stare. A scented beeswax\ncandle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had been strewn between the\nsheets. <b>She had started to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard\nhim say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>The cold made her shiver, but she obeyed.</i></b></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;On my honor as a Lannister,&rdquo; the Imp said, <b>&ldquo;I will not touch you until\nyou want me to.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>It took all the courage that was in her to look in those mismatched eyes\nand say, <b>&ldquo;And if I never want you to, my lord?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>His mouth jerked as if she had slapped him. &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her neck was so tight <b>she could scarcely nod.</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is why the gods made whores for imps like me.&rdquo; He\nclosed his short blunt fingers into a fist, and climbed down off the bed.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=I+could+be+good+to+you+kind&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Sansa\"><b><i>A Storm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The subversive tone set up earlier, while Sansa was dressing for the\nwedding continues the bedroom scene, by having Tyrion ask Sansa to pour him the\nwine instead of serving her himself like the Beast did using his magic. After a\nbit of conversation unrelated to this analysis, Tyrion orders Sansa to undress.\nWhen she follows his instructions Tyrion stands there and watches her perform\nthis intimate act without asking for her consent, which comes in direct opposition\nto what the Beast did, which was ask for Beauty&rsquo;s consent to watch her <i>eat</i>.\n</p><p>After that, the discussion between them follows the same themes as the one\nbetween Beauty and the Beast but the vibe each of them gives off is very\ndifferent. The first thing the Beast tells Beauty is &ldquo;Do not be afraid&rdquo; to\nassure her that she is safe from him. Instead of soothing Sansa&rsquo;s fear though,\nthe first thing Tyrion does is to intensify it with his confession that he lusts\nafter her even though he sees she is just a child and then asks her whether\nhe&rsquo;s frightening her with that admission. Sansa in turn replies that she is\nindeed afraid of Tyrion, unlike Beauty, who said she would not be afraid of the\nBeast. This of course is to be expected, considering Tyrion did threaten Sansa\nwith marital rape when the Beast never threatened Beauty in any way.</p><p>The moment Sansa admits her fear would have been ideal for Tyrion to try\nand comfort her by telling her she had nothing to fear from him, but instead of\nthat, he steers the conversation away from Sansa&rsquo;s fear and towards himself and\nhis own &ldquo;fear&rdquo; of lusting after a child, exhibiting a rather alarming disregard\nof Sansa&rsquo;s feelings.</p><p>After that, Tyrion starts talking about his appearance, stating, like the\nBeast, that he knows that Sansa finds him ugly. Beauty replied that she could\nnot lie to the Beast about it, but Sansa, already terrified, does try to lie to\nTyrion, in order to protect herself from his impending (as far as she knows)\nwrath. Tyrion then goes on to talk about his fault (his ugliness) and his\nvirtues (his generosity, his bravery, his cleverness and his kindness). </p><p>At first glance, his little speech resembles the one the Beast makes, but\non closer inspection they prove to be opposites, because the Beast focuses on\nhis faults, offering only one virtue, when Tyrion focuses on his virtues,\ngiving Sansa only one fault. In essence, the Beast was selling himself short,\nmaking no attempts to endear himself to Beauty before asking her to marry him,\nwhen on the other hand Tyrion was overselling himself, trying to become more\ndesirable in her eyes to convince her to have sex with him.</p><p>This is a very important part of the subversion, because, as has already\nbeen analyzed in the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta series, in the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo;\nadaptations that follow the themes of Villenueve&rsquo;s original one (like\nCocteau&rsquo;s), Beauty must know exactly what she&rsquo;s getting herself into before\nagreeing to marry the Beast. That means that the Beast (or in other cases\nBeauty&rsquo;s father) must lay all his cards on the table and not try to endear\nhimself to Beauty through pretty words. </p><p>Tyrion though, not only tries to make himself appear more desirable in her\neyes through that little speech, but also gives it to Sansa <b>after</b> the\nmarriage proposal and not before, like the Beast is supposed to. This inverse\norder, as mentioned above, ties into the subversion too, as it is meant to\nshowcase how Tyrion is the Beast&rsquo;s foil that does everything backwards. </p><p>As mentioned above, after the Beast talks about himself to Belle, he asks\nher to marry him. We can see that in the rest of the &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; dinner\nscene cited below:</p><blockquote><p><i>THE BEAST (walking back to the dining table): I shall\nappear every evening at seven. <b>Before leaving I shall ask you a question</b>;\nit will always be the same one.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: What is your question?</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty, will you be my wife?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>No, Beast.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Farewell then</b>, Beauty. Until\ntomorrow. </i></p><p><i>He leaves the room.</i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B&ecirc;te (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The ending of the scene is very straightforward. The Beast informs Beauty\nthat he will be asking her a question every day. That question is whether\nBeauty will be his wife. When she tells him no, he respects her answer and\nleaves, promising to ask again the next day. </p><p>This sequence I believe is meant to be juxtaposed with the one right before\nSansa and Tyrion&rsquo;s wedding:</p><blockquote><p><i>His face darkened. &ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;m your father, and I can marry you to whoever I\nlike. To anyone. You&rsquo;ll marry the pig boy if I say so, and bed down with him in\nthe sty.&rdquo; His green eyes glittered with amusement. &ldquo;Or maybe I should give you\nto Ilyn Payne, would you like him better?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>Her heart lurched. &ldquo;Please, Your Grace,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;If you ever loved me\neven a little bit, <b>don&rsquo;t make me marry your&minus;&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;&minus;uncle?&rdquo;Tyrion wore a doublet of black velvet covered with golden\nscrollwork, thigh-high boots that added three inches to his height, a chain of\nrubies and lions&rsquo; heads. But the gash across his face was raw and red, and his\nnose was a hideous scab. &ldquo;You are very beautiful, Sansa,&rdquo; he told her. </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;It is good of you to say so, my lord.&rdquo; She did not know what else to say.\nShould I tell him he is handsome? He&rsquo;ll think me a fool or a liar. She lowered\nher gaze and held her tongue.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;<b>My lady, this is no way to bring you to your wedding</b>. I am sorry\nfor that. And for making this <b>so sudden, and so secret</b>. My lord father\nfelt it necessary, for reasons of state.

On one hand we have Sansa\nbeing escorted to the Sept at sword-point and Tyrion recognizing that he should\nhave handled the &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; differently. On the other hand we have Beauty\nshowing up for dinner (not the actual wedding) on her own volition, with no\nthreats or coercion involved and the Beast proposing to her, but in no way\nimposing this marriage on her by making the decision for her, or presenting it\nto her as a fait accompli, the way Tyrion did.</p><p>Furthermore, when the Beast proposed, he fully expected Beauty&rsquo;s refusal\nand he was prepared&nbsp;to respect her decision and try again the next day.\nWhen Sansa spoke against this marriage in front of Tyrion though, in the very\nbeginning of the scene, he didn&rsquo;t stop the ceremony, nor did he resolve to try\nagain the day after. On the contrary, he tried to coerce Sansa into marrying\nhim right on that instant, basically telling her she was getting married to a\nLannister that day one way or another. </p><p>Some would say that Tyrion did offer Sansa a way out, but did he really?\nConsidering the talk Tyrion had with his father and uncle before the wedding, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=but+consummate+kevan&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">Lancel was not an\noption</a> and all that speculation between Tywin and Kevan on\nwho would become Sansa&rsquo;s husband instead of him <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=+byplay+for+his+benefit&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">was\njust a byplay for his benefit</a> and <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=you+will+marry+Sansa+stark+and+soon&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\">not\nactual options</a>. Even if it was an actual choice, Sansa would still\nhave had to take a Lannister husband that day and she didn&rsquo;t want to marry any\nLannister, no matter how comely he was. So she resigned to her fate,\n&ldquo;consenting&rdquo; to the marriage, because, obviously, saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; was not an\noption. This of course is once again juxtaposed with Belle, to whom Beast gave\nall the power and agency to decide for her fate and whose wish not to take the\nBeast as her husband was respected throughout the film.</p><p>At this point I believe it is important to note that in the original\n&ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; fairytale the Beast didn&rsquo;t ask for Beauty&rsquo;s hand in\nmarriage, but rather for her to come into his bed:</p><blockquote><p><b><i>Suddenly the Beast asked her if she would allow him to sleep with her. </i></b></p><p><i>At this unexpected request, <b>all Beauty&rsquo;s fears were revived</b>. She uttered a terrible shriek, and\nexclaimed, in spite of herself, &ldquo;Oh! Heavens, I am lost!&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; the Beast quietly replied; &ldquo;but without\nfrightening yourself, answer me properly: say precisely yes or no!&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><b><i>Trembling, Beauty answered, &ldquo;No, Beast.&rdquo; </i></b></p><p><i>&ldquo;Well then, <b>since\nyou will not let me</b>,&rdquo; returned the docile creature, &ldquo;<b>I shall leave you</b>. Good-night,\nBeauty.&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Good-night, Beast,&rdquo; said the <b>frightened maiden, much relieved</b>.</i></p><p><b><i>Beauty and the Beast by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villenueve (translation\nfrom french)</i></b></p></blockquote><p>GRRM seems to follow both versions simultaneously in this storyline with\nSansa and Tyrion, considering Tyrion forced Sansa both into marriage and into\nsex, stopping only at the last minute before initiating intercourse.</p><p>What is rather interesting is that it wasn&rsquo;t Sansa who said she wouldn&rsquo;t\nsleep with him, but Tyrion himself:</p><blockquote><p><i>When he hopped up on the bed and put his hand on her\nbreast, Sansa could not help but shudder. <b>She\nlay with her eyes closed, every muscle tense, dreading what might come next.</b>\nWould he touch her again? Kiss her? Should she open her legs for him now? She\ndid not know what was expected of her.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Sansa.&rdquo; The hand was gone. &ldquo;Open your\neyes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>She had promised to obey</i></b><i>; she opened her eyes. He was sitting by her feet, naked. Where his legs\njoined, his man&rsquo;s staff poked up stiff and hard from a thicket of coarse yellow\nhair, but it was the only thing about him that was straight.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; Tyrion said, &ldquo;<b>you are lovely, make no mistake, but&hellip; I\ncannot do this</b>. My father be damned. <b>We\nwill wait</b>. The turn of a moon, a year, a season, however long it takes.\nUntil you have come to know me better, and perhaps to trust me a little.&rdquo;\nHis smile might have been meant to be reassuring, but without a nose it only\nmade him look more grotesque and sinister.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=She+had+promised+to+obey+opened+eyes&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>Sansa&rsquo;s obedience despite her lack of consent is to be attributed to the\nfact that Tyrion himself had already made it more than clear that she had no\nsay in the matter:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the Imp confessed, &ldquo;but not so\ndrunk that I cannot attend to my own bedding.&rdquo; He hopped down from the\ndais and <b>grabbed Sansa roughly.\n&ldquo;Come, wife, time to smash your portcullis. I want to play come-into-the-castle.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Red-faced, Sansa went with him from the Small Hall. <b>What choice do I have?</b> Tyrion waddled\nwhen he walked, especially when he walked as quickly as he did now. The gods\nwere merciful, and neither Joffrey nor any of the others moved to follow.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Play+come+into+my+castle+portcullis&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b><i>&ldquo;I am your husband.

We\nneed to do our duty.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>She climbed onto the featherbed, conscious of his\nstare. A scented beeswax candle burned on the bedside table and rose petals had\nbeen strewn between the sheets. <b>She had\nstarted to pull up a blanket to cover herself when she heard him say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><b><i>The cold made her shiver, but she obeyed.</i></b></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Get+in+the+bed+need+sansa+do+duty&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Sansa III</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>In all of the above passages Tyrion is the one giving the orders and Sansa\nthe one obeying them, knowing she has no other choice but sleep with him. And\nthat is because Tyrion himself doesn&rsquo;t present her with the option to say no;\nsomething that establishes him as a foil to the Beast. Yes, he does have a\nchange of heart at the last moment due to his crisis of conscience, but that\ndoes not negate all the things he said and did before that. And the fact that\nit is ultimately Tyrion who decides that there would be no consummation and not\nSansa, inverts the power dynamics of the original fairytale and erases the\nsovereignty of Sansa&rsquo;s consent.</p><p>Now, back to the comparison between Cocteau&rsquo;s film and ASOIAF, we see that\nthe time Sansa and Tyrion spend together as husband and wife/prisoner is cut\nshort, due to Sansa&rsquo;s escape from King&rsquo;s Landing to go to her &ldquo;father&rdquo;\n(Littlefinger is not Sansa&rsquo;s real father, but he fills that role anyway). </p><p>Sansa&rsquo;s escape takes place during a feast she attends with Tyrion, while\nshe is dressed in a silver and purple gown and wearing her &ldquo;amethyst&rdquo; hairnet.\nThis is a callback to the following scene in &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo;: </p><p><i>Beauty is in the great hall, walking up and down in\nfront of the fire. She is&nbsp;wearing a dark velvet dress. The marble busts at\neach end of the mantlepiece turn their heads to watch her. The clock strikes\nhalf past seven. Beauty looks up at the clock and sees the Beast&rsquo;s reflection\nin the mirror above it. &nbsp;She turns round\nas he walks across the room.</i></p><blockquote><p><i>BEAUTY: How late you are!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Thank you, Beauty, for noticing.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, I was awaiting you with great impatience,\nBeast. </i></p><p><i>She throws herself to her knees and grabs his cloak.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I must talk to you!</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (shocked): Beauty! Beauty!</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (still on her knees, pleading): <b>I cannot live another day without seeing my\nfather again. Please let me go, I beg you!</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: Stand up, Beauty, stand up.</i></p><p><i>He pulls her to her feet and leads her to a chair. He\nsits down beside her.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: I should be on my knees taking orders from\nyou. </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (almost in tears): <b>Let me go. I promise to return.</b> </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: And when you return, will you be my wife? </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (in despair): You&rsquo;re torturing me.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\nknow I&rsquo;m repulsive.</b> <b>But I would die\nof heartbreak if I let you go and you took advantage of your freedom never to return.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>I&rsquo;d\ncome back in a week&rsquo;s time. I respect you too much to cause your death.</b></i></p><p><i>The Beast lowers his head. Beauty strokes it.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST (looking up at her): You coax me as though I\nwere an animal.</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (gently): But you are an animal.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Your\nrequest is a very serious matter. I must think about it.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B&ecirc;te (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>In this scene the Beast shows up late for dinner and Beauty falls to her\nknees before him and begs him to let her go back to her father. The Beast\ndespairs at her request and tells her he will think of it and a few days later,\nhe visits her chambers and makes up his mind:</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty is lying on the bed. The Beast walks over to\nthe foot of the bed.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>Beauty,\nare you ill?</b> </i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: Yes, Beast. I am. </i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: What ails you?</i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: I know my father&rsquo;s dying.</i></p><p><i>THE BEAST: <b>I\ncan&rsquo;t bear to see you waste away.</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY: <b>Send me\nhome to my father.</b></i></p><p><i>THE BEAST:<b> If</b>\n<b>I agree, will you promise to return in a\nweek&rsquo;s time, to the very day?</b></i></p><p><i>BEAUTY (smiling at him): <b>I promise.</b></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.aellea.com/script/qBEAST.htm\"><b><i>La Belle et la B&ecirc;te (Beauty and the Beast) script</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>When he sees her sorrow at having to stay away from her dying father, he\nrelents and lets her go under the condition that she will return to him. He\nputs his faith in her, despite knowing he will die if she doesn&rsquo;t keep her\nword, because her wellbeing and happiness is more important to him than his\nown.</p><p>Tyrion sees Sansa&rsquo;s sorrow before the feast too, but instead of making him\nwant to let her go, it made him want to trap her in another castle instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Their litter had been sitting in the sun, and it was\nvery warm inside the curtains. As they lurched into motion, Tyrion reclined on\nan elbow while Sansa sat staring at her hands. She is just as comely as the\nTyrell girl. Her hair was a rich autumn auburn, her eyes a deep Tully blue. <b>Grief had given her a haunted, vulnerable\nlook; if anything, it had only made her more beautiful.</b> He wanted to reach\nher, to break through the armor of her courtesy. Was that what made him speak?\nOr just the need to distract himself from the fullness in his bladder?</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I had been thinking that when the roads are safe again, we might\njourney to Casterly Rock.&rdquo;</i></b><i> Far from Joffrey and my sister. The more he thought\nabout what Joff had done to Lives of Four Kings, the more it troubled him.\nThere was a message there, oh yes. <b>&ldquo;It\nwould please me to show you the Golden Gallery and the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth, and the\nHall of Heroes where Jaime and I played as boys. You can hear thunder from\nbelow where the sea comes in &hellip;&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>She raised her head slowly. He knew what she was\nseeing; the swollen brutish brow, the raw stump of his nose, his crooked pink\nscar and mismatched eyes. <b>Her own eyes\nwere big and blue and empty. &ldquo;I shall go wherever my lord husband\nwishes.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Hear+thunder+from+below+sea+comes+in&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;scope%5B%5D=adwd&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;scope%5B%5D=affc\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Tyrion VIII</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>And he was provided with a chance to let Sansa go right after that, but he\ndidn&rsquo;t take it, choosing to change the subject instead:</p><blockquote><p><i>Lady Olenna smiled. &ldquo;I am pleased to say <b>I shall be leaving for Highgarden the day\nafter next.</b> I have had quite enough of this smelly city, thank you. Perhaps\nyou would like to accompany me for a little visit, whilst the men are off\nhaving their war? I shall miss my Margaery so dreadfully, and all her lovely\nladies. <b>Your company would be such sweet\nsolace.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You are too kind, my lady,&rdquo; said Sansa,\n&ldquo;but <b>my place is with my lord\nhusband.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Lady Olenna gave Tyrion a wrinkled, toothless smile.\n&ldquo;Oh? Forgive a silly old woman, my lord, I did not mean to steal your\nlovely wife.

Considering the circumstances though, it\nwould have been death to utter such a wish to anyone in court, much less her\nLannister husband to whom she got married against her will. Still, Tyrion had\nguessed she wanted to be free, as demonstrated in the following quotes:</p><blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;<b>Lord Stark asked for his sisters</b> and his father&rsquo;s sword as well,&rdquo;\nSer Cleos reminded him.</i></p><p><i>Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark&rsquo;s greatsword rising\nover one shoulder. &ldquo;Ice,&rdquo; said Tyrion. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have that when he makes his peace\nwith us, not before.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;As you say. And his sisters?&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Tyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as he said, &ldquo;Until\nsuch time as he frees my brother Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as\nhostages.</i></b><i> How well they are treated depends on him.&rdquo; And if the\ngods are good, Bywater will find Arya alive, before Robb learns she&rsquo;s gone\nmissing.</i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Sansa+stab+of+pity&amp;scope%5B%5D=acok&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Tyrion\"><b>A\nClash of Kings - Tyrion VI</b></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>Tyrion rubbed at the raw stub of his nose. The scar tissue itched\nabominably sometimes.<b> &ldquo;His Grace the royal pustule has made Sansa&rsquo;s life a\nmisery since the day her father died, and now that she is finally rid of\nJoffrey you propose to marry her to me. That seems singularly cruel. Even for\nyou, Father.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;If your purpose here is to keep her from the Tyrells, <b>why not return\nher to her mother?</b> Perhaps that would convince Robb Stark to bend the\nknee.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>[&hellip;]</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;You shall never have Casterly Rock, I promise you. But wed Sansa Stark,\nand it is just possible that you might win Winterfell.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>Tyrion Lannister, Lord Protector of Winterfell.

Oh, Mother, no, not that, they haven&rsquo;t\nharmed her, not that way, only&hellip; a bird came last night, but I couldn&rsquo;t bring\nmyself to tell you, not until your father was sent to his rest.&rdquo; Robb took her\nhand. <b>&ldquo;They married her to Tyrion Lannister.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i>Catelyn&rsquo;s fingers clutched at his. &ldquo;The Imp.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</i></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;He swore to trade her for his brother,&rdquo;</i></b><i> she said numbly.\n&ldquo;Sansa and Arya both. We would have them back if we returned his precious\nJaime, he swore it before the whole court. <b>How could he marry her, after\nsaying that in sight of gods and men?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=Catelyn%27s+fingers+clutched+at+his.+%22The+Imp.%22&amp;scope%5B%5D=asos&amp;povs%5B%5D=Catelyn\"><b><i>A\nStorm of Swords - Catelyn IV</i></b></a></p></blockquote><p>The fact that Sansa had to resort to escaping from the Red Keep in secret,\nwithout asking for Tyrion&rsquo;s permission stems from his own inability to cast his\nLannister loyalties aside and do right by her by letting her go, as\ndemonstrated in the above quotes. This once again is meant to accentuate how\ndifferent Tyrion is from Cocteau&rsquo;s Beast in that regard, putting his own fears\nbefore Sansa&rsquo;s needs and happiness.</p><p>Despite Tyrion not giving her his permission to leave, Sansa leaves him\nanyway. And since Tyrion is not the one to release her, she leaves with no strings\nattached. This of course means that since Tyrion never made her promise him she\nwould return, as the Beast had, Sansa never came back for him, even though she\nknew he was facing capital punishment.</p><p>This development in my opinion is GRRM&rsquo;s in-text critique of the Stockholm\nsyndrome usually associated with the more modernized version of the tale of\n&ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; that has been established after the Disney film came out.\n</p><blockquote><p><i>Beauty and the Beast is often accused of supporting a\n&ldquo;Stockholm Syndrome&rdquo; romance. In reality, it reflects what arranged marriages\nwere often like at the time, and the Beast is much kinder than husbands had to\nbe. Disney&rsquo;s film updates the story for a modern audience, but it does so\nproblematically. The drama of the original story was drawn from Beauty\ndiscovering that things are not always as they appear while Disney&rsquo;s drama is\ndrawn from Belle taming Beast.</i></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.germmagazine.com/the-evolution-of-beauty-and-the-beast/\"><i>The\nEvolution of Beauty and the Beast</i></a></b><b></b></p></blockquote><p>As established on the <a href=\"https://lady-in-a-song.tumblr.com/post/173613162675/sansas-beauty-and-the-beast-arc-part-1\">first\npart</a> of this meta, Sansa&rsquo;s arc could very well be the result of GRRM&rsquo;s\ngrievances with Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast&rdquo; adaptation, which actually has\nBelle fall in love with the Beast due to Stockholm syndrome and not because\nhe&rsquo;s being kind and respectful of her like in the original fairytale. </p><p>Tyrion was not as cruel as Joffrey or as vicious as the Hound, but he was a\nfoil to Cocteau&rsquo;s Beast nevertheless. And in order to demonstrate how Tyrion\nwas not worthy of Sansa&rsquo;s love, GRRM never had Sansa fall in love with him or\ncare for him enough to go back and save him, subverting the very problematic\nStockholm Syndrome romance trope Disney established.</p><p>Once more I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjAxS9bTBXtZzqhZR0HXy4w\">@lostlittlesatellites</a> and <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mwWZHOYYX4qznCWYcc2asUw\">@kellyvela</a> who have\nmade the writing of this meta possible with their wonderful ideas and their constant\nsupport.</p>",
