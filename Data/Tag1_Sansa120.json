Jon had changed. Sansa had changed. Arya had changed. Bran had changed. Rickon had changed. Robb had changed.</p><p>They rarely talked about what they had been through. There were no words to describe what they had seen and done to survive.

But she did it without complaining. And whenever the little girl was tired, Sansa was the one to lift her up and carry her around instead, while filling the girl&rsquo;s little head with stories about the past, how things used to be and how they would be again. </p><p>A smile spread across Robb\u2019s face every time he watched her. He caught himself staring at Sansa and little Jeyne when they were crafting flower crowns. He just had to stand still and listen whenever Sansa told little Jeyne one of those stories she used to love so much herself when she had still believed in charming princes and knights in shining armour.

She\u2019ll be so proud of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you.\u201d Robb turned towards her and when his glance met hers he swallowed. \u201cShe&rsquo;ll be so proud of you.\u201d He spoke softly and with his thumb he wiped a strand of long red hair from Sansa\u2019s face. \u201cIf only she had known that Jon\u2026\u201d Robb didn\u2019t finish his sentence. </p><p>Would Catelyn have treated Jon differently if she had known that he was Lyanna\u2019s and not Ned\u2019s? Would she have tried to be a mother to him, just like Sansa was now doing for Jeyne?</p><p>They had so many questions for their parents and there were so many times Robb wished he could ask his father or mother for advice, even though he knew that he had not listened to them when they were still alive. He used to hate all those so called wisdom, how they had treated him like a child. Now he was a grown up man, but he would give a lot to be able to talk to them once more, to ask for their guidance once more.</p><p>Although he already knew what they would say if he would tell them what he truly felt when he looked at Sansa, what he truly wanted when he listened to her stories and what he truly thought about when she was singing her lullabies.</p><p>And yet, the more he tried to fight it, the stronger the feelings grew. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He whispered and he pulled her away from the bed where Jeyne was sleeping. The palms of his hands were sweating, but he didn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you want a family of your own? A husband? Children?\u201d He tried to keep his hands steady and didn\u2019t dare to look at her. But when his eyes found her lips anyway, forming a straight line, he gathered the courage to look straight into her eyes.</p><p>Slightly she shook her head. \u201cHow can I ever trust a man ever again?\u201d There were no tears in her eyes, but her grip on his hand tightened.</p><p>\u201cWould you trust me?\u201d Robb whispered and his voice was trembling, but he kept his glance firmly locked with hers. </p><p>For a short moment there was nothing but silence.</p><p>Sansa furrowed her eyebrows. She opened her mouth to say something, but closed it again. </p><p>Robb shook his head. \u201cI know it\u2019s wrong. But there are many things wrong in this world and we all do them anyway.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cMurder. War. Rape. Violence. Torture. It\u2019s all wrong, but people do it.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I follow my heart and love you? Would it really be that bad?\u201d</p><p>There was more silence.</p><p>And once more Sansa attempted to say something, but didn\u2019t seem to find the right words. But eventually she cocked her head and licked her dry lips. \u201cThe Targaryens went mad eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually\u2026\u201d Robb quickly replied. \u201cAfter generation after generation after generation.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJeoffrey was mad too.\u201d Sansa mumbled, but there was no fire in any of her words.</p><p>\u201cBut Myrcella and Tommen were not. They were kind. Spoiled. But good.\u201d Robb felt the adrenaline rushing through his veins. \u201cAnd our children will have you. And me. And Jon and Rickon and Bran and Arya.\u201d He leaned towards her so his forehead touched hers. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll have big sister Jeyne too.\u201d</p><p>Sansa closed her eyes, but she didn\u2019t pull away from him, she didn\u2019t pull back her hand, she didn\u2019t fight his touch. \u201cWe live in a horrible world, Robb.\u201d She moved her head a little and he could feel her breath against his lips. </p><p>\u201cLet&rsquo;s make it a little more beautiful then.\u201d He whispered and then her lips finally brushed his.</p><p>Softly at first, a little reluctantly and hesitant. But then she kissed him more firmly, parting her lips slightly so their tongues could touch. </p><p>He let her hand go and wrapped both his arms around her waist, pulling her closer and closer towards him. And while she buried her hands in his curls he knew for sure that something that felt this good couldn\u2019t be wrong. Not really.</p>",

Now he was a grown up man, but he would give a lot to be able to talk to them once more, to ask for their guidance once more.</p><p>Although he already knew what they would say if he would tell them what he truly felt when he looked at Sansa, what he truly wanted when he listened to her stories and what he truly thought about when she was singing her lullabies.</p><p>And yet, the more he tried to fight it, the stronger the feelings grew. </p><p>\u201cSansa?\u201d He whispered and he pulled her away from the bed where Jeyne was sleeping.

Nowhere did I say &ldquo;Sansa is gonna dog walk Dany&rdquo; or anything like that.
