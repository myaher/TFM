Some people are born evil, some achieve evil, and some have evil thrust upon them.</p><p>You were a combination of the first and last.</p><p>Your dad was John Garret. Known under many aliases, including Deathlok and the Clairvoyant, he was a powerful member of Hydra. You were raised hearing his two twisted mottos:</p><p>First, <i>You can\u2019t ever get attached to anyone or anything. You have to fight that weakness inside you.</i></p><p>And second, <i>Don\u2019t trust anyone, ever. Especially me.</i></p><p>For most of your life, you just went along with it. Your dad was evil, so you felt like you were born evil. The evil was thrust upon you. You weren\u2019t given a choice between one side or the other. Growing up, you didn\u2019t know any better anyway. You agreed with the things your dad told you because it was the only thing you heard. Hydra was superior. SHIELD were the wrong ones. You had no reason to ever question him. For your whole life, you proudly hailed Hydra.</p><p>When you entered high school, things changed. You changed. You were more exposed to other opinions and so many good people who believed in good. Believed in SHIELD. Believed in heroes. At Midtown High, you became friends with Peter, Ned, and MJ. It made everything in your life so confusing. You started to question the exact principles you were raised on. Your friends stood for everything your dad was against. Everything you were raised to be against. Especially Peter. Peter was all about the Avengers. He spoke so earnestly about what they stood for that, soon enough, you started to believe in them too.</p><p>And then, you did the really stupid thing, and you fell in love with Peter. Peter who your dad would despise. Peter who worshiped SHIELD and stood for everything good. Peter who you knew was Spider-Man.</p><p>Peter, Peter, Peter.</p><p>Just like that, the first of your father\u2019s mottos was ignored.</p><p><i><strike>You can\u2019t ever get attached to anyone or anything.</strike></i></p><p>You loved your friends more than anything. You couldn\u2019t imagine your teenage years without them. You were attached. If anything happened to them, you had no idea what you would do. That\u2019s why you hated every mission that pinned Hydra against the Avengers. It put Peter in immediate danger, but you couldn\u2019t say anything to anybody about it. You couldn\u2019t warn Peter of Hydra\u2019s plans, because it would make Peter see who you really were. That was an identity you were trying so hard to hide from him. But you couldn\u2019t ask your dad to ease up on the heroes, because that would show your weakness. The weakness you were supposed to fight.</p><p>You were stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>When you turned 16, your dad decided it was time for you to suit up and join the team. His team. Hydra. Your worst nightmare was coming true. Deep down, you always knew the day would come, but you had delusionally told yourself that it wouldn\u2019t. You had to pretend you had been waiting for the day, when in reality you had been dreading it.</p><!-- more --><p>You had heard the stories of recruits from days\u2019 past. You knew Grant Ward. You knew about his life and all of the events that lead up to his initiation. You knew the aftermath of his recruitment, how he dropped Fitz and Simmons -two respected agents of SHIELD- in the bottom of the ocean. You knew. You knew about it all. And you knew your dad expected you to turn out the same. He expected you to kill the things you were attached to. To get rid of your weaknesses.</p><p>But you couldn\u2019t do it. You couldn\u2019t do it, because you <i>weren\u2019t</i> Ward. You weren\u2019t evil. You couldn\u2019t look your dog in the eyes and kill it. That was it. That was the initiation. Kill the thing you loved. So, when your dad left you in the middle of the woods with Sparky -the dog you grew up with- and a gun, you shot a bullet into the air and let your dog run free. What your dad didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Still, this meant you were Hydra now. You were a part of it all. A part of all the evil. The worst thing was not having any friends to confide in. The night of your initiation, you had to cry yourself to sleep with the guilt of being evil weighing on your chest. Alone.</p><p>The next day, you were in your first Hydra mission meeting. You sat around the table with people you knew by name from hearing endless praise from your dad. Your dad sat at the head, giving a rundown of the mission. With your intel at SHIELD, you knew all of the insider details. This also meant you knew that the Avengers were on a mission to destroy all of Hydra\u2019s bases. In order to beat them to the punch, Hydra\u2019s mission was to find, corner, and destroy each of the Avengers. They were stronger together, so taking them down one by one rather than as a unit was their strategy.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d your dad said, getting your attention. You had been zoning out, staring at your hands and twirling your pen between your fingers. \u201cYour target is-\u201d He paused and flicked through some of his papers. \u201c-Spider-Man.\u201d You took in a sharp breath that made everyone turn to look at you. Your dad raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d you stuttered through your words, \u201cI\u2019m doing it alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sources say Spider-Man is a low threat,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis should be a simple task for you to handle independently.\u201d He looked at you sternly. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d You clenched your jaw and shook your head no.</p><p>\u201cNo sir,\u201d you said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Your father gave you a short nod and handed you his packet on Spider-Man. You flicked through it, feeling numb and tuning out the rest of the meeting. Hydra knew Peter was Spider-Man because SHIELD knew, and SHIELD knew because the Avengers knew. You stared at all the information on Peter. Where he lived. Where he went to school. His family. His usual evening routine.</p><p>It all made you sick.</p><p>How were you supposed to do this? Capture -and kill?- your best friend, or become your father\u2019s enemy. Sure, your dad was evil, but he was still your dad. He would still love you even if you didn\u2019t want to be Hydra, right? Still, you couldn\u2019t help but consider the worst case scenario.\u00a0Would he kill you if you went against his beliefs and stood firm in your own? You knew better than to underestimate him.</p><p>The next night, you suited up and crept out of the Hydra facility. At that time of night -10:00- Peter would be swinging around Queens on patrol. You had a loose version of a plan, and every part of it involved betraying your best friend.</p><p>You hid in the shadows of one of the alleys you knew Peter frequently passed. When you found out he was Spider-Man, he took you on his patrol route just for fun. You loved swinging the New York skies with him. At the exact time you expected him, Peter swung down from the sky and landed in the alley. His eyes scanned the darkness, unable to find you in your stealth suit. So, the minute he walked by, you knocked him unconscious before he could see you.</p><p>Every member of Hydra had their own designated area to complete their mission that night. That way, each member\u2019s task of kidnapping, torturing, and killing (if necessary) could be done independently and without the watchful eyes of other members of Hydra. Because Hydra also lived by your dad\u2019s second motto: <i>don\u2019t trust anyone</i>. To Hydra, that included each other.</p><p>When you got to your location, you stripped Peter of his suit and tied him to a chair. You cringed the entire time, realizing that it all looked far more sexual than you intended it to. But you knew what Peter\u2019s suit could do, and leaving him in it would give you a definite disadvantage.</p><p>You stayed behind Peter, not wanting him to see your face as soon as he came to. When he did, he lifted his head slowly and turned his head to the side, then tugged on his restraints. Even his super strength wouldn\u2019t be able to get him out of his bondage. You had made sure of it. \u201cShow yourself!\u201d Peter shouted. You felt your lower lip quiver as his movements to escape became rougher. You knew what your next step was. You just hated it. This was your least favorite part of the mission you had planned.</p><p>You slowly stepped in front of Peter, hoping you looked more confident than you felt. \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Peter asked. His eyebrows were furrowed, his eyes full of confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said. Your voice cracked horribly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) please,\u201d Peter begged. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d You cleared your throat. You didn\u2019t know how to tell him. How do you tell your best friend that you\u2019re part of an organization created by Nazis?</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019m Hydra.\u201d</p><p>Okay. There were probably better ways to say that.</p><p>Peter laughed. He actually laughed, tossing his head back and screwing his eyes shut. When he finally caught his breath, he looked at you again. As soon as he saw you weren\u2019t returning his smile, his face dropped. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? You can\u2019t actually be Hydra.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally studied your outfit more. When he noticed the Hydra patch on your shoulder, he took in a sharp breath. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t real. I\u2019m dreaming. You\u2019re not Hydra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said again. Tears were coming to your eyes now. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to be. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why the <i>hell</i> are you doing this?\u201d he asked. His voice cracked as tears came to his eyes as well.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d you said. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I defied him, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so why am I here?\u201d he asked, tugging at his restraints again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been assigned a target,\u201d you said. Tears were streaming down your face, but you couldn\u2019t look away from Peter. You knew you had to look him in the eyes while you said this. You owed him that much. Peter\u2019s eyes grew wide, and his lips parted.</p><p>\u201cM-Me?\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201c<b>I wish it wasn\u2019t you</b>,\u201d you said, \u201c<b>but it is, and I\u2019m so sorry</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d he asked. He wasn\u2019t hurt anymore. He was mad. \u201cKill me? Torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to hold you here,\u201d you said. \u201cI have to get information out of you about, about your plan to take down the Hydra bases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t tell you?\u201d he said. You pressed your lips together and shook your head.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me say it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Peter almost shouted. \u201cFucking kill me! Because I\u2019m not telling you anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to do this?\u201d you yelled, throwing your arms in the air. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like being a part of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do this, I think my dad will kill me!\u201d</p><p>Silence rang throughout the room. Peter\u2019s original look of anger softened and was replaced by pity. You almost preferred the anger. If there was one emotion you hated, it was pity. That was probably your dad\u2019s influence on you. \u201cJesus Christ, (Y/N),\u201d he said. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause SHIELD is everything to you,\u201d you said. \u201cThey\u2019re everything good, and I\u2019m like a glorified Nazi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but not by choice,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou\u2019re good in your heart. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d you said, your voice dropping.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to untie me, and I\u2019m going to take you to the compound. They\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy,\u201d you whispered, hanging your head.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your chance to turn it all around. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d You met your eyes with his and saw the sincerity in them. Another tear fell from your eyes as you walked up to him and undid his restraints. With no hesitation, Peter wrapped his arms around you and pulled you in for a hug. You cried softly into his shoulder, and Peter let you with no complaint. Finally, you pulled away from each other, and Peter tugged his suit back on. For the first time in your life, you felt<i> good</i>. You weren\u2019t Ward. And you weren\u2019t your dad. You were you. And you believed in heroes.</p><p>You and Peter headed towards the doors of the building you were in. You felt invincible. Peter filled you with hope.</p><p>As soon as you opened the door to head outside, you came face to face with your father. You jumped and put your arm in front of Peter protectively. Your dad sighed and shook his head, disappointment written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI knew I saw a weakness in you.\u201d</p><p><i><strike>Don\u2019t trust anyone, ever. Especially me.</strike></i></p>",

Kill the thing you loved. So, when your dad left you in the middle of the woods with Sparky -the dog you grew up with- and a gun, you shot a bullet into the air and let your dog run free. What your dad didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Still, this meant you were Hydra now. You were a part of it all. A part of all the evil. The worst thing was not having any friends to confide in. The night of your initiation, you had to cry yourself to sleep with the guilt of being evil weighing on your chest. Alone.</p><p>The next day, you were in your first Hydra mission meeting. You sat around the table with people you knew by name from hearing endless praise from your dad. Your dad sat at the head, giving a rundown of the mission. With your intel at SHIELD, you knew all of the insider details. This also meant you knew that the Avengers were on a mission to destroy all of Hydra\u2019s bases. In order to beat them to the punch, Hydra\u2019s mission was to find, corner, and destroy each of the Avengers. They were stronger together, so taking them down one by one rather than as a unit was their strategy.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d your dad said, getting your attention. You had been zoning out, staring at your hands and twirling your pen between your fingers. \u201cYour target is-\u201d He paused and flicked through some of his papers. \u201c-Spider-Man.\u201d You took in a sharp breath that made everyone turn to look at you. Your dad raised his eyebrows. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just,\u201d you stuttered through your words, \u201cI\u2019m doing it alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sources say Spider-Man is a low threat,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis should be a simple task for you to handle independently.\u201d He looked at you sternly. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d You clenched your jaw and shook your head no.</p><p>\u201cNo sir,\u201d you said. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Your father gave you a short nod and handed you his packet on Spider-Man. You flicked through it, feeling numb and tuning out the rest of the meeting. Hydra knew Peter was Spider-Man because SHIELD knew, and SHIELD knew because the Avengers knew. You stared at all the information on Peter. Where he lived. Where he went to school. His family. His usual evening routine.</p><p>It all made you sick.</p><p>How were you supposed to do this? Capture -and kill?- your best friend, or become your father\u2019s enemy. Sure, your dad was evil, but he was still your dad. He would still love you even if you didn\u2019t want to be Hydra, right? Still, you couldn\u2019t help but consider the worst case scenario.\u00a0Would he kill you if you went against his beliefs and stood firm in your own? You knew better than to underestimate him.</p><p>The next night, you suited up and crept out of the Hydra facility. At that time of night -10:00- Peter would be swinging around Queens on patrol. You had a loose version of a plan, and every part of it involved betraying your best friend.</p><p>You hid in the shadows of one of the alleys you knew Peter frequently passed. When you found out he was Spider-Man, he took you on his patrol route just for fun. You loved swinging the New York skies with him. At the exact time you expected him, Peter swung down from the sky and landed in the alley. His eyes scanned the darkness, unable to find you in your stealth suit. So, the minute he walked by, you knocked him unconscious before he could see you.</p><p>Every member of Hydra had their own designated area to complete their mission that night. That way, each member\u2019s task of kidnapping, torturing, and killing (if necessary) could be done independently and without the watchful eyes of other members of Hydra. Because Hydra also lived by your dad\u2019s second motto: <i>don\u2019t trust anyone</i>. To Hydra, that included each other.</p><p>When you got to your location, you stripped Peter of his suit and tied him to a chair. You cringed the entire time, realizing that it all looked far more sexual than you intended it to. But you knew what Peter\u2019s suit could do, and leaving him in it would give you a definite disadvantage.</p><p>You stayed behind Peter, not wanting him to see your face as soon as he came to. When he did, he lifted his head slowly and turned his head to the side, then tugged on his restraints. Even his super strength wouldn\u2019t be able to get him out of his bondage. You had made sure of it. \u201cShow yourself!\u201d Peter shouted. You felt your lower lip quiver as his movements to escape became rougher. You knew what your next step was. You just hated it. This was your least favorite part of the mission you had planned.</p><p>You slowly stepped in front of Peter, hoping you looked more confident than you felt. \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d Peter asked. His eyebrows were furrowed, his eyes full of confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said. Your voice cracked horribly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) please,\u201d Peter begged. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re doing.\u201d You cleared your throat. You didn\u2019t know how to tell him. How do you tell your best friend that you\u2019re part of an organization created by Nazis?</p><p>\u201cPeter, I\u2019m Hydra.\u201d</p><p>Okay. There were probably better ways to say that.</p><p>Peter laughed. He actually laughed, tossing his head back and screwing his eyes shut. When he finally caught his breath, he looked at you again. As soon as he saw you weren\u2019t returning his smile, his face dropped. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? You can\u2019t actually be Hydra.\u201d</p><p>Peter finally studied your outfit more. When he noticed the Hydra patch on your shoulder, he took in a sharp breath. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNo. This isn\u2019t real. I\u2019m dreaming. You\u2019re not Hydra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said again. Tears were coming to your eyes now. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to be. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why the <i>hell</i> are you doing this?\u201d he asked. His voice cracked as tears came to his eyes as well.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d you said. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I defied him, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so why am I here?\u201d he asked, tugging at his restraints again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been assigned a target,\u201d you said. Tears were streaming down your face, but you couldn\u2019t look away from Peter. You knew you had to look him in the eyes while you said this. You owed him that much. Peter\u2019s eyes grew wide, and his lips parted.</p><p>\u201cM-Me?\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201c<b>I wish it wasn\u2019t you</b>,\u201d you said, \u201c<b>but it is, and I\u2019m so sorry</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d he asked. He wasn\u2019t hurt anymore. He was mad. \u201cKill me? Torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to hold you here,\u201d you said. \u201cI have to get information out of you about, about your plan to take down the Hydra bases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t tell you?\u201d he said. You pressed your lips together and shook your head.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me say it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Peter almost shouted. \u201cFucking kill me! Because I\u2019m not telling you anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to do this?\u201d you yelled, throwing your arms in the air. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like being a part of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do this, I think my dad will kill me!\u201d</p><p>Silence rang throughout the room. Peter\u2019s original look of anger softened and was replaced by pity. You almost preferred the anger. If there was one emotion you hated, it was pity. That was probably your dad\u2019s influence on you. \u201cJesus Christ, (Y/N),\u201d he said. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause SHIELD is everything to you,\u201d you said. \u201cThey\u2019re everything good, and I\u2019m like a glorified Nazi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but not by choice,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou\u2019re good in your heart. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d you said, your voice dropping.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to untie me, and I\u2019m going to take you to the compound. They\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy,\u201d you whispered, hanging your head.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your chance to turn it all around. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d You met your eyes with his and saw the sincerity in them. Another tear fell from your eyes as you walked up to him and undid his restraints. With no hesitation, Peter wrapped his arms around you and pulled you in for a hug. You cried softly into his shoulder, and Peter let you with no complaint. Finally, you pulled away from each other, and Peter tugged his suit back on. For the first time in your life, you felt<i> good</i>. You weren\u2019t Ward. And you weren\u2019t your dad. You were you. And you believed in heroes.</p><p>You and Peter headed towards the doors of the building you were in. You felt invincible. Peter filled you with hope.</p><p>As soon as you opened the door to head outside, you came face to face with your father. You jumped and put your arm in front of Peter protectively. Your dad sighed and shook his head, disappointment written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI knew I saw a weakness in you.\u201d</p><p><i><strike>Don\u2019t trust anyone, ever. Especially me.</strike></i></p>",

Some people are born evil, some achieve evil, and some have evil thrust upon them.</p><p>You were a combination of the first and last.</p><p>Your dad was John Garret. Known under many aliases, including Deathlok and the Clairvoyant, he was a powerful member of Hydra. You were raised hearing his two twisted mottos:</p><p>First, <i>You can\u2019t ever get attached to anyone or anything. You have to fight that weakness inside you.</i></p><p>And second, <i>Don\u2019t trust anyone, ever. Especially me.</i></p><p>For most of your life, you just went along with it. Your dad was evil, so you felt like you were born evil. The evil was thrust upon you. You weren\u2019t given a choice between one side or the other. Growing up, you didn\u2019t know any better anyway. You agreed with the things your dad told you because it was the only thing you heard. Hydra was superior. SHIELD were the wrong ones. You had no reason to ever question him. For your whole life, you proudly hailed Hydra.</p><p>When you entered high school, things changed. You changed. You were more exposed to other opinions and so many good people who believed in good. Believed in SHIELD. Believed in heroes. At Midtown High, you became friends with Peter, Ned, and MJ. It made everything in your life so confusing. You started to question the exact principles you were raised on. Your friends stood for everything your dad was against. Everything you were raised to be against. Especially Peter. Peter was all about the Avengers. He spoke so earnestly about what they stood for that, soon enough, you started to believe in them too.</p><p>And then, you did the really stupid thing, and you fell in love with Peter. Peter who your dad would despise. Peter who worshiped SHIELD and stood for everything good. Peter who you knew was Spider-Man.</p><p>Peter, Peter, Peter.</p><p>Just like that, the first of your father\u2019s mottos was ignored.</p><p><i><strike>You can\u2019t ever get attached to anyone or anything.</strike></i></p><p>You loved your friends more than anything. You couldn\u2019t imagine your teenage years without them. You were attached. If anything happened to them, you had no idea what you would do. That\u2019s why you hated every mission that pinned Hydra against the Avengers. It put Peter in immediate danger, but you couldn\u2019t say anything to anybody about it. You couldn\u2019t warn Peter of Hydra\u2019s plans, because it would make Peter see who you really were. That was an identity you were trying so hard to hide from him. But you couldn\u2019t ask your dad to ease up on the heroes, because that would show your weakness. The weakness you were supposed to fight.</p><p>You were stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>When you turned 16, your dad decided it was time for you to suit up and join the team. His team. Hydra. Your worst nightmare was coming true. Deep down, you always knew the day would come, but you had delusionally told yourself that it wouldn\u2019t. You had to pretend you had been waiting for the day, when in reality you had been dreading it.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You had heard the stories of recruits from days\u2019 past. You knew Grant Ward. You knew about his life and all of the events that lead up to his initiation. You knew the aftermath of his recruitment, how he dropped Fitz and Simmons -two respected agents of SHIELD- in the bottom of the ocean. You knew. You knew about it all. And you knew your dad expected you to turn out the same. He expected you to kill the things you were attached to. To get rid of your weaknesses.</p><p>But you couldn\u2019t do it. You couldn\u2019t do it, because you <i>weren\u2019t</i> Ward. You weren\u2019t evil. You couldn\u2019t look your dog in the eyes and kill it. That was it. That was the initiation. Kill the thing you loved. So, when your dad left you in the middle of the woods with Sparky -the dog you grew up with- and a gun, you shot a bullet into the air and let your dog run free. What your dad didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Still, this meant you were Hydra now. You were a part of it all. A part of all the evil. The worst thing was not having any friends to confide in. The night of your initiation, you had to cry yourself to sleep with the guilt of being evil weighing on your chest. Alone.</p><p>The next day, you were in your first Hydra mission meeting. You sat around the table with people you knew by name from hearing endless praise from your dad. Your dad sat at the head, giving a rundown of the mission. With your intel at SHIELD, you knew all of the insider details. This also meant you knew that the Avengers were on a mission to destroy all of Hydra\u2019s bases. In order to beat them to the punch, Hydra\u2019s mission was to find, corner, and destroy each of the Avengers. They were stronger together, so taking them down one by one rather than as a unit was their strategy.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N),\u201d your dad said, getting your attention.

You\u2019re not Hydra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said again. Tears were coming to your eyes now. \u201cIt\u2019s my dad. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to be. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why the <i>hell</i> are you doing this?\u201d he asked. His voice cracked as tears came to his eyes as well.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d you said. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I defied him, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so why am I here?\u201d he asked, tugging at his restraints again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been assigned a target,\u201d you said. Tears were streaming down your face, but you couldn\u2019t look away from Peter. You knew you had to look him in the eyes while you said this. You owed him that much. Peter\u2019s eyes grew wide, and his lips parted.</p><p>\u201cM-Me?\u201d he stuttered.</p><p>\u201c<b>I wish it wasn\u2019t you</b>,\u201d you said, \u201c<b>but it is, and I\u2019m so sorry</b>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d he asked. He wasn\u2019t hurt anymore. He was mad. \u201cKill me? Torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to hold you here,\u201d you said. \u201cI have to get information out of you about, about your plan to take down the Hydra bases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t tell you?\u201d he said. You pressed your lips together and shook your head.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me say it,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Peter almost shouted. \u201cFucking kill me! Because I\u2019m not telling you anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to do this?\u201d you yelled, throwing your arms in the air. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like being a part of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do this, I think my dad will kill me!\u201d</p><p>Silence rang throughout the room. Peter\u2019s original look of anger softened and was replaced by pity. You almost preferred the anger. If there was one emotion you hated, it was pity. That was probably your dad\u2019s influence on you. \u201cJesus Christ, (Y/N),\u201d he said. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you ever told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause SHIELD is everything to you,\u201d you said. \u201cThey\u2019re everything good, and I\u2019m like a glorified Nazi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but not by choice,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou\u2019re good in your heart. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d you said, your voice dropping.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to untie me, and I\u2019m going to take you to the compound. They\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy,\u201d you whispered, hanging your head.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is your chance to turn it all around. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d You met your eyes with his and saw the sincerity in them. Another tear fell from your eyes as you walked up to him and undid his restraints. With no hesitation, Peter wrapped his arms around you and pulled you in for a hug. You cried softly into his shoulder, and Peter let you with no complaint. Finally, you pulled away from each other, and Peter tugged his suit back on. For the first time in your life, you felt<i> good</i>. You weren\u2019t Ward. And you weren\u2019t your dad. You were you. And you believed in heroes.</p><p>You and Peter headed towards the doors of the building you were in. You felt invincible. Peter filled you with hope.</p><p>As soon as you opened the door to head outside, you came face to face with your father. You jumped and put your arm in front of Peter protectively. Your dad sighed and shook his head, disappointment written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI knew I saw a weakness in you.\u201d</p><p><i><strike>Don\u2019t trust anyone, ever.

Some people are born evil, some achieve evil, and some have evil thrust upon them.</p><p>You were a combination of the first and last.</p><p>Your dad was John Garret. Known under many aliases, including Deathlok and the Clairvoyant, he was a powerful member of Hydra. You were raised hearing his two twisted mottos:</p><p>First, <i>You can&rsquo;t ever get attached to anyone or anything. You have to fight that weakness inside you.</i></p><p>And second, <i>Don&rsquo;t trust anyone, ever. Especially me.</i></p><p>For most of your life, you just went along with it. Your dad was evil, so you felt like you were born evil. The evil was thrust upon you. You weren&rsquo;t given a choice between one side or the other. Growing up, you didn&rsquo;t know any better anyway. You agreed with the things your dad told you because it was the only thing you heard. Hydra was superior. SHIELD were the wrong ones. You had no reason to ever question him. For your whole life, you proudly hailed Hydra.</p><p>When you entered high school, things changed. You changed. You were more exposed to other opinions and so many good people who believed in good. Believed in SHIELD. Believed in heroes. At Midtown High, you became friends with Peter, Ned, and MJ. It made everything in your life so confusing. You started to question the exact principles you were raised on. Your friends stood for everything your dad was against. Everything you were raised to be against. Especially Peter. Peter was all about the Avengers. He spoke so earnestly about what they stood for that, soon enough, you started to believe in them too.</p><p>And then, you did the really stupid thing, and you fell in love with Peter. Peter who your dad would despise. Peter who worshiped SHIELD and stood for everything good. Peter who you knew was Spider-Man.</p><p>Peter, Peter, Peter.</p><p>Just like that, the first of your father&rsquo;s mottos was ignored.</p><p><i><strike>You can&rsquo;t ever get attached to anyone or anything.</strike></i></p><p>You loved your friends more than anything. You couldn&rsquo;t imagine your teenage years without them. You were attached. If anything happened to them, you had no idea what you would do. That&rsquo;s why you hated every mission that pinned Hydra against the Avengers. It put Peter in immediate danger, but you couldn&rsquo;t say anything to anybody about it. You couldn&rsquo;t warn Peter of Hydra&rsquo;s plans, because it would make Peter see who you really were. That was an identity you were trying so hard to hide from him. But you couldn&rsquo;t ask your dad to ease up on the heroes, because that would show your weakness. The weakness you were supposed to fight.</p><p>You were stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>When you turned 16, your dad decided it was time for you to suit up and join the team. His team. Hydra. Your worst nightmare was coming true. Deep down, you always knew the day would come, but you had delusionally told yourself that it wouldn&rsquo;t. You had to pretend you had been waiting for the day, when in reality you had been dreading it.</p><p>You had heard the stories of recruits from days&rsquo; past. You knew Grant Ward. You knew about his life and all of the events that lead up to his initiation. You knew the aftermath of his recruitment, how he dropped Fitz and Simmons -two respected agents of SHIELD- in the bottom of the ocean. You knew. You knew about it all. And you knew your dad expected you to turn out the same. He expected you to kill the things you were attached to. To get rid of your weaknesses.</p><p>But you couldn&rsquo;t do it. You couldn&rsquo;t do it, because you <i>weren&rsquo;t</i> Ward. You weren&rsquo;t evil. You couldn&rsquo;t look your dog in the eyes and kill it. That was it. That was the initiation. Kill the thing you loved. So, when your dad left you in the middle of the woods with Sparky -the dog you grew up with- and a gun, you shot a bullet into the air and let your dog run free. What your dad didn&rsquo;t know didn&rsquo;t hurt.</p><p>Still, this meant you were Hydra now. You were a part of it all. A part of all the evil. The worst thing was not having any friends to confide in. The night of your initiation, you had to cry yourself to sleep with the guilt of being evil weighing on your chest. Alone.</p><p>The next day, you were in your first Hydra mission meeting. You sat around the table with people you knew by name from hearing endless praise from your dad. Your dad sat at the head, giving a rundown of the mission. With your intel at SHIELD, you knew all of the insider details. This also meant you knew that the Avengers were on a mission to destroy all of Hydra&rsquo;s bases. In order to beat them to the punch, Hydra&rsquo;s mission was to find, corner, and destroy each of the Avengers. They were stronger together, so taking them down one by one rather than as a unit was their strategy.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N),&rdquo; your dad said, getting your attention. You had been zoning out, staring at your hands and twirling your pen between your fingers. &ldquo;Your target is-&rdquo; He paused and flicked through some of his papers. &ldquo;-Spider-Man.&rdquo; You took in a sharp breath that made everyone turn to look at you. Your dad raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Is that a problem?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I just,&rdquo; you stuttered through your words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our sources say Spider-Man is a low threat,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;This should be a simple task for you to handle independently.&rdquo; He looked at you sternly. &ldquo;Is that a problem?&rdquo; You clenched your jaw and shook your head no.</p><p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo; Your father gave you a short nod and handed you his packet on Spider-Man. You flicked through it, feeling numb and tuning out the rest of the meeting. Hydra knew Peter was Spider-Man because SHIELD knew, and SHIELD knew because the Avengers knew. You stared at all the information on Peter. Where he lived. Where he went to school. His family. His usual evening routine.</p><p>It all made you sick.</p><p>How were you supposed to do this? Capture -and kill?- your best friend, or become your father&rsquo;s enemy. Sure, your dad was evil, but he was still your dad. He would still love you even if you didn&rsquo;t want to be Hydra, right? Still, you couldn&rsquo;t help but consider the worst case scenario.&nbsp;Would he kill you if you went against his beliefs and stood firm in your own? You knew better than to underestimate him.</p><p>The next night, you suited up and crept out of the Hydra facility. At that time of night -10:00- Peter would be swinging around Queens on patrol. You had a loose version of a plan, and every part of it involved betraying your best friend.</p><p>You hid in the shadows of one of the alleys you knew Peter frequently passed. When you found out he was Spider-Man, he took you on his patrol route just for fun. You loved swinging the New York skies with him. At the exact time you expected him, Peter swung down from the sky and landed in the alley. His eyes scanned the darkness, unable to find you in your stealth suit. So, the minute he walked by, you knocked him unconscious before he could see you.</p><p>Every member of Hydra had their own designated area to complete their mission that night. That way, each member&rsquo;s task of kidnapping, torturing, and killing (if necessary) could be done independently and without the watchful eyes of other members of Hydra. Because Hydra also lived by your dad&rsquo;s second motto: <i>don&rsquo;t trust anyone</i>. To Hydra, that included each other.</p><p>When you got to your location, you stripped Peter of his suit and tied him to a chair. You cringed the entire time, realizing that it all looked far more sexual than you intended it to. But you knew what Peter&rsquo;s suit could do, and leaving him in it would give you a definite disadvantage.</p><p>You stayed behind Peter, not wanting him to see your face as soon as he came to. When he did, he lifted his head slowly and turned his head to the side, then tugged on his restraints. Even his super strength wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get him out of his bondage. You had made sure of it. &ldquo;Show yourself!&rdquo; Peter shouted. You felt your lower lip quiver as his movements to escape became rougher. You knew what your next step was. You just hated it. This was your least favorite part of the mission you had planned.</p><p>You slowly stepped in front of Peter, hoping you looked more confident than you felt. &ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; Peter asked. His eyebrows were furrowed, his eyes full of confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? What the hell are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you said. Your voice cracked horribly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) please,&rdquo; Peter begged. &ldquo;Tell me what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; You cleared your throat. You didn&rsquo;t know how to tell him. How do you tell your best friend that you&rsquo;re part of an organization created by Nazis?</p><p>&ldquo;Peter, I&rsquo;m Hydra.&rdquo;</p><p>Okay. There were probably better ways to say that.</p><p>Peter laughed. He actually laughed, tossing his head back and screwing his eyes shut. When he finally caught his breath, he looked at you again. As soon as he saw you weren&rsquo;t returning his smile, his face dropped. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking, right? You can&rsquo;t actually be Hydra.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter finally studied your outfit more. When he noticed the Hydra patch on your shoulder, he took in a sharp breath. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;No. This isn&rsquo;t real. I&rsquo;m dreaming. You&rsquo;re not Hydra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you said again. Tears were coming to your eyes now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dad. I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want to be. You have to know that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So why the <i>hell</i> are you doing this?&rdquo; he asked. His voice cracked as tears came to his eyes as well.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. If I defied him, I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so why am I here?&rdquo; he asked, tugging at his restraints again.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been assigned a target,&rdquo; you said. Tears were streaming down your face, but you couldn&rsquo;t look away from Peter. You knew you had to look him in the eyes while you said this. You owed him that much. Peter&rsquo;s eyes grew wide, and his lips parted.</p><p>&ldquo;M-Me?&rdquo; he stuttered.</p><p>&ldquo;<b>I wish it wasn&rsquo;t you</b>,&rdquo; you said, &ldquo;<b>but it is, and I&rsquo;m so sorry</b>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what are you going to do?&rdquo; he asked. He wasn&rsquo;t hurt anymore. He was mad. &ldquo;Kill me? Torture me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just supposed to hold you here,&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;I have to get information out of you about, about your plan to take down the Hydra bases.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo; he said.

(also i might be starting to write smut sometime in the not too distant future&hellip;..) okay bye!!</i></b></p><p><b>It was</b> two in the morning. You were still awake\u2026 and very drunk. <i>Very</i> drunk\u2014 which is never a good state for you to be in. But that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re left alone, sad, on a Friday evening. Your roommate\u2019s family lived close to the ESU campus, so she\u2019d often go home for the weekend, most of your friends were home this weekend, but not you. You\u2019d rather cry yourself to sleep while drinking your secret stash of booze than go home right now.</p><p>Just hours previous to that very moment, you\u2019d gotten dumped. Via text. Why did it have to be text? This isn\u2019t high school, you were adults in college for christ&rsquo;s sake! Your now ex-boyfriend constructed a long and drawn out paragraph, spelling out how he\u2019d <i>\u201cbeen seeing someone else for a month,\u201d </i>and how he <i>\u201cdidn\u2019t love you anymore,\u201d</i> and that he <i>\u201cwished you the best and would always have love in his heart for you.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Hypocrite.</i></p><!-- more --><p>You\u2019d finished reading the text over again, the now three-quarters full bottle sitting precariously on your chest, and threw your phone against the uncomfortable twin mattress. You hated that you were wallowing in it, you hated that he made you cry, you hated that you felt like you didn\u2019t know what to do without him\u2014 boys shouldn\u2019t make you feel like that. You pushed yourself into more of a sitting position and lifted the bottle to your mouth, the room temperature alcohol slid down your throat and warmed your stomach. At least that was helping.</p><p>You jumped at the sound of knocking at your dorm room window, out of the corner of your eye you caught sight of a bright red suit and a familiar looking mask.</p><p>\u201cY/N, let me in!\u201d his voice was muffled by both the glass and the mask over his face. You stood and wiped your eyes before walking over to the window and sliding it open. Your spidey-suited friend, Peter, climbed his way through and landed not-so-gracefully on the floor. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered as his butt connected with the ugly carpet.</p><p>You stood over him for a second before returning to your bed. Peter stumbled back to his feet and pulled off his mask, his hair was messy and his face had a slight sheen that had been built up due to the stuffiness under the suit. </p><p>You felt the bed dip with his weight once he sat down next to you and you take another drink. And then another.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna talk to me or am I going to have to web that bottle to the other side of the room?\u201d you cradled the bottle close to your chest and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t <i>dare,\u201d</i> you slurred and squeezed it tighter against you. Peter rolled his eyes and you finally set it down. You pulled your legs up onto the bed and sat with your chin between your knees. \u201cHe,\u201d you start to say between hiccups. \u201cHe dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you could hear the shock in his voice. You leaned over and grabbed your still unlocked phone to give to him. Silence fell over the two of you as he read the lengthy paragraph. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you? What kind of shit is that?\u201d you shrugged and took yet another drink, Peter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N.\u201d</p><p><i><b>That fucking asshole.</b></i></p><p>You nodded, as tears started to form in your eyes again. There was a painful lump in your throat. \u201cThanks, Pete.\u201d</p><p>You felt his arm snake around your shoulders and you allowed yourself to collapse into him, sad sniffs and sobs escaped your lips as the two of you sat in silence, his hand rubbing your shoulder comfortingly. <i>You were so thankful for him.</i></p><p>Peter had to control himself. He wanted to get up and punch that asshole right in the face for hurting you. He knew you didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>You and Peter became fast friends during your first year of college. You came to ESU from out of state and didn\u2019t have any friends when you arrived, Peter\u2019s situation was similar, except that he was the only one of his friends that decided to stay in-state. The two of you met on move-in day and from then on you stuck by each other. </p><p>Peter also never liked your ex. You met him during your second semester of freshman year and it didn\u2019t take his spidey-senses to know that he was no good. But he didn\u2019t say anything. You were happy, and Peter liked seeing you happy. Even though it killed him every time he saw you together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the shit out of him,\u201d Peter piped up, trying to lighten the mood. You laughed and sniffled.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right, he\u2019ll probably just have an <i>unfortunate</i> fall down the stairs one day,\u201d you laughed again. Happy that you were starting to smile, Peter continued with his list of \u201caccidents\u201d that could befall him. \u201cOr, you know, his room will start to smell really bad because he <i>somehow</i> left a carton of milk out. Or he\u2019ll lose his key and get locked out of his dorm because they <i>somehow </i>got stuck on the ceiling\u2014\u201d </p><p>You shoved him and wiped your nose with the back of your arm, a small smile still on your face. You collected yourself for a moment then made a pathetic attempt to stand up, which resulted in you almost toppling over. Peter stood up and caught you by the shoulders. You moaned in protest as he sat you back down. </p><p>\u201cI want to get up\u2026\u201d you whined. Peter shook his head and leaned you against the wall. You hadn\u2019t realized he had left to get you water until he was back and putting it in your hands. He had somehow managed to change out of his suit and into normal clothes without you even noticing. You gratefully accepted the water and chugged it\u2014 not realizing how thirsty you actually were.</p><p>It was an ungraceful act, and water had managed to trickle down your chin and onto your clothes. Peter stood next to the bed and watched as you started to lay down. You were ready to close your eyes and sleep, but as soon as your head touched the pillow you felt your stomach start to churn. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you started, but you couldn\u2019t finish your sentence. The room was spinning and you knew you wouldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom. Luckily, he was one step ahead of you. Peter, trash can at the ready, got there just in time. Your throat and stomach were hot as you proceeded to expel all of the toxins and food you\u2019d consumed that day. You pulled back, your throat burning, cheeks hot with embarrassment, and felt your eyes well with tears again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said to him. \u201cThat\u2019s so fucking gross, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>You felt the rough surface of a paper towel on your chin as he cleaned you up. \u201cOh stop,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve stitched me up more times than I can count, the least I could do is help you through this,\u201d that was true. Perks of being friends with a med student: they need to practice suturing. Something Peter needed a lot of.</p><p>You smiled again and took the towel from him to finish the job. A terrible taste lingered in your mouth. </p><p>\u201cCan you, uh,\u201d you pointed at your shower caddy. Peter grabbed your toothbrush and toothpaste, holding them out to you for confirmation. You nodded and he helped you to the bathroom. You gripped the edge of the sink tightly and Peter stood at the sink next to yours to wash his hands.</p><p>\u201cYour guys\u2019 bathroom is really clean,\u201d he said once he\u2019d finished. He pulled back one of the shower curtains. He had never been in the bathroom on the girl\u2019s floors before, man he was jealous. \u201cNot really what I expected but still, must be nice.\u201d </p><p>You spat into the sink and looked at him. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, like\u2026 maybe a guy handing you hot towels\u2026 or like the Ritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up!\u201d you laughed. Peter smiled and took your hand to lead you back to your room. You tried to untie your shoes but immediately regretted it as you bent over. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he helped your shoes off and grabbed you some pajamas, which you took happily. <i>He was always so nice to you.</i></p><p>Peter looked around awkwardly. \u201cShould I, uh, go?\u201d he asked. He knew the boundaries, but you didn\u2019t want him to leave. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cJust um\u2026\u201d you looked for somewhere he could go, but you were trapped in a tiny dorm, it\u2019s not like he could just go to the other room. \u201cTurn around okay? And promise not to look.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and turned his back wordlessly. His head hung low, looking at his feet. You did the same. With your back to him, you began to get undressed\u2014 this should have felt awkward. You were best friends, something like seeing you naked could be a friendship-ender. But it wasn\u2019t. It felt safe, intimate, you were way more comfortable doing this around Peter than you ever were with your ex. </p><p>You pushed those thoughts from your mind and turned back around. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done.\u201d </p><p>Peter lifted his head and faced you, a goofy smile came to his face once he saw the shirt you were wearing. \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did that on purpose!\u201d you laughed and looked down at the bright red, extra-long shirt. He\u2019d grabbed you a pair of sleeping shorts and this t-shirt that you\u2019d gotten way before you\u2019d ever met him, before you\u2019d known his secret.</p><p>\u201cI just grabbed the first thing I saw! When did you get that?\u201d you shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man has always been my favorite superhero,\u201d Peter laughed and you glanced towards your bed, the desire for sleep growing ever stronger. You pulled back your duvet and climbed in. You heard the soft \u2018thunk\u2019 of him setting down the, thankfully now empty, trash can and pulled the covers up to your chin. </p><p>Your eyes grew heavier and heavier, and you were half asleep when you mumbled: \u201cPeter,\u201d</p><p>He turned around and saw that your eyes were closed. He was about to brush it off and head out the door when he heard you again. </p><p>\u201cPlease, stay,\u201d your speech slurred thanks to the mix of alcohol and sleep. \u201cAt least until I fall asleep,\u201d He looked at you for another minute before gently kicking off his shoes. He couldn\u2019t say no to you. He sat down at the edge of your bed and you curled your body tighter to make more room for him. His hand rested gently on your calf over the sheets and he leaned his head against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N,\u201d he said quietly as sleep began to tug at his eyes too. </p><p>+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+</p><p>You opened your eyes and were greeted by your too bright room. You\u2019d forgotten to close your curtains so the sunlight was streaming in, which would have been nice had it not been for your splitting headache. You sat up slowly, bringing your legs in so that you were sitting criss-cross-applesauce, and stretched, the sound of soft breathing caught your attention. There was Peter, his head tilted back in a way that couldn\u2019t be comfortable, his mouth slightly open, asleep against your wall. </p><p>He\u2019d stayed the whole time. </p><p>You leaned over and shook his shoulder gently, which made him jump a little as he sat up. You watched as he rolled his neck, trying to stretch out the ache that had started right above his spine.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you said quietly. His hair was matted down in the back, his eyes were twisted shut, his skin basically glowing in the morning sun. <i>You couldn\u2019t deny\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back and opened one eye to look at you. Your hair was slightly messy, your cheeks were tinted pink, your lips were\u2014 unknowingly\u2014 parted ever so slightly. <i><b>He couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 </b></i></p><p><i>You wanted to kiss him so badly. <br/><b>He wanted to kiss you so badly.</b></i></p><p>Your hand traveled down from his shoulder to his hand which had been planted on the surface of the bed. The two of you looked down and then back up at each other. The silence that permeated the room was heavy, and yet still comfortable. Everything unsaid, undone, hung in that silence. Slowly, you leaned forward, Peter did the same.</p><p>The kiss started out gentle, his soft lips barely pressing against yours, pulling away after a few seconds, testing the waters to make sure that this was okay. Then it deepened. He angled his body so that he could face you better, his weight resting on his knees, hands on your hips as he nipped gently at your bottom lip. The short, sharp sensation followed by the softness of his tongue made you whimper. Your hands flew around his neck and up into his hair as you uncrossed your legs.</p><p> He pushed himself closer to you, your legs on either side of his as the kiss deepened again. Tongue, teeth, and morning breath (which the two of you ignored as you were too caught up in other things.) You began to lay back slowly and pulled him down with you. His body on top of yours made you gasp again and it was your turn to take a bite of him. A low growl escaped his throat, a noise you never thought <i>Peter Parker </i>could make, and he moved from your lips to your jaw. Your hands gripped his back as he gently kissed down your neck. </p><p>\u201cIs this,\u201d he started, his lips hovering over the shell of your ear. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s great\u2014 Peter!\u201d his name came out in a moan as he sucked at the base of your jaw. <i>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</i> you gasped. You had no idea that was a sweet spot for you. Your ex had never paid attention to how your body responded. You tugged at his hair as he continued to lick and bite around your neck, making sure not to stay in one spot for too long so that he didn\u2019t leave a massive mark. </p><p>Somehow, you flipped him over. You straddled him as you brought your lips back down to his, and he happily parted them for you. You decided to follow what he\u2019d just done to you and kissed down his neck, biting and sucking until you heard him let out another deep growl. You lingered there, just above his collar bone. </p><p>\u201cF\u2014fuck!\u201d he whined. One hand made its way under the red fabric of your shirt and rested on the bare skin of your waist. \u201cY/N, oh my god.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him, his lips were pink and swollen as he let out a few faint gasps, his hair was starting to stick to his forehead. You loved seeing him like this, you wanted this to last forever. But something stopped you. You felt a slight pain, not physical, when you thought about the idea of going further. </p><p>You kissed back up to his lips and gave him one final peck before sitting up, guilt suddenly flowed through you. Peter sat up too, laying his weight on his elbows as you were still on top of him\u2014 which he didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked once he noticed you had looked down at your hands.</p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2026 you know \u2018go all the way.\u2019 not right now at least,\u201d Peter cocked his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s what you wanted\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I made you think that\u2014\u201d he reached up to cup your cheek, the soft pad of his thumb ran gently over your skin.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Y/N,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m okay with,\u201d he had a small smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 upset?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not! This,\u201d he said and gestured at you. \u201cIs enough.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him and leaned down to kiss him one more time\u2014 softer than before, your hand cradled his cheek. You pulled away and rested your forehead on his, this closeness you felt with Peter had been completely foreign until now. And you knew that you wouldn\u2019t feel it with anyone else.</p><p>You heard your phone chime and picked it up. It was a snap from your ex, against your better judgment you opened it. He had his arm wrapped around a blonde girl that you\u2019d never seen before, cheesy grins on both of their faces. </p><p><i>\u2018Streaks!!<i>\ud83d\udd25</i>\ud83d\udd25 Party tonight in N-building! Second floor!!!!!\u2019</i> it read. You grimaced. Peter got the same notification.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d he said. You shrugged and tossed your phone back on the bed before standing. Peter glanced at you and sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cShit! Sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he tapped his neck and you looked at yourself in your mirror. Right below your jaw, a purple mark started to bloom. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was being careful,\u201d he said shyly. You laughed and made your way over to him. You pulled down the collar of his shirt and saw his own deep hickey. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re even,\u201d you winked. Peter watched as you opened your closet to find something to wear. That asshole had no idea what he was missing with you. Peter wanted him to know it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his party. Let\u2019s go!\u201d you shook your head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! He deserves to see what he\u2019s missing. And it\u2019ll really piss him off to see that,\u201d he said and pointed at your neck. \u201cEspecially if he knows it was left by me.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged and he stood up to make his way over to you. His chin rested on your shoulder, arms around your waist. Your heart fluttered, he just made you feel so goddamn warm.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N. Let\u2019s stir some shit up.\u201d</p><p>You giggled at that and turned to face him, still in his grasp. \u201cAlright,\u201d you said, wrapping your arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p>",

You hated that you were wallowing in it, you hated that he made you cry, you hated that you felt like you didn\u2019t know what to do without him\u2014 boys shouldn\u2019t make you feel like that. You pushed yourself into more of a sitting position and lifted the bottle to your mouth, the room temperature alcohol slid down your throat and warmed your stomach. At least that was helping.</p><p>You jumped at the sound of knocking at your dorm room window, out of the corner of your eye you caught sight of a bright red suit and a familiar looking mask.</p><p>\u201cY/N, let me in!\u201d his voice was muffled by both the glass and the mask over his face. You stood and wiped your eyes before walking over to the window and sliding it open. Your spidey-suited friend, Peter, climbed his way through and landed not-so-gracefully on the floor. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered as his butt connected with the ugly carpet.</p><p>You stood over him for a second before returning to your bed. Peter stumbled back to his feet and pulled off his mask, his hair was messy and his face had a slight sheen that had been built up due to the stuffiness under the suit. </p><p>You felt the bed dip with his weight once he sat down next to you and you take another drink. And then another.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna talk to me or am I going to have to web that bottle to the other side of the room?\u201d you cradled the bottle close to your chest and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t <i>dare,\u201d</i> you slurred and squeezed it tighter against you. Peter rolled his eyes and you finally set it down. You pulled your legs up onto the bed and sat with your chin between your knees. \u201cHe,\u201d you start to say between hiccups. \u201cHe dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you could hear the shock in his voice. You leaned over and grabbed your still unlocked phone to give to him. Silence fell over the two of you as he read the lengthy paragraph. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you? What kind of shit is that?\u201d you shrugged and took yet another drink, Peter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N.\u201d</p><p><i><b>That fucking asshole.</b></i></p><p>You nodded, as tears started to form in your eyes again. There was a painful lump in your throat. \u201cThanks, Pete.\u201d</p><p>You felt his arm snake around your shoulders and you allowed yourself to collapse into him, sad sniffs and sobs escaped your lips as the two of you sat in silence, his hand rubbing your shoulder comfortingly. <i>You were so thankful for him.</i></p><p>Peter had to control himself. He wanted to get up and punch that asshole right in the face for hurting you. He knew you didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>You and Peter became fast friends during your first year of college. You came to ESU from out of state and didn\u2019t have any friends when you arrived, Peter\u2019s situation was similar, except that he was the only one of his friends that decided to stay in-state. The two of you met on move-in day and from then on you stuck by each other. </p><p>Peter also never liked your ex. You met him during your second semester of freshman year and it didn\u2019t take his spidey-senses to know that he was no good. But he didn\u2019t say anything. You were happy, and Peter liked seeing you happy. Even though it killed him every time he saw you together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the shit out of him,\u201d Peter piped up, trying to lighten the mood. You laughed and sniffled.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right, he\u2019ll probably just have an <i>unfortunate</i> fall down the stairs one day,\u201d you laughed again. Happy that you were starting to smile, Peter continued with his list of \u201caccidents\u201d that could befall him. \u201cOr, you know, his room will start to smell really bad because he <i>somehow</i> left a carton of milk out. Or he\u2019ll lose his key and get locked out of his dorm because they <i>somehow </i>got stuck on the ceiling\u2014\u201d </p><p>You shoved him and wiped your nose with the back of your arm, a small smile still on your face. You collected yourself for a moment then made a pathetic attempt to stand up, which resulted in you almost toppling over. Peter stood up and caught you by the shoulders. You moaned in protest as he sat you back down. </p><p>\u201cI want to get up\u2026\u201d you whined. Peter shook his head and leaned you against the wall. You hadn\u2019t realized he had left to get you water until he was back and putting it in your hands. He had somehow managed to change out of his suit and into normal clothes without you even noticing. You gratefully accepted the water and chugged it\u2014 not realizing how thirsty you actually were.</p><p>It was an ungraceful act, and water had managed to trickle down your chin and onto your clothes. Peter stood next to the bed and watched as you started to lay down. You were ready to close your eyes and sleep, but as soon as your head touched the pillow you felt your stomach start to churn. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you started, but you couldn\u2019t finish your sentence. The room was spinning and you knew you wouldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom. Luckily, he was one step ahead of you. Peter, trash can at the ready, got there just in time. Your throat and stomach were hot as you proceeded to expel all of the toxins and food you\u2019d consumed that day. You pulled back, your throat burning, cheeks hot with embarrassment, and felt your eyes well with tears again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said to him. \u201cThat\u2019s so fucking gross, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>You felt the rough surface of a paper towel on your chin as he cleaned you up. \u201cOh stop,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve stitched me up more times than I can count, the least I could do is help you through this,\u201d that was true. Perks of being friends with a med student: they need to practice suturing. Something Peter needed a lot of.</p><p>You smiled again and took the towel from him to finish the job. A terrible taste lingered in your mouth. </p><p>\u201cCan you, uh,\u201d you pointed at your shower caddy. Peter grabbed your toothbrush and toothpaste, holding them out to you for confirmation. You nodded and he helped you to the bathroom. You gripped the edge of the sink tightly and Peter stood at the sink next to yours to wash his hands.</p><p>\u201cYour guys\u2019 bathroom is really clean,\u201d he said once he\u2019d finished. He pulled back one of the shower curtains. He had never been in the bathroom on the girl\u2019s floors before, man he was jealous. \u201cNot really what I expected but still, must be nice.\u201d </p><p>You spat into the sink and looked at him. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, like\u2026 maybe a guy handing you hot towels\u2026 or like the Ritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up!\u201d you laughed. Peter smiled and took your hand to lead you back to your room. You tried to untie your shoes but immediately regretted it as you bent over. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he helped your shoes off and grabbed you some pajamas, which you took happily. <i>He was always so nice to you.</i></p><p>Peter looked around awkwardly. \u201cShould I, uh, go?\u201d he asked. He knew the boundaries, but you didn\u2019t want him to leave. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cJust um\u2026\u201d you looked for somewhere he could go, but you were trapped in a tiny dorm, it\u2019s not like he could just go to the other room. \u201cTurn around okay? And promise not to look.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and turned his back wordlessly. His head hung low, looking at his feet. You did the same. With your back to him, you began to get undressed\u2014 this should have felt awkward. You were best friends, something like seeing you naked could be a friendship-ender. But it wasn\u2019t. It felt safe, intimate, you were way more comfortable doing this around Peter than you ever were with your ex. </p><p>You pushed those thoughts from your mind and turned back around. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done.\u201d </p><p>Peter lifted his head and faced you, a goofy smile came to his face once he saw the shirt you were wearing. \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did that on purpose!\u201d you laughed and looked down at the bright red, extra-long shirt. He\u2019d grabbed you a pair of sleeping shorts and this t-shirt that you\u2019d gotten way before you\u2019d ever met him, before you\u2019d known his secret.</p><p>\u201cI just grabbed the first thing I saw! When did you get that?\u201d you shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man has always been my favorite superhero,\u201d Peter laughed and you glanced towards your bed, the desire for sleep growing ever stronger. You pulled back your duvet and climbed in. You heard the soft \u2018thunk\u2019 of him setting down the, thankfully now empty, trash can and pulled the covers up to your chin. </p><p>Your eyes grew heavier and heavier, and you were half asleep when you mumbled: \u201cPeter,\u201d</p><p>He turned around and saw that your eyes were closed. He was about to brush it off and head out the door when he heard you again. </p><p>\u201cPlease, stay,\u201d your speech slurred thanks to the mix of alcohol and sleep. \u201cAt least until I fall asleep,\u201d He looked at you for another minute before gently kicking off his shoes. He couldn\u2019t say no to you. He sat down at the edge of your bed and you curled your body tighter to make more room for him. His hand rested gently on your calf over the sheets and he leaned his head against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N,\u201d he said quietly as sleep began to tug at his eyes too. </p><p>+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+</p><p>You opened your eyes and were greeted by your too bright room. You\u2019d forgotten to close your curtains so the sunlight was streaming in, which would have been nice had it not been for your splitting headache. You sat up slowly, bringing your legs in so that you were sitting criss-cross-applesauce, and stretched, the sound of soft breathing caught your attention. There was Peter, his head tilted back in a way that couldn\u2019t be comfortable, his mouth slightly open, asleep against your wall. </p><p>He\u2019d stayed the whole time. </p><p>You leaned over and shook his shoulder gently, which made him jump a little as he sat up. You watched as he rolled his neck, trying to stretch out the ache that had started right above his spine.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you said quietly. His hair was matted down in the back, his eyes were twisted shut, his skin basically glowing in the morning sun. <i>You couldn\u2019t deny\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back and opened one eye to look at you. Your hair was slightly messy, your cheeks were tinted pink, your lips were\u2014 unknowingly\u2014 parted ever so slightly. <i><b>He couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 </b></i></p><p><i>You wanted to kiss him so badly. <br><b>He wanted to kiss you so badly.</b></i></p><p>Your hand traveled down from his shoulder to his hand which had been planted on the surface of the bed. The two of you looked down and then back up at each other. The silence that permeated the room was heavy, and yet still comfortable. Everything unsaid, undone, hung in that silence. Slowly, you leaned forward, Peter did the same.</p><p>The kiss started out gentle, his soft lips barely pressing against yours, pulling away after a few seconds, testing the waters to make sure that this was okay. Then it deepened. He angled his body so that he could face you better, his weight resting on his knees, hands on your hips as he nipped gently at your bottom lip. The short, sharp sensation followed by the softness of his tongue made you whimper. Your hands flew around his neck and up into his hair as you uncrossed your legs.</p><p> He pushed himself closer to you, your legs on either side of his as the kiss deepened again. Tongue, teeth, and morning breath (which the two of you ignored as you were too caught up in other things.) You began to lay back slowly and pulled him down with you. His body on top of yours made you gasp again and it was your turn to take a bite of him. A low growl escaped his throat, a noise you never thought <i>Peter Parker </i>could make, and he moved from your lips to your jaw. Your hands gripped his back as he gently kissed down your neck. </p><p>\u201cIs this,\u201d he started, his lips hovering over the shell of your ear. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s great\u2014 Peter!\u201d his name came out in a moan as he sucked at the base of your jaw. <i>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</i> you gasped. You had no idea that was a sweet spot for you. Your ex had never paid attention to how your body responded. You tugged at his hair as he continued to lick and bite around your neck, making sure not to stay in one spot for too long so that he didn\u2019t leave a massive mark. </p><p>Somehow, you flipped him over. You straddled him as you brought your lips back down to his, and he happily parted them for you. You decided to follow what he\u2019d just done to you and kissed down his neck, biting and sucking until you heard him let out another deep growl. You lingered there, just above his collar bone. </p><p>\u201cF\u2014fuck!\u201d he whined. One hand made its way under the red fabric of your shirt and rested on the bare skin of your waist. \u201cY/N, oh my god.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him, his lips were pink and swollen as he let out a few faint gasps, his hair was starting to stick to his forehead. You loved seeing him like this, you wanted this to last forever. But something stopped you. You felt a slight pain, not physical, when you thought about the idea of going further. </p><p>You kissed back up to his lips and gave him one final peck before sitting up, guilt suddenly flowed through you. Peter sat up too, laying his weight on his elbows as you were still on top of him\u2014 which he didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked once he noticed you had looked down at your hands.</p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2026 you know \u2018go all the way.\u2019 not right now at least,\u201d Peter cocked his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s what you wanted\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I made you think that\u2014\u201d he reached up to cup your cheek, the soft pad of his thumb ran gently over your skin.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Y/N,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m okay with,\u201d he had a small smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 upset?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not! This,\u201d he said and gestured at you. \u201cIs enough.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him and leaned down to kiss him one more time\u2014 softer than before, your hand cradled his cheek. You pulled away and rested your forehead on his, this closeness you felt with Peter had been completely foreign until now. And you knew that you wouldn\u2019t feel it with anyone else.</p><p>You heard your phone chime and picked it up. It was a snap from your ex, against your better judgment you opened it. He had his arm wrapped around a blonde girl that you\u2019d never seen before, cheesy grins on both of their faces. </p><p><i>\u2018Streaks!!<i>\ud83d\udd25</i>\ud83d\udd25 Party tonight in N-building! Second floor!!!!!\u2019</i> it read. You grimaced. Peter got the same notification.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d he said. You shrugged and tossed your phone back on the bed before standing. Peter glanced at you and sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cShit! Sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he tapped his neck and you looked at yourself in your mirror. Right below your jaw, a purple mark started to bloom. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was being careful,\u201d he said shyly. You laughed and made your way over to him. You pulled down the collar of his shirt and saw his own deep hickey. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re even,\u201d you winked. Peter watched as you opened your closet to find something to wear. That asshole had no idea what he was missing with you. Peter wanted him to know it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his party. Let\u2019s go!\u201d you shook your head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! He deserves to see what he\u2019s missing. And it\u2019ll really piss him off to see that,\u201d he said and pointed at your neck. \u201cEspecially if he knows it was left by me.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged and he stood up to make his way over to you. His chin rested on your shoulder, arms around your waist. Your heart fluttered, he just made you feel so goddamn warm.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N. Let\u2019s stir some shit up.\u201d</p><p>You giggled at that and turned to face him, still in his grasp. \u201cAlright,\u201d you said, wrapping your arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p></p>",

You were still awake\u2026 and very drunk. <i>Very</i> drunk\u2014 which is never a good state for you to be in. But that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re left alone, sad, on a Friday evening. Your roommate\u2019s family lived close to the ESU campus, so she\u2019d often go home for the weekend, most of your friends were home this weekend, but not you. You\u2019d rather cry yourself to sleep while drinking your secret stash of booze than go home right now.</p><p>Just hours previous to that very moment, you\u2019d gotten dumped. Via text. Why did it have to be text? This isn\u2019t high school, you were adults in college for christ\u2019s sake! Your now ex-boyfriend constructed a long and drawn out paragraph, spelling out how he\u2019d <i>\u201cbeen seeing someone else for a month,\u201d </i>and how he <i>\u201cdidn\u2019t love you anymore,\u201d</i> and that he <i>\u201cwished you the best and would always have love in his heart for you.\u201d </i></p><p><i>Hypocrite.</i></p>[[MORE]]<p>You\u2019d finished reading the text over again, the now three-quarters full bottle sitting precariously on your chest, and threw your phone against the uncomfortable twin mattress. You hated that you were wallowing in it, you hated that he made you cry, you hated that you felt like you didn\u2019t know what to do without him\u2014 boys shouldn\u2019t make you feel like that. You pushed yourself into more of a sitting position and lifted the bottle to your mouth, the room temperature alcohol slid down your throat and warmed your stomach. At least that was helping.</p><p>You jumped at the sound of knocking at your dorm room window, out of the corner of your eye you caught sight of a bright red suit and a familiar looking mask.</p><p>\u201cY/N, let me in!\u201d his voice was muffled by both the glass and the mask over his face. You stood and wiped your eyes before walking over to the window and sliding it open. Your spidey-suited friend, Peter, climbed his way through and landed not-so-gracefully on the floor. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered as his butt connected with the ugly carpet.</p><p>You stood over him for a second before returning to your bed. Peter stumbled back to his feet and pulled off his mask, his hair was messy and his face had a slight sheen that had been built up due to the stuffiness under the suit. </p><p>You felt the bed dip with his weight once he sat down next to you and you take another drink. And then another.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna talk to me or am I going to have to web that bottle to the other side of the room?\u201d you cradled the bottle close to your chest and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t <i>dare,\u201d</i> you slurred and squeezed it tighter against you. Peter rolled his eyes and you finally set it down. You pulled your legs up onto the bed and sat with your chin between your knees. \u201cHe,\u201d you start to say between hiccups. \u201cHe dumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you could hear the shock in his voice. You leaned over and grabbed your still unlocked phone to give to him. Silence fell over the two of you as he read the lengthy paragraph. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you? What kind of shit is that?\u201d you shrugged and took yet another drink, Peter sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Y/N.\u201d</p><p><i><b>That fucking asshole.</b></i></p><p>You nodded, as tears started to form in your eyes again. There was a painful lump in your throat. \u201cThanks, Pete.\u201d</p><p>You felt his arm snake around your shoulders and you allowed yourself to collapse into him, sad sniffs and sobs escaped your lips as the two of you sat in silence, his hand rubbing your shoulder comfortingly. <i>You were so thankful for him.</i></p><p>Peter had to control himself. He wanted to get up and punch that asshole right in the face for hurting you. He knew you didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>You and Peter became fast friends during your first year of college. You came to ESU from out of state and didn\u2019t have any friends when you arrived, Peter\u2019s situation was similar, except that he was the only one of his friends that decided to stay in-state. The two of you met on move-in day and from then on you stuck by each other. </p><p>Peter also never liked your ex. You met him during your second semester of freshman year and it didn\u2019t take his spidey-senses to know that he was no good. But he didn\u2019t say anything. You were happy, and Peter liked seeing you happy. Even though it killed him every time he saw you together. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the shit out of him,\u201d Peter piped up, trying to lighten the mood. You laughed and sniffled.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d you said. </p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right, he\u2019ll probably just have an <i>unfortunate</i> fall down the stairs one day,\u201d you laughed again. Happy that you were starting to smile, Peter continued with his list of \u201caccidents\u201d that could befall him. \u201cOr, you know, his room will start to smell really bad because he <i>somehow</i> left a carton of milk out. Or he\u2019ll lose his key and get locked out of his dorm because they <i>somehow </i>got stuck on the ceiling\u2014\u201d </p><p>You shoved him and wiped your nose with the back of your arm, a small smile still on your face. You collected yourself for a moment then made a pathetic attempt to stand up, which resulted in you almost toppling over. Peter stood up and caught you by the shoulders. You moaned in protest as he sat you back down. </p><p>\u201cI want to get up\u2026\u201d you whined. Peter shook his head and leaned you against the wall. You hadn\u2019t realized he had left to get you water until he was back and putting it in your hands. He had somehow managed to change out of his suit and into normal clothes without you even noticing. You gratefully accepted the water and chugged it\u2014 not realizing how thirsty you actually were.</p><p>It was an ungraceful act, and water had managed to trickle down your chin and onto your clothes. Peter stood next to the bed and watched as you started to lay down. You were ready to close your eyes and sleep, but as soon as your head touched the pillow you felt your stomach start to churn. </p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d you started, but you couldn\u2019t finish your sentence. The room was spinning and you knew you wouldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom. Luckily, he was one step ahead of you. Peter, trash can at the ready, got there just in time. Your throat and stomach were hot as you proceeded to expel all of the toxins and food you\u2019d consumed that day. You pulled back, your throat burning, cheeks hot with embarrassment, and felt your eyes well with tears again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you said to him. \u201cThat\u2019s so fucking gross, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>You felt the rough surface of a paper towel on your chin as he cleaned you up. \u201cOh stop,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve stitched me up more times than I can count, the least I could do is help you through this,\u201d that was true. Perks of being friends with a med student: they need to practice suturing. Something Peter needed a lot of.</p><p>You smiled again and took the towel from him to finish the job. A terrible taste lingered in your mouth. </p><p>\u201cCan you, uh,\u201d you pointed at your shower caddy. Peter grabbed your toothbrush and toothpaste, holding them out to you for confirmation. You nodded and he helped you to the bathroom. You gripped the edge of the sink tightly and Peter stood at the sink next to yours to wash his hands.</p><p>\u201cYour guys\u2019 bathroom is really clean,\u201d he said once he\u2019d finished. He pulled back one of the shower curtains. He had never been in the bathroom on the girl\u2019s floors before, man he was jealous. \u201cNot really what I expected but still, must be nice.\u201d </p><p>You spat into the sink and looked at him. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, like\u2026 maybe a guy handing you hot towels\u2026 or like the Ritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up!\u201d you laughed. Peter smiled and took your hand to lead you back to your room. You tried to untie your shoes but immediately regretted it as you bent over. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he helped your shoes off and grabbed you some pajamas, which you took happily. <i>He was always so nice to you.</i></p><p>Peter looked around awkwardly. \u201cShould I, uh, go?\u201d he asked. He knew the boundaries, but you didn\u2019t want him to leave. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cJust um\u2026\u201d you looked for somewhere he could go, but you were trapped in a tiny dorm, it\u2019s not like he could just go to the other room. \u201cTurn around okay? And promise not to look.\u201d </p><p>He nodded and turned his back wordlessly. His head hung low, looking at his feet. You did the same. With your back to him, you began to get undressed\u2014 this should have felt awkward. You were best friends, something like seeing you naked could be a friendship-ender. But it wasn\u2019t. It felt safe, intimate, you were way more comfortable doing this around Peter than you ever were with your ex. </p><p>You pushed those thoughts from your mind and turned back around. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m done.\u201d </p><p>Peter lifted his head and faced you, a goofy smile came to his face once he saw the shirt you were wearing. \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did that on purpose!\u201d you laughed and looked down at the bright red, extra-long shirt. He\u2019d grabbed you a pair of sleeping shorts and this t-shirt that you\u2019d gotten way before you\u2019d ever met him, before you\u2019d known his secret.</p><p>\u201cI just grabbed the first thing I saw! When did you get that?\u201d you shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSpider-Man has always been my favorite superhero,\u201d Peter laughed and you glanced towards your bed, the desire for sleep growing ever stronger. You pulled back your duvet and climbed in. You heard the soft \u2018thunk\u2019 of him setting down the, thankfully now empty, trash can and pulled the covers up to your chin. </p><p>Your eyes grew heavier and heavier, and you were half asleep when you mumbled: \u201cPeter,\u201d</p><p>He turned around and saw that your eyes were closed. He was about to brush it off and head out the door when he heard you again. </p><p>\u201cPlease, stay,\u201d your speech slurred thanks to the mix of alcohol and sleep. \u201cAt least until I fall asleep,\u201d He looked at you for another minute before gently kicking off his shoes. He couldn\u2019t say no to you. He sat down at the edge of your bed and you curled your body tighter to make more room for him. His hand rested gently on your calf over the sheets and he leaned his head against the wall. </p><p>\u201cOf course, Y/N,\u201d he said quietly as sleep began to tug at his eyes too. </p><p>+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+</p><p>You opened your eyes and were greeted by your too bright room. You\u2019d forgotten to close your curtains so the sunlight was streaming in, which would have been nice had it not been for your splitting headache. You sat up slowly, bringing your legs in so that you were sitting criss-cross-applesauce, and stretched, the sound of soft breathing caught your attention. There was Peter, his head tilted back in a way that couldn\u2019t be comfortable, his mouth slightly open, asleep against your wall. </p><p>He\u2019d stayed the whole time. </p><p>You leaned over and shook his shoulder gently, which made him jump a little as he sat up. You watched as he rolled his neck, trying to stretch out the ache that had started right above his spine.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d you said quietly. His hair was matted down in the back, his eyes were twisted shut, his skin basically glowing in the morning sun. <i>You couldn\u2019t deny\u2026 </i></p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said back and opened one eye to look at you. Your hair was slightly messy, your cheeks were tinted pink, your lips were\u2014 unknowingly\u2014 parted ever so slightly. <i><b>He couldn\u2019t help it\u2026 </b></i></p><p><i>You wanted to kiss him so badly. <br><b>He wanted to kiss you so badly.</b></i></p><p>Your hand traveled down from his shoulder to his hand which had been planted on the surface of the bed. The two of you looked down and then back up at each other. The silence that permeated the room was heavy, and yet still comfortable. Everything unsaid, undone, hung in that silence. Slowly, you leaned forward, Peter did the same.</p><p>The kiss started out gentle, his soft lips barely pressing against yours, pulling away after a few seconds, testing the waters to make sure that this was okay. Then it deepened. He angled his body so that he could face you better, his weight resting on his knees, hands on your hips as he nipped gently at your bottom lip. The short, sharp sensation followed by the softness of his tongue made you whimper. Your hands flew around his neck and up into his hair as you uncrossed your legs.</p><p> He pushed himself closer to you, your legs on either side of his as the kiss deepened again. Tongue, teeth, and morning breath (which the two of you ignored as you were too caught up in other things.) You began to lay back slowly and pulled him down with you. His body on top of yours made you gasp again and it was your turn to take a bite of him. A low growl escaped his throat, a noise you never thought <i>Peter Parker </i>could make, and he moved from your lips to your jaw. Your hands gripped his back as he gently kissed down your neck. </p><p>\u201cIs this,\u201d he started, his lips hovering over the shell of your ear. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d you nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s great\u2014 Peter!\u201d his name came out in a moan as he sucked at the base of your jaw. <i>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</i> you gasped. You had no idea that was a sweet spot for you. Your ex had never paid attention to how your body responded. You tugged at his hair as he continued to lick and bite around your neck, making sure not to stay in one spot for too long so that he didn\u2019t leave a massive mark. </p><p>Somehow, you flipped him over. You straddled him as you brought your lips back down to his, and he happily parted them for you. You decided to follow what he\u2019d just done to you and kissed down his neck, biting and sucking until you heard him let out another deep growl. You lingered there, just above his collar bone. </p><p>\u201cF\u2014fuck!\u201d he whined. One hand made its way under the red fabric of your shirt and rested on the bare skin of your waist. \u201cY/N, oh my god.\u201d</p><p>You looked up at him, his lips were pink and swollen as he let out a few faint gasps, his hair was starting to stick to his forehead. You loved seeing him like this, you wanted this to last forever. But something stopped you. You felt a slight pain, not physical, when you thought about the idea of going further. </p><p>You kissed back up to his lips and gave him one final peck before sitting up, guilt suddenly flowed through you. Peter sat up too, laying his weight on his elbows as you were still on top of him\u2014 which he didn\u2019t mind. </p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked once he noticed you had looked down at your hands.</p><p>\u201cI um, I don\u2019t think I can\u2026 you know \u2018go all the way.\u2019 not right now at least,\u201d Peter cocked his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s what you wanted\u2026 I\u2019m sorry if I made you think that\u2014\u201d he reached up to cup your cheek, the soft pad of his thumb ran gently over your skin.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Y/N,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m okay with,\u201d he had a small smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 upset?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course not! This,\u201d he said and gestured at you. \u201cIs enough.\u201d</p><p>You smiled back at him and leaned down to kiss him one more time\u2014 softer than before, your hand cradled his cheek. You pulled away and rested your forehead on his, this closeness you felt with Peter had been completely foreign until now. And you knew that you wouldn\u2019t feel it with anyone else.</p><p>You heard your phone chime and picked it up. It was a snap from your ex, against your better judgment you opened it. He had his arm wrapped around a blonde girl that you\u2019d never seen before, cheesy grins on both of their faces. </p><p><i>\u2018Streaks!!<i>\ud83d\udd25</i>\ud83d\udd25 Party tonight in N-building! Second floor!!!!!\u2019</i> it read. You grimaced. Peter got the same notification.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d he said. You shrugged and tossed your phone back on the bed before standing. Peter glanced at you and sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cShit! Sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he tapped his neck and you looked at yourself in your mirror. Right below your jaw, a purple mark started to bloom. </p><p>\u201cI thought I was being careful,\u201d he said shyly. You laughed and made your way over to him. You pulled down the collar of his shirt and saw his own deep hickey. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re even,\u201d you winked. Peter watched as you opened your closet to find something to wear. That asshole had no idea what he was missing with you. Peter wanted him to know it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his party. Let\u2019s go!\u201d you shook your head at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! He deserves to see what he\u2019s missing. And it\u2019ll really piss him off to see that,\u201d he said and pointed at your neck. \u201cEspecially if he knows it was left by me.\u201d</p><p>You shrugged and he stood up to make his way over to you. His chin rested on your shoulder, arms around your waist. Your heart fluttered, he just made you feel so goddamn warm.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Y/N. Let\u2019s stir some shit up.\u201d</p><p>You giggled at that and turned to face him, still in his grasp. \u201cAlright,\u201d you said, wrapping your arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p></p>",

You pulled your legs up onto the bed and sat with your chin between your knees. &ldquo;He,&rdquo; you start to say between hiccups. &ldquo;He dumped me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you could hear the shock in his voice. You leaned over and grabbed your still unlocked phone to give to him. Silence fell over the two of you as he read the lengthy paragraph. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always love you? What kind of shit is that?&rdquo; you shrugged and took yet another drink, Peter sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p><i><b>That fucking asshole.</b></i></p><p>You nodded, as tears started to form in your eyes again. There was a painful lump in your throat. &ldquo;Thanks, Pete.&rdquo;</p><p>You felt his arm snake around your shoulders and you allowed yourself to collapse into him, sad sniffs and sobs escaped your lips as the two of you sat in silence, his hand rubbing your shoulder comfortingly. <i>You were so thankful for him.</i></p><p>Peter had to control himself. He wanted to get up and punch that asshole right in the face for hurting you. He knew you didn&rsquo;t deserve that.</p><p>You and Peter became fast friends during your first year of college. You came to ESU from out of state and didn&rsquo;t have any friends when you arrived, Peter&rsquo;s situation was similar, except that he was the only one of his friends that decided to stay in-state. The two of you met on move-in day and from then on you stuck by each other. </p><p>Peter also never liked your ex. You met him during your second semester of freshman year and it didn&rsquo;t take his spidey-senses to know that he was no good. But he didn&rsquo;t say anything. You were happy, and Peter liked seeing you happy. Even though it killed him every time he saw you together. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to beat the shit out of him,&rdquo; Peter piped up, trying to lighten the mood. You laughed and sniffled.</p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; you said. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah you&rsquo;re right, he&rsquo;ll probably just have an <i>unfortunate</i> fall down the stairs one day,&rdquo; you laughed again. Happy that you were starting to smile, Peter continued with his list of &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; that could befall him. &ldquo;Or, you know, his room will start to smell really bad because he <i>somehow</i> left a carton of milk out. Or he&rsquo;ll lose his key and get locked out of his dorm because they <i>somehow </i>got stuck on the ceiling&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>You shoved him and wiped your nose with the back of your arm, a small smile still on your face. You collected yourself for a moment then made a pathetic attempt to stand up, which resulted in you almost toppling over. Peter stood up and caught you by the shoulders. You moaned in protest as he sat you back down. </p><p>&ldquo;I want to get up&hellip;&rdquo; you whined. Peter shook his head and leaned you against the wall. You hadn&rsquo;t realized he had left to get you water until he was back and putting it in your hands. He had somehow managed to change out of his suit and into normal clothes without you even noticing. You gratefully accepted the water and chugged it&mdash; not realizing how thirsty you actually were.</p><p>It was an ungraceful act, and water had managed to trickle down your chin and onto your clothes. Peter stood next to the bed and watched as you started to lay down. You were ready to close your eyes and sleep, but as soon as your head touched the pillow you felt your stomach start to churn. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; you started, but you couldn&rsquo;t finish your sentence. The room was spinning and you knew you wouldn&rsquo;t make it to the bathroom. Luckily, he was one step ahead of you. Peter, trash can at the ready, got there just in time. Your throat and stomach were hot as you proceeded to expel all of the toxins and food you&rsquo;d consumed that day. You pulled back, your throat burning, cheeks hot with embarrassment, and felt your eyes well with tears again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; you said to him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so fucking gross, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>You felt the rough surface of a paper towel on your chin as he cleaned you up. &ldquo;Oh stop,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stitched me up more times than I can count, the least I could do is help you through this,&rdquo; that was true. Perks of being friends with a med student: they need to practice suturing. Something Peter needed a lot of.</p><p>You smiled again and took the towel from him to finish the job. A terrible taste lingered in your mouth. </p><p>&ldquo;Can you, uh,&rdquo; you pointed at your shower caddy. Peter grabbed your toothbrush and toothpaste, holding them out to you for confirmation. You nodded and he helped you to the bathroom. You gripped the edge of the sink tightly and Peter stood at the sink next to yours to wash his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Your guys&rsquo; bathroom is really clean,&rdquo; he said once he&rsquo;d finished. He pulled back one of the shower curtains. He had never been in the bathroom on the girl&rsquo;s floors before, man he was jealous. &ldquo;Not really what I expected but still, must be nice.&rdquo; </p><p>You spat into the sink and looked at him. &ldquo;What did you expect?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I dunno, like&hellip; maybe a guy handing you hot towels&hellip; or like the Ritz.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut up!&rdquo; you laughed. Peter smiled and took your hand to lead you back to your room. You tried to untie your shoes but immediately regretted it as you bent over. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he helped your shoes off and grabbed you some pajamas, which you took happily. <i>He was always so nice to you.</i></p><p>Peter looked around awkwardly. &ldquo;Should I, uh, go?&rdquo; he asked. He knew the boundaries, but you didn&rsquo;t want him to leave. Not yet.</p><p>&ldquo;Just um&hellip;&rdquo; you looked for somewhere he could go, but you were trapped in a tiny dorm, it&rsquo;s not like he could just go to the other room. &ldquo;Turn around okay? And promise not to look.&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded and turned his back wordlessly. His head hung low, looking at his feet. You did the same. With your back to him, you began to get undressed&mdash; this should have felt awkward. You were best friends, something like seeing you naked could be a friendship-ender. But it wasn&rsquo;t. It felt safe, intimate, you were way more comfortable doing this around Peter than you ever were with your ex. </p><p>You pushed those thoughts from your mind and turned back around. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter lifted his head and faced you, a goofy smile came to his face once he saw the shirt you were wearing. &ldquo;The Amazing Spider-Man, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you did that on purpose!&rdquo; you laughed and looked down at the bright red, extra-long shirt. He&rsquo;d grabbed you a pair of sleeping shorts and this t-shirt that you&rsquo;d gotten way before you&rsquo;d ever met him, before you&rsquo;d known his secret.</p><p>&ldquo;I just grabbed the first thing I saw! When did you get that?&rdquo; you shrugged.</p><p>&ldquo;Spider-Man has always been my favorite superhero,&rdquo; Peter laughed and you glanced towards your bed, the desire for sleep growing ever stronger. You pulled back your duvet and climbed in. You heard the soft &lsquo;thunk&rsquo; of him setting down the, thankfully now empty, trash can and pulled the covers up to your chin. </p><p>Your eyes grew heavier and heavier, and you were half asleep when you mumbled: &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo;</p><p>He turned around and saw that your eyes were closed. He was about to brush it off and head out the door when he heard you again. </p><p>&ldquo;Please, stay,&rdquo; your speech slurred thanks to the mix of alcohol and sleep. &ldquo;At least until I fall asleep,&rdquo; He looked at you for another minute before gently kicking off his shoes. He couldn&rsquo;t say no to you. He sat down at the edge of your bed and you curled your body tighter to make more room for him. His hand rested gently on your calf over the sheets and he leaned his head against the wall. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Y/N,&rdquo; he said quietly as sleep began to tug at his eyes too. </p><p>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+</p><p>You opened your eyes and were greeted by your too bright room. You&rsquo;d forgotten to close your curtains so the sunlight was streaming in, which would have been nice had it not been for your splitting headache. You sat up slowly, bringing your legs in so that you were sitting criss-cross-applesauce, and stretched, the sound of soft breathing caught your attention. There was Peter, his head tilted back in a way that couldn&rsquo;t be comfortable, his mouth slightly open, asleep against your wall. </p><p>He&rsquo;d stayed the whole time. </p><p>You leaned over and shook his shoulder gently, which made him jump a little as he sat up. You watched as he rolled his neck, trying to stretch out the ache that had started right above his spine.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; you said quietly. His hair was matted down in the back, his eyes were twisted shut, his skin basically glowing in the morning sun. <i>You couldn&rsquo;t deny&hellip; </i></p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said back and opened one eye to look at you. Your hair was slightly messy, your cheeks were tinted pink, your lips were&mdash; unknowingly&mdash; parted ever so slightly. <i><b>He couldn&rsquo;t help it&hellip; </b></i></p><p><i>You wanted to kiss him so badly. <br /><b>He wanted to kiss you so badly.</b></i></p><p>Your hand traveled down from his shoulder to his hand which had been planted on the surface of the bed. The two of you looked down and then back up at each other. The silence that permeated the room was heavy, and yet still comfortable. Everything unsaid, undone, hung in that silence. Slowly, you leaned forward, Peter did the same.</p><p>The kiss started out gentle, his soft lips barely pressing against yours, pulling away after a few seconds, testing the waters to make sure that this was okay. Then it deepened. He angled his body so that he could face you better, his weight resting on his knees, hands on your hips as he nipped gently at your bottom lip. The short, sharp sensation followed by the softness of his tongue made you whimper. Your hands flew around his neck and up into his hair as you uncrossed your legs.</p><p> He pushed himself closer to you, your legs on either side of his as the kiss deepened again. Tongue, teeth, and morning breath (which the two of you ignored as you were too caught up in other things.) You began to lay back slowly and pulled him down with you. His body on top of yours made you gasp again and it was your turn to take a bite of him. A low growl escaped his throat, a noise you never thought <i>Peter Parker </i>could make, and he moved from your lips to your jaw. Your hands gripped his back as he gently kissed down your neck. </p><p>&ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; he started, his lips hovering over the shell of your ear. &ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo; you nodded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s great&mdash; Peter!&rdquo; his name came out in a moan as he sucked at the base of your jaw. <i>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</i> you gasped. You had no idea that was a sweet spot for you. Your ex had never paid attention to how your body responded. You tugged at his hair as he continued to lick and bite around your neck, making sure not to stay in one spot for too long so that he didn&rsquo;t leave a massive mark. </p><p>Somehow, you flipped him over. You straddled him as you brought your lips back down to his, and he happily parted them for you. You decided to follow what he&rsquo;d just done to you and kissed down his neck, biting and sucking until you heard him let out another deep growl. You lingered there, just above his collar bone. </p><p>&ldquo;F&mdash;fuck!&rdquo; he whined. One hand made its way under the red fabric of your shirt and rested on the bare skin of your waist. &ldquo;Y/N, oh my god.&rdquo;</p><p>You looked up at him, his lips were pink and swollen as he let out a few faint gasps, his hair was starting to stick to his forehead. You loved seeing him like this, you wanted this to last forever. But something stopped you. You felt a slight pain, not physical, when you thought about the idea of going further. </p><p>You kissed back up to his lips and gave him one final peck before sitting up, guilt suddenly flowed through you. Peter sat up too, laying his weight on his elbows as you were still on top of him&mdash; which he didn&rsquo;t mind. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked once he noticed you had looked down at your hands.</p><p>&ldquo;I um, I don&rsquo;t think I can&hellip; you know &lsquo;go all the way.&rsquo; not right now at least,&rdquo; Peter cocked his head to the side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if that&rsquo;s what you wanted&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry if I made you think that&mdash;&rdquo; he reached up to cup your cheek, the soft pad of his thumb ran gently over your skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you want, Y/N,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay with,&rdquo; he had a small smile on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&hellip; upset?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Of course not! This,&rdquo; he said and gestured at you. &ldquo;Is enough.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled back at him and leaned down to kiss him one more time&mdash; softer than before, your hand cradled his cheek. You pulled away and rested your forehead on his, this closeness you felt with Peter had been completely foreign until now. And you knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t feel it with anyone else.</p><p>You heard your phone chime and picked it up. It was a snap from your ex, against your better judgment you opened it. He had his arm wrapped around a blonde girl that you&rsquo;d never seen before, cheesy grins on both of their faces. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Streaks!!<i>&#128293;</i>&#128293; Party tonight in N-building! Second floor!!!!!&rsquo;</i> it read. You grimaced. Peter got the same notification.</p><p>&ldquo;What a dick,&rdquo; he said. You shrugged and tossed your phone back on the bed before standing. Peter glanced at you and sucked in a sharp breath. &ldquo;Shit! Sorry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he tapped his neck and you looked at yourself in your mirror. Right below your jaw, a purple mark started to bloom. </p><p>&ldquo;I thought I was being careful,&rdquo; he said shyly. You laughed and made your way over to him. You pulled down the collar of his shirt and saw his own deep hickey. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, we&rsquo;re even,&rdquo; you winked. Peter watched as you opened your closet to find something to wear. That asshole had no idea what he was missing with you. Peter wanted him to know it.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To his party. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; you shook your head at him.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re high.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious! He deserves to see what he&rsquo;s missing. And it&rsquo;ll really piss him off to see that,&rdquo; he said and pointed at your neck. &ldquo;Especially if he knows it was left by me.&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged and he stood up to make his way over to you. His chin rested on your shoulder, arms around your waist. Your heart fluttered, he just made you feel so goddamn warm.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Y/N. Let&rsquo;s stir some shit up.&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled at that and turned to face him, still in his grasp. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; you said, wrapping your arms around his neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in.&rdquo;</p></p>",

Patiently, you and your best friend MJ waited for the rest of your classmates to leave before gathering your belongings.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you still cool with sleeping over this weekend, Y/N?\u201d MJ asked as you two walked up to your side-by-side lockers.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! I\u2019ve been so busy lately. It\u2019s like all of the school events happen in the last month of school. Principal Morita has had me booked solid taking pictures.\u201d You were shoving books in your locker aimlessly as tiredness was settling in your bones. </p><!-- more --><p>MJ slammed her locker and looked at you with excitement. \u201cWell we\u2019re not going to worry about that this weekend. We\u2019re going to stock up on junk food, the guys are going to come over, and forget all about anything school related!\u201d </p><p>Your heart picked up slightly at the thought of seeing Peter tonight. You hadn\u2019t seen him all day so it made you even more excited. But you kept your face devoid of emotion in order to keep your crush on Peter Parker to yourself. You hadn\u2019t told MJ and you weren\u2019t planning on letting it slip in the school hallway. </p><p>MJ didn\u2019t seem to notice your change in demeanor, instead she snatched your hand and shook it, squealing with you for a minute. Then she stopped and looked around, making sure no one had seen her. You giggled energetically and tangled your arm with hers. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, you dork!\u201d </p><p>~~~ </p><p>The windows were wide open to let the breeze flow through the room and MJ had the music cranked to an ungodly level. The two of you had changed into your pajamas and were dancing around the room, a thin layer of sweat on your skin. </p><p>It felt amazing to escape the strain of your current lifestyle even for just a few hours. MJ had forced you to promise that you wouldn\u2019t use your camera for anything professional for the whole weekend and it hadn\u2019t taken much to accept that stipulation. </p><p><i>Knock knock</i>. MJ was lost in the music so you swayed your way to the front door, half expecting the pizza delivery boy. You swung the door open and froze in your spot as you came face to face with chocolate brown eyes, messy curls, and perfectly pouty lips. He looked adorable in a Stark Industries t-shirt that fit him wonderfully. </p><p>Instinctively, you reached up to tame your hair that had tangled into a hornets nest during your dance session. It was evident that it was a lost cause so you diverted to straightening your tank top and shorts instead. </p><p>Peter watched you with fascination and your stomach was erupting with butterflies as his gaze traveled along your face. Ned kept looking back and forth between the two of you, unaware of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N. What have you and MJ been up too?\u201d Ned broke in at last. </p><p>You turned your focus to Ned, remembering that he was here too. \u201cHey, Ned. Um, just been listening to some music while we waited for the pizza.\u201d You gave Peter a small smile. \u201cI got extra pepperoni for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, awesome! Thanks, Y/N/N, you\u2019re the best.\u201d Peter exclaimed and you beamed from being praised.<br/></p><p>The boys crowded their way into the living room and plopped down onto the couch in their usual places. Trying to act as casual as possible, you sank into the place right next to Peter and tucked your feet under you. It was impossible to ignore that his hand was just inches from your knee. One little bump and his long fingers could be on your skin. </p><p>\u201cWhat movie do you guys want to start with?\u201d MJ asked from the floor, her body turned just enough to acknowledge the group. </p><p>Ned bounced slightly, \u201cLet\u2019s watch a scary movie!\u201d </p><p>The rest of the group agreed easily but you groaned loudly. \u201cNot another scary movie, you guys. I\u2019ll be up all night.\u201d </p><p>Peter leaned over, his shoulder bumping into yours. You were hyper-sensitive to the feeling of his shoulder against yours. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything get you. You can hold my hand if you get scared.\u201d </p><p>Goosebumps speckled your skin in an instant. He was watching you with that comforting gaze that always made you feel protected. You slowly nodded and his eyes glistened with delight. You bit your lip nervously, dying to press your mouth to his, instead you fell backwards against the fluffy pillow beside you. </p><p>Another knock at the door interrupted the chatter and MJ jumped up to answer it. </p><p>\u201cSomeone get the drinks, I\u2019ll get the pizza.\u201d She called as she ran out of the room. You moved to get up at the same time as Peter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get everything.\u201d He offered when you gave him a weird look. A small flutter went through your body as he motioned for you to lead the way. </p><p>Your head was buried in the fridge when you recognized the faint tune of your cell alarm. You glanced around to see it lying on the kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cCan you get that, Pete? It\u2019s probably just my alarm.\u201d And you returned to pulling out different sodas from the rack. </p><p>\u201cSure, no problem&hellip;\u201d His voice trailed off. </p><p>Silence hung over the room like a blanket and you looked up to find him staring at your phone screen. \u201cUm, are you okay? Pete?\u201d </p><p><b>\u201cAm I your lockscreen?\u201d </b></p><p>You swallowed thickly. It had completely slipped your mind that you had made him your lock screen a few weeks ago. You had been on your way to take pictures for the Robotics Competition when you had seen him in the hallway talking to a classmate. He just looked so happy and free that you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from capturing the moment. </p><p>Now, he was standing in front of you, barely more than a step away, waiting for an answer. You wondered if he could hear the blood rushing in your ears or the thudding of your heart inside your chest. </p><p>\u201cUm. Well, yes. I just love the picture and I like to have things I like for my wallpaper&hellip;\u201d Your feet had suddenly become more interesting to you in the last 15 seconds. </p><p>\u201cAnd you like me?\u201d His voice was soft. </p><p>All you could do was nod like a child who was scared to be scolded. </p><p>You were surprised by a hand tilting your chin up, and you lifted your eyes to meet his. Shivers were running down your spine as Peter smiled sweetly down at you. He leaned forward, his nose brushing against yours, and your breath was caught in your throat. Was this really happening? </p><p>He hesitated in that spot, \u201cI like you too.\u201d Lips rubbing against each other as he said the words. </p><p>You lost all sensibility in that moment. You wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled him the rest of the way. He made a little <i>oof</i> of surprise and placed his hands on your waist instantaneously. </p><p>You and Peter were pushing and pulling against each other like fuel to a fire. His hands were pressed to the low spot of your back and you were playing with the small curls at the base of his neck. His lips felt calming and electric as they moved against yours. </p><p>Peter had turned and pinned you against the counter, deepening the kiss, and the thumping of his heart was echoing in your chest. His body was flush against yours and the heat was rushing to your head. The primal instinct within you was dying to keep going, unrelenting to let Peter out of your grasp. But the practical side of you was telling you that this was only your first kiss. The first of many, you hoped.</p><p>The need for air overtook the need for passion and you broke away. Peter was panting heavily, his breath washing over you. Without thinking, you stood on your tiptoes and pulled his lower lip in between your teeth and then let it snap back. Peter groaned and rested his forehead against yours. </p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful. God, I could kiss you all night.\u201d The words were husky with adoration. </p><p>You giggled like a schoolgirl and rubbed your nose against his. \u201cI think MJ and Ned might think something was up.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flicked to the doorway and laughed an airy laugh. \u201cI think they may already know.\u201d </p><p>You turned your head quickly to see MJ and Ned standing in the doorway, knowing smirks on their face. A blush tipped your cheeks and you tucked in closer to Peter\u2019s body, your cheek placed against his neck. </p><p>\u201cYou owe me five bucks, Ned.\u201d MJ held her hand and Ned grumbled as he dug around in his pockets. </p><p>\u201cAh man, you two couldn\u2019t have waited two more weeks. I needed that.\u201d Ned hung his head and headed back into the living room. MJ shot you an annoyingly smug grin and disappeared to follow Ned. </p><p>Peter squeezed his arms around you and you melted into his touch. \u201cYa know, I really like that picture you took of me. You\u2019re so freakin talented.\u201d </p><p>You smiled against his neck. \u201cThanks, Pete. But it\u2019s just a hobby, nothing special.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrust me when I say, everything about you is special. And I hope I\u2019m allowed to show you every day just how special you are to me.\u201d He looked down at you, his chocolate brown were tinted with want. You could tell that he was nervous to be this open with someone. </p><p>You bent forward and kissed his lips sweetly. \u201cOnly if I get to do the same thing for you, Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>Peter embraced you tightly and lifted you off your feet and you could feel his face pressed into your hair. Your heart was soaring with excitement. The last thing you had expected from this weekend was catching the guy you\u2019d been pining after for so long. It was an amazing feeling. </p><p>Finally, Peter reluctantly put you down but held your hand up against his heart. \u201cI\u2019ll be your lockscreen for as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCOME ON, YOU LOVEBIRDS.\u201d You both burst out laughing as MJ screamed from the living room, snapping you out of your trance. You locked your hand with Peter and started gathering the sodas for your friends. </p><p>\u201cYou promised I could hold your hand if I got scared, right?\u201d You quipped and Peter\u2019s grin told you all you needed to know.</p>",

His lips felt calming and electric as they moved against yours. </p><p>Peter had turned and pinned you against the counter, deepening the kiss, and the thumping of his heart was echoing in your chest. His body was flush against yours and the heat was rushing to your head. The primal instinct within you was dying to keep going, unrelenting to let Peter out of your grasp. But the practical side of you was telling you that this was only your first kiss. The first of many, you hoped.</p><p>The need for air overtook the need for passion and you broke away. Peter was panting heavily, his breath washing over you. Without thinking, you stood on your tiptoes and pulled his lower lip in between your teeth and then let it snap back. Peter groaned and rested his forehead against yours. </p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful. God, I could kiss you all night.\u201d The words were husky with adoration. </p><p>You giggled like a schoolgirl and rubbed your nose against his. \u201cI think MJ and Ned might think something was up.\u201d </p><p>Peter\u2019s eyes flicked to the doorway and laughed an airy laugh. \u201cI think they may already know.\u201d </p><p>You turned your head quickly to see MJ and Ned standing in the doorway, knowing smirks on their face. A blush tipped your cheeks and you tucked in closer to Peter\u2019s body, your cheek placed against his neck. </p><p>\u201cYou owe me five bucks, Ned.\u201d MJ held her hand and Ned grumbled as he dug around in his pockets. </p><p>\u201cAh man, you two couldn\u2019t have waited two more weeks. I needed that.\u201d Ned hung his head and headed back into the living room. MJ shot you an annoyingly smug grin and disappeared to follow Ned. </p><p>Peter squeezed his arms around you and you melted into his touch. \u201cYa know, I really like that picture you took of me. You\u2019re so freakin talented.\u201d </p><p>You smiled against his neck. \u201cThanks, Pete. But it\u2019s just a hobby, nothing special.\u201d </p><p>\u201cTrust me when I say, everything about you is special. And I hope I\u2019m allowed to show you every day just how special you are to me.\u201d He looked down at you, his chocolate brown were tinted with want. You could tell that he was nervous to be this open with someone. </p><p>You bent forward and kissed his lips sweetly. \u201cOnly if I get to do the same thing for you, Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>Peter embraced you tightly and lifted you off your feet and you could feel his face pressed into your hair. Your heart was soaring with excitement. The last thing you had expected from this weekend was catching the guy you\u2019d been pining after for so long. It was an amazing feeling. </p><p>Finally, Peter reluctantly put you down but held your hand up against his heart. \u201cI\u2019ll be your lockscreen for as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d </p><p>\u201cCOME ON, YOU LOVEBIRDS.\u201d You both burst out laughing as MJ screamed from the living room, snapping you out of your trance. You locked your hand with Peter and started gathering the sodas for your friends. </p><p>\u201cYou promised I could hold your hand if I got scared, right?\u201d You quipped and Peter\u2019s grin told you all you needed to know.</p></p>",

Patiently, you and your best friend MJ waited for the rest of your classmates to leave before gathering your belongings.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you still cool with sleeping over this weekend, Y/N?\u201d MJ asked as you two walked up to your side-by-side lockers.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! I\u2019ve been so busy lately. It\u2019s like all of the school events happen in the last month of school. Principal Morita has had me booked solid taking pictures.\u201d You were shoving books in your locker aimlessly as tiredness was settling in your bones. </p>[[MORE]]<p>MJ slammed her locker and looked at you with excitement. \u201cWell we\u2019re not going to worry about that this weekend. We\u2019re going to stock up on junk food, the guys are going to come over, and forget all about anything school related!\u201d </p><p>Your heart picked up slightly at the thought of seeing Peter tonight. You hadn\u2019t seen him all day so it made you even more excited. But you kept your face devoid of emotion in order to keep your crush on Peter Parker to yourself. You hadn\u2019t told MJ and you weren\u2019t planning on letting it slip in the school hallway. </p><p>MJ didn\u2019t seem to notice your change in demeanor, instead she snatched your hand and shook it, squealing with you for a minute. Then she stopped and looked around, making sure no one had seen her. You giggled energetically and tangled your arm with hers. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, you dork!\u201d </p><p>~~~ </p><p>The windows were wide open to let the breeze flow through the room and MJ had the music cranked to an ungodly level. The two of you had changed into your pajamas and were dancing around the room, a thin layer of sweat on your skin. </p><p>It felt amazing to escape the strain of your current lifestyle even for just a few hours. MJ had forced you to promise that you wouldn\u2019t use your camera for anything professional for the whole weekend and it hadn\u2019t taken much to accept that stipulation. </p><p><i>Knock knock</i>. MJ was lost in the music so you swayed your way to the front door, half expecting the pizza delivery boy. You swung the door open and froze in your spot as you came face to face with chocolate brown eyes, messy curls, and perfectly pouty lips. He looked adorable in a Stark Industries t-shirt that fit him wonderfully. </p><p>Instinctively, you reached up to tame your hair that had tangled into a hornets nest during your dance session. It was evident that it was a lost cause so you diverted to straightening your tank top and shorts instead. </p><p>Peter watched you with fascination and your stomach was erupting with butterflies as his gaze traveled along your face. Ned kept looking back and forth between the two of you, unaware of what was going on.</p><p>\u201cHi, Y/N. What have you and MJ been up too?\u201d Ned broke in at last. </p><p>You turned your focus to Ned, remembering that he was here too. \u201cHey, Ned. Um, just been listening to some music while we waited for the pizza.\u201d You gave Peter a small smile. \u201cI got extra pepperoni for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAh, awesome! Thanks, Y/N/N, you\u2019re the best.\u201d Peter exclaimed and you beamed from being praised.<br></p><p>The boys crowded their way into the living room and plopped down onto the couch in their usual places. Trying to act as casual as possible, you sank into the place right next to Peter and tucked your feet under you. It was impossible to ignore that his hand was just inches from your knee. One little bump and his long fingers could be on your skin. </p><p>\u201cWhat movie do you guys want to start with?\u201d MJ asked from the floor, her body turned just enough to acknowledge the group. </p><p>Ned bounced slightly, \u201cLet\u2019s watch a scary movie!\u201d </p><p>The rest of the group agreed easily but you groaned loudly. \u201cNot another scary movie, you guys. I\u2019ll be up all night.\u201d </p><p>Peter leaned over, his shoulder bumping into yours. You were hyper-sensitive to the feeling of his shoulder against yours. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything get you. You can hold my hand if you get scared.\u201d </p><p>Goosebumps speckled your skin in an instant. He was watching you with that comforting gaze that always made you feel protected. You slowly nodded and his eyes glistened with delight. You bit your lip nervously, dying to press your mouth to his, instead you fell backwards against the fluffy pillow beside you. </p><p>Another knock at the door interrupted the chatter and MJ jumped up to answer it. </p><p>\u201cSomeone get the drinks, I\u2019ll get the pizza.\u201d She called as she ran out of the room. You moved to get up at the same time as Peter. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you get everything.\u201d He offered when you gave him a weird look. A small flutter went through your body as he motioned for you to lead the way. </p><p>Your head was buried in the fridge when you recognized the faint tune of your cell alarm. You glanced around to see it lying on the kitchen counter. </p><p>\u201cCan you get that, Pete? It\u2019s probably just my alarm.\u201d And you returned to pulling out different sodas from the rack. </p><p>\u201cSure, no problem\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off. </p><p>Silence hung over the room like a blanket and you looked up to find him staring at your phone screen. \u201cUm, are you okay? Pete?\u201d </p><p><b>\u201cAm I your lockscreen?\u201d </b></p><p>You swallowed thickly. It had completely slipped your mind that you had made him your lock screen a few weeks ago. You had been on your way to take pictures for the Robotics Competition when you had seen him in the hallway talking to a classmate. He just looked so happy and free that you couldn\u2019t stop yourself from capturing the moment. </p><p>Now, he was standing in front of you, barely more than a step away, waiting for an answer. You wondered if he could hear the blood rushing in your ears or the thudding of your heart inside your chest. </p><p>\u201cUm. Well, yes. I just love the picture and I like to have things I like for my wallpaper\u2026\u201d Your feet had suddenly become more interesting to you in the last 15 seconds. </p><p>\u201cAnd you like me?\u201d His voice was soft. </p><p>All you could do was nod like a child who was scared to be scolded. </p><p>You were surprised by a hand tilting your chin up, and you lifted your eyes to meet his. Shivers were running down your spine as Peter smiled sweetly down at you. He leaned forward, his nose brushing against yours, and your breath was caught in your throat. Was this really happening? </p><p>He hesitated in that spot, \u201cI like you too.\u201d Lips rubbing against each other as he said the words. </p><p>You lost all sensibility in that moment. You wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled him the rest of the way. He made a little <i>oof</i> of surprise and placed his hands on your waist instantaneously. </p><p>You and Peter were pushing and pulling against each other like fuel to a fire.

You could tell that he was nervous to be this open with someone. </p><p>You bent forward and kissed his lips sweetly. &ldquo;Only if I get to do the same thing for you, Peter Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>Peter embraced you tightly and lifted you off your feet and you could feel his face pressed into your hair. Your heart was soaring with excitement. The last thing you had expected from this weekend was catching the guy you&rsquo;d been pining after for so long. It was an amazing feeling. </p><p>Finally, Peter reluctantly put you down but held your hand up against his heart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your lockscreen for as long as you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;COME ON, YOU LOVEBIRDS.&rdquo; You both burst out laughing as MJ screamed from the living room, snapping you out of your trance. You locked your hand with Peter and started gathering the sodas for your friends. </p><p>&ldquo;You promised I could hold your hand if I got scared, right?&rdquo; You quipped and Peter&rsquo;s grin told you all you needed to know.</p></p>",

The hooligans sat in the back and seemed to be putting on a circus. Meanwhile, the ~quirky~ crowd sat up front. Everyone knows the ones I\u2019m talking about, every school has them. The sweet spot, you discovered, was somewhere in the middle but close enough to the front to avoid mysterious projectiles from the back. That\u2019s where you and your friends sat. </p><p>You had met Peter in freshman year, when you two were assigned as lab partners. You just couldn\u2019t help not being friends with him. It didn\u2019t take long for feelings to evolve. True, he was good looking. You would be one of the first to admit that. But it was his personality that really did you in.

You gave him a sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cSorry, zoned out again. What were you saying?\u201d Peter raised a brow at you. </p><p>\u201cNed was trying to bribe me into eating a bug when we get there. You\u2019ve been zoning out a lot lately.\u201d Ned leaned over, a shit-eating grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wonder why.\u201d Your face reddened. Ned found out about your not-so-little crush last summer. It\u2019s no surprise, considering you weren\u2019t exactly subtle about it. It\u2019s a wonder that Peter hadn\u2019t caught on. </p><p>\u201cJust tired, I guess. Didn\u2019t drink any coffee this morning,\u201d you quickly explained. Peter nodded and went back to talking about how he was not going to be eating bugs. You glared at Ned, who just laughed at you. </p><p>You were beyond ecstatic when the bus stopped. As you grabbed your bag and followed the conga-line out, you complained that your legs felt like jello from sitting so long. The teachers herded everyone onto the camping grounds and handed out the tents. For a school full of geniuses, you\u2019d think setting up a tent would be fairly simple. </p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>It was nearly dark by the time everyone was finished, so, instead of going on the hike the original itinerary included, everyone settled on having a bonfire and roasting marshmallows. </p><p>As it turns out, Peter is absolutely useless when it comes to roasting a marshmallow. He either turns it into a fireball or drops it in the dirt on accident. Being the wilderness extraordinaire that you are, you offered to make a couple of s\u2019mores for him. You went to hand him the chocolatey-gooey-goodness, but he just stared at you with wide eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/N, don\u2019t freak out. There\u2019s a giant spider on your shoulder.\u201d You froze, slowly looking towards your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cOh my god. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just ran down your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw! Get it off!\u201d you screeched, swatting at your back. \u201cPeter, is it gone?\u201d He just continued to stare at you. \u201cPeter, help me get it off!\u201d His facade cracked, and Peter dissolved into a fit of giggles. You narrowed your eyes at him and scoffed. \u201cThere\u2019s no spider, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I just had to get you.\u201d He held out a hand, expecting you to hand over the s\u2019more. You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, no, no, no. After that? Nope, no treat for you.\u201d Much to Peter\u2019s horror, you tossed the s\u2019more into the fire. </p><p>\u201cWhat did it do to you? It was too young to die!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee what happens? You\u2019ve made me waste a perfectly good s\u2019more,\u201d you teased, placing your hands on your hips. Ned rolled his eyes at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys fight like an old couple.\u201d Your face went red again, and you avoided Peter\u2019s gaze, taking a seat in the grass. Too bad you missed that Peter was blushing too. </p><p>He sat down next to you, and neither of you spoke for several minutes. You just watched the fire slowly die down. Your classmates were trickling back to their tents, leaving just a handful by the fire. Most of them were engrossed in their own conversations. You glanced over at Peter. He was looking up at the sky, deep in thought. As you started to turn back to the fire, you noticed a small creature inching its way up his pant leg. \u201cPeter,\u201d you hissed. He hummed and tilted his head to the side, giving you a lopsided grin. \u201cThere\u2019s a big ass centipede on your leg.\u201d He snorted.</p><p>\u201cUsing my trick against me? You\u2019ll have to try harder than that, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching it!\u201d Peter eyed you carefully. You seemed both horrified and concerned. He decided to play into your little game, looking down at his leg. His jaw dropped when he saw that you weren\u2019t trying to trick him and that there was actually a massive centipede crawling towards his stomach. </p><p>The boy screamed and leapt to his feet. He swatted at the tiny beast while jumping up and down. Everyone\u2019s attention turned to him. Some tried to conceal their laughter, while others blatantly laughed at him. Peter spun around, looking everywhere to make sure there weren\u2019t any more bugs on himself. \u201cIs there a little girl lost somewhere, or was that just Parker screaming?\u201d Flash sniggered. Peter froze, realizing that everyone was staring at him. His face turned as red as a tomato, and he tried to hide behind his hands. You stood up, staring down Flash. </p><p>\u201cShut up! You\u2019d react the same way.\u201d Flash scoffed and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh. I\u2019m a man. I\u2019m not scared of a little bug.\u201d You quickly scanned the ground before finding your target. You grimaced, but it was the only way to avenge Peter\u2019s honor. Picking up the centipede, you flung it at Flash. He screamed just as loud as Peter. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d he screeched before retreating to his tent. You heard Peter laugh and smiled. He looked slightly less embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Y/N. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Pete. But I was a little disappointed that Flash didn\u2019t piss his pants like I was expecting him to.\u201d Peter snorted, shaking his head. He opened his mouth then closed it. You watched him expectantly. After a few moments, he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was wondering\u2014 uh\u2014 when we get back to the city, do you wanna hang out sometime? Like, just us?\u201d he squeaked. Your smile widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Peter\u2019s face lit up, almost as if he didn\u2019t believe you would agree. Then, there was a voice in the distance. Not just any voice, it was Ned\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time! MJ, told you he would ask them out before the end of the trip. You owe me five bucks!\u201d</p>",

It didn\u2019t take long for feelings to evolve. True, he was good looking. You would be one of the first to admit that. But it was his personality that really did you in. He was too bubbly and kindhearted to avoid.

You know why you like him.</p><p>Anyways, back to the story.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cHello? Earth to Y/N?\u201d You blinked, realizing that Peter was waving a hand in front of your face. You gave him a sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cSorry, zoned out again. What were you saying?\u201d Peter raised a brow at you. </p><p>\u201cNed was trying to bribe me into eating a bug when we get there. You\u2019ve been zoning out a lot lately.\u201d Ned leaned over, a shit-eating grin plastered across his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wonder why.\u201d Your face reddened. Ned found out about your not-so-little crush last summer. It\u2019s no surprise, considering you weren\u2019t exactly subtle about it. It\u2019s a wonder that Peter hadn\u2019t caught on. </p><p>\u201cJust tired, I guess. Didn\u2019t drink any coffee this morning,\u201d you quickly explained. Peter nodded and went back to talking about how he was not going to be eating bugs. You glared at Ned, who just laughed at you. </p><p>You were beyond ecstatic when the bus stopped. As you grabbed your bag and followed the conga-line out, you complained that your legs felt like jello from sitting so long. The teachers herded everyone onto the camping grounds and handed out the tents. For a school full of geniuses, you\u2019d think setting up a tent would be fairly simple. </p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>It was nearly dark by the time everyone was finished, so, instead of going on the hike the original itinerary included, everyone settled on having a bonfire and roasting marshmallows. </p><p>As it turns out, Peter is absolutely useless when it comes to roasting a marshmallow. He either turns it into a fireball or drops it in the dirt on accident. Being the wilderness extraordinaire that you are, you offered to make a couple of s\u2019mores for him. You went to hand him the chocolatey-gooey-goodness, but he just stared at you with wide eyes. </p><p>\u201cY/N, don\u2019t freak out. There\u2019s a giant spider on your shoulder.\u201d You froze, slowly looking towards your shoulder. </p><p>\u201cOh my god. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just ran down your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw! Get it off!\u201d you screeched, swatting at your back. \u201cPeter, is it gone?\u201d He just continued to stare at you. \u201cPeter, help me get it off!\u201d His facade cracked, and Peter dissolved into a fit of giggles. You narrowed your eyes at him and scoffed. \u201cThere\u2019s no spider, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I just had to get you.\u201d He held out a hand, expecting you to hand over the s\u2019more. You shook your head.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, no, no, no. After that? Nope, no treat for you.\u201d Much to Peter\u2019s horror, you tossed the s\u2019more into the fire. </p><p>\u201cWhat did it do to you? It was too young to die!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee what happens? You\u2019ve made me waste a perfectly good s\u2019more,\u201d you teased, placing your hands on your hips. Ned rolled his eyes at the two of you.</p><p>\u201cYou guys fight like an old couple.\u201d Your face went red again, and you avoided Peter\u2019s gaze, taking a seat in the grass. Too bad you missed that Peter was blushing too. </p><p>He sat down next to you, and neither of you spoke for several minutes. You just watched the fire slowly die down. Your classmates were trickling back to their tents, leaving just a handful by the fire. Most of them were engrossed in their own conversations. You glanced over at Peter. He was looking up at the sky, deep in thought. As you started to turn back to the fire, you noticed a small creature inching its way up his pant leg. \u201cPeter,\u201d you hissed. He hummed and tilted his head to the side, giving you a lopsided grin. \u201cThere\u2019s a big ass centipede on your leg.\u201d He snorted.</p><p>\u201cUsing my trick against me? You\u2019ll have to try harder than that, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching it!\u201d Peter eyed you carefully. You seemed both horrified and concerned. He decided to play into your little game, looking down at his leg. His jaw dropped when he saw that you weren\u2019t trying to trick him and that there was actually a massive centipede crawling towards his stomach. </p><p>The boy screamed and leapt to his feet. He swatted at the tiny beast while jumping up and down. Everyone\u2019s attention turned to him. Some tried to conceal their laughter, while others blatantly laughed at him. Peter spun around, looking everywhere to make sure there weren\u2019t any more bugs on himself. \u201cIs there a little girl lost somewhere, or was that just Parker screaming?\u201d Flash sniggered. Peter froze, realizing that everyone was staring at him. His face turned as red as a tomato, and he tried to hide behind his hands. You stood up, staring down Flash. </p><p>\u201cShut up! You\u2019d react the same way.\u201d Flash scoffed and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh. I\u2019m a man. I\u2019m not scared of a little bug.\u201d You quickly scanned the ground before finding your target. You grimaced, but it was the only way to avenge Peter\u2019s honor. Picking up the centipede, you flung it at Flash. He screamed just as loud as Peter. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d he screeched before retreating to his tent. You heard Peter laugh and smiled. He looked slightly less embarrassed. </p><p>\u201cThanks, Y/N. I owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Pete. But I was a little disappointed that Flash didn\u2019t piss his pants like I was expecting him to.\u201d Peter snorted, shaking his head. He opened his mouth then closed it. You watched him expectantly. After a few moments, he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was wondering\u2014 uh\u2014 when we get back to the city, do you wanna hang out sometime? Like, just us?\u201d he squeaked. Your smile widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d Peter\u2019s face lit up, almost as if he didn\u2019t believe you would agree. Then, there was a voice in the distance. Not just any voice, it was Ned\u2019s. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time! MJ, told you he would ask them out before the end of the trip. You owe me five bucks!\u201d</p>",
