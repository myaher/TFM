From Sansa and Arya we also learn that it keeps falling lightly even when they\u2019re about to leave, so much so that Arya can\u2019t make snowballs because the snow is too fresh still. It means that not many time elapsed from Jon\u2019s goodbye to Bran till their parting from Winterfell, actually, I think it\u2019s all very quick: Jon repeats three times that <i><b>everything is noise and confusion</b>,</i> snow is falling and everyone is<b> <i>in an uproar to be off</i></b>, so probably Arya, with new vigor now that she got Needle, is done packing a short time after he left and then they all leave hurriedly.<br></p><p>But who is in the yard? If the space of time between Robb\u2019s farewell and the departure is short, we can assume that when Jon is with Robb, Sansa is there too, all excited for her new life in the South.\u00a0Contrary to Arya in fact, probably Sansa had accurately packed and was ready when Jon was supposed to leave, according to the information from Arya (<b><i>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me out to say good-bye.\u201d )</i></b>, which was circa an hour prior<b><i>.</i></b> Has she been there all the time?\u00a0</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6053e2d87c5f4869431bca85a814f0d3/tumblr_inline_pkocso3wSr1vseiju_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>She has to be there now, and for sure with Lady, because Jon tells us that the <b>WOLVES</b> are in the yard, and since they\u2019re puppies, it\u2019s logical that they\u2019re not alone. Take also into account that there\u2019s a high chance that the WOLVES are not just the DIREWOLVES, but the STARKS too, specifically, in this case, Sansa and Rickon. This could explain, at least in part, why Jon doesn\u2019t mention them in his memory of the day he left: they are concealed under the falling snow, in the chaos with Robb and the <b>AUBURN HAIR </b>he shares with them.<br></p><p><b><i>He looked around at all the noise and confusion. \u201cLeaving is harder than I thought.\u201d\u00a0</i></b><br></p><p>In all that <b>NOISE AND CONFUSION</b> that Jon insists on reminding us, there is Sansa. It is here that Jon has the last glimpse of her and he\u2019s probably looking at her too when he says that leaving is hard, because Jon tells us that the wolves, whether direwolves and/or Starks, are <b>SURROUNDING</b> Robb and so she is NECESSARILY close by, and he NECESSARILY sees her.\u00a0</p><p><b>\u201cLEAVING IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT\u2026\u201d</b><br></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95ca64a3b3d6d2a2772ee8e6c63bf5a4/tumblr_inline_pkgq5zZymH1vseiju_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"></figure><p>And where was Jon while uncle Benjen looked for him?

From Sansa and Arya we also learn that it keeps falling lightly even when they&rsquo;re about to leave, so much so that Arya can&rsquo;t make snowballs because the snow is too fresh still. It means that not many time elapsed from Jon&rsquo;s goodbye to Bran till their parting from Winterfell, actually, I think it&rsquo;s all very quick: Jon repeats three times that <i><b>everything is noise and confusion</b>,</i> snow is falling and everyone is<b> <i>in an uproar to be off</i></b>, so probably Arya, with new vigor now that she got Needle, is done packing a short time after he left and then they all leave hurriedly.<br /></p><p>But who is in the yard? If the space of time between Robb&rsquo;s farewell and the departure is short, we can assume that when Jon is with Robb, Sansa is there too, all excited for her new life in the South.&nbsp;Contrary to Arya in fact, probably Sansa had accurately packed and was ready when Jon was supposed to leave, according to the information from Arya (<b><i>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me out to say good-bye.&rdquo; )</i></b>, which was circa an hour prior<b><i>.</i></b> Has she been there all the time?&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6053e2d87c5f4869431bca85a814f0d3/tumblr_inline_pkocso3wSr1vseiju_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>She has to be there now, and for sure with Lady, because Jon tells us that the <b>WOLVES</b> are in the yard, and since they&rsquo;re puppies, it&rsquo;s logical that they&rsquo;re not alone. Take also into account that there&rsquo;s a high chance that the WOLVES are not just the DIREWOLVES, but the STARKS too, specifically, in this case, Sansa and Rickon. This could explain, at least in part, why Jon doesn&rsquo;t mention them in his memory of the day he left: they are concealed under the falling snow, in the chaos with Robb and the <b>AUBURN HAIR </b>he shares with them.<br /></p><p><b><i>He looked around at all the noise and confusion. &ldquo;Leaving is harder than I thought.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></b><br /></p><p>In all that <b>NOISE AND CONFUSION</b> that Jon insists on reminding us, there is Sansa. It is here that Jon has the last glimpse of her and he&rsquo;s probably looking at her too when he says that leaving is hard, because Jon tells us that the wolves, whether direwolves and/or Starks, are <b>SURROUNDING</b> Robb and so she is NECESSARILY close by, and he NECESSARILY sees her.&nbsp;</p><p><b>&ldquo;LEAVING IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT&hellip;&rdquo;</b><br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95ca64a3b3d6d2a2772ee8e6c63bf5a4/tumblr_inline_pkgq5zZymH1vseiju_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And where was Jon while uncle Benjen looked for him? He could not be found, hence he wasn&rsquo;t where he was supposed to be or where it might have been guessed that he was. He was not with Robb or Bran or Arya, obviously not with Catelyn, and I guess not with Ned because he was probably busy at that point. Did he go to say goodbye to Rickon maybe? Jon says that he has only one last farewell to make, which is to Arya, so he might have gone to him sometime before going to Robb. But <i><b>THE WOLVES ARE IN THE YARD</b></i>: was Sansa keeping an eye on him, maybe while <i><b>brushing out Lady&rsquo;s coat and singing to herself&hellip;?</b></i> Was Jon with them?</p><p>Or was he simply taking some time because <i><b>LEAVING WAS HARDER THAN HE THOUGHT</b></i>? Did he maybe, <i><b>FROM A CORNER, </b></i>saw Benjen asking for him (and that&rsquo;d be why he knew it)? It&rsquo;s interesting, in this regard, that D&amp;D made sure that we, and Sansa, did remember what Jon&rsquo;s favourite hobby was at the time&hellip;<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a603067e76a4dede072a5c9ca04ec17/tumblr_inline_pkgz84gEeQ1vseiju_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&ldquo;<i><b>I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t have been great fun.

Was she <i>brushing out Lady&rsquo;s coat and singing to herself</i>? Consider that if Sansa was <b>SINGING TO HERSELF</b>, it clearly means that she wasn&rsquo;t singing for someone else, which implies that, at any moment that happened, every time that might have happened, Jon had to be staring at her FROM A DISTANCE, and you don&rsquo;t usually stare at someone by chance, as D&amp;D showed us right after their reunion.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/68220a04565d1ce98052c1ac32e3b9d1/tumblr_inline_pkp97xTifI1vseiju_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>And what a lovely sight it must have been&hellip; which brings me straight to <b><i><a href=\"https://jonlovessansa.tumblr.com/post/182633116797/of-sansa-brushing-out-ladys-coat-part-2\">part 2</a></i>.</b><br /></p><p>Thanks for listening!<br /></p>",
