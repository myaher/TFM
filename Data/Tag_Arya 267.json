Her chest constricted at the memory of Jon&rsquo;s content with what little he\u2019d been given- believing he was even luckier than most- due to the circumstances of his birth.</p><p>\u201cI believe none of us did,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A moment passed between them and Arya slightly deflated, prompting Daenerys to once more ask her, \u201cWhat say you of the things you\u2019ve observed between Jon and I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see how much he\u2026\u201d trailing off, Arya looked away before fixing her gaze to the woman who\u2019s stolen her brother\u2019s heart once more. \u201cI see a look I\u2019ve never seen him give anyone in the past. I want it to stay. If it is no trouble to you.\u201d</p><p>It never could be, Daenerys wanted to say. Briefly she pondered telling Arya she was not the first woman her brother had loved, but it was not her story to share, so she instead nodded at the youngest she-wolf of Winterfell. \u201cI do endeavour to make him as happy as he makes me,\u201d she acknowledged, smiling almost sheepishly at Jon\u2019s overprotective youngest sister.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"267\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"captainamericas:qAJVzMpBBf8pfRQhKxEKyQ:Z-yQ2y2ZGBEC7\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f085fd577a547a5eef620e1d6280ec77/tumblr_paylyu30am1qeam0qo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-orig-height=\"267\"/></figure><p>\u201cYou love him.\u201d It was a statement. Again, a firm nod was all Arya received but this time a brighter twinkle in the queen\u2019s eyes confirmed what she already knew- that love had found her as it has her brother, bringing the dragon and the white wolf together.</p><p>They maintained their gaze for what seemed like an eternity before Arya finally nodded in return, accepting what has come to pass.</p><p>\u201cIf you betray him, the north will remember. I will remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt we will hurt one another once in a while,\u201d Daenerys smiled sadly, knowing the dark times ahead and the decisions she and Jon will have to make and undoubtedly argue about. \u201cBut betrayal has always been something I have been on the receiving end of, so you need not worry in that regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Feeling lighter from their conversation and at seemingly receiving the closest thing to a blessing from this young Stark, Daenerys stood and smiled slyly at Arya whose eyebrow rose in curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lady Stark,\u201d Daenerys started teasingly, knowing it riled her up.</p><p>If possible, the raised brow rose higher, making Daenerys\u2019 smile widen as she invited, \u201cWould you like to meet my sons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sons?\u201d Confusion laced the last word, doubt and suspicion clouding the young wolf\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the queen said proudly, walking ahead towards the door.</p><p>Hand pulling it open, she looked back at Arya with a playful smile on her lips and a mischievous glint in her eyes and clarified, \u201cMy dragons.\u201d</p>",
