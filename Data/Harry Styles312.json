Not that she cared that much about\nbeing linked to him, but she understood why he wanted to keep it quiet for now.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t live our\nlives under a rock, sooner or later,they\u2019re going to find out.\u201d The park\nappeared in their view and Harry picked up Anna\u2019s bag before she had the chance\nto fight him on it, \u201cand I want to take you to Central Park, so I guess it will\nbe sooner\u201d he placed a kiss on her forehead and paid the taxi driver using his\ncard.</p><!-- more --><p>They stepped out of\nthe cab and Anna felt her stomach drop as she realised how many young girls\nwere hanging around the area. It didn\u2019t seem to phase Harry though, he simply\nheld onto Anna\u2019s hand, without a care who saw it. They walked along in silence\nfor a while, until they got to the spot where they were meant to meet Mitch and\nSarah and much to Anna\u2019s surprise, not one person stopped them, she did catch a\nfew people doing the same double take that the taxi driver had when they got\ninto the car, but no one seemed to care that he was with her. </p><p>\u201cThis seems like a\nnice spot,\u201d Harry said, sitting himself down on an open patch of grass, basking\nin the sunlight.</p><p>Anna joined him,\nsitting cross legged by his side. \u201cHow late are we thinking Mitch and Sarah\nwill be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf Mitch has any say\nin it, they\u2019ll be on time, but I don\u2019t think Mitch gets a say\u201d Harry laughed </p><p>Anna nodded \u201cI think\nyou might be wrong there\u201d, she pointed towards the two figures walking towards\nthem. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mitch I\nsaid that!\u201d he whispered into her ear as he stood up to greet them. Anna was\nnervous not only about getting spotted and ambushed by Harry\u2019s fans, but also\nabout spending this much time with Sarah. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like her,\nit was quite the opposite actually, she really wanted to be friends with her,\nbut she found her intimidating and even more so when Mitch was around. In the\nthree weeks that Anna had spent on tour with Harry so far, she had gotten close\nwith Clare and even Helene, but she hadn\u2019t been able to talk to Sarah. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an amazing\nhotdog stand not far from here\u201d Mitch said as Anna tuned back into the\nconversation.\u201cThey even have vegan options,\u201d he looked at Sarah knowing there\nwas no way she\u2019d be eating a hot dog, or letting him for that matter. </p><p>\u201cWell I did promise\nAnna the full New York experience\u201d Harry said looking at Anna </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that\nhungry,\u201d she admitted \u201cI\u2019ll just have some of yours\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at her,\na little concerned by the lack of food she\u2019d eaten over the last few days. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she smiled\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just can\u2019t eat a hot dog that big\u201d </p><p>A smile stretched\nacross Mitch&rsquo;s face \u201cYou sure about that Anna?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s cheeks flushed\nred and she rolled her eyes at him as Harry cackled at the joke. </p><p>\u201cShould we go then?\u201d\nSarah interrupted looking at Anna with a smile. The boys nodded and Harry\ngrabbed Anna\u2019s hand once again. Jokes like that didn\u2019t usually bother Anna, but\nher and Harry were yet to sleep together, in fact, it had been almost a year\nsince Anna had slept with anyone, and the last thing she wanted was for it to\nbe awkward when it finally happened with Harry. </p><p>The hotdog stand sat\nnear a bridge and more open grass, but there were a lot more people around and\none of them, just happened to recognise Harry. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d the girl\nsaid as she got closer to them. </p><p>He held onto Anna\u2019s\nhand a little tighter, which is the last thing she expected him to do, she\nfigured if any fan even looked at them then he would drop her hand.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said softly,\nnot wanting to be rude, but suddenly very aware that this was the first time\nhe\u2019d ever been out in public with Anna. </p><p>\u201cOh my god it is you,\nI wasn\u2019t sure if it was, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be in Central Park\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen in town..\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cWhat\u2019s your name love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d she said,\ntears forming in her eyes \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan since the beginning, shit I never\nthought I\u2019d get to meet \u00a0you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nsmiled and dropped Anna\u2019s hand, opening his arms to hug the girl \u201cbring it in\u201d\nhe said and she did, she hugged him as the tears spilled out of her eyes and he\nwouldn\u2019t let go until she did. </p><p>\u201cCan I get a photo?\u201d\nshe asked as she pulled away, carelessly shoving her phone into Anna\u2019s hand.\nShe was a little taken aback by the gesture, but she took the shots anyway, as\nboth Harry and the girl smiled for the camera. Sarah and Mitch had ducked away\nto avoid taking photos too and were already busy getting their food, so Anna\nstood awkwardly as Harry said goodbye. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he said once\nshe was out of earshot \u201cShe didn\u2019t even notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople are going to\ncare eventually Harry\u201d Anna took his hand again </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me\u201d\nhe leant down and kissed her cheek \u201cnow are you sure you don\u2019t want anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get\nhot dogs, we can get something else if you\u2019d prefer?\u201d He knew she hadn\u2019t eaten\nmuch breakfast this morning and he was starting to get worried about her. </p><p>\u201cHot dogs are fine\nHaz, I\u2019ll have a bite of yours but I\u2019m really not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat\nbreakfast\u201d he said looking concerned </p><p>\u201cI had a banana\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t count, what\u2019s\ngoing on love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently I don\u2019t\ndeal well with jetlag\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cWe can go\nhome and nap if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet your food first\u201d\nshe smiled. </p><p>If she was honest,\nshe was over the jetlag, it had been three weeks, but the constant travel was\ngetting to her and now that her and Harry were sharing a room, she was having\ntrouble sleeping, she wasn\u2019t used to having someone sleeping next to her and\nHarry snored louder than she thought humanly possible. She wasn\u2019t hungry\nbecause she was tired and she was tired because she needed her space, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to be away from Harry. </p><p>Mitch and Sarah had\nalready sat down in a shady spot under a tree and were quite content with each\nother. Harry looked at Anna and then at his two bandmates and back to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy over\nthere, let\u2019s go home and we\u2019ll order something in\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Anna had woken up\nfeeling wonderful this morning, but by the time 6pm rolled around she was\nfeeling ill again and she had no idea why. She slept like a baby last night and\nshe\u2019d even eaten breakfast, which isn\u2019t something she did when she was home,\nshe usually skipped straight to lunch but this morning Harry had insisted on\ncooking her breakfast and she had to admit he was a pretty good cook. \u00a0</p><p>But it was 6:30 pm\nnow and she was sitting backstage at Madison Square Garden, her laptop open to\na blank document, sipping on a green tea, hoping that it would make her feel\nbetter, or at least inspire her to write something. Since being on tour with\nHarry her blog had taken a backseat, she had a lot to write about and things\nshe\u2019d love to share with her followers, but she couldn\u2019t because no one knew\nthere was anything going on with her and Harry. Of course there were the few\nfans that had their suspicions, but no one believed that they were actually\ndating, as far as his fandom was concerned, he was still with Camille and Anna\nwas happy to leave it at that for a little while longer but that did make it\nhard for her to write blog posts about her travels. She didn\u2019t doubt that those\nwith suspicions would compare her itinerary to Harry\u2019s and realise that it was\nexactly the same. </p><p>\u201cClarrrre\u201d Anna\nmoaned as Clare sat down next to her </p><p>\u201cAnnnnna\u201d she\nmimicked Anna\u2019s tone and rested her head on the table. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have\nanything to write about!\u201d </p><p>Clare sat up and\nlooked around the room \u201cPing Pong,\u201d she laughed and \u00a0pointed at the rather\nintense ping pong competition that Harry had organised. </p><p>Anna thought for a\nminute, \u201cI think too many Harry fans know about the ping pong thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Clare said.\n\u201cThey also think he was dating Camille\u201d </p><p>\u201cI like that it\u2019s our\nsecret for now,\u201d she admitted. </p><p>\u201cHe really likes you\nAnna\u201d Clare said, lowering her voice so that no one could hear them \u201cI\u2019ve only\nknown him for two years, but I\u2019ve never seen him act the way he does around\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it\nstrange that he had Camille on the first half of the tour and now I\u2019m here?\u201d\nThis was something that Anna hadn\u2019t really been able to let go of, as much as\nshe liked Harry, she couldn\u2019t help but see Ronnie\u2019s point, she was just a tour\nbuddy, once it all ends and he can go back to his normal life Anna would be\nforgotten about. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much\nabout what happened between them\u201d Clare admitted \u201cbut I know that for most of\nthe European leg, he did whatever he could to avoid being alone with her and\nafter that she disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe told me it was\nall sex\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re here now An, I think he likes you enough to try\nand make it work, but he had the next few months of his life already set out\nfor him and the only way he could make it work with you is to have you here\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou might be right\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be\ninvasive or anything, but have you two had sex yet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna blushed\n\u201cthere\u2019s been a few times when it could have happened but we both made excuses\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d Clare\nnodded \u201cmeans there\u2019s more to the relationship, but don\u2019t let it go to long\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly my\nfault, I keep chickening out\u201d as close as she\u2019d gotten to Clare over the last\nfew weeks, this was the first time they\u2019d spoken about anything like this and\nshe felt a little weird about it considering Harry was technically Clare\u2019s\nboss. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she didn\u2019t\nseem phased by the conversation. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a\nyear\u201d Anna hid her face in her hands \u201cwhat if they\u2019ve changed it?\u201d</p><p>Clare giggled and put\nher hand on Anna\u2019s back, \u201cI assure you, it hasn\u2019t changed\u201d </p><p>\u201cOi Elliot\u201d, Harry\ncalled across the room bringing their conversation to an end as Anna turned\naround to face him. </p><p>\u201cOi Styles\u201d Anna\ncalled back, a grin on her face </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up love,\u201d he\ntwisted the ping pong bat in his hand and picked up the other one,holding it\nout to her</p><p>She shut her laptop\nand stood up, making her way towards him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve\nplayed ping pong since I was about 10,\u201d she said taking the bat off him </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d he\nwinked at her and Clare started giggling from the sidelines \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into\nher?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cOh, we were just\nhaving a chat\u201d, Anna smiled \u201cNow it\u2019s game on Styles.\u201d </p><p>Harry had his game\nface on, and so did Anna, even though she\u2019s avoided ping pong at all costs\nsince the beginning of the tour. Sports had never been her thing and she didn\u2019t\nwant to embarrass herself in front of him but today was different. She knew how\nnervous he was about this show and she thought that maybe this would keep him\ndistracted before he had to go on stage. </p><p>\u201cYou call that a\ntrick shot Styles?\u201d Anna said as she hit the ball back to him </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, he smirked \u201cI\u2019m\nbeing gentle\u201d and with that he used all the power in his right hand to hit the\nball back to Anna. She hadn\u2019t been expecting it to be going so fast so when she\nswung her arm, she missed, the little orange ball sped right past her and Harry\nburst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened to\nbeing gentle?\u201d she pouted as she turned around to fetch the ball. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not going\nto just let you win love\u201d he shrugged \u201cso are we going to play properly? Or are\nyou forfeiting now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give up that\neasily\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he\nlaughed \u201cI seem to remember you giving up on uni pretty easily\u201d </p><p>Anna gritted her\nteeth through a giggle \u201cOh it\u2019s on Styles\u201d </p><p>She threw the ball up\nto serve but missed on the swing. Harry raised his eyebrows and held back a\nlaugh but he didn\u2019t say anything, he simply put his bat down and walked around\nthe table so that he was standing behind Anna. </p><p>\u201cLet me show you\u201d he\nwrapped his arms around her and adjusted her hands on the paddle. \u201cLine the\nball up with your paddle\u201d he said,picking the ball up and placing it directly\non the paddle \u201cand then when you throw it up, don\u2019t take your eyes off it, the\nrest will just happen\u201d \u00a0He took a step back and watched as Anna did what\nhe told her. It worked and Anna hit the ball across the room. </p><p>\u201cAyy\u201d he smiled\n\u201cThat\u2019s it love. Now\u201d he picked up his own paddle again \u201cIt\u2019s game on\u201d </p><p>He picked the ball up\nagain and threw it back to her so that she could serve it. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t going\neasy on her, his competitive side was definitely shining as the crew all\ngathered around to watch. </p><p>\u201cCome on Anna,\u201d Clare\ncalled when the score was even. \u201cFinish him off!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d\nHarry smirked and hit the ball to Anna\u2019s left, so hard that she missed it and\nit fell to the floor. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he shrugged</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d she\nmoved around to his side of the table and wrapped her arms around him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d he\nplaced a kiss onto her forehead \u201cI have to go get ready now, you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a nap on that couch while you do your thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou feeling ok?\u201d he\nasked taking her hand and heading towards the dressing rooms </p><p>\u201cNot wonderful, but\nI\u2019m ok\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Madison Square\nGarden, night two. Anna was standing in the crew area near the b-stage, with\nAnne right next to her and they were both emotional. Anne had been crying\npretty much all night and Anna couldn\u2019t help but smile up at Harry on the\nstage. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do an\nextra one for you tonight\u201d Harry said into the mic and the crowd went wild.\nAnna knew exactly what was coming, one of her favourites parts about this tour\nwas watching the soundcheck every night. It reminded her of the night they met\nand the way that he\u2019d smile at her from up there still gave her butterflies,\nand she guessed that was a good thing. </p><p>\u201cThis was the first\nsong he knew all the words to\u201d Anne smiled, placing her hand over her heart as\nhe began singing Shania Twain\u2019s \u2018<i>Still the One</i>\u2019 \u201cand now look at him\u201d </p><p>\u201cLooks like he made\nit Anne,\u201d Anna wrapped her arm around Anne\u2019s shoulder and they both started\nswaying along to the music. As she watched Harry up on the stage she couldn\u2019t\nhelp but picture him as a three or four year old sitting in the back of his\nmum\u2019s car mumbling along to the song, making up his own phrases for the ones\nthat he couldn&rsquo;t quite make out or understand and she felt an enormous sense of\npride. She\u2019d only known him for a few months, but she couldn\u2019t help but see how\nfar he\u2019d come, from being that little boy that sang along to his mum&rsquo;s\nfavourite songs in the back of the car, to standing on stage at Madison Square\nGarden singing not only the entirety of his album but also the songs that got\nhim there to a sold out room with just about every person singing those lyrics\nback. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t looking\nout into the crowd much but when he did, he was looking for Anna, but he\ncouldn\u2019t see her because of the stage lights. </p><p><i>Ain&rsquo;t\nnothin&rsquo; better</i></p><p><i>We\nbeat the odds together</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m\nglad we didn&rsquo;t listen</i></p><p><i>Look\nat what we would be missin</i>&rsquo;</p><p>Anna\nstewed on those lyrics for a second. She still didn\u2019t really know what Harry\nwas to her, but he wouldn\u2019t be anything if she listened to Ronnie. Imagine if\nshe did, she would be sleeping alone in her London flat, without ever having\nexperienced Harry on tour and that wasn\u2019t something she wanted to think about. \u00a0In some ways, Anna was glad that\nit took as long as it did for their paths to cross, but it baffled her that it\ndidn\u2019t happen before then. Her and Harry grew up parallel to each other, in\nopposite towns, doing the same things with their time but Anna spent all her\ntime with Ronnie and maybe she shouldn\u2019t have. </p><p>The\nfinal notes of the song echoed around the arena and Anne turned and hugged Anna.\n</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou dear,\u201d she said trying to choke back tears \u201cit\u2019s been a long time since\nI\u2019ve seen him this happy\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall him Anne\u201d Anna really didn\u2019t think that Anne should be thanking her, she\nhadn\u2019t really done anything. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\nshe wiped a tear away \u201cno love, you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell\nI\u2019m having the best time being on tour with him\u201d Anna smiled, and it was true,\nthese last few weeks had been the most fun she\u2019d had in years. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na wonderful girl Anna, your mum must be so proud\u201d </p><p>Anna\nsmiled at Anne but she didn\u2019t say anything, because if she was honest, she\ndidn\u2019t know if her mum was proud of \u00a0her, she was supportive as hell and\nallowed her to do what she thought was best, but she wasn\u2019t sure that proud was\nan emotion her mother felt towards her. </p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go backstage now dear\u201d Anne put her hand on Anna\u2019s shoulder while Harry\nintroduced Kiwi, pulling her away from her thoughts. They ducked out of the\nbooth and snuck backstage together while the crowd was distracted enough not to\nnotice and as the made their way through the hallways it dawned on Anna that\nshe hadn\u2019t checked her phone all day, she couldn\u2019t even remember where she put\nit but she guessed that it was somewhere in Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to wait near the stage dear, to meet him when he comes off\u201d Anne said,\nturning down the hallway that lead to the stage area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to\nfind my phone and I\u2019ll meet you there\u201d Anna turned on her heel and opened the\ndoor to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Her phone was sitting\non the table buzzing like crazy, which was odd because it was the early hours\nof the morning in the UK and she didn\u2019t have anyone in the US that would be\ntrying to contact her. She picked it up and saw thousands of twitter\nnotifications and furrowed her brow as she unlocked her phone. No one ever\ntweeted her, she got the occasional mention from one of her blogger friends,\nbut other than that it was pretty quiet, her followers mostly interacted on\ninstagram or directly on her blog. </p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck\u201d she\nbreathed when she saw what it was. Pictures of her and Harry, snuggled up in\nCentral Park. This is exactly what she was trying to avoid, it would get her\nattention for all of the wrong reasons and the last thing she wanted was for\nHarry\u2019s fans to get the wrong idea about her. Her name was trending at #3 and\nshe\u2019d gained thousands of new followers across all of her social media but she\nrefused to check the comments, she didn&rsquo;t want to know what people were saying\nabout her. </p><p>Her head was\nspinning, she felt ill again and she had to find Harry. She pushed the door\nopen and the hallway was crowded again which she knew meant the show was over\nand she maneuvered herself through the crew members without looking up. </p><p>\u201cWhoa\u201d an unfamiliar\nvoice sounded and someone grabbed her shoulder \u201cslow down, you\u2019re going to run\ninto someone\u201d </p><p>Anna looked up to see\nCamille Rowe standing in front of her, holding onto her shoulder, a smile\nspread across her face.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met you,\nare you new to the crew?\u201d she said, her tone overly sweet</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said bluntly\n\u201cHarry and I are dating.\u201d This wasn\u2019t entirely true, they\u2019d been on a few\ndates, but nothing was official yet</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Camille seemed\nshocked by this and that made Anna wonder if Harry had really broken up with\nher like he said he did on their first date. Before she had a chance to say\nanything more though, Jeff stepped past them on his way to see Harry and Anna\npulled him aside. </p><p>\u201cJeffy\u201d she said and\nCamille scoffed at the nickname. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d </p><p>Anna handed him her\nphone and his face fell the minute he saw the pictures. </p><p>\u201cDoes H know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead \u201cthey must have come out while he was on stage\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell\nhim or should I?\u201d he handed her the phone back </p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d Anna\nsmiled hopefully at him. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then\u201d he\nsmiled and then pointed to Camille \u201cHow did you get back here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe door\u201d she said\nsarcastically. </p><p>\u201cJoe\u201d Jeff said the\nthe security guard that was standing within ear shot \u201cshe\u2019s not on the list\nanymore\u201d </p>",

Not that she cared that much about\nbeing linked to him, but she understood why he wanted to keep it quiet for now.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t live our\nlives under a rock, sooner or later,they\u2019re going to find out.\u201d The park\nappeared in their view and Harry picked up Anna\u2019s bag before she had the chance\nto fight him on it, \u201cand I want to take you to Central Park, so I guess it will\nbe sooner\u201d he placed a kiss on her forehead and paid the taxi driver using his\ncard.</p>[[MORE]]<p>They stepped out of\nthe cab and Anna felt her stomach drop as she realised how many young girls\nwere hanging around the area. It didn\u2019t seem to phase Harry though, he simply\nheld onto Anna\u2019s hand, without a care who saw it. They walked along in silence\nfor a while, until they got to the spot where they were meant to meet Mitch and\nSarah and much to Anna\u2019s surprise, not one person stopped them, she did catch a\nfew people doing the same double take that the taxi driver had when they got\ninto the car, but no one seemed to care that he was with her. </p><p>\u201cThis seems like a\nnice spot,\u201d Harry said, sitting himself down on an open patch of grass, basking\nin the sunlight.</p><p>Anna joined him,\nsitting cross legged by his side. \u201cHow late are we thinking Mitch and Sarah\nwill be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf Mitch has any say\nin it, they\u2019ll be on time, but I don\u2019t think Mitch gets a say\u201d Harry laughed </p><p>Anna nodded \u201cI think\nyou might be wrong there\u201d, she pointed towards the two figures walking towards\nthem. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mitch I\nsaid that!\u201d he whispered into her ear as he stood up to greet them. Anna was\nnervous not only about getting spotted and ambushed by Harry\u2019s fans, but also\nabout spending this much time with Sarah. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like her,\nit was quite the opposite actually, she really wanted to be friends with her,\nbut she found her intimidating and even more so when Mitch was around. In the\nthree weeks that Anna had spent on tour with Harry so far, she had gotten close\nwith Clare and even Helene, but she hadn\u2019t been able to talk to Sarah. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an amazing\nhotdog stand not far from here\u201d Mitch said as Anna tuned back into the\nconversation.\u201cThey even have vegan options,\u201d he looked at Sarah knowing there\nwas no way she\u2019d be eating a hot dog, or letting him for that matter. </p><p>\u201cWell I did promise\nAnna the full New York experience\u201d Harry said looking at Anna </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that\nhungry,\u201d she admitted \u201cI\u2019ll just have some of yours\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at her,\na little concerned by the lack of food she\u2019d eaten over the last few days. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she smiled\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just can\u2019t eat a hot dog that big\u201d </p><p>A smile stretched\nacross Mitch\u2019s face \u201cYou sure about that Anna?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s cheeks flushed\nred and she rolled her eyes at him as Harry cackled at the joke. </p><p>\u201cShould we go then?\u201d\nSarah interrupted looking at Anna with a smile. The boys nodded and Harry\ngrabbed Anna\u2019s hand once again. Jokes like that didn\u2019t usually bother Anna, but\nher and Harry were yet to sleep together, in fact, it had been almost a year\nsince Anna had slept with anyone, and the last thing she wanted was for it to\nbe awkward when it finally happened with Harry. </p><p>The hotdog stand sat\nnear a bridge and more open grass, but there were a lot more people around and\none of them, just happened to recognise Harry. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d the girl\nsaid as she got closer to them. </p><p>He held onto Anna\u2019s\nhand a little tighter, which is the last thing she expected him to do, she\nfigured if any fan even looked at them then he would drop her hand.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said softly,\nnot wanting to be rude, but suddenly very aware that this was the first time\nhe\u2019d ever been out in public with Anna. </p><p>\u201cOh my god it is you,\nI wasn\u2019t sure if it was, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be in Central Park\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen in town..\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cWhat\u2019s your name love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d she said,\ntears forming in her eyes \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan since the beginning, shit I never\nthought I\u2019d get to meet \u00a0you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nsmiled and dropped Anna\u2019s hand, opening his arms to hug the girl \u201cbring it in\u201d\nhe said and she did, she hugged him as the tears spilled out of her eyes and he\nwouldn\u2019t let go until she did. </p><p>\u201cCan I get a photo?\u201d\nshe asked as she pulled away, carelessly shoving her phone into Anna\u2019s hand.\nShe was a little taken aback by the gesture, but she took the shots anyway, as\nboth Harry and the girl smiled for the camera. Sarah and Mitch had ducked away\nto avoid taking photos too and were already busy getting their food, so Anna\nstood awkwardly as Harry said goodbye. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he said once\nshe was out of earshot \u201cShe didn\u2019t even notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople are going to\ncare eventually Harry\u201d Anna took his hand again </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me\u201d\nhe leant down and kissed her cheek \u201cnow are you sure you don\u2019t want anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get\nhot dogs, we can get something else if you\u2019d prefer?\u201d He knew she hadn\u2019t eaten\nmuch breakfast this morning and he was starting to get worried about her. </p><p>\u201cHot dogs are fine\nHaz, I\u2019ll have a bite of yours but I\u2019m really not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat\nbreakfast\u201d he said looking concerned </p><p>\u201cI had a banana\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t count, what\u2019s\ngoing on love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently I don\u2019t\ndeal well with jetlag\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cWe can go\nhome and nap if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet your food first\u201d\nshe smiled. </p><p>If she was honest,\nshe was over the jetlag, it had been three weeks, but the constant travel was\ngetting to her and now that her and Harry were sharing a room, she was having\ntrouble sleeping, she wasn\u2019t used to having someone sleeping next to her and\nHarry snored louder than she thought humanly possible. She wasn\u2019t hungry\nbecause she was tired and she was tired because she needed her space, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to be away from Harry. </p><p>Mitch and Sarah had\nalready sat down in a shady spot under a tree and were quite content with each\nother. Harry looked at Anna and then at his two bandmates and back to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy over\nthere, let\u2019s go home and we\u2019ll order something in\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Anna had woken up\nfeeling wonderful this morning, but by the time 6pm rolled around she was\nfeeling ill again and she had no idea why. She slept like a baby last night and\nshe\u2019d even eaten breakfast, which isn\u2019t something she did when she was home,\nshe usually skipped straight to lunch but this morning Harry had insisted on\ncooking her breakfast and she had to admit he was a pretty good cook. \u00a0</p><p>But it was 6:30 pm\nnow and she was sitting backstage at Madison Square Garden, her laptop open to\na blank document, sipping on a green tea, hoping that it would make her feel\nbetter, or at least inspire her to write something. Since being on tour with\nHarry her blog had taken a backseat, she had a lot to write about and things\nshe\u2019d love to share with her followers, but she couldn\u2019t because no one knew\nthere was anything going on with her and Harry. Of course there were the few\nfans that had their suspicions, but no one believed that they were actually\ndating, as far as his fandom was concerned, he was still with Camille and Anna\nwas happy to leave it at that for a little while longer but that did make it\nhard for her to write blog posts about her travels. She didn\u2019t doubt that those\nwith suspicions would compare her itinerary to Harry\u2019s and realise that it was\nexactly the same. </p><p>\u201cClarrrre\u201d Anna\nmoaned as Clare sat down next to her </p><p>\u201cAnnnnna\u201d she\nmimicked Anna\u2019s tone and rested her head on the table. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have\nanything to write about!\u201d </p><p>Clare sat up and\nlooked around the room \u201cPing Pong,\u201d she laughed and \u00a0pointed at the rather\nintense ping pong competition that Harry had organised. </p><p>Anna thought for a\nminute, \u201cI think too many Harry fans know about the ping pong thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Clare said.\n\u201cThey also think he was dating Camille\u201d </p><p>\u201cI like that it\u2019s our\nsecret for now,\u201d she admitted. </p><p>\u201cHe really likes you\nAnna\u201d Clare said, lowering her voice so that no one could hear them \u201cI\u2019ve only\nknown him for two years, but I\u2019ve never seen him act the way he does around\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it\nstrange that he had Camille on the first half of the tour and now I\u2019m here?\u201d\nThis was something that Anna hadn\u2019t really been able to let go of, as much as\nshe liked Harry, she couldn\u2019t help but see Ronnie\u2019s point, she was just a tour\nbuddy, once it all ends and he can go back to his normal life Anna would be\nforgotten about. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much\nabout what happened between them\u201d Clare admitted \u201cbut I know that for most of\nthe European leg, he did whatever he could to avoid being alone with her and\nafter that she disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe told me it was\nall sex\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re here now An, I think he likes you enough to try\nand make it work, but he had the next few months of his life already set out\nfor him and the only way he could make it work with you is to have you here\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou might be right\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be\ninvasive or anything, but have you two had sex yet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna blushed\n\u201cthere\u2019s been a few times when it could have happened but we both made excuses\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d Clare\nnodded \u201cmeans there\u2019s more to the relationship, but don\u2019t let it go to long\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly my\nfault, I keep chickening out\u201d as close as she\u2019d gotten to Clare over the last\nfew weeks, this was the first time they\u2019d spoken about anything like this and\nshe felt a little weird about it considering Harry was technically Clare\u2019s\nboss. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she didn\u2019t\nseem phased by the conversation. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a\nyear\u201d Anna hid her face in her hands \u201cwhat if they\u2019ve changed it?\u201d</p><p>Clare giggled and put\nher hand on Anna\u2019s back, \u201cI assure you, it hasn\u2019t changed\u201d </p><p>\u201cOi Elliot\u201d, Harry\ncalled across the room bringing their conversation to an end as Anna turned\naround to face him. </p><p>\u201cOi Styles\u201d Anna\ncalled back, a grin on her face </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up love,\u201d he\ntwisted the ping pong bat in his hand and picked up the other one,holding it\nout to her</p><p>She shut her laptop\nand stood up, making her way towards him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve\nplayed ping pong since I was about 10,\u201d she said taking the bat off him </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d he\nwinked at her and Clare started giggling from the sidelines \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into\nher?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cOh, we were just\nhaving a chat\u201d, Anna smiled \u201cNow it\u2019s game on Styles.\u201d </p><p>Harry had his game\nface on, and so did Anna, even though she\u2019s avoided ping pong at all costs\nsince the beginning of the tour. Sports had never been her thing and she didn\u2019t\nwant to embarrass herself in front of him but today was different. She knew how\nnervous he was about this show and she thought that maybe this would keep him\ndistracted before he had to go on stage. </p><p>\u201cYou call that a\ntrick shot Styles?\u201d Anna said as she hit the ball back to him </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, he smirked \u201cI\u2019m\nbeing gentle\u201d and with that he used all the power in his right hand to hit the\nball back to Anna. She hadn\u2019t been expecting it to be going so fast so when she\nswung her arm, she missed, the little orange ball sped right past her and Harry\nburst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened to\nbeing gentle?\u201d she pouted as she turned around to fetch the ball. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not going\nto just let you win love\u201d he shrugged \u201cso are we going to play properly? Or are\nyou forfeiting now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give up that\neasily\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he\nlaughed \u201cI seem to remember you giving up on uni pretty easily\u201d </p><p>Anna gritted her\nteeth through a giggle \u201cOh it\u2019s on Styles\u201d </p><p>She threw the ball up\nto serve but missed on the swing. Harry raised his eyebrows and held back a\nlaugh but he didn\u2019t say anything, he simply put his bat down and walked around\nthe table so that he was standing behind Anna. </p><p>\u201cLet me show you\u201d he\nwrapped his arms around her and adjusted her hands on the paddle. \u201cLine the\nball up with your paddle\u201d he said,picking the ball up and placing it directly\non the paddle \u201cand then when you throw it up, don\u2019t take your eyes off it, the\nrest will just happen\u201d \u00a0He took a step back and watched as Anna did what\nhe told her. It worked and Anna hit the ball across the room. </p><p>\u201cAyy\u201d he smiled\n\u201cThat\u2019s it love. Now\u201d he picked up his own paddle again \u201cIt\u2019s game on\u201d </p><p>He picked the ball up\nagain and threw it back to her so that she could serve it. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t going\neasy on her, his competitive side was definitely shining as the crew all\ngathered around to watch. </p><p>\u201cCome on Anna,\u201d Clare\ncalled when the score was even. \u201cFinish him off!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d\nHarry smirked and hit the ball to Anna\u2019s left, so hard that she missed it and\nit fell to the floor. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he shrugged</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d she\nmoved around to his side of the table and wrapped her arms around him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d he\nplaced a kiss onto her forehead \u201cI have to go get ready now, you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a nap on that couch while you do your thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou feeling ok?\u201d he\nasked taking her hand and heading towards the dressing rooms </p><p>\u201cNot wonderful, but\nI\u2019m ok\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Madison Square\nGarden, night two. Anna was standing in the crew area near the b-stage, with\nAnne right next to her and they were both emotional. Anne had been crying\npretty much all night and Anna couldn\u2019t help but smile up at Harry on the\nstage. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do an\nextra one for you tonight\u201d Harry said into the mic and the crowd went wild.\nAnna knew exactly what was coming, one of her favourites parts about this tour\nwas watching the soundcheck every night. It reminded her of the night they met\nand the way that he\u2019d smile at her from up there still gave her butterflies,\nand she guessed that was a good thing. </p><p>\u201cThis was the first\nsong he knew all the words to\u201d Anne smiled, placing her hand over her heart as\nhe began singing Shania Twain\u2019s \u2018<i>Still the One</i>\u2019 \u201cand now look at him\u201d </p><p>\u201cLooks like he made\nit Anne,\u201d Anna wrapped her arm around Anne\u2019s shoulder and they both started\nswaying along to the music. As she watched Harry up on the stage she couldn\u2019t\nhelp but picture him as a three or four year old sitting in the back of his\nmum\u2019s car mumbling along to the song, making up his own phrases for the ones\nthat he couldn\u2019t quite make out or understand and she felt an enormous sense of\npride. She\u2019d only known him for a few months, but she couldn\u2019t help but see how\nfar he\u2019d come, from being that little boy that sang along to his mum\u2019s\nfavourite songs in the back of the car, to standing on stage at Madison Square\nGarden singing not only the entirety of his album but also the songs that got\nhim there to a sold out room with just about every person singing those lyrics\nback. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t looking\nout into the crowd much but when he did, he was looking for Anna, but he\ncouldn\u2019t see her because of the stage lights. </p><p><i>Ain\u2019t\nnothin\u2019 better</i></p><p><i>We\nbeat the odds together</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m\nglad we didn\u2019t listen</i></p><p><i>Look\nat what we would be missin</i>\u2019</p><p>Anna\nstewed on those lyrics for a second. She still didn\u2019t really know what Harry\nwas to her, but he wouldn\u2019t be anything if she listened to Ronnie. Imagine if\nshe did, she would be sleeping alone in her London flat, without ever having\nexperienced Harry on tour and that wasn\u2019t something she wanted to think about. \u00a0In some ways, Anna was glad that\nit took as long as it did for their paths to cross, but it baffled her that it\ndidn\u2019t happen before then. Her and Harry grew up parallel to each other, in\nopposite towns, doing the same things with their time but Anna spent all her\ntime with Ronnie and maybe she shouldn\u2019t have. </p><p>The\nfinal notes of the song echoed around the arena and Anne turned and hugged Anna.\n</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou dear,\u201d she said trying to choke back tears \u201cit\u2019s been a long time since\nI\u2019ve seen him this happy\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall him Anne\u201d Anna really didn\u2019t think that Anne should be thanking her, she\nhadn\u2019t really done anything. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\nshe wiped a tear away \u201cno love, you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell\nI\u2019m having the best time being on tour with him\u201d Anna smiled, and it was true,\nthese last few weeks had been the most fun she\u2019d had in years. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na wonderful girl Anna, your mum must be so proud\u201d </p><p>Anna\nsmiled at Anne but she didn\u2019t say anything, because if she was honest, she\ndidn\u2019t know if her mum was proud of \u00a0her, she was supportive as hell and\nallowed her to do what she thought was best, but she wasn\u2019t sure that proud was\nan emotion her mother felt towards her. </p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go backstage now dear\u201d Anne put her hand on Anna\u2019s shoulder while Harry\nintroduced Kiwi, pulling her away from her thoughts. They ducked out of the\nbooth and snuck backstage together while the crowd was distracted enough not to\nnotice and as the made their way through the hallways it dawned on Anna that\nshe hadn\u2019t checked her phone all day, she couldn\u2019t even remember where she put\nit but she guessed that it was somewhere in Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to wait near the stage dear, to meet him when he comes off\u201d Anne said,\nturning down the hallway that lead to the stage area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to\nfind my phone and I\u2019ll meet you there\u201d Anna turned on her heel and opened the\ndoor to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Her phone was sitting\non the table buzzing like crazy, which was odd because it was the early hours\nof the morning in the UK and she didn\u2019t have anyone in the US that would be\ntrying to contact her. She picked it up and saw thousands of twitter\nnotifications and furrowed her brow as she unlocked her phone. No one ever\ntweeted her, she got the occasional mention from one of her blogger friends,\nbut other than that it was pretty quiet, her followers mostly interacted on\ninstagram or directly on her blog. </p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck\u201d she\nbreathed when she saw what it was. Pictures of her and Harry, snuggled up in\nCentral Park. This is exactly what she was trying to avoid, it would get her\nattention for all of the wrong reasons and the last thing she wanted was for\nHarry\u2019s fans to get the wrong idea about her. Her name was trending at #3 and\nshe\u2019d gained thousands of new followers across all of her social media but she\nrefused to check the comments, she didn\u2019t want to know what people were saying\nabout her. </p><p>Her head was\nspinning, she felt ill again and she had to find Harry. She pushed the door\nopen and the hallway was crowded again which she knew meant the show was over\nand she maneuvered herself through the crew members without looking up. </p><p>\u201cWhoa\u201d an unfamiliar\nvoice sounded and someone grabbed her shoulder \u201cslow down, you\u2019re going to run\ninto someone\u201d </p><p>Anna looked up to see\nCamille Rowe standing in front of her, holding onto her shoulder, a smile\nspread across her face.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met you,\nare you new to the crew?\u201d she said, her tone overly sweet</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said bluntly\n\u201cHarry and I are dating.\u201d This wasn\u2019t entirely true, they\u2019d been on a few\ndates, but nothing was official yet</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Camille seemed\nshocked by this and that made Anna wonder if Harry had really broken up with\nher like he said he did on their first date. Before she had a chance to say\nanything more though, Jeff stepped past them on his way to see Harry and Anna\npulled him aside. </p><p>\u201cJeffy\u201d she said and\nCamille scoffed at the nickname. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d </p><p>Anna handed him her\nphone and his face fell the minute he saw the pictures. </p><p>\u201cDoes H know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead \u201cthey must have come out while he was on stage\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell\nhim or should I?\u201d he handed her the phone back </p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d Anna\nsmiled hopefully at him. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then\u201d he\nsmiled and then pointed to Camille \u201cHow did you get back here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe door\u201d she said\nsarcastically. </p><p>\u201cJoe\u201d Jeff said the\nthe security guard that was standing within ear shot \u201cshe\u2019s not on the list\nanymore\u201d </p></p>",

Not that she cared that much about\nbeing linked to him, but she understood why he wanted to keep it quiet for now.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t live our\nlives under a rock, sooner or later,they\u2019re going to find out.\u201d The park\nappeared in their view and Harry picked up Anna\u2019s bag before she had the chance\nto fight him on it, \u201cand I want to take you to Central Park, so I guess it will\nbe sooner\u201d he placed a kiss on her forehead and paid the taxi driver using his\ncard.</p>[[MORE]]<p>They stepped out of\nthe cab and Anna felt her stomach drop as she realised how many young girls\nwere hanging around the area. It didn\u2019t seem to phase Harry though, he simply\nheld onto Anna\u2019s hand, without a care who saw it. They walked along in silence\nfor a while, until they got to the spot where they were meant to meet Mitch and\nSarah and much to Anna\u2019s surprise, not one person stopped them, she did catch a\nfew people doing the same double take that the taxi driver had when they got\ninto the car, but no one seemed to care that he was with her. </p><p>\u201cThis seems like a\nnice spot,\u201d Harry said, sitting himself down on an open patch of grass, basking\nin the sunlight.</p><p>Anna joined him,\nsitting cross legged by his side. \u201cHow late are we thinking Mitch and Sarah\nwill be?\u201d </p><p>\u201cIf Mitch has any say\nin it, they\u2019ll be on time, but I don\u2019t think Mitch gets a say\u201d Harry laughed </p><p>Anna nodded \u201cI think\nyou might be wrong there\u201d, she pointed towards the two figures walking towards\nthem. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mitch I\nsaid that!\u201d he whispered into her ear as he stood up to greet them. Anna was\nnervous not only about getting spotted and ambushed by Harry\u2019s fans, but also\nabout spending this much time with Sarah. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like her,\nit was quite the opposite actually, she really wanted to be friends with her,\nbut she found her intimidating and even more so when Mitch was around. In the\nthree weeks that Anna had spent on tour with Harry so far, she had gotten close\nwith Clare and even Helene, but she hadn\u2019t been able to talk to Sarah. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an amazing\nhotdog stand not far from here\u201d Mitch said as Anna tuned back into the\nconversation.\u201cThey even have vegan options,\u201d he looked at Sarah knowing there\nwas no way she\u2019d be eating a hot dog, or letting him for that matter. </p><p>\u201cWell I did promise\nAnna the full New York experience\u201d Harry said looking at Anna </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that\nhungry,\u201d she admitted \u201cI\u2019ll just have some of yours\u201d </p><p>Harry looked at her,\na little concerned by the lack of food she\u2019d eaten over the last few days. </p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she smiled\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just can\u2019t eat a hot dog that big\u201d </p><p>A smile stretched\nacross Mitch\u2019s face \u201cYou sure about that Anna?\u201d </p><p>Anna\u2019s cheeks flushed\nred and she rolled her eyes at him as Harry cackled at the joke. </p><p>\u201cShould we go then?\u201d\nSarah interrupted looking at Anna with a smile. The boys nodded and Harry\ngrabbed Anna\u2019s hand once again. Jokes like that didn\u2019t usually bother Anna, but\nher and Harry were yet to sleep together, in fact, it had been almost a year\nsince Anna had slept with anyone, and the last thing she wanted was for it to\nbe awkward when it finally happened with Harry. </p><p>The hotdog stand sat\nnear a bridge and more open grass, but there were a lot more people around and\none of them, just happened to recognise Harry. </p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d the girl\nsaid as she got closer to them. </p><p>He held onto Anna\u2019s\nhand a little tighter, which is the last thing she expected him to do, she\nfigured if any fan even looked at them then he would drop her hand.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said softly,\nnot wanting to be rude, but suddenly very aware that this was the first time\nhe\u2019d ever been out in public with Anna. </p><p>\u201cOh my god it is you,\nI wasn\u2019t sure if it was, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be in Central Park\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhen in town..\u201d he\nsmiled \u201cWhat\u2019s your name love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d she said,\ntears forming in her eyes \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan since the beginning, shit I never\nthought I\u2019d get to meet \u00a0you\u201d </p><p>\u201cThank you\u201d Harry\nsmiled and dropped Anna\u2019s hand, opening his arms to hug the girl \u201cbring it in\u201d\nhe said and she did, she hugged him as the tears spilled out of her eyes and he\nwouldn\u2019t let go until she did. </p><p>\u201cCan I get a photo?\u201d\nshe asked as she pulled away, carelessly shoving her phone into Anna\u2019s hand.\nShe was a little taken aback by the gesture, but she took the shots anyway, as\nboth Harry and the girl smiled for the camera. Sarah and Mitch had ducked away\nto avoid taking photos too and were already busy getting their food, so Anna\nstood awkwardly as Harry said goodbye. </p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he said once\nshe was out of earshot \u201cShe didn\u2019t even notice\u201d </p><p>\u201cPeople are going to\ncare eventually Harry\u201d Anna took his hand again </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me\u201d\nhe leant down and kissed her cheek \u201cnow are you sure you don\u2019t want anything?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to get\nhot dogs, we can get something else if you\u2019d prefer?\u201d He knew she hadn\u2019t eaten\nmuch breakfast this morning and he was starting to get worried about her. </p><p>\u201cHot dogs are fine\nHaz, I\u2019ll have a bite of yours but I\u2019m really not hungry\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat\nbreakfast\u201d he said looking concerned </p><p>\u201cI had a banana\u201d </p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t count, what\u2019s\ngoing on love?\u201d </p><p>\u201cApparently I don\u2019t\ndeal well with jetlag\u201d </p><p>He nodded \u201cWe can go\nhome and nap if you want?\u201d </p><p>\u201cGet your food first\u201d\nshe smiled. </p><p>If she was honest,\nshe was over the jetlag, it had been three weeks, but the constant travel was\ngetting to her and now that her and Harry were sharing a room, she was having\ntrouble sleeping, she wasn\u2019t used to having someone sleeping next to her and\nHarry snored louder than she thought humanly possible. She wasn\u2019t hungry\nbecause she was tired and she was tired because she needed her space, but she\ndidn\u2019t want to be away from Harry. </p><p>Mitch and Sarah had\nalready sat down in a shady spot under a tree and were quite content with each\nother. Harry looked at Anna and then at his two bandmates and back to Anna. </p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re happy over\nthere, let\u2019s go home and we\u2019ll order something in\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Anna had woken up\nfeeling wonderful this morning, but by the time 6pm rolled around she was\nfeeling ill again and she had no idea why. She slept like a baby last night and\nshe\u2019d even eaten breakfast, which isn\u2019t something she did when she was home,\nshe usually skipped straight to lunch but this morning Harry had insisted on\ncooking her breakfast and she had to admit he was a pretty good cook. \u00a0</p><p>But it was 6:30 pm\nnow and she was sitting backstage at Madison Square Garden, her laptop open to\na blank document, sipping on a green tea, hoping that it would make her feel\nbetter, or at least inspire her to write something. Since being on tour with\nHarry her blog had taken a backseat, she had a lot to write about and things\nshe\u2019d love to share with her followers, but she couldn\u2019t because no one knew\nthere was anything going on with her and Harry. Of course there were the few\nfans that had their suspicions, but no one believed that they were actually\ndating, as far as his fandom was concerned, he was still with Camille and Anna\nwas happy to leave it at that for a little while longer but that did make it\nhard for her to write blog posts about her travels. She didn\u2019t doubt that those\nwith suspicions would compare her itinerary to Harry\u2019s and realise that it was\nexactly the same. </p><p>\u201cClarrrre\u201d Anna\nmoaned as Clare sat down next to her </p><p>\u201cAnnnnna\u201d she\nmimicked Anna\u2019s tone and rested her head on the table. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have\nanything to write about!\u201d </p><p>Clare sat up and\nlooked around the room \u201cPing Pong,\u201d she laughed and \u00a0pointed at the rather\nintense ping pong competition that Harry had organised. </p><p>Anna thought for a\nminute, \u201cI think too many Harry fans know about the ping pong thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Clare said.\n\u201cThey also think he was dating Camille\u201d </p><p>\u201cI like that it\u2019s our\nsecret for now,\u201d she admitted. </p><p>\u201cHe really likes you\nAnna\u201d Clare said, lowering her voice so that no one could hear them \u201cI\u2019ve only\nknown him for two years, but I\u2019ve never seen him act the way he does around\nyou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you find it\nstrange that he had Camille on the first half of the tour and now I\u2019m here?\u201d\nThis was something that Anna hadn\u2019t really been able to let go of, as much as\nshe liked Harry, she couldn\u2019t help but see Ronnie\u2019s point, she was just a tour\nbuddy, once it all ends and he can go back to his normal life Anna would be\nforgotten about. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much\nabout what happened between them\u201d Clare admitted \u201cbut I know that for most of\nthe European leg, he did whatever he could to avoid being alone with her and\nafter that she disappeared.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHe told me it was\nall sex\u201d </p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re here now An, I think he likes you enough to try\nand make it work, but he had the next few months of his life already set out\nfor him and the only way he could make it work with you is to have you here\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou might be right\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be\ninvasive or anything, but have you two had sex yet?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna blushed\n\u201cthere\u2019s been a few times when it could have happened but we both made excuses\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d Clare\nnodded \u201cmeans there\u2019s more to the relationship, but don\u2019t let it go to long\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly my\nfault, I keep chickening out\u201d as close as she\u2019d gotten to Clare over the last\nfew weeks, this was the first time they\u2019d spoken about anything like this and\nshe felt a little weird about it considering Harry was technically Clare\u2019s\nboss. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she didn\u2019t\nseem phased by the conversation. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a\nyear\u201d Anna hid her face in her hands \u201cwhat if they\u2019ve changed it?\u201d</p><p>Clare giggled and put\nher hand on Anna\u2019s back, \u201cI assure you, it hasn\u2019t changed\u201d </p><p>\u201cOi Elliot\u201d, Harry\ncalled across the room bringing their conversation to an end as Anna turned\naround to face him. </p><p>\u201cOi Styles\u201d Anna\ncalled back, a grin on her face </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up love,\u201d he\ntwisted the ping pong bat in his hand and picked up the other one,holding it\nout to her</p><p>She shut her laptop\nand stood up, making her way towards him. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve\nplayed ping pong since I was about 10,\u201d she said taking the bat off him </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d he\nwinked at her and Clare started giggling from the sidelines \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into\nher?\u201d he asked </p><p>\u201cOh, we were just\nhaving a chat\u201d, Anna smiled \u201cNow it\u2019s game on Styles.\u201d </p><p>Harry had his game\nface on, and so did Anna, even though she\u2019s avoided ping pong at all costs\nsince the beginning of the tour. Sports had never been her thing and she didn\u2019t\nwant to embarrass herself in front of him but today was different. She knew how\nnervous he was about this show and she thought that maybe this would keep him\ndistracted before he had to go on stage. </p><p>\u201cYou call that a\ntrick shot Styles?\u201d Anna said as she hit the ball back to him </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d, he smirked \u201cI\u2019m\nbeing gentle\u201d and with that he used all the power in his right hand to hit the\nball back to Anna. She hadn\u2019t been expecting it to be going so fast so when she\nswung her arm, she missed, the little orange ball sped right past her and Harry\nburst out laughing. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened to\nbeing gentle?\u201d she pouted as she turned around to fetch the ball. </p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not going\nto just let you win love\u201d he shrugged \u201cso are we going to play properly? Or are\nyou forfeiting now?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give up that\neasily\u201d </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d he\nlaughed \u201cI seem to remember you giving up on uni pretty easily\u201d </p><p>Anna gritted her\nteeth through a giggle \u201cOh it\u2019s on Styles\u201d </p><p>She threw the ball up\nto serve but missed on the swing. Harry raised his eyebrows and held back a\nlaugh but he didn\u2019t say anything, he simply put his bat down and walked around\nthe table so that he was standing behind Anna. </p><p>\u201cLet me show you\u201d he\nwrapped his arms around her and adjusted her hands on the paddle. \u201cLine the\nball up with your paddle\u201d he said,picking the ball up and placing it directly\non the paddle \u201cand then when you throw it up, don\u2019t take your eyes off it, the\nrest will just happen\u201d \u00a0He took a step back and watched as Anna did what\nhe told her. It worked and Anna hit the ball across the room. </p><p>\u201cAyy\u201d he smiled\n\u201cThat\u2019s it love. Now\u201d he picked up his own paddle again \u201cIt\u2019s game on\u201d </p><p>He picked the ball up\nagain and threw it back to her so that she could serve it. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t going\neasy on her, his competitive side was definitely shining as the crew all\ngathered around to watch. </p><p>\u201cCome on Anna,\u201d Clare\ncalled when the score was even. \u201cFinish him off!\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d\nHarry smirked and hit the ball to Anna\u2019s left, so hard that she missed it and\nit fell to the floor. </p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he shrugged</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not\u201d she\nmoved around to his side of the table and wrapped her arms around him. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d he\nplaced a kiss onto her forehead \u201cI have to go get ready now, you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u201d she nodded\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a nap on that couch while you do your thing\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou feeling ok?\u201d he\nasked taking her hand and heading towards the dressing rooms </p><p>\u201cNot wonderful, but\nI\u2019m ok\u201d </p><p>*** </p><p>Madison Square\nGarden, night two. Anna was standing in the crew area near the b-stage, with\nAnne right next to her and they were both emotional. Anne had been crying\npretty much all night and Anna couldn\u2019t help but smile up at Harry on the\nstage. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do an\nextra one for you tonight\u201d Harry said into the mic and the crowd went wild.\nAnna knew exactly what was coming, one of her favourites parts about this tour\nwas watching the soundcheck every night. It reminded her of the night they met\nand the way that he\u2019d smile at her from up there still gave her butterflies,\nand she guessed that was a good thing. </p><p>\u201cThis was the first\nsong he knew all the words to\u201d Anne smiled, placing her hand over her heart as\nhe began singing Shania Twain\u2019s \u2018<i>Still the One</i>\u2019 \u201cand now look at him\u201d </p><p>\u201cLooks like he made\nit Anne,\u201d Anna wrapped her arm around Anne\u2019s shoulder and they both started\nswaying along to the music. As she watched Harry up on the stage she couldn\u2019t\nhelp but picture him as a three or four year old sitting in the back of his\nmum\u2019s car mumbling along to the song, making up his own phrases for the ones\nthat he couldn\u2019t quite make out or understand and she felt an enormous sense of\npride. She\u2019d only known him for a few months, but she couldn\u2019t help but see how\nfar he\u2019d come, from being that little boy that sang along to his mum\u2019s\nfavourite songs in the back of the car, to standing on stage at Madison Square\nGarden singing not only the entirety of his album but also the songs that got\nhim there to a sold out room with just about every person singing those lyrics\nback. </p><p>Harry wasn\u2019t looking\nout into the crowd much but when he did, he was looking for Anna, but he\ncouldn\u2019t see her because of the stage lights. </p><p><i>Ain\u2019t\nnothin\u2019 better</i></p><p><i>We\nbeat the odds together</i></p><p><i>I\u2019m\nglad we didn\u2019t listen</i></p><p><i>Look\nat what we would be missin</i>\u2019</p><p>Anna\nstewed on those lyrics for a second. She still didn\u2019t really know what Harry\nwas to her, but he wouldn\u2019t be anything if she listened to Ronnie. Imagine if\nshe did, she would be sleeping alone in her London flat, without ever having\nexperienced Harry on tour and that wasn\u2019t something she wanted to think about. \u00a0In some ways, Anna was glad that\nit took as long as it did for their paths to cross, but it baffled her that it\ndidn\u2019t happen before then. Her and Harry grew up parallel to each other, in\nopposite towns, doing the same things with their time but Anna spent all her\ntime with Ronnie and maybe she shouldn\u2019t have. </p><p>The\nfinal notes of the song echoed around the arena and Anne turned and hugged Anna.\n</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou dear,\u201d she said trying to choke back tears \u201cit\u2019s been a long time since\nI\u2019ve seen him this happy\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\nall him Anne\u201d Anna really didn\u2019t think that Anne should be thanking her, she\nhadn\u2019t really done anything. </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\nshe wiped a tear away \u201cno love, you\u2019ve helped.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell\nI\u2019m having the best time being on tour with him\u201d Anna smiled, and it was true,\nthese last few weeks had been the most fun she\u2019d had in years. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\na wonderful girl Anna, your mum must be so proud\u201d </p><p>Anna\nsmiled at Anne but she didn\u2019t say anything, because if she was honest, she\ndidn\u2019t know if her mum was proud of \u00a0her, she was supportive as hell and\nallowed her to do what she thought was best, but she wasn\u2019t sure that proud was\nan emotion her mother felt towards her. </p><p>\u201cWe\nshould go backstage now dear\u201d Anne put her hand on Anna\u2019s shoulder while Harry\nintroduced Kiwi, pulling her away from her thoughts. They ducked out of the\nbooth and snuck backstage together while the crowd was distracted enough not to\nnotice and as the made their way through the hallways it dawned on Anna that\nshe hadn\u2019t checked her phone all day, she couldn\u2019t even remember where she put\nit but she guessed that it was somewhere in Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngoing to wait near the stage dear, to meet him when he comes off\u201d Anne said,\nturning down the hallway that lead to the stage area. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to\nfind my phone and I\u2019ll meet you there\u201d Anna turned on her heel and opened the\ndoor to Harry\u2019s dressing room. </p><p>Her phone was sitting\non the table buzzing like crazy, which was odd because it was the early hours\nof the morning in the UK and she didn\u2019t have anyone in the US that would be\ntrying to contact her. She picked it up and saw thousands of twitter\nnotifications and furrowed her brow as she unlocked her phone. No one ever\ntweeted her, she got the occasional mention from one of her blogger friends,\nbut other than that it was pretty quiet, her followers mostly interacted on\ninstagram or directly on her blog. </p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck\u201d she\nbreathed when she saw what it was. Pictures of her and Harry, snuggled up in\nCentral Park. This is exactly what she was trying to avoid, it would get her\nattention for all of the wrong reasons and the last thing she wanted was for\nHarry\u2019s fans to get the wrong idea about her. Her name was trending at #3 and\nshe\u2019d gained thousands of new followers across all of her social media but she\nrefused to check the comments, she didn\u2019t want to know what people were saying\nabout her. </p><p>Her head was\nspinning, she felt ill again and she had to find Harry. She pushed the door\nopen and the hallway was crowded again which she knew meant the show was over\nand she maneuvered herself through the crew members without looking up. </p><p>\u201cWhoa\u201d an unfamiliar\nvoice sounded and someone grabbed her shoulder \u201cslow down, you\u2019re going to run\ninto someone\u201d </p><p>Anna looked up to see\nCamille Rowe standing in front of her, holding onto her shoulder, a smile\nspread across her face.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met you,\nare you new to the crew?\u201d she said, her tone overly sweet</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna said bluntly\n\u201cHarry and I are dating.\u201d This wasn\u2019t entirely true, they\u2019d been on a few\ndates, but nothing was official yet</p><p>\u201cOh\u201d Camille seemed\nshocked by this and that made Anna wonder if Harry had really broken up with\nher like he said he did on their first date. Before she had a chance to say\nanything more though, Jeff stepped past them on his way to see Harry and Anna\npulled him aside. </p><p>\u201cJeffy\u201d she said and\nCamille scoffed at the nickname. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d </p><p>Anna handed him her\nphone and his face fell the minute he saw the pictures. </p><p>\u201cDoes H know?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo\u201d Anna shook her\nhead \u201cthey must have come out while he was on stage\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell\nhim or should I?\u201d he handed her the phone back </p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d Anna\nsmiled hopefully at him. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then\u201d he\nsmiled and then pointed to Camille \u201cHow did you get back here?\u201d </p><p>\u201cThe door\u201d she said\nsarcastically. </p><p>\u201cJoe\u201d Jeff said the\nthe security guard that was standing within ear shot \u201cshe\u2019s not on the list\nanymore\u201d </p></p>",

Not that she cared that much about\nbeing linked to him, but she understood why he wanted to keep it quiet for now.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live our\nlives under a rock, sooner or later,they&rsquo;re going to find out.&rdquo; The park\nappeared in their view and Harry picked up Anna&rsquo;s bag before she had the chance\nto fight him on it, &ldquo;and I want to take you to Central Park, so I guess it will\nbe sooner&rdquo; he placed a kiss on her forehead and paid the taxi driver using his\ncard.</p><p>They stepped out of\nthe cab and Anna felt her stomach drop as she realised how many young girls\nwere hanging around the area. It didn&rsquo;t seem to phase Harry though, he simply\nheld onto Anna&rsquo;s hand, without a care who saw it. They walked along in silence\nfor a while, until they got to the spot where they were meant to meet Mitch and\nSarah and much to Anna&rsquo;s surprise, not one person stopped them, she did catch a\nfew people doing the same double take that the taxi driver had when they got\ninto the car, but no one seemed to care that he was with her. </p><p>&ldquo;This seems like a\nnice spot,&rdquo; Harry said, sitting himself down on an open patch of grass, basking\nin the sunlight.</p><p>Anna joined him,\nsitting cross legged by his side. &ldquo;How late are we thinking Mitch and Sarah\nwill be?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If Mitch has any say\nin it, they&rsquo;ll be on time, but I don&rsquo;t think Mitch gets a say&rdquo; Harry laughed </p><p>Anna nodded &ldquo;I think\nyou might be wrong there&rdquo;, she pointed towards the two figures walking towards\nthem. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Mitch I\nsaid that!&rdquo; he whispered into her ear as he stood up to greet them. Anna was\nnervous not only about getting spotted and ambushed by Harry&rsquo;s fans, but also\nabout spending this much time with Sarah. It wasn&rsquo;t that she didn&rsquo;t like her,\nit was quite the opposite actually, she really wanted to be friends with her,\nbut she found her intimidating and even more so when Mitch was around. In the\nthree weeks that Anna had spent on tour with Harry so far, she had gotten close\nwith Clare and even Helene, but she hadn&rsquo;t been able to talk to Sarah. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an amazing\nhotdog stand not far from here&rdquo; Mitch said as Anna tuned back into the\nconversation.&ldquo;They even have vegan options,&rdquo; he looked at Sarah knowing there\nwas no way she&rsquo;d be eating a hot dog, or letting him for that matter. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I did promise\nAnna the full New York experience&rdquo; Harry said looking at Anna </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that\nhungry,&rdquo; she admitted &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have some of yours&rdquo; </p><p>Harry looked at her,\na little concerned by the lack of food she&rsquo;d eaten over the last few days. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she smiled\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, just can&rsquo;t eat a hot dog that big&rdquo; </p><p>A smile stretched\nacross Mitch&rsquo;s face &ldquo;You sure about that Anna?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna&rsquo;s cheeks flushed\nred and she rolled her eyes at him as Harry cackled at the joke. </p><p>&ldquo;Should we go then?&rdquo;\nSarah interrupted looking at Anna with a smile. The boys nodded and Harry\ngrabbed Anna&rsquo;s hand once again. Jokes like that didn&rsquo;t usually bother Anna, but\nher and Harry were yet to sleep together, in fact, it had been almost a year\nsince Anna had slept with anyone, and the last thing she wanted was for it to\nbe awkward when it finally happened with Harry. </p><p>The hotdog stand sat\nnear a bridge and more open grass, but there were a lot more people around and\none of them, just happened to recognise Harry. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry?&rdquo; the girl\nsaid as she got closer to them. </p><p>He held onto Anna&rsquo;s\nhand a little tighter, which is the last thing she expected him to do, she\nfigured if any fan even looked at them then he would drop her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said softly,\nnot wanting to be rude, but suddenly very aware that this was the first time\nhe&rsquo;d ever been out in public with Anna. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god it is you,\nI wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was, didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be in Central Park&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;When in town..&rdquo; he\nsmiled &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jessica,&rdquo; she said,\ntears forming in her eyes &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fan since the beginning, shit I never\nthought I&rsquo;d get to meet &nbsp;you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; Harry\nsmiled and dropped Anna&rsquo;s hand, opening his arms to hug the girl &ldquo;bring it in&rdquo;\nhe said and she did, she hugged him as the tears spilled out of her eyes and he\nwouldn&rsquo;t let go until she did. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I get a photo?&rdquo;\nshe asked as she pulled away, carelessly shoving her phone into Anna&rsquo;s hand.\nShe was a little taken aback by the gesture, but she took the shots anyway, as\nboth Harry and the girl smiled for the camera. Sarah and Mitch had ducked away\nto avoid taking photos too and were already busy getting their food, so Anna\nstood awkwardly as Harry said goodbye. </p><p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said once\nshe was out of earshot &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even notice&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;People are going to\ncare eventually Harry&rdquo; Anna took his hand again </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine by me&rdquo;\nhe leant down and kissed her cheek &ldquo;now are you sure you don&rsquo;t want anything?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she nodded\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to get\nhot dogs, we can get something else if you&rsquo;d prefer?&rdquo; He knew she hadn&rsquo;t eaten\nmuch breakfast this morning and he was starting to get worried about her. </p><p>&ldquo;Hot dogs are fine\nHaz, I&rsquo;ll have a bite of yours but I&rsquo;m really not hungry&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t eat\nbreakfast&rdquo; he said looking concerned </p><p>&ldquo;I had a banana&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t count, what&rsquo;s\ngoing on love?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Apparently I don&rsquo;t\ndeal well with jetlag&rdquo; </p><p>He nodded &ldquo;We can go\nhome and nap if you want?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Get your food first&rdquo;\nshe smiled. </p><p>If she was honest,\nshe was over the jetlag, it had been three weeks, but the constant travel was\ngetting to her and now that her and Harry were sharing a room, she was having\ntrouble sleeping, she wasn&rsquo;t used to having someone sleeping next to her and\nHarry snored louder than she thought humanly possible. She wasn&rsquo;t hungry\nbecause she was tired and she was tired because she needed her space, but she\ndidn&rsquo;t want to be away from Harry. </p><p>Mitch and Sarah had\nalready sat down in a shady spot under a tree and were quite content with each\nother. Harry looked at Anna and then at his two bandmates and back to Anna. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re happy over\nthere, let&rsquo;s go home and we&rsquo;ll order something in&rdquo; </p><p>*** </p><p>Anna had woken up\nfeeling wonderful this morning, but by the time 6pm rolled around she was\nfeeling ill again and she had no idea why. She slept like a baby last night and\nshe&rsquo;d even eaten breakfast, which isn&rsquo;t something she did when she was home,\nshe usually skipped straight to lunch but this morning Harry had insisted on\ncooking her breakfast and she had to admit he was a pretty good cook. &nbsp;</p><p>But it was 6:30 pm\nnow and she was sitting backstage at Madison Square Garden, her laptop open to\na blank document, sipping on a green tea, hoping that it would make her feel\nbetter, or at least inspire her to write something. Since being on tour with\nHarry her blog had taken a backseat, she had a lot to write about and things\nshe&rsquo;d love to share with her followers, but she couldn&rsquo;t because no one knew\nthere was anything going on with her and Harry. Of course there were the few\nfans that had their suspicions, but no one believed that they were actually\ndating, as far as his fandom was concerned, he was still with Camille and Anna\nwas happy to leave it at that for a little while longer but that did make it\nhard for her to write blog posts about her travels. She didn&rsquo;t doubt that those\nwith suspicions would compare her itinerary to Harry&rsquo;s and realise that it was\nexactly the same. </p><p>&ldquo;Clarrrre&rdquo; Anna\nmoaned as Clare sat down next to her </p><p>&ldquo;Annnnna&rdquo; she\nmimicked Anna&rsquo;s tone and rested her head on the table. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have\nanything to write about!&rdquo; </p><p>Clare sat up and\nlooked around the room &ldquo;Ping Pong,&rdquo; she laughed and &nbsp;pointed at the rather\nintense ping pong competition that Harry had organised. </p><p>Anna thought for a\nminute, &ldquo;I think too many Harry fans know about the ping pong thing&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Clare said.\n&ldquo;They also think he was dating Camille&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I like that it&rsquo;s our\nsecret for now,&rdquo; she admitted. </p><p>&ldquo;He really likes you\nAnna&rdquo; Clare said, lowering her voice so that no one could hear them &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only\nknown him for two years, but I&rsquo;ve never seen him act the way he does around\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it\nstrange that he had Camille on the first half of the tour and now I&rsquo;m here?&rdquo;\nThis was something that Anna hadn&rsquo;t really been able to let go of, as much as\nshe liked Harry, she couldn&rsquo;t help but see Ronnie&rsquo;s point, she was just a tour\nbuddy, once it all ends and he can go back to his normal life Anna would be\nforgotten about. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much\nabout what happened between them&rdquo; Clare admitted &ldquo;but I know that for most of\nthe European leg, he did whatever he could to avoid being alone with her and\nafter that she disappeared.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;He told me it was\nall sex&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. I don&rsquo;t\nthink it&rsquo;s weird that you&rsquo;re here now An, I think he likes you enough to try\nand make it work, but he had the next few months of his life already set out\nfor him and the only way he could make it work with you is to have you here&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You might be right&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be\ninvasive or anything, but have you two had sex yet?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Anna blushed\n&ldquo;there&rsquo;s been a few times when it could have happened but we both made excuses&rdquo;\n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good&rdquo; Clare\nnodded &ldquo;means there&rsquo;s more to the relationship, but don&rsquo;t let it go to long&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly my\nfault, I keep chickening out&rdquo; as close as she&rsquo;d gotten to Clare over the last\nfew weeks, this was the first time they&rsquo;d spoken about anything like this and\nshe felt a little weird about it considering Harry was technically Clare&rsquo;s\nboss. </p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she didn&rsquo;t\nseem phased by the conversation. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been almost a\nyear&rdquo; Anna hid her face in her hands &ldquo;what if they&rsquo;ve changed it?&rdquo;</p><p>Clare giggled and put\nher hand on Anna&rsquo;s back, &ldquo;I assure you, it hasn&rsquo;t changed&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oi Elliot&rdquo;, Harry\ncalled across the room bringing their conversation to an end as Anna turned\naround to face him. </p><p>&ldquo;Oi Styles&rdquo; Anna\ncalled back, a grin on her face </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up love,&rdquo; he\ntwisted the ping pong bat in his hand and picked up the other one,holding it\nout to her</p><p>She shut her laptop\nand stood up, making her way towards him. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve\nplayed ping pong since I was about 10,&rdquo; she said taking the bat off him </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be gentle,&rdquo; he\nwinked at her and Clare started giggling from the sidelines &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gotten into\nher?&rdquo; he asked </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, we were just\nhaving a chat&rdquo;, Anna smiled &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s game on Styles.&rdquo; </p><p>Harry had his game\nface on, and so did Anna, even though she&rsquo;s avoided ping pong at all costs\nsince the beginning of the tour. Sports had never been her thing and she didn&rsquo;t\nwant to embarrass herself in front of him but today was different. She knew how\nnervous he was about this show and she thought that maybe this would keep him\ndistracted before he had to go on stage. </p><p>&ldquo;You call that a\ntrick shot Styles?&rdquo; Anna said as she hit the ball back to him </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;, he smirked &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nbeing gentle&rdquo; and with that he used all the power in his right hand to hit the\nball back to Anna. She hadn&rsquo;t been expecting it to be going so fast so when she\nswung her arm, she missed, the little orange ball sped right past her and Harry\nburst out laughing. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened to\nbeing gentle?&rdquo; she pouted as she turned around to fetch the ball. </p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m not going\nto just let you win love&rdquo; he shrugged &ldquo;so are we going to play properly? Or are\nyou forfeiting now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give up that\neasily&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he\nlaughed &ldquo;I seem to remember you giving up on uni pretty easily&rdquo; </p><p>Anna gritted her\nteeth through a giggle &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s on Styles&rdquo; </p><p>She threw the ball up\nto serve but missed on the swing. Harry raised his eyebrows and held back a\nlaugh but he didn&rsquo;t say anything, he simply put his bat down and walked around\nthe table so that he was standing behind Anna. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me show you&rdquo; he\nwrapped his arms around her and adjusted her hands on the paddle. &ldquo;Line the\nball up with your paddle&rdquo; he said,picking the ball up and placing it directly\non the paddle &ldquo;and then when you throw it up, don&rsquo;t take your eyes off it, the\nrest will just happen&rdquo; &nbsp;He took a step back and watched as Anna did what\nhe told her. It worked and Anna hit the ball across the room. </p><p>&ldquo;Ayy&rdquo; he smiled\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it love. Now&rdquo; he picked up his own paddle again &ldquo;It&rsquo;s game on&rdquo; </p><p>He picked the ball up\nagain and threw it back to her so that she could serve it. </p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t going\neasy on her, his competitive side was definitely shining as the crew all\ngathered around to watch. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on Anna,&rdquo; Clare\ncalled when the score was even. &ldquo;Finish him off!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo;\nHarry smirked and hit the ball to Anna&rsquo;s left, so hard that she missed it and\nit fell to the floor. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he shrugged</p><p>&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not&rdquo; she\nmoved around to his side of the table and wrapped her arms around him. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&rdquo; he\nplaced a kiss onto her forehead &ldquo;I have to go get ready now, you coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; she nodded\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a nap on that couch while you do your thing&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You feeling ok?&rdquo; he\nasked taking her hand and heading towards the dressing rooms </p><p>&ldquo;Not wonderful, but\nI&rsquo;m ok&rdquo; </p><p>*** </p><p>Madison Square\nGarden, night two. Anna was standing in the crew area near the b-stage, with\nAnne right next to her and they were both emotional. Anne had been crying\npretty much all night and Anna couldn&rsquo;t help but smile up at Harry on the\nstage. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do an\nextra one for you tonight&rdquo; Harry said into the mic and the crowd went wild.\nAnna knew exactly what was coming, one of her favourites parts about this tour\nwas watching the soundcheck every night. It reminded her of the night they met\nand the way that he&rsquo;d smile at her from up there still gave her butterflies,\nand she guessed that was a good thing. </p><p>&ldquo;This was the first\nsong he knew all the words to&rdquo; Anne smiled, placing her hand over her heart as\nhe began singing Shania Twain&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Still the One</i>&rsquo; &ldquo;and now look at him&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Looks like he made\nit Anne,&rdquo; Anna wrapped her arm around Anne&rsquo;s shoulder and they both started\nswaying along to the music. As she watched Harry up on the stage she couldn&rsquo;t\nhelp but picture him as a three or four year old sitting in the back of his\nmum&rsquo;s car mumbling along to the song, making up his own phrases for the ones\nthat he couldn&rsquo;t quite make out or understand and she felt an enormous sense of\npride. She&rsquo;d only known him for a few months, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but see how\nfar he&rsquo;d come, from being that little boy that sang along to his mum&rsquo;s\nfavourite songs in the back of the car, to standing on stage at Madison Square\nGarden singing not only the entirety of his album but also the songs that got\nhim there to a sold out room with just about every person singing those lyrics\nback. </p><p>Harry wasn&rsquo;t looking\nout into the crowd much but when he did, he was looking for Anna, but he\ncouldn&rsquo;t see her because of the stage lights. </p><p><i>Ain&rsquo;t\nnothin&rsquo; better</i></p><p><i>We\nbeat the odds together</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;m\nglad we didn&rsquo;t listen</i></p><p><i>Look\nat what we would be missin</i>&rsquo;</p><p>Anna\nstewed on those lyrics for a second. She still didn&rsquo;t really know what Harry\nwas to her, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be anything if she listened to Ronnie. Imagine if\nshe did, she would be sleeping alone in her London flat, without ever having\nexperienced Harry on tour and that wasn&rsquo;t something she wanted to think about. &nbsp;In some ways, Anna was glad that\nit took as long as it did for their paths to cross, but it baffled her that it\ndidn&rsquo;t happen before then. Her and Harry grew up parallel to each other, in\nopposite towns, doing the same things with their time but Anna spent all her\ntime with Ronnie and maybe she shouldn&rsquo;t have. </p><p>The\nfinal notes of the song echoed around the arena and Anne turned and hugged Anna.\n</p><p>&ldquo;Thank\nyou dear,&rdquo; she said trying to choke back tears &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a long time since\nI&rsquo;ve seen him this happy&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s\nall him Anne&rdquo; Anna really didn&rsquo;t think that Anne should be thanking her, she\nhadn&rsquo;t really done anything. </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;\nshe wiped a tear away &ldquo;no love, you&rsquo;ve helped.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well\nI&rsquo;m having the best time being on tour with him&rdquo; Anna smiled, and it was true,\nthese last few weeks had been the most fun she&rsquo;d had in years. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re\na wonderful girl Anna, your mum must be so proud&rdquo; </p><p>Anna\nsmiled at Anne but she didn&rsquo;t say anything, because if she was honest, she\ndidn&rsquo;t know if her mum was proud of &nbsp;her, she was supportive as hell and\nallowed her to do what she thought was best, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure that proud was\nan emotion her mother felt towards her. </p><p>&ldquo;We\nshould go backstage now dear&rdquo; Anne put her hand on Anna&rsquo;s shoulder while Harry\nintroduced Kiwi, pulling her away from her thoughts. They ducked out of the\nbooth and snuck backstage together while the crowd was distracted enough not to\nnotice and as the made their way through the hallways it dawned on Anna that\nshe hadn&rsquo;t checked her phone all day, she couldn&rsquo;t even remember where she put\nit but she guessed that it was somewhere in Harry&rsquo;s dressing room. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngoing to wait near the stage dear, to meet him when he comes off&rdquo; Anne said,\nturning down the hallway that lead to the stage area. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to\nfind my phone and I&rsquo;ll meet you there&rdquo; Anna turned on her heel and opened the\ndoor to Harry&rsquo;s dressing room. </p><p>Her phone was sitting\non the table buzzing like crazy, which was odd because it was the early hours\nof the morning in the UK and she didn&rsquo;t have anyone in the US that would be\ntrying to contact her. She picked it up and saw thousands of twitter\nnotifications and furrowed her brow as she unlocked her phone. No one ever\ntweeted her, she got the occasional mention from one of her blogger friends,\nbut other than that it was pretty quiet, her followers mostly interacted on\ninstagram or directly on her blog. </p><p>&ldquo;No. Fuck&rdquo; she\nbreathed when she saw what it was. Pictures of her and Harry, snuggled up in\nCentral Park. This is exactly what she was trying to avoid, it would get her\nattention for all of the wrong reasons and the last thing she wanted was for\nHarry&rsquo;s fans to get the wrong idea about her. Her name was trending at #3 and\nshe&rsquo;d gained thousands of new followers across all of her social media but she\nrefused to check the comments, she didn&rsquo;t want to know what people were saying\nabout her. </p><p>Her head was\nspinning, she felt ill again and she had to find Harry. She pushed the door\nopen and the hallway was crowded again which she knew meant the show was over\nand she maneuvered herself through the crew members without looking up. </p><p>&ldquo;Whoa&rdquo; an unfamiliar\nvoice sounded and someone grabbed her shoulder &ldquo;slow down, you&rsquo;re going to run\ninto someone&rdquo; </p><p>Anna looked up to see\nCamille Rowe standing in front of her, holding onto her shoulder, a smile\nspread across her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met you,\nare you new to the crew?&rdquo; she said, her tone overly sweet</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Anna said bluntly\n&ldquo;Harry and I are dating.&rdquo; This wasn&rsquo;t entirely true, they&rsquo;d been on a few\ndates, but nothing was official yet</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo; Camille seemed\nshocked by this and that made Anna wonder if Harry had really broken up with\nher like he said he did on their first date. Before she had a chance to say\nanything more though, Jeff stepped past them on his way to see Harry and Anna\npulled him aside. </p><p>&ldquo;Jeffy&rdquo; she said and\nCamille scoffed at the nickname. &ldquo;Have you seen this?&rdquo; </p><p>Anna handed him her\nphone and his face fell the minute he saw the pictures. </p><p>&ldquo;Does H know?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; Anna shook her\nhead &ldquo;they must have come out while he was on stage&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to tell\nhim or should I?&rdquo; he handed her the phone back </p><p>&ldquo;Together?&rdquo; Anna\nsmiled hopefully at him. </p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then&rdquo; he\nsmiled and then pointed to Camille &ldquo;How did you get back here?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The door&rdquo; she said\nsarcastically. </p><p>&ldquo;Joe&rdquo; Jeff said the\nthe security guard that was standing within ear shot &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not on the list\nanymore&rdquo; </p></p>",

It\u2019s been 20 minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. 20 minutes since you pulled some bullshit on me as ridiculous and energy killing as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a party, Y/N. A party.\u201d </p><p>You huff. That\u2019s the point. A party. Something you didn\u2019t \u00a0feel like engaging in \u2014 3 hours away. </p><p>\u201cAnd from your attitude, you need a good fucking anyway. Hopefully you\u2019ll find one.\u201d Marlee\u2019s flip flops clack against her heels as she walks over to a very uninterested Y/N, uninterested in her bland attitude. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon lovely,\u201d She persuades. \u201cNo class for three days. Why not take advantage of that?\u201d M\u2019s legs sandwich themselves in between her best friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJust tired, and parties aren\u2019t fun anymore; just completely exhausting with hell hangovers.\u201d Your eyes are glued to your cell phone, answering Marlee between gaps of breath, as if you don\u2019t care. </p><p>You don\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only if you let yourself get pissy drunk.\u201d</p><p>You look up, eyes tired, brain hurting. \u201cStop being an ass, you understand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the grump!\u201d Marlee argues. \u201cGet up,\u201d She lightly slaps her thigh. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have fun, we\u2019re gonna let loose \u2014 in a huge mansion filled the brim with delicious sushi and expensive alcohol \u2014 we\u2019re not letting you turn this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting out of this, there\u2019s no point in trying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You grunts lowly. Marlee shrugs, it\u2019s true. Trotting around the corner into the hallway leading to your small bedroom, you go to pack the rest of belongings for the extended stay. </p><p>M stays at the couch, clapping and all smiles. \u201cPack something sexy, and the rest of your makeup!\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t get me a cheese danish! My dress is skin tight, and I\u2019ll be bloated!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, eat the food.\u201d Sitting down you place the paper bag into Marlee\u2019s lap, sitting the iced coffee\u2019s in the cup holders. Your hands are wet, a feeling you hate. The surface of both of the plastic cups, reacted to their concoctions, making them wet. You plop in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I love you,\u201d Marlee sing-songed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so.\u201d You start. \u201cWhos party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cousin Rafe\u2019s. He\u2019s rich, therefore kicks it with richies. He has a mansion up in The Hills. It\u2019s gonna be fun. Trust me.\u201d Marlee starts her small car and drives off, the slight sound of music playing from the Starbuck\u2019s speaker outside its building diminishing. It\u2019s a nice day, not too hot to the point where you need to activate the air in the little Toyota, but not too cold where you can\u2019t let the windows down either. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brung up a Rafe before,\u201d You pull out your little bag of necessities for a trip extended like so. There\u2019s nothing too special it\u2019s holding, just a bottle of nail polish, some makeup wipes, and a portable charger. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my fave cousin. Aged 24 so not too much of a gap between us. I haven\u2019t seen him in forever, I miss him muchly.\u201d Marlee says. You show the bottle to the black nail polish, before twisting it open. Using a folder from Marlee\u2019s glove compartment, you begin carefully painted your nails, efficiently coating layers. </p><p>Your nostrils flare, \u201cI miss my family too\u2026\u201d Biting your lip quite intensely, you re- think the two words that contemplating your brain, not excited for it to ruin the mood, because it will. Seeing his name notificate your phone earlier was the worst case scenario. </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve the world I gave him\u2026\u201d You say. Marlee merges onto the highway, glancing quickly at you, seeing you\u2019ve stopped painting to leant back against the leather of the chair. </p><p>\u201cUh. What? Elaborate, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrock texted.\u201d Silence. </p><p>\u201cLovely\u2026\u201d Marlee consoled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, it\u2019s just\u2026 it threw me off. That\u2019s why I was being a bitch \u2014 I know we hate bitches. Sorry about that.\u201d You breathe with ease, chuckling lightly. Marlee\u2019s relieved Brock doesn\u2019t scare you like he use to, since you have the audacity to crack jokes and all, but her tongue is still fairly dry. Brock wasn\u2019t good to you; you both aren\u2019t blind to that fact. </p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. What did he say?\u201d Marlee\u2019s time was urgent as she gripped the steering wheel causing her knuckles to whiten. The hot pink polish on her nails grew more prominent because of it. </p><p>You turned. \u201cHe missed me.\u201d \u00a0The response was simple and short, but complete. \u201cAnd I panicked, so I ignored him. And that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He doesn\u2019t deserve you. Just like you said \u2014 he didn\u2019t deserve the world you gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t. I\u2019m excited for the party now, though,\u201d</p><p>You say, blowing on your thumb. \u201cAnd maybe that fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBIIIITCH!\u201d Marlee nudges you. \u201cMaybe you can find a hot CEO or something.\u201d The girls laugh. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that rich?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cYes. Rafe is THAT rich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s gonna try to get with you the minute he sees you, he\u2019s always been that way. I won\u2019t let him though, so, don\u2019t mind some cringey pickup lines if he\u2019s bold to try them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You abides, nodding. </p><p>\u2022</p><p>The mansion is definitely a mansion. Using the code Rafe texted Marlee with just 30 more minutes to go of the drive, the girls emerged in the subdivision, with awe written across their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat do these people do?\u201d You had asked, completely flabbergasted. Marlee giggled, she shoulders bouncing with every breath released. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! Because I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in college right now if I can\u2019t have THIS when I get out.\u201d You wail your arms around, referring to the lavish cars in people\u2019s driveways, the fresh, plush grass paving their yards. It\u2019s almost like you can smell the wealth lingering in the air. </p><p>\u201cI think this is the one,\u201d Marlee mutters. She activates the turning signal, turning into one of the nicest homes on the block. Several trucks whether it be a G Wagon, a Jeep, or Range Rover chill to the side of the driveway, a parking lot type thing going on. They\u2019re all elaborate colors like lime green or a bright orange, and each license plate reads \u2018Styles\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s hotter in the Hidden Hills, most definitely. Your sweatshirt had to come off as soon as you guys hit the Calabasas welcoming sign. And from what it seems, it\u2019s only going to get hotter.</p><p>Taking a wild guess you\u2019re sure this is Rafe, as Marlee jumps out of the car to run into the arms of the man walking outside. His skill is tan, and his body is lean. He looks intimidating, but that\u2019s to be expected with wealth trailing behind you. </p><p>\u201cHey, how are you?\u201d He says, accepting Marlee\u2019s hug. He seems nice, you think. Standing awkwardly a few feet away from the reunited family members, you giving them all the time they need to rekindle, patiently waiting as you hug your midsection.</p><p>\u201cThis is my best friend, Y/N.\u201d Marlee gestures toward Rafe, waving her over.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s nice to meet you!\u201d You reaches your hand out, and Rafe gives a closed mouth smile, accepting it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I hope both of you girls have a lot of fun tonight \u2014 though I\u2019d just invite ya, having not seen ya in awhile.\u201d Rafe sideyes you, his tongue peeking out of his lip slightly. Oh, fuck.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t my house,\u201d He falters. Oh.</p><p>\u201cBut, if you go upstairs, and make your way down the hallway and around the corner to the left, you can choose any of those rooms to claim for the night. The party starts at 9, and doesn\u2019t end until people start leaving which isn\u2019t until like 3am. I\u2019ll be out back by the pool, have fun.\u201d And with that, he starts for the perimeter of the house, going out back. Okay.</p><p>\u2022</p><p>\u201cBiiitch we need to cut it out!\u201d Marlee\u2019s whispers, but doesn\u2019t as she giggles getting too much.</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to!\u201d You exclaim, looking around your chosen room. You guys have ran around every inch and of the home you could find on the main and second floor, but not opening doors for the sake of the home owner. The ones that were open though, you didn\u2019t mind taking a peek in. In all, you came across a pool room, a fitness room, an arcade, and a theater along with some bland rooms that simply had nothing occupying them \u2014maybe a chair, or neglected desk. Eventually, ya\u2019ll did follow Rafes directions in actually claiming a bedroom. Like little giddy girls squealing over Zach Efron at a 6th grade sleepover, you freaked about this too, cherishing the \u2018luxury life\u2019 \u2014 and just having a little fun, for a tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, open the makeup cases and put them on the counter.\u201d Marlee said. You did so, turning on the lights to the connected bathroom. After, grabbing you and M\u2019s bags, you found the closet to sit the clothes for the time being in. </p><p>Suits.</p><p>Lots of suits.</p><p>From purple, to pink, from navy blue, to red. From sparkles to plaid, from suede, to velvet.</p><p>So much color - so much texture. So many to choose from. Being impulsive, like you are you shut the door. That closet was off limits in your mind, not welcomed for newcomers. Each and every one of those suits looked so expensive \u2014 no doubt they could fund the average family for 6 months.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Marlee\u2019s eyes are questioning as she sits up right in on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d You blurt. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Let\u2019s ugh, let\u2019s do your hair.\u201d You turn away from M for a moment, scolding yourself with a roll of your eye. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marlee shrugs hopping off of the bed. She thought absolutely nothing of anything, and that\u2019s what you loved about your friend most \u2014 she wasn\u2019t a poker, nor a proder for information.</p><p>The camera flashed, and the girls looked back at the photo.</p><p>\u201cWe look HELLA cute!\u201d You exclaim, instantly saving the photo before adding it to your story. You wore a black two piece outfit, the shirt cropped, along with the skirt, short and tight. The heels you decided on were a nice velvet tan, straps that accompanying your calves as they tied up your legs. Marlee\u2019s dress was a pretty blue color, with some simple black heels.</p><p>\u201cI cannot seem to find&hellip;\u201d Marlee mumbled as she walked away. She was obviously talking to herself, so you went and applied another coat of sheer lipgloss for good measure. As the smooth substance rounded your lips, Marlee perked. </p><p>\u201cDid you see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>You look to Marlee, and she hold a suit jacket in her hand. It was a maroon-ish color, jewel complementing the start of the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cPut it down!\u201d You \u00a0grabbed the jacket from her, finding the assumed the matching pants for it, and hanging it up again in the closet. \u201cDo you know how much these probably are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no shit. It\u2019s says Gucci on the inside.\u201d</p><p>You slapped her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch then, crazy!\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook how cool they are, though!\u201d Marlee boggled. She walks further into the closet, randomly grabbing another suit jacket. \u201cOooooohh this one\u2019s nice!\u201d She admires the clothing, twisting the hanger back and forth between her fingers to get a glimpse in all directions.</p><p>It was pretty gorgeous. It\u2019s a baby pink shade, and velvet textured. From what it looked like, it had woven frog designs, and crystal embroidery. It was so, so pretty. A fixed look was on your face, as you pouted your head hanging at a limp. </p><p>\u201cWear it.\u201d Marlee said \u2014 no. It wasn\u2019t a statement, let alone a question. More of a command.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?! No! I-it\u2019s not mine!\u201d Marlee drags your name out as you decline.</p><p>\u201cBro, this isn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s house. He probably rented it for the night of something, HE doesn\u2019t even know who this belongs\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that! The person could be at this party!\u201d</p><p>Marlee scoffs, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d It would look so good with your outfit! Just hold it!\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips, snatching the jacket from Marlee, taking a look. It was pretty, and you did like the idea of maybe rocking it, but it wasn\u2019t yours \u2014 you would never.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pure gem right there \u2014 try it on, at least,\u201d Marlee insists.</p><p>You grunt, before mumbling freely, enough for M to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re one for making bad decisions.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO ONE IS HERE BUT US, WOMEN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Gosh.\u201d Your dainty fingers drop the hanger from the jacket, slipping it on. Walking to the mirror in the bathroom with Marlee on your tracks, you feel up the jacket, the soft material lovely under the pads of your fingers.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019quite cute.\u201d Your friend nods with her arms crossed. You look at her wary through the reflection of the large mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wear it. You\u2019re not messy. You\u2019re not incapable. It\u2019s just a few hours.\u201d Staying silent, you look down at the tiled floor. \u201cHey.\u201d You perks your chin, a little hum omitting from the back of your dry throat. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get you a fuck.\u201d </p><p>Marlee bursts at the seams, laughing hysterically at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fuh-nny.\u201d Y/N snickers in between breathes, looking at the jacket once more.</p><p> \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear it?\u201d Marlee asks. She\u2019s like a hyper child, her mood so happy for you to wear a piece of clothing. </p><p>\u201cYes, I guess. It\u2019s really pretty&hellip; but I\u2019m also trusting your word with all my fate that this guy isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh talk about embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>Marlee checks her phone, \u201cIt\u2019s ten. Let\u2019s head down.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>You hated yourself for not bringing Advil.</p><p>With the loud music, crazed screaming matches between people, and the alcoholic beverages, you were done for fairly quickly. It wasn\u2019t necessary to go back upstairs though, as people were everywhere, getting into everything. </p><p>Marlee and you chilled poolside, the water forming an iridescent glow. Twilight hours were long gone, as the sun was setting when y\u2019all first arrived. The only thing providing light now we\u2019re lanterns which were nice and dimmed, making everything pretty with a glow. </p><p>You\u2019d met a few people, one of them being a gal named Evie. She was purple haired, her eyes being a nice blue shade. She\u2019s very \u2018out there\u2019, making it fun to talk and dance with her \u2014 that was until she announced she was going to get more alcohol and never came back. It wasn\u2019t too surprising as her and another guest Nelly hit if off nice. The two women were most definitely somewhere hooking up, but you just hoped they\u2019d come down again after \u2014 they were beyond friendly, and really fun to be around. </p><p>\u201cI still really want those Jell-O shots regardless,\u201d Marlee says, a cocktail in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI can go get them, just stay here so I won\u2019t lose ya.\u201d She nods, pulling out her phone, probably about to capture another moment of this party for social media, as her name is Marlee. You will admit, the party is fun, and nicely decorated with bearable music playing through the speakers. Everyone was nice, and you hadn\u2019t seen anything too manic yet; more people were flooding in though, meaning more food and alcohol was too, and all types of personalities so you never know. The only bothering thing was the ache in your temples, clouding your brain with worried thought more than the drinks. You weren\u2019t wasted, not even a little bit tipsy, but you wouldn\u2019t mad if you got there. </p><p>A Tiki Bar was down farther down the lawn, causing you to have to walk on the plush grass. Plush or not, grass is grass, and you weren\u2019t ready for grass stains on your heels. They were new, (and expensive) and keeping them nice wasn\u2019t mandatory. But you shook off the frustration, and throbbing headache for the sake of having fun. </p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d A long haired blondie that looked as if he surfed the Malibu waves for a living asked. You giggled a bit, as he shimmied with a bright smile, eyebrows prying for an answer. </p><p>You has to raise your voice over the music, \u201cUgh, I just need some Jell-O shots!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDank!\u201d He said going to the mini fridge. Yeah, definitely a surfer, if not just an illiterate goof. </p><p>\u201cDo you reckon some plain vodka shots instead? We\u2019re all out.\u201d He replies. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re nasty plain. I\u2019ll just go inside and find some, thanks, though!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee ya later! Aye, that jacket\u2019s pretty gnarly by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You say more dumbfounded than anything. You can\u2019t resist. \u201cHey, do you surf?\u201d </p><p>His face lit up. \u201cI sure dooooo!\u201d He gushes, carrying the vowel. You giggle \u2014 had to know. </p><p>It was refreshing talking to a dude that just wanted to talk, and wasn\u2019t desperate for your vagina. Honestly, you did want a fuck to relieve stress and sexual tension, but not with a dude that was basically belting with horny hormones. You reminded yourself this wasn\u2019t the college party you were use to, didn\u2019t know everyone. That fuck that was craved was unfortunately out the window. Maybe next time. </p><p>The air wasn\u2019t cool anymore inside the house, as it was taken over by several partiers; more in here than outside. It was a stuffy atmosphere. Dancing caused sweat, and with being in such proximity of a fellow person, it can accommodate a lot of it. Closing the slide door, you maneuvered around the dancing bodies and make out sessions, trying to recall where the kitchen was. </p><p><i>Right? Yeah, go right. </i></p><p><i>Um, down this hall, then left. </i></p><p><i>Fuck no, not left! Dammit, Y/N.</i></p><p><i>Okay, right.</i></p><p><i>NOW left. </i></p><p><i>Okay okay, here we are.</i></p><p>The kitchens fairly empty and clean but to be honest, everything is on this side of the house. All of the sitting areas look pristine and untouched just like they were before. </p><p><i>What if they have Advil somewhere in here? </i></p><p>You can keep Advil in the kitchen\u2026 right? You don\u2019t know. You at least needed some ice, badly, to numb the pounding of your head for 5 minutes before going back out.</p><p>First you open the fridge for good measure, and what do you know, Jell-O shots and more cooled foods with-hold in it. </p><p><i>Now that ice. </i></p><p>Opening cabinets one by one, you look for some type of cups to dispense the ice cubes in. You do find the cups, some glasses reading \u2018Styles\u2019 monogrammed on the front.</p><p><i>What\u2019s with this dude? </i></p><p>\u201cNice jacket.\u201d </p><p>A raspy voice calls from behind you, and you freeze. Your heels turn to see a lean man leaning on the archway to the kitchen. His arms are crossed, an amused smirk playing his lips \u2014 the lips that are really pink. He\u2019s got on a some black jeans, and a casual yellow button up. All in all, he\u2019s cute. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d He reveals. </p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You laugh dryly, not understanding how in world you could be so stupid and follow through with Marlee\u2019s dumb idea. Now you\u2019re here, in the most awkward predicament. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not what it looks like \u2014 you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019cool, s\u2019cool,\u201d He says, \u201cI quite like you in it,\u201d He walks over, observing you closely in the jacket every which way, until he\u2019s in front of you, towering over. \u201cYou look hot. It fits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-thanks.\u201d You can only imagine how stupid you look right now, and you tell yourself to pull it together; it\u2019s failing miserably. A jittery mess you are, only thinking \u00a0about the vibrant color of his eyes, and the little dimple that peaks when he smiles.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhat were ya lookin\u2019 for?\u201d He gestures toward all of the open cabinets, chuckling a bit. </p><p>\u201cIce. Have a headache.\u201d She admits quietly. </p><p>\u201cNo medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t bother looking for any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you bothered rummaging through my closet?\u201d He\u2019s not serious, not mad, more so happy as he keeps chuckling.</p><p>\u201cRafe told us just to pick a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat room is off limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems after I already claimed it.\u201d</p><p>He flashes another starboy smile,his arms crossing nonchalantly. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, do you have Advil? Aspirin? Anything?\u201d You hopes to change the subject, tension getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He says. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He reaches out, his palm asking permission to take yours. You didn\u2019t know what was worse, the fact that you\u2019re blushing has gotten wayyy out of hand from his face, or the fact that you&rsquo;re still in his Gucci jacket he called you hot in. </p><p>Either way, you took his hand because why the fuck wouldn\u2019t you. </p><p>His stride is so quick she has to damn there run with him to keep up. He didn\u2019t seem to really care too much about the swarm of people, as they pass them no problem and make their way upstairs. It\u2019s darker in the hallway, and a toilet flushes from behind the bathroom door. There\u2019s some foams cups littered up and down the corridor, a random bottle of Hennessy lying upon the hardwood floors. </p><p>Your mouth waters in such way, admiring the random ink on him. You enjoy the spontaneous look of his tattoos, like how there\u2019s a locket chillin above the arrow, or a naked mermaid rounding his forearm; you\u2019re sure that\u2019s your favorite. </p><p>Wait. </p><p><i>What\u2019s his name? </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He opens the door to his bedroom, it being obvious with how big and dominant it is. You doesn\u2019t have to ask, it\u2019s his house they\u2019re in. The room has quite a plain look, but you doesn\u2019t see the harm. With white sheets rounding the King sized bed, and a fur rug centering the room, it\u2019s a nice look. </p><p>You like that, too. </p><p>\u201cHarry. Harry Styles. Yours?\u201d Their hands are detached now as he close the door and makes his way to the more illuminated crevice of his room, his bathroom. You tell him your name, and he nods. </p><p>Your eyebrows quirk as you wonder why this bathroom could literally fit your whole entire room in it, and then some. \u201cMakes since.\u201d You respond, still on the top of names. </p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Harry rummages through a drawer, prying little things out like neglected bobby pins and toothbrush protectors. </p><p>\u201cAnything you can put \u2018Styles\u2019 on, you do.\u201d Absentmindedly, you picks up his soap on the sink, smell it, and then lay it down again. </p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re observant.\u201d Harry stands from his crouching position, after finally finding some pain relievers. There\u2019s a small stack of disposable mouthwash cups and Harry fills one with water to hand to you. He can\u2019t help watching your every move as you toss both small pink tablets into your mouth and gulp down the water. He likes how you hold the cup, your little pinky sticking up as if it\u2019s tea. He also likes how you take notice of his observing and asks him what his problem is right after, too. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just really pretty, s\u2019all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u2026 again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI enjoy seeing you blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I enjoy compliments, so keep them coming.\u201d You joke. He shrugs, that\u2019s not challenging. </p><p>\u201cI like your attitude, you don\u2019t shy away from a comeback,\u201d You hum, and slowly nodding your head. \u201cI like how my Gucci fits you, and how the back hem of it sits right above your bum\u2026 gives the perfect view of it. S\u2019pretty nice.\u201d His slick tone mixed with his accent is heaven in a bottle. </p><p>You take a few steps closer to Harry, biting your lip. His eyes trail up and down your figure once, before completing the eye contact you share \u2014 it\u2019s like a flame is ignited.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019gonna make a move first, or do I have to?\u201d His teases, hands coming up in a surrender way, that dimple showing once again. </p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to ask me twice. </i></p><p>His are soft and cool against your warm ones, and the feeling sends shivers down your spine. His hands grip your hips, and soon, it\u2019s a hot make out session as your tongues say hello to one another, and tangle. </p><p>You\u2019re pulling his hair at the nape of his neck, it\u2019s soft between your fingertips - you enjoys the feeling, and even wonder if it\u2019s the appropriate time to ask him what products he uses; nevermind that. He slides his hands down to grip the curve of her bum, as you get more aggressive with his strands. You take the risk of biting his lip harshly, but to soothe the pain, you suck on it, one hand cradling his jawline. The kiss breaks with a pop sound, both of them catching their absent breathes. </p><p>His pupils are dilated. \u201cHere, or my penthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two houses?\u201d You question. To keep him in your proximity, you tug at his collar. </p><p>\u201cFour. Now which one?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s desperate; you\u2019re feeding off of it.</p><p>You think for a few, leaning your head against Harry\u2019s. He\u2019s fidgety, as his eyelids blink rapidly. The color surprises you everytime he opens them again. </p><p>\u201cTo save you a drive, cause I know you\u2019re about to burst,\u201d You look to his crotch, jeans tightened around his manhood. \u201cWe can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re toxic.\u201d He cradles your jaw, tongues tangling once more, and you relish in the moment because it\u2019s just so nice. His right hand reaches to switch the bathroom light off before tapping your plump bum, signaling to \u2018jump\u2019. Wrapping your legs around his waist, and he effortlessly walks over to the foot of his bed. The bedroom isn\u2019t as bright, as the two bedside lamps are only on. It\u2019s a more comfortable feeling for you \u2014 the perfect lighting for two bodies to explore one another\u2019s. Marlee is forgotten and so are those Jell-O shots.</p><p>Harry releases you to stand on feet, and you have been doing that for awhile, but for some reason it\u2019s more difficult now. Your legs feel like some Jell-O shots, dazed by the events that are occurring so quickly. </p><p>You&rsquo;re putty in his hands. </p><p>Harry goes to lock the door quickly. After he comes back to see a very giggly and eager you, connecting your lips once more. </p><p><i>God, she\u2019s cute</i>, He thinks. </p><p>With a few tugs, you break the buttons of his shirt from the seams, the little pebble shaped things falling to the floor. With an eager giggling you, and a horny Harold,</p><p>it combines into this moment of absolute chaos. His stomach tattoos are out of this world, who would\u2019ve \u00a0thought to get a butterfly in the middle of their midsection and it look so good? You were amazed, the details of every single one, so intricate, so pretty, and so attractive. </p><p>The left side of your neck is Harry\u2019s new blank canvas, as he nips where he wants. He takes to accountability to find your sweet spot as his rubs up and down your sides, his big hands exploring your closed torso. His wet kisses travel throughout, and you whimper when he finds your spot, that spot that makes you weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d He mutters. </p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d You say back.</p><p>There, in the crevice of your jawline by your ear, he suctions his lips, sucking to break the skin and hopefully in the end, have a purple and pink colored hickey. Your eyes roll back, and you grip what\u2019s left of Harry shirt for dear life. You feel how hard he\u2019s breathing, how much he\u2019s sucking, and it\u2019s phenomenal. These sensations are new again, as you got so caught up in college, unable to experience this sooner. Your mind is refreshed with the feelings and emotion you feel during this type of thing, your underwear dampening in the blink of an eye. </p><p>You take the time to pull his jacket off, carelessly tossing it behind you on the bed as Harry slips off his shirt completely. With raising your arms up, Harry gets the memo you want to be topless \u2014 what he doesn\u2019t know is in order to make this top look good, you couldn\u2019t wear a bra. He fumbles with the material, finally gripping to pulling it over you head. Your breasts spring free of any congestion and the look on Harry\u2019s face is platinum. He like a thirsty dog, looking at his owner desperately as they fill his water bowl. He attacks your sternum area, both hands fiddling with the perky nipples of yours. You bite your lip, the feeling of his wet lips everywhere other than your face unfamiliar, but incredible. </p><p>His tongue is warm, his lips are soft, and boy does he know how to use them. His lips wrap around one of your nipples, and a fatal whimper proceeds to fall from your mouth as you grip onto his shoulders. He detaches just for a second to lay you down on your back, it colliding with the soft mattress. Harry&rsquo;s body is in between your thighs as he still takes the time to assault your chest, and you don\u2019t mind. You desperately run your fingers through his hair as he switches nipples, a moan pervading from the back of your throat. He loves the feeling of you, the sound of you, everything \u2014 he can only take so much of your sweet and soft moans before he\u2019s fingering around your skirt to pull off. </p><p>You nod your head, lifting your hips slightly to help him remove the material. He\u2019s standing now, towering over you, sure he can now say he\u2019s laid eyes on a real life angel. You\u2019re beautiful. Your lips are plumper and a shade darker from 20 minutes ago, your hair sprawled out on the mattress rounding your head like a crown upon the silk sheets. </p><p>He comes close to you one more time, placing a smooch to your navel, forehead, nose, then lips. You look to possibly deepen the kiss, but it\u2019s obvious Harry\u2019s looking to taste more things \u2014 and not your tongue at the moment. He looks at you with reassurance to naked you completely, which you abide in with a small, \u2018Please.\u2019 H does \u00a0takes time to rid you of the restriction, the simple black thong discarded somewhere in the room. </p><p>With an agonizing pace that makes you want to run yourself into a brick wall, Harry slowly kneels down on his knees. His forearms hook both of your thighs in the process, pulling them over his toned shoulders. Your chest rises, frustrated of his teasing ways as he goes closer to your youth, huffing long, hot, breathes onto it. You guys hold eye contact for a few seconds as he does this, causing you to plead. </p><p>\u201cHa\u2014<i>oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>The sentence is left pathetically broken up, his warm tongue lapping up and down your pussy repeatedly. </p><p>\u201cWet as fuck,\u201d He baits.</p><p>He\u2019s anxious, you taste delicious over his tongue, he can\u2019t help a little grunt of pleasure. You take hold of his mops of curls, at this period still trying to hold in your moans. You\u2019re writhing though, a mess already as your breathing toughens and your hair becoming a bit more frizzy. Your left hand reaches for the Gucci jacket discarded earlier. You hold it close to your chest, the other hand guiding Harry\u2019s head where you want him most; your clit. </p><p>He does follow your liking, applying pressure to the aroused bud with his warm, wet tongue. Your taste is ambrosial, somethings he\u2019s never tasted before \u2014 maybe you\u2019re a combination of honey \u2014 maybe something of citrus \u2014 or just simply you. Voluntarily lifting your legs up higher, with thighs now facing toward the ceiling now, Harry encourages your movements gripping them to stay there. He laps your dripping flower a few more times, liking the pretty moan that erupts from her lips each time he does so. </p><p>\u201cPretty little thing you are. Could assume you tasted good, but not how you do \u2014 delicious.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is raspy and low. You can\u2019t bare to hold back anymore, letting a loud mom rip through you like a bulldozer, the exhilaration of activities encouraging the act. </p><p>He sees you biting onto the Gucci wear, trying to silence yourself, but he\u2019s not having it. He\u2019s craving that noise of yours, the sounds that harden his dick. He stretches his arm, grabbing the Gucci and throwing it behind him. </p><p>\u201cWanna hear you,\u201d He instructs. \u201c\u2018Specially for this.\u201d </p><p>He sinks two fingers in you, a gargled sound erupting from you, a large gasp coming right after. The sounds you make are intangible to control, but neither of you mind \u2014 Harry\u2019s living now, hearing your reaction to his pleasure. He speeds up, your moans speed up, he slows down, you do as well. You feel good better than you have in awhile, and you assume you\u2019re just getting started. He harshly sucks on your clit some more, pumping his digits in and out at a faster pace. Harry \u00a0feels his jeans restraining more than ever, your taste, your moans, and the pulling of his hair too much. He takes his fingers out, a sad whimper coming from the beaut in front of him. He takes one finger at a time, suckling the juices - your juices, off of them, groaning at the taste; it\u2019s more prominent. </p><p>He\u2019s gotta have you. </p><p>Now. </p><p>\u201cHelp me out, love.\u201d He groans as he fumbles with his jeans. You without hesitation sit up, taking over the task of unbuckling everything. A huge amount of tension is liberated from his prick, only his Calvin\u2019s covering it. You\u2019re ready for the thing, ready to cum already with him inside of you. You\u2019ve never desired anything more for awhile, as your life\u2019s been pretty routined lately. </p><p>\u201cI am on the pill, and I\u2019m clean.\u201d You blurt. You want Harry real and raw, and will be damned if a condom stands in the way of that. After all, you really are on the pill and clean of any infections or diseases - you can only imagine Harry\u2019s the same. </p><p>He nods frantically, pupils dilated, the exotic color of his eyes almost gone as only a little green rounds the black. Pulling down his briefs, Harry\u2019s penis slaps his stomach before balancing out. He\u2019s big and swollen, Harry hissing as he kneels down a bit, lining himself with you. He\u2019s sensitive, pre cum drooling out of his tips nastily while he pumps himself. Sitting up on your shoulders, you observe his motion is such way to make Harry think you\u2019re just a desperate as he is. With eyes wild, slightly bloodshot, piercing into his own. </p><p>\u201cLay back, doll.\u201d He orders. Doing so, you reach for his shoulders, wanting a sweet kiss before starting. He give you it, laying on top on you with a forearm by your head. <i>He\u2019s big,</i> you think - <i>but nothing I can\u2019t handle. </i></p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d His apprehension gets the best of him, and even though he knows you\u2019re okay, he can\u2019t help to ask. </p><p>\u201c\u2018M good Harry, I\u2019m good. Just take me,\u201d You plead. He nods, hair coming down over his face and you move it off his forehead, holding one hand there. </p><p>He takes no more stalling time, and slowly eases into you. The longful moan you let out is like angels singing. You don\u2019t necessarily remember the feeling of the last time you had sex, but you know for sure you didn\u2019t feel this full \u2014 you never have. </p><p>\u201cFuuuck - Harry, oh my god.\u201d You drag. You grip his bicep, beckoning him to start moving. </p><p>\u201cAta, girl \u2014 fuck, y-you\u2019re tight.\u201d Harry seizes biting his lip as he gradually picks up speed. You feel him in your tummy, and your wetness can be heard from a mile away as your skin slaps repeatedly. You\u2019re thriving, a mount of tingles already building up inside you. Harry\u2019s pubic hair rushes up and down your clit as he moves, increasing the pressure more. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you like that baby?\u201d You whine a \u2018yeah\u2019 the weakness in your voice heard as your focused on the way he thrusts, fast movements jolting your body. Harry\u2019s forehead has beads of sweat forming as you pull him down for a kiss. Your breath is hot against one another\u2019s, his tongue running over your bottom lip, asking for permission inside. With everything going on as it is, you\u2019re not ready when Harry takes it into his hands to deliver you a hard, deep thrust, causing you to squeal and break contact between mouths. </p><p>You grit at your teeth. \u201cFuck, Har, I need \u2014 I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d He cuts you off. His thrusting hasn\u2019t slowed at all, his breathe heavy as he can\u2019t control himself. You\u2019re so fucking tight, so fucking pretty underneath him. </p><p>\u201cRide you \u2014 I wanna ride you.\u201d You choke.</p><p>Harry wastes no time to turn you two over. He moves up some more on the bed, and you straddle above his hips immediately as you press one hand down on his chest, and use the other to aline yourself with his cock. With your eyes on each other, you sink down, and gasp omitting from both parties. Harry guides you \u00a0firmly with his hands on your hips, slamming you down harder than you ever could on your own. His eyes are focused on the way your breasts are bouncing as y\u2019all continue, you open handedly kneading them to put on a show.</p><p>\u201cNice and wet and tight for me, doll. Couldn\u2019t ask,\u201d He pauses do gulp, \u201cCouldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d He finishes. You can see the vein prominent in his neck, his abs flexing underneath you. You continuously bounce of harder with the help of him, the feeling of getting filled to the brim by his huge cock never expiring. </p><p>You can feel your orgasm creeping up on you, and Harry certainly does too, as he grunts here and there when you tighten around him.</p><p>\u201cH-harry, shit! Harry,\u201d You moan.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, baby. C\u2019mon, say it. Know you want to.\u201d You\u2019re sweating now, pulsing around his cock. You hands plop back on his chest, toes curling at the bubbling sensation growing. \u201cDon\u2019t do it until you tell me, kitten.\u201d He orders. </p><p><i>Fuck,</i> you think.<i> He knows. </i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna \u2014 Harry, I\u2019m gonna cum so hard.\u201d You admit through gasps of breath. Harry\u2019s thumb presses to your clit, rubbing harsh figure eights into the little bud causing you to mewl out loud. </p><p>He smacks your ass with his other hand, and that only coaches you to go faster. \u201cS\u2019that the case? You can cum, baby. Cum nice and hard on my cock.\u201d He coaxes, flicking your clit with his pointer finger. </p><p>That\u2019s your green light, and Harry only speeds up the process by planting his feet on the mattress and thrusting up into you; the bubble in your lower stomach is bursted completely, white blotches forming, prohibiting your eyesight. Not that it mattered as you closed your eyes, collapsing on top of Harry. His skin is sticky, and his hands are clammy as he grabs your ass, to give it a few more thrusts up his dick. You\u2019re riding out your orgasm this way, euphoria washing over you as you moan into his ear tiredly.</p><p>He turns to kiss your temple, your head hidden in the crook of his neck. Soon, he\u2019s cumming too, deep moans of pleasure sounding. You glide your hands up and down his chest, kissing him in random spots. </p><p>You both take the time to calm, maybe after five minutes of you running your nails up and down his scalp, and him tracing miscellaneous circles around your back, he breaks the silence. </p><p>\u201cYou good, baby?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You answer contently. \u201cNever been better.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Harry insists. He looks down at you smiling like a goof, you fluffing his hair. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true!\u201d You protest. \u201cHaven\u2019t has this much fun in awhile&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you enjoyed yourself. Can\u2019t wait to have ya like this again in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said this was gonna happen again?\u201d You joke, eyebrows quirking. He sighs. </p><p>With a swift motion, you\u2019re below him once again as he relaxes between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d He says. \u201cI like ya a lot, and you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d With a quick kiss to your lips, you bop his nose.</p><p>You sarcastically sigh, caressing his cheek, \u201cI suppose we can do this again\u2026\u201d He\u2019s kissing your sternum, pecking the cushion of your breasts. </p><p>\u201cGive it a round two?\u201d He asks, looking up at you. </p><p>\u201cAfter I find my friend.\u201d You say, your pointer finger analyzing you statement. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad friend!\u201d Harry laughs, never knowing in the first place you were here with another person. You laugh along with him, realizing you really are. You left her, for a good hour now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, she\u2019s not a pariah \u2014 meets new pals pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, my vagina\u2019s throbbing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my penis is pulsing, what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! I hear your voice,\u201d Marlee bangs on the door a few times, startling you and H. \u201cYou got that fuck!\u201d From the sound of it, she\u2019s utterly wasted, her words slurring. \u201cHip hip hurray!\u201d She&rsquo;s yells, banging on the door once more. </p><p>Harry\u2019s laughing, his face scrunched on your chest. \u201cI like her!\u201d </p><p><b>a/n: Soooo that was my first smut.

A party.\u201d </p><p>You huff. That\u2019s the point. A party.

Hopefully you\u2019ll find one.\u201d Marlee\u2019s flip flops clack against her heels as she walks over to a very uninterested Y/N, uninterested in her bland attitude. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon lovely,\u201d She persuades. \u201cNo class for three days. Why not take advantage of that?\u201d M\u2019s legs sandwich themselves in between her best friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJust tired, and parties aren\u2019t fun anymore; just completely exhausting with hell hangovers.\u201d Your eyes are glued to your cell phone, answering Marlee between gaps of breath, as if you don\u2019t care. </p><p>You don\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only if you let yourself get pissy drunk.\u201d</p><p>You look up, eyes tired, brain hurting. \u201cStop being an ass, you understand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the grump!\u201d Marlee argues. \u201cGet up,\u201d She lightly slaps her thigh. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have fun, we\u2019re gonna let loose \u2014 in a huge mansion filled the brim with delicious sushi and expensive alcohol \u2014 we\u2019re not letting you turn this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting out of this, there\u2019s no point in trying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You grunts lowly.

My dress is skin tight, and I\u2019ll be bloated!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, eat the food.\u201d Sitting down you place the paper bag into Marlee\u2019s lap, sitting the iced coffee\u2019s in the cup holders. Your hands are wet, a feeling you hate. The surface of both of the plastic cups, reacted to their concoctions, making them wet. You plop in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I love you,\u201d Marlee sing-songed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so.\u201d You start. \u201cWhos party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cousin Rafe\u2019s. He\u2019s rich, therefore kicks it with richies. He has a mansion up in The Hills. It\u2019s gonna be fun. Trust me.\u201d Marlee starts her small car and drives off, the slight sound of music playing from the Starbuck\u2019s speaker outside its building diminishing. It\u2019s a nice day, not too hot to the point where you need to activate the air in the little Toyota, but not too cold where you can\u2019t let the windows down either. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brung up a Rafe before,\u201d You pull out your little bag of necessities for a trip extended like so. There\u2019s nothing too special it\u2019s holding, just a bottle of nail polish, some makeup wipes, and a portable charger. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my fave cousin. Aged 24 so not too much of a gap between us. I haven\u2019t seen him in forever, I miss him muchly.\u201d Marlee says. You show the bottle to the black nail polish, before twisting it open. Using a folder from Marlee\u2019s glove compartment, you begin carefully painted your nails, efficiently coating layers. </p><p>Your nostrils flare, \u201cI miss my family too\u2026\u201d Biting your lip quite intensely, you re- think the two words that contemplating your brain, not excited for it to ruin the mood, because it will. Seeing his name notificate your phone earlier was the worst case scenario. </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve the world I gave him\u2026\u201d You say. Marlee merges onto the highway, glancing quickly at you, seeing you\u2019ve stopped painting to leant back against the leather of the chair. </p><p>\u201cUh. What? Elaborate, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrock texted.\u201d Silence. </p><p>\u201cLovely\u2026\u201d Marlee consoled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, it\u2019s just\u2026 it threw me off. That\u2019s why I was being a bitch \u2014 I know we hate bitches. Sorry about that.\u201d You breathe with ease, chuckling lightly. Marlee\u2019s relieved Brock doesn\u2019t scare you like he use to, since you have the audacity to crack jokes and all, but her tongue is still fairly dry. Brock wasn\u2019t good to you; you both aren\u2019t blind to that fact. </p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. What did he say?\u201d Marlee\u2019s time was urgent as she gripped the steering wheel causing her knuckles to whiten. The hot pink polish on her nails grew more prominent because of it. </p><p>You turned. \u201cHe missed me.\u201d \u00a0The response was simple and short, but complete. \u201cAnd I panicked, so I ignored him. And that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He doesn\u2019t deserve you. Just like you said \u2014 he didn\u2019t deserve the world you gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t. I\u2019m excited for the party now, though,\u201d</p><p>You say, blowing on your thumb. \u201cAnd maybe that fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBIIIITCH!\u201d Marlee nudges you. \u201cMaybe you can find a hot CEO or something.\u201d The girls laugh. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that rich?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cYes. Rafe is THAT rich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s gonna try to get with you the minute he sees you, he\u2019s always been that way. I won\u2019t let him though, so, don\u2019t mind some cringey pickup lines if he\u2019s bold to try them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You abides, nodding. </p><p>\u2022</p><p>The mansion is definitely a mansion. Using the code Rafe texted Marlee with just 30 more minutes to go of the drive, the girls emerged in the subdivision, with awe written across their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat do these people do?\u201d You had asked, completely flabbergasted. Marlee giggled, she shoulders bouncing with every breath released. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! Because I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in college right now if I can\u2019t have THIS when I get out.\u201d You wail your arms around, referring to the lavish cars in people\u2019s driveways, the fresh, plush grass paving their yards. It\u2019s almost like you can smell the wealth lingering in the air. </p><p>\u201cI think this is the one,\u201d Marlee mutters. She activates the turning signal, turning into one of the nicest homes on the block. Several trucks whether it be a G Wagon, a Jeep, or Range Rover chill to the side of the driveway, a parking lot type thing going on. They\u2019re all elaborate colors like lime green or a bright orange, and each license plate reads \u2018Styles\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s hotter in the Hidden Hills, most definitely. Your sweatshirt had to come off as soon as you guys hit the Calabasas welcoming sign. And from what it seems, it\u2019s only going to get hotter.</p><p>Taking a wild guess you\u2019re sure this is Rafe, as Marlee jumps out of the car to run into the arms of the man walking outside. His skill is tan, and his body is lean. He looks intimidating, but that\u2019s to be expected with wealth trailing behind you. </p><p>\u201cHey, how are you?\u201d He says, accepting Marlee\u2019s hug. He seems nice, you think. Standing awkwardly a few feet away from the reunited family members, you giving them all the time they need to rekindle, patiently waiting as you hug your midsection.</p><p>\u201cThis is my best friend, Y/N.\u201d Marlee gestures toward Rafe, waving her over.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s nice to meet you!\u201d You reaches your hand out, and Rafe gives a closed mouth smile, accepting it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I hope both of you girls have a lot of fun tonight \u2014 though I\u2019d just invite ya, having not seen ya in awhile.\u201d Rafe sideyes you, his tongue peeking out of his lip slightly. Oh, fuck.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t my house,\u201d He falters. Oh.</p><p>\u201cBut, if you go upstairs, and make your way down the hallway and around the corner to the left, you can choose any of those rooms to claim for the night. The party starts at 9, and doesn\u2019t end until people start leaving which isn\u2019t until like 3am. I\u2019ll be out back by the pool, have fun.\u201d And with that, he starts for the perimeter of the house, going out back. Okay.</p><p>\u2022</p><p>\u201cBiiitch we need to cut it out!\u201d Marlee\u2019s whispers, but doesn\u2019t as she giggles getting too much.</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to!\u201d You exclaim, looking around your chosen room. You guys have ran around every inch and of the home you could find on the main and second floor, but not opening doors for the sake of the home owner. The ones that were open though, you didn\u2019t mind taking a peek in. In all, you came across a pool room, a fitness room, an arcade, and a theater along with some bland rooms that simply had nothing occupying them \u2014maybe a chair, or neglected desk. Eventually, ya\u2019ll did follow Rafes directions in actually claiming a bedroom. Like little giddy girls squealing over Zach Efron at a 6th grade sleepover, you freaked about this too, cherishing the \u2018luxury life\u2019 \u2014 and just having a little fun, for a tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, open the makeup cases and put them on the counter.\u201d Marlee said. You did so, turning on the lights to the connected bathroom. After, grabbing you and M\u2019s bags, you found the closet to sit the clothes for the time being in. </p><p>Suits.</p><p>Lots of suits.</p><p>From purple, to pink, from navy blue, to red. From sparkles to plaid, from suede, to velvet.</p><p>So much color - so much texture. So many to choose from. Being impulsive, like you are you shut the door. That closet was off limits in your mind, not welcomed for newcomers. Each and every one of those suits looked so expensive \u2014 no doubt they could fund the average family for 6 months.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Marlee\u2019s eyes are questioning as she sits up right in on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d You blurt. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Let\u2019s ugh, let\u2019s do your hair.\u201d You turn away from M for a moment, scolding yourself with a roll of your eye. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marlee shrugs hopping off of the bed. She thought absolutely nothing of anything, and that\u2019s what you loved about your friend most \u2014 she wasn\u2019t a poker, nor a proder for information.</p><p>The camera flashed, and the girls looked back at the photo.</p><p>\u201cWe look HELLA cute!\u201d You exclaim, instantly saving the photo before adding it to your story. You wore a black two piece outfit, the shirt cropped, along with the skirt, short and tight. The heels you decided on were a nice velvet tan, straps that accompanying your calves as they tied up your legs. Marlee\u2019s dress was a pretty blue color, with some simple black heels.</p><p>\u201cI cannot seem to find\u2026\u201d Marlee mumbled as she walked away. She was obviously talking to herself, so you went and applied another coat of sheer lipgloss for good measure. As the smooth substance rounded your lips, Marlee perked. </p><p>\u201cDid you see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>You look to Marlee, and she hold a suit jacket in her hand. It was a maroon-ish color, jewel complementing the start of the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cPut it down!\u201d You \u00a0grabbed the jacket from her, finding the assumed the matching pants for it, and hanging it up again in the closet. \u201cDo you know how much these probably are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no shit. It\u2019s says Gucci on the inside.\u201d</p><p>You slapped her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch then, crazy!\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook how cool they are, though!\u201d Marlee boggled. She walks further into the closet, randomly grabbing another suit jacket. \u201cOooooohh this one\u2019s nice!\u201d She admires the clothing, twisting the hanger back and forth between her fingers to get a glimpse in all directions.</p><p>It was pretty gorgeous. It\u2019s a baby pink shade, and velvet textured. From what it looked like, it had woven frog designs, and crystal embroidery. It was so, so pretty. A fixed look was on your face, as you pouted your head hanging at a limp. </p><p>\u201cWear it.\u201d Marlee said \u2014 no. It wasn\u2019t a statement, let alone a question. More of a command.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?! No! I-it\u2019s not mine!\u201d Marlee drags your name out as you decline.</p><p>\u201cBro, this isn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s house. He probably rented it for the night of something, HE doesn\u2019t even know who this belongs\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that! The person could be at this party!\u201d</p><p>Marlee scoffs, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d It would look so good with your outfit! Just hold it!\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips, snatching the jacket from Marlee, taking a look. It was pretty, and you did like the idea of maybe rocking it, but it wasn\u2019t yours \u2014 you would never.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pure gem right there \u2014 try it on, at least,\u201d Marlee insists.</p><p>You grunt, before mumbling freely, enough for M to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re one for making bad decisions.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO ONE IS HERE BUT US, WOMEN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Gosh.\u201d Your dainty fingers drop the hanger from the jacket, slipping it on. Walking to the mirror in the bathroom with Marlee on your tracks, you feel up the jacket, the soft material lovely under the pads of your fingers.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019quite cute.\u201d Your friend nods with her arms crossed. You look at her wary through the reflection of the large mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wear it. You\u2019re not messy. You\u2019re not incapable. It\u2019s just a few hours.\u201d Staying silent, you look down at the tiled floor. \u201cHey.\u201d You perks your chin, a little hum omitting from the back of your dry throat. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get you a fuck.\u201d </p><p>Marlee bursts at the seams, laughing hysterically at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fuh-nny.\u201d Y/N snickers in between breathes, looking at the jacket once more.</p><p> \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear it?\u201d Marlee asks. She\u2019s like a hyper child, her mood so happy for you to wear a piece of clothing. </p><p>\u201cYes, I guess. It\u2019s really pretty\u2026 but I\u2019m also trusting your word with all my fate that this guy isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh talk about embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>Marlee checks her phone, \u201cIt\u2019s ten. Let\u2019s head down.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>You hated yourself for not bringing Advil.</p><p>With the loud music, crazed screaming matches between people, and the alcoholic beverages, you were done for fairly quickly. It wasn\u2019t necessary to go back upstairs though, as people were everywhere, getting into everything. </p><p>Marlee and you chilled poolside, the water forming an iridescent glow. Twilight hours were long gone, as the sun was setting when y\u2019all first arrived. The only thing providing light now we\u2019re lanterns which were nice and dimmed, making everything pretty with a glow. </p><p>You\u2019d met a few people, one of them being a gal named Evie. She was purple haired, her eyes being a nice blue shade. She\u2019s very \u2018out there\u2019, making it fun to talk and dance with her \u2014 that was until she announced she was going to get more alcohol and never came back. It wasn\u2019t too surprising as her and another guest Nelly hit if off nice. The two women were most definitely somewhere hooking up, but you just hoped they\u2019d come down again after \u2014 they were beyond friendly, and really fun to be around. </p><p>\u201cI still really want those Jell-O shots regardless,\u201d Marlee says, a cocktail in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI can go get them, just stay here so I won\u2019t lose ya.\u201d She nods, pulling out her phone, probably about to capture another moment of this party for social media, as her name is Marlee. You will admit, the party is fun, and nicely decorated with bearable music playing through the speakers. Everyone was nice, and you hadn\u2019t seen anything too manic yet; more people were flooding in though, meaning more food and alcohol was too, and all types of personalities so you never know. The only bothering thing was the ache in your temples, clouding your brain with worried thought more than the drinks. You weren\u2019t wasted, not even a little bit tipsy, but you wouldn\u2019t mad if you got there. </p><p>A Tiki Bar was down farther down the lawn, causing you to have to walk on the plush grass. Plush or not, grass is grass, and you weren\u2019t ready for grass stains on your heels. They were new, (and expensive) and keeping them nice wasn\u2019t mandatory. But you shook off the frustration, and throbbing headache for the sake of having fun. </p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d A long haired blondie that looked as if he surfed the Malibu waves for a living asked. You giggled a bit, as he shimmied with a bright smile, eyebrows prying for an answer. </p><p>You has to raise your voice over the music, \u201cUgh, I just need some Jell-O shots!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDank!\u201d He said going to the mini fridge. Yeah, definitely a surfer, if not just an illiterate goof. </p><p>\u201cDo you reckon some plain vodka shots instead? We\u2019re all out.\u201d He replies. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re nasty plain. I\u2019ll just go inside and find some, thanks, though!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee ya later! Aye, that jacket\u2019s pretty gnarly by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You say more dumbfounded than anything. You can\u2019t resist. \u201cHey, do you surf?\u201d </p><p>His face lit up. \u201cI sure dooooo!\u201d He gushes, carrying the vowel. You giggle \u2014 had to know. </p><p>It was refreshing talking to a dude that just wanted to talk, and wasn\u2019t desperate for your vagina. Honestly, you did want a fuck to relieve stress and sexual tension, but not with a dude that was basically belting with horny hormones. You reminded yourself this wasn\u2019t the college party you were use to, didn\u2019t know everyone. That fuck that was craved was unfortunately out the window. Maybe next time. </p><p>The air wasn\u2019t cool anymore inside the house, as it was taken over by several partiers; more in here than outside. It was a stuffy atmosphere. Dancing caused sweat, and with being in such proximity of a fellow person, it can accommodate a lot of it. Closing the slide door, you maneuvered around the dancing bodies and make out sessions, trying to recall where the kitchen was. </p><p><i>Right? Yeah, go right. </i></p><p><i>Um, down this hall, then left. </i></p><p><i>Fuck no, not left! Dammit, Y/N.</i></p><p><i>Okay, right.</i></p><p><i>NOW left. </i></p><p><i>Okay okay, here we are.</i></p><p>The kitchens fairly empty and clean but to be honest, everything is on this side of the house. All of the sitting areas look pristine and untouched just like they were before. </p><p><i>What if they have Advil somewhere in here? </i></p><p>You can keep Advil in the kitchen\u2026 right? You don\u2019t know. You at least needed some ice, badly, to numb the pounding of your head for 5 minutes before going back out.</p><p>First you open the fridge for good measure, and what do you know, Jell-O shots and more cooled foods with-hold in it. </p><p><i>Now that ice. </i></p><p>Opening cabinets one by one, you look for some type of cups to dispense the ice cubes in. You do find the cups, some glasses reading \u2018Styles\u2019 monogrammed on the front.</p><p><i>What\u2019s with this dude? </i></p><p>\u201cNice jacket.\u201d </p><p>A raspy voice calls from behind you, and you freeze. Your heels turn to see a lean man leaning on the archway to the kitchen. His arms are crossed, an amused smirk playing his lips \u2014 the lips that are really pink. He\u2019s got on a some black jeans, and a casual yellow button up. All in all, he\u2019s cute. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d He reveals. </p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You laugh dryly, not understanding how in world you could be so stupid and follow through with Marlee\u2019s dumb idea. Now you\u2019re here, in the most awkward predicament. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not what it looks like \u2014 you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019cool, s\u2019cool,\u201d He says, \u201cI quite like you in it,\u201d He walks over, observing you closely in the jacket every which way, until he\u2019s in front of you, towering over. \u201cYou look hot. It fits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-thanks.\u201d You can only imagine how stupid you look right now, and you tell yourself to pull it together; it\u2019s failing miserably. A jittery mess you are, only thinking \u00a0about the vibrant color of his eyes, and the little dimple that peaks when he smiles.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhat were ya lookin\u2019 for?\u201d He gestures toward all of the open cabinets, chuckling a bit. </p><p>\u201cIce. Have a headache.\u201d She admits quietly. </p><p>\u201cNo medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t bother looking for any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you bothered rummaging through my closet?\u201d He\u2019s not serious, not mad, more so happy as he keeps chuckling.</p><p>\u201cRafe told us just to pick a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat room is off limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems after I already claimed it.\u201d</p><p>He flashes another starboy smile,his arms crossing nonchalantly. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, do you have Advil? Aspirin? Anything?\u201d You hopes to change the subject, tension getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He says. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He reaches out, his palm asking permission to take yours. You didn\u2019t know what was worse, the fact that you\u2019re blushing has gotten wayyy out of hand from his face, or the fact that you\u2019re still in his Gucci jacket he called you hot in. </p><p>Either way, you took his hand because why the fuck wouldn\u2019t you. </p><p>His stride is so quick she has to damn there run with him to keep up. He didn\u2019t seem to really care too much about the swarm of people, as they pass them no problem and make their way upstairs. It\u2019s darker in the hallway, and a toilet flushes from behind the bathroom door. There\u2019s some foams cups littered up and down the corridor, a random bottle of Hennessy lying upon the hardwood floors. </p><p>Your mouth waters in such way, admiring the random ink on him. You enjoy the spontaneous look of his tattoos, like how there\u2019s a locket chillin above the arrow, or a naked mermaid rounding his forearm; you\u2019re sure that\u2019s your favorite. </p><p>Wait. </p><p><i>What\u2019s his name? </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He opens the door to his bedroom, it being obvious with how big and dominant it is. You doesn\u2019t have to ask, it\u2019s his house they\u2019re in. The room has quite a plain look, but you doesn\u2019t see the harm. With white sheets rounding the King sized bed, and a fur rug centering the room, it\u2019s a nice look. </p><p>You like that, too. </p><p>\u201cHarry. Harry Styles. Yours?\u201d Their hands are detached now as he close the door and makes his way to the more illuminated crevice of his room, his bathroom. You tell him your name, and he nods. </p><p>Your eyebrows quirk as you wonder why this bathroom could literally fit your whole entire room in it, and then some. \u201cMakes since.\u201d You respond, still on the top of names. </p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Harry rummages through a drawer, prying little things out like neglected bobby pins and toothbrush protectors. </p><p>\u201cAnything you can put \u2018Styles\u2019 on, you do.\u201d Absentmindedly, you picks up his soap on the sink, smell it, and then lay it down again. </p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re observant.\u201d Harry stands from his crouching position, after finally finding some pain relievers. There\u2019s a small stack of disposable mouthwash cups and Harry fills one with water to hand to you. He can\u2019t help watching your every move as you toss both small pink tablets into your mouth and gulp down the water. He likes how you hold the cup, your little pinky sticking up as if it\u2019s tea. He also likes how you take notice of his observing and asks him what his problem is right after, too. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just really pretty, s\u2019all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u2026 again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI enjoy seeing you blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I enjoy compliments, so keep them coming.\u201d You joke. He shrugs, that\u2019s not challenging. </p><p>\u201cI like your attitude, you don\u2019t shy away from a comeback,\u201d You hum, and slowly nodding your head. \u201cI like how my Gucci fits you, and how the back hem of it sits right above your bum\u2026 gives the perfect view of it. S\u2019pretty nice.\u201d His slick tone mixed with his accent is heaven in a bottle. </p><p>You take a few steps closer to Harry, biting your lip. His eyes trail up and down your figure once, before completing the eye contact you share \u2014 it\u2019s like a flame is ignited.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019gonna make a move first, or do I have to?\u201d His teases, hands coming up in a surrender way, that dimple showing once again. </p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to ask me twice. </i></p><p>His are soft and cool against your warm ones, and the feeling sends shivers down your spine. His hands grip your hips, and soon, it\u2019s a hot make out session as your tongues say hello to one another, and tangle. </p><p>You\u2019re pulling his hair at the nape of his neck, it\u2019s soft between your fingertips - you enjoys the feeling, and even wonder if it\u2019s the appropriate time to ask him what products he uses; nevermind that. He slides his hands down to grip the curve of her bum, as you get more aggressive with his strands. You take the risk of biting his lip harshly, but to soothe the pain, you suck on it, one hand cradling his jawline. The kiss breaks with a pop sound, both of them catching their absent breathes. </p><p>His pupils are dilated. \u201cHere, or my penthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two houses?\u201d You question. To keep him in your proximity, you tug at his collar. </p><p>\u201cFour. Now which one?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s desperate; you\u2019re feeding off of it.</p><p>You think for a few, leaning your head against Harry\u2019s. He\u2019s fidgety, as his eyelids blink rapidly. The color surprises you everytime he opens them again. </p><p>\u201cTo save you a drive, cause I know you\u2019re about to burst,\u201d You look to his crotch, jeans tightened around his manhood. \u201cWe can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re toxic.\u201d He cradles your jaw, tongues tangling once more, and you relish in the moment because it\u2019s just so nice. His right hand reaches to switch the bathroom light off before tapping your plump bum, signaling to \u2018jump\u2019. Wrapping your legs around his waist, and he effortlessly walks over to the foot of his bed. The bedroom isn\u2019t as bright, as the two bedside lamps are only on. It\u2019s a more comfortable feeling for you \u2014 the perfect lighting for two bodies to explore one another\u2019s. Marlee is forgotten and so are those Jell-O shots.</p><p>Harry releases you to stand on feet, and you have been doing that for awhile, but for some reason it\u2019s more difficult now. Your legs feel like some Jell-O shots, dazed by the events that are occurring so quickly. </p><p>You\u2019re putty in his hands. </p><p>Harry goes to lock the door quickly. After he comes back to see a very giggly and eager you, connecting your lips once more. </p><p><i>God, she\u2019s cute</i>, He thinks. </p><p>With a few tugs, you break the buttons of his shirt from the seams, the little pebble shaped things falling to the floor. With an eager giggling you, and a horny Harold,</p><p>it combines into this moment of absolute chaos. His stomach tattoos are out of this world, who would\u2019ve \u00a0thought to get a butterfly in the middle of their midsection and it look so good? You were amazed, the details of every single one, so intricate, so pretty, and so attractive. </p><p>The left side of your neck is Harry\u2019s new blank canvas, as he nips where he wants. He takes to accountability to find your sweet spot as his rubs up and down your sides, his big hands exploring your closed torso. His wet kisses travel throughout, and you whimper when he finds your spot, that spot that makes you weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d He mutters. </p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d You say back.</p><p>There, in the crevice of your jawline by your ear, he suctions his lips, sucking to break the skin and hopefully in the end, have a purple and pink colored hickey. Your eyes roll back, and you grip what\u2019s left of Harry shirt for dear life. You feel how hard he\u2019s breathing, how much he\u2019s sucking, and it\u2019s phenomenal. These sensations are new again, as you got so caught up in college, unable to experience this sooner. Your mind is refreshed with the feelings and emotion you feel during this type of thing, your underwear dampening in the blink of an eye. </p><p>You take the time to pull his jacket off, carelessly tossing it behind you on the bed as Harry slips off his shirt completely. With raising your arms up, Harry gets the memo you want to be topless \u2014 what he doesn\u2019t know is in order to make this top look good, you couldn\u2019t wear a bra. He fumbles with the material, finally gripping to pulling it over you head. Your breasts spring free of any congestion and the look on Harry\u2019s face is platinum. He like a thirsty dog, looking at his owner desperately as they fill his water bowl. He attacks your sternum area, both hands fiddling with the perky nipples of yours. You bite your lip, the feeling of his wet lips everywhere other than your face unfamiliar, but incredible. </p><p>His tongue is warm, his lips are soft, and boy does he know how to use them. His lips wrap around one of your nipples, and a fatal whimper proceeds to fall from your mouth as you grip onto his shoulders. He detaches just for a second to lay you down on your back, it colliding with the soft mattress. Harry\u2019s body is in between your thighs as he still takes the time to assault your chest, and you don\u2019t mind. You desperately run your fingers through his hair as he switches nipples, a moan pervading from the back of your throat. He loves the feeling of you, the sound of you, everything \u2014 he can only take so much of your sweet and soft moans before he\u2019s fingering around your skirt to pull off. </p><p>You nod your head, lifting your hips slightly to help him remove the material. He\u2019s standing now, towering over you, sure he can now say he\u2019s laid eyes on a real life angel. You\u2019re beautiful. Your lips are plumper and a shade darker from 20 minutes ago, your hair sprawled out on the mattress rounding your head like a crown upon the silk sheets. </p><p>He comes close to you one more time, placing a smooch to your navel, forehead, nose, then lips. You look to possibly deepen the kiss, but it\u2019s obvious Harry\u2019s looking to taste more things \u2014 and not your tongue at the moment. He looks at you with reassurance to naked you completely, which you abide in with a small, \u2018Please.\u2019 H does \u00a0takes time to rid you of the restriction, the simple black thong discarded somewhere in the room. </p><p>With an agonizing pace that makes you want to run yourself into a brick wall, Harry slowly kneels down on his knees. His forearms hook both of your thighs in the process, pulling them over his toned shoulders. Your chest rises, frustrated of his teasing ways as he goes closer to your youth, huffing long, hot, breathes onto it. You guys hold eye contact for a few seconds as he does this, causing you to plead. </p><p>\u201cHa\u2014<i>oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>The sentence is left pathetically broken up, his warm tongue lapping up and down your pussy repeatedly. </p><p>\u201cWet as fuck,\u201d He baits.</p><p>He\u2019s anxious, you taste delicious over his tongue, he can\u2019t help a little grunt of pleasure. You take hold of his mops of curls, at this period still trying to hold in your moans. You\u2019re writhing though, a mess already as your breathing toughens and your hair becoming a bit more frizzy. Your left hand reaches for the Gucci jacket discarded earlier. You hold it close to your chest, the other hand guiding Harry\u2019s head where you want him most; your clit. </p><p>He does follow your liking, applying pressure to the aroused bud with his warm, wet tongue. Your taste is ambrosial, somethings he\u2019s never tasted before \u2014 maybe you\u2019re a combination of honey \u2014 maybe something of citrus \u2014 or just simply you. Voluntarily lifting your legs up higher, with thighs now facing toward the ceiling now, Harry encourages your movements gripping them to stay there. He laps your dripping flower a few more times, liking the pretty moan that erupts from her lips each time he does so. </p><p>\u201cPretty little thing you are. Could assume you tasted good, but not how you do \u2014 delicious.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is raspy and low. You can\u2019t bare to hold back anymore, letting a loud mom rip through you like a bulldozer, the exhilaration of activities encouraging the act. </p><p>He sees you biting onto the Gucci wear, trying to silence yourself, but he\u2019s not having it. He\u2019s craving that noise of yours, the sounds that harden his dick. He stretches his arm, grabbing the Gucci and throwing it behind him. </p><p>\u201cWanna hear you,\u201d He instructs. \u201c\u2018Specially for this.\u201d </p><p>He sinks two fingers in you, a gargled sound erupting from you, a large gasp coming right after. The sounds you make are intangible to control, but neither of you mind \u2014 Harry\u2019s living now, hearing your reaction to his pleasure. He speeds up, your moans speed up, he slows down, you do as well. You feel good better than you have in awhile, and you assume you\u2019re just getting started. He harshly sucks on your clit some more, pumping his digits in and out at a faster pace. Harry \u00a0feels his jeans restraining more than ever, your taste, your moans, and the pulling of his hair too much. He takes his fingers out, a sad whimper coming from the beaut in front of him. He takes one finger at a time, suckling the juices - your juices, off of them, groaning at the taste; it\u2019s more prominent. </p><p>He\u2019s gotta have you. </p><p>Now. </p><p>\u201cHelp me out, love.\u201d He groans as he fumbles with his jeans. You without hesitation sit up, taking over the task of unbuckling everything. A huge amount of tension is liberated from his prick, only his Calvin\u2019s covering it. You\u2019re ready for the thing, ready to cum already with him inside of you. You\u2019ve never desired anything more for awhile, as your life\u2019s been pretty routined lately. </p><p>\u201cI am on the pill, and I\u2019m clean.\u201d You blurt. You want Harry real and raw, and will be damned if a condom stands in the way of that. After all, you really are on the pill and clean of any infections or diseases - you can only imagine Harry\u2019s the same. </p><p>He nods frantically, pupils dilated, the exotic color of his eyes almost gone as only a little green rounds the black. Pulling down his briefs, Harry\u2019s penis slaps his stomach before balancing out. He\u2019s big and swollen, Harry hissing as he kneels down a bit, lining himself with you. He\u2019s sensitive, pre cum drooling out of his tips nastily while he pumps himself. Sitting up on your shoulders, you observe his motion is such way to make Harry think you\u2019re just a desperate as he is. With eyes wild, slightly bloodshot, piercing into his own. </p><p>\u201cLay back, doll.\u201d He orders. Doing so, you reach for his shoulders, wanting a sweet kiss before starting. He give you it, laying on top on you with a forearm by your head. <i>He\u2019s big,</i> you think - <i>but nothing I can\u2019t handle. </i></p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d His apprehension gets the best of him, and even though he knows you\u2019re okay, he can\u2019t help to ask. </p><p>\u201c\u2018M good Harry, I\u2019m good. Just take me,\u201d You plead. He nods, hair coming down over his face and you move it off his forehead, holding one hand there. </p><p>He takes no more stalling time, and slowly eases into you. The longful moan you let out is like angels singing. You don\u2019t necessarily remember the feeling of the last time you had sex, but you know for sure you didn\u2019t feel this full \u2014 you never have. </p><p>\u201cFuuuck - Harry, oh my god.\u201d You drag. You grip his bicep, beckoning him to start moving. </p><p>\u201cAta, girl \u2014 fuck, y-you\u2019re tight.\u201d Harry seizes biting his lip as he gradually picks up speed. You feel him in your tummy, and your wetness can be heard from a mile away as your skin slaps repeatedly. You\u2019re thriving, a mount of tingles already building up inside you. Harry\u2019s pubic hair rushes up and down your clit as he moves, increasing the pressure more. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you like that baby?\u201d You whine a \u2018yeah\u2019 the weakness in your voice heard as your focused on the way he thrusts, fast movements jolting your body. Harry\u2019s forehead has beads of sweat forming as you pull him down for a kiss. Your breath is hot against one another\u2019s, his tongue running over your bottom lip, asking for permission inside. With everything going on as it is, you\u2019re not ready when Harry takes it into his hands to deliver you a hard, deep thrust, causing you to squeal and break contact between mouths. </p><p>You grit at your teeth. \u201cFuck, Har, I need \u2014 I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d He cuts you off. His thrusting hasn\u2019t slowed at all, his breathe heavy as he can\u2019t control himself. You\u2019re so fucking tight, so fucking pretty underneath him. </p><p>\u201cRide you \u2014 I wanna ride you.\u201d You choke.</p><p>Harry wastes no time to turn you two over. He moves up some more on the bed, and you straddle above his hips immediately as you press one hand down on his chest, and use the other to aline yourself with his cock. With your eyes on each other, you sink down, and gasp omitting from both parties. Harry guides you \u00a0firmly with his hands on your hips, slamming you down harder than you ever could on your own. His eyes are focused on the way your breasts are bouncing as y\u2019all continue, you open handedly kneading them to put on a show.</p><p>\u201cNice and wet and tight for me, doll. Couldn\u2019t ask,\u201d He pauses do gulp, \u201cCouldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d He finishes. You can see the vein prominent in his neck, his abs flexing underneath you. You continuously bounce of harder with the help of him, the feeling of getting filled to the brim by his huge cock never expiring. </p><p>You can feel your orgasm creeping up on you, and Harry certainly does too, as he grunts here and there when you tighten around him.</p><p>\u201cH-harry, shit! Harry,\u201d You moan.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, baby. C\u2019mon, say it. Know you want to.\u201d You\u2019re sweating now, pulsing around his cock. You hands plop back on his chest, toes curling at the bubbling sensation growing. \u201cDon\u2019t do it until you tell me, kitten.\u201d He orders. </p><p><i>Fuck,</i> you think.<i> He knows. </i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna \u2014 Harry, I\u2019m gonna cum so hard.\u201d You admit through gasps of breath. Harry\u2019s thumb presses to your clit, rubbing harsh figure eights into the little bud causing you to mewl out loud. </p><p>He smacks your ass with his other hand, and that only coaches you to go faster. \u201cS\u2019that the case? You can cum, baby. Cum nice and hard on my cock.\u201d He coaxes, flicking your clit with his pointer finger. </p><p>That\u2019s your green light, and Harry only speeds up the process by planting his feet on the mattress and thrusting up into you; the bubble in your lower stomach is bursted completely, white blotches forming, prohibiting your eyesight. Not that it mattered as you closed your eyes, collapsing on top of Harry. His skin is sticky, and his hands are clammy as he grabs your ass, to give it a few more thrusts up his dick. You\u2019re riding out your orgasm this way, euphoria washing over you as you moan into his ear tiredly.</p><p>He turns to kiss your temple, your head hidden in the crook of his neck. Soon, he\u2019s cumming too, deep moans of pleasure sounding. You glide your hands up and down his chest, kissing him in random spots. </p><p>You both take the time to calm, maybe after five minutes of you running your nails up and down his scalp, and him tracing miscellaneous circles around your back, he breaks the silence. </p><p>\u201cYou good, baby?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You answer contently. \u201cNever been better.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Harry insists. He looks down at you smiling like a goof, you fluffing his hair. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true!\u201d You protest. \u201cHaven\u2019t has this much fun in awhile\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you enjoyed yourself. Can\u2019t wait to have ya like this again in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said this was gonna happen again?\u201d You joke, eyebrows quirking. He sighs. </p><p>With a swift motion, you\u2019re below him once again as he relaxes between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d He says. \u201cI like ya a lot, and you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d With a quick kiss to your lips, you bop his nose.</p><p>You sarcastically sigh, caressing his cheek, \u201cI suppose we can do this again\u2026\u201d He\u2019s kissing your sternum, pecking the cushion of your breasts. </p><p>\u201cGive it a round two?\u201d He asks, looking up at you. </p><p>\u201cAfter I find my friend.\u201d You say, your pointer finger analyzing you statement. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad friend!\u201d Harry laughs, never knowing in the first place you were here with another person. You laugh along with him, realizing you really are. You left her, for a good hour now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, she\u2019s not a pariah \u2014 meets new pals pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, my vagina\u2019s throbbing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my penis is pulsing, what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! I hear your voice,\u201d Marlee bangs on the door a few times, startling you and H. \u201cYou got that fuck!\u201d From the sound of it, she\u2019s utterly wasted, her words slurring. \u201cHip hip hurray!\u201d She\u2019s yells, banging on the door once more. </p><p>Harry\u2019s laughing, his face scrunched on your chest. \u201cI like her!\u201d </p><p><b>a/n: Soooo that was my first smut. I know it\u2019s not the best, but please be gentle I worked incredibly hard on it.

It\u2019s been 20 minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. 20 minutes since you pulled some bullshit on me as ridiculous and energy killing as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a party, Y/N. A party.\u201d </p><p>You huff. That\u2019s the point. A party. Something you didn\u2019t \u00a0feel like engaging in \u2014 3 hours away. </p><p>\u201cAnd from your attitude, you need a good fucking anyway. Hopefully you\u2019ll find one.\u201d Marlee\u2019s flip flops clack against her heels as she walks over to a very uninterested Y/N, uninterested in her bland attitude. </p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon lovely,\u201d She persuades. \u201cNo class for three days. Why not take advantage of that?\u201d M\u2019s legs sandwich themselves in between her best friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJust tired, and parties aren\u2019t fun anymore; just completely exhausting with hell hangovers.\u201d Your eyes are glued to your cell phone, answering Marlee between gaps of breath, as if you don\u2019t care. </p><p>You don\u2019t. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only if you let yourself get pissy drunk.\u201d</p><p>You look up, eyes tired, brain hurting. \u201cStop being an ass, you understand.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSays the grump!\u201d Marlee argues. \u201cGet up,\u201d She lightly slaps her thigh. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have fun, we\u2019re gonna let loose \u2014 in a huge mansion filled the brim with delicious sushi and expensive alcohol \u2014 we\u2019re not letting you turn this down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting out of this, there\u2019s no point in trying\u2026\u201d</p><p>You grunts lowly. Marlee shrugs, it\u2019s true. Trotting around the corner into the hallway leading to your small bedroom, you go to pack the rest of belongings for the extended stay. </p><p>M stays at the couch, clapping and all smiles. \u201cPack something sexy, and the rest of your makeup!\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t get me a cheese danish! My dress is skin tight, and I\u2019ll be bloated!\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, eat the food.\u201d Sitting down you place the paper bag into Marlee\u2019s lap, sitting the iced coffee\u2019s in the cup holders. Your hands are wet, a feeling you hate. The surface of both of the plastic cups, reacted to their concoctions, making them wet. You plop in the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I love you,\u201d Marlee sing-songed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so.\u201d You start. \u201cWhos party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cousin Rafe\u2019s. He\u2019s rich, therefore kicks it with richies. He has a mansion up in The Hills. It\u2019s gonna be fun. Trust me.\u201d Marlee starts her small car and drives off, the slight sound of music playing from the Starbuck\u2019s speaker outside its building diminishing. It\u2019s a nice day, not too hot to the point where you need to activate the air in the little Toyota, but not too cold where you can\u2019t let the windows down either. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brung up a Rafe before,\u201d You pull out your little bag of necessities for a trip extended like so. There\u2019s nothing too special it\u2019s holding, just a bottle of nail polish, some makeup wipes, and a portable charger. </p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my fave cousin. Aged 24 so not too much of a gap between us. I haven\u2019t seen him in forever, I miss him muchly.\u201d Marlee says. You show the bottle to the black nail polish, before twisting it open. Using a folder from Marlee\u2019s glove compartment, you begin carefully painted your nails, efficiently coating layers. </p><p>Your nostrils flare, \u201cI miss my family too\u2026\u201d Biting your lip quite intensely, you re- think the two words that contemplating your brain, not excited for it to ruin the mood, because it will. Seeing his name notificate your phone earlier was the worst case scenario. </p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve the world I gave him\u2026\u201d You say. Marlee merges onto the highway, glancing quickly at you, seeing you\u2019ve stopped painting to leant back against the leather of the chair. </p><p>\u201cUh. What? Elaborate, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrock texted.\u201d Silence. </p><p>\u201cLovely\u2026\u201d Marlee consoled. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, it\u2019s just\u2026 it threw me off. That\u2019s why I was being a bitch \u2014 I know we hate bitches. Sorry about that.\u201d You breathe with ease, chuckling lightly. Marlee\u2019s relieved Brock doesn\u2019t scare you like he use to, since you have the audacity to crack jokes and all, but her tongue is still fairly dry. Brock wasn\u2019t good to you; you both aren\u2019t blind to that fact. </p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. What did he say?\u201d Marlee\u2019s time was urgent as she gripped the steering wheel causing her knuckles to whiten. The hot pink polish on her nails grew more prominent because of it. </p><p>You turned. \u201cHe missed me.\u201d \u00a0The response was simple and short, but complete. \u201cAnd I panicked, so I ignored him. And that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He doesn\u2019t deserve you. Just like you said \u2014 he didn\u2019t deserve the world you gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t. I\u2019m excited for the party now, though,\u201d</p><p>You say, blowing on your thumb. \u201cAnd maybe that fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBIIIITCH!\u201d Marlee nudges you. \u201cMaybe you can find a hot CEO or something.\u201d The girls laugh. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that rich?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cYes. Rafe is THAT rich.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s gonna try to get with you the minute he sees you, he\u2019s always been that way. I won\u2019t let him though, so, don\u2019t mind some cringey pickup lines if he\u2019s bold to try them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d You abides, nodding. </p><p>\u2022</p><p>The mansion is definitely a mansion. Using the code Rafe texted Marlee with just 30 more minutes to go of the drive, the girls emerged in the subdivision, with awe written across their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat do these people do?\u201d You had asked, completely flabbergasted. Marlee giggled, she shoulders bouncing with every breath released. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious! Because I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m in college right now if I can\u2019t have THIS when I get out.\u201d You wail your arms around, referring to the lavish cars in people\u2019s driveways, the fresh, plush grass paving their yards. It\u2019s almost like you can smell the wealth lingering in the air. </p><p>\u201cI think this is the one,\u201d Marlee mutters. She activates the turning signal, turning into one of the nicest homes on the block. Several trucks whether it be a G Wagon, a Jeep, or Range Rover chill to the side of the driveway, a parking lot type thing going on. They\u2019re all elaborate colors like lime green or a bright orange, and each license plate reads \u2018Styles\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s hotter in the Hidden Hills, most definitely. Your sweatshirt had to come off as soon as you guys hit the Calabasas welcoming sign. And from what it seems, it\u2019s only going to get hotter.</p><p>Taking a wild guess you\u2019re sure this is Rafe, as Marlee jumps out of the car to run into the arms of the man walking outside. His skill is tan, and his body is lean. He looks intimidating, but that\u2019s to be expected with wealth trailing behind you. </p><p>\u201cHey, how are you?\u201d He says, accepting Marlee\u2019s hug. He seems nice, you think. Standing awkwardly a few feet away from the reunited family members, you giving them all the time they need to rekindle, patiently waiting as you hug your midsection.</p><p>\u201cThis is my best friend, Y/N.\u201d Marlee gestures toward Rafe, waving her over.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s nice to meet you!\u201d You reaches your hand out, and Rafe gives a closed mouth smile, accepting it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I hope both of you girls have a lot of fun tonight \u2014 though I\u2019d just invite ya, having not seen ya in awhile.\u201d Rafe sideyes you, his tongue peeking out of his lip slightly. Oh, fuck.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t my house,\u201d He falters. Oh.</p><p>\u201cBut, if you go upstairs, and make your way down the hallway and around the corner to the left, you can choose any of those rooms to claim for the night. The party starts at 9, and doesn\u2019t end until people start leaving which isn\u2019t until like 3am. I\u2019ll be out back by the pool, have fun.\u201d And with that, he starts for the perimeter of the house, going out back. Okay.</p><p>\u2022</p><p>\u201cBiiitch we need to cut it out!\u201d Marlee\u2019s whispers, but doesn\u2019t as she giggles getting too much.</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to!\u201d You exclaim, looking around your chosen room. You guys have ran around every inch and of the home you could find on the main and second floor, but not opening doors for the sake of the home owner. The ones that were open though, you didn\u2019t mind taking a peek in. In all, you came across a pool room, a fitness room, an arcade, and a theater along with some bland rooms that simply had nothing occupying them \u2014maybe a chair, or neglected desk. Eventually, ya\u2019ll did follow Rafes directions in actually claiming a bedroom. Like little giddy girls squealing over Zach Efron at a 6th grade sleepover, you freaked about this too, cherishing the \u2018luxury life\u2019 \u2014 and just having a little fun, for a tiny bit.</p><p>\u201cAlright, alright, open the makeup cases and put them on the counter.\u201d Marlee said. You did so, turning on the lights to the connected bathroom. After, grabbing you and M\u2019s bags, you found the closet to sit the clothes for the time being in. </p><p>Suits.</p><p>Lots of suits.</p><p>From purple, to pink, from navy blue, to red. From sparkles to plaid, from suede, to velvet.</p><p>So much color - so much texture. So many to choose from. Being impulsive, like you are you shut the door. That closet was off limits in your mind, not welcomed for newcomers. Each and every one of those suits looked so expensive \u2014 no doubt they could fund the average family for 6 months.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Marlee\u2019s eyes are questioning as she sits up right in on the bed. </p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d You blurt. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Let\u2019s ugh, let\u2019s do your hair.\u201d You turn away from M for a moment, scolding yourself with a roll of your eye. </p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marlee shrugs hopping off of the bed. She thought absolutely nothing of anything, and that\u2019s what you loved about your friend most \u2014 she wasn\u2019t a poker, nor a proder for information.</p><p>The camera flashed, and the girls looked back at the photo.</p><p>\u201cWe look HELLA cute!\u201d You exclaim, instantly saving the photo before adding it to your story. You wore a black two piece outfit, the shirt cropped, along with the skirt, short and tight. The heels you decided on were a nice velvet tan, straps that accompanying your calves as they tied up your legs. Marlee\u2019s dress was a pretty blue color, with some simple black heels.</p><p>\u201cI cannot seem to find\u2026\u201d Marlee mumbled as she walked away. She was obviously talking to herself, so you went and applied another coat of sheer lipgloss for good measure. As the smooth substance rounded your lips, Marlee perked. </p><p>\u201cDid you see this earlier?\u201d</p><p>You look to Marlee, and she hold a suit jacket in her hand. It was a maroon-ish color, jewel complementing the start of the sleeves.</p><p>\u201cPut it down!\u201d You \u00a0grabbed the jacket from her, finding the assumed the matching pants for it, and hanging it up again in the closet. \u201cDo you know how much these probably are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no shit. It\u2019s says Gucci on the inside.\u201d</p><p>You slapped her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch then, crazy!\u201d </p><p>\u201cLook how cool they are, though!\u201d Marlee boggled. She walks further into the closet, randomly grabbing another suit jacket. \u201cOooooohh this one\u2019s nice!\u201d She admires the clothing, twisting the hanger back and forth between her fingers to get a glimpse in all directions.</p><p>It was pretty gorgeous. It\u2019s a baby pink shade, and velvet textured. From what it looked like, it had woven frog designs, and crystal embroidery. It was so, so pretty. A fixed look was on your face, as you pouted your head hanging at a limp. </p><p>\u201cWear it.\u201d Marlee said \u2014 no. It wasn\u2019t a statement, let alone a question. More of a command.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?! No! I-it\u2019s not mine!\u201d Marlee drags your name out as you decline.</p><p>\u201cBro, this isn\u2019t Rafe\u2019s house. He probably rented it for the night of something, HE doesn\u2019t even know who this belongs\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that! The person could be at this party!\u201d</p><p>Marlee scoffs, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d It would look so good with your outfit! Just hold it!\u201d</p><p>You purse your lips, snatching the jacket from Marlee, taking a look. It was pretty, and you did like the idea of maybe rocking it, but it wasn\u2019t yours \u2014 you would never.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pure gem right there \u2014 try it on, at least,\u201d Marlee insists.</p><p>You grunt, before mumbling freely, enough for M to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re one for making bad decisions.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNO ONE IS HERE BUT US, WOMEN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Gosh.\u201d Your dainty fingers drop the hanger from the jacket, slipping it on. Walking to the mirror in the bathroom with Marlee on your tracks, you feel up the jacket, the soft material lovely under the pads of your fingers.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019quite cute.\u201d Your friend nods with her arms crossed. You look at her wary through the reflection of the large mirror.</p><p>\u201cIt is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wear it. You\u2019re not messy. You\u2019re not incapable. It\u2019s just a few hours.\u201d Staying silent, you look down at the tiled floor. \u201cHey.\u201d You perks your chin, a little hum omitting from the back of your dry throat. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get you a fuck.\u201d </p><p>Marlee bursts at the seams, laughing hysterically at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fuh-nny.\u201d Y/N snickers in between breathes, looking at the jacket once more.</p><p> \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear it?\u201d Marlee asks. She\u2019s like a hyper child, her mood so happy for you to wear a piece of clothing. </p><p>\u201cYes, I guess. It\u2019s really pretty\u2026 but I\u2019m also trusting your word with all my fate that this guy isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsh talk about embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>Marlee checks her phone, \u201cIt\u2019s ten. Let\u2019s head down.\u201d</p><p>\u2022</p><p>You hated yourself for not bringing Advil.</p><p>With the loud music, crazed screaming matches between people, and the alcoholic beverages, you were done for fairly quickly. It wasn\u2019t necessary to go back upstairs though, as people were everywhere, getting into everything. </p><p>Marlee and you chilled poolside, the water forming an iridescent glow. Twilight hours were long gone, as the sun was setting when y\u2019all first arrived. The only thing providing light now we\u2019re lanterns which were nice and dimmed, making everything pretty with a glow. </p><p>You\u2019d met a few people, one of them being a gal named Evie. She was purple haired, her eyes being a nice blue shade. She\u2019s very \u2018out there\u2019, making it fun to talk and dance with her \u2014 that was until she announced she was going to get more alcohol and never came back. It wasn\u2019t too surprising as her and another guest Nelly hit if off nice. The two women were most definitely somewhere hooking up, but you just hoped they\u2019d come down again after \u2014 they were beyond friendly, and really fun to be around. </p><p>\u201cI still really want those Jell-O shots regardless,\u201d Marlee says, a cocktail in one hand.</p><p>\u201cI can go get them, just stay here so I won\u2019t lose ya.\u201d She nods, pulling out her phone, probably about to capture another moment of this party for social media, as her name is Marlee. You will admit, the party is fun, and nicely decorated with bearable music playing through the speakers. Everyone was nice, and you hadn\u2019t seen anything too manic yet; more people were flooding in though, meaning more food and alcohol was too, and all types of personalities so you never know. The only bothering thing was the ache in your temples, clouding your brain with worried thought more than the drinks. You weren\u2019t wasted, not even a little bit tipsy, but you wouldn\u2019t mad if you got there. </p><p>A Tiki Bar was down farther down the lawn, causing you to have to walk on the plush grass. Plush or not, grass is grass, and you weren\u2019t ready for grass stains on your heels. They were new, (and expensive) and keeping them nice wasn\u2019t mandatory. But you shook off the frustration, and throbbing headache for the sake of having fun. </p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d A long haired blondie that looked as if he surfed the Malibu waves for a living asked. You giggled a bit, as he shimmied with a bright smile, eyebrows prying for an answer. </p><p>You has to raise your voice over the music, \u201cUgh, I just need some Jell-O shots!\u201d </p><p>\u201cDank!\u201d He said going to the mini fridge. Yeah, definitely a surfer, if not just an illiterate goof. </p><p>\u201cDo you reckon some plain vodka shots instead? We\u2019re all out.\u201d He replies. </p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re nasty plain. I\u2019ll just go inside and find some, thanks, though!\u201d </p><p>\u201cSee ya later! Aye, that jacket\u2019s pretty gnarly by the way.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d You say more dumbfounded than anything. You can\u2019t resist. \u201cHey, do you surf?\u201d </p><p>His face lit up. \u201cI sure dooooo!\u201d He gushes, carrying the vowel. You giggle \u2014 had to know. </p><p>It was refreshing talking to a dude that just wanted to talk, and wasn\u2019t desperate for your vagina. Honestly, you did want a fuck to relieve stress and sexual tension, but not with a dude that was basically belting with horny hormones. You reminded yourself this wasn\u2019t the college party you were use to, didn\u2019t know everyone. That fuck that was craved was unfortunately out the window. Maybe next time. </p><p>The air wasn\u2019t cool anymore inside the house, as it was taken over by several partiers; more in here than outside. It was a stuffy atmosphere. Dancing caused sweat, and with being in such proximity of a fellow person, it can accommodate a lot of it. Closing the slide door, you maneuvered around the dancing bodies and make out sessions, trying to recall where the kitchen was. </p><p><i>Right? Yeah, go right. </i></p><p><i>Um, down this hall, then left. </i></p><p><i>Fuck no, not left! Dammit, Y/N.</i></p><p><i>Okay, right.</i></p><p><i>NOW left. </i></p><p><i>Okay okay, here we are.</i></p><p>The kitchens fairly empty and clean but to be honest, everything is on this side of the house. All of the sitting areas look pristine and untouched just like they were before. </p><p><i>What if they have Advil somewhere in here? </i></p><p>You can keep Advil in the kitchen\u2026 right? You don\u2019t know. You at least needed some ice, badly, to numb the pounding of your head for 5 minutes before going back out.</p><p>First you open the fridge for good measure, and what do you know, Jell-O shots and more cooled foods with-hold in it. </p><p><i>Now that ice. </i></p><p>Opening cabinets one by one, you look for some type of cups to dispense the ice cubes in. You do find the cups, some glasses reading \u2018Styles\u2019 monogrammed on the front.</p><p><i>What\u2019s with this dude? </i></p><p>\u201cNice jacket.\u201d </p><p>A raspy voice calls from behind you, and you freeze. Your heels turn to see a lean man leaning on the archway to the kitchen. His arms are crossed, an amused smirk playing his lips \u2014 the lips that are really pink. He\u2019s got on a some black jeans, and a casual yellow button up. All in all, he\u2019s cute. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d He reveals. </p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You laugh dryly, not understanding how in world you could be so stupid and follow through with Marlee\u2019s dumb idea. Now you\u2019re here, in the most awkward predicament. </p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not what it looks like \u2014 you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019cool, s\u2019cool,\u201d He says, \u201cI quite like you in it,\u201d He walks over, observing you closely in the jacket every which way, until he\u2019s in front of you, towering over. \u201cYou look hot. It fits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-thanks.\u201d You can only imagine how stupid you look right now, and you tell yourself to pull it together; it\u2019s failing miserably. A jittery mess you are, only thinking \u00a0about the vibrant color of his eyes, and the little dimple that peaks when he smiles.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhat were ya lookin\u2019 for?\u201d He gestures toward all of the open cabinets, chuckling a bit. </p><p>\u201cIce. Have a headache.\u201d She admits quietly. </p><p>\u201cNo medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t bother looking for any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you bothered rummaging through my closet?\u201d He\u2019s not serious, not mad, more so happy as he keeps chuckling.</p><p>\u201cRafe told us just to pick a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat room is off limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems after I already claimed it.\u201d</p><p>He flashes another starboy smile,his arms crossing nonchalantly. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, do you have Advil? Aspirin? Anything?\u201d You hopes to change the subject, tension getting the best of you.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He says. \u201cFollow me.\u201d He reaches out, his palm asking permission to take yours. You didn\u2019t know what was worse, the fact that you\u2019re blushing has gotten wayyy out of hand from his face, or the fact that you\u2019re still in his Gucci jacket he called you hot in. </p><p>Either way, you took his hand because why the fuck wouldn\u2019t you. </p><p>His stride is so quick she has to damn there run with him to keep up. He didn\u2019t seem to really care too much about the swarm of people, as they pass them no problem and make their way upstairs. It\u2019s darker in the hallway, and a toilet flushes from behind the bathroom door. There\u2019s some foams cups littered up and down the corridor, a random bottle of Hennessy lying upon the hardwood floors. </p><p>Your mouth waters in such way, admiring the random ink on him. You enjoy the spontaneous look of his tattoos, like how there\u2019s a locket chillin above the arrow, or a naked mermaid rounding his forearm; you\u2019re sure that\u2019s your favorite. </p><p>Wait. </p><p><i>What\u2019s his name? </i></p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He opens the door to his bedroom, it being obvious with how big and dominant it is. You doesn\u2019t have to ask, it\u2019s his house they\u2019re in. The room has quite a plain look, but you doesn\u2019t see the harm. With white sheets rounding the King sized bed, and a fur rug centering the room, it\u2019s a nice look. </p><p>You like that, too. </p><p>\u201cHarry. Harry Styles. Yours?\u201d Their hands are detached now as he close the door and makes his way to the more illuminated crevice of his room, his bathroom. You tell him your name, and he nods. </p><p>Your eyebrows quirk as you wonder why this bathroom could literally fit your whole entire room in it, and then some. \u201cMakes since.\u201d You respond, still on the top of names. </p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Harry rummages through a drawer, prying little things out like neglected bobby pins and toothbrush protectors. </p><p>\u201cAnything you can put \u2018Styles\u2019 on, you do.\u201d Absentmindedly, you picks up his soap on the sink, smell it, and then lay it down again. </p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re observant.\u201d Harry stands from his crouching position, after finally finding some pain relievers. There\u2019s a small stack of disposable mouthwash cups and Harry fills one with water to hand to you. He can\u2019t help watching your every move as you toss both small pink tablets into your mouth and gulp down the water. He likes how you hold the cup, your little pinky sticking up as if it\u2019s tea. He also likes how you take notice of his observing and asks him what his problem is right after, too. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just really pretty, s\u2019all.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThanks\u2026 again.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI enjoy seeing you blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I enjoy compliments, so keep them coming.\u201d You joke. He shrugs, that\u2019s not challenging. </p><p>\u201cI like your attitude, you don\u2019t shy away from a comeback,\u201d You hum, and slowly nodding your head. \u201cI like how my Gucci fits you, and how the back hem of it sits right above your bum\u2026 gives the perfect view of it. S\u2019pretty nice.\u201d His slick tone mixed with his accent is heaven in a bottle. </p><p>You take a few steps closer to Harry, biting your lip. His eyes trail up and down your figure once, before completing the eye contact you share \u2014 it\u2019s like a flame is ignited.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019gonna make a move first, or do I have to?\u201d His teases, hands coming up in a surrender way, that dimple showing once again. </p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to ask me twice. </i></p><p>His are soft and cool against your warm ones, and the feeling sends shivers down your spine. His hands grip your hips, and soon, it\u2019s a hot make out session as your tongues say hello to one another, and tangle. </p><p>You\u2019re pulling his hair at the nape of his neck, it\u2019s soft between your fingertips - you enjoys the feeling, and even wonder if it\u2019s the appropriate time to ask him what products he uses; nevermind that. He slides his hands down to grip the curve of her bum, as you get more aggressive with his strands. You take the risk of biting his lip harshly, but to soothe the pain, you suck on it, one hand cradling his jawline. The kiss breaks with a pop sound, both of them catching their absent breathes. </p><p>His pupils are dilated. \u201cHere, or my penthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have two houses?\u201d You question. To keep him in your proximity, you tug at his collar. </p><p>\u201cFour. Now which one?\u201d </p><p>He\u2019s desperate; you\u2019re feeding off of it.</p><p>You think for a few, leaning your head against Harry\u2019s. He\u2019s fidgety, as his eyelids blink rapidly. The color surprises you everytime he opens them again. </p><p>\u201cTo save you a drive, cause I know you\u2019re about to burst,\u201d You look to his crotch, jeans tightened around his manhood. \u201cWe can stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re toxic.\u201d He cradles your jaw, tongues tangling once more, and you relish in the moment because it\u2019s just so nice. His right hand reaches to switch the bathroom light off before tapping your plump bum, signaling to \u2018jump\u2019. Wrapping your legs around his waist, and he effortlessly walks over to the foot of his bed. The bedroom isn\u2019t as bright, as the two bedside lamps are only on. It\u2019s a more comfortable feeling for you \u2014 the perfect lighting for two bodies to explore one another\u2019s. Marlee is forgotten and so are those Jell-O shots.</p><p>Harry releases you to stand on feet, and you have been doing that for awhile, but for some reason it\u2019s more difficult now. Your legs feel like some Jell-O shots, dazed by the events that are occurring so quickly. </p><p>You\u2019re putty in his hands. </p><p>Harry goes to lock the door quickly. After he comes back to see a very giggly and eager you, connecting your lips once more. </p><p><i>God, she\u2019s cute</i>, He thinks. </p><p>With a few tugs, you break the buttons of his shirt from the seams, the little pebble shaped things falling to the floor. With an eager giggling you, and a horny Harold,</p><p>it combines into this moment of absolute chaos. His stomach tattoos are out of this world, who would\u2019ve \u00a0thought to get a butterfly in the middle of their midsection and it look so good? You were amazed, the details of every single one, so intricate, so pretty, and so attractive. </p><p>The left side of your neck is Harry\u2019s new blank canvas, as he nips where he wants. He takes to accountability to find your sweet spot as his rubs up and down your sides, his big hands exploring your closed torso. His wet kisses travel throughout, and you whimper when he finds your spot, that spot that makes you weak in the knees. </p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d He mutters. </p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d You say back.</p><p>There, in the crevice of your jawline by your ear, he suctions his lips, sucking to break the skin and hopefully in the end, have a purple and pink colored hickey. Your eyes roll back, and you grip what\u2019s left of Harry shirt for dear life. You feel how hard he\u2019s breathing, how much he\u2019s sucking, and it\u2019s phenomenal. These sensations are new again, as you got so caught up in college, unable to experience this sooner. Your mind is refreshed with the feelings and emotion you feel during this type of thing, your underwear dampening in the blink of an eye. </p><p>You take the time to pull his jacket off, carelessly tossing it behind you on the bed as Harry slips off his shirt completely. With raising your arms up, Harry gets the memo you want to be topless \u2014 what he doesn\u2019t know is in order to make this top look good, you couldn\u2019t wear a bra. He fumbles with the material, finally gripping to pulling it over you head. Your breasts spring free of any congestion and the look on Harry\u2019s face is platinum. He like a thirsty dog, looking at his owner desperately as they fill his water bowl. He attacks your sternum area, both hands fiddling with the perky nipples of yours. You bite your lip, the feeling of his wet lips everywhere other than your face unfamiliar, but incredible. </p><p>His tongue is warm, his lips are soft, and boy does he know how to use them. His lips wrap around one of your nipples, and a fatal whimper proceeds to fall from your mouth as you grip onto his shoulders. He detaches just for a second to lay you down on your back, it colliding with the soft mattress. Harry\u2019s body is in between your thighs as he still takes the time to assault your chest, and you don\u2019t mind. You desperately run your fingers through his hair as he switches nipples, a moan pervading from the back of your throat. He loves the feeling of you, the sound of you, everything \u2014 he can only take so much of your sweet and soft moans before he\u2019s fingering around your skirt to pull off. </p><p>You nod your head, lifting your hips slightly to help him remove the material. He\u2019s standing now, towering over you, sure he can now say he\u2019s laid eyes on a real life angel. You\u2019re beautiful. Your lips are plumper and a shade darker from 20 minutes ago, your hair sprawled out on the mattress rounding your head like a crown upon the silk sheets. </p><p>He comes close to you one more time, placing a smooch to your navel, forehead, nose, then lips. You look to possibly deepen the kiss, but it\u2019s obvious Harry\u2019s looking to taste more things \u2014 and not your tongue at the moment. He looks at you with reassurance to naked you completely, which you abide in with a small, \u2018Please.\u2019 H does \u00a0takes time to rid you of the restriction, the simple black thong discarded somewhere in the room. </p><p>With an agonizing pace that makes you want to run yourself into a brick wall, Harry slowly kneels down on his knees. His forearms hook both of your thighs in the process, pulling them over his toned shoulders. Your chest rises, frustrated of his teasing ways as he goes closer to your youth, huffing long, hot, breathes onto it. You guys hold eye contact for a few seconds as he does this, causing you to plead. </p><p>\u201cHa\u2014<i>oh</i>.\u201d </p><p>The sentence is left pathetically broken up, his warm tongue lapping up and down your pussy repeatedly. </p><p>\u201cWet as fuck,\u201d He baits.</p><p>He\u2019s anxious, you taste delicious over his tongue, he can\u2019t help a little grunt of pleasure. You take hold of his mops of curls, at this period still trying to hold in your moans. You\u2019re writhing though, a mess already as your breathing toughens and your hair becoming a bit more frizzy. Your left hand reaches for the Gucci jacket discarded earlier. You hold it close to your chest, the other hand guiding Harry\u2019s head where you want him most; your clit. </p><p>He does follow your liking, applying pressure to the aroused bud with his warm, wet tongue. Your taste is ambrosial, somethings he\u2019s never tasted before \u2014 maybe you\u2019re a combination of honey \u2014 maybe something of citrus \u2014 or just simply you. Voluntarily lifting your legs up higher, with thighs now facing toward the ceiling now, Harry encourages your movements gripping them to stay there. He laps your dripping flower a few more times, liking the pretty moan that erupts from her lips each time he does so. </p><p>\u201cPretty little thing you are. Could assume you tasted good, but not how you do \u2014 delicious.\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is raspy and low. You can\u2019t bare to hold back anymore, letting a loud mom rip through you like a bulldozer, the exhilaration of activities encouraging the act. </p><p>He sees you biting onto the Gucci wear, trying to silence yourself, but he\u2019s not having it. He\u2019s craving that noise of yours, the sounds that harden his dick. He stretches his arm, grabbing the Gucci and throwing it behind him. </p><p>\u201cWanna hear you,\u201d He instructs. \u201c\u2018Specially for this.\u201d </p><p>He sinks two fingers in you, a gargled sound erupting from you, a large gasp coming right after. The sounds you make are intangible to control, but neither of you mind \u2014 Harry\u2019s living now, hearing your reaction to his pleasure. He speeds up, your moans speed up, he slows down, you do as well. You feel good better than you have in awhile, and you assume you\u2019re just getting started. He harshly sucks on your clit some more, pumping his digits in and out at a faster pace. Harry \u00a0feels his jeans restraining more than ever, your taste, your moans, and the pulling of his hair too much. He takes his fingers out, a sad whimper coming from the beaut in front of him. He takes one finger at a time, suckling the juices - your juices, off of them, groaning at the taste; it\u2019s more prominent. </p><p>He\u2019s gotta have you. </p><p>Now. </p><p>\u201cHelp me out, love.\u201d He groans as he fumbles with his jeans. You without hesitation sit up, taking over the task of unbuckling everything. A huge amount of tension is liberated from his prick, only his Calvin\u2019s covering it. You\u2019re ready for the thing, ready to cum already with him inside of you. You\u2019ve never desired anything more for awhile, as your life\u2019s been pretty routined lately. </p><p>\u201cI am on the pill, and I\u2019m clean.\u201d You blurt. You want Harry real and raw, and will be damned if a condom stands in the way of that. After all, you really are on the pill and clean of any infections or diseases - you can only imagine Harry\u2019s the same. </p><p>He nods frantically, pupils dilated, the exotic color of his eyes almost gone as only a little green rounds the black. Pulling down his briefs, Harry\u2019s penis slaps his stomach before balancing out. He\u2019s big and swollen, Harry hissing as he kneels down a bit, lining himself with you. He\u2019s sensitive, pre cum drooling out of his tips nastily while he pumps himself. Sitting up on your shoulders, you observe his motion is such way to make Harry think you\u2019re just a desperate as he is. With eyes wild, slightly bloodshot, piercing into his own. </p><p>\u201cLay back, doll.\u201d He orders. Doing so, you reach for his shoulders, wanting a sweet kiss before starting. He give you it, laying on top on you with a forearm by your head. <i>He\u2019s big,</i> you think - <i>but nothing I can\u2019t handle. </i></p><p>\u201cYou good?\u201d His apprehension gets the best of him, and even though he knows you\u2019re okay, he can\u2019t help to ask. </p><p>\u201c\u2018M good Harry, I\u2019m good. Just take me,\u201d You plead. He nods, hair coming down over his face and you move it off his forehead, holding one hand there. </p><p>He takes no more stalling time, and slowly eases into you. The longful moan you let out is like angels singing. You don\u2019t necessarily remember the feeling of the last time you had sex, but you know for sure you didn\u2019t feel this full \u2014 you never have. </p><p>\u201cFuuuck - Harry, oh my god.\u201d You drag. You grip his bicep, beckoning him to start moving. </p><p>\u201cAta, girl \u2014 fuck, y-you\u2019re tight.\u201d Harry seizes biting his lip as he gradually picks up speed. You feel him in your tummy, and your wetness can be heard from a mile away as your skin slaps repeatedly. You\u2019re thriving, a mount of tingles already building up inside you. Harry\u2019s pubic hair rushes up and down your clit as he moves, increasing the pressure more. </p><p>\u201cFuck, you like that baby?\u201d You whine a \u2018yeah\u2019 the weakness in your voice heard as your focused on the way he thrusts, fast movements jolting your body. Harry\u2019s forehead has beads of sweat forming as you pull him down for a kiss. Your breath is hot against one another\u2019s, his tongue running over your bottom lip, asking for permission inside. With everything going on as it is, you\u2019re not ready when Harry takes it into his hands to deliver you a hard, deep thrust, causing you to squeal and break contact between mouths. </p><p>You grit at your teeth. \u201cFuck, Har, I need \u2014 I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do ya need?\u201d He cuts you off. His thrusting hasn\u2019t slowed at all, his breathe heavy as he can\u2019t control himself. You\u2019re so fucking tight, so fucking pretty underneath him. </p><p>\u201cRide you \u2014 I wanna ride you.\u201d You choke.</p><p>Harry wastes no time to turn you two over. He moves up some more on the bed, and you straddle above his hips immediately as you press one hand down on his chest, and use the other to aline yourself with his cock. With your eyes on each other, you sink down, and gasp omitting from both parties. Harry guides you \u00a0firmly with his hands on your hips, slamming you down harder than you ever could on your own. His eyes are focused on the way your breasts are bouncing as y\u2019all continue, you open handedly kneading them to put on a show.</p><p>\u201cNice and wet and tight for me, doll. Couldn\u2019t ask,\u201d He pauses do gulp, \u201cCouldn\u2019t ask for anything better.\u201d He finishes. You can see the vein prominent in his neck, his abs flexing underneath you. You continuously bounce of harder with the help of him, the feeling of getting filled to the brim by his huge cock never expiring. </p><p>You can feel your orgasm creeping up on you, and Harry certainly does too, as he grunts here and there when you tighten around him.</p><p>\u201cH-harry, shit! Harry,\u201d You moan.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, baby. C\u2019mon, say it. Know you want to.\u201d You\u2019re sweating now, pulsing around his cock. You hands plop back on his chest, toes curling at the bubbling sensation growing. \u201cDon\u2019t do it until you tell me, kitten.\u201d He orders. </p><p><i>Fuck,</i> you think.<i> He knows. </i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna \u2014 Harry, I\u2019m gonna cum so hard.\u201d You admit through gasps of breath. Harry\u2019s thumb presses to your clit, rubbing harsh figure eights into the little bud causing you to mewl out loud. </p><p>He smacks your ass with his other hand, and that only coaches you to go faster. \u201cS\u2019that the case? You can cum, baby. Cum nice and hard on my cock.\u201d He coaxes, flicking your clit with his pointer finger. </p><p>That\u2019s your green light, and Harry only speeds up the process by planting his feet on the mattress and thrusting up into you; the bubble in your lower stomach is bursted completely, white blotches forming, prohibiting your eyesight. Not that it mattered as you closed your eyes, collapsing on top of Harry. His skin is sticky, and his hands are clammy as he grabs your ass, to give it a few more thrusts up his dick. You\u2019re riding out your orgasm this way, euphoria washing over you as you moan into his ear tiredly.</p><p>He turns to kiss your temple, your head hidden in the crook of his neck. Soon, he\u2019s cumming too, deep moans of pleasure sounding. You glide your hands up and down his chest, kissing him in random spots. </p><p>You both take the time to calm, maybe after five minutes of you running your nails up and down his scalp, and him tracing miscellaneous circles around your back, he breaks the silence. </p><p>\u201cYou good, baby?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d You answer contently. \u201cNever been better.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s a stretch,\u201d Harry insists. He looks down at you smiling like a goof, you fluffing his hair. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true!\u201d You protest. \u201cHaven\u2019t has this much fun in awhile\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you enjoyed yourself. Can\u2019t wait to have ya like this again in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said this was gonna happen again?\u201d You joke, eyebrows quirking. He sighs. </p><p>With a swift motion, you\u2019re below him once again as he relaxes between your thighs. </p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d He says. \u201cI like ya a lot, and you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d With a quick kiss to your lips, you bop his nose.</p><p>You sarcastically sigh, caressing his cheek, \u201cI suppose we can do this again\u2026\u201d He\u2019s kissing your sternum, pecking the cushion of your breasts. </p><p>\u201cGive it a round two?\u201d He asks, looking up at you. </p><p>\u201cAfter I find my friend.\u201d You say, your pointer finger analyzing you statement. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad friend!\u201d Harry laughs, never knowing in the first place you were here with another person. You laugh along with him, realizing you really are. You left her, for a good hour now. </p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, she\u2019s not a pariah \u2014 meets new pals pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, my vagina\u2019s throbbing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my penis is pulsing, what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N! I hear your voice,\u201d Marlee bangs on the door a few times, startling you and H. \u201cYou got that fuck!\u201d From the sound of it, she\u2019s utterly wasted, her words slurring. \u201cHip hip hurray!\u201d She\u2019s yells, banging on the door once more. </p><p>Harry\u2019s laughing, his face scrunched on your chest. \u201cI like her!\u201d </p><p><b>a/n: Soooo that was my first smut.

It&rsquo;s been 20 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. 20 minutes since you pulled some bullshit on me as ridiculous and energy killing as that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a party, Y/N. A party.&rdquo; </p><p>You huff. That&rsquo;s the point. A party. Something you didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;feel like engaging in &mdash; 3 hours away. </p><p>&ldquo;And from your attitude, you need a good fucking anyway. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find one.&rdquo; Marlee&rsquo;s flip flops clack against her heels as she walks over to a very uninterested Y/N, uninterested in her bland attitude. </p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon lovely,&rdquo; She persuades. &ldquo;No class for three days. Why not take advantage of that?&rdquo; M&rsquo;s legs sandwich themselves in between her best friend&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Just tired, and parties aren&rsquo;t fun anymore; just completely exhausting with hell hangovers.&rdquo; Your eyes are glued to your cell phone, answering Marlee between gaps of breath, as if you don&rsquo;t care. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t. </p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only if you let yourself get pissy drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>You look up, eyes tired, brain hurting. &ldquo;Stop being an ass, you understand.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Says the grump!&rdquo; Marlee argues. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; She lightly slaps her thigh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna have fun, we&rsquo;re gonna let loose &mdash; in a huge mansion filled the brim with delicious sushi and expensive alcohol &mdash; we&rsquo;re not letting you turn this down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting out of this, there&rsquo;s no point in trying&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You grunts lowly. Marlee shrugs, it&rsquo;s true. Trotting around the corner into the hallway leading to your small bedroom, you go to pack the rest of belongings for the extended stay. </p><p>M stays at the couch, clapping and all smiles. &ldquo;Pack something sexy, and the rest of your makeup!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t get me a cheese danish! My dress is skin tight, and I&rsquo;ll be bloated!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful, eat the food.&rdquo; Sitting down you place the paper bag into Marlee&rsquo;s lap, sitting the iced coffee&rsquo;s in the cup holders. Your hands are wet, a feeling you hate. The surface of both of the plastic cups, reacted to their concoctions, making them wet. You plop in the passenger seat.</p><p>&ldquo;This is why I love you,&rdquo; Marlee sing-songed.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, so.&rdquo; You start. &ldquo;Whos party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my cousin Rafe&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s rich, therefore kicks it with richies. He has a mansion up in The Hills. It&rsquo;s gonna be fun. Trust me.&rdquo; Marlee starts her small car and drives off, the slight sound of music playing from the Starbuck&rsquo;s speaker outside its building diminishing. It&rsquo;s a nice day, not too hot to the point where you need to activate the air in the little Toyota, but not too cold where you can&rsquo;t let the windows down either. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brung up a Rafe before,&rdquo; You pull out your little bag of necessities for a trip extended like so. There&rsquo;s nothing too special it&rsquo;s holding, just a bottle of nail polish, some makeup wipes, and a portable charger. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s my fave cousin. Aged 24 so not too much of a gap between us. I haven&rsquo;t seen him in forever, I miss him muchly.&rdquo; Marlee says. You show the bottle to the black nail polish, before twisting it open. Using a folder from Marlee&rsquo;s glove compartment, you begin carefully painted your nails, efficiently coating layers. </p><p>Your nostrils flare, &ldquo;I miss my family too&hellip;&rdquo; Biting your lip quite intensely, you re- think the two words that contemplating your brain, not excited for it to ruin the mood, because it will. Seeing his name notificate your phone earlier was the worst case scenario. </p><p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t deserve the world I gave him&hellip;&rdquo; You say. Marlee merges onto the highway, glancing quickly at you, seeing you&rsquo;ve stopped painting to leant back against the leather of the chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Uh. What? Elaborate, please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brock texted.&rdquo; Silence. </p><p>&ldquo;Lovely&hellip;&rdquo; Marlee consoled. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; it threw me off. That&rsquo;s why I was being a bitch &mdash; I know we hate bitches. Sorry about that.&rdquo; You breathe with ease, chuckling lightly. Marlee&rsquo;s relieved Brock doesn&rsquo;t scare you like he use to, since you have the audacity to crack jokes and all, but her tongue is still fairly dry. Brock wasn&rsquo;t good to you; you both aren&rsquo;t blind to that fact. </p><p>&ldquo;No need to apologize. What did he say?&rdquo; Marlee&rsquo;s time was urgent as she gripped the steering wheel causing her knuckles to whiten. The hot pink polish on her nails grew more prominent because of it. </p><p>You turned. &ldquo;He missed me.&rdquo; &nbsp;The response was simple and short, but complete. &ldquo;And I panicked, so I ignored him. And that was that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve you. Just like you said &mdash; he didn&rsquo;t deserve the world you gave him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. He didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m excited for the party now, though,&rdquo;</p><p>You say, blowing on your thumb. &ldquo;And maybe that fuck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;BIIIITCH!&rdquo; Marlee nudges you. &ldquo;Maybe you can find a hot CEO or something.&rdquo; The girls laugh. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that rich?&rdquo; You ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Rafe is THAT rich.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s gonna try to get with you the minute he sees you, he&rsquo;s always been that way. I won&rsquo;t let him though, so, don&rsquo;t mind some cringey pickup lines if he&rsquo;s bold to try them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo; You abides, nodding. </p><p>&bull;</p><p>The mansion is definitely a mansion. Using the code Rafe texted Marlee with just 30 more minutes to go of the drive, the girls emerged in the subdivision, with awe written across their faces.</p><p>&ldquo;What do these people do?&rdquo; You had asked, completely flabbergasted. Marlee giggled, she shoulders bouncing with every breath released. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m serious! Because I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m in college right now if I can&rsquo;t have THIS when I get out.&rdquo; You wail your arms around, referring to the lavish cars in people&rsquo;s driveways, the fresh, plush grass paving their yards. It&rsquo;s almost like you can smell the wealth lingering in the air. </p><p>&ldquo;I think this is the one,&rdquo; Marlee mutters. She activates the turning signal, turning into one of the nicest homes on the block. Several trucks whether it be a G Wagon, a Jeep, or Range Rover chill to the side of the driveway, a parking lot type thing going on. They&rsquo;re all elaborate colors like lime green or a bright orange, and each license plate reads &lsquo;Styles&rsquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hotter in the Hidden Hills, most definitely. Your sweatshirt had to come off as soon as you guys hit the Calabasas welcoming sign. And from what it seems, it&rsquo;s only going to get hotter.</p><p>Taking a wild guess you&rsquo;re sure this is Rafe, as Marlee jumps out of the car to run into the arms of the man walking outside. His skill is tan, and his body is lean. He looks intimidating, but that&rsquo;s to be expected with wealth trailing behind you. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, how are you?&rdquo; He says, accepting Marlee&rsquo;s hug. He seems nice, you think. Standing awkwardly a few feet away from the reunited family members, you giving them all the time they need to rekindle, patiently waiting as you hug your midsection.</p><p>&ldquo;This is my best friend, Y/N.&rdquo; Marlee gestures toward Rafe, waving her over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hi, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you!&rdquo; You reaches your hand out, and Rafe gives a closed mouth smile, accepting it.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet you, I hope both of you girls have a lot of fun tonight &mdash; though I&rsquo;d just invite ya, having not seen ya in awhile.&rdquo; Rafe sideyes you, his tongue peeking out of his lip slightly. Oh, fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t my house,&rdquo; He falters. Oh.</p><p>&ldquo;But, if you go upstairs, and make your way down the hallway and around the corner to the left, you can choose any of those rooms to claim for the night. The party starts at 9, and doesn&rsquo;t end until people start leaving which isn&rsquo;t until like 3am. I&rsquo;ll be out back by the pool, have fun.&rdquo; And with that, he starts for the perimeter of the house, going out back. Okay.</p><p>&bull;</p><p>&ldquo;Biiitch we need to cut it out!&rdquo; Marlee&rsquo;s whispers, but doesn&rsquo;t as she giggles getting too much.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you need to!&rdquo; You exclaim, looking around your chosen room. You guys have ran around every inch and of the home you could find on the main and second floor, but not opening doors for the sake of the home owner. The ones that were open though, you didn&rsquo;t mind taking a peek in. In all, you came across a pool room, a fitness room, an arcade, and a theater along with some bland rooms that simply had nothing occupying them &mdash;maybe a chair, or neglected desk. Eventually, ya&rsquo;ll did follow Rafes directions in actually claiming a bedroom. Like little giddy girls squealing over Zach Efron at a 6th grade sleepover, you freaked about this too, cherishing the &lsquo;luxury life&rsquo; &mdash; and just having a little fun, for a tiny bit.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, open the makeup cases and put them on the counter.&rdquo; Marlee said. You did so, turning on the lights to the connected bathroom. After, grabbing you and M&rsquo;s bags, you found the closet to sit the clothes for the time being in. </p><p>Suits.</p><p>Lots of suits.</p><p>From purple, to pink, from navy blue, to red. From sparkles to plaid, from suede, to velvet.</p><p>So much color - so much texture. So many to choose from. Being impulsive, like you are you shut the door. That closet was off limits in your mind, not welcomed for newcomers. Each and every one of those suits looked so expensive &mdash; no doubt they could fund the average family for 6 months.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo; Marlee&rsquo;s eyes are questioning as she sits up right in on the bed. </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah.&rdquo; You blurt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine! Let&rsquo;s ugh, let&rsquo;s do your hair.&rdquo; You turn away from M for a moment, scolding yourself with a roll of your eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Marlee shrugs hopping off of the bed. She thought absolutely nothing of anything, and that&rsquo;s what you loved about your friend most &mdash; she wasn&rsquo;t a poker, nor a proder for information.</p><p>The camera flashed, and the girls looked back at the photo.</p><p>&ldquo;We look HELLA cute!&rdquo; You exclaim, instantly saving the photo before adding it to your story. You wore a black two piece outfit, the shirt cropped, along with the skirt, short and tight. The heels you decided on were a nice velvet tan, straps that accompanying your calves as they tied up your legs. Marlee&rsquo;s dress was a pretty blue color, with some simple black heels.</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot seem to find&hellip;&rdquo; Marlee mumbled as she walked away. She was obviously talking to herself, so you went and applied another coat of sheer lipgloss for good measure. As the smooth substance rounded your lips, Marlee perked. </p><p>&ldquo;Did you see this earlier?&rdquo;</p><p>You look to Marlee, and she hold a suit jacket in her hand. It was a maroon-ish color, jewel complementing the start of the sleeves.</p><p>&ldquo;Put it down!&rdquo; You &nbsp;grabbed the jacket from her, finding the assumed the matching pants for it, and hanging it up again in the closet. &ldquo;Do you know how much these probably are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, no shit. It&rsquo;s says Gucci on the inside.&rdquo;</p><p>You slapped her arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch then, crazy!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Look how cool they are, though!&rdquo; Marlee boggled. She walks further into the closet, randomly grabbing another suit jacket. &ldquo;Oooooohh this one&rsquo;s nice!&rdquo; She admires the clothing, twisting the hanger back and forth between her fingers to get a glimpse in all directions.</p><p>It was pretty gorgeous. It&rsquo;s a baby pink shade, and velvet textured. From what it looked like, it had woven frog designs, and crystal embroidery. It was so, so pretty. A fixed look was on your face, as you pouted your head hanging at a limp. </p><p>&ldquo;Wear it.&rdquo; Marlee said &mdash; no. It wasn&rsquo;t a statement, let alone a question. More of a command.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you crazy?! No! I-it&rsquo;s not mine!&rdquo; Marlee drags your name out as you decline.</p><p>&ldquo;Bro, this isn&rsquo;t Rafe&rsquo;s house. He probably rented it for the night of something, HE doesn&rsquo;t even know who this belongs&mdash;&ldquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that! The person could be at this party!&rdquo;</p><p>Marlee scoffs, &ldquo;I doubt it.&rdquo; It would look so good with your outfit! Just hold it!&rdquo;</p><p>You purse your lips, snatching the jacket from Marlee, taking a look. It was pretty, and you did like the idea of maybe rocking it, but it wasn&rsquo;t yours &mdash; you would never.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pure gem right there &mdash; try it on, at least,&rdquo; Marlee insists.</p><p>You grunt, before mumbling freely, enough for M to hear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one for making bad decisions.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;NO ONE IS HERE BUT US, WOMEN.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. Gosh.&rdquo; Your dainty fingers drop the hanger from the jacket, slipping it on. Walking to the mirror in the bathroom with Marlee on your tracks, you feel up the jacket, the soft material lovely under the pads of your fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;quite cute.&rdquo; Your friend nods with her arms crossed. You look at her wary through the reflection of the large mirror.</p><p>&ldquo;It is&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just wear it. You&rsquo;re not messy. You&rsquo;re not incapable. It&rsquo;s just a few hours.&rdquo; Staying silent, you look down at the tiled floor. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; You perks your chin, a little hum omitting from the back of your dry throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to get you a fuck.&rdquo; </p><p>Marlee bursts at the seams, laughing hysterically at her own joke.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fuh-nny.&rdquo; Y/N snickers in between breathes, looking at the jacket once more.</p><p> &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear it?&rdquo; Marlee asks. She&rsquo;s like a hyper child, her mood so happy for you to wear a piece of clothing. </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess. It&rsquo;s really pretty&hellip; but I&rsquo;m also trusting your word with all my fate that this guy isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Psh talk about embarrassing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Marlee checks her phone, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten. Let&rsquo;s head down.&rdquo;</p><p>&bull;</p><p>You hated yourself for not bringing Advil.</p><p>With the loud music, crazed screaming matches between people, and the alcoholic beverages, you were done for fairly quickly. It wasn&rsquo;t necessary to go back upstairs though, as people were everywhere, getting into everything. </p><p>Marlee and you chilled poolside, the water forming an iridescent glow. Twilight hours were long gone, as the sun was setting when y&rsquo;all first arrived. The only thing providing light now we&rsquo;re lanterns which were nice and dimmed, making everything pretty with a glow. </p><p>You&rsquo;d met a few people, one of them being a gal named Evie. She was purple haired, her eyes being a nice blue shade. She&rsquo;s very &lsquo;out there&rsquo;, making it fun to talk and dance with her &mdash; that was until she announced she was going to get more alcohol and never came back. It wasn&rsquo;t too surprising as her and another guest Nelly hit if off nice. The two women were most definitely somewhere hooking up, but you just hoped they&rsquo;d come down again after &mdash; they were beyond friendly, and really fun to be around. </p><p>&ldquo;I still really want those Jell-O shots regardless,&rdquo; Marlee says, a cocktail in one hand.</p><p>&ldquo;I can go get them, just stay here so I won&rsquo;t lose ya.&rdquo; She nods, pulling out her phone, probably about to capture another moment of this party for social media, as her name is Marlee. You will admit, the party is fun, and nicely decorated with bearable music playing through the speakers. Everyone was nice, and you hadn&rsquo;t seen anything too manic yet; more people were flooding in though, meaning more food and alcohol was too, and all types of personalities so you never know. The only bothering thing was the ache in your temples, clouding your brain with worried thought more than the drinks. You weren&rsquo;t wasted, not even a little bit tipsy, but you wouldn&rsquo;t mad if you got there. </p><p>A Tiki Bar was down farther down the lawn, causing you to have to walk on the plush grass. Plush or not, grass is grass, and you weren&rsquo;t ready for grass stains on your heels. They were new, (and expensive) and keeping them nice wasn&rsquo;t mandatory. But you shook off the frustration, and throbbing headache for the sake of having fun. </p><p>&ldquo;What do ya need?&rdquo; A long haired blondie that looked as if he surfed the Malibu waves for a living asked. You giggled a bit, as he shimmied with a bright smile, eyebrows prying for an answer. </p><p>You has to raise your voice over the music, &ldquo;Ugh, I just need some Jell-O shots!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dank!&rdquo; He said going to the mini fridge. Yeah, definitely a surfer, if not just an illiterate goof. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you reckon some plain vodka shots instead? We&rsquo;re all out.&rdquo; He replies. </p><p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re nasty plain. I&rsquo;ll just go inside and find some, thanks, though!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;See ya later! Aye, that jacket&rsquo;s pretty gnarly by the way.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; You say more dumbfounded than anything. You can&rsquo;t resist. &ldquo;Hey, do you surf?&rdquo; </p><p>His face lit up. &ldquo;I sure dooooo!&rdquo; He gushes, carrying the vowel. You giggle &mdash; had to know. </p><p>It was refreshing talking to a dude that just wanted to talk, and wasn&rsquo;t desperate for your vagina. Honestly, you did want a fuck to relieve stress and sexual tension, but not with a dude that was basically belting with horny hormones. You reminded yourself this wasn&rsquo;t the college party you were use to, didn&rsquo;t know everyone. That fuck that was craved was unfortunately out the window. Maybe next time. </p><p>The air wasn&rsquo;t cool anymore inside the house, as it was taken over by several partiers; more in here than outside. It was a stuffy atmosphere. Dancing caused sweat, and with being in such proximity of a fellow person, it can accommodate a lot of it. Closing the slide door, you maneuvered around the dancing bodies and make out sessions, trying to recall where the kitchen was. </p><p><i>Right? Yeah, go right. </i></p><p><i>Um, down this hall, then left. </i></p><p><i>Fuck no, not left! Dammit, Y/N.</i></p><p><i>Okay, right.</i></p><p><i>NOW left. </i></p><p><i>Okay okay, here we are.</i></p><p>The kitchens fairly empty and clean but to be honest, everything is on this side of the house. All of the sitting areas look pristine and untouched just like they were before. </p><p><i>What if they have Advil somewhere in here? </i></p><p>You can keep Advil in the kitchen&hellip; right? You don&rsquo;t know. You at least needed some ice, badly, to numb the pounding of your head for 5 minutes before going back out.</p><p>First you open the fridge for good measure, and what do you know, Jell-O shots and more cooled foods with-hold in it. </p><p><i>Now that ice. </i></p><p>Opening cabinets one by one, you look for some type of cups to dispense the ice cubes in. You do find the cups, some glasses reading &lsquo;Styles&rsquo; monogrammed on the front.</p><p><i>What&rsquo;s with this dude? </i></p><p>&ldquo;Nice jacket.&rdquo; </p><p>A raspy voice calls from behind you, and you freeze. Your heels turn to see a lean man leaning on the archway to the kitchen. His arms are crossed, an amused smirk playing his lips &mdash; the lips that are really pink. He&rsquo;s got on a some black jeans, and a casual yellow button up. All in all, he&rsquo;s cute. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; He reveals. </p><p><i>Fuck.</i></p><p>You laugh dryly, not understanding how in world you could be so stupid and follow through with Marlee&rsquo;s dumb idea. Now you&rsquo;re here, in the most awkward predicament. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s not what it looks like &mdash; you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;cool, s&rsquo;cool,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I quite like you in it,&rdquo; He walks over, observing you closely in the jacket every which way, until he&rsquo;s in front of you, towering over. &ldquo;You look hot. It fits you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T-thanks.&rdquo; You can only imagine how stupid you look right now, and you tell yourself to pull it together; it&rsquo;s failing miserably. A jittery mess you are, only thinking &nbsp;about the vibrant color of his eyes, and the little dimple that peaks when he smiles.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;What were ya lookin&rsquo; for?&rdquo; He gestures toward all of the open cabinets, chuckling a bit. </p><p>&ldquo;Ice. Have a headache.&rdquo; She admits quietly. </p><p>&ldquo;No medication?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t bother looking for any.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you bothered rummaging through my closet?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not serious, not mad, more so happy as he keeps chuckling.</p><p>&ldquo;Rafe told us just to pick a room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That room is off limits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it seems after I already claimed it.&rdquo;</p><p>He flashes another starboy smile,his arms crossing nonchalantly. &ldquo;I like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, do you have Advil? Aspirin? Anything?&rdquo; You hopes to change the subject, tension getting the best of you.</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; He reaches out, his palm asking permission to take yours. You didn&rsquo;t know what was worse, the fact that you&rsquo;re blushing has gotten wayyy out of hand from his face, or the fact that you&rsquo;re still in his Gucci jacket he called you hot in. </p><p>Either way, you took his hand because why the fuck wouldn&rsquo;t you. </p><p>His stride is so quick she has to damn there run with him to keep up. He didn&rsquo;t seem to really care too much about the swarm of people, as they pass them no problem and make their way upstairs. It&rsquo;s darker in the hallway, and a toilet flushes from behind the bathroom door. There&rsquo;s some foams cups littered up and down the corridor, a random bottle of Hennessy lying upon the hardwood floors. </p><p>Your mouth waters in such way, admiring the random ink on him. You enjoy the spontaneous look of his tattoos, like how there&rsquo;s a locket chillin above the arrow, or a naked mermaid rounding his forearm; you&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s your favorite. </p><p>Wait. </p><p><i>What&rsquo;s his name? </i></p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; He opens the door to his bedroom, it being obvious with how big and dominant it is. You doesn&rsquo;t have to ask, it&rsquo;s his house they&rsquo;re in. The room has quite a plain look, but you doesn&rsquo;t see the harm. With white sheets rounding the King sized bed, and a fur rug centering the room, it&rsquo;s a nice look. </p><p>You like that, too. </p><p>&ldquo;Harry. Harry Styles. Yours?&rdquo; Their hands are detached now as he close the door and makes his way to the more illuminated crevice of his room, his bathroom. You tell him your name, and he nods. </p><p>Your eyebrows quirk as you wonder why this bathroom could literally fit your whole entire room in it, and then some. &ldquo;Makes since.&rdquo; You respond, still on the top of names. </p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Harry rummages through a drawer, prying little things out like neglected bobby pins and toothbrush protectors. </p><p>&ldquo;Anything you can put &lsquo;Styles&rsquo; on, you do.&rdquo; Absentmindedly, you picks up his soap on the sink, smell it, and then lay it down again. </p><p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;re observant.&rdquo; Harry stands from his crouching position, after finally finding some pain relievers. There&rsquo;s a small stack of disposable mouthwash cups and Harry fills one with water to hand to you. He can&rsquo;t help watching your every move as you toss both small pink tablets into your mouth and gulp down the water. He likes how you hold the cup, your little pinky sticking up as if it&rsquo;s tea. He also likes how you take notice of his observing and asks him what his problem is right after, too. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just really pretty, s&rsquo;all.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Thanks&hellip; again.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I enjoy seeing you blush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I enjoy compliments, so keep them coming.&rdquo; You joke. He shrugs, that&rsquo;s not challenging. </p><p>&ldquo;I like your attitude, you don&rsquo;t shy away from a comeback,&rdquo; You hum, and slowly nodding your head. &ldquo;I like how my Gucci fits you, and how the back hem of it sits right above your bum&hellip; gives the perfect view of it. S&rsquo;pretty nice.&rdquo; His slick tone mixed with his accent is heaven in a bottle. </p><p>You take a few steps closer to Harry, biting your lip. His eyes trail up and down your figure once, before completing the eye contact you share &mdash; it&rsquo;s like a flame is ignited.</p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;gonna make a move first, or do I have to?&rdquo; His teases, hands coming up in a surrender way, that dimple showing once again. </p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t have to ask me twice. </i></p><p>His are soft and cool against your warm ones, and the feeling sends shivers down your spine. His hands grip your hips, and soon, it&rsquo;s a hot make out session as your tongues say hello to one another, and tangle. </p><p>You&rsquo;re pulling his hair at the nape of his neck, it&rsquo;s soft between your fingertips - you enjoys the feeling, and even wonder if it&rsquo;s the appropriate time to ask him what products he uses; nevermind that. He slides his hands down to grip the curve of her bum, as you get more aggressive with his strands. You take the risk of biting his lip harshly, but to soothe the pain, you suck on it, one hand cradling his jawline. The kiss breaks with a pop sound, both of them catching their absent breathes. </p><p>His pupils are dilated. &ldquo;Here, or my penthouse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have two houses?&rdquo; You question. To keep him in your proximity, you tug at his collar. </p><p>&ldquo;Four. Now which one?&rdquo; </p><p>He&rsquo;s desperate; you&rsquo;re feeding off of it.</p><p>You think for a few, leaning your head against Harry&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s fidgety, as his eyelids blink rapidly. The color surprises you everytime he opens them again. </p><p>&ldquo;To save you a drive, cause I know you&rsquo;re about to burst,&rdquo; You look to his crotch, jeans tightened around his manhood. &ldquo;We can stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re toxic.&rdquo; He cradles your jaw, tongues tangling once more, and you relish in the moment because it&rsquo;s just so nice. His right hand reaches to switch the bathroom light off before tapping your plump bum, signaling to &lsquo;jump&rsquo;. Wrapping your legs around his waist, and he effortlessly walks over to the foot of his bed. The bedroom isn&rsquo;t as bright, as the two bedside lamps are only on. It&rsquo;s a more comfortable feeling for you &mdash; the perfect lighting for two bodies to explore one another&rsquo;s. Marlee is forgotten and so are those Jell-O shots.</p><p>Harry releases you to stand on feet, and you have been doing that for awhile, but for some reason it&rsquo;s more difficult now. Your legs feel like some Jell-O shots, dazed by the events that are occurring so quickly. </p><p>You&rsquo;re putty in his hands. </p><p>Harry goes to lock the door quickly. After he comes back to see a very giggly and eager you, connecting your lips once more. </p><p><i>God, she&rsquo;s cute</i>, He thinks. </p><p>With a few tugs, you break the buttons of his shirt from the seams, the little pebble shaped things falling to the floor. With an eager giggling you, and a horny Harold,</p><p>it combines into this moment of absolute chaos. His stomach tattoos are out of this world, who would&rsquo;ve &nbsp;thought to get a butterfly in the middle of their midsection and it look so good? You were amazed, the details of every single one, so intricate, so pretty, and so attractive. </p><p>The left side of your neck is Harry&rsquo;s new blank canvas, as he nips where he wants. He takes to accountability to find your sweet spot as his rubs up and down your sides, his big hands exploring your closed torso. His wet kisses travel throughout, and you whimper when he finds your spot, that spot that makes you weak in the knees. </p><p>&ldquo;Bingo,&rdquo; He mutters. </p><p>&ldquo;Bastard.&rdquo; You say back.</p><p>There, in the crevice of your jawline by your ear, he suctions his lips, sucking to break the skin and hopefully in the end, have a purple and pink colored hickey. Your eyes roll back, and you grip what&rsquo;s left of Harry shirt for dear life. You feel how hard he&rsquo;s breathing, how much he&rsquo;s sucking, and it&rsquo;s phenomenal. These sensations are new again, as you got so caught up in college, unable to experience this sooner. Your mind is refreshed with the feelings and emotion you feel during this type of thing, your underwear dampening in the blink of an eye. </p><p>You take the time to pull his jacket off, carelessly tossing it behind you on the bed as Harry slips off his shirt completely. With raising your arms up, Harry gets the memo you want to be topless &mdash; what he doesn&rsquo;t know is in order to make this top look good, you couldn&rsquo;t wear a bra. He fumbles with the material, finally gripping to pulling it over you head. Your breasts spring free of any congestion and the look on Harry&rsquo;s face is platinum. He like a thirsty dog, looking at his owner desperately as they fill his water bowl. He attacks your sternum area, both hands fiddling with the perky nipples of yours. You bite your lip, the feeling of his wet lips everywhere other than your face unfamiliar, but incredible. </p><p>His tongue is warm, his lips are soft, and boy does he know how to use them. His lips wrap around one of your nipples, and a fatal whimper proceeds to fall from your mouth as you grip onto his shoulders. He detaches just for a second to lay you down on your back, it colliding with the soft mattress. Harry&rsquo;s body is in between your thighs as he still takes the time to assault your chest, and you don&rsquo;t mind. You desperately run your fingers through his hair as he switches nipples, a moan pervading from the back of your throat. He loves the feeling of you, the sound of you, everything &mdash; he can only take so much of your sweet and soft moans before he&rsquo;s fingering around your skirt to pull off. </p><p>You nod your head, lifting your hips slightly to help him remove the material. He&rsquo;s standing now, towering over you, sure he can now say he&rsquo;s laid eyes on a real life angel. You&rsquo;re beautiful. Your lips are plumper and a shade darker from 20 minutes ago, your hair sprawled out on the mattress rounding your head like a crown upon the silk sheets. </p><p>He comes close to you one more time, placing a smooch to your navel, forehead, nose, then lips. You look to possibly deepen the kiss, but it&rsquo;s obvious Harry&rsquo;s looking to taste more things &mdash; and not your tongue at the moment. He looks at you with reassurance to naked you completely, which you abide in with a small, &lsquo;Please.&rsquo; H does &nbsp;takes time to rid you of the restriction, the simple black thong discarded somewhere in the room. </p><p>With an agonizing pace that makes you want to run yourself into a brick wall, Harry slowly kneels down on his knees. His forearms hook both of your thighs in the process, pulling them over his toned shoulders. Your chest rises, frustrated of his teasing ways as he goes closer to your youth, huffing long, hot, breathes onto it. You guys hold eye contact for a few seconds as he does this, causing you to plead. </p><p>&ldquo;Ha&mdash;<i>oh</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>The sentence is left pathetically broken up, his warm tongue lapping up and down your pussy repeatedly. </p><p>&ldquo;Wet as fuck,&rdquo; He baits.</p><p>He&rsquo;s anxious, you taste delicious over his tongue, he can&rsquo;t help a little grunt of pleasure. You take hold of his mops of curls, at this period still trying to hold in your moans. You&rsquo;re writhing though, a mess already as your breathing toughens and your hair becoming a bit more frizzy. Your left hand reaches for the Gucci jacket discarded earlier. You hold it close to your chest, the other hand guiding Harry&rsquo;s head where you want him most; your clit. </p><p>He does follow your liking, applying pressure to the aroused bud with his warm, wet tongue. Your taste is ambrosial, somethings he&rsquo;s never tasted before &mdash; maybe you&rsquo;re a combination of honey &mdash; maybe something of citrus &mdash; or just simply you. Voluntarily lifting your legs up higher, with thighs now facing toward the ceiling now, Harry encourages your movements gripping them to stay there. He laps your dripping flower a few more times, liking the pretty moan that erupts from her lips each time he does so. </p><p>&ldquo;Pretty little thing you are. Could assume you tasted good, but not how you do &mdash; delicious.&rdquo; Harry&rsquo;s voice is raspy and low. You can&rsquo;t bare to hold back anymore, letting a loud mom rip through you like a bulldozer, the exhilaration of activities encouraging the act. </p><p>He sees you biting onto the Gucci wear, trying to silence yourself, but he&rsquo;s not having it. He&rsquo;s craving that noise of yours, the sounds that harden his dick. He stretches his arm, grabbing the Gucci and throwing it behind him. </p><p>&ldquo;Wanna hear you,&rdquo; He instructs. &ldquo;&lsquo;Specially for this.&rdquo; </p><p>He sinks two fingers in you, a gargled sound erupting from you, a large gasp coming right after. The sounds you make are intangible to control, but neither of you mind &mdash; Harry&rsquo;s living now, hearing your reaction to his pleasure. He speeds up, your moans speed up, he slows down, you do as well. You feel good better than you have in awhile, and you assume you&rsquo;re just getting started. He harshly sucks on your clit some more, pumping his digits in and out at a faster pace. Harry &nbsp;feels his jeans restraining more than ever, your taste, your moans, and the pulling of his hair too much. He takes his fingers out, a sad whimper coming from the beaut in front of him. He takes one finger at a time, suckling the juices - your juices, off of them, groaning at the taste; it&rsquo;s more prominent. </p><p>He&rsquo;s gotta have you. </p><p>Now. </p><p>&ldquo;Help me out, love.&rdquo; He groans as he fumbles with his jeans. You without hesitation sit up, taking over the task of unbuckling everything. A huge amount of tension is liberated from his prick, only his Calvin&rsquo;s covering it. You&rsquo;re ready for the thing, ready to cum already with him inside of you. You&rsquo;ve never desired anything more for awhile, as your life&rsquo;s been pretty routined lately. </p><p>&ldquo;I am on the pill, and I&rsquo;m clean.&rdquo; You blurt. You want Harry real and raw, and will be damned if a condom stands in the way of that. After all, you really are on the pill and clean of any infections or diseases - you can only imagine Harry&rsquo;s the same. </p><p>He nods frantically, pupils dilated, the exotic color of his eyes almost gone as only a little green rounds the black. Pulling down his briefs, Harry&rsquo;s penis slaps his stomach before balancing out. He&rsquo;s big and swollen, Harry hissing as he kneels down a bit, lining himself with you. He&rsquo;s sensitive, pre cum drooling out of his tips nastily while he pumps himself. Sitting up on your shoulders, you observe his motion is such way to make Harry think you&rsquo;re just a desperate as he is. With eyes wild, slightly bloodshot, piercing into his own. </p><p>&ldquo;Lay back, doll.&rdquo; He orders. Doing so, you reach for his shoulders, wanting a sweet kiss before starting. He give you it, laying on top on you with a forearm by your head. <i>He&rsquo;s big,</i> you think - <i>but nothing I can&rsquo;t handle. </i></p><p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo; His apprehension gets the best of him, and even though he knows you&rsquo;re okay, he can&rsquo;t help to ask. </p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M good Harry, I&rsquo;m good. Just take me,&rdquo; You plead. He nods, hair coming down over his face and you move it off his forehead, holding one hand there. </p><p>He takes no more stalling time, and slowly eases into you. The longful moan you let out is like angels singing. You don&rsquo;t necessarily remember the feeling of the last time you had sex, but you know for sure you didn&rsquo;t feel this full &mdash; you never have. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuuuck - Harry, oh my god.&rdquo; You drag. You grip his bicep, beckoning him to start moving. </p><p>&ldquo;Ata, girl &mdash; fuck, y-you&rsquo;re tight.&rdquo; Harry seizes biting his lip as he gradually picks up speed. You feel him in your tummy, and your wetness can be heard from a mile away as your skin slaps repeatedly. You&rsquo;re thriving, a mount of tingles already building up inside you. Harry&rsquo;s pubic hair rushes up and down your clit as he moves, increasing the pressure more. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, you like that baby?&rdquo; You whine a &lsquo;yeah&rsquo; the weakness in your voice heard as your focused on the way he thrusts, fast movements jolting your body. Harry&rsquo;s forehead has beads of sweat forming as you pull him down for a kiss. Your breath is hot against one another&rsquo;s, his tongue running over your bottom lip, asking for permission inside. With everything going on as it is, you&rsquo;re not ready when Harry takes it into his hands to deliver you a hard, deep thrust, causing you to squeal and break contact between mouths. </p><p>You grit at your teeth. &ldquo;Fuck, Har, I need &mdash; I need&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do ya need?&rdquo; He cuts you off. His thrusting hasn&rsquo;t slowed at all, his breathe heavy as he can&rsquo;t control himself. You&rsquo;re so fucking tight, so fucking pretty underneath him. </p><p>&ldquo;Ride you &mdash; I wanna ride you.&rdquo; You choke.</p><p>Harry wastes no time to turn you two over. He moves up some more on the bed, and you straddle above his hips immediately as you press one hand down on his chest, and use the other to aline yourself with his cock. With your eyes on each other, you sink down, and gasp omitting from both parties. Harry guides you &nbsp;firmly with his hands on your hips, slamming you down harder than you ever could on your own. His eyes are focused on the way your breasts are bouncing as y&rsquo;all continue, you open handedly kneading them to put on a show.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice and wet and tight for me, doll. Couldn&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; He pauses do gulp, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything better.&rdquo; He finishes. You can see the vein prominent in his neck, his abs flexing underneath you. You continuously bounce of harder with the help of him, the feeling of getting filled to the brim by his huge cock never expiring. </p><p>You can feel your orgasm creeping up on you, and Harry certainly does too, as he grunts here and there when you tighten around him.</p><p>&ldquo;H-harry, shit! Harry,&rdquo; You moan.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, baby. C&rsquo;mon, say it. Know you want to.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re sweating now, pulsing around his cock. You hands plop back on his chest, toes curling at the bubbling sensation growing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it until you tell me, kitten.&rdquo; He orders. </p><p><i>Fuck,</i> you think.<i> He knows. </i></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna &mdash; Harry, I&rsquo;m gonna cum so hard.&rdquo; You admit through gasps of breath. Harry&rsquo;s thumb presses to your clit, rubbing harsh figure eights into the little bud causing you to mewl out loud. </p><p>He smacks your ass with his other hand, and that only coaches you to go faster. &ldquo;S&rsquo;that the case? You can cum, baby. Cum nice and hard on my cock.&rdquo; He coaxes, flicking your clit with his pointer finger. </p><p>That&rsquo;s your green light, and Harry only speeds up the process by planting his feet on the mattress and thrusting up into you; the bubble in your lower stomach is bursted completely, white blotches forming, prohibiting your eyesight. Not that it mattered as you closed your eyes, collapsing on top of Harry. His skin is sticky, and his hands are clammy as he grabs your ass, to give it a few more thrusts up his dick. You&rsquo;re riding out your orgasm this way, euphoria washing over you as you moan into his ear tiredly.</p><p>He turns to kiss your temple, your head hidden in the crook of his neck. Soon, he&rsquo;s cumming too, deep moans of pleasure sounding. You glide your hands up and down his chest, kissing him in random spots. </p><p>You both take the time to calm, maybe after five minutes of you running your nails up and down his scalp, and him tracing miscellaneous circles around your back, he breaks the silence. </p><p>&ldquo;You good, baby?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; You answer contently. &ldquo;Never been better.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, that&rsquo;s a stretch,&rdquo; Harry insists. He looks down at you smiling like a goof, you fluffing his hair. </p><p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; You protest. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t has this much fun in awhile&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Glad you enjoyed yourself. Can&rsquo;t wait to have ya like this again in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who said this was gonna happen again?&rdquo; You joke, eyebrows quirking. He sighs. </p><p>With a swift motion, you&rsquo;re below him once again as he relaxes between your thighs. </p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; He says. &ldquo;I like ya a lot, and you&rsquo;re not going anywhere.&rdquo; With a quick kiss to your lips, you bop his nose.</p><p>You sarcastically sigh, caressing his cheek, &ldquo;I suppose we can do this again&hellip;&rdquo; He&rsquo;s kissing your sternum, pecking the cushion of your breasts. </p><p>&ldquo;Give it a round two?&rdquo; He asks, looking up at you. </p><p>&ldquo;After I find my friend.&rdquo; You say, your pointer finger analyzing you statement. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad friend!&rdquo; Harry laughs, never knowing in the first place you were here with another person. You laugh along with him, realizing you really are. You left her, for a good hour now. </p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s okay, she&rsquo;s not a pariah &mdash; meets new pals pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ugh, my vagina&rsquo;s throbbing&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And my penis is pulsing, what&rsquo;s your point?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my fucking&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N! I hear your voice,&rdquo; Marlee bangs on the door a few times, startling you and H. &ldquo;You got that fuck!&rdquo; From the sound of it, she&rsquo;s utterly wasted, her words slurring. &ldquo;Hip hip hurray!&rdquo; She&rsquo;s yells, banging on the door once more. </p><p>Harry&rsquo;s laughing, his face scrunched on your chest. &ldquo;I like her!&rdquo; </p><p><b>a/n: Soooo that was my first smut.
