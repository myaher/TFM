                "content": "<p><h1>Women of GoT S8 Ep3</h1><p>Let start with my favorite: Sansa</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>Ok first off she is not weak! She wanted to stay up on the battlements with Arya but knew that she would just be a liability up there so she left. I think she was talking to herself just as much as she was talking to Tyrion when she said they needed to look the truth in the face, and the truth is they are not great soldiers they are great thinkers. However she shows her courage when she is willing to fight in the crypts (I have never been so mad at anything as much as I am about the fact that they cut the scene where she killed whites!!!) This moment above was one of my favorites of the episode because is shows their fear, their respect for eachother, and that they are gaining streangth from eachother. They are both hiding because of fear and individually they might have stayed hidden but they realize together that they are strong and brave and that they need to do something and they do. Also I never shipped them before but seriously Sophie Turner has chemistry with everything she comes in contact with &#128525;&#129392;</p><p>Daenerys</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"1\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>I want to preface this section by saying that she is not my favorite character. Whis that said I think that the reason people think she was useless is because they expected to much from her. The people who expected her to single handedly defeat the NK were not being practical because besides having dragons she is not really that useful in battle, and we knew from last episode that dragon fire would probably not work because Bran was all like &#129335;&zwj;&#9794;&#65039;. For those who complained that her picking up a sword and fighting was unrealistic and stupid, I would say it would have been if she picked up a weapon for the first time and was Arya level skilled but she was not. It is not impossible that the fear of death and adrenaline would give her the streangth and fortitude to pick up a sword and use it. Even in real life people d amazing things when their life or the lives of their loved ones are in danger (so for me this is compleatly practical). However that fact that between her and Jorah, they beat back an entire swarm of the dead, that gets a little more unbelievable.</p><p>Missandei </p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"2\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>She stood up for her queen, her friend, the person she believes the most in; this is not a surprise or anything to get <span class=\"npf_color_joey\">rieled </span>up about. It did surprise me that neither she or greyworm died and so I am expecting something from their story line (something other than seeing the breaches again). </p><p>Brienne </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/814275b44055d705867ce7cb1b82a3ad/tumblr_pqssiddCKh1v47938_400.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>How did she not die. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love her and I want her to be Sansa&rsquo;s Queens Guard, but her ark has ended. I thought the only way she would survive is if someone sacrificed themselves for her (like Tormund, Jamie, or Pod). There were sooooo many characters that I don&rsquo;t understand how they survived and she is just in the long list. If you are in the front lines and never get a break, I don&rsquo;t care how good you are at fighting one of them are going to die.
