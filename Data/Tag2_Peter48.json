As NSFW as it gets, you better sit down</p><p><a href=\"https://almostrealdudes.tumblr.com/post/184767296009\">PART 1</a></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>In a desperate need to catch a taxi, she literally threw herself in front of a car, urging it to stop. Getting an inviting gesture from the driver, she jumped inside on the passenger seat and spat out the address.</p><p>\u201cGo go go, please, I need to get there as fast as possible,\u201d she babbled, opening her chat with Peter and starting to type rapidly.</p><p>\u201cGeez, what\u2019s the hurry?\u201d the driver asked, turning his wheel and merging with the car flow.</p><p><i>oh my god</i></p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is in trouble,\u201d she said, shaking nervously.</p><p><i>oh my god peter im so sorry</i></p><p><i>im omw</i></p><p>\u201cHe needs me,\u201d she said quitter, finishing her last message.</p><p><i>please hang in there im coming</i></p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d said the driver, throwing a quick look at her, \u201cbut it\u2019s rush hour, lady. I\u2019ll try to get you there as fast as I can, but your boy chose the worst time to be in trouble. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. It\u2019s on me. I should\u2019ve known it was about to happen, but I completely forgot.\u201d Her leg was shaking in a nervous tick as she watched the road lights change from red to green, hoping they\u2019ll make it through the next one.</p><p>\u201cMy, what is it with your boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a\u2026 condition,\u201d her cheeks flushed red. She imagined Peter\u2019s possible state, all hot and bothered, unwillingly edging himself, desperate for human contact. For contact with her. She pressed her thighs closer together. The situation, although alarming, was extremely arousing at the same time.</p><p>\u201cA condition? Is it dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know\u2026 is it lethal?\u201d asked the driver nonchalantly, taking another turn.</p><p>\u201cOh god, no! God, I hope it\u2019s not!\u201d her eyes grew bigger as she let the frightful thoughts enter her mind. She heard her phone beep, notifying her of a new message, making her heart beat even faster than it already was. She opened the chat again.</p><p><i>please hurry</i></p><p><i>its bad</i></p><p>\u201cAh. See? I told you. Rush hour.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see a wall of red lights in front of her. All the cars were frozen in place, all the rows were stuck dead until the very end of the road, which was pretty far away. She pressed her lips tightly together. This won\u2019t do. It will take her forever to get home if she continues like this.</p><p>She had to run.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve got this from here.\u201d</p><p>She took out the money and slammed it onto the car dash, unbuckling her seatbelt and quickly getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHey! Careful, you punk!\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she could remotely hear her driver say before she took off. To say she ran fast would be a huge understatement. Never in her life has she run as fast as she was running now. Gladly, they managed to make some progress on the road, and the apartment was not as far away. Checking the time, she maneuvered through the crowd, getting gradually closer. When she could see her building at the end of the street, she picked up the pace as if seeing the finish line at a marathon. At the front door, she tried to dial the entrance code, making mistakes thrice, because her shaking fingers kept missing the right buttons. After hearing the buzz, she flew into the main hall and rushed up the stairs, getting the keys out of the bag in advance. Finally, at the apartment door, she started going through all the keys with her shaking fingers, struggling to find the right one. Mailbox, office, parent\u2019s house\u2026 there, the apartment key. She shoved it in and turned until a click, smashing the door open.</p><hr><p><br/>Peter couldn\u2019t move a muscle. All the energy was going from all the parts of his body straight into his cock, which was glowing from how red, swollen, and tense it was. Peter has never felt worse in his life: it was a feeling of constant, unflagging, ongoing edging. His body was in an insufferable pre-orgasmic state, and Peter\u2019s mind was going absolutely insane from all the hours of denied relief. He was crying, letting out desperate sobs, unable to take it anymore. His hand was fixated around his shaft, pumping it without pause for god knows how long, without any results.</p><p>When the door was thrown open, he thought he was hallucinating. But then, a strong, wild, dizzying smell filled the apartment, making Peter\u2019s body shudder in anticipation. It was perfume, sweat, and her natural scent, which made the veins on his length pulsate with renewed vigor. He moaned, inhaling every last bit of it, its hints stimulating every living inch of his body.</p><p>The state of him was heartbreaking. But god how extremely sexual it was: Peter\u2019s body, covered in sweat and precum, twirling and quivering in wrinkled sheets, his cock squeezed tightly in his hand, leaking from his hyperarousal. Her folds clenched at the view, leaking from the mere thought of his pulsating cock inside her.</p><p>And fuck did he feel it. Her presence in the room after hours of sexual solitude felt like a whole new world of sensations. He could smell her fluids slowly soaking her underwear, he could feel the heat coming from between her legs and it drove him absolutely crazy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d she said quietly, astounded.</p><p>\u201cPle-ease,\u201d he sobbed, \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I ca-an\u2019t, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Peter, I got you, I got you,\u201d she mumbled, quickly undressing completely and climbing onto the bed. She was afraid to touch him first, it could worsen the situation. So she loomed over his cock, positioning herself more comfortably. Peter could feel the time slow down as she was slowly lowering her head to his member. He could feel all of it: the heat coming from her parted lips, the wetness inside her mouth. His own mouth opened in anticipation, saliva dripping from the corners. And then, her lips covered his tip and Peter screamed. His hips immediately jerked up, desperate for her to take him in deeper. She quickly complied, having no intention in torturing him and took his entire length in one motion.</p><p>\u201cA-a-ah!\u201d Peter threw his head back, into the cupboard, his hands grabbed at his hair, simultaneously covering his face. His head was spinning. Rushing to relief him, she moved her head quickly up and down his entire member, her tongue flickering his tip. Peter\u2019s body got immensely tense as he shuddered, raising his hips higher, gravitating towards the heat behind her lips. Then, she brought her hand closer and cupped his balls, squeezing them lightly, and Peter absolutely lost it. Screaming her name, his back arched and his hips bucked into her mouth as he unleashed a thick spurt of cum down her throat, his entire body trembling.</p><p>She made an attempt to swallow, but Peter released so much it started spilling from her mouth, down his cock, and onto the sheets, as she continued to suck him through his orgasm. By the time he stopped ejaculating, all she could think about was how overwhelmingly wet she was: her pussy was dripping all over the already wet bed.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cock was still rock hard, even after the blowjob. Hours of him lying on the edge of orgasm without achieving it led to a lot of unleashed sex drive and sperm, which had to be released in more than one go. She looked up at him, wiping her lips. Peter\u2019s breath was heavy, he was looking at her through the daze in his eyes, completely disoriented. She started to slowly make her way up his body, her breasts accidentally caressing his tip. Peter whimpered, his cock spasming from the sensation. Even after orgasm, he was still immensely sensitive. She slipped her hands up his torso, her body gently sliding against his, making Peter moan shakily. He was flaming hot, his body felt like an open fire, few degrees higher and it would actually burn her skin.</p><p>She positioned herself above him, her pussy inches from his cock. It was magnetizing, drops of lube were dripping on his tip, and it made Peter\u2019s body shiver. Locking her gaze with his, she parted her outer lips with her fingers and slowly slid down his length with sloshing sounds, mewling from the feeling of Peter inside her. She could feel his cock pulsating and it made her walls clench around him harder.</p><p>\u201cOh g-god,\u201d Peter sobbed, his hands raising to find hers and intertwine their fingers. \u201cPle-ase, mo-ve, a-ah, please please ple-ase.\u201d</p><p>She let out a trembling breath and started grinding her hips against his lap, parting her lips from the sense of flaming friction. Peter\u2019s hands squeezed her own tighter, and she raised them up to the sides of his head to fixate him. His cock was never huger, it must\u2019ve been from the long waiting in heat. It was tearing her apart, spreading her walls. She moaned with her mouth open, saliva dripping onto his chest. Peter leaned in and smashed his lips against hers in a sloppy kiss, their teeth clashing.<br/>\u201cI\u2019m so-sorry,\u201d her voice was lewd and jumpy from the thrusts, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014a-ah!\u201d</p><p>Regaining some strength, Peter removed his hands and squeezed her waist tightly and started slamming her down onto his cock in aiding motions, his hips jerking up for additional impact. She cried, licking and biting at Peter\u2019s neck, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>\u201cSo good, so-o go-od, yes yes ye-s,\u201d she praised him, tears spilling from her eyes. She lifted herself up a bit so she could see Peter\u2019s face, their noses touching. Peter\u2019s face was red, veins pumping on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI wa-anted it f-for so lo-ng,\u201d Peter sobbed, losing his breath, \u201cit feels so-o good, so good.\u201d</p><p>He repositioned himself and began to pin her down with renewed force, his hips smashing into her from beneath. The tip of his cock was pounding into her cervix, making her stick her tongue out in ecstasy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop don\u2019t stop don\u2019t stop,\u201d her voice got higher with every word as her body twisted, anticipating release. Peter groaned, his fingers digging into her hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum gonna cum,\u201d he breathed shakily, raising his head and caressing her lips with his.</p><p>Moments before the high, she started choking from the thrusting force. She threw her head back, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she screamed Peter\u2019s name, slammed into her orgasm. She proceeded to jump on Peter\u2019s lap rapidly, riding through her orgasm and mewling from overstimulation, seeing Peter\u2019s tense face as he reached the same edge he\u2019s been on for the last four hours at least. From one of the thrusts, her folds clenched tightly around Peter\u2019s length and he cried, arching his back, pressing his head into the cupboard, hit with the strongest heat orgasm he\u2019s ever had. His vision went black as he covered his face with his arms, shivering with all his muscles. She lied powerlessly on his chest, his cock still inside her, having no strength to get off it.</p><p>Letting a few quiet sobs, Peter went quiet, his breath gradually becoming steady.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she whispered. Not receiving any reaction in response, she raised her head a bit. \u201cPeter. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah,\u201d he croaked, barely able to speak. \u201cI think I passed out.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget about the heat again, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled tiredly in return. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She gained her strength and got up from his cock. There was so much sperm, it began to spill down her inner thighs. Peter opened his eyes and moaned quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh no, please cover yourself,\u201d he said, covering his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d She tilted her head in question.<br/></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look at you,\u201d he said, covering his face with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m about to have a boner, and I\u2019m not ready for another one of those for like, another week.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and, realizing what he was talking about, quickly pulled a bed sheet, covering the lower part of her body. Smiling, she lied next to Peter, peaking underneath the pillow and removing wet strings of hair from his tired face.<br/>\u201cAlso,\u201d he began quietly, averting his glance.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there are now videos of Spiderman, lying on the ground with a huge boner and humping the asphalt.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, getting closer and covering them both with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cI always knew he was a kinky perv.\u201d She closed her eyes and kissed Peter softly, feeling him smiling.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said the moment after they parted their lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you more, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you most.\u201d<br/></p><!-- more --><p><b>My (first!) tag list:</b><br/><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHR16o2EsrknJJTbhiDV9zg\">@lousimusician</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLdoImSI55901X4IAg-vDvw\">@campcampie</a> @calypsolotus <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnUIpWWoh1sC0aIxe4Iozg\">@mlt2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhGHqTOU9UWtvLKdPvzNUBA\">@zelda2248</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjCsnC50wNm1nyckdqyQyPA\">@imarockstar45</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms8BYgw8p-0FRBslkkJkp_w\">@professsionalsinner</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m27O2ClLPj9t4FwLrbx7Sdg\">@hae-bee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSBLtcw9FQsDFvPJaIBVow\">@madisonn-chapman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGaDoKH3TQaJScU3toa7Q0g\">@itsbqueenthings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrsLnAcj7FbNVWTYnNDv9-w\">@dean-the-smol-bean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjiGrPZBSTnWHDB8MgFJjew\">@notobsessed-justobservant</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@peterbrokenparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY__Vs2XhZZrLljIx3pK7bQ\">@pxkajesus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfoEke3SLr9aaZ0UCF6RrJw\">@jxhnten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdnuxgEmyAC4SWzz3sedqFw\">@oais-sis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgMgLP_QPdtKJtY7nGT9rDg\">@avngrsinitiative</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnzEYXfI3xF8Z3Jy6q6yIEQ\">@russian-potatoes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOfhh9wTr76WWG4IkI0Grw\">@iamburdened</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDGE79xUs4fQHFRAXqKgnSA\">@mirenkristina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myXsfySIYOq7_N9kLc2TZOg\">@cin-sweetie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLwdG-0sgKHOAMFBeddI-7A\">@onyxbunny22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\">@maryhuffxoxo</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://danicarosaline.tumblr.com/\" title=\"danicarosaline\">danicarosaline</a>\u00a0</p>",

Hours of him lying on the edge of orgasm without achieving it led to a lot of unleashed sex drive and sperm, which had to be released in more than one go. She looked up at him, wiping her lips. Peter&rsquo;s breath was heavy, he was looking at her through the daze in his eyes, completely disoriented. She started to slowly make her way up his body, her breasts accidentally caressing his tip. Peter whimpered, his cock spasming from the sensation. Even after orgasm, he was still immensely sensitive. She slipped her hands up his torso, her body gently sliding against his, making Peter moan shakily. He was flaming hot, his body felt like an open fire, few degrees higher and it would actually burn her skin.</p>\n<p>She positioned herself above him, her pussy inches from his cock. It was magnetizing, drops of lube were dripping on his tip, and it made Peter&rsquo;s body shiver. Locking her gaze with his, she parted her outer lips with her fingers and slowly slid down his length with sloshing sounds, mewling from the feeling of Peter inside her. She could feel his cock pulsating and it made her walls clench around him harder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh g-god,&rdquo; Peter sobbed, his hands raising to find hers and intertwine their fingers. &ldquo;Ple-ase, mo-ve, a-ah, please please ple-ase.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She let out a trembling breath and started grinding her hips against his lap, parting her lips from the sense of flaming friction. Peter&rsquo;s hands squeezed her own tighter, and she raised them up to the sides of his head to fixate him. His cock was never huger, it must&rsquo;ve been from the long waiting in heat. It was tearing her apart, spreading her walls. She moaned with her mouth open, saliva dripping onto his chest. Peter leaned in and smashed his lips against hers in a sloppy kiss, their teeth clashing.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so-sorry,&rdquo; her voice was lewd and jumpy from the thrusts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;a-ah!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Regaining some strength, Peter removed his hands and squeezed her waist tightly and started slamming her down onto his cock in aiding motions, his hips jerking up for additional impact. She cried, licking and biting at Peter&rsquo;s neck, sobbing into his ear.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So good, so-o go-od, yes yes ye-s,&rdquo; she praised him, tears spilling from her eyes. She lifted herself up a bit so she could see Peter&rsquo;s face, their noses touching. Peter&rsquo;s face was red, veins pumping on his forehead.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wa-anted it f-for so lo-ng,&rdquo; Peter sobbed, losing his breath, &ldquo;it feels so-o good, so good.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He repositioned himself and began to pin her down with renewed force, his hips smashing into her from beneath. The tip of his cock was pounding into her cervix, making her stick her tongue out in ecstasy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop don&rsquo;t stop don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; her voice got higher with every word as her body twisted, anticipating release. Peter groaned, his fingers digging into her hips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cum gonna cum,&rdquo; he breathed shakily, raising his head and caressing her lips with his.</p>\n<p>Moments before the high, she started choking from the thrusting force. She threw her head back, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she screamed Peter&rsquo;s name, slammed into her orgasm. She proceeded to jump on Peter&rsquo;s lap rapidly, riding through her orgasm and mewling from overstimulation, seeing Peter&rsquo;s tense face as he reached the same edge he&rsquo;s been on for the last four hours at least. From one of the thrusts, her folds clenched tightly around Peter&rsquo;s length and he cried, arching his back, pressing his head into the cupboard, hit with the strongest heat orgasm he&rsquo;s ever had. His vision went black as he covered his face with his arms, shivering with all his muscles. She lied powerlessly on his chest, his cock still inside her, having no strength to get off it.</p>\n<p>Letting a few quiet sobs, Peter went quiet, his breath gradually becoming steady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she whispered. Not receiving any reaction in response, she raised her head a bit. &ldquo;Peter. You okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah,&rdquo; he croaked, barely able to speak. &ldquo;I think I passed out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She chuckled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not forget about the heat again, yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter chuckled tiredly in return. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She gained her strength and got up from his cock. There was so much sperm, it began to spill down her inner thighs. Peter opened his eyes and moaned quietly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh no, please cover yourself,&rdquo; he said, covering his eyes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; She tilted her head in question.<br></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t look at you,&rdquo; he said, covering his face with a pillow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m about to have a boner, and I&rsquo;m not ready for another one of those for like, another week.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She looked down and, realizing what he was talking about, quickly pulled a bed sheet, covering the lower part of her body. Smiling, she lied next to Peter, peaking underneath the pillow and removing wet strings of hair from his tired face.<br>&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; he began quietly, averting his glance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think there are now videos of Spiderman, lying on the ground with a huge boner and humping the asphalt.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She laughed, getting closer and covering them both with a pillow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I always knew he was a kinky perv.&rdquo; She closed her eyes and kissed Peter softly, feeling him smiling.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said the moment after they parted their lips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love you more, Peter.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I love you most.&rdquo;<br></p>\n",

As NSFW as it gets, you better sit down</p><p><a href=\"https://almostrealdudes.tumblr.com/post/184767296009\">PART 1</a></p><hr><p><br></p><p>In a desperate need to catch a taxi, she literally threw herself in front of a car, urging it to stop. Getting an inviting gesture from the driver, she jumped inside on the passenger seat and spat out the address.</p><p>\u201cGo go go, please, I need to get there as fast as possible,\u201d she babbled, opening her chat with Peter and starting to type rapidly.</p><p>\u201cGeez, what\u2019s the hurry?\u201d the driver asked, turning his wheel and merging with the car flow.</p><p><i>oh my god</i></p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is in trouble,\u201d she said, shaking nervously.</p><p><i>oh my god peter im so sorry</i></p><p><i>im omw</i></p><p>\u201cHe needs me,\u201d she said quitter, finishing her last message.</p><p><i>please hang in there im coming</i></p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d said the driver, throwing a quick look at her, \u201cbut it\u2019s rush hour, lady. I\u2019ll try to get you there as fast as I can, but your boy chose the worst time to be in trouble. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. It\u2019s on me. I should\u2019ve known it was about to happen, but I completely forgot.\u201d Her leg was shaking in a nervous tick as she watched the road lights change from red to green, hoping they\u2019ll make it through the next one.</p><p>\u201cMy, what is it with your boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a\u2026 condition,\u201d her cheeks flushed red. She imagined Peter\u2019s possible state, all hot and bothered, unwillingly edging himself, desperate for human contact. For contact with her. She pressed her thighs closer together. The situation, although alarming, was extremely arousing at the same time.</p><p>\u201cA condition? Is it dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know\u2026 is it lethal?\u201d asked the driver nonchalantly, taking another turn.</p><p>\u201cOh god, no! God, I hope it\u2019s not!\u201d her eyes grew bigger as she let the frightful thoughts enter her mind. She heard her phone beep, notifying her of a new message, making her heart beat even faster than it already was. She opened the chat again.</p><p><i>please hurry</i></p><p><i>its bad</i></p><p>\u201cAh. See? I told you. Rush hour.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see a wall of red lights in front of her. All the cars were frozen in place, all the rows were stuck dead until the very end of the road, which was pretty far away. She pressed her lips tightly together. This won\u2019t do. It will take her forever to get home if she continues like this.</p><p>She had to run.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve got this from here.\u201d</p><p>She took out the money and slammed it onto the car dash, unbuckling her seatbelt and quickly getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHey! Careful, you punk!\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she could remotely hear her driver say before she took off. To say she ran fast would be a huge understatement. Never in her life has she run as fast as she was running now. Gladly, they managed to make some progress on the road, and the apartment was not as far away. Checking the time, she maneuvered through the crowd, getting gradually closer. When she could see her building at the end of the street, she picked up the pace as if seeing the finish line at a marathon. At the front door, she tried to dial the entrance code, making mistakes thrice, because her shaking fingers kept missing the right buttons. After hearing the buzz, she flew into the main hall and rushed up the stairs, getting the keys out of the bag in advance. Finally, at the apartment door, she started going through all the keys with her shaking fingers, struggling to find the right one. Mailbox, office, parent\u2019s house\u2026 there, the apartment key. She shoved it in and turned until a click, smashing the door open.</p><hr><p><br>Peter couldn\u2019t move a muscle. All the energy was going from all the parts of his body straight into his cock, which was glowing from how red, swollen, and tense it was. Peter has never felt worse in his life: it was a feeling of constant, unflagging, ongoing edging. His body was in an insufferable pre-orgasmic state, and Peter\u2019s mind was going absolutely insane from all the hours of denied relief. He was crying, letting out desperate sobs, unable to take it anymore. His hand was fixated around his shaft, pumping it without pause for god knows how long, without any results.</p><p>When the door was thrown open, he thought he was hallucinating. But then, a strong, wild, dizzying smell filled the apartment, making Peter\u2019s body shudder in anticipation. It was perfume, sweat, and her natural scent, which made the veins on his length pulsate with renewed vigor. He moaned, inhaling every last bit of it, its hints stimulating every living inch of his body.</p><p>The state of him was heartbreaking. But god how extremely sexual it was: Peter\u2019s body, covered in sweat and precum, twirling and quivering in wrinkled sheets, his cock squeezed tightly in his hand, leaking from his hyperarousal. Her folds clenched at the view, leaking from the mere thought of his pulsating cock inside her.</p><p>And fuck did he feel it. Her presence in the room after hours of sexual solitude felt like a whole new world of sensations. He could smell her fluids slowly soaking her underwear, he could feel the heat coming from between her legs and it drove him absolutely crazy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d she said quietly, astounded.</p><p>\u201cPle-ease,\u201d he sobbed, \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I ca-an\u2019t, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Peter, I got you, I got you,\u201d she mumbled, quickly undressing completely and climbing onto the bed. She was afraid to touch him first, it could worsen the situation. So she loomed over his cock, positioning herself more comfortably. Peter could feel the time slow down as she was slowly lowering her head to his member. He could feel all of it: the heat coming from her parted lips, the wetness inside her mouth. His own mouth opened in anticipation, saliva dripping from the corners. And then, her lips covered his tip and Peter screamed. His hips immediately jerked up, desperate for her to take him in deeper. She quickly complied, having no intention in torturing him and took his entire length in one motion.</p><p>\u201cA-a-ah!\u201d Peter threw his head back, into the cupboard, his hands grabbed at his hair, simultaneously covering his face. His head was spinning. Rushing to relief him, she moved her head quickly up and down his entire member, her tongue flickering his tip. Peter\u2019s body got immensely tense as he shuddered, raising his hips higher, gravitating towards the heat behind her lips. Then, she brought her hand closer and cupped his balls, squeezing them lightly, and Peter absolutely lost it. Screaming her name, his back arched and his hips bucked into her mouth as he unleashed a thick spurt of cum down her throat, his entire body trembling.</p><p>She made an attempt to swallow, but Peter released so much it started spilling from her mouth, down his cock, and onto the sheets, as she continued to suck him through his orgasm. By the time he stopped ejaculating, all she could think about was how overwhelmingly wet she was: her pussy was dripping all over the already wet bed.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cock was still rock hard, even after the blowjob.

Getting an inviting gesture from the driver, she jumped inside on the passenger seat and spat out the address.</p><p>\u201cGo go go, please, I need to get there as fast as possible,\u201d she babbled, opening her chat with Peter and starting to type rapidly.</p><p>\u201cGeez, what\u2019s the hurry?\u201d the driver asked, turning his wheel and merging with the car flow.</p><p><i>oh my god</i></p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is in trouble,\u201d she said, shaking nervously.</p><p><i>oh my god peter im so sorry</i></p><p><i>im omw</i></p><p>\u201cHe needs me,\u201d she said quitter, finishing her last message.</p><p><i>please hang in there im coming</i></p><p>\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d said the driver, throwing a quick look at her, \u201cbut it\u2019s rush hour, lady. I\u2019ll try to get you there as fast as I can, but your boy chose the worst time to be in trouble. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. It\u2019s on me. I should\u2019ve known it was about to happen, but I completely forgot.\u201d Her leg was shaking in a nervous tick as she watched the road lights change from red to green, hoping they\u2019ll make it through the next one.</p><p>\u201cMy, what is it with your boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a\u2026 condition,\u201d her cheeks flushed red. She imagined Peter\u2019s possible state, all hot and bothered, unwillingly edging himself, desperate for human contact. For contact with her. She pressed her thighs closer together. The situation, although alarming, was extremely arousing at the same time.</p><p>\u201cA condition? Is it dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know\u2026 is it lethal?\u201d asked the driver nonchalantly, taking another turn.</p><p>\u201cOh god, no! God, I hope it\u2019s not!\u201d her eyes grew bigger as she let the frightful thoughts enter her mind. She heard her phone beep, notifying her of a new message, making her heart beat even faster than it already was. She opened the chat again.</p><p><i>please hurry</i></p><p><i>its bad</i></p><p>\u201cAh. See? I told you. Rush hour.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see a wall of red lights in front of her. All the cars were frozen in place, all the rows were stuck dead until the very end of the road, which was pretty far away. She pressed her lips tightly together. This won\u2019t do. It will take her forever to get home if she continues like this.</p><p>She had to run.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve got this from here.\u201d</p><p>She took out the money and slammed it onto the car dash, unbuckling her seatbelt and quickly getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cHey! Careful, you punk!\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she could remotely hear her driver say before she took off. To say she ran fast would be a huge understatement. Never in her life has she run as fast as she was running now. Gladly, they managed to make some progress on the road, and the apartment was not as far away. Checking the time, she maneuvered through the crowd, getting gradually closer. When she could see her building at the end of the street, she picked up the pace as if seeing the finish line at a marathon. At the front door, she tried to dial the entrance code, making mistakes thrice, because her shaking fingers kept missing the right buttons. After hearing the buzz, she flew into the main hall and rushed up the stairs, getting the keys out of the bag in advance. Finally, at the apartment door, she started going through all the keys with her shaking fingers, struggling to find the right one. Mailbox, office, parent\u2019s house\u2026 there, the apartment key. She shoved it in and turned until a click, smashing the door open.</p><hr><p><br>Peter couldn\u2019t move a muscle. All the energy was going from all the parts of his body straight into his cock, which was glowing from how red, swollen, and tense it was. Peter has never felt worse in his life: it was a feeling of constant, unflagging, ongoing edging. His body was in an insufferable pre-orgasmic state, and Peter\u2019s mind was going absolutely insane from all the hours of denied relief. He was crying, letting out desperate sobs, unable to take it anymore. His hand was fixated around his shaft, pumping it without pause for god knows how long, without any results.</p><p>When the door was thrown open, he thought he was hallucinating. But then, a strong, wild, dizzying smell filled the apartment, making Peter\u2019s body shudder in anticipation. It was perfume, sweat, and her natural scent, which made the veins on his length pulsate with renewed vigor. He moaned, inhaling every last bit of it, its hints stimulating every living inch of his body.</p><p>The state of him was heartbreaking. But god how extremely sexual it was: Peter\u2019s body, covered in sweat and precum, twirling and quivering in wrinkled sheets, his cock squeezed tightly in his hand, leaking from his hyperarousal. Her folds clenched at the view, leaking from the mere thought of his pulsating cock inside her.</p><p>And fuck did he feel it. Her presence in the room after hours of sexual solitude felt like a whole new world of sensations. He could smell her fluids slowly soaking her underwear, he could feel the heat coming from between her legs and it drove him absolutely crazy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Peter,\u201d she said quietly, astounded.</p><p>\u201cPle-ease,\u201d he sobbed, \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I ca-an\u2019t, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, Peter, I got you, I got you,\u201d she mumbled, quickly undressing completely and climbing onto the bed. She was afraid to touch him first, it could worsen the situation. So she loomed over his cock, positioning herself more comfortably. Peter could feel the time slow down as she was slowly lowering her head to his member. He could feel all of it: the heat coming from her parted lips, the wetness inside her mouth. His own mouth opened in anticipation, saliva dripping from the corners. And then, her lips covered his tip and Peter screamed. His hips immediately jerked up, desperate for her to take him in deeper. She quickly complied, having no intention in torturing him and took his entire length in one motion.</p><p>\u201cA-a-ah!\u201d Peter threw his head back, into the cupboard, his hands grabbed at his hair, simultaneously covering his face. His head was spinning. Rushing to relief him, she moved her head quickly up and down his entire member, her tongue flickering his tip. Peter\u2019s body got immensely tense as he shuddered, raising his hips higher, gravitating towards the heat behind her lips. Then, she brought her hand closer and cupped his balls, squeezing them lightly, and Peter absolutely lost it. Screaming her name, his back arched and his hips bucked into her mouth as he unleashed a thick spurt of cum down her throat, his entire body trembling.</p><p>She made an attempt to swallow, but Peter released so much it started spilling from her mouth, down his cock, and onto the sheets, as she continued to suck him through his orgasm. By the time he stopped ejaculating, all she could think about was how overwhelmingly wet she was: her pussy was dripping all over the already wet bed.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cock was still rock hard, even after the blowjob. Hours of him lying on the edge of orgasm without achieving it led to a lot of unleashed sex drive and sperm, which had to be released in more than one go. She looked up at him, wiping her lips. Peter\u2019s breath was heavy, he was looking at her through the daze in his eyes, completely disoriented. She started to slowly make her way up his body, her breasts accidentally caressing his tip. Peter whimpered, his cock spasming from the sensation. Even after orgasm, he was still immensely sensitive. She slipped her hands up his torso, her body gently sliding against his, making Peter moan shakily. He was flaming hot, his body felt like an open fire, few degrees higher and it would actually burn her skin.</p><p>She positioned herself above him, her pussy inches from his cock. It was magnetizing, drops of lube were dripping on his tip, and it made Peter\u2019s body shiver. Locking her gaze with his, she parted her outer lips with her fingers and slowly slid down his length with sloshing sounds, mewling from the feeling of Peter inside her. She could feel his cock pulsating and it made her walls clench around him harder.</p><p>\u201cOh g-god,\u201d Peter sobbed, his hands raising to find hers and intertwine their fingers. \u201cPle-ase, mo-ve, a-ah, please please ple-ase.\u201d</p><p>She let out a trembling breath and started grinding her hips against his lap, parting her lips from the sense of flaming friction. Peter\u2019s hands squeezed her own tighter, and she raised them up to the sides of his head to fixate him. His cock was never huger, it must\u2019ve been from the long waiting in heat. It was tearing her apart, spreading her walls. She moaned with her mouth open, saliva dripping onto his chest. Peter leaned in and smashed his lips against hers in a sloppy kiss, their teeth clashing.<br>\u201cI\u2019m so-sorry,\u201d her voice was lewd and jumpy from the thrusts, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014a-ah!\u201d</p><p>Regaining some strength, Peter removed his hands and squeezed her waist tightly and started slamming her down onto his cock in aiding motions, his hips jerking up for additional impact. She cried, licking and biting at Peter\u2019s neck, sobbing into his ear.</p><p>\u201cSo good, so-o go-od, yes yes ye-s,\u201d she praised him, tears spilling from her eyes. She lifted herself up a bit so she could see Peter\u2019s face, their noses touching. Peter\u2019s face was red, veins pumping on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI wa-anted it f-for so lo-ng,\u201d Peter sobbed, losing his breath, \u201cit feels so-o good, so good.\u201d</p><p>He repositioned himself and began to pin her down with renewed force, his hips smashing into her from beneath. The tip of his cock was pounding into her cervix, making her stick her tongue out in ecstasy.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop don\u2019t stop don\u2019t stop,\u201d her voice got higher with every word as her body twisted, anticipating release. Peter groaned, his fingers digging into her hips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum gonna cum,\u201d he breathed shakily, raising his head and caressing her lips with his.</p><p>Moments before the high, she started choking from the thrusting force. She threw her head back, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she screamed Peter\u2019s name, slammed into her orgasm. She proceeded to jump on Peter\u2019s lap rapidly, riding through her orgasm and mewling from overstimulation, seeing Peter\u2019s tense face as he reached the same edge he\u2019s been on for the last four hours at least. From one of the thrusts, her folds clenched tightly around Peter\u2019s length and he cried, arching his back, pressing his head into the cupboard, hit with the strongest heat orgasm he\u2019s ever had. His vision went black as he covered his face with his arms, shivering with all his muscles. She lied powerlessly on his chest, his cock still inside her, having no strength to get off it.</p><p>Letting a few quiet sobs, Peter went quiet, his breath gradually becoming steady.</p><p>\u201cPeter,\u201d she whispered. Not receiving any reaction in response, she raised her head a bit. \u201cPeter. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Yeah,\u201d he croaked, barely able to speak. \u201cI think I passed out.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget about the heat again, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Peter chuckled tiredly in return. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She gained her strength and got up from his cock. There was so much sperm, it began to spill down her inner thighs. Peter opened his eyes and moaned quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh no, please cover yourself,\u201d he said, covering his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d She tilted her head in question.<br></p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look at you,\u201d he said, covering his face with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m about to have a boner, and I\u2019m not ready for another one of those for like, another week.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and, realizing what he was talking about, quickly pulled a bed sheet, covering the lower part of her body. Smiling, she lied next to Peter, peaking underneath the pillow and removing wet strings of hair from his tired face.<br>\u201cAlso,\u201d he began quietly, averting his glance.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there are now videos of Spiderman, lying on the ground with a huge boner and humping the asphalt.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, getting closer and covering them both with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cI always knew he was a kinky perv.\u201d She closed her eyes and kissed Peter softly, feeling him smiling.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said the moment after they parted their lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you more, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you most.\u201d<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><b>My (first!) tag list:</b><br><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHR16o2EsrknJJTbhiDV9zg\">@lousimusician</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLdoImSI55901X4IAg-vDvw\">@campcampie</a> @calypsolotus <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnUIpWWoh1sC0aIxe4Iozg\">@mlt2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhGHqTOU9UWtvLKdPvzNUBA\">@zelda2248</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjCsnC50wNm1nyckdqyQyPA\">@imarockstar45</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms8BYgw8p-0FRBslkkJkp_w\">@professsionalsinner</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m27O2ClLPj9t4FwLrbx7Sdg\">@hae-bee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSBLtcw9FQsDFvPJaIBVow\">@madisonn-chapman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGaDoKH3TQaJScU3toa7Q0g\">@itsbqueenthings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrsLnAcj7FbNVWTYnNDv9-w\">@dean-the-smol-bean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjiGrPZBSTnWHDB8MgFJjew\">@notobsessed-justobservant</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@peterbrokenparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY__Vs2XhZZrLljIx3pK7bQ\">@pxkajesus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfoEke3SLr9aaZ0UCF6RrJw\">@jxhnten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdnuxgEmyAC4SWzz3sedqFw\">@oais-sis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgMgLP_QPdtKJtY7nGT9rDg\">@avngrsinitiative</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnzEYXfI3xF8Z3Jy6q6yIEQ\">@russian-potatoes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOfhh9wTr76WWG4IkI0Grw\">@iamburdened</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDGE79xUs4fQHFRAXqKgnSA\">@mirenkristina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myXsfySIYOq7_N9kLc2TZOg\">@cin-sweetie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLwdG-0sgKHOAMFBeddI-7A\">@onyxbunny22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\"></a><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\">@maryhuffxoxo</a>\u00a0@<a href=\"https://danicarosaline.tumblr.com/\" title=\"danicarosaline\">danicarosaline</a>\u00a0</p>",

From one of the thrusts, her folds clenched tightly around Peter&rsquo;s length and he cried, arching his back, pressing his head into the cupboard, hit with the strongest heat orgasm he&rsquo;s ever had. His vision went black as he covered his face with his arms, shivering with all his muscles. She lied powerlessly on his chest, his cock still inside her, having no strength to get off it.</p><p>Letting a few quiet sobs, Peter went quiet, his breath gradually becoming steady.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she whispered. Not receiving any reaction in response, she raised her head a bit. &ldquo;Peter. You okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah,&rdquo; he croaked, barely able to speak. &ldquo;I think I passed out.&rdquo;</p><p>She chuckled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not forget about the heat again, yeah?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter chuckled tiredly in return. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>She gained her strength and got up from his cock. There was so much sperm, it began to spill down her inner thighs. Peter opened his eyes and moaned quietly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no, please cover yourself,&rdquo; he said, covering his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; She tilted her head in question.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t look at you,&rdquo; he said, covering his face with a pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m about to have a boner, and I&rsquo;m not ready for another one of those for like, another week.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked down and, realizing what he was talking about, quickly pulled a bed sheet, covering the lower part of her body. Smiling, she lied next to Peter, peaking underneath the pillow and removing wet strings of hair from his tired face.<br />&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; he began quietly, averting his glance.</p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think there are now videos of Spiderman, lying on the ground with a huge boner and humping the asphalt.&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, getting closer and covering them both with a pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;I always knew he was a kinky perv.&rdquo; She closed her eyes and kissed Peter softly, feeling him smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said the moment after they parted their lips.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you more, Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you most.&rdquo;<br /></p><p><b>My (first!) tag list:</b><br /><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mHR16o2EsrknJJTbhiDV9zg\">@lousimusician</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLdoImSI55901X4IAg-vDvw\">@campcampie</a> @calypsolotus <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVnUIpWWoh1sC0aIxe4Iozg\">@mlt2000</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mhGHqTOU9UWtvLKdPvzNUBA\">@zelda2248</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjCsnC50wNm1nyckdqyQyPA\">@imarockstar45</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muijrDdrp9h8JtKRtxmNfPw\">@jackiehollanderr</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCKGyB8y0bJM6lTdhbDcNdg\">@bluediamondsevie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/ms8BYgw8p-0FRBslkkJkp_w\">@professsionalsinner</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m27O2ClLPj9t4FwLrbx7Sdg\">@hae-bee</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgSBLtcw9FQsDFvPJaIBVow\">@madisonn-chapman</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGaDoKH3TQaJScU3toa7Q0g\">@itsbqueenthings</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mrsLnAcj7FbNVWTYnNDv9-w\">@dean-the-smol-bean</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjiGrPZBSTnWHDB8MgFJjew\">@notobsessed-justobservant</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m0YlrOK0iRymfnt2nZG0fsw\">@peterbrokenparker</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mY__Vs2XhZZrLljIx3pK7bQ\">@pxkajesus</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mfoEke3SLr9aaZ0UCF6RrJw\">@jxhnten</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mdnuxgEmyAC4SWzz3sedqFw\">@oais-sis</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mgMgLP_QPdtKJtY7nGT9rDg\">@avngrsinitiative</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mnzEYXfI3xF8Z3Jy6q6yIEQ\">@russian-potatoes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/muOfhh9wTr76WWG4IkI0Grw\">@iamburdened</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDGE79xUs4fQHFRAXqKgnSA\">@mirenkristina</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/myXsfySIYOq7_N9kLc2TZOg\">@cin-sweetie</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLwdG-0sgKHOAMFBeddI-7A\">@onyxbunny22</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mte-LQVZpI7LYHkvwPwMr_g\">@maryhuffxoxo</a>&nbsp;@<a href=\"https://danicarosaline.tumblr.com/\" title=\"danicarosaline\">danicarosaline</a>&nbsp;</p>",

Getting an inviting gesture from the driver, she jumped inside on the passenger seat and spat out the address.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Go go go, please, I need to get there as fast as possible,&rdquo; she babbled, opening her chat with Peter and starting to type rapidly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Geez, what&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; the driver asked, turning his wheel and merging with the car flow.</p>\n<p><i>oh my god</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;My boyfriend is in trouble,&rdquo; she said, shaking nervously.</p>\n<p><i>oh my god peter im so sorry</i></p>\n<p><i>im omw</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;He needs me,&rdquo; she said quitter, finishing her last message.</p>\n<p><i>please hang in there im coming</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry to hear that,&rdquo; said the driver, throwing a quick look at her, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s rush hour, lady. I&rsquo;ll try to get you there as fast as I can, but your boy chose the worst time to be in trouble. No offense.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;None taken. It&rsquo;s on me. I should&rsquo;ve known it was about to happen, but I completely forgot.&rdquo; Her leg was shaking in a nervous tick as she watched the road lights change from red to green, hoping they&rsquo;ll make it through the next one.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My, what is it with your boy?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He has a&hellip; condition,&rdquo; her cheeks flushed red. She imagined Peter&rsquo;s possible state, all hot and bothered, unwillingly edging himself, desperate for human contact. For contact with her. She pressed her thighs closer together. The situation, although alarming, was extremely arousing at the same time.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A condition? Is it dangerous?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know&hellip; is it lethal?&rdquo; asked the driver nonchalantly, taking another turn.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh god, no! God, I hope it&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; her eyes grew bigger as she let the frightful thoughts enter her mind. She heard her phone beep, notifying her of a new message, making her heart beat even faster than it already was. She opened the chat again.</p>\n<p><i>please hurry</i></p>\n<p><i>its bad</i></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ah. See? I told you. Rush hour.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She looked up to see a wall of red lights in front of her. All the cars were frozen in place, all the rows were stuck dead until the very end of the road, which was pretty far away. She pressed her lips tightly together. This won&rsquo;t do. It will take her forever to get home if she continues like this.</p>\n<p>She had to run.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;ve got this from here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She took out the money and slammed it onto the car dash, unbuckling her seatbelt and quickly getting out of the car.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey! Careful, you punk!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was the last thing she could remotely hear her driver say before she took off. To say she ran fast would be a huge understatement. Never in her life has she run as fast as she was running now. Gladly, they managed to make some progress on the road, and the apartment was not as far away. Checking the time, she maneuvered through the crowd, getting gradually closer. When she could see her building at the end of the street, she picked up the pace as if seeing the finish line at a marathon. At the front door, she tried to dial the entrance code, making mistakes thrice, because her shaking fingers kept missing the right buttons. After hearing the buzz, she flew into the main hall and rushed up the stairs, getting the keys out of the bag in advance. Finally, at the apartment door, she started going through all the keys with her shaking fingers, struggling to find the right one. Mailbox, office, parent&rsquo;s house&hellip; there, the apartment key. She shoved it in and turned until a click, smashing the door open.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br />Peter couldn&rsquo;t move a muscle. All the energy was going from all the parts of his body straight into his cock, which was glowing from how red, swollen, and tense it was. Peter has never felt worse in his life: it was a feeling of constant, unflagging, ongoing edging. His body was in an insufferable pre-orgasmic state, and Peter&rsquo;s mind was going absolutely insane from all the hours of denied relief. He was crying, letting out desperate sobs, unable to take it anymore. His hand was fixated around his shaft, pumping it without pause for god knows how long, without any results.</p>\n<p>When the door was thrown open, he thought he was hallucinating. But then, a strong, wild, dizzying smell filled the apartment, making Peter&rsquo;s body shudder in anticipation. It was perfume, sweat, and her natural scent, which made the veins on his length pulsate with renewed vigor. He moaned, inhaling every last bit of it, its hints stimulating every living inch of his body.</p>\n<p>The state of him was heartbreaking. But god how extremely sexual it was: Peter&rsquo;s body, covered in sweat and precum, twirling and quivering in wrinkled sheets, his cock squeezed tightly in his hand, leaking from his hyperarousal. Her folds clenched at the view, leaking from the mere thought of his pulsating cock inside her.</p>\n<p>And fuck did he feel it. Her presence in the room after hours of sexual solitude felt like a whole new world of sensations. He could smell her fluids slowly soaking her underwear, he could feel the heat coming from between her legs and it drove him absolutely crazy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter,&rdquo; she said quietly, astounded.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ple-ease,&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I ca-an&rsquo;t, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Peter, I got you, I got you,&rdquo; she mumbled, quickly undressing completely and climbing onto the bed. She was afraid to touch him first, it could worsen the situation. So she loomed over his cock, positioning herself more comfortably. Peter could feel the time slow down as she was slowly lowering her head to his member. He could feel all of it: the heat coming from her parted lips, the wetness inside her mouth. His own mouth opened in anticipation, saliva dripping from the corners. And then, her lips covered his tip and Peter screamed. His hips immediately jerked up, desperate for her to take him in deeper. She quickly complied, having no intention in torturing him and took his entire length in one motion.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A-a-ah!&rdquo; Peter threw his head back, into the cupboard, his hands grabbed at his hair, simultaneously covering his face. His head was spinning. Rushing to relief him, she moved her head quickly up and down his entire member, her tongue flickering his tip. Peter&rsquo;s body got immensely tense as he shuddered, raising his hips higher, gravitating towards the heat behind her lips. Then, she brought her hand closer and cupped his balls, squeezing them lightly, and Peter absolutely lost it. Screaming her name, his back arched and his hips bucked into her mouth as he unleashed a thick spurt of cum down her throat, his entire body trembling.</p>\n<p>She made an attempt to swallow, but Peter released so much it started spilling from her mouth, down his cock, and onto the sheets, as she continued to suck him through his orgasm. By the time he stopped ejaculating, all she could think about was how overwhelmingly wet she was: her pussy was dripping all over the already wet bed.</p>\n<p>Peter&rsquo;s cock was still rock hard, even after the blowjob. Hours of him lying on the edge of orgasm without achieving it led to a lot of unleashed sex drive and sperm, which had to be released in more than one go. She looked up at him, wiping her lips. Peter&rsquo;s breath was heavy, he was looking at her through the daze in his eyes, completely disoriented. She started to slowly make her way up his body, her breasts accidentally caressing his tip. Peter whimpered, his cock spasming from the sensation. Even after orgasm, he was still immensely sensitive. She slipped her hands up his torso, her body gently sliding against his, making Peter moan shakily. He was flaming hot, his body felt like an open fire, few degrees higher and it would actually burn her skin.</p>\n<p>She positioned herself above him, her pussy inches from his cock. It was magnetizing, drops of lube were dripping on his tip, and it made Peter&rsquo;s body shiver. Locking her gaze with his, she parted her outer lips with her fingers and slowly slid down his length with sloshing sounds, mewling from the feeling of Peter inside her. She could feel his cock pulsating and it made her walls clench around him harder.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh g-god,&rdquo; Peter sobbed, his hands raising to find hers and intertwine their fingers. &ldquo;Ple-ase, mo-ve, a-ah, please please ple-ase.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She let out a trembling breath and started grinding her hips against his lap, parting her lips from the sense of flaming friction. Peter&rsquo;s hands squeezed her own tighter, and she raised them up to the sides of his head to fixate him. His cock was never huger, it must&rsquo;ve been from the long waiting in heat. It was tearing her apart, spreading her walls. She moaned with her mouth open, saliva dripping onto his chest. Peter leaned in and smashed his lips against hers in a sloppy kiss, their teeth clashing.<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so-sorry,&rdquo; her voice was lewd and jumpy from the thrusts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;a-ah!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Regaining some strength, Peter removed his hands and squeezed her waist tightly and started slamming her down onto his cock in aiding motions, his hips jerking up for additional impact. She cried, licking and biting at Peter&rsquo;s neck, sobbing into his ear.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So good, so-o go-od, yes yes ye-s,&rdquo; she praised him, tears spilling from her eyes. She lifted herself up a bit so she could see Peter&rsquo;s face, their noses touching. Peter&rsquo;s face was red, veins pumping on his forehead.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wa-anted it f-for so lo-ng,&rdquo; Peter sobbed, losing his breath, &ldquo;it feels so-o good, so good.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He repositioned himself and began to pin her down with renewed force, his hips smashing into her from beneath. The tip of his cock was pounding into her cervix, making her stick her tongue out in ecstasy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop don&rsquo;t stop don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; her voice got higher with every word as her body twisted, anticipating release. Peter groaned, his fingers digging into her hips.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna cum gonna cum,&rdquo; he breathed shakily, raising his head and caressing her lips with his.</p>\n<p>Moments before the high, she started choking from the thrusting force. She threw her head back, her eyes rolled in the back of her head, and she screamed Peter&rsquo;s name, slammed into her orgasm. She proceeded to jump on Peter&rsquo;s lap rapidly, riding through her orgasm and mewling from overstimulation, seeing Peter&rsquo;s tense face as he reached the same edge he&rsquo;s been on for the last four hours at least. From one of the thrusts, her folds clenched tightly around Peter&rsquo;s length and he cried, arching his back, pressing his head into the cupboard, hit with the strongest heat orgasm he&rsquo;s ever had. His vision went black as he covered his face with his arms, shivering with all his muscles. She lied powerlessly on his chest, his cock still inside her, having no strength to get off it.</p>\n<p>Letting a few quiet sobs, Peter went quiet, his breath gradually becoming steady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she whispered. Not receiving any reaction in response, she raised her head a bit. &ldquo;Peter. You okay?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Huh? Yeah,&rdquo; he croaked, barely able to speak. &ldquo;I think I passed out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She chuckled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not forget about the heat again, yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter chuckled tiredly in return. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She gained her strength and got up from his cock. There was so much sperm, it began to spill down her inner thighs. Peter opened his eyes and moaned quietly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh no, please cover yourself,&rdquo; he said, covering his eyes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; She tilted her head in question.<br /></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t look at you,&rdquo; he said, covering his face with a pillow.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What?

I love your scenarios!! I\u2019m going through some endgame withdrawals and was wondering if you could do a bucky or Peter scenario that\u2019s kinda angsty like they make fun of the girl a lot and then she gets stood up for a date and they feel bad and try to comfort her or something like that? Thanks in advance!!</i><br/><b>a/n</b>: I kind of went crazy with the request I only used it as a basic guideline sorry lol. this is the longest oneshot I\u2019ve ever written I think lmao but I didn\u2019t want to make it two parts so&hellip;yeah. sunburn part one should be out sometime this week (and maybe another oneshot too, we\u2019ll see) hope you guys enjoy! there are no spoilers in this as I am pretending infinity war and endgame never happened :)</p><p><b>I do NOT have a tagslist ~ <a href=\"https://pparkerwrites.tumblr.com/post/170484664302/masterlist\">masterlist</a></b></p><hr><p>You let out a groan as your back slammed against the mat, shutting your eyes. Peter let out a cheer above you and pumped his fist, making you grimace slightly. He smirked down at you while you leaned up on your elbows, glaring at him and trying to catch your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice try,&rdquo; he snickered and offered you a hand but you huffed and swatted it away, getting up on your own. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a sore loser, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Parker,&rdquo; you muttered, brushing off your pants, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an even match when you pull shit like that, I don&rsquo;t have super powers!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said cheekily, making you roll your eyes. </p><p>Natasha pursed her lips and joined you both on the mat, crossing her arms while watching you glare at him. &ldquo;Kid, we said it would be without the super strength.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was without the strength,&rdquo; Peter stared at her wide-eyed, his innocent expression making you grit your teeth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault Y/N can&rsquo;t take me down normally-&rdquo;</p><p>You swiped your leg under his and knocked him down, not even caring if it was immature to do so. The look on his face made it worth it, and you put your hands on your hips, trying not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You kinda deserved that,&rdquo; Nat admitted. </p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;That was uncalled for,&rdquo; Peter grunted while you jumped off the mat, going to your water. &ldquo;I still won!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if you cheated!&rdquo; you spat back, resisting the urge to give him a middle finger while he muttered something under his breath, following you to grab a towel and wipe his face. He got a cheeky grin back on and threw the now sweaty towel at you, making you squeal and throw it on the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Gross, what is wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be an Avenger, and you&rsquo;re scared of a towel?&rdquo; He sneered a little, while you glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you two play nice?&rdquo; Nat sighed, coming up behind you both, &ldquo;How are you supposed to have each other&rsquo;s backs out there if you act like this in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just let him get-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t finish that sentence,&rdquo; Natasha interrupted, giving you a stern look. &ldquo;You know you wouldn&rsquo;t actually, and you wouldn&rsquo;t either, Peter, so don&rsquo;t speak up. Training can be done now, but we&rsquo;re going again tomorrow and if you use your strength again Peter, we&rsquo;re gonna have some problems.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i> I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>Nat just raised an eyebrow and Peter gave up, grabbing his things with a huff. You started unwrapping your hands, ignoring the angry feeling in your chest as Peter shot you a last dirty look and left the training room.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you two,&rdquo; she said once he was gone, giving you a look, &ldquo;You guys would be even better partners if you would just get along.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s annoying,&rdquo; you frowned, tossing the empty water bottle in the trash. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s like that with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, boys are mean to girls they like,&rdquo; she smirked a little and you made a face.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t kindergarten, Nat,&rdquo; you muttered, &ldquo;You sound like Sam.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sam might be on to something,&rdquo; she teased a little, dodging the towel that you went to smack her with.</p><p>Sam (and sometimes Bucky) liked to joke that you two would be perfect together if you weren&rsquo;t bickering all the time like an old married couple, and you tried not to let it hurt when Peter made a disgusted face at those comments.</p><p>At one point you were desperate to be friends with him, maybe even more, but that time had clearly passed.</p><p>When Tony told you a new recruit was joining that was your age, you were ecstatic. Being a teenager around a bunch of adults was a bit frustrating at times - you went to school, but for training and missions and whatnot, there was no one else your age. </p><p>Peter had been nice when you first met, you remembered that. But something seemed to click after a while, and suddenly he was getting cocky during sparring and making unnecessary comments about your fighting style. You thought maybe it was jealousy but it was obvious that he was getting along well with the others and sometimes even getting more praise than you did, so you weren&rsquo;t sure what his deal was.</p><p>The thing you hated most was that Peter got along with <i>everyone</i> - even Bucky, who did his best to avoid the kid after the whole airport incident a few years back. Tony obviously had a favorite (you didn&rsquo;t really mind it that much, you&rsquo;d never been close to Tony), Steve and him joked about Queens and Brooklyn, Scott and Clint had pranks with him whenever they came by. You got along with them too, but not like Peter did - he was clearly the preferred trainee around the compound, and you wished it didn&rsquo;t hurt to realize that.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s never gonna happen,&rdquo; you said flatly, grabbing your gym bag and swinging it over your shoulder as you walked out. Nat was just a step behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;You almost sound upset about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i>, stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you get distracted on your mission tonight-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might get distracted when I go after <i>you</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; she held her hands up, trying not to smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re briefing at six, leaving at seven, make sure you and Peter are ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we will be,&rdquo; you frowned as she walked away, pointing a finger at you while you made a face.</p><p>A few hours later and you were in the briefing room with Sam, Bucky, Natasha, and Peter. Everyone was in their suits, Peter&rsquo;s bright red and blue attire standing out against everyone else&rsquo;s, but he was yet to get a stealth suit made, so it had to do. </p><p>Natasha had a map projected on the table and was pointing out areas for each of you to go, and you weren&rsquo;t surprised to have her pair you and Peter up, despite the amount of times you both protested. There wasn&rsquo;t much of a point of arguing against it now - he was going to go where you went, and vice versa. </p><p>&ldquo;Barnes, Wilson, you two take the second floor, east side. Take the agents out, try and cause a big enough distraction for one of them to call a distress and get the rest of the base to go there. I&rsquo;ll get the intel on the west side, Y/N and Peter go to the third floor and get into the main office. Both of you keep with your pairs and watch each other&rsquo;s backs. Sound good?&rdquo; Natasha looked up at all of you, seeing Bucky and Sam exchange a look.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, pairing up the love birds,&rdquo; Sam joked, making you twitch a little. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you guys were together,&rdquo; Peter gestured at him and Bucky, making them both stop laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you two!&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle at that, missing how Peter grinned and looked a little pleased at the fact that he made you laugh. Natasha just shook her head while Sam and Bucky started bickering.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve retired,&rdquo; she muttered before smacking her hand on the table, getting everyone to shut up. &ldquo;I said, does the plan sound good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; you and Peter responded at the same time, making Bucky snicker. </p><p>&ldquo;Great, let&rsquo;s go before you all kill each other.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I feel like we&rsquo;re in a horror movie and we&rsquo;re about to get killed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why</i> would you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s just the energy of this place,&rdquo; Peter muttered, and you gave him a look that basically told him to shut up. </p><p>You were both crouched on an outside platform, waiting for an all clear on when you could enter. Peter had swung you both up to the third floor where no guards were waiting outside, figuring it was the best place to break in and enter when the time called for it. And you usually didn&rsquo;t like to agree with him, but he was right this time. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the second floor,&rdquo; Bucky alerted through comms, his voice quiet, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll signal when it&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Copy that,&rdquo; Nat replied. </p><p>You sighed and shifted a little, the position uncomfortable, especially with Peter so close to you. His suit at least looked comfortable, and he was probably a lot warmer than you - yours was tight and the belt was clunky and you certainly didn&rsquo;t have a heater, and it was freezing in the cold.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop shivering,&rdquo; Peter whispered, and you went to smack his arm but he dodged it easily.</p><p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Sam said in a rush and you heard yelling and gunshots through the comms. </p><p>Peter swung up to the window and kicked through it with his foot, not even needing to try hard for it to break. He offered you a hand and pulled you up, swiping some broken glass out of the way. You crawled in first, nearly falling forward but he managed to wrap an arm around your waist and catch you.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; you muttered, both of you looking down and seeing how far the ground was. </p><p>&ldquo;Careful next time,&rdquo; he muttered, startling you by sticking your waist with a web and pushing you down. You held the web tight and managed not to scream as he grabbed the end of it before you hit the floor, cackling above you.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncalled for,&rdquo; you muttered, hoping he couldn&rsquo;t hear how loud your heart was beating. &ldquo;You nearly gave me a heart attack!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was fun,&rdquo; he dropped down next to you, his masked eye winking while you tried to resist the urge to attack him. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, don&rsquo;t do that again.&rdquo;</p><p>You both fell into a silence as you turned on a flashlight, not entirely sure why the lights were off, but not having enough time to question it. The comms were like background noise in your ears and you could hear Sam and Bucky causing a ruckus on the floor below, hopefully creating enough of a distraction for no one to come find you both.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems like we have the whole base in here,&rdquo; Bucky said through the comms, &ldquo;You guys should be clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone here,&rdquo; Natasha replied, &ldquo;Y/N, Peter, you guys have been silent for a while, all good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably making out in a closet,&rdquo; Sam chuckled amongst the fighting, and you quickly rolled your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny how the kids are acting more mature than the adults,&rdquo; you snapped over the comms, missing how Peter cracked a smile - not that you would see it through the mask anyway. &ldquo;Are you even doing your job?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, she&rsquo;s getting attitude,&rdquo; Bucky whistled, &ldquo;Better watch out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; Natasha said sternly, making you relax a bit, &ldquo;We can make jokes later, we need to focus on getting the intel. Go off comms unless we have a problem, Sam let us know when you two are done with the agents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma'am,&rdquo; Sam responded, but you could still hear the smirk in his voice, &ldquo;Peter, keep your hands to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>You heard the comms click off and you muttered under your breath, while Peter was glad he was wearing the mask so you couldn&rsquo;t see how red the comments were making him. Finally you both came across the door, Peter putting an arm out to keep you from moving.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on,&rdquo; he put a hand to his mask, probably using some fancy update Stark had given him to look through and make sure no one was there. &ldquo;Alright, all clear.&rdquo;</p><p>You jiggled the handle, frowning as you dropped your hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p><p>His mask shifted into what you assumed was a smirk, and he simply grabbed the handle and snapped it off, pushing the door open. He bowed and held his arm out to let you walk first, making you frown in annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;Show off,&rdquo; you muttered, fumbling to grab the flash drive from your pocket as you hurried to the computer. Peter just snorted and shut the door behind you, putting a chair up to block it.</p><p>You typed quickly on the computer while Peter stood next to you, his fingers twitching with impatience. There were several passwords that might have worked, and it was starting to annoy the both of you when it kept blocking you out.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go faster?&rdquo; He muttered, and you shot him a look. </p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> want to do it?&rdquo;</p><p>He just huffed and crossed his arms, looking around the room. It was mostly empty aside from some filing cabinets and chairs, but it was pretty large for just an office. You bit your lip as you finally managed to log in and start downloading the files. </p><p>&ldquo;This place is creepy,&rdquo; Peter said quietly, bouncing on his feet a little. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re distracting me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just trying to make conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s distracting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>You just rolled your eyes as you finished the code, ignoring how he kept fidgeting around. </p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; you pulled the drive out, sticking it in your belt and you began wiping the computer of any evidence that you both had been there.</p><p>&ldquo;About time,&rdquo; Peter muttered, and you went to snap back at him but suddenly you both heard voices from outside the room.</p><p>The door burst open despite the chair blocking it and Peter quickly yanked you down behind the desk. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t my senses go off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re too busy annoying me and it&rsquo;s distracting you,&rdquo; you whispered back, ignoring his masked eyes squinting at you in what you assumed was a dirty look.</p><p>You could both hear multiple people come in, and you looked at Peter while he listened. His enhanced hearing often helped him figure out how many people were in the room or even where they were. He held up seven fingers, making you frown a little. Someone was definitely tipped off. With a deep breath, you adjusted your suit and nodded to him. </p><p>Despite how often you both argued, you and Peter were good partners. You could fight together without really needing to verbally communicate, and you could almost always predict each other&rsquo;s moves. Missions with him got easier over time, even when the bickering was more frequent. </p><p>He jumped up first while you snuck to the side, waiting for him to cause a big enough distraction before you came in. You watched him web two guys and bring their heads together, wincing as they both crumpled to the floor. </p><p>Once the focus was on him, you came up behind the nearest guy and placed your hands on his shoulders, kicking the backs on his knees in and forcing him to kneel and fall forward. A gun shot rang out and you almost lost focus from the guy you were fighting by looking up in a panic, only to see Peter pulling the gun from one of the men&rsquo;s hands and webbing it to the ceiling where no one could reach. You relaxed a little knowing he wasn&rsquo;t shot.</p><p>You quickly grabbed the gun from the guy you were trying to force to the ground, hitting his head with the butt of it and knocking him out. The gun was quickly knocked out of your hands by another guy and you struggled against him, trying not to get distracted watching Peter at the same time.</p><p>He was handling two guys at once, which you thought was a little unfair, even with his super strength. You twisted yourself around and managed to get your guy around the neck, but he was smart and fell back, crushing you under him. With a wince, you managed to push him off of you and roll up, glaring as he stood up again.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to start fighting you again, clearly having the upper hand. You hated on missions, how easy it was for Peter to just take down several guys with no issue, while you had to struggle so hard not to get beat in - having super powers must&rsquo;ve been nice. You took a hit to the stomach and fell to your knees, rolling out of the way as he aimed a kick for you, not sure how much more you could take. This guy was bigger than anyone you&rsquo;d fought before. </p><p>You groaned as he pulled his arm back to hit you again, but a web stuck to it and yanked him back, his face going right into Peter&rsquo;s fist. His nose crunched and the sound of it breaking made you cringe as he crumpled to the ground, knocked out. It almost shocked you - Peter usually held back on hurting people that bad. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; he muttered as he came over to you, holding his hand out for you to take. He was surprised when you took it, letting him help you up while you tried to ignore the pain from that guy gut punching you.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you tried not to sound too bitter, snatching your hand back from him when you realized he was still holding it. &ldquo;That it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Think so,&rdquo; Peter moved around to make sure they were all out while you stared down at the guy, trying not to feel annoyed at how Peter could take him out with one punch, while you struggled with him for several minutes.</p><p>You nudged him with your shoe, relieved to see he was knocked out even if it was Peter who did it. He put his hands on his hips as he came back toward you, stepping over a few of the knocked out men.</p><p>&ldquo;Your spidey senses working now?&rdquo; You asked sarcastically, still out of breath as you held a hand to your side, feeling the ache from the punches and kicks.</p><p>Peter started speaking harshly to you but you weren&rsquo;t listening, your eyes focusing behind him to see a man hiding behind a desk you had both missed raise his gun at Peter&rsquo;s back, right where his heart was.</p><p>Your eyes widened and without thinking you yanked him around, letting the bullet catch you in the back of your shoulder. The pain made you collapse against Peter as you cried out, barely hearing his panicked voice asking what happened.</p><p>Peter finally caught sight of the guy angrily smacking his gun, clearly having some sort of issue with it, and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to shoot a web at him, using the taser webs that Karen always suggested but he usually tried to avoid. The guy dropped the gun and fell to the floor, the electricity knocking him out while Peter bent down next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why</i> did you do that?&rdquo; He asked in a panicked tone, kneeling down as he ripped his mask off. His face was blurry in your vision, even when he put his hands on your face and tried to make you look at him. &ldquo;Y/N, stay with me, come on-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; you hissed out, gripping his wrist probably too tight, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, sweetheart, I know, it&rsquo;ll be okay they&rsquo;re on their way,&rdquo; he put a hand up to his ear, tapping his comms while the other one still held your face. &ldquo;Natasha, you need to get here <i>now</i>. She&rsquo;s-she&rsquo;s been shot, someone, please-&rdquo;</p><p>You were definitely out of it if you were hallucinating Peter being this soft with you, right? Nat&rsquo;s voice was in your comms but you couldn&rsquo;t hear her, the only thing you could feel was your shoulder wound and Peter holding you, trying to keep you awake, but your eyes were starting to roll back.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey come on, I got you,&rdquo; Peter lifted you up carefully, avoiding your wound, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t pass out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you breathed out, not able to help it as your vision went dark, Peter&rsquo;s panicked tone trying to keep you awake fading out, and you blacked out.</p><p>-</p><p>The first thing you felt was the obvious sharp pain in your shoulder, the rest of your body having small aches and pressures. You could tell that you were in a hospital and it made you scrunch up your nose, hating the smell. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; You heard a soft voice ask, feeling fingers tuck your hair behind your ear and the quiet creak of a chair moving. &ldquo;You up?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; You barely opened your eyes, your sight a little blurry as you tried to focus on who was sitting there.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; you blinked and saw Peter next to you, a relieved smile on his face that made you confused. He never smiled genuinely at you. &ldquo;I almost thought you weren&rsquo;t gonna wake up, you-you really scared m-us! You really scared <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked exhausted, his hair all messed up and the bags under his eyes prevalent. You were confused by the pressure in your hand until you looked down, seeing how he was holding it in both of his tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you holding my hand? Did you think I died or something?&rdquo; You mumbled with a little smirk, but his face turned hard, clearly not amused by your teasing as he dropped your hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell did you do that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; You frowned, not liking the sudden hostility in his tone compared to how sweet he sounded when you woke up. Dumb of you to think <i>that</i> would last.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you realize how stupid that was? If he had shot you somewhere else you could be dead, I would&rsquo;ve been the reason you died and-&rdquo; Peter kept raising his voice, nearly yelling as he told you how idiotic you were being when <i>you</i> saved <i>his</i> life, which was starting to piss you off, considering you literally just woke up. </p><p>&ldquo;What, are you mad I stole your spotlight or something? Or are you upset that <i>I</i> saved your life? Which one is it?&rdquo; You interrupted, starting to feel the ache in your shoulder that was only making you angrier. <br/></p><p>He stared at you blankly for a minute, and you just glared back. It was obvious he had a lot more to say and you weren&rsquo;t sure you wanted to hear it. You had never seen him this upset about something before.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you seriously think that&rsquo;s what this is about?&rdquo; He asked quietly, and his tone somehow seemed angrier than when he was yelling. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m mad because I&rsquo;m jealous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why else would you be upset?&rdquo; You said, gritting your teeth a little. &ldquo;Just admit that&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m mad because you got <i>hurt</i>?&rdquo; He snapped, tugging a hand through his hair, &ldquo;Because I saw you get shot and you were bleeding out and I didn&rsquo;t know where you had been hit and I didn&rsquo;t know if you were going to die and it would have been my fault? Did you not think that maybe <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why I was mad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you care about me,&rdquo; you scoffed, but you remembered the moments before you passed out. You remembered his hands holding you and calling you &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; and speaking softly to you, the panic on his face- </p><p>Whatever. It was just in the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I care about you doing reckless shit that could get you killed. You could&rsquo;ve <i>died</i>, Y/N, do you not realize that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine was just a shoulder wound, <i>you</i> would&rsquo;ve died! What was I supposed to do, just let him shoot you?&rdquo; You asked harshly, accidentally moving your shoulder too much. The sharp pain had you wince, putting a hand on your shoulder and gritting your teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He asked quickly, getting up and letting his hands hover a bit, not sure what to do. It was almost funny how quick his mood changed. &ldquo;Should I get the doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you muttered, not sure if you were enjoying how weird he was being. The back and forth between him pissing you off and suddenly being nice was giving you whiplash. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t take it you would have, and it would&rsquo;ve hit you by your chest and you would&rsquo;ve died. I can handle a shoulder wound, you can&rsquo;t handle one to the heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can heal fast,&rdquo; he said flatly, sounding annoyed again. &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve been fast enough to dodge it, anyway, it never would&rsquo;ve hit me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t even know it was coming!&rdquo; You cried out, resisting the urge to raise your arms in disbelief, &ldquo;You asked me what happened, you didn&rsquo;t even realize someone was shooting at you, Peter! You know that, why can&rsquo;t you just admit that I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, but then your door opened, Natasha peeking her head in. &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re up. Parker, can I have a minute with her?&rdquo;</p><p>He shot you an angry look before stomping out, not saying anything to Natasha when he stormed by. She just raised her eyebrows and shut the door, giving you a quick look before taking the seat he was in.</p><p>&ldquo;He was in here the whole time,&rdquo; Nat said with a little smirk, and you felt your cheeks heat up. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t move from that chair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably only did that so he could yell at me the second I woke up,&rdquo; you muttered, carefully crossing your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you should&rsquo;ve seen how scared he was when he brought you back,&rdquo; she ignored what you said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen him that worried. And don&rsquo;t act like I didn&rsquo;t see him holding your hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long was I out?&rdquo; You changed the subject, knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t be quiet otherwise. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a day,&rdquo; she sighed, leaning back in her chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky. I&rsquo;m glad to know that you guys have each other&rsquo;s backs, that was obviously shown but&hellip;try not to get shot again. I don&rsquo;t need that on my conscious.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled a little, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. What about the flash drive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect work, as usual,&rdquo; she complimented, making you feel a bit better, &ldquo;We got the intel and no one else was hurt besides you. Which reminds me, you&rsquo;re on bed rest for a week minimum, and no training or anything crazy until your wound is healed, got it?&rdquo;</p><p>You wanted to argue, but even you couldn&rsquo;t be that stubborn. The bullet hole was starting to ache even more now that you had been awake for a while, and you could still feel the bruising from where you had been fighting. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I still go to my date on Friday?&rdquo; You asked, ignoring her little smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be healed up enough by then. Gotta say I&rsquo;m a little disappointed it isn&rsquo;t with Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you like this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just think you two would be cute, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she poked your nose, and you swatted her hand away while she laughed. &ldquo;But yes, you can go. Just be safe, and you know what to do if they start acting like an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can handle myself,&rdquo; you promised, &ldquo;Now can I please get something to eat? I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>You were allowed out of the hospital bed that night, much to your relief. You were tired enough to go to bed, hoping to avoid Peter on your shared floor - luckily he seemed to have gone home or something, because he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>Training for you was postponed until you got better, but you still attended sessions with Natasha and Peter so you could watch and listen to tips she gave him. </p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t speak to you, which was unusual. He might&rsquo;ve not liked you, but he tended to go out of his way to make sure you were aware of that - snarky comments, sarcastic quips, whatever it was that made your blood boil. Now it was like radio silence.</p><p>You figured he was still mad about your argument, which still made no sense to you. It&rsquo;s not like you expected him to thank you or anything, but he was acting way too angry about it - it was you who got hurt, so you didn&rsquo;t understand why he was being this bitter and petty with the silent treatment.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t matter, though, you had better things to think about. By Friday you had healed up, no longer needing a bandage and your bruises had mostly faded (nothing a little concealer couldn&rsquo;t fix if needed). You sat in the kitchen with Natasha, Sam and Bucky, who were getting ready for a mission of their own and trying to bribe you to make them food before they went.</p><p>&ldquo;If you eat now you&rsquo;re gonna get a side ache,&rdquo; you smacked Bucky&rsquo;s hand away from your sandwich while you cleaned up. &ldquo;Are you really that desperate for PB&amp;J?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, obviously,&rdquo; Bucky held his hands up and pouted, &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to make you one, maybe you can bribe Nat,&rdquo; you took a bite of your sandwich, wiggling your eyebrows at him and Sam, who looked offended.</p><p>&ldquo;When are you gonna start getting ready for your date?&rdquo; Nat shot you a little wink while your face went slack.</p><p>&ldquo;Natasha!&rdquo; You said sharply, ignoring all the eyes on you. &ldquo;I said don&rsquo;t bring it up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, who&rsquo;s taking you out? Is it Peter?&rdquo; You choked on your food while Bucky and Sam snickered, making you want to throw something at their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;None of your business, but no, it&rsquo;s definitely not him,&rdquo; you glared at Nat as you took another bite of your sandwich. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just someone from school, and you guys aren&rsquo;t my parents, so please chill out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, she&rsquo;s got an attitude today,&rdquo; Sam grinned, nudging your arm a bit. &ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>begging</i> you to shut up now.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha cracked a smile and left to get some work done while Bucky and Sam decided to stay and keep annoying you with questions, but after a few minutes luckily (or maybe unluckily) a new voice interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is everyone laughing?&rdquo; Your frown only deepened when a familiar set of curls was seen peeking over Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder, his eyes catching yours before quickly moving away. Weird.</p><p>&ldquo;Bet Spider-Kid here is gonna be jealous,&rdquo; Sam clapped Peter on the shoulders while him and Bucky laughed, Peter&rsquo;s face turning confused. &ldquo;Have fun on your date!&rdquo;</p><p>His face was blank for a minute while Sam and Bucky left chuckling, and you almost thought he looked upset - but then the corner of his mouth turned up. </p><p>&ldquo;You have a date?&rdquo; He gave you a shit-eating grin, &ldquo;Someone actually wants to date you?&rdquo;</p><p>You threw a spoon from the table at him, but he easily caught it, &ldquo;Yes, Parker, someone <i>actually</i> wants to date me. Will you just leave it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it tonight?&rdquo; He continued, ignoring your request while he tossed the spoon back. &ldquo;You should probably not wear Thor pajamas to a date, just a little advice.&rdquo;</p><p>You swatted his hand away from where he was tugging your Thor themed shorts (you weren&rsquo;t <i>that</i> embarrassed, and Thor thought they were hilarious). &ldquo;Back off, idiot, I&rsquo;m obviously not gonna wear these. And what advice would you know about dating, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>He made a face at that, &ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve dated anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not with your rude personality, no,&rdquo; you missed the slightly hurt look on his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go get ready now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should you really be going out on a date when you&rsquo;re still healing?&rdquo; He blurted out, making you frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would that matter? I&rsquo;m not going to be doing anything that would make me move it around?&rdquo; You looked at him in confusion as his face turned a little red and you scoffed, realizing what he meant.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re disgusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about <i>that</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a first date, dude, I wouldn&rsquo;t be-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is be careful-&rdquo;</p><p>You held a hand up, &ldquo;Whatever. I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head as he left, pushing the annoyance away and trying to focus on being excited. Peter watched you leave with a frown, losing the appetite that he had before walking into this conversation.</p><p>He would never admit it to anyone, but the idea of you going on a date&hellip;<i>hurt</i>. And when you came down an hour later and he had to see you dressed up and nervous and excited to go out with someone that wasn&rsquo;t him - it just made him feel worse. He covered those feelings up quickly, giving you a once-over. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you can actually look nice!&rdquo; You shot him a middle finger, pretending you didn&rsquo;t notice how he had definitely just checked you out.</p><p>&ldquo;If I come back and my snacks are gone, I&rsquo;m coming for you,&rdquo; you threatened, and he put his hands up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared,&rdquo; he mocked, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Can you go already? I have the floor to myself tonight and I&rsquo;d like you to not be in it, as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; you muttered, adjusting your jacket a little and hoping he couldn&rsquo;t tell how nervous you were. &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; He mocked your voice, but you were too wound up about the date to respond with something snarky, so you chose to just slam the door behind you.</p><p>-</p><p>They had asked you to meet them at a coffee shop, which you thought was cute - you knew them from school and you hadn&rsquo;t thought about going out with them, but when they asked, you couldn&rsquo;t help but get a little excited. It had been ages since you went on a date and maybe&hellip;it could help you get over some stupid, definitely unrequited feelings you <i>might</i> have <i>possibly</i> had for a certain boy.</p><p>Not that you would ever admit that to anyone, not even yourself.</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t there when you arrived, which wasn&rsquo;t that strange - you came a little bit earlier than you had both planned. You ordered a drink and sat down, trying to relax a little. The coffee shop was cute and there weren&rsquo;t many people there considering it was later in the day, soft music was playing and workers seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>After a while of fumbling with your hands and not doing much, you checked the time and realized it was past the time they were meant to arrive. You stared at your drink, biting your lip and tapping your feet. It was only ten minutes, that wasn&rsquo;t too long. They could be stuck in traffic, or held up with something. </p><p>You typed up a text, just offering to get a drink for them if they were running late, giving them the chance to explain but also trying not to be weird and flat out ask if they were still coming. You sent it and just sat and sipped on your drink as you waited, trying to ignore the bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>But ten minutes turned into an hour with no text back and you were getting a little concerned. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to be weird and stalk their social media to see if they were active, so you found yourself opening instagram and just going through the explore page. Some mutual friends of yours had stories up and you clicked on them to distract yourself, nearly dropping your phone when you realized what you were watching.</p><p>They were at a party, ones that you usually avoided, and you felt a little sick as you watched the video showing the person meant to be here with you, grinding up against other people while loud music played in the background and drunk people made a mess of themselves.</p><p>It was obvious that you were stood up.</p><p>You stared at your phone, your chest tightening at the realization that they were definitely not going to show up. That only left you with the option to go home, or wait here longer and ignore the stares of pity from the workers in hopes that maybe they&rsquo;ll still come.</p><p>But you weren&rsquo;t stupid.</p><p>With a sigh, you left a couple dollars on the table and hurried out of there, not wanting to see the looks on their faces. You typed a rather angry text before deciding it wasn&rsquo;t worth it and shoved your phone away, holding your arms around you while you started your walk home, trying not to feel pathetic.</p><p>You were obviously sad, you could feel the burning rejection in your chest and the tears forming at the edges of your eyes, but the idea of coming home early made you feel sick. It was only Peter there, and you could already imagine the look of glee on his face when he finds out you were stood up. </p><p>Hopefully he would&rsquo;ve gone to his room or would just ignore you, but you weren&rsquo;t sure it would be that easy.</p><p>It was quiet when you got back to the compound, and you tried not to make any noise as you got to your floor. You were sniffling a little as you came into the living room, hoping you could sneak past Peter, who was watching something on the tv, but you almost forgot about his spidey senses.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing back already?&rdquo; He asked when he noticed you, sounding a bit annoyed, but that tone quickly dropped when he saw your expression. He jumped up to block you from the hallway, concern taking over any annoyance he might have felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Are-are you crying?&rdquo; his voice went soft while you wiped your eyes, and looked down so he couldn&rsquo;t see your face.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you said miserably, sniffing, &ldquo;Can you move? I want to go to my room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>All you wanted was to sob pathetically into your pillow but he was just standing there looking like he actually cared about you for once, and that made you break down more. \u00a0</p><p>You were shocked when he pulled you to his chest, his arms snaking around your waist and hugging you, his voice attempting to calm you down. But instead of pulling away, you gripped the back of his shirt with your fingers and held him back while you cried, letting him comfort you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d never thought in a million years you&rsquo;d be hugging Peter Parker, but here you were, staining his shirt with your tears and make-up. He didn&rsquo;t seem to care, surprising you by pressing his lips to your hair and holding you tighter, murmuring sweet words under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said quietly once you calmed down a little, &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I probably look like a mess,&rdquo; you mumbled, not even sure why you were apologizing to him or why he was even comforting you in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;At least you smell good,&rdquo; he said flatly, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a laugh at that, giving him a weird look. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that smile!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so strange,&rdquo; you muttered, taking the excuse to step out of his arms, even though you didn&rsquo;t really want to. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Peter asked again, his soft tone making you relax a little. </p><p>&ldquo;They never showed up,&rdquo; you sniffed, still not able to meet his eyes. Peter was the last person you wanted to be this vulnerable in front of. &ldquo;And I saw on instagram that they&rsquo;re at some party. Maybe you&rsquo;re right, no one wants to date me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; he said quickly, before you even got the words out. &ldquo;Anyone would be lucky to have you, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, wondering who the hell was standing in front of you, because it sure wasn&rsquo;t Peter. Maybe Loki came back and was pretending to be him, because Peter would never be this kind to you, even if your heart just got stomped on.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you being so nice to me?&rdquo; You asked, not caring if it was blunt. &ldquo;Did you do something bad and now you feel guilty? I swear if you ate my snacks-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he chuckled a little, &ldquo;I just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like seeing you like this. Makes me want to go punch that idiot that stood you up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, so you&rsquo;re the only one allowed to be rude to me?&rdquo; You scoffed, though the words he said made you feel a little warm inside, even if you hated to admit it. </p><p>Peter stared at the ground for a minute before biting his lip, &ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him blankly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really in the mood to argue with you when I just got stood up, can we do this another time-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to argue,&rdquo; he promised, his tone sincere, &ldquo;I just&hellip;I want to explain why I&rsquo;ve been a dick. And I want to apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mouth almost dropped in surprise. &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, gesturing to the couch. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>You gave him a look, but decided it might as well happen. With a small sigh you wiped your eyes of any last tears or smeared make up and went to plop down on the couch, pulling your legs up while Peter sat across from you. He stared at the ground for a minute, seeming to collect his thoughts while you waited patiently.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; he finally said, making you raise an eyebrow. &ldquo;I never have. I was just jealous because when I first got here, you already had everything under control. You were my age but it still felt like you were my superior, and you knew what to do in any situation. I felt stupid, so I acted out in ways that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have. </p><p>&quot;You don&rsquo;t even need powers to kick my ass,&rdquo; he continued with a light chuckle, focusing on picking at his fingernails rather than meeting your eyes. &ldquo;It bothered me that even with my powers you were still seen as the better fighter. And&hellip;I only had my aunt and you had this family with the Avengers that I haven&rsquo;t really had and&hellip;and I guess I was jealous for a few reasons. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They think of you as family, you know,&rdquo; you pretended not to see the blush rising on his cheeks, &ldquo;Tony likes you more than me, you at least have to know that - he&rsquo;s obvious at playing favorites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you&rsquo;re Nat&rsquo;s favorite,&rdquo; he shot back, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but agree a little with that. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe, but she still likes you. They all do. Maybe I was here first, but they see us both as family, and equal members of the Avengers.&rdquo;</p><p>It went silent for a minute, and you realized that it was probably your turn to explain some things. Peter hadn&rsquo;t really started the hostility between you two, and you didn&rsquo;t necessarily either, but it wasn&rsquo;t one sided by any means.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a hard time getting along with people, but I also always want people to like me,&rdquo; you admitted, trying to ignore the intensity of his gaze, &ldquo;It took me a while to get close with this team since I&rsquo;m younger than them. But when you came along it was like they all immediately loved you, you barely had to try - it took me ages for that. I guess I was insecure about it and especially when you didn&rsquo;t get along with me, I just-I <i>hate</i> when people don&rsquo;t like me. Guess that&rsquo;s why tonight was an especially hard blow.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a harsh laugh, shaking your head while Peter stared at you for a minute. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they did that, you seemed really excited,&rdquo; he finally said quietly, &ldquo;You deserve better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter, but&hellip;I don&rsquo;t really mind, I wasn&rsquo;t that interested in them anyway,&rdquo; you scoffed, &ldquo;I think I just&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t been on a date in a while? And all the ones I&rsquo;ve been on have been shitty, and I just - I really want to go on a nice date, you know, with someone who actually <i>wants</i> to be with me, who treats me how I deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s someone out there who&rsquo;s gonna treat you right,&rdquo; he promised, suddenly very focused on his lap, not really making eye contact. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re closer than you think.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, not missing the light blush dusting his cheeks and the way he was sort of avoiding meeting your gaze. His nervous tell was how he tapped his fingers on his knees, biting his lip.</p><p>You were making him nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;How close, do you think?&rdquo; You asked quietly, shifting a little bit so you sat closer to him, but not making it too obvious. His eyes finally met yours and he saw your expression, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to answer. Instead, he carefully slid his hand into yours, maybe a little afraid that you would pull away and hate him again. But instead you let him, even giving his hand a little squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember the last time you held my hand?&rdquo; You said jokingly to ease the tension, and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me, that was the worst day I&rsquo;ve had since officially becoming an Avenger,&rdquo; he shook his head, making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Worse day <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> had? I was the one that was shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I thought I was gonna lose you,&rdquo; he responded without thinking, &ldquo;I was so mad because&hellip;because I was scared you were going to be gone and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do if anything like that happened to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you cared about me like that,&rdquo; you said, trying to ignore the butterflies in your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I care about you a lot,&rdquo; he admitted, his eyes searching over your face. &ldquo;I guess I just have a funny way of showing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter watched you as he moved his free hand to you, scooting a little closer when you didn&rsquo;t make any objection. He let his finger trail along your arm, raising goosebumps while he bit his lip, and you knew he was dragging it out on purpose, allowing for you to pull away if you wanted to. His eyes were on your lips, a smirk raising on his own as he leaned closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Your heart is beating really fast,&rdquo; he said, and you tried not to roll your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You can hear my heart beating?&rdquo; You asked while he brought his hand up from your arm to cup your face, and you were sure it started beating louder by the way his grin widened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very fair, it gives away how I feel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, m'sure mine&rsquo;s beating just as much,&rdquo; he murmured, and he didn&rsquo;t wait for you to answer before pulling your face to his and kissing you.</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t exactly shocked, he had definitely been making it obvious that he was about to lay one on you, but you couldn&rsquo;t help the noise of surprise you made when he pressed his lips against yours. But still, you didn&rsquo;t hesitate to kiss him back, your lips moving against his and your mind wondering why you spent all that time bickering with him when you could&rsquo;ve been doing <i>this</i>.</p><p>His nose rubbed yours as he moved closer, and you could feel him smiling a little, just making the moment sweeter even if it made the kiss messier. He hand cupping your cheek moved to the back of your neck while the one holding your hand was moved to your waist. </p><p>He pulled away only to press you back against the couch, the look in his eyes soft before he closed them, connecting your lips again as he leaned over you. You snaked an arm around his neck and let your hand find its way into his curls, your other one resting on the back of his neck while he laid himself against you, resting between your legs.</p><p>You tried not to smile against his mouth, not really sure you believed this was even happening. Were you actually locking lips with the boy you were sure hated your guts? Those thoughts were interrupted when he was quick to slip his tongue into your mouth, surprising you again, but you tilted your head and deepened the kiss, your fingers tugging his hair a little.</p><p>He hummed into your mouth as his hand brushed against your stomach when he went to hold your waist again, and you tried not to wince when he accidentally moved over one of the bruises that still remained from the mission. With some hesitation you made yourself pull back, almost laughing when he followed your lips, pouting a little when you put a hand on his chest to stop him.</p><p>&ldquo;We should slow down a little,&rdquo; you breathed out, trying to ignore the sharp pain in your shoulder and waist that was more evident now that you weren&rsquo;t distracted by his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t want to make out until Sam and Bucky walk in and prove them right?&rdquo; He smirked a little while you smacked him on the chest, laughing.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to move around too much, remember?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; he scrambled off of you, &ldquo;I forgot, are-are you okay, I&rsquo;m so sorry-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you chuckled, holding his arms so he didn&rsquo;t go too far. One of your hands moved to cup his cheek and he shut his eyes, smiling a little as you traced his jawline, brushing your thumb against his lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute when you worry, though.&rdquo;</p><p>He just grinned and leaned down, giving you a soft kiss while this time avoiding touching you in any way that might hurt you. His curls tickled your face as he moved his lips down your jaw, and you laughed a little as he pressed kisses against your neck, propping an arm up so he didn&rsquo;t squish you.</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I&rsquo;m loving this,&rdquo; you chuckled, and you could feel him smirking against your throat, &ldquo;I really think Sam and Bucky walking in on us is a big possibility that I&rsquo;d rather not face the consequences of right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where does this leave us?&rdquo; He pulled up, still leaning over you, his eyes bright and usually thin lips swollen from all the kissing were pulled into a lazy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you want it to leave us?&rdquo; You countered, letting your fingers trail up his arm while you didn&rsquo;t quite meet his gaze, choosing instead to focus on his crazy eyebrow or slightly crooked nose or freckles dotting his pink cheeks.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t think you could handle it if he didn&rsquo;t want to be with you after <i>that</i>. He didn&rsquo;t explicitly say he had feelings for you, what if this was just in the moment? Or he wanted some friends with benefits thing? You couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of him suggesting anything like that.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the door slamming open interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice made you both jump apart, you frantically trying to fix your shirt while Peter smoothed down his hair, as if that would really work. &ldquo;Hey, thought you were on a date?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cancelled it,&rdquo; you said quickly, hoping your mascara wasn&rsquo;t streaking from your crying earlier. &ldquo;I was just down here annoying Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Sam rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Sure you were. Night kids, don&rsquo;t do anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p><p>Instead of leaving with Sam, Bucky threw himself on the couch in between you both, changing the television channel with the remote. &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt your little date, but I didn&rsquo;t get to watch the game earlier, so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; you scoffed, pushing his face as you got up, making him laugh. You exchanged a glance with Peter, not sure what to do. You almost wanted him to follow you so that you could both talk, but at the same time neither of you wanted to tip Bucky off. The teasing was not worth it. &ldquo;Um, night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night,&rdquo; they both replied, Peter shooting you an apologetic look when Bucky wasn&rsquo;t looking, but you just gave him a smile and mouthed &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t really fine, especially when you went to bed and hoped that maybe he would come knocking on your door, but never did. You didn&rsquo;t fall asleep for a while, thinking that you were looking into it too much and then wondering if it even happened and if he would just ignore you for the rest of your life (maybe a little dramatic, but you&rsquo;d had an eventful evening).</p><p>But you did manage to fall asleep, and there was someone knocking on your door in the morning.</p><p>You opened your door to see Peter standing there with a bouquet of flowers and a bright, nervous smile on his face, and you felt stupid for staying up all night thinking he would just ignore you forever.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d take you out on a date,&rdquo; his face turned a little red, making your lips lift up in a small smile. &ldquo;We could go get breakfast and talk and you know, I can show you how you deserve to be treated? If-If you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; you said softly, taking the flowers from him and grinning. &ldquo;I should probably change out of these Thor pajamas though, right dating expert?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could keep them on if you want,&rdquo; he laughed, wrapping an arm around your waist and pulling you against him, being careful of your shoulder. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you do.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pressed a kiss to your lips, and you used your free hand to hold his face so he wouldn&rsquo;t pull away so quick. He chuckled against your mouth, definitely realizing what you were doing, but not finding that he cared as he just kissed you back, his arm holding you closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Um.&rdquo;</p><p>You both broke apart to see Bucky standing there with a cup of coffee, a surprised look on his face before he grinned and went back down the hallway. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; you mumbled, pushing your face into Peter&rsquo;s chest while he laughed, his face bright red. He put his other arm around you while you also starting laughing, hugging you to his chest while you heard Bucky screaming in the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You owe me fifty bucks Sam!&rdquo;</p>",

The look on his face made it worth it, and you put your hands on your hips, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou kinda deserved that,\u201d Nat admitted. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThat was uncalled for,\u201d Peter grunted while you jumped off the mat, going to your water. \u201cI still won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you cheated!\u201d you spat back, resisting the urge to give him a middle finger while he muttered something under his breath, following you to grab a towel and wipe his face. He got a cheeky grin back on and threw the now sweaty towel at you, making you squeal and throw it on the ground. </p><p>\u201cGross, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be an Avenger, and you\u2019re scared of a towel?\u201d He sneered a little, while you glared at him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you two play nice?\u201d Nat sighed, coming up behind you both, \u201cHow are you supposed to have each other\u2019s backs out there if you act like this in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just let him get-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d Natasha interrupted, giving you a stern look. \u201cYou know you wouldn\u2019t actually, and you wouldn\u2019t either, Peter, so don\u2019t speak up. Training can be done now, but we\u2019re going again tomorrow and if you use your strength again Peter, we\u2019re gonna have some problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i> I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>Nat just raised an eyebrow and Peter gave up, grabbing his things with a huff. You started unwrapping your hands, ignoring the angry feeling in your chest as Peter shot you a last dirty look and left the training room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you two,\u201d she said once he was gone, giving you a look, \u201cYou guys would be even better partners if you would just get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s annoying,\u201d you frowned, tossing the empty water bottle in the trash. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s like that with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, boys are mean to girls they like,\u201d she smirked a little and you made a face.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t kindergarten, Nat,\u201d you muttered, \u201cYou sound like Sam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSam might be on to something,\u201d she teased a little, dodging the towel that you went to smack her with.</p><p>Sam (and sometimes Bucky) liked to joke that you two would be perfect together if you weren\u2019t bickering all the time like an old married couple, and you tried not to let it hurt when Peter made a disgusted face at those comments.</p><p>At one point you were desperate to be friends with him, maybe even more, but that time had clearly passed.</p><p>When Tony told you a new recruit was joining that was your age, you were ecstatic. Being a teenager around a bunch of adults was a bit frustrating at times - you went to school, but for training and missions and whatnot, there was no one else your age. </p><p>Peter had been nice when you first met, you remembered that. But something seemed to click after a while, and suddenly he was getting cocky during sparring and making unnecessary comments about your fighting style. You thought maybe it was jealousy but it was obvious that he was getting along well with the others and sometimes even getting more praise than you did, so you weren\u2019t sure what his deal was.</p><p>The thing you hated most was that Peter got along with <i>everyone</i> - even Bucky, who did his best to avoid the kid after the whole airport incident a few years back. Tony obviously had a favorite (you didn\u2019t really mind it that much, you\u2019d never been close to Tony), Steve and him joked about Queens and Brooklyn, Scott and Clint had pranks with him whenever they came by. You got along with them too, but not like Peter did - he was clearly the preferred trainee around the compound, and you wished it didn\u2019t hurt to realize that.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s never gonna happen,\u201d you said flatly, grabbing your gym bag and swinging it over your shoulder as you walked out. Nat was just a step behind you.</p><p>\u201cYou almost sound upset about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get distracted on your mission tonight-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might get distracted when I go after <i>you</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she held her hands up, trying not to smile. \u201cWe\u2019re briefing at six, leaving at seven, make sure you and Peter are ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we will be,\u201d you frowned as she walked away, pointing a finger at you while you made a face.</p><p>A few hours later and you were in the briefing room with Sam, Bucky, Natasha, and Peter. Everyone was in their suits, Peter\u2019s bright red and blue attire standing out against everyone else\u2019s, but he was yet to get a stealth suit made, so it had to do. </p><p>Natasha had a map projected on the table and was pointing out areas for each of you to go, and you weren\u2019t surprised to have her pair you and Peter up, despite the amount of times you both protested. There wasn\u2019t much of a point of arguing against it now - he was going to go where you went, and vice versa. </p><p>\u201cBarnes, Wilson, you two take the second floor, east side. Take the agents out, try and cause a big enough distraction for one of them to call a distress and get the rest of the base to go there. I\u2019ll get the intel on the west side, Y/N and Peter go to the third floor and get into the main office. Both of you keep with your pairs and watch each other\u2019s backs. Sound good?\u201d Natasha looked up at all of you, seeing Bucky and Sam exchange a look.</p><p>\u201cOoh, pairing up the love birds,\u201d Sam joked, making you twitch a little. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you guys were together,\u201d Peter gestured at him and Bucky, making them both stop laughing. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you two!\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but giggle at that, missing how Peter grinned and looked a little pleased at the fact that he made you laugh. Natasha just shook her head while Sam and Bucky started bickering.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve retired,\u201d she muttered before smacking her hand on the table, getting everyone to shut up. \u201cI said, does the plan sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d you and Peter responded at the same time, making Bucky snicker. </p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go before you all kill each other.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like we\u2019re in a horror movie and we\u2019re about to get killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Why</i> would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s just the energy of this place,\u201d Peter muttered, and you gave him a look that basically told him to shut up. </p><p>You were both crouched on an outside platform, waiting for an all clear on when you could enter. Peter had swung you both up to the third floor where no guards were waiting outside, figuring it was the best place to break in and enter when the time called for it. And you usually didn\u2019t like to agree with him, but he was right this time. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the second floor,\u201d Bucky alerted through comms, his voice quiet, \u201cWe\u2019ll signal when it\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that,\u201d Nat replied. </p><p>You sighed and shifted a little, the position uncomfortable, especially with Peter so close to you. His suit at least looked comfortable, and he was probably a lot warmer than you - yours was tight and the belt was clunky and you certainly didn\u2019t have a heater, and it was freezing in the cold.</p><p>\u201cStop shivering,\u201d Peter whispered, and you went to smack his arm but he dodged it easily.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Sam said in a rush and you heard yelling and gunshots through the comms. </p><p>Peter swung up to the window and kicked through it with his foot, not even needing to try hard for it to break. He offered you a hand and pulled you up, swiping some broken glass out of the way. You crawled in first, nearly falling forward but he managed to wrap an arm around your waist and catch you.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d you muttered, both of you looking down and seeing how far the ground was. </p><p>\u201cCareful next time,\u201d he muttered, startling you by sticking your waist with a web and pushing you down. You held the web tight and managed not to scream as he grabbed the end of it before you hit the floor, cackling above you.</p><p>\u201cUncalled for,\u201d you muttered, hoping he couldn\u2019t hear how loud your heart was beating. \u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was fun,\u201d he dropped down next to you, his masked eye winking while you tried to resist the urge to attack him. </p><p>\u201cWhatever, don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>You both fell into a silence as you turned on a flashlight, not entirely sure why the lights were off, but not having enough time to question it. The comms were like background noise in your ears and you could hear Sam and Bucky causing a ruckus on the floor below, hopefully creating enough of a distraction for no one to come find you both.</p><p>\u201cSeems like we have the whole base in here,\u201d Bucky said through the comms, \u201cYou guys should be clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone here,\u201d Natasha replied, \u201cY/N, Peter, you guys have been silent for a while, all good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably making out in a closet,\u201d Sam chuckled amongst the fighting, and you quickly rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cFunny how the kids are acting more mature than the adults,\u201d you snapped over the comms, missing how Peter cracked a smile - not that you would see it through the mask anyway. \u201cAre you even doing your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, she\u2019s getting attitude,\u201d Bucky whistled, \u201cBetter watch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Natasha said sternly, making you relax a bit, \u201cWe can make jokes later, we need to focus on getting the intel. Go off comms unless we have a problem, Sam let us know when you two are done with the agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma'am,\u201d Sam responded, but you could still hear the smirk in his voice, \u201cPeter, keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>You heard the comms click off and you muttered under your breath, while Peter was glad he was wearing the mask so you couldn\u2019t see how red the comments were making him. Finally you both came across the door, Peter putting an arm out to keep you from moving.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he put a hand to his mask, probably using some fancy update Stark had given him to look through and make sure no one was there. \u201cAlright, all clear.\u201d</p><p>You jiggled the handle, frowning as you dropped your hand. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>His mask shifted into what you assumed was a smirk, and he simply grabbed the handle and snapped it off, pushing the door open. He bowed and held his arm out to let you walk first, making you frown in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cShow off,\u201d you muttered, fumbling to grab the flash drive from your pocket as you hurried to the computer. Peter just snorted and shut the door behind you, putting a chair up to block it.</p><p>You typed quickly on the computer while Peter stood next to you, his fingers twitching with impatience. There were several passwords that might have worked, and it was starting to annoy the both of you when it kept blocking you out.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go faster?\u201d He muttered, and you shot him a look. </p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> want to do it?\u201d</p><p>He just huffed and crossed his arms, looking around the room. It was mostly empty aside from some filing cabinets and chairs, but it was pretty large for just an office. You bit your lip as you finally managed to log in and start downloading the files. </p><p>\u201cThis place is creepy,\u201d Peter said quietly, bouncing on his feet a little. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to make conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever.\u201d</p><p>You just rolled your eyes as you finished the code, ignoring how he kept fidgeting around. </p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d you pulled the drive out, sticking it in your belt and you began wiping the computer of any evidence that you both had been there.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Peter muttered, and you went to snap back at him but suddenly you both heard voices from outside the room.</p><p>The door burst open despite the chair blocking it and Peter quickly yanked you down behind the desk. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my senses go off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re too busy annoying me and it\u2019s distracting you,\u201d you whispered back, ignoring his masked eyes squinting at you in what you assumed was a dirty look.</p><p>You could both hear multiple people come in, and you looked at Peter while he listened. His enhanced hearing often helped him figure out how many people were in the room or even where they were. He held up seven fingers, making you frown a little. Someone was definitely tipped off. With a deep breath, you adjusted your suit and nodded to him. </p><p>Despite how often you both argued, you and Peter were good partners. You could fight together without really needing to verbally communicate, and you could almost always predict each other\u2019s moves. Missions with him got easier over time, even when the bickering was more frequent. </p><p>He jumped up first while you snuck to the side, waiting for him to cause a big enough distraction before you came in. You watched him web two guys and bring their heads together, wincing as they both crumpled to the floor. </p><p>Once the focus was on him, you came up behind the nearest guy and placed your hands on his shoulders, kicking the backs on his knees in and forcing him to kneel and fall forward. A gun shot rang out and you almost lost focus from the guy you were fighting by looking up in a panic, only to see Peter pulling the gun from one of the men\u2019s hands and webbing it to the ceiling where no one could reach. You relaxed a little knowing he wasn\u2019t shot.</p><p>You quickly grabbed the gun from the guy you were trying to force to the ground, hitting his head with the butt of it and knocking him out. The gun was quickly knocked out of your hands by another guy and you struggled against him, trying not to get distracted watching Peter at the same time.</p><p>He was handling two guys at once, which you thought was a little unfair, even with his super strength. You twisted yourself around and managed to get your guy around the neck, but he was smart and fell back, crushing you under him. With a wince, you managed to push him off of you and roll up, glaring as he stood up again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate to start fighting you again, clearly having the upper hand. You hated on missions, how easy it was for Peter to just take down several guys with no issue, while you had to struggle so hard not to get beat in - having super powers must\u2019ve been nice. You took a hit to the stomach and fell to your knees, rolling out of the way as he aimed a kick for you, not sure how much more you could take. This guy was bigger than anyone you\u2019d fought before. </p><p>You groaned as he pulled his arm back to hit you again, but a web stuck to it and yanked him back, his face going right into Peter\u2019s fist. His nose crunched and the sound of it breaking made you cringe as he crumpled to the ground, knocked out. It almost shocked you - Peter usually held back on hurting people that bad. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he muttered as he came over to you, holding his hand out for you to take. He was surprised when you took it, letting him help you up while you tried to ignore the pain from that guy gut punching you.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you tried not to sound too bitter, snatching your hand back from him when you realized he was still holding it. \u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so,\u201d Peter moved around to make sure they were all out while you stared down at the guy, trying not to feel annoyed at how Peter could take him out with one punch, while you struggled with him for several minutes.</p><p>You nudged him with your shoe, relieved to see he was knocked out even if it was Peter who did it. He put his hands on his hips as he came back toward you, stepping over a few of the knocked out men.</p><p>\u201cYour spidey senses working now?\u201d You asked sarcastically, still out of breath as you held a hand to your side, feeling the ache from the punches and kicks.</p><p>Peter started speaking harshly to you but you weren\u2019t listening, your eyes focusing behind him to see a man hiding behind a desk you had both missed raise his gun at Peter\u2019s back, right where his heart was.</p><p>Your eyes widened and without thinking you yanked him around, letting the bullet catch you in the back of your shoulder. The pain made you collapse against Peter as you cried out, barely hearing his panicked voice asking what happened.</p><p>Peter finally caught sight of the guy angrily smacking his gun, clearly having some sort of issue with it, and didn\u2019t hesitate to shoot a web at him, using the taser webs that Karen always suggested but he usually tried to avoid. The guy dropped the gun and fell to the floor, the electricity knocking him out while Peter bent down next to you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why</i> did you do that?\u201d He asked in a panicked tone, kneeling down as he ripped his mask off. His face was blurry in your vision, even when he put his hands on your face and tried to make you look at him. \u201cY/N, stay with me, come on-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d you hissed out, gripping his wrist probably too tight, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart, I know, it\u2019ll be okay they\u2019re on their way,\u201d he put a hand up to his ear, tapping his comms while the other one still held your face. \u201cNatasha, you need to get here <i>now</i>. She\u2019s-she\u2019s been shot, someone, please-\u201d</p><p>You were definitely out of it if you were hallucinating Peter being this soft with you, right? Nat\u2019s voice was in your comms but you couldn\u2019t hear her, the only thing you could feel was your shoulder wound and Peter holding you, trying to keep you awake, but your eyes were starting to roll back.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey come on, I got you,\u201d Peter lifted you up carefully, avoiding your wound, \u201cPlease don\u2019t pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you breathed out, not able to help it as your vision went dark, Peter\u2019s panicked tone trying to keep you awake fading out, and you blacked out.</p><p>-</p><p>The first thing you felt was the obvious sharp pain in your shoulder, the rest of your body having small aches and pressures. You could tell that you were in a hospital and it made you scrunch up your nose, hating the smell. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d You heard a soft voice ask, feeling fingers tuck your hair behind your ear and the quiet creak of a chair moving. \u201cYou up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d You barely opened your eyes, your sight a little blurry as you tried to focus on who was sitting there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d you blinked and saw Peter next to you, a relieved smile on his face that made you confused. He never smiled genuinely at you. \u201cI almost thought you weren\u2019t gonna wake up, you-you really scared m-us! You really scared <i>us</i>.\u201d</p><p>He looked exhausted, his hair all messed up and the bags under his eyes prevalent. You were confused by the pressure in your hand until you looked down, seeing how he was holding it in both of his tightly. </p><p>\u201cAre you holding my hand? Did you think I died or something?\u201d You mumbled with a little smirk, but his face turned hard, clearly not amused by your teasing as he dropped your hand. </p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d You frowned, not liking the sudden hostility in his tone compared to how sweet he sounded when you woke up. Dumb of you to think <i>that</i> would last.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how stupid that was? If he had shot you somewhere else you could be dead, I would\u2019ve been the reason you died and-\u201d Peter kept raising his voice, nearly yelling as he told you how idiotic you were being when <i>you</i> saved <i>his</i> life, which was starting to piss you off, considering you literally just woke up. </p><p>\u201cWhat, are you mad I stole your spotlight or something? Or are you upset that <i>I</i> saved your life? Which one is it?\u201d You interrupted, starting to feel the ache in your shoulder that was only making you angrier. <br></p><p>He stared at you blankly for a minute, and you just glared back. It was obvious he had a lot more to say and you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to hear it. You had never seen him this upset about something before.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think that\u2019s what this is about?\u201d He asked quietly, and his tone somehow seemed angrier than when he was yelling. \u201cYou think I\u2019m mad because I\u2019m jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would you be upset?\u201d You said, gritting your teeth a little. \u201cJust admit that\u2019s the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m mad because you got <i>hurt</i>?\u201d He snapped, tugging a hand through his hair, \u201cBecause I saw you get shot and you were bleeding out and I didn\u2019t know where you had been hit and I didn\u2019t know if you were going to die and it would have been my fault? Did you not think that maybe <i>that\u2019s</i> why I was mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you care about me,\u201d you scoffed, but you remembered the moments before you passed out. You remembered his hands holding you and calling you \u201csweetheart\u201d and speaking softly to you, the panic on his face- </p><p>Whatever. It was just in the moment.</p><p>\u201cI care about you doing reckless shit that could get you killed. You could\u2019ve <i>died</i>, Y/N, do you not realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine was just a shoulder wound, <i>you</i> would\u2019ve died! What was I supposed to do, just let him shoot you?\u201d You asked harshly, accidentally moving your shoulder too much. The sharp pain had you wince, putting a hand on your shoulder and gritting your teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked quickly, getting up and letting his hands hover a bit, not sure what to do. It was almost funny how quick his mood changed. \u201cShould I get the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you muttered, not sure if you were enjoying how weird he was being. The back and forth between him pissing you off and suddenly being nice was giving you whiplash. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t take it you would have, and it would\u2019ve hit you by your chest and you would\u2019ve died. I can handle a shoulder wound, you can\u2019t handle one to the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can heal fast,\u201d he said flatly, sounding annoyed again. \u201cI would\u2019ve been fast enough to dodge it, anyway, it never would\u2019ve hit me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t even know it was coming!\u201d You cried out, resisting the urge to raise your arms in disbelief, \u201cYou asked me what happened, you didn\u2019t even realize someone was shooting at you, Peter! You know that, why can\u2019t you just admit that I\u2019m right?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, but then your door opened, Natasha peeking her head in. \u201cHey, you\u2019re up. Parker, can I have a minute with her?\u201d</p><p>He shot you an angry look before stomping out, not saying anything to Natasha when he stormed by. She just raised her eyebrows and shut the door, giving you a quick look before taking the seat he was in.</p><p>\u201cHe was in here the whole time,\u201d Nat said with a little smirk, and you felt your cheeks heat up. \u201cWouldn\u2019t move from that chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably only did that so he could yell at me the second I woke up,\u201d you muttered, carefully crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you should\u2019ve seen how scared he was when he brought you back,\u201d she ignored what you said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him that worried. And don\u2019t act like I didn\u2019t see him holding your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d You changed the subject, knowing she wouldn\u2019t be quiet otherwise. </p><p>\u201cJust a day,\u201d she sighed, leaning back in her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. I\u2019m glad to know that you guys have each other\u2019s backs, that was obviously shown but\u2026try not to get shot again. I don\u2019t need that on my conscious.\u201d </p><p>You smiled a little, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. What about the flash drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect work, as usual,\u201d she complimented, making you feel a bit better, \u201cWe got the intel and no one else was hurt besides you. Which reminds me, you\u2019re on bed rest for a week minimum, and no training or anything crazy until your wound is healed, got it?\u201d</p><p>You wanted to argue, but even you couldn\u2019t be that stubborn. The bullet hole was starting to ache even more now that you had been awake for a while, and you could still feel the bruising from where you had been fighting. </p><p>\u201cCan I still go to my date on Friday?\u201d You asked, ignoring her little smirk.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be healed up enough by then. Gotta say I\u2019m a little disappointed it isn\u2019t with Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust think you two would be cute, that\u2019s all,\u201d she poked your nose, and you swatted her hand away while she laughed. \u201cBut yes, you can go. Just be safe, and you know what to do if they start acting like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself,\u201d you promised, \u201cNow can I please get something to eat? I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>You were allowed out of the hospital bed that night, much to your relief. You were tired enough to go to bed, hoping to avoid Peter on your shared floor - luckily he seemed to have gone home or something, because he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Training for you was postponed until you got better, but you still attended sessions with Natasha and Peter so you could watch and listen to tips she gave him. </p><p>Peter didn\u2019t speak to you, which was unusual. He might\u2019ve not liked you, but he tended to go out of his way to make sure you were aware of that - snarky comments, sarcastic quips, whatever it was that made your blood boil. Now it was like radio silence.</p><p>You figured he was still mad about your argument, which still made no sense to you. It\u2019s not like you expected him to thank you or anything, but he was acting way too angry about it - it was you who got hurt, so you didn\u2019t understand why he was being this bitter and petty with the silent treatment.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, though, you had better things to think about. By Friday you had healed up, no longer needing a bandage and your bruises had mostly faded (nothing a little concealer couldn\u2019t fix if needed). You sat in the kitchen with Natasha, Sam and Bucky, who were getting ready for a mission of their own and trying to bribe you to make them food before they went.</p><p>\u201cIf you eat now you\u2019re gonna get a side ache,\u201d you smacked Bucky\u2019s hand away from your sandwich while you cleaned up. \u201cAre you really that desperate for PB&amp;J?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, obviously,\u201d Bucky held his hands up and pouted, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to make you one, maybe you can bribe Nat,\u201d you took a bite of your sandwich, wiggling your eyebrows at him and Sam, who looked offended.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you gonna start getting ready for your date?\u201d Nat shot you a little wink while your face went slack.</p><p>\u201cNatasha!\u201d You said sharply, ignoring all the eyes on you. \u201cI said don\u2019t bring it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, who\u2019s taking you out? Is it Peter?\u201d You choked on your food while Bucky and Sam snickered, making you want to throw something at their heads.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, but no, it\u2019s definitely not him,\u201d you glared at Nat as you took another bite of your sandwich. \u201cIt\u2019s just someone from school, and you guys aren\u2019t my parents, so please chill out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, she\u2019s got an attitude today,\u201d Sam grinned, nudging your arm a bit. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>begging</i> you to shut up now.\u201d</p><p>Natasha cracked a smile and left to get some work done while Bucky and Sam decided to stay and keep annoying you with questions, but after a few minutes luckily (or maybe unluckily) a new voice interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone laughing?\u201d Your frown only deepened when a familiar set of curls was seen peeking over Bucky\u2019s shoulder, his eyes catching yours before quickly moving away. Weird.</p><p>\u201cBet Spider-Kid here is gonna be jealous,\u201d Sam clapped Peter on the shoulders while him and Bucky laughed, Peter\u2019s face turning confused. \u201cHave fun on your date!\u201d</p><p>His face was blank for a minute while Sam and Bucky left chuckling, and you almost thought he looked upset - but then the corner of his mouth turned up. </p><p>\u201cYou have a date?\u201d He gave you a shit-eating grin, \u201cSomeone actually wants to date you?\u201d</p><p>You threw a spoon from the table at him, but he easily caught it, \u201cYes, Parker, someone <i>actually</i> wants to date me. Will you just leave it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it tonight?\u201d He continued, ignoring your request while he tossed the spoon back. \u201cYou should probably not wear Thor pajamas to a date, just a little advice.\u201d</p><p>You swatted his hand away from where he was tugging your Thor themed shorts (you weren\u2019t <i>that</i> embarrassed, and Thor thought they were hilarious). \u201cBack off, idiot, I\u2019m obviously not gonna wear these. And what advice would you know about dating, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He made a face at that, \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t think I\u2019ve dated anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with your rude personality, no,\u201d you missed the slightly hurt look on his face, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you really be going out on a date when you\u2019re still healing?\u201d He blurted out, making you frown.</p><p>\u201cWhy would that matter? I\u2019m not going to be doing anything that would make me move it around?\u201d You looked at him in confusion as his face turned a little red and you scoffed, realizing what he meant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about <i>that</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first date, dude, I wouldn\u2019t be-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is be careful-\u201d</p><p>You held a hand up, \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head as he left, pushing the annoyance away and trying to focus on being excited. Peter watched you leave with a frown, losing the appetite that he had before walking into this conversation.</p><p>He would never admit it to anyone, but the idea of you going on a date\u2026<i>hurt</i>. And when you came down an hour later and he had to see you dressed up and nervous and excited to go out with someone that wasn\u2019t him - it just made him feel worse. He covered those feelings up quickly, giving you a once-over. </p><p>\u201cWow, you can actually look nice!\u201d You shot him a middle finger, pretending you didn\u2019t notice how he had definitely just checked you out.</p><p>\u201cIf I come back and my snacks are gone, I\u2019m coming for you,\u201d you threatened, and he put his hands up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d he mocked, rolling his eyes. \u201cCan you go already? I have the floor to myself tonight and I\u2019d like you to not be in it, as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick,\u201d you muttered, adjusting your jacket a little and hoping he couldn\u2019t tell how nervous you were. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d He mocked your voice, but you were too wound up about the date to respond with something snarky, so you chose to just slam the door behind you.</p><p>-</p><p>They had asked you to meet them at a coffee shop, which you thought was cute - you knew them from school and you hadn\u2019t thought about going out with them, but when they asked, you couldn\u2019t help but get a little excited. It had been ages since you went on a date and maybe\u2026it could help you get over some stupid, definitely unrequited feelings you <i>might</i> have <i>possibly</i> had for a certain boy.</p><p>Not that you would ever admit that to anyone, not even yourself.</p><p>They weren\u2019t there when you arrived, which wasn\u2019t that strange - you came a little bit earlier than you had both planned. You ordered a drink and sat down, trying to relax a little. The coffee shop was cute and there weren\u2019t many people there considering it was later in the day, soft music was playing and workers seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>After a while of fumbling with your hands and not doing much, you checked the time and realized it was past the time they were meant to arrive. You stared at your drink, biting your lip and tapping your feet. It was only ten minutes, that wasn\u2019t too long. They could be stuck in traffic, or held up with something. </p><p>You typed up a text, just offering to get a drink for them if they were running late, giving them the chance to explain but also trying not to be weird and flat out ask if they were still coming. You sent it and just sat and sipped on your drink as you waited, trying to ignore the bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>But ten minutes turned into an hour with no text back and you were getting a little concerned. </p><p>You didn\u2019t want to be weird and stalk their social media to see if they were active, so you found yourself opening instagram and just going through the explore page. Some mutual friends of yours had stories up and you clicked on them to distract yourself, nearly dropping your phone when you realized what you were watching.</p><p>They were at a party, ones that you usually avoided, and you felt a little sick as you watched the video showing the person meant to be here with you, grinding up against other people while loud music played in the background and drunk people made a mess of themselves.</p><p>It was obvious that you were stood up.</p><p>You stared at your phone, your chest tightening at the realization that they were definitely not going to show up. That only left you with the option to go home, or wait here longer and ignore the stares of pity from the workers in hopes that maybe they\u2019ll still come.</p><p>But you weren\u2019t stupid.</p><p>With a sigh, you left a couple dollars on the table and hurried out of there, not wanting to see the looks on their faces. You typed a rather angry text before deciding it wasn\u2019t worth it and shoved your phone away, holding your arms around you while you started your walk home, trying not to feel pathetic.</p><p>You were obviously sad, you could feel the burning rejection in your chest and the tears forming at the edges of your eyes, but the idea of coming home early made you feel sick. It was only Peter there, and you could already imagine the look of glee on his face when he finds out you were stood up. </p><p>Hopefully he would\u2019ve gone to his room or would just ignore you, but you weren\u2019t sure it would be that easy.</p><p>It was quiet when you got back to the compound, and you tried not to make any noise as you got to your floor. You were sniffling a little as you came into the living room, hoping you could sneak past Peter, who was watching something on the tv, but you almost forgot about his spidey senses.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back already?\u201d He asked when he noticed you, sounding a bit annoyed, but that tone quickly dropped when he saw your expression. He jumped up to block you from the hallway, concern taking over any annoyance he might have felt.</p><p>\u201cAre-are you crying?\u201d his voice went soft while you wiped your eyes, and looked down so he couldn\u2019t see your face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you said miserably, sniffing, \u201cCan you move? I want to go to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>All you wanted was to sob pathetically into your pillow but he was just standing there looking like he actually cared about you for once, and that made you break down more. \u00a0</p><p>You were shocked when he pulled you to his chest, his arms snaking around your waist and hugging you, his voice attempting to calm you down. But instead of pulling away, you gripped the back of his shirt with your fingers and held him back while you cried, letting him comfort you.</p><p>You\u2019d never thought in a million years you\u2019d be hugging Peter Parker, but here you were, staining his shirt with your tears and make-up. He didn\u2019t seem to care, surprising you by pressing his lips to your hair and holding you tighter, murmuring sweet words under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said quietly once you calmed down a little, \u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry, I probably look like a mess,\u201d you mumbled, not even sure why you were apologizing to him or why he was even comforting you in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAt least you smell good,\u201d he said flatly, and you couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh at that, giving him a weird look. \u201cThere\u2019s that smile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strange,\u201d you muttered, taking the excuse to step out of his arms, even though you didn\u2019t really want to. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked again, his soft tone making you relax a little. </p><p>\u201cThey never showed up,\u201d you sniffed, still not able to meet his eyes. Peter was the last person you wanted to be this vulnerable in front of. \u201cAnd I saw on instagram that they\u2019re at some party. Maybe you\u2019re right, no one wants to date me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that,\u201d he said quickly, before you even got the words out. \u201cAnyone would be lucky to have you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, wondering who the hell was standing in front of you, because it sure wasn\u2019t Peter. Maybe Loki came back and was pretending to be him, because Peter would never be this kind to you, even if your heart just got stomped on.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d You asked, not caring if it was blunt. \u201cDid you do something bad and now you feel guilty? I swear if you ate my snacks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he chuckled a little, \u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t like seeing you like this. Makes me want to go punch that idiot that stood you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, so you\u2019re the only one allowed to be rude to me?\u201d You scoffed, though the words he said made you feel a little warm inside, even if you hated to admit it. </p><p>Peter stared at the ground for a minute before biting his lip, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>You stared at him blankly, \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood to argue with you when I just got stood up, can we do this another time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue,\u201d he promised, his tone sincere, \u201cI just\u2026I want to explain why I\u2019ve been a dick. And I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Your mouth almost dropped in surprise. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, gesturing to the couch. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You gave him a look, but decided it might as well happen. With a small sigh you wiped your eyes of any last tears or smeared make up and went to plop down on the couch, pulling your legs up while Peter sat across from you. He stared at the ground for a minute, seeming to collect his thoughts while you waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d he finally said, making you raise an eyebrow. \u201cI never have. I was just jealous because when I first got here, you already had everything under control. You were my age but it still felt like you were my superior, and you knew what to do in any situation. I felt stupid, so I acted out in ways that I probably shouldn\u2019t have. </p><p>\"You don\u2019t even need powers to kick my ass,\u201d he continued with a light chuckle, focusing on picking at his fingernails rather than meeting your eyes. \u201cIt bothered me that even with my powers you were still seen as the better fighter. And\u2026I only had my aunt and you had this family with the Avengers that I haven\u2019t really had and\u2026and I guess I was jealous for a few reasons. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think of you as family, you know,\u201d you pretended not to see the blush rising on his cheeks, \u201cTony likes you more than me, you at least have to know that - he\u2019s obvious at playing favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re Nat\u2019s favorite,\u201d he shot back, and you couldn\u2019t help but agree a little with that. </p><p>\u201cMaybe, but she still likes you. They all do. Maybe I was here first, but they see us both as family, and equal members of the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>It went silent for a minute, and you realized that it was probably your turn to explain some things. Peter hadn\u2019t really started the hostility between you two, and you didn\u2019t necessarily either, but it wasn\u2019t one sided by any means.</p><p>\u201cI have a hard time getting along with people, but I also always want people to like me,\u201d you admitted, trying to ignore the intensity of his gaze, \u201cIt took me a while to get close with this team since I\u2019m younger than them. But when you came along it was like they all immediately loved you, you barely had to try - it took me ages for that. I guess I was insecure about it and especially when you didn\u2019t get along with me, I just-I <i>hate</i> when people don\u2019t like me. Guess that\u2019s why tonight was an especially hard blow.\u201d</p><p>You let out a harsh laugh, shaking your head while Peter stared at you for a minute. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry they did that, you seemed really excited,\u201d he finally said quietly, \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Peter, but\u2026I don\u2019t really mind, I wasn\u2019t that interested in them anyway,\u201d you scoffed, \u201cI think I just\u2026I haven\u2019t been on a date in a while? And all the ones I\u2019ve been on have been shitty, and I just - I really want to go on a nice date, you know, with someone who actually <i>wants</i> to be with me, who treats me how I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019s gonna treat you right,\u201d he promised, suddenly very focused on his lap, not really making eye contact. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re closer than you think.\u201d</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, not missing the light blush dusting his cheeks and the way he was sort of avoiding meeting your gaze. His nervous tell was how he tapped his fingers on his knees, biting his lip.</p><p>You were making him nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow close, do you think?\u201d You asked quietly, shifting a little bit so you sat closer to him, but not making it too obvious. His eyes finally met yours and he saw your expression, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to answer. Instead, he carefully slid his hand into yours, maybe a little afraid that you would pull away and hate him again. But instead you let him, even giving his hand a little squeeze.</p><p>\u201cRemember the last time you held my hand?\u201d You said jokingly to ease the tension, and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me, that was the worst day I\u2019ve had since officially becoming an Avenger,\u201d he shook his head, making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWorse day <i>you\u2019ve</i> had? I was the one that was shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought I was gonna lose you,\u201d he responded without thinking, \u201cI was so mad because\u2026because I was scared you were going to be gone and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if anything like that happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared about me like that,\u201d you said, trying to ignore the butterflies in your stomach. </p><p>\u201cI care about you a lot,\u201d he admitted, his eyes searching over your face. \u201cI guess I just have a funny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Peter watched you as he moved his free hand to you, scooting a little closer when you didn\u2019t make any objection. He let his finger trail along your arm, raising goosebumps while he bit his lip, and you knew he was dragging it out on purpose, allowing for you to pull away if you wanted to. His eyes were on your lips, a smirk raising on his own as he leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is beating really fast,\u201d he said, and you tried not to roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou can hear my heart beating?\u201d You asked while he brought his hand up from your arm to cup your face, and you were sure it started beating louder by the way his grin widened. \u201cThat\u2019s not very fair, it gives away how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, m'sure mine\u2019s beating just as much,\u201d he murmured, and he didn\u2019t wait for you to answer before pulling your face to his and kissing you.</p><p>You weren\u2019t exactly shocked, he had definitely been making it obvious that he was about to lay one on you, but you couldn\u2019t help the noise of surprise you made when he pressed his lips against yours. But still, you didn\u2019t hesitate to kiss him back, your lips moving against his and your mind wondering why you spent all that time bickering with him when you could\u2019ve been doing <i>this</i>.</p><p>His nose rubbed yours as he moved closer, and you could feel him smiling a little, just making the moment sweeter even if it made the kiss messier. He hand cupping your cheek moved to the back of your neck while the one holding your hand was moved to your waist. </p><p>He pulled away only to press you back against the couch, the look in his eyes soft before he closed them, connecting your lips again as he leaned over you. You snaked an arm around his neck and let your hand find its way into his curls, your other one resting on the back of his neck while he laid himself against you, resting between your legs.</p><p>You tried not to smile against his mouth, not really sure you believed this was even happening. Were you actually locking lips with the boy you were sure hated your guts? Those thoughts were interrupted when he was quick to slip his tongue into your mouth, surprising you again, but you tilted your head and deepened the kiss, your fingers tugging his hair a little.</p><p>He hummed into your mouth as his hand brushed against your stomach when he went to hold your waist again, and you tried not to wince when he accidentally moved over one of the bruises that still remained from the mission. With some hesitation you made yourself pull back, almost laughing when he followed your lips, pouting a little when you put a hand on his chest to stop him.</p><p>\u201cWe should slow down a little,\u201d you breathed out, trying to ignore the sharp pain in your shoulder and waist that was more evident now that you weren\u2019t distracted by his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to make out until Sam and Bucky walk in and prove them right?\u201d He smirked a little while you smacked him on the chest, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to move around too much, remember?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he scrambled off of you, \u201cI forgot, are-are you okay, I\u2019m so sorry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you chuckled, holding his arms so he didn\u2019t go too far. One of your hands moved to cup his cheek and he shut his eyes, smiling a little as you traced his jawline, brushing your thumb against his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you worry, though.\u201d</p><p>He just grinned and leaned down, giving you a soft kiss while this time avoiding touching you in any way that might hurt you. His curls tickled your face as he moved his lips down your jaw, and you laughed a little as he pressed kisses against your neck, propping an arm up so he didn\u2019t squish you.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019m loving this,\u201d you chuckled, and you could feel him smirking against your throat, \u201cI really think Sam and Bucky walking in on us is a big possibility that I\u2019d rather not face the consequences of right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d He pulled up, still leaning over you, his eyes bright and usually thin lips swollen from all the kissing were pulled into a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want it to leave us?\u201d You countered, letting your fingers trail up his arm while you didn\u2019t quite meet his gaze, choosing instead to focus on his crazy eyebrow or slightly crooked nose or freckles dotting his pink cheeks.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think you could handle it if he didn\u2019t want to be with you after <i>that</i>. He didn\u2019t explicitly say he had feelings for you, what if this was just in the moment? Or he wanted some friends with benefits thing? You couldn\u2019t stand the idea of him suggesting anything like that.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the door slamming open interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice made you both jump apart, you frantically trying to fix your shirt while Peter smoothed down his hair, as if that would really work. \u201cHey, thought you were on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cancelled it,\u201d you said quickly, hoping your mascara wasn\u2019t streaking from your crying earlier. \u201cI was just down here annoying Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Sam rolled his eyes, \u201cSure you were. Night kids, don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do!\u201d</p><p>Instead of leaving with Sam, Bucky threw himself on the couch in between you both, changing the television channel with the remote. \u201cSorry to interrupt your little date, but I didn\u2019t get to watch the game earlier, so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d you scoffed, pushing his face as you got up, making him laugh. You exchanged a glance with Peter, not sure what to do. You almost wanted him to follow you so that you could both talk, but at the same time neither of you wanted to tip Bucky off. The teasing was not worth it. \u201cUm, night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d they both replied, Peter shooting you an apologetic look when Bucky wasn\u2019t looking, but you just gave him a smile and mouthed \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really fine, especially when you went to bed and hoped that maybe he would come knocking on your door, but never did. You didn\u2019t fall asleep for a while, thinking that you were looking into it too much and then wondering if it even happened and if he would just ignore you for the rest of your life (maybe a little dramatic, but you\u2019d had an eventful evening).</p><p>But you did manage to fall asleep, and there was someone knocking on your door in the morning.</p><p>You opened your door to see Peter standing there with a bouquet of flowers and a bright, nervous smile on his face, and you felt stupid for staying up all night thinking he would just ignore you forever.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d take you out on a date,\u201d his face turned a little red, making your lips lift up in a small smile. \u201cWe could go get breakfast and talk and you know, I can show you how you deserve to be treated? If-If you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d you said softly, taking the flowers from him and grinning. \u201cI should probably change out of these Thor pajamas though, right dating expert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could keep them on if you want,\u201d he laughed, wrapping an arm around your waist and pulling you against him, being careful of your shoulder. \u201cI think they\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>Peter pressed a kiss to your lips, and you used your free hand to hold his face so he wouldn\u2019t pull away so quick. He chuckled against your mouth, definitely realizing what you were doing, but not finding that he cared as he just kissed you back, his arm holding you closer.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>You both broke apart to see Bucky standing there with a cup of coffee, a surprised look on his face before he grinned and went back down the hallway. </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d you mumbled, pushing your face into Peter\u2019s chest while he laughed, his face bright red. He put his other arm around you while you also starting laughing, hugging you to his chest while you heard Bucky screaming in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me fifty bucks Sam!\u201d</p>",

I love your scenarios!! I\u2019m going through some endgame withdrawals and was wondering if you could do a bucky or Peter scenario that\u2019s kinda angsty like they make fun of the girl a lot and then she gets stood up for a date and they feel bad and try to comfort her or something like that? Thanks in advance!!</i><br><b>a/n</b>: I kind of went crazy with the request I only used it as a basic guideline sorry lol. this is the longest oneshot I\u2019ve ever written I think lmao but I didn\u2019t want to make it two parts so\u2026yeah. sunburn part one should be out sometime this week (and maybe another oneshot too, we\u2019ll see) hope you guys enjoy! there are no spoilers in this as I am pretending infinity war and endgame never happened :)</p><p><b>I do NOT have a tagslist ~ <a href=\"https://pparkerwrites.tumblr.com/post/170484664302/masterlist\">masterlist</a></b></p><hr><p>You let out a groan as your back slammed against the mat, shutting your eyes. Peter let out a cheer above you and pumped his fist, making you grimace slightly. He smirked down at you while you leaned up on your elbows, glaring at him and trying to catch your breath.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he snickered and offered you a hand but you huffed and swatted it away, getting up on your own. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a sore loser, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Parker,\u201d you muttered, brushing off your pants, \u201cIt\u2019s not an even match when you pull shit like that, I don\u2019t have super powers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said cheekily, making you roll your eyes. </p><p>Natasha pursed her lips and joined you both on the mat, crossing her arms while watching you glare at him. \u201cKid, we said it would be without the super strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was without the strength,\u201d Peter stared at her wide-eyed, his innocent expression making you grit your teeth, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault Y/N can\u2019t take me down normally-\u201d</p><p>You swiped your leg under his and knocked him down, not even caring if it was immature to do so. The look on his face made it worth it, and you put your hands on your hips, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou kinda deserved that,\u201d Nat admitted. </p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cThat was uncalled for,\u201d Peter grunted while you jumped off the mat, going to your water. \u201cI still won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you cheated!\u201d you spat back, resisting the urge to give him a middle finger while he muttered something under his breath, following you to grab a towel and wipe his face. He got a cheeky grin back on and threw the now sweaty towel at you, making you squeal and throw it on the ground. </p><p>\u201cGross, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be an Avenger, and you\u2019re scared of a towel?\u201d He sneered a little, while you glared at him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you two play nice?\u201d Nat sighed, coming up behind you both, \u201cHow are you supposed to have each other\u2019s backs out there if you act like this in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just let him get-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d Natasha interrupted, giving you a stern look. \u201cYou know you wouldn\u2019t actually, and you wouldn\u2019t either, Peter, so don\u2019t speak up. Training can be done now, but we\u2019re going again tomorrow and if you use your strength again Peter, we\u2019re gonna have some problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI <i>said</i> I didn\u2019t-\u201d</p><p>Nat just raised an eyebrow and Peter gave up, grabbing his things with a huff. You started unwrapping your hands, ignoring the angry feeling in your chest as Peter shot you a last dirty look and left the training room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you two,\u201d she said once he was gone, giving you a look, \u201cYou guys would be even better partners if you would just get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s annoying,\u201d you frowned, tossing the empty water bottle in the trash. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s like that with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, boys are mean to girls they like,\u201d she smirked a little and you made a face.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t kindergarten, Nat,\u201d you muttered, \u201cYou sound like Sam.\u201d </p><p>\u201cSam might be on to something,\u201d she teased a little, dodging the towel that you went to smack her with.</p><p>Sam (and sometimes Bucky) liked to joke that you two would be perfect together if you weren\u2019t bickering all the time like an old married couple, and you tried not to let it hurt when Peter made a disgusted face at those comments.</p><p>At one point you were desperate to be friends with him, maybe even more, but that time had clearly passed.</p><p>When Tony told you a new recruit was joining that was your age, you were ecstatic. Being a teenager around a bunch of adults was a bit frustrating at times - you went to school, but for training and missions and whatnot, there was no one else your age. </p><p>Peter had been nice when you first met, you remembered that. But something seemed to click after a while, and suddenly he was getting cocky during sparring and making unnecessary comments about your fighting style. You thought maybe it was jealousy but it was obvious that he was getting along well with the others and sometimes even getting more praise than you did, so you weren\u2019t sure what his deal was.</p><p>The thing you hated most was that Peter got along with <i>everyone</i> - even Bucky, who did his best to avoid the kid after the whole airport incident a few years back. Tony obviously had a favorite (you didn\u2019t really mind it that much, you\u2019d never been close to Tony), Steve and him joked about Queens and Brooklyn, Scott and Clint had pranks with him whenever they came by. You got along with them too, but not like Peter did - he was clearly the preferred trainee around the compound, and you wished it didn\u2019t hurt to realize that.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s never gonna happen,\u201d you said flatly, grabbing your gym bag and swinging it over your shoulder as you walked out. Nat was just a step behind you.</p><p>\u201cYou almost sound upset about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Please</i>, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you get distracted on your mission tonight-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might get distracted when I go after <i>you</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she held her hands up, trying not to smile. \u201cWe\u2019re briefing at six, leaving at seven, make sure you and Peter are ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we will be,\u201d you frowned as she walked away, pointing a finger at you while you made a face.</p><p>A few hours later and you were in the briefing room with Sam, Bucky, Natasha, and Peter. Everyone was in their suits, Peter\u2019s bright red and blue attire standing out against everyone else\u2019s, but he was yet to get a stealth suit made, so it had to do. </p><p>Natasha had a map projected on the table and was pointing out areas for each of you to go, and you weren\u2019t surprised to have her pair you and Peter up, despite the amount of times you both protested. There wasn\u2019t much of a point of arguing against it now - he was going to go where you went, and vice versa. </p><p>\u201cBarnes, Wilson, you two take the second floor, east side. Take the agents out, try and cause a big enough distraction for one of them to call a distress and get the rest of the base to go there. I\u2019ll get the intel on the west side, Y/N and Peter go to the third floor and get into the main office. Both of you keep with your pairs and watch each other\u2019s backs. Sound good?\u201d Natasha looked up at all of you, seeing Bucky and Sam exchange a look.</p><p>\u201cOoh, pairing up the love birds,\u201d Sam joked, making you twitch a little. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you guys were together,\u201d Peter gestured at him and Bucky, making them both stop laughing. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you two!\u201d</p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but giggle at that, missing how Peter grinned and looked a little pleased at the fact that he made you laugh. Natasha just shook her head while Sam and Bucky started bickering.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve retired,\u201d she muttered before smacking her hand on the table, getting everyone to shut up. \u201cI said, does the plan sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d you and Peter responded at the same time, making Bucky snicker. </p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go before you all kill each other.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like we\u2019re in a horror movie and we\u2019re about to get killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>Why</i> would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s just the energy of this place,\u201d Peter muttered, and you gave him a look that basically told him to shut up. </p><p>You were both crouched on an outside platform, waiting for an all clear on when you could enter. Peter had swung you both up to the third floor where no guards were waiting outside, figuring it was the best place to break in and enter when the time called for it. And you usually didn\u2019t like to agree with him, but he was right this time. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the second floor,\u201d Bucky alerted through comms, his voice quiet, \u201cWe\u2019ll signal when it\u2019s clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that,\u201d Nat replied. </p><p>You sighed and shifted a little, the position uncomfortable, especially with Peter so close to you. His suit at least looked comfortable, and he was probably a lot warmer than you - yours was tight and the belt was clunky and you certainly didn\u2019t have a heater, and it was freezing in the cold.</p><p>\u201cStop shivering,\u201d Peter whispered, and you went to smack his arm but he dodged it easily.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Sam said in a rush and you heard yelling and gunshots through the comms. </p><p>Peter swung up to the window and kicked through it with his foot, not even needing to try hard for it to break. He offered you a hand and pulled you up, swiping some broken glass out of the way. You crawled in first, nearly falling forward but he managed to wrap an arm around your waist and catch you.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d you muttered, both of you looking down and seeing how far the ground was. </p><p>\u201cCareful next time,\u201d he muttered, startling you by sticking your waist with a web and pushing you down. You held the web tight and managed not to scream as he grabbed the end of it before you hit the floor, cackling above you.</p><p>\u201cUncalled for,\u201d you muttered, hoping he couldn\u2019t hear how loud your heart was beating. \u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was fun,\u201d he dropped down next to you, his masked eye winking while you tried to resist the urge to attack him. </p><p>\u201cWhatever, don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>You both fell into a silence as you turned on a flashlight, not entirely sure why the lights were off, but not having enough time to question it. The comms were like background noise in your ears and you could hear Sam and Bucky causing a ruckus on the floor below, hopefully creating enough of a distraction for no one to come find you both.</p><p>\u201cSeems like we have the whole base in here,\u201d Bucky said through the comms, \u201cYou guys should be clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone here,\u201d Natasha replied, \u201cY/N, Peter, you guys have been silent for a while, all good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably making out in a closet,\u201d Sam chuckled amongst the fighting, and you quickly rolled your eyes.</p><p>\u201cFunny how the kids are acting more mature than the adults,\u201d you snapped over the comms, missing how Peter cracked a smile - not that you would see it through the mask anyway. \u201cAre you even doing your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, she\u2019s getting attitude,\u201d Bucky whistled, \u201cBetter watch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Natasha said sternly, making you relax a bit, \u201cWe can make jokes later, we need to focus on getting the intel. Go off comms unless we have a problem, Sam let us know when you two are done with the agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma'am,\u201d Sam responded, but you could still hear the smirk in his voice, \u201cPeter, keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>You heard the comms click off and you muttered under your breath, while Peter was glad he was wearing the mask so you couldn\u2019t see how red the comments were making him. Finally you both came across the door, Peter putting an arm out to keep you from moving.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he put a hand to his mask, probably using some fancy update Stark had given him to look through and make sure no one was there. \u201cAlright, all clear.\u201d</p><p>You jiggled the handle, frowning as you dropped your hand. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>His mask shifted into what you assumed was a smirk, and he simply grabbed the handle and snapped it off, pushing the door open. He bowed and held his arm out to let you walk first, making you frown in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cShow off,\u201d you muttered, fumbling to grab the flash drive from your pocket as you hurried to the computer. Peter just snorted and shut the door behind you, putting a chair up to block it.</p><p>You typed quickly on the computer while Peter stood next to you, his fingers twitching with impatience. There were several passwords that might have worked, and it was starting to annoy the both of you when it kept blocking you out.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go faster?\u201d He muttered, and you shot him a look. </p><p>\u201cDo <i>you</i> want to do it?\u201d</p><p>He just huffed and crossed his arms, looking around the room. It was mostly empty aside from some filing cabinets and chairs, but it was pretty large for just an office. You bit your lip as you finally managed to log in and start downloading the files. </p><p>\u201cThis place is creepy,\u201d Peter said quietly, bouncing on his feet a little. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to make conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s distracting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever.\u201d</p><p>You just rolled your eyes as you finished the code, ignoring how he kept fidgeting around. </p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d you pulled the drive out, sticking it in your belt and you began wiping the computer of any evidence that you both had been there.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d Peter muttered, and you went to snap back at him but suddenly you both heard voices from outside the room.</p><p>The door burst open despite the chair blocking it and Peter quickly yanked you down behind the desk. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t my senses go off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re too busy annoying me and it\u2019s distracting you,\u201d you whispered back, ignoring his masked eyes squinting at you in what you assumed was a dirty look.</p><p>You could both hear multiple people come in, and you looked at Peter while he listened. His enhanced hearing often helped him figure out how many people were in the room or even where they were. He held up seven fingers, making you frown a little. Someone was definitely tipped off. With a deep breath, you adjusted your suit and nodded to him. </p><p>Despite how often you both argued, you and Peter were good partners. You could fight together without really needing to verbally communicate, and you could almost always predict each other\u2019s moves. Missions with him got easier over time, even when the bickering was more frequent. </p><p>He jumped up first while you snuck to the side, waiting for him to cause a big enough distraction before you came in. You watched him web two guys and bring their heads together, wincing as they both crumpled to the floor. </p><p>Once the focus was on him, you came up behind the nearest guy and placed your hands on his shoulders, kicking the backs on his knees in and forcing him to kneel and fall forward. A gun shot rang out and you almost lost focus from the guy you were fighting by looking up in a panic, only to see Peter pulling the gun from one of the men\u2019s hands and webbing it to the ceiling where no one could reach. You relaxed a little knowing he wasn\u2019t shot.</p><p>You quickly grabbed the gun from the guy you were trying to force to the ground, hitting his head with the butt of it and knocking him out. The gun was quickly knocked out of your hands by another guy and you struggled against him, trying not to get distracted watching Peter at the same time.</p><p>He was handling two guys at once, which you thought was a little unfair, even with his super strength. You twisted yourself around and managed to get your guy around the neck, but he was smart and fell back, crushing you under him. With a wince, you managed to push him off of you and roll up, glaring as he stood up again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate to start fighting you again, clearly having the upper hand. You hated on missions, how easy it was for Peter to just take down several guys with no issue, while you had to struggle so hard not to get beat in - having super powers must\u2019ve been nice. You took a hit to the stomach and fell to your knees, rolling out of the way as he aimed a kick for you, not sure how much more you could take. This guy was bigger than anyone you\u2019d fought before. </p><p>You groaned as he pulled his arm back to hit you again, but a web stuck to it and yanked him back, his face going right into Peter\u2019s fist. His nose crunched and the sound of it breaking made you cringe as he crumpled to the ground, knocked out. It almost shocked you - Peter usually held back on hurting people that bad. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he muttered as he came over to you, holding his hand out for you to take. He was surprised when you took it, letting him help you up while you tried to ignore the pain from that guy gut punching you.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d you tried not to sound too bitter, snatching your hand back from him when you realized he was still holding it. \u201cThat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so,\u201d Peter moved around to make sure they were all out while you stared down at the guy, trying not to feel annoyed at how Peter could take him out with one punch, while you struggled with him for several minutes.</p><p>You nudged him with your shoe, relieved to see he was knocked out even if it was Peter who did it. He put his hands on his hips as he came back toward you, stepping over a few of the knocked out men.</p><p>\u201cYour spidey senses working now?\u201d You asked sarcastically, still out of breath as you held a hand to your side, feeling the ache from the punches and kicks.</p><p>Peter started speaking harshly to you but you weren\u2019t listening, your eyes focusing behind him to see a man hiding behind a desk you had both missed raise his gun at Peter\u2019s back, right where his heart was.</p><p>Your eyes widened and without thinking you yanked him around, letting the bullet catch you in the back of your shoulder. The pain made you collapse against Peter as you cried out, barely hearing his panicked voice asking what happened.</p><p>Peter finally caught sight of the guy angrily smacking his gun, clearly having some sort of issue with it, and didn\u2019t hesitate to shoot a web at him, using the taser webs that Karen always suggested but he usually tried to avoid. The guy dropped the gun and fell to the floor, the electricity knocking him out while Peter bent down next to you.</p><p>\u201c<i>Why</i> did you do that?\u201d He asked in a panicked tone, kneeling down as he ripped his mask off. His face was blurry in your vision, even when he put his hands on your face and tried to make you look at him. \u201cY/N, stay with me, come on-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d you hissed out, gripping his wrist probably too tight, but he didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart, I know, it\u2019ll be okay they\u2019re on their way,\u201d he put a hand up to his ear, tapping his comms while the other one still held your face. \u201cNatasha, you need to get here <i>now</i>. She\u2019s-she\u2019s been shot, someone, please-\u201d</p><p>You were definitely out of it if you were hallucinating Peter being this soft with you, right? Nat\u2019s voice was in your comms but you couldn\u2019t hear her, the only thing you could feel was your shoulder wound and Peter holding you, trying to keep you awake, but your eyes were starting to roll back.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey come on, I got you,\u201d Peter lifted you up carefully, avoiding your wound, \u201cPlease don\u2019t pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d you breathed out, not able to help it as your vision went dark, Peter\u2019s panicked tone trying to keep you awake fading out, and you blacked out.</p><p>-</p><p>The first thing you felt was the obvious sharp pain in your shoulder, the rest of your body having small aches and pressures. You could tell that you were in a hospital and it made you scrunch up your nose, hating the smell. </p><p>\u201cY/N?\u201d You heard a soft voice ask, feeling fingers tuck your hair behind your ear and the quiet creak of a chair moving. \u201cYou up?\u201d </p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d You barely opened your eyes, your sight a little blurry as you tried to focus on who was sitting there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d you blinked and saw Peter next to you, a relieved smile on his face that made you confused. He never smiled genuinely at you. \u201cI almost thought you weren\u2019t gonna wake up, you-you really scared m-us! You really scared <i>us</i>.\u201d</p><p>He looked exhausted, his hair all messed up and the bags under his eyes prevalent. You were confused by the pressure in your hand until you looked down, seeing how he was holding it in both of his tightly. </p><p>\u201cAre you holding my hand? Did you think I died or something?\u201d You mumbled with a little smirk, but his face turned hard, clearly not amused by your teasing as he dropped your hand. </p><p>\u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d You frowned, not liking the sudden hostility in his tone compared to how sweet he sounded when you woke up. Dumb of you to think <i>that</i> would last.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how stupid that was? If he had shot you somewhere else you could be dead, I would\u2019ve been the reason you died and-\u201d Peter kept raising his voice, nearly yelling as he told you how idiotic you were being when <i>you</i> saved <i>his</i> life, which was starting to piss you off, considering you literally just woke up. </p><p>\u201cWhat, are you mad I stole your spotlight or something? Or are you upset that <i>I</i> saved your life? Which one is it?\u201d You interrupted, starting to feel the ache in your shoulder that was only making you angrier. <br></p><p>He stared at you blankly for a minute, and you just glared back. It was obvious he had a lot more to say and you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to hear it. You had never seen him this upset about something before.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think that\u2019s what this is about?\u201d He asked quietly, and his tone somehow seemed angrier than when he was yelling. \u201cYou think I\u2019m mad because I\u2019m jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would you be upset?\u201d You said, gritting your teeth a little. \u201cJust admit that\u2019s the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m mad because you got <i>hurt</i>?\u201d He snapped, tugging a hand through his hair, \u201cBecause I saw you get shot and you were bleeding out and I didn\u2019t know where you had been hit and I didn\u2019t know if you were going to die and it would have been my fault? Did you not think that maybe <i>that\u2019s</i> why I was mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you care about me,\u201d you scoffed, but you remembered the moments before you passed out. You remembered his hands holding you and calling you \u201csweetheart\u201d and speaking softly to you, the panic on his face- </p><p>Whatever. It was just in the moment.</p><p>\u201cI care about you doing reckless shit that could get you killed. You could\u2019ve <i>died</i>, Y/N, do you not realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine was just a shoulder wound, <i>you</i> would\u2019ve died! What was I supposed to do, just let him shoot you?\u201d You asked harshly, accidentally moving your shoulder too much. The sharp pain had you wince, putting a hand on your shoulder and gritting your teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked quickly, getting up and letting his hands hover a bit, not sure what to do. It was almost funny how quick his mood changed. \u201cShould I get the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d you muttered, not sure if you were enjoying how weird he was being. The back and forth between him pissing you off and suddenly being nice was giving you whiplash. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t take it you would have, and it would\u2019ve hit you by your chest and you would\u2019ve died. I can handle a shoulder wound, you can\u2019t handle one to the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can heal fast,\u201d he said flatly, sounding annoyed again. \u201cI would\u2019ve been fast enough to dodge it, anyway, it never would\u2019ve hit me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t even know it was coming!\u201d You cried out, resisting the urge to raise your arms in disbelief, \u201cYou asked me what happened, you didn\u2019t even realize someone was shooting at you, Peter! You know that, why can\u2019t you just admit that I\u2019m right?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, but then your door opened, Natasha peeking her head in. \u201cHey, you\u2019re up. Parker, can I have a minute with her?\u201d</p><p>He shot you an angry look before stomping out, not saying anything to Natasha when he stormed by. She just raised her eyebrows and shut the door, giving you a quick look before taking the seat he was in.</p><p>\u201cHe was in here the whole time,\u201d Nat said with a little smirk, and you felt your cheeks heat up. \u201cWouldn\u2019t move from that chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably only did that so he could yell at me the second I woke up,\u201d you muttered, carefully crossing your arms. </p><p>\u201cY/N, you should\u2019ve seen how scared he was when he brought you back,\u201d she ignored what you said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him that worried. And don\u2019t act like I didn\u2019t see him holding your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d You changed the subject, knowing she wouldn\u2019t be quiet otherwise. </p><p>\u201cJust a day,\u201d she sighed, leaning back in her chair. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. I\u2019m glad to know that you guys have each other\u2019s backs, that was obviously shown but\u2026try not to get shot again. I don\u2019t need that on my conscious.\u201d </p><p>You smiled a little, \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. What about the flash drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect work, as usual,\u201d she complimented, making you feel a bit better, \u201cWe got the intel and no one else was hurt besides you. Which reminds me, you\u2019re on bed rest for a week minimum, and no training or anything crazy until your wound is healed, got it?\u201d</p><p>You wanted to argue, but even you couldn\u2019t be that stubborn. The bullet hole was starting to ache even more now that you had been awake for a while, and you could still feel the bruising from where you had been fighting. </p><p>\u201cCan I still go to my date on Friday?\u201d You asked, ignoring her little smirk.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be healed up enough by then. Gotta say I\u2019m a little disappointed it isn\u2019t with Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust think you two would be cute, that\u2019s all,\u201d she poked your nose, and you swatted her hand away while she laughed. \u201cBut yes, you can go. Just be safe, and you know what to do if they start acting like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself,\u201d you promised, \u201cNow can I please get something to eat? I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>-</p><p>You were allowed out of the hospital bed that night, much to your relief. You were tired enough to go to bed, hoping to avoid Peter on your shared floor - luckily he seemed to have gone home or something, because he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Training for you was postponed until you got better, but you still attended sessions with Natasha and Peter so you could watch and listen to tips she gave him. </p><p>Peter didn\u2019t speak to you, which was unusual. He might\u2019ve not liked you, but he tended to go out of his way to make sure you were aware of that - snarky comments, sarcastic quips, whatever it was that made your blood boil. Now it was like radio silence.</p><p>You figured he was still mad about your argument, which still made no sense to you. It\u2019s not like you expected him to thank you or anything, but he was acting way too angry about it - it was you who got hurt, so you didn\u2019t understand why he was being this bitter and petty with the silent treatment.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, though, you had better things to think about. By Friday you had healed up, no longer needing a bandage and your bruises had mostly faded (nothing a little concealer couldn\u2019t fix if needed). You sat in the kitchen with Natasha, Sam and Bucky, who were getting ready for a mission of their own and trying to bribe you to make them food before they went.</p><p>\u201cIf you eat now you\u2019re gonna get a side ache,\u201d you smacked Bucky\u2019s hand away from your sandwich while you cleaned up. \u201cAre you really that desperate for PB&amp;J?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, obviously,\u201d Bucky held his hands up and pouted, \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to make you one, maybe you can bribe Nat,\u201d you took a bite of your sandwich, wiggling your eyebrows at him and Sam, who looked offended.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you gonna start getting ready for your date?\u201d Nat shot you a little wink while your face went slack.</p><p>\u201cNatasha!\u201d You said sharply, ignoring all the eyes on you. \u201cI said don\u2019t bring it up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, who\u2019s taking you out? Is it Peter?\u201d You choked on your food while Bucky and Sam snickered, making you want to throw something at their heads.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, but no, it\u2019s definitely not him,\u201d you glared at Nat as you took another bite of your sandwich. \u201cIt\u2019s just someone from school, and you guys aren\u2019t my parents, so please chill out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, she\u2019s got an attitude today,\u201d Sam grinned, nudging your arm a bit. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>begging</i> you to shut up now.\u201d</p><p>Natasha cracked a smile and left to get some work done while Bucky and Sam decided to stay and keep annoying you with questions, but after a few minutes luckily (or maybe unluckily) a new voice interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everyone laughing?\u201d Your frown only deepened when a familiar set of curls was seen peeking over Bucky\u2019s shoulder, his eyes catching yours before quickly moving away. Weird.</p><p>\u201cBet Spider-Kid here is gonna be jealous,\u201d Sam clapped Peter on the shoulders while him and Bucky laughed, Peter\u2019s face turning confused. \u201cHave fun on your date!\u201d</p><p>His face was blank for a minute while Sam and Bucky left chuckling, and you almost thought he looked upset - but then the corner of his mouth turned up. </p><p>\u201cYou have a date?\u201d He gave you a shit-eating grin, \u201cSomeone actually wants to date you?\u201d</p><p>You threw a spoon from the table at him, but he easily caught it, \u201cYes, Parker, someone <i>actually</i> wants to date me. Will you just leave it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it tonight?\u201d He continued, ignoring your request while he tossed the spoon back. \u201cYou should probably not wear Thor pajamas to a date, just a little advice.\u201d</p><p>You swatted his hand away from where he was tugging your Thor themed shorts (you weren\u2019t <i>that</i> embarrassed, and Thor thought they were hilarious). \u201cBack off, idiot, I\u2019m obviously not gonna wear these. And what advice would you know about dating, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He made a face at that, \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t think I\u2019ve dated anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with your rude personality, no,\u201d you missed the slightly hurt look on his face, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get ready now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you really be going out on a date when you\u2019re still healing?\u201d He blurted out, making you frown.</p><p>\u201cWhy would that matter? I\u2019m not going to be doing anything that would make me move it around?\u201d You looked at him in confusion as his face turned a little red and you scoffed, realizing what he meant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about <i>that</i>-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a first date, dude, I wouldn\u2019t be-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is be careful-\u201d</p><p>You held a hand up, \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>You shook your head as he left, pushing the annoyance away and trying to focus on being excited. Peter watched you leave with a frown, losing the appetite that he had before walking into this conversation.</p><p>He would never admit it to anyone, but the idea of you going on a date\u2026<i>hurt</i>. And when you came down an hour later and he had to see you dressed up and nervous and excited to go out with someone that wasn\u2019t him - it just made him feel worse. He covered those feelings up quickly, giving you a once-over. </p><p>\u201cWow, you can actually look nice!\u201d You shot him a middle finger, pretending you didn\u2019t notice how he had definitely just checked you out.</p><p>\u201cIf I come back and my snacks are gone, I\u2019m coming for you,\u201d you threatened, and he put his hands up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d he mocked, rolling his eyes. \u201cCan you go already? I have the floor to myself tonight and I\u2019d like you to not be in it, as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick,\u201d you muttered, adjusting your jacket a little and hoping he couldn\u2019t tell how nervous you were. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d He mocked your voice, but you were too wound up about the date to respond with something snarky, so you chose to just slam the door behind you.</p><p>-</p><p>They had asked you to meet them at a coffee shop, which you thought was cute - you knew them from school and you hadn\u2019t thought about going out with them, but when they asked, you couldn\u2019t help but get a little excited. It had been ages since you went on a date and maybe\u2026it could help you get over some stupid, definitely unrequited feelings you <i>might</i> have <i>possibly</i> had for a certain boy.</p><p>Not that you would ever admit that to anyone, not even yourself.</p><p>They weren\u2019t there when you arrived, which wasn\u2019t that strange - you came a little bit earlier than you had both planned. You ordered a drink and sat down, trying to relax a little. The coffee shop was cute and there weren\u2019t many people there considering it was later in the day, soft music was playing and workers seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>After a while of fumbling with your hands and not doing much, you checked the time and realized it was past the time they were meant to arrive. You stared at your drink, biting your lip and tapping your feet. It was only ten minutes, that wasn\u2019t too long. They could be stuck in traffic, or held up with something. </p><p>You typed up a text, just offering to get a drink for them if they were running late, giving them the chance to explain but also trying not to be weird and flat out ask if they were still coming. You sent it and just sat and sipped on your drink as you waited, trying to ignore the bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>But ten minutes turned into an hour with no text back and you were getting a little concerned. </p><p>You didn\u2019t want to be weird and stalk their social media to see if they were active, so you found yourself opening instagram and just going through the explore page. Some mutual friends of yours had stories up and you clicked on them to distract yourself, nearly dropping your phone when you realized what you were watching.</p><p>They were at a party, ones that you usually avoided, and you felt a little sick as you watched the video showing the person meant to be here with you, grinding up against other people while loud music played in the background and drunk people made a mess of themselves.</p><p>It was obvious that you were stood up.</p><p>You stared at your phone, your chest tightening at the realization that they were definitely not going to show up. That only left you with the option to go home, or wait here longer and ignore the stares of pity from the workers in hopes that maybe they\u2019ll still come.</p><p>But you weren\u2019t stupid.</p><p>With a sigh, you left a couple dollars on the table and hurried out of there, not wanting to see the looks on their faces. You typed a rather angry text before deciding it wasn\u2019t worth it and shoved your phone away, holding your arms around you while you started your walk home, trying not to feel pathetic.</p><p>You were obviously sad, you could feel the burning rejection in your chest and the tears forming at the edges of your eyes, but the idea of coming home early made you feel sick. It was only Peter there, and you could already imagine the look of glee on his face when he finds out you were stood up. </p><p>Hopefully he would\u2019ve gone to his room or would just ignore you, but you weren\u2019t sure it would be that easy.</p><p>It was quiet when you got back to the compound, and you tried not to make any noise as you got to your floor. You were sniffling a little as you came into the living room, hoping you could sneak past Peter, who was watching something on the tv, but you almost forgot about his spidey senses.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back already?\u201d He asked when he noticed you, sounding a bit annoyed, but that tone quickly dropped when he saw your expression. He jumped up to block you from the hallway, concern taking over any annoyance he might have felt.</p><p>\u201cAre-are you crying?\u201d his voice went soft while you wiped your eyes, and looked down so he couldn\u2019t see your face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d you said miserably, sniffing, \u201cCan you move? I want to go to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>All you wanted was to sob pathetically into your pillow but he was just standing there looking like he actually cared about you for once, and that made you break down more. \u00a0</p><p>You were shocked when he pulled you to his chest, his arms snaking around your waist and hugging you, his voice attempting to calm you down. But instead of pulling away, you gripped the back of his shirt with your fingers and held him back while you cried, letting him comfort you.</p><p>You\u2019d never thought in a million years you\u2019d be hugging Peter Parker, but here you were, staining his shirt with your tears and make-up. He didn\u2019t seem to care, surprising you by pressing his lips to your hair and holding you tighter, murmuring sweet words under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he said quietly once you calmed down a little, \u201cYou okay?\u201d </p><p>\u201cSorry, I probably look like a mess,\u201d you mumbled, not even sure why you were apologizing to him or why he was even comforting you in the first place.</p><p>\u201cAt least you smell good,\u201d he said flatly, and you couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh at that, giving him a weird look. \u201cThere\u2019s that smile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strange,\u201d you muttered, taking the excuse to step out of his arms, even though you didn\u2019t really want to. </p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter asked again, his soft tone making you relax a little. </p><p>\u201cThey never showed up,\u201d you sniffed, still not able to meet his eyes. Peter was the last person you wanted to be this vulnerable in front of. \u201cAnd I saw on instagram that they\u2019re at some party. Maybe you\u2019re right, no one wants to date me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that,\u201d he said quickly, before you even got the words out. \u201cAnyone would be lucky to have you, Y/N.\u201d</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, wondering who the hell was standing in front of you, because it sure wasn\u2019t Peter. Maybe Loki came back and was pretending to be him, because Peter would never be this kind to you, even if your heart just got stomped on.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d You asked, not caring if it was blunt. \u201cDid you do something bad and now you feel guilty? I swear if you ate my snacks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he chuckled a little, \u201cI just\u2026I don\u2019t like seeing you like this. Makes me want to go punch that idiot that stood you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, so you\u2019re the only one allowed to be rude to me?\u201d You scoffed, though the words he said made you feel a little warm inside, even if you hated to admit it. </p><p>Peter stared at the ground for a minute before biting his lip, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>You stared at him blankly, \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood to argue with you when I just got stood up, can we do this another time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue,\u201d he promised, his tone sincere, \u201cI just\u2026I want to explain why I\u2019ve been a dick. And I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Your mouth almost dropped in surprise. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, gesturing to the couch. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>You gave him a look, but decided it might as well happen. With a small sigh you wiped your eyes of any last tears or smeared make up and went to plop down on the couch, pulling your legs up while Peter sat across from you. He stared at the ground for a minute, seeming to collect his thoughts while you waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d he finally said, making you raise an eyebrow. \u201cI never have. I was just jealous because when I first got here, you already had everything under control. You were my age but it still felt like you were my superior, and you knew what to do in any situation. I felt stupid, so I acted out in ways that I probably shouldn\u2019t have. </p><p>\"You don\u2019t even need powers to kick my ass,\u201d he continued with a light chuckle, focusing on picking at his fingernails rather than meeting your eyes. \u201cIt bothered me that even with my powers you were still seen as the better fighter. And\u2026I only had my aunt and you had this family with the Avengers that I haven\u2019t really had and\u2026and I guess I was jealous for a few reasons. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think of you as family, you know,\u201d you pretended not to see the blush rising on his cheeks, \u201cTony likes you more than me, you at least have to know that - he\u2019s obvious at playing favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re Nat\u2019s favorite,\u201d he shot back, and you couldn\u2019t help but agree a little with that. </p><p>\u201cMaybe, but she still likes you. They all do. Maybe I was here first, but they see us both as family, and equal members of the Avengers.\u201d</p><p>It went silent for a minute, and you realized that it was probably your turn to explain some things. Peter hadn\u2019t really started the hostility between you two, and you didn\u2019t necessarily either, but it wasn\u2019t one sided by any means.</p><p>\u201cI have a hard time getting along with people, but I also always want people to like me,\u201d you admitted, trying to ignore the intensity of his gaze, \u201cIt took me a while to get close with this team since I\u2019m younger than them. But when you came along it was like they all immediately loved you, you barely had to try - it took me ages for that. I guess I was insecure about it and especially when you didn\u2019t get along with me, I just-I <i>hate</i> when people don\u2019t like me. Guess that\u2019s why tonight was an especially hard blow.\u201d</p><p>You let out a harsh laugh, shaking your head while Peter stared at you for a minute. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry they did that, you seemed really excited,\u201d he finally said quietly, \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Peter, but\u2026I don\u2019t really mind, I wasn\u2019t that interested in them anyway,\u201d you scoffed, \u201cI think I just\u2026I haven\u2019t been on a date in a while? And all the ones I\u2019ve been on have been shitty, and I just - I really want to go on a nice date, you know, with someone who actually <i>wants</i> to be with me, who treats me how I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019s gonna treat you right,\u201d he promised, suddenly very focused on his lap, not really making eye contact. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re closer than you think.\u201d</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, not missing the light blush dusting his cheeks and the way he was sort of avoiding meeting your gaze. His nervous tell was how he tapped his fingers on his knees, biting his lip.</p><p>You were making him nervous.</p><p>\u201cHow close, do you think?\u201d You asked quietly, shifting a little bit so you sat closer to him, but not making it too obvious. His eyes finally met yours and he saw your expression, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to answer. Instead, he carefully slid his hand into yours, maybe a little afraid that you would pull away and hate him again. But instead you let him, even giving his hand a little squeeze.</p><p>\u201cRemember the last time you held my hand?\u201d You said jokingly to ease the tension, and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me, that was the worst day I\u2019ve had since officially becoming an Avenger,\u201d he shook his head, making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWorse day <i>you\u2019ve</i> had? I was the one that was shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought I was gonna lose you,\u201d he responded without thinking, \u201cI was so mad because\u2026because I was scared you were going to be gone and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if anything like that happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared about me like that,\u201d you said, trying to ignore the butterflies in your stomach. </p><p>\u201cI care about you a lot,\u201d he admitted, his eyes searching over your face. \u201cI guess I just have a funny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Peter watched you as he moved his free hand to you, scooting a little closer when you didn\u2019t make any objection. He let his finger trail along your arm, raising goosebumps while he bit his lip, and you knew he was dragging it out on purpose, allowing for you to pull away if you wanted to. His eyes were on your lips, a smirk raising on his own as he leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is beating really fast,\u201d he said, and you tried not to roll your eyes. </p><p>\u201cYou can hear my heart beating?\u201d You asked while he brought his hand up from your arm to cup your face, and you were sure it started beating louder by the way his grin widened. \u201cThat\u2019s not very fair, it gives away how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, m'sure mine\u2019s beating just as much,\u201d he murmured, and he didn\u2019t wait for you to answer before pulling your face to his and kissing you.</p><p>You weren\u2019t exactly shocked, he had definitely been making it obvious that he was about to lay one on you, but you couldn\u2019t help the noise of surprise you made when he pressed his lips against yours. But still, you didn\u2019t hesitate to kiss him back, your lips moving against his and your mind wondering why you spent all that time bickering with him when you could\u2019ve been doing <i>this</i>.</p><p>His nose rubbed yours as he moved closer, and you could feel him smiling a little, just making the moment sweeter even if it made the kiss messier. He hand cupping your cheek moved to the back of your neck while the one holding your hand was moved to your waist. </p><p>He pulled away only to press you back against the couch, the look in his eyes soft before he closed them, connecting your lips again as he leaned over you. You snaked an arm around his neck and let your hand find its way into his curls, your other one resting on the back of his neck while he laid himself against you, resting between your legs.</p><p>You tried not to smile against his mouth, not really sure you believed this was even happening. Were you actually locking lips with the boy you were sure hated your guts? Those thoughts were interrupted when he was quick to slip his tongue into your mouth, surprising you again, but you tilted your head and deepened the kiss, your fingers tugging his hair a little.</p><p>He hummed into your mouth as his hand brushed against your stomach when he went to hold your waist again, and you tried not to wince when he accidentally moved over one of the bruises that still remained from the mission. With some hesitation you made yourself pull back, almost laughing when he followed your lips, pouting a little when you put a hand on his chest to stop him.</p><p>\u201cWe should slow down a little,\u201d you breathed out, trying to ignore the sharp pain in your shoulder and waist that was more evident now that you weren\u2019t distracted by his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want to make out until Sam and Bucky walk in and prove them right?\u201d He smirked a little while you smacked him on the chest, laughing.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to move around too much, remember?\u201d </p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d he scrambled off of you, \u201cI forgot, are-are you okay, I\u2019m so sorry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d you chuckled, holding his arms so he didn\u2019t go too far. One of your hands moved to cup his cheek and he shut his eyes, smiling a little as you traced his jawline, brushing your thumb against his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re cute when you worry, though.\u201d</p><p>He just grinned and leaned down, giving you a soft kiss while this time avoiding touching you in any way that might hurt you. His curls tickled your face as he moved his lips down your jaw, and you laughed a little as he pressed kisses against your neck, propping an arm up so he didn\u2019t squish you.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019m loving this,\u201d you chuckled, and you could feel him smirking against your throat, \u201cI really think Sam and Bucky walking in on us is a big possibility that I\u2019d rather not face the consequences of right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d He pulled up, still leaning over you, his eyes bright and usually thin lips swollen from all the kissing were pulled into a lazy smile.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want it to leave us?\u201d You countered, letting your fingers trail up his arm while you didn\u2019t quite meet his gaze, choosing instead to focus on his crazy eyebrow or slightly crooked nose or freckles dotting his pink cheeks.</p><p>You didn\u2019t think you could handle it if he didn\u2019t want to be with you after <i>that</i>. He didn\u2019t explicitly say he had feelings for you, what if this was just in the moment? Or he wanted some friends with benefits thing? You couldn\u2019t stand the idea of him suggesting anything like that.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the door slamming open interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back!\u201d Bucky\u2019s voice made you both jump apart, you frantically trying to fix your shirt while Peter smoothed down his hair, as if that would really work. \u201cHey, thought you were on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cancelled it,\u201d you said quickly, hoping your mascara wasn\u2019t streaking from your crying earlier. \u201cI was just down here annoying Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Sam rolled his eyes, \u201cSure you were. Night kids, don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do!\u201d</p><p>Instead of leaving with Sam, Bucky threw himself on the couch in between you both, changing the television channel with the remote. \u201cSorry to interrupt your little date, but I didn\u2019t get to watch the game earlier, so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d you scoffed, pushing his face as you got up, making him laugh. You exchanged a glance with Peter, not sure what to do. You almost wanted him to follow you so that you could both talk, but at the same time neither of you wanted to tip Bucky off. The teasing was not worth it. \u201cUm, night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d they both replied, Peter shooting you an apologetic look when Bucky wasn\u2019t looking, but you just gave him a smile and mouthed \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really fine, especially when you went to bed and hoped that maybe he would come knocking on your door, but never did. You didn\u2019t fall asleep for a while, thinking that you were looking into it too much and then wondering if it even happened and if he would just ignore you for the rest of your life (maybe a little dramatic, but you\u2019d had an eventful evening).</p><p>But you did manage to fall asleep, and there was someone knocking on your door in the morning.</p><p>You opened your door to see Peter standing there with a bouquet of flowers and a bright, nervous smile on his face, and you felt stupid for staying up all night thinking he would just ignore you forever.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d take you out on a date,\u201d his face turned a little red, making your lips lift up in a small smile. \u201cWe could go get breakfast and talk and you know, I can show you how you deserve to be treated? If-If you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d you said softly, taking the flowers from him and grinning. \u201cI should probably change out of these Thor pajamas though, right dating expert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could keep them on if you want,\u201d he laughed, wrapping an arm around your waist and pulling you against him, being careful of your shoulder. \u201cI think they\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>Peter pressed a kiss to your lips, and you used your free hand to hold his face so he wouldn\u2019t pull away so quick. He chuckled against your mouth, definitely realizing what you were doing, but not finding that he cared as he just kissed you back, his arm holding you closer.</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>You both broke apart to see Bucky standing there with a cup of coffee, a surprised look on his face before he grinned and went back down the hallway. </p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d you mumbled, pushing your face into Peter\u2019s chest while he laughed, his face bright red. He put his other arm around you while you also starting laughing, hugging you to his chest while you heard Bucky screaming in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me fifty bucks Sam!\u201d</p>",

Peter let out a cheer above you and pumped his fist, making you grimace slightly. He smirked down at you while you leaned up on your elbows, glaring at him and trying to catch your breath.</p><p>&ldquo;Nice try,&rdquo; he snickered and offered you a hand but you huffed and swatted it away, getting up on your own. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a sore loser, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut up, Parker,&rdquo; you muttered, brushing off your pants, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an even match when you pull shit like that, I don&rsquo;t have super powers!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said cheekily, making you roll your eyes. </p><p>Natasha pursed her lips and joined you both on the mat, crossing her arms while watching you glare at him. &ldquo;Kid, we said it would be without the super strength.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was without the strength,&rdquo; Peter stared at her wide-eyed, his innocent expression making you grit your teeth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault Y/N can&rsquo;t take me down normally-&rdquo;</p><p>You swiped your leg under his and knocked him down, not even caring if it was immature to do so. The look on his face made it worth it, and you put your hands on your hips, trying not to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;You kinda deserved that,&rdquo; Nat admitted. </p><p>&ldquo;That was uncalled for,&rdquo; Peter grunted while you jumped off the mat, going to your water. &ldquo;I still won!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not if you cheated!&rdquo; you spat back, resisting the urge to give him a middle finger while he muttered something under his breath, following you to grab a towel and wipe his face. He got a cheeky grin back on and threw the now sweaty towel at you, making you squeal and throw it on the ground. </p><p>&ldquo;Gross, what is wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be an Avenger, and you&rsquo;re scared of a towel?&rdquo; He sneered a little, while you glared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you two play nice?&rdquo; Nat sighed, coming up behind you both, &ldquo;How are you supposed to have each other&rsquo;s backs out there if you act like this in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just let him get-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t finish that sentence,&rdquo; Natasha interrupted, giving you a stern look. &ldquo;You know you wouldn&rsquo;t actually, and you wouldn&rsquo;t either, Peter, so don&rsquo;t speak up. Training can be done now, but we&rsquo;re going again tomorrow and if you use your strength again Peter, we&rsquo;re gonna have some problems.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i> I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>Nat just raised an eyebrow and Peter gave up, grabbing his things with a huff. You started unwrapping your hands, ignoring the angry feeling in your chest as Peter shot you a last dirty look and left the training room.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you two,&rdquo; she said once he was gone, giving you a look, &ldquo;You guys would be even better partners if you would just get along.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s annoying,&rdquo; you frowned, tossing the empty water bottle in the trash. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s like that with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know, boys are mean to girls they like,&rdquo; she smirked a little and you made a face.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t kindergarten, Nat,&rdquo; you muttered, &ldquo;You sound like Sam.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sam might be on to something,&rdquo; she teased a little, dodging the towel that you went to smack her with.</p><p>Sam (and sometimes Bucky) liked to joke that you two would be perfect together if you weren&rsquo;t bickering all the time like an old married couple, and you tried not to let it hurt when Peter made a disgusted face at those comments.</p><p>At one point you were desperate to be friends with him, maybe even more, but that time had clearly passed.</p><p>When Tony told you a new recruit was joining that was your age, you were ecstatic. Being a teenager around a bunch of adults was a bit frustrating at times - you went to school, but for training and missions and whatnot, there was no one else your age. </p><p>Peter had been nice when you first met, you remembered that. But something seemed to click after a while, and suddenly he was getting cocky during sparring and making unnecessary comments about your fighting style. You thought maybe it was jealousy but it was obvious that he was getting along well with the others and sometimes even getting more praise than you did, so you weren&rsquo;t sure what his deal was.</p><p>The thing you hated most was that Peter got along with <i>everyone</i> - even Bucky, who did his best to avoid the kid after the whole airport incident a few years back. Tony obviously had a favorite (you didn&rsquo;t really mind it that much, you&rsquo;d never been close to Tony), Steve and him joked about Queens and Brooklyn, Scott and Clint had pranks with him whenever they came by. You got along with them too, but not like Peter did - he was clearly the preferred trainee around the compound, and you wished it didn&rsquo;t hurt to realize that.</p><p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s never gonna happen,&rdquo; you said flatly, grabbing your gym bag and swinging it over your shoulder as you walked out. Nat was just a step behind you.</p><p>&ldquo;You almost sound upset about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Please</i>, stop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you get distracted on your mission tonight-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might get distracted when I go after <i>you</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay,&rdquo; she held her hands up, trying not to smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re briefing at six, leaving at seven, make sure you and Peter are ready.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, we will be,&rdquo; you frowned as she walked away, pointing a finger at you while you made a face.</p><p>A few hours later and you were in the briefing room with Sam, Bucky, Natasha, and Peter. Everyone was in their suits, Peter&rsquo;s bright red and blue attire standing out against everyone else&rsquo;s, but he was yet to get a stealth suit made, so it had to do. </p><p>Natasha had a map projected on the table and was pointing out areas for each of you to go, and you weren&rsquo;t surprised to have her pair you and Peter up, despite the amount of times you both protested. There wasn&rsquo;t much of a point of arguing against it now - he was going to go where you went, and vice versa. </p><p>&ldquo;Barnes, Wilson, you two take the second floor, east side. Take the agents out, try and cause a big enough distraction for one of them to call a distress and get the rest of the base to go there. I&rsquo;ll get the intel on the west side, Y/N and Peter go to the third floor and get into the main office. Both of you keep with your pairs and watch each other&rsquo;s backs. Sound good?&rdquo; Natasha looked up at all of you, seeing Bucky and Sam exchange a look.</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, pairing up the love birds,&rdquo; Sam joked, making you twitch a little. </p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize you guys were together,&rdquo; Peter gestured at him and Bucky, making them both stop laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you two!&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle at that, missing how Peter grinned and looked a little pleased at the fact that he made you laugh. Natasha just shook her head while Sam and Bucky started bickering.</p><p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve retired,&rdquo; she muttered before smacking her hand on the table, getting everyone to shut up. &ldquo;I said, does the plan sound good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; you and Peter responded at the same time, making Bucky snicker. </p><p>&ldquo;Great, let&rsquo;s go before you all kill each other.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>&ldquo;Why do I feel like we&rsquo;re in a horror movie and we&rsquo;re about to get killed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why</i> would you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s just the energy of this place,&rdquo; Peter muttered, and you gave him a look that basically told him to shut up. </p><p>You were both crouched on an outside platform, waiting for an all clear on when you could enter. Peter had swung you both up to the third floor where no guards were waiting outside, figuring it was the best place to break in and enter when the time called for it. And you usually didn&rsquo;t like to agree with him, but he was right this time. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the second floor,&rdquo; Bucky alerted through comms, his voice quiet, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll signal when it&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Copy that,&rdquo; Nat replied. </p><p>You sighed and shifted a little, the position uncomfortable, especially with Peter so close to you. His suit at least looked comfortable, and he was probably a lot warmer than you - yours was tight and the belt was clunky and you certainly didn&rsquo;t have a heater, and it was freezing in the cold.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop shivering,&rdquo; Peter whispered, and you went to smack his arm but he dodged it easily.</p><p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Sam said in a rush and you heard yelling and gunshots through the comms. </p><p>Peter swung up to the window and kicked through it with his foot, not even needing to try hard for it to break. He offered you a hand and pulled you up, swiping some broken glass out of the way. You crawled in first, nearly falling forward but he managed to wrap an arm around your waist and catch you.</p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; you muttered, both of you looking down and seeing how far the ground was. </p><p>&ldquo;Careful next time,&rdquo; he muttered, startling you by sticking your waist with a web and pushing you down. You held the web tight and managed not to scream as he grabbed the end of it before you hit the floor, cackling above you.</p><p>&ldquo;Uncalled for,&rdquo; you muttered, hoping he couldn&rsquo;t hear how loud your heart was beating. &ldquo;You nearly gave me a heart attack!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was fun,&rdquo; he dropped down next to you, his masked eye winking while you tried to resist the urge to attack him. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever, don&rsquo;t do that again.&rdquo;</p><p>You both fell into a silence as you turned on a flashlight, not entirely sure why the lights were off, but not having enough time to question it. The comms were like background noise in your ears and you could hear Sam and Bucky causing a ruckus on the floor below, hopefully creating enough of a distraction for no one to come find you both.</p><p>&ldquo;Seems like we have the whole base in here,&rdquo; Bucky said through the comms, &ldquo;You guys should be clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone here,&rdquo; Natasha replied, &ldquo;Y/N, Peter, you guys have been silent for a while, all good?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably making out in a closet,&rdquo; Sam chuckled amongst the fighting, and you quickly rolled your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Funny how the kids are acting more mature than the adults,&rdquo; you snapped over the comms, missing how Peter cracked a smile - not that you would see it through the mask anyway. &ldquo;Are you even doing your job?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, she&rsquo;s getting attitude,&rdquo; Bucky whistled, &ldquo;Better watch out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; Natasha said sternly, making you relax a bit, &ldquo;We can make jokes later, we need to focus on getting the intel. Go off comms unless we have a problem, Sam let us know when you two are done with the agents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes ma'am,&rdquo; Sam responded, but you could still hear the smirk in his voice, &ldquo;Peter, keep your hands to yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>You heard the comms click off and you muttered under your breath, while Peter was glad he was wearing the mask so you couldn&rsquo;t see how red the comments were making him. Finally you both came across the door, Peter putting an arm out to keep you from moving.</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on,&rdquo; he put a hand to his mask, probably using some fancy update Stark had given him to look through and make sure no one was there. &ldquo;Alright, all clear.&rdquo;</p><p>You jiggled the handle, frowning as you dropped your hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p><p>His mask shifted into what you assumed was a smirk, and he simply grabbed the handle and snapped it off, pushing the door open. He bowed and held his arm out to let you walk first, making you frown in annoyance.</p><p>&ldquo;Show off,&rdquo; you muttered, fumbling to grab the flash drive from your pocket as you hurried to the computer. Peter just snorted and shut the door behind you, putting a chair up to block it.</p><p>You typed quickly on the computer while Peter stood next to you, his fingers twitching with impatience. There were several passwords that might have worked, and it was starting to annoy the both of you when it kept blocking you out.</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go faster?&rdquo; He muttered, and you shot him a look. </p><p>&ldquo;Do <i>you</i> want to do it?&rdquo;</p><p>He just huffed and crossed his arms, looking around the room. It was mostly empty aside from some filing cabinets and chairs, but it was pretty large for just an office. You bit your lip as you finally managed to log in and start downloading the files. </p><p>&ldquo;This place is creepy,&rdquo; Peter said quietly, bouncing on his feet a little. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re distracting me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just trying to make conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s distracting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine, whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>You just rolled your eyes as you finished the code, ignoring how he kept fidgeting around. </p><p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; you pulled the drive out, sticking it in your belt and you began wiping the computer of any evidence that you both had been there.</p><p>&ldquo;About time,&rdquo; Peter muttered, and you went to snap back at him but suddenly you both heard voices from outside the room.</p><p>The door burst open despite the chair blocking it and Peter quickly yanked you down behind the desk. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t my senses go off?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re too busy annoying me and it&rsquo;s distracting you,&rdquo; you whispered back, ignoring his masked eyes squinting at you in what you assumed was a dirty look.</p><p>You could both hear multiple people come in, and you looked at Peter while he listened. His enhanced hearing often helped him figure out how many people were in the room or even where they were. He held up seven fingers, making you frown a little. Someone was definitely tipped off. With a deep breath, you adjusted your suit and nodded to him. </p><p>Despite how often you both argued, you and Peter were good partners. You could fight together without really needing to verbally communicate, and you could almost always predict each other&rsquo;s moves. Missions with him got easier over time, even when the bickering was more frequent. </p><p>He jumped up first while you snuck to the side, waiting for him to cause a big enough distraction before you came in. You watched him web two guys and bring their heads together, wincing as they both crumpled to the floor. </p><p>Once the focus was on him, you came up behind the nearest guy and placed your hands on his shoulders, kicking the backs on his knees in and forcing him to kneel and fall forward. A gun shot rang out and you almost lost focus from the guy you were fighting by looking up in a panic, only to see Peter pulling the gun from one of the men&rsquo;s hands and webbing it to the ceiling where no one could reach. You relaxed a little knowing he wasn&rsquo;t shot.</p><p>You quickly grabbed the gun from the guy you were trying to force to the ground, hitting his head with the butt of it and knocking him out. The gun was quickly knocked out of your hands by another guy and you struggled against him, trying not to get distracted watching Peter at the same time.</p><p>He was handling two guys at once, which you thought was a little unfair, even with his super strength. You twisted yourself around and managed to get your guy around the neck, but he was smart and fell back, crushing you under him. With a wince, you managed to push him off of you and roll up, glaring as he stood up again.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to start fighting you again, clearly having the upper hand. You hated on missions, how easy it was for Peter to just take down several guys with no issue, while you had to struggle so hard not to get beat in - having super powers must&rsquo;ve been nice. You took a hit to the stomach and fell to your knees, rolling out of the way as he aimed a kick for you, not sure how much more you could take. This guy was bigger than anyone you&rsquo;d fought before. </p><p>You groaned as he pulled his arm back to hit you again, but a web stuck to it and yanked him back, his face going right into Peter&rsquo;s fist. His nose crunched and the sound of it breaking made you cringe as he crumpled to the ground, knocked out. It almost shocked you - Peter usually held back on hurting people that bad. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; he muttered as he came over to you, holding his hand out for you to take. He was surprised when you took it, letting him help you up while you tried to ignore the pain from that guy gut punching you.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; you tried not to sound too bitter, snatching your hand back from him when you realized he was still holding it. &ldquo;That it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Think so,&rdquo; Peter moved around to make sure they were all out while you stared down at the guy, trying not to feel annoyed at how Peter could take him out with one punch, while you struggled with him for several minutes.</p><p>You nudged him with your shoe, relieved to see he was knocked out even if it was Peter who did it. He put his hands on his hips as he came back toward you, stepping over a few of the knocked out men.</p><p>&ldquo;Your spidey senses working now?&rdquo; You asked sarcastically, still out of breath as you held a hand to your side, feeling the ache from the punches and kicks.</p><p>Peter started speaking harshly to you but you weren&rsquo;t listening, your eyes focusing behind him to see a man hiding behind a desk you had both missed raise his gun at Peter&rsquo;s back, right where his heart was.</p><p>Your eyes widened and without thinking you yanked him around, letting the bullet catch you in the back of your shoulder. The pain made you collapse against Peter as you cried out, barely hearing his panicked voice asking what happened.</p><p>Peter finally caught sight of the guy angrily smacking his gun, clearly having some sort of issue with it, and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to shoot a web at him, using the taser webs that Karen always suggested but he usually tried to avoid. The guy dropped the gun and fell to the floor, the electricity knocking him out while Peter bent down next to you.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why</i> did you do that?&rdquo; He asked in a panicked tone, kneeling down as he ripped his mask off. His face was blurry in your vision, even when he put his hands on your face and tried to make you look at him. &ldquo;Y/N, stay with me, come on-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; you hissed out, gripping his wrist probably too tight, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, sweetheart, I know, it&rsquo;ll be okay they&rsquo;re on their way,&rdquo; he put a hand up to his ear, tapping his comms while the other one still held your face. &ldquo;Natasha, you need to get here <i>now</i>. She&rsquo;s-she&rsquo;s been shot, someone, please-&rdquo;</p><p>You were definitely out of it if you were hallucinating Peter being this soft with you, right? Nat&rsquo;s voice was in your comms but you couldn&rsquo;t hear her, the only thing you could feel was your shoulder wound and Peter holding you, trying to keep you awake, but your eyes were starting to roll back.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey come on, I got you,&rdquo; Peter lifted you up carefully, avoiding your wound, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t pass out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; you breathed out, not able to help it as your vision went dark, Peter&rsquo;s panicked tone trying to keep you awake fading out, and you blacked out.</p><p>-</p><p>The first thing you felt was the obvious sharp pain in your shoulder, the rest of your body having small aches and pressures. You could tell that you were in a hospital and it made you scrunch up your nose, hating the smell. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; You heard a soft voice ask, feeling fingers tuck your hair behind your ear and the quiet creak of a chair moving. &ldquo;You up?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; You barely opened your eyes, your sight a little blurry as you tried to focus on who was sitting there.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; you blinked and saw Peter next to you, a relieved smile on his face that made you confused. He never smiled genuinely at you. &ldquo;I almost thought you weren&rsquo;t gonna wake up, you-you really scared m-us! You really scared <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked exhausted, his hair all messed up and the bags under his eyes prevalent. You were confused by the pressure in your hand until you looked down, seeing how he was holding it in both of his tightly. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you holding my hand? Did you think I died or something?&rdquo; You mumbled with a little smirk, but his face turned hard, clearly not amused by your teasing as he dropped your hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Why the hell did you do that?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; You frowned, not liking the sudden hostility in his tone compared to how sweet he sounded when you woke up. Dumb of you to think <i>that</i> would last.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you realize how stupid that was? If he had shot you somewhere else you could be dead, I would&rsquo;ve been the reason you died and-&rdquo; Peter kept raising his voice, nearly yelling as he told you how idiotic you were being when <i>you</i> saved <i>his</i> life, which was starting to piss you off, considering you literally just woke up. </p><p>&ldquo;What, are you mad I stole your spotlight or something? Or are you upset that <i>I</i> saved your life? Which one is it?&rdquo; You interrupted, starting to feel the ache in your shoulder that was only making you angrier. <br /></p><p>He stared at you blankly for a minute, and you just glared back. It was obvious he had a lot more to say and you weren&rsquo;t sure you wanted to hear it. You had never seen him this upset about something before.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you seriously think that&rsquo;s what this is about?&rdquo; He asked quietly, and his tone somehow seemed angrier than when he was yelling. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m mad because I&rsquo;m jealous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why else would you be upset?&rdquo; You said, gritting your teeth a little. &ldquo;Just admit that&rsquo;s the reason.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m mad because you got <i>hurt</i>?&rdquo; He snapped, tugging a hand through his hair, &ldquo;Because I saw you get shot and you were bleeding out and I didn&rsquo;t know where you had been hit and I didn&rsquo;t know if you were going to die and it would have been my fault? Did you not think that maybe <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why I was mad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you care about me,&rdquo; you scoffed, but you remembered the moments before you passed out. You remembered his hands holding you and calling you &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo; and speaking softly to you, the panic on his face- </p><p>Whatever. It was just in the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I care about you doing reckless shit that could get you killed. You could&rsquo;ve <i>died</i>, Y/N, do you not realize that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine was just a shoulder wound, <i>you</i> would&rsquo;ve died! What was I supposed to do, just let him shoot you?&rdquo; You asked harshly, accidentally moving your shoulder too much. The sharp pain had you wince, putting a hand on your shoulder and gritting your teeth.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; He asked quickly, getting up and letting his hands hover a bit, not sure what to do. It was almost funny how quick his mood changed. &ldquo;Should I get the doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you muttered, not sure if you were enjoying how weird he was being. The back and forth between him pissing you off and suddenly being nice was giving you whiplash. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t take it you would have, and it would&rsquo;ve hit you by your chest and you would&rsquo;ve died. I can handle a shoulder wound, you can&rsquo;t handle one to the heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can heal fast,&rdquo; he said flatly, sounding annoyed again. &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve been fast enough to dodge it, anyway, it never would&rsquo;ve hit me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t even know it was coming!&rdquo; You cried out, resisting the urge to raise your arms in disbelief, &ldquo;You asked me what happened, you didn&rsquo;t even realize someone was shooting at you, Peter! You know that, why can&rsquo;t you just admit that I&rsquo;m right?&rdquo;</p><p>He opened his mouth to answer, but then your door opened, Natasha peeking her head in. &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re up. Parker, can I have a minute with her?&rdquo;</p><p>He shot you an angry look before stomping out, not saying anything to Natasha when he stormed by. She just raised her eyebrows and shut the door, giving you a quick look before taking the seat he was in.</p><p>&ldquo;He was in here the whole time,&rdquo; Nat said with a little smirk, and you felt your cheeks heat up. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t move from that chair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably only did that so he could yell at me the second I woke up,&rdquo; you muttered, carefully crossing your arms. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N, you should&rsquo;ve seen how scared he was when he brought you back,&rdquo; she ignored what you said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen him that worried. And don&rsquo;t act like I didn&rsquo;t see him holding your hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long was I out?&rdquo; You changed the subject, knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t be quiet otherwise. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a day,&rdquo; she sighed, leaning back in her chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky. I&rsquo;m glad to know that you guys have each other&rsquo;s backs, that was obviously shown but&hellip;try not to get shot again. I don&rsquo;t need that on my conscious.&rdquo; </p><p>You smiled a little, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. What about the flash drive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect work, as usual,&rdquo; she complimented, making you feel a bit better, &ldquo;We got the intel and no one else was hurt besides you. Which reminds me, you&rsquo;re on bed rest for a week minimum, and no training or anything crazy until your wound is healed, got it?&rdquo;</p><p>You wanted to argue, but even you couldn&rsquo;t be that stubborn. The bullet hole was starting to ache even more now that you had been awake for a while, and you could still feel the bruising from where you had been fighting. </p><p>&ldquo;Can I still go to my date on Friday?&rdquo; You asked, ignoring her little smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be healed up enough by then. Gotta say I&rsquo;m a little disappointed it isn&rsquo;t with Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you like this?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Just think you two would be cute, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she poked your nose, and you swatted her hand away while she laughed. &ldquo;But yes, you can go. Just be safe, and you know what to do if they start acting like an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can handle myself,&rdquo; you promised, &ldquo;Now can I please get something to eat? I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p><p>-</p><p>You were allowed out of the hospital bed that night, much to your relief. You were tired enough to go to bed, hoping to avoid Peter on your shared floor - luckily he seemed to have gone home or something, because he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p>Training for you was postponed until you got better, but you still attended sessions with Natasha and Peter so you could watch and listen to tips she gave him. </p><p>Peter didn&rsquo;t speak to you, which was unusual. He might&rsquo;ve not liked you, but he tended to go out of his way to make sure you were aware of that - snarky comments, sarcastic quips, whatever it was that made your blood boil. Now it was like radio silence.</p><p>You figured he was still mad about your argument, which still made no sense to you. It&rsquo;s not like you expected him to thank you or anything, but he was acting way too angry about it - it was you who got hurt, so you didn&rsquo;t understand why he was being this bitter and petty with the silent treatment.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t matter, though, you had better things to think about. By Friday you had healed up, no longer needing a bandage and your bruises had mostly faded (nothing a little concealer couldn&rsquo;t fix if needed). You sat in the kitchen with Natasha, Sam and Bucky, who were getting ready for a mission of their own and trying to bribe you to make them food before they went.</p><p>&ldquo;If you eat now you&rsquo;re gonna get a side ache,&rdquo; you smacked Bucky&rsquo;s hand away from your sandwich while you cleaned up. &ldquo;Are you really that desperate for PB&amp;J?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um, obviously,&rdquo; Bucky held his hands up and pouted, &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time to make you one, maybe you can bribe Nat,&rdquo; you took a bite of your sandwich, wiggling your eyebrows at him and Sam, who looked offended.</p><p>&ldquo;When are you gonna start getting ready for your date?&rdquo; Nat shot you a little wink while your face went slack.</p><p>&ldquo;Natasha!&rdquo; You said sharply, ignoring all the eyes on you. &ldquo;I said don&rsquo;t bring it up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nah, who&rsquo;s taking you out? Is it Peter?&rdquo; You choked on your food while Bucky and Sam snickered, making you want to throw something at their heads.</p><p>&ldquo;None of your business, but no, it&rsquo;s definitely not him,&rdquo; you glared at Nat as you took another bite of your sandwich. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just someone from school, and you guys aren&rsquo;t my parents, so please chill out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ooh, she&rsquo;s got an attitude today,&rdquo; Sam grinned, nudging your arm a bit. &ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>begging</i> you to shut up now.&rdquo;</p><p>Natasha cracked a smile and left to get some work done while Bucky and Sam decided to stay and keep annoying you with questions, but after a few minutes luckily (or maybe unluckily) a new voice interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;Why is everyone laughing?&rdquo; Your frown only deepened when a familiar set of curls was seen peeking over Bucky&rsquo;s shoulder, his eyes catching yours before quickly moving away. Weird.</p><p>&ldquo;Bet Spider-Kid here is gonna be jealous,&rdquo; Sam clapped Peter on the shoulders while him and Bucky laughed, Peter&rsquo;s face turning confused. &ldquo;Have fun on your date!&rdquo;</p><p>His face was blank for a minute while Sam and Bucky left chuckling, and you almost thought he looked upset - but then the corner of his mouth turned up. </p><p>&ldquo;You have a date?&rdquo; He gave you a shit-eating grin, &ldquo;Someone actually wants to date you?&rdquo;</p><p>You threw a spoon from the table at him, but he easily caught it, &ldquo;Yes, Parker, someone <i>actually</i> wants to date me. Will you just leave it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it tonight?&rdquo; He continued, ignoring your request while he tossed the spoon back. &ldquo;You should probably not wear Thor pajamas to a date, just a little advice.&rdquo;</p><p>You swatted his hand away from where he was tugging your Thor themed shorts (you weren&rsquo;t <i>that</i> embarrassed, and Thor thought they were hilarious). &ldquo;Back off, idiot, I&rsquo;m obviously not gonna wear these. And what advice would you know about dating, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p>He made a face at that, &ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve dated anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not with your rude personality, no,&rdquo; you missed the slightly hurt look on his face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go get ready now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Should you really be going out on a date when you&rsquo;re still healing?&rdquo; He blurted out, making you frown.</p><p>&ldquo;Why would that matter? I&rsquo;m not going to be doing anything that would make me move it around?&rdquo; You looked at him in confusion as his face turned a little red and you scoffed, realizing what he meant.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re disgusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about <i>that</i>-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a first date, dude, I wouldn&rsquo;t be-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;m saying is be careful-&rdquo;</p><p>You held a hand up, &ldquo;Whatever. I&rsquo;m leaving.&rdquo;</p><p>You shook your head as he left, pushing the annoyance away and trying to focus on being excited. Peter watched you leave with a frown, losing the appetite that he had before walking into this conversation.</p><p>He would never admit it to anyone, but the idea of you going on a date&hellip;<i>hurt</i>. And when you came down an hour later and he had to see you dressed up and nervous and excited to go out with someone that wasn&rsquo;t him - it just made him feel worse. He covered those feelings up quickly, giving you a once-over. </p><p>&ldquo;Wow, you can actually look nice!&rdquo; You shot him a middle finger, pretending you didn&rsquo;t notice how he had definitely just checked you out.</p><p>&ldquo;If I come back and my snacks are gone, I&rsquo;m coming for you,&rdquo; you threatened, and he put his hands up.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so scared,&rdquo; he mocked, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Can you go already? I have the floor to myself tonight and I&rsquo;d like you to not be in it, as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; you muttered, adjusting your jacket a little and hoping he couldn&rsquo;t tell how nervous you were. &ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; He mocked your voice, but you were too wound up about the date to respond with something snarky, so you chose to just slam the door behind you.</p><p>-</p><p>They had asked you to meet them at a coffee shop, which you thought was cute - you knew them from school and you hadn&rsquo;t thought about going out with them, but when they asked, you couldn&rsquo;t help but get a little excited. It had been ages since you went on a date and maybe&hellip;it could help you get over some stupid, definitely unrequited feelings you <i>might</i> have <i>possibly</i> had for a certain boy.</p><p>Not that you would ever admit that to anyone, not even yourself.</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t there when you arrived, which wasn&rsquo;t that strange - you came a little bit earlier than you had both planned. You ordered a drink and sat down, trying to relax a little. The coffee shop was cute and there weren&rsquo;t many people there considering it was later in the day, soft music was playing and workers seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>After a while of fumbling with your hands and not doing much, you checked the time and realized it was past the time they were meant to arrive. You stared at your drink, biting your lip and tapping your feet. It was only ten minutes, that wasn&rsquo;t too long. They could be stuck in traffic, or held up with something. </p><p>You typed up a text, just offering to get a drink for them if they were running late, giving them the chance to explain but also trying not to be weird and flat out ask if they were still coming. You sent it and just sat and sipped on your drink as you waited, trying to ignore the bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.</p><p>But ten minutes turned into an hour with no text back and you were getting a little concerned. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t want to be weird and stalk their social media to see if they were active, so you found yourself opening instagram and just going through the explore page. Some mutual friends of yours had stories up and you clicked on them to distract yourself, nearly dropping your phone when you realized what you were watching.</p><p>They were at a party, ones that you usually avoided, and you felt a little sick as you watched the video showing the person meant to be here with you, grinding up against other people while loud music played in the background and drunk people made a mess of themselves.</p><p>It was obvious that you were stood up.</p><p>You stared at your phone, your chest tightening at the realization that they were definitely not going to show up. That only left you with the option to go home, or wait here longer and ignore the stares of pity from the workers in hopes that maybe they&rsquo;ll still come.</p><p>But you weren&rsquo;t stupid.</p><p>With a sigh, you left a couple dollars on the table and hurried out of there, not wanting to see the looks on their faces. You typed a rather angry text before deciding it wasn&rsquo;t worth it and shoved your phone away, holding your arms around you while you started your walk home, trying not to feel pathetic.</p><p>You were obviously sad, you could feel the burning rejection in your chest and the tears forming at the edges of your eyes, but the idea of coming home early made you feel sick. It was only Peter there, and you could already imagine the look of glee on his face when he finds out you were stood up. </p><p>Hopefully he would&rsquo;ve gone to his room or would just ignore you, but you weren&rsquo;t sure it would be that easy.</p><p>It was quiet when you got back to the compound, and you tried not to make any noise as you got to your floor. You were sniffling a little as you came into the living room, hoping you could sneak past Peter, who was watching something on the tv, but you almost forgot about his spidey senses.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing back already?&rdquo; He asked when he noticed you, sounding a bit annoyed, but that tone quickly dropped when he saw your expression. He jumped up to block you from the hallway, concern taking over any annoyance he might have felt.</p><p>&ldquo;Are-are you crying?&rdquo; his voice went soft while you wiped your eyes, and looked down so he couldn&rsquo;t see your face.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; you said miserably, sniffing, &ldquo;Can you move? I want to go to my room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>All you wanted was to sob pathetically into your pillow but he was just standing there looking like he actually cared about you for once, and that made you break down more. &nbsp;</p><p>You were shocked when he pulled you to his chest, his arms snaking around your waist and hugging you, his voice attempting to calm you down. But instead of pulling away, you gripped the back of his shirt with your fingers and held him back while you cried, letting him comfort you.</p><p>You&rsquo;d never thought in a million years you&rsquo;d be hugging Peter Parker, but here you were, staining his shirt with your tears and make-up. He didn&rsquo;t seem to care, surprising you by pressing his lips to your hair and holding you tighter, murmuring sweet words under his breath.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; he said quietly once you calmed down a little, &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, I probably look like a mess,&rdquo; you mumbled, not even sure why you were apologizing to him or why he was even comforting you in the first place.</p><p>&ldquo;At least you smell good,&rdquo; he said flatly, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a laugh at that, giving him a weird look. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that smile!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so strange,&rdquo; you muttered, taking the excuse to step out of his arms, even though you didn&rsquo;t really want to. </p><p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Peter asked again, his soft tone making you relax a little. </p><p>&ldquo;They never showed up,&rdquo; you sniffed, still not able to meet his eyes. Peter was the last person you wanted to be this vulnerable in front of. &ldquo;And I saw on instagram that they&rsquo;re at some party. Maybe you&rsquo;re right, no one wants to date me-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never said that,&rdquo; he said quickly, before you even got the words out. &ldquo;Anyone would be lucky to have you, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, wondering who the hell was standing in front of you, because it sure wasn&rsquo;t Peter. Maybe Loki came back and was pretending to be him, because Peter would never be this kind to you, even if your heart just got stomped on.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you being so nice to me?&rdquo; You asked, not caring if it was blunt. &ldquo;Did you do something bad and now you feel guilty? I swear if you ate my snacks-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he chuckled a little, &ldquo;I just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like seeing you like this. Makes me want to go punch that idiot that stood you up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, so you&rsquo;re the only one allowed to be rude to me?&rdquo; You scoffed, though the words he said made you feel a little warm inside, even if you hated to admit it. </p><p>Peter stared at the ground for a minute before biting his lip, &ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him blankly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really in the mood to argue with you when I just got stood up, can we do this another time-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to argue,&rdquo; he promised, his tone sincere, &ldquo;I just&hellip;I want to explain why I&rsquo;ve been a dick. And I want to apologize.&rdquo;</p><p>Your mouth almost dropped in surprise. &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, gesturing to the couch. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo;</p><p>You gave him a look, but decided it might as well happen. With a small sigh you wiped your eyes of any last tears or smeared make up and went to plop down on the couch, pulling your legs up while Peter sat across from you. He stared at the ground for a minute, seeming to collect his thoughts while you waited patiently.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you,&rdquo; he finally said, making you raise an eyebrow. &ldquo;I never have. I was just jealous because when I first got here, you already had everything under control. You were my age but it still felt like you were my superior, and you knew what to do in any situation. I felt stupid, so I acted out in ways that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have. </p><p>\"You don&rsquo;t even need powers to kick my ass,&rdquo; he continued with a light chuckle, focusing on picking at his fingernails rather than meeting your eyes. &ldquo;It bothered me that even with my powers you were still seen as the better fighter. And&hellip;I only had my aunt and you had this family with the Avengers that I haven&rsquo;t really had and&hellip;and I guess I was jealous for a few reasons. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They think of you as family, you know,&rdquo; you pretended not to see the blush rising on his cheeks, &ldquo;Tony likes you more than me, you at least have to know that - he&rsquo;s obvious at playing favorites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but you&rsquo;re Nat&rsquo;s favorite,&rdquo; he shot back, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but agree a little with that. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe, but she still likes you. They all do. Maybe I was here first, but they see us both as family, and equal members of the Avengers.&rdquo;</p><p>It went silent for a minute, and you realized that it was probably your turn to explain some things. Peter hadn&rsquo;t really started the hostility between you two, and you didn&rsquo;t necessarily either, but it wasn&rsquo;t one sided by any means.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a hard time getting along with people, but I also always want people to like me,&rdquo; you admitted, trying to ignore the intensity of his gaze, &ldquo;It took me a while to get close with this team since I&rsquo;m younger than them. But when you came along it was like they all immediately loved you, you barely had to try - it took me ages for that. I guess I was insecure about it and especially when you didn&rsquo;t get along with me, I just-I <i>hate</i> when people don&rsquo;t like me. Guess that&rsquo;s why tonight was an especially hard blow.&rdquo;</p><p>You let out a harsh laugh, shaking your head while Peter stared at you for a minute. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry they did that, you seemed really excited,&rdquo; he finally said quietly, &ldquo;You deserve better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Peter, but&hellip;I don&rsquo;t really mind, I wasn&rsquo;t that interested in them anyway,&rdquo; you scoffed, &ldquo;I think I just&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t been on a date in a while? And all the ones I&rsquo;ve been on have been shitty, and I just - I really want to go on a nice date, you know, with someone who actually <i>wants</i> to be with me, who treats me how I deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s someone out there who&rsquo;s gonna treat you right,&rdquo; he promised, suddenly very focused on his lap, not really making eye contact. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re closer than you think.&rdquo;</p><p>You stared at him for a moment, not missing the light blush dusting his cheeks and the way he was sort of avoiding meeting your gaze. His nervous tell was how he tapped his fingers on his knees, biting his lip.</p><p>You were making him nervous.</p><p>&ldquo;How close, do you think?&rdquo; You asked quietly, shifting a little bit so you sat closer to him, but not making it too obvious. His eyes finally met yours and he saw your expression, but he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to answer. Instead, he carefully slid his hand into yours, maybe a little afraid that you would pull away and hate him again. But instead you let him, even giving his hand a little squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember the last time you held my hand?&rdquo; You said jokingly to ease the tension, and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me, that was the worst day I&rsquo;ve had since officially becoming an Avenger,&rdquo; he shook his head, making you raise an eyebrow.</p><p>&ldquo;Worse day <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> had? I was the one that was shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I thought I was gonna lose you,&rdquo; he responded without thinking, &ldquo;I was so mad because&hellip;because I was scared you were going to be gone and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do if anything like that happened to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you cared about me like that,&rdquo; you said, trying to ignore the butterflies in your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;I care about you a lot,&rdquo; he admitted, his eyes searching over your face. &ldquo;I guess I just have a funny way of showing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter watched you as he moved his free hand to you, scooting a little closer when you didn&rsquo;t make any objection. He let his finger trail along your arm, raising goosebumps while he bit his lip, and you knew he was dragging it out on purpose, allowing for you to pull away if you wanted to. His eyes were on your lips, a smirk raising on his own as he leaned closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Your heart is beating really fast,&rdquo; he said, and you tried not to roll your eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;You can hear my heart beating?&rdquo; You asked while he brought his hand up from your arm to cup your face, and you were sure it started beating louder by the way his grin widened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very fair, it gives away how I feel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, m'sure mine&rsquo;s beating just as much,&rdquo; he murmured, and he didn&rsquo;t wait for you to answer before pulling your face to his and kissing you.</p><p>You weren&rsquo;t exactly shocked, he had definitely been making it obvious that he was about to lay one on you, but you couldn&rsquo;t help the noise of surprise you made when he pressed his lips against yours. But still, you didn&rsquo;t hesitate to kiss him back, your lips moving against his and your mind wondering why you spent all that time bickering with him when you could&rsquo;ve been doing <i>this</i>.</p><p>His nose rubbed yours as he moved closer, and you could feel him smiling a little, just making the moment sweeter even if it made the kiss messier. He hand cupping your cheek moved to the back of your neck while the one holding your hand was moved to your waist. </p><p>He pulled away only to press you back against the couch, the look in his eyes soft before he closed them, connecting your lips again as he leaned over you. You snaked an arm around his neck and let your hand find its way into his curls, your other one resting on the back of his neck while he laid himself against you, resting between your legs.</p><p>You tried not to smile against his mouth, not really sure you believed this was even happening. Were you actually locking lips with the boy you were sure hated your guts? Those thoughts were interrupted when he was quick to slip his tongue into your mouth, surprising you again, but you tilted your head and deepened the kiss, your fingers tugging his hair a little.</p><p>He hummed into your mouth as his hand brushed against your stomach when he went to hold your waist again, and you tried not to wince when he accidentally moved over one of the bruises that still remained from the mission. With some hesitation you made yourself pull back, almost laughing when he followed your lips, pouting a little when you put a hand on his chest to stop him.</p><p>&ldquo;We should slow down a little,&rdquo; you breathed out, trying to ignore the sharp pain in your shoulder and waist that was more evident now that you weren&rsquo;t distracted by his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t want to make out until Sam and Bucky walk in and prove them right?&rdquo; He smirked a little while you smacked him on the chest, laughing.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to move around too much, remember?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Oh, shit,&rdquo; he scrambled off of you, &ldquo;I forgot, are-are you okay, I&rsquo;m so sorry-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you chuckled, holding his arms so he didn&rsquo;t go too far. One of your hands moved to cup his cheek and he shut his eyes, smiling a little as you traced his jawline, brushing your thumb against his lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute when you worry, though.&rdquo;</p><p>He just grinned and leaned down, giving you a soft kiss while this time avoiding touching you in any way that might hurt you. His curls tickled your face as he moved his lips down your jaw, and you laughed a little as he pressed kisses against your neck, propping an arm up so he didn&rsquo;t squish you.</p><p>&ldquo;As much as I&rsquo;m loving this,&rdquo; you chuckled, and you could feel him smirking against your throat, &ldquo;I really think Sam and Bucky walking in on us is a big possibility that I&rsquo;d rather not face the consequences of right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where does this leave us?&rdquo; He pulled up, still leaning over you, his eyes bright and usually thin lips swollen from all the kissing were pulled into a lazy smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you want it to leave us?&rdquo; You countered, letting your fingers trail up his arm while you didn&rsquo;t quite meet his gaze, choosing instead to focus on his crazy eyebrow or slightly crooked nose or freckles dotting his pink cheeks.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t think you could handle it if he didn&rsquo;t want to be with you after <i>that</i>. He didn&rsquo;t explicitly say he had feelings for you, what if this was just in the moment? Or he wanted some friends with benefits thing? You couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of him suggesting anything like that.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but the sound of the door slamming open interrupted him.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; Bucky&rsquo;s voice made you both jump apart, you frantically trying to fix your shirt while Peter smoothed down his hair, as if that would really work. &ldquo;Hey, thought you were on a date?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cancelled it,&rdquo; you said quickly, hoping your mascara wasn&rsquo;t streaking from your crying earlier. &ldquo;I was just down here annoying Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Sam rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Sure you were. Night kids, don&rsquo;t do anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p><p>Instead of leaving with Sam, Bucky threw himself on the couch in between you both, changing the television channel with the remote. &ldquo;Sorry to interrupt your little date, but I didn&rsquo;t get to watch the game earlier, so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; you scoffed, pushing his face as you got up, making him laugh. You exchanged a glance with Peter, not sure what to do. You almost wanted him to follow you so that you could both talk, but at the same time neither of you wanted to tip Bucky off. The teasing was not worth it. &ldquo;Um, night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Night,&rdquo; they both replied, Peter shooting you an apologetic look when Bucky wasn&rsquo;t looking, but you just gave him a smile and mouthed &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t really fine, especially when you went to bed and hoped that maybe he would come knocking on your door, but never did. You didn&rsquo;t fall asleep for a while, thinking that you were looking into it too much and then wondering if it even happened and if he would just ignore you for the rest of your life (maybe a little dramatic, but you&rsquo;d had an eventful evening).</p><p>But you did manage to fall asleep, and there was someone knocking on your door in the morning.</p><p>You opened your door to see Peter standing there with a bouquet of flowers and a bright, nervous smile on his face, and you felt stupid for staying up all night thinking he would just ignore you forever.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d take you out on a date,&rdquo; his face turned a little red, making your lips lift up in a small smile. &ldquo;We could go get breakfast and talk and you know, I can show you how you deserve to be treated? If-If you want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that,&rdquo; you said softly, taking the flowers from him and grinning. &ldquo;I should probably change out of these Thor pajamas though, right dating expert?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You could keep them on if you want,&rdquo; he laughed, wrapping an arm around your waist and pulling you against him, being careful of your shoulder. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure you do.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter pressed a kiss to your lips, and you used your free hand to hold his face so he wouldn&rsquo;t pull away so quick. He chuckled against your mouth, definitely realizing what you were doing, but not finding that he cared as he just kissed you back, his arm holding you closer.</p><p>&ldquo;Um.&rdquo;</p><p>You both broke apart to see Bucky standing there with a cup of coffee, a surprised look on his face before he grinned and went back down the hallway. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; you mumbled, pushing your face into Peter&rsquo;s chest while he laughed, his face bright red. He put his other arm around you while you also starting laughing, hugging you to his chest while you heard Bucky screaming in the kitchen.</p><p>&ldquo;You owe me fifty bucks Sam!&rdquo;</p>",

He smirked down at you while you leaned up on your elbows, glaring at him and trying to catch your breath.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nice try,&rdquo; he snickered and offered you a hand but you huffed and swatted it away, getting up on your own. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a sore loser, Y/N.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Parker,&rdquo; you muttered, brushing off your pants, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an even match when you pull shit like that, I don&rsquo;t have super powers!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said cheekily, making you roll your eyes. </p>\n<p>Natasha pursed her lips and joined you both on the mat, crossing her arms while watching you glare at him. &ldquo;Kid, we said it would be without the super strength.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was without the strength,&rdquo; Peter stared at her wide-eyed, his innocent expression making you grit your teeth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault Y/N can&rsquo;t take me down normally-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You swiped your leg under his and knocked him down, not even caring if it was immature to do so.

This takes place after Endgame so there is a major spoiler. I was kinda nervous because this is the first thing I\u2019ve written after a while but I hope you guys like it! I personally really like how it came out and that\u2019s about all I have to say for now so yeah! </b></p><p><b>Summary: After her dad Tony Stark died saving the whole universe Reader can do nothing but mourn. Peter Parker comes around to visit after a while and tries to help the reader get through this depressing time of her life. (Peter Parker x Reader)</b></p><p><b>Word Count: 1,948</b></p><p><b>Warning: Angst, Reader dealing with the death of her father</b></p><p>You were a mess. It had been two weeks since your dad sacrificed himself to save the whole universe. But right now you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care about the universe. You just wanted your dad back. It hurt like hell not having him here. You missed him so much, his hugs, his smile, his snarky remarks- everything. You hadn\u2019t talked to anyone but your mother and sister since it happened. You couldn\u2019t stand the presence of anyone else. Why did he have to sacrifice himself? Why did he have to die? You shoved your face inside your pillow as you curled into more of a ball on your bed. You were sobbing violently now, hiccoughing every now and then. You were an ugly crier. </p><p>You heard a knock on your door as you heard the small \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d of your baby sister. You sat up wiping at your face with the long sleeves of your sweater as you walked to the door to open it. \u201cYes Morgan?\u201d You said in a small voice but put on a fake smile for her. \u201cDo you want to watch a movie with me?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be downstairs in a minute.\u201d You said maintaining the false nothing is wrong voice. You loved Morgan with everything you had and even though it was stupid you didn\u2019t want her to think anything was troubling you. She was too smart for that of course. She moved forward and hugged you; you instinctively crouched down and returned the hug. </p><p>This was why he sacrificed himself, you reminded yourself. So your sister and your family and people you love could be there for you. So you could be alive. He was a hero; he saved everyone. He gave everyone their home back, he gave everyone a life. He died so others could live. It had cost you one of the most important people in your life and you had to pay that price for the rest of your life. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but sob a little as you caressed Morgan\u2019s hair, she was here because of him and you were thankful but goddamnit if you weren\u2019t mad that <i>he</i> wasn\u2019t. \u201cMom says it\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d She said breaking the hug and giving you a smile. You smiled an actual genuine smile at that; Morgan seemed to be the only thing that could make you do that these days, it seemed. </p><p>\u201cSee you downstairs in a bit.\u201d She said as she hopped down the stairs and you stood back up. You closed the door behind you and leaned against it. Sliding down against the door you hugged your knees to your chest; you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to go to the bed as you laid down on the floor, breaking down. </p><p>You didn\u2019t go downstairs. </p><p>It had been two months and you were getting better at pretending you were fine. You still hadn\u2019t talked to any of your friends but you had opened up to your mother. You couldn\u2019t remember the number of times the two of you had stayed up after Morgan would go to sleep to talk and mostly cry. You were still grieving and you didn\u2019t quite honestly know how long you would be. You thought about seeing a therapist but you felt like you needed more time. The wound still all too fresh. You hadn\u2019t opened up and talked to anyone apart from your mother about how you were feeling and you still couldn\u2019t bring yourself to pour your heart out to her knowing it would hurt her all the more. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) someone\u2019s here to see you.\u201d You heard your mother saying. She was standing by the door but it seemed you had failed to notice her arriving. You had been staring out the window completely tuned out and lost in your own head. \u201cTell them I\u2019m busy.\u201d You spoke almost absent-mindedly. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna know who it is?\u201d She asked. She had been trying to get you to talk to your friends again. You knew she thought it would be good for you and it probably would be- but.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a Peter.\u201d You replied in the same monotonous voice. You loved your mother but dear god she needed to stop trying to get you talk to other people. You knew you would eventually, but right now didn\u2019t seem like the best time. </p><p>\u201cPeter parker,\u201d Your mother said and you looked at her shaking your head slightly letting her know you still didn\u2019t know who she was talking about. \u201cSpiderman?\u201d She said with that voice of hers that said she knew you knew what she was talking about. </p><p>You did remember a Spider-man. The last time you\u2019d met him was when you were ten maybe twelve; you didn\u2019t even had a proper conversation with him but you do remember your dad telling you about him. He cared for Peter a great deal and you even found a picture of him with your dad in the kitchen. When you were a kid you were a big fan of Spiderman. You thought it was the coolest thing- a teenage superhero. </p><p>Now that you were a teenager yourself and around the same age as what he had been when he stopped the guy with the wings- you didn\u2019t think it was cool. You thought it was sad that the world was so messed up that a <i>teenager</i> felt responsible to fix it. </p><p>\u201cYou can tell Peter Parker, I\u2019m busy.\u201d You said giving your mother a cheeky Cheshire-cat smile. </p><p>\u201cJust talk to him. Please?\u201d Your mother said and you almost whined. \u201cFor me?\u201d she continued and you clenched your teeth. </p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine! Send him upstairs.\u201d You said finally giving in just wanting to make your mother happy. She gave you big bright smile, \u201cI love you.\u201d She said as she left. </p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d You mumbled out of habit. </p><p>Peter Parker was knocking at your door not too long after. It was wide open as your mother had left it and you told him to come in, not bothering to get up from the window couch- if that\u2019s what those things were called. </p><p>He came up and sat next to you; not wanting to come across as rude you turned to him and gave him a forced smile in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m (Y/N) Stark; we met a couple of years ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI remember, but of course for me it was more like a year.\u201d He replied with a smile; the same small one you give someone in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>You just nodded not knowing what to say. You wanted to ask him why he was here but that seemed a bit hostile. You also wanted to tell him to go away because you didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone that wasn\u2019t your mom, Morgan, Happy or Rhodey but you figured that too would come across as hostile. </p><p>\u201cYou were so little when I last saw you.\u201d He said maybe looking to start a conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were about as big as you are now.\u201d You replied with a smile.</p><p>The room was silent for a couple of seconds before Peter Parker spoke up again, \u201cI knew your dad. I was with him when he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You said not letting him finish. You didn\u2019t want to sound bitter but it was like you couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI know. I know you were there and so was mom and Steve Rogers and Bruce and everyone; everyone but me. Because even though dad made me a suit too- I was too little to go.\u201d You could feel the feeling of something pushing up your throat and you fought hard not to let any tears slip. You thought you were over that by now- not being able to be with your dad when he died. Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened.\u201d He said and you nodded at him running your sleeve clad palm around the edge of your eye, wiping your tears away. \u201cI miss him too, a lot. Probably not as much as you do though-\u201d He said before hesitantly placing a hand on your shoulder. \u201cbut I understand what you must feel like.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him and he seemed to be on the verge of tears himself. You still didn\u2019t know what to say. You didn\u2019t know Peter Parker and even though he may have had a strong bond with your dad- you still didn\u2019t know him. You didn\u2019t want to talk about your father to a stranger. </p><p>You gave him a genuine smile even if it was a sympathetic and sad one. \u201cWhy are you here Peter Parker?\u201d You asked and the question didn\u2019t come out hostile. It came out exhausted and tired and sad.</p><p>Peter Parker then told you about his dad and his uncle Ben. He told you about how he\u2019d lost both of them and how he truly did understand what you were going through. He talked about how over time he found some closure and how there will come a time for you when thinking about your dad won\u2019t be as painful as it was now. He also told you he still missed both his dad and uncle and how he would still sometimes cry but he also told you about how things will change and that you will be happy again- even if it didn\u2019t seem that way right now. </p><p>Then he talked about Tony. Nothing much- but he told you that he missed him and that he\u2019s sorry. You could tell he didn\u2019t want to talk about your dad as much because he understood that you wouldn\u2019t want to talk about that with a stranger. But you surprised both him and yourself- you talked about your dad. You talked about Tony and how much missed him.

Peter Parker comes around to visit after a while and tries to help the reader get through this depressing time of her life. (Peter Parker x Reader)</b></p><p><b>Word Count: 1,948</b></p><p><b>Warning: Angst, Reader dealing with the death of her father</b></p><p>You were a mess. It had been two weeks since your dad sacrificed himself to save the whole universe. But right now you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care about the universe. You just wanted your dad back. It hurt like hell not having him here. You missed him so much, his hugs, his smile, his snarky remarks- everything. You hadn\u2019t talked to anyone but your mother and sister since it happened. You couldn\u2019t stand the presence of anyone else. Why did he have to sacrifice himself? Why did he have to die? You shoved your face inside your pillow as you curled into more of a ball on your bed. You were sobbing violently now, hiccoughing every now and then. You were an ugly crier. </p><p>You heard a knock on your door as you heard the small \u201c(Y/N)?\u201d of your baby sister. You sat up wiping at your face with the long sleeves of your sweater as you walked to the door to open it. \u201cYes Morgan?\u201d You said in a small voice but put on a fake smile for her. \u201cDo you want to watch a movie with me?\u201d She asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be downstairs in a minute.\u201d You said maintaining the false nothing is wrong voice. You loved Morgan with everything you had and even though it was stupid you didn\u2019t want her to think anything was troubling you. She was too smart for that of course. She moved forward and hugged you; you instinctively crouched down and returned the hug. </p><p>This was why he sacrificed himself, you reminded yourself. So your sister and your family and people you love could be there for you. So you could be alive. He was a hero; he saved everyone. He gave everyone their home back, he gave everyone a life. He died so others could live. It had cost you one of the most important people in your life and you had to pay that price for the rest of your life. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t help but sob a little as you caressed Morgan\u2019s hair, she was here because of him and you were thankful but goddamnit if you weren\u2019t mad that <i>he</i> wasn\u2019t. \u201cMom says it\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d She said breaking the hug and giving you a smile. You smiled an actual genuine smile at that; Morgan seemed to be the only thing that could make you do that these days, it seemed. </p><p>\u201cSee you downstairs in a bit.\u201d She said as she hopped down the stairs and you stood back up. You closed the door behind you and leaned against it. Sliding down against the door you hugged your knees to your chest; you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to go to the bed as you laid down on the floor, breaking down. </p><p>You didn\u2019t go downstairs. </p><p>It had been two months and you were getting better at pretending you were fine. You still hadn\u2019t talked to any of your friends but you had opened up to your mother. You couldn\u2019t remember the number of times the two of you had stayed up after Morgan would go to sleep to talk and mostly cry. You were still grieving and you didn\u2019t quite honestly know how long you would be. You thought about seeing a therapist but you felt like you needed more time. The wound still all too fresh. You hadn\u2019t opened up and talked to anyone apart from your mother about how you were feeling and you still couldn\u2019t bring yourself to pour your heart out to her knowing it would hurt her all the more. </p><p>\u201c(Y/N) someone\u2019s here to see you.\u201d You heard your mother saying. She was standing by the door but it seemed you had failed to notice her arriving. You had been staring out the window completely tuned out and lost in your own head. \u201cTell them I\u2019m busy.\u201d You spoke almost absent-mindedly. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna know who it is?\u201d She asked. She had been trying to get you to talk to your friends again. You knew she thought it would be good for you and it probably would be- but.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a Peter.\u201d You replied in the same monotonous voice. You loved your mother but dear god she needed to stop trying to get you talk to other people. You knew you would eventually, but right now didn\u2019t seem like the best time. </p><p>\u201cPeter parker,\u201d Your mother said and you looked at her shaking your head slightly letting her know you still didn\u2019t know who she was talking about. \u201cSpiderman?\u201d She said with that voice of hers that said she knew you knew what she was talking about. </p><p>You did remember a Spider-man. The last time you\u2019d met him was when you were ten maybe twelve; you didn\u2019t even had a proper conversation with him but you do remember your dad telling you about him. He cared for Peter a great deal and you even found a picture of him with your dad in the kitchen. When you were a kid you were a big fan of Spiderman. You thought it was the coolest thing- a teenage superhero. </p><p>Now that you were a teenager yourself and around the same age as what he had been when he stopped the guy with the wings- you didn\u2019t think it was cool. You thought it was sad that the world was so messed up that a <i>teenager</i> felt responsible to fix it. </p><p>\u201cYou can tell Peter Parker, I\u2019m busy.\u201d You said giving your mother a cheeky Cheshire-cat smile. </p><p>\u201cJust talk to him. Please?\u201d Your mother said and you almost whined. \u201cFor me?\u201d she continued and you clenched your teeth. </p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201c(Y/N).\u201d </p><p>\u201cFine! Send him upstairs.\u201d You said finally giving in just wanting to make your mother happy. She gave you big bright smile, \u201cI love you.\u201d She said as she left. </p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d You mumbled out of habit. </p><p>Peter Parker was knocking at your door not too long after. It was wide open as your mother had left it and you told him to come in, not bothering to get up from the window couch- if that\u2019s what those things were called. </p><p>He came up and sat next to you; not wanting to come across as rude you turned to him and gave him a forced smile in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m (Y/N) Stark; we met a couple of years ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI remember, but of course for me it was more like a year.\u201d He replied with a smile; the same small one you give someone in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>You just nodded not knowing what to say. You wanted to ask him why he was here but that seemed a bit hostile. You also wanted to tell him to go away because you didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone that wasn\u2019t your mom, Morgan, Happy or Rhodey but you figured that too would come across as hostile. </p><p>\u201cYou were so little when I last saw you.\u201d He said maybe looking to start a conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were about as big as you are now.\u201d You replied with a smile.</p><p>The room was silent for a couple of seconds before Peter Parker spoke up again, \u201cI knew your dad. I was with him when he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You said not letting him finish. You didn\u2019t want to sound bitter but it was like you couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI know. I know you were there and so was mom and Steve Rogers and Bruce and everyone; everyone but me. Because even though dad made me a suit too- I was too little to go.\u201d You could feel the feeling of something pushing up your throat and you fought hard not to let any tears slip. You thought you were over that by now- not being able to be with your dad when he died. Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened.\u201d He said and you nodded at him running your sleeve clad palm around the edge of your eye, wiping your tears away. \u201cI miss him too, a lot. Probably not as much as you do though-\u201d He said before hesitantly placing a hand on your shoulder. \u201cbut I understand what you must feel like.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him and he seemed to be on the verge of tears himself. You still didn\u2019t know what to say. You didn\u2019t know Peter Parker and even though he may have had a strong bond with your dad- you still didn\u2019t know him. You didn\u2019t want to talk about your father to a stranger. </p><p>You gave him a genuine smile even if it was a sympathetic and sad one. \u201cWhy are you here Peter Parker?\u201d You asked and the question didn\u2019t come out hostile. It came out exhausted and tired and sad.</p><p>Peter Parker then told you about his dad and his uncle Ben. He told you about how he\u2019d lost both of them and how he truly did understand what you were going through. He talked about how over time he found some closure and how there will come a time for you when thinking about your dad won\u2019t be as painful as it was now. He also told you he still missed both his dad and uncle and how he would still sometimes cry but he also told you about how things will change and that you will be happy again- even if it didn\u2019t seem that way right now. </p><p>Then he talked about Tony. Nothing much- but he told you that he missed him and that he\u2019s sorry. You could tell he didn\u2019t want to talk about your dad as much because he understood that you wouldn\u2019t want to talk about that with a stranger. But you surprised both him and yourself- you talked about your dad. You talked about Tony and how much missed him. You told Peter Parker about the time when your dad had talked about him about how much he had missed him too. You cried a little but it didn\u2019t matter because so did Peter Parker. You listened to him talk about your dad then; he told you how safe he felt even when he was in space all because he was with Tony Stark. He told you about how he was scared when he dying because he didn\u2019t want your dad to feel like him dying was his fault. Peter Parker told you how much he loved Tony Stark. </p><p>Through all the tears somehow you and Peter Parker managed to talk about the good times you had with your dad too.

It was wide open as your mother had left it and you told him to come in, not bothering to get up from the window couch- if that\u2019s what those things were called. </p><p>He came up and sat next to you; not wanting to come across as rude you turned to him and gave him a forced smile in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m (Y/N) Stark; we met a couple of years ago.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI remember, but of course for me it was more like a year.\u201d He replied with a smile; the same small one you give someone in acknowledgment. \u201cI\u2019m Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p>You just nodded not knowing what to say. You wanted to ask him why he was here but that seemed a bit hostile. You also wanted to tell him to go away because you didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone that wasn\u2019t your mom, Morgan, Happy or Rhodey but you figured that too would come across as hostile. </p><p>\u201cYou were so little when I last saw you.\u201d He said maybe looking to start a conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were about as big as you are now.\u201d You replied with a smile.</p><p>The room was silent for a couple of seconds before Peter Parker spoke up again, \u201cI knew your dad. I was with him when he-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d You said not letting him finish. You didn\u2019t want to sound bitter but it was like you couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cI know. I know you were there and so was mom and Steve Rogers and Bruce and everyone; everyone but me. Because even though dad made me a suit too- I was too little to go.\u201d You could feel the feeling of something pushing up your throat and you fought hard not to let any tears slip. You thought you were over that by now- not being able to be with your dad when he died. Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened.\u201d He said and you nodded at him running your sleeve clad palm around the edge of your eye, wiping your tears away. \u201cI miss him too, a lot. Probably not as much as you do though-\u201d He said before hesitantly placing a hand on your shoulder. \u201cbut I understand what you must feel like.\u201d </p><p>You looked at him and he seemed to be on the verge of tears himself. You still didn\u2019t know what to say. You didn\u2019t know Peter Parker and even though he may have had a strong bond with your dad- you still didn\u2019t know him. You didn\u2019t want to talk about your father to a stranger. </p><p>You gave him a genuine smile even if it was a sympathetic and sad one. \u201cWhy are you here Peter Parker?\u201d You asked and the question didn\u2019t come out hostile. It came out exhausted and tired and sad.</p><p>Peter Parker then told you about his dad and his uncle Ben. He told you about how he\u2019d lost both of them and how he truly did understand what you were going through. He talked about how over time he found some closure and how there will come a time for you when thinking about your dad won\u2019t be as painful as it was now. He also told you he still missed both his dad and uncle and how he would still sometimes cry but he also told you about how things will change and that you will be happy again- even if it didn\u2019t seem that way right now. </p><p>Then he talked about Tony. Nothing much- but he told you that he missed him and that he\u2019s sorry. You could tell he didn\u2019t want to talk about your dad as much because he understood that you wouldn\u2019t want to talk about that with a stranger. But you surprised both him and yourself- you talked about your dad. You talked about Tony and how much missed him. You told Peter Parker about the time when your dad had talked about him about how much he had missed him too. You cried a little but it didn\u2019t matter because so did Peter Parker. You listened to him talk about your dad then; he told you how safe he felt even when he was in space all because he was with Tony Stark. He told you about how he was scared when he dying because he didn\u2019t want your dad to feel like him dying was his fault. Peter Parker told you how much he loved Tony Stark. </p><p>Through all the tears somehow you and Peter Parker managed to talk about the good times you had with your dad too. You told him about the last five years and how they were the best years of your life because you didn\u2019t have to worry about your dad dying every other month. You told him about the time when your mother was pregnant with Morgan and the time the two of you spent building the nursery. </p><p>You talked to Peter Parker about your dad for hours- the longest you\u2019ve talked to someone who wasn\u2019t your family in a month. Soon it was time for him to go home and you walked him out to the front door. \u201cIt was really nice talking to you. Thank you for coming by.\u201d You said leaning against the lawn door. </p><p>\u201cIt was nice talking to you too. Maybe you can come downstairs the next time Aunt May and I come for dinner.\u201d He said with a small laugh. </p><p>You had no idea that Peter Parker and his aunt came around for dinner, you were mostly always in your room. You still gave him a smile and a nod, \u201cI will.\u201d you said. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cGoodbye Peter Parker.\u201d </p><p><b>(A/N): How\u2019d you guys like it?

This takes place after Endgame so there is a major spoiler. I was kinda nervous because this is the first thing I&rsquo;ve written after a while but I hope you guys like it! I personally really like how it came out and that&rsquo;s about all I have to say for now so yeah! </b></p><p><b>Summary: After her dad Tony Stark died saving the whole universe Reader can do nothing but mourn. Peter Parker comes around to visit after a while and tries to help the reader get through this depressing time of her life. (Peter Parker x Reader)</b></p><p><b>Word Count: 1,948</b></p><p><b>Warning: Angst, Reader dealing with the death of her father</b></p><p>You were a mess. It had been two weeks since your dad sacrificed himself to save the whole universe. But right now you couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to care about the universe. You just wanted your dad back. It hurt like hell not having him here. You missed him so much, his hugs, his smile, his snarky remarks- everything. You hadn&rsquo;t talked to anyone but your mother and sister since it happened. You couldn&rsquo;t stand the presence of anyone else. Why did he have to sacrifice himself? Why did he have to die? You shoved your face inside your pillow as you curled into more of a ball on your bed. You were sobbing violently now, hiccoughing every now and then. You were an ugly crier. </p><p>You heard a knock on your door as you heard the small &ldquo;(Y/N)?&rdquo; of your baby sister. You sat up wiping at your face with the long sleeves of your sweater as you walked to the door to open it. &ldquo;Yes Morgan?&rdquo; You said in a small voice but put on a fake smile for her. &ldquo;Do you want to watch a movie with me?&rdquo; She asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll be downstairs in a minute.&rdquo; You said maintaining the false nothing is wrong voice. You loved Morgan with everything you had and even though it was stupid you didn&rsquo;t want her to think anything was troubling you. She was too smart for that of course. She moved forward and hugged you; you instinctively crouched down and returned the hug. </p><p>This was why he sacrificed himself, you reminded yourself. So your sister and your family and people you love could be there for you. So you could be alive. He was a hero; he saved everyone. He gave everyone their home back, he gave everyone a life. He died so others could live. It had cost you one of the most important people in your life and you had to pay that price for the rest of your life. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t help but sob a little as you caressed Morgan&rsquo;s hair, she was here because of him and you were thankful but goddamnit if you weren&rsquo;t mad that <i>he</i> wasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Mom says it&rsquo;s going to be alright.&rdquo; She said breaking the hug and giving you a smile. You smiled an actual genuine smile at that; Morgan seemed to be the only thing that could make you do that these days, it seemed. </p><p>&ldquo;See you downstairs in a bit.&rdquo; She said as she hopped down the stairs and you stood back up. You closed the door behind you and leaned against it. Sliding down against the door you hugged your knees to your chest; you couldn&rsquo;t even bring yourself to go to the bed as you laid down on the floor, breaking down. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t go downstairs. </p><p>It had been two months and you were getting better at pretending you were fine. You still hadn&rsquo;t talked to any of your friends but you had opened up to your mother. You couldn&rsquo;t remember the number of times the two of you had stayed up after Morgan would go to sleep to talk and mostly cry. You were still grieving and you didn&rsquo;t quite honestly know how long you would be. You thought about seeing a therapist but you felt like you needed more time. The wound still all too fresh. You hadn&rsquo;t opened up and talked to anyone apart from your mother about how you were feeling and you still couldn&rsquo;t bring yourself to pour your heart out to her knowing it would hurt her all the more. </p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) someone&rsquo;s here to see you.&rdquo; You heard your mother saying. She was standing by the door but it seemed you had failed to notice her arriving. You had been staring out the window completely tuned out and lost in your own head. &ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; You spoke almost absent-mindedly. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wanna know who it is?&rdquo; She asked. She had been trying to get you to talk to your friends again. You knew she thought it would be good for you and it probably would be- but.</p><p>&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Peter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a Peter.&rdquo; You replied in the same monotonous voice. You loved your mother but dear god she needed to stop trying to get you talk to other people. You knew you would eventually, but right now didn&rsquo;t seem like the best time. </p><p>&ldquo;Peter parker,&rdquo; Your mother said and you looked at her shaking your head slightly letting her know you still didn&rsquo;t know who she was talking about. &ldquo;Spiderman?&rdquo; She said with that voice of hers that said she knew you knew what she was talking about. </p><p>You did remember a Spider-man. The last time you&rsquo;d met him was when you were ten maybe twelve; you didn&rsquo;t even had a proper conversation with him but you do remember your dad telling you about him. He cared for Peter a great deal and you even found a picture of him with your dad in the kitchen. When you were a kid you were a big fan of Spiderman. You thought it was the coolest thing- a teenage superhero. </p><p>Now that you were a teenager yourself and around the same age as what he had been when he stopped the guy with the wings- you didn&rsquo;t think it was cool. You thought it was sad that the world was so messed up that a <i>teenager</i> felt responsible to fix it. </p><p>&ldquo;You can tell Peter Parker, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; You said giving your mother a cheeky Cheshire-cat smile. </p><p>&ldquo;Just talk to him. Please?&rdquo; Your mother said and you almost whined. &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; she continued and you clenched your teeth. </p><p>&ldquo;Maybe later.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N).&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fine! Send him upstairs.&rdquo; You said finally giving in just wanting to make your mother happy. She gave you big bright smile, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; She said as she left. </p><p>&ldquo;Love you too.&rdquo; You mumbled out of habit. </p><p>Peter Parker was knocking at your door not too long after. It was wide open as your mother had left it and you told him to come in, not bothering to get up from the window couch- if that&rsquo;s what those things were called. </p><p>He came up and sat next to you; not wanting to come across as rude you turned to him and gave him a forced smile in acknowledgment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m (Y/N) Stark; we met a couple of years ago.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I remember, but of course for me it was more like a year.&rdquo; He replied with a smile; the same small one you give someone in acknowledgment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter Parker.&rdquo; </p><p>You just nodded not knowing what to say.
