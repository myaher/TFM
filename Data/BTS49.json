However, no one answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>She went upstairs while you sat on the sofa near the doorway and placed your bag on the floor. You heard her open and then close their bedroom doors. \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d you loudly asked for her to hear it upstairs.</p><p>You heard some murmuring upstairs between Seolji and his brother, Seokjin. Your heart pounded like never before in fear. It\u2019s been a while since you last saw him. You guys knew each other your whole lives but started dating when you were a freshman and he was already a senior in high school. However, no one knew. You two broke up a year later because you nearly had no time to date because of other factors. Then, it became awkward because of lack of communication. Though it\u2019s been nearly four years since you parted ways, you still can\u2019t forget him because he was your first in <i>everything</i>. Yep, he took your virginity away.</p><p>Just hearing his name makes you have goosebumps. You can still feel how his hands massaged your breasts until your nipples became lofty and hard, and how they ran through your body all the way to your pussy.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at work today?\u201d Seolji asked as she started to go downstairs with his brother.</p><p>\u201cI asked if I could work from home today and my boss said yes,\u201d Seokjin replied.</p><p>You could already see his legs as he goes down the staits and it makes your heart pound faster. In panic, you just pulled your phone from your pocket and pretended to text.</p><p>\u201cOh, look who\u2019s here,\u201d Seokjin calmly said as he looked at you with malice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a while since you guys saw each other,\u201d replied Seolji.</p><p>They walked towards the kitchen without an answer from you. You pretended to not notice them because you were <i>texting.</i></p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s been a while since she came here. What\u2019s up?\u201d You faintly heard Seokjin ask Seolji.</p><p>You stopped <i>texting </i>and started to concentrate and widen your hearing range. \u201cJust a school project,\u201d Seolji replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years since she last went here. Don\u2019t you have any other projects together? Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just weird.\u201d This bastard was a great actor. You really couldn\u2019t tell that he was acting (that he\u2019s really asking) unless you knew he was.</p><p>\u201cAs much as possible, we do them at our friends\u2019 houses or at her house. Besides, I don\u2019t want to give mom a hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>You started to <i>text</i> again when Seokjin was about to walk past you to go back to his room. The awkward electricity between the two of you is uncanny. He was followed by Seolji who stopped at the sofa where you were sitting.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said with a big pound on your heart.</p><p>When you were finally upstairs, you saw that his bedroom door is open. Seolji\u2019s and his rooms are facing each other.</p><p><i>This guy\u2019s up to something, </i>you thought to yourself, and it\u2019s making you crazy.</p><p>Seolji and you immediately went to her room. Just as she shut the door, her phone rang. You saw the name of her mom on the screen.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d she said. \u201cMom. Huh? Now? Why? Really? What if I can\u2019t? Ugh, okay. Fine.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call and looked worried. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s in Myeongdong right now and she wants me to follow her there. It\u2019s about her friend. I\u2019m just going to find out there,\u201d she replied. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll be back in an hour. And my mom\u2019s gonna get excited to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Seolji opened the door when you asked, \u201cCan I use the restroom here in your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clogged. You can use the one in my brother\u2019s room instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s that?\u201d Seokjin excitedly asked as he came out of his room.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to use your restroom. I\u2019ll take off now. Mom\u2019s waiting at Myeongdong. Bye!\u201d</p><p>Your heart was bouncing like a ball inside your chest. And those lusty thoughts and memories\u2026 they just don\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick,\u201d you said as you rushed straight to his bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou can take your time. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. You knew he was looking straight at you but you shut the door quickly.</p><p>You took your pants off to do your business but it already took a few minutes and you\u2019re still sitting there, looking at the blue wall like a fool. Sitting half-naked in this room again with wet pussy feels weird. After some time, you flushed the toilet and washed your hands. You were hoping he didn\u2019t notice how long you were inside, but that was impossible for sure.</p><p>When you opened the door, you saw him sitting in his bed\u2014where his door was the nearest. And now the door was closed, by the way. You walked briskly to avoid him but he spread out his arm to stop you.</p><p>\u201cThis door has a password,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the password,\u201d you replied.</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cThe password is incorrect.\u201d</p><p>You just stood there and looked at the floor. <i>Oh, the floor. </i>Everything in this room just reminds you of when you were still had some crazy good sex regularly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know the password?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever,\u201d you replied in a shaky voice. <i>Darn it, </i>you thought, <i>he probably knows by now!</i></p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the password. <i>I missed you.</i>\u201d</p><p>You opted to ignore it and reach for the doorknob when he held your arm and pulled you so close to him. He hugged you tight as he looked straight at your face. Unknowingly, your hands held his arms tightly as you gave back his deep gaze. You miss him too and you know that. He slowly laid down to his bed, putting you on top of him. You slipped your shoes off of your feet.</p><p>You two started to kiss gently and then Seokjin suddenly does his old habit of massaging your butt while kissing. You put his hand to the right place and then started to caress his chest in return. His tongue slowly makes its way to your mouth to fight with yours and you willingly accept the challenge. Nothing has changed; his tongue is still strong, and you still lost like the last time. You parted from the kiss to gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cHoly smokes, I missed this,\u201d Seokjin uttered as he pulled his shirt off, and so did you\u2014along with you bra. He stared at your well-developed body, especially at your breasts. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot bigger now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said as you played with it a little in front of him.</p><p>With shiny eyes and a watering mouth, he slowly massaged your breasts. You closed your eyes and lean on his headboard in pleasure. \u201cHmp,\u201d you said everytime he pushes your nipples in between his fingers. \u201cSuck them, please,\u201d you pleaded.</p><p>\u201cEverything for my queen,\u201d he said as he leaned forward and licked the top of your nipple to tease.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d you murmured.</p><p>He started to suck your left right boob gentle and then hard\u2014and repeating the same routine. You pulled off your skirt along with your underwear as he was sucking and playing with your breasts. \u201cOh, God, I can\u2019t,\u201d you started to finger yourself in front of him. You\u2019ve been keeping this in for so long and it feels so good to finally release it. He held your hand and did it for you instead. He pulled you down to lie on his bed comfortably. He removed his pants then. You missed that big thing.</p><p>He slowly touched the top of your vagina\u2014especially your clit. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d He started to move his fingers rapidly like a motorboat on top of it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d You screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou like that? Huh?\u201d He asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cPut your fingers in, please,\u201d you said as you held his arm tightly in pleasure. He suddenly put two of his fingers inside. It felt as if you were devirginized for the second time. \u201cFuck!\u201d He started to move his fingers briskly while he was massaging your clit. You were trying to compose yourself but it was so hard. It just felt so good.</p><p>You sat down in the midst of him fingering you to start massaging his dick up and down. \u201cShit,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFaster, baby.\u201d As you did your job faster, he fingered you deeper and faster which made your torso shake. Orgasm. As soon as Seokjin pulled out his fingers, you leaned in front of his dick and licked it. His legs lost their energy and he ended up sitting comfortably, looking at his dick getting sucked by his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>You licked the tip first, and then the body, and then his balls. He held your head in pleasure. You started to suck his cock, making sure that you suck more and more each time you move. You started to move faster and faster, making your saliva and his pre-cum make a river on your face and on his dick. \u201cFaster, baby. I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he said, eyes closed. Not too long after, you his cum enveloped your mouth. \u201cOh, God! Go on top of me now, baby. Please!\u201d</p><p>You rubbed your vagina wide first before going on top of him. You held the tip of his head, inserting it on your pussy. \u201cHmp,\u201d you moaned. It\u2019s been a while since someone went inside you. You let his cock slide inside your pussy deeper and deeper the more you ride him. \u201cShit,\u201d you uttered as you felt a little discomfort when everything has entered your pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go slowly,\u201d you said as you held on his knees.</p><p>He moved upwards as you went downwards to meet you in the middle. He held your waist to slower it down. You went faster ans faster when you\u2019ve produced enough wetness. His huge dick needs a ton.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d you said as you lifted your head and closed your eyes. \u201cFuck, fuck fuck!\u201d You felt his hand rub your clit as you were briskly riding him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, panting. He slowly lied you down to retain his dick inside your pussy. You put your legs on his shoulders and he started to pound you like wood. Your waist lifts itself up everytime he hits the spot. For the second time, your torso shook involuntarily. Your second orgasm. He went out and started to masturbate to reach his own orgasm. He placed the tip of his cock on your belly and in time, his cum came out on you.</p><p>Your pantings are the only sounds that can be heard in the room. The both of you smiled and kissed. He lied down beside you and said, \u201cYou can borrow my restroom anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said before wiping his cum out of your belly and standing up to get dressed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"255\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e67620abee7aa8db9ec62335bd491d54/tumblr_inline_ppg7hqO1QA1t8ixxf_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"255\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>",

You held the tip of his head, inserting it on your pussy. \u201cHmp,\u201d you moaned. It\u2019s been a while since someone went inside you. You let his cock slide inside your pussy deeper and deeper the more you ride him. \u201cShit,\u201d you uttered as you felt a little discomfort when everything has entered your pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go slowly,\u201d you said as you held on his knees.</p><p>He moved upwards as you went downwards to meet you in the middle. He held your waist to slower it down. You went faster ans faster when you\u2019ve produced enough wetness. His huge dick needs a ton.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d you said as you lifted your head and closed your eyes. \u201cFuck, fuck fuck!\u201d You felt his hand rub your clit as you were briskly riding him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, panting. He slowly lied you down to retain his dick inside your pussy. You put your legs on his shoulders and he started to pound you like wood. Your waist lifts itself up everytime he hits the spot. For the second time, your torso shook involuntarily. Your second orgasm. He went out and started to masturbate to reach his own orgasm. He placed the tip of his cock on your belly and in time, his cum came out on you.</p><p>Your pantings are the only sounds that can be heard in the room. The both of you smiled and kissed. He lied down beside you and said, \u201cYou can borrow my restroom anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said before wiping his cum out of your belly and standing up to get dressed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"255\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e67620abee7aa8db9ec62335bd491d54/tumblr_inline_ppg7hqO1QA1t8ixxf_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"255\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure></p>",

However, no one answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>She went upstairs while you sat on the sofa near the doorway and placed your bag on the floor. You heard her open and then close their bedroom doors. \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d you loudly asked for her to hear it upstairs.</p><p>You heard some murmuring upstairs between Seolji and his brother, Seokjin. Your heart pounded like never before in fear. It\u2019s been a while since you last saw him. You guys knew each other your whole lives but started dating when you were a freshman and he was already a senior in high school. However, no one knew. You two broke up a year later because you nearly had no time to date because of other factors. Then, it became awkward because of lack of communication. Though it\u2019s been nearly four years since you parted ways, you still can\u2019t forget him because he was your first in <i>everything</i>. Yep, he took your virginity away.</p><p>Just hearing his name makes you have goosebumps. You can still feel how his hands massaged your breasts until your nipples became lofty and hard, and how they ran through your body all the way to your pussy.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at work today?\u201d Seolji asked as she started to go downstairs with his brother.</p><p>\u201cI asked if I could work from home today and my boss said yes,\u201d Seokjin replied.</p><p>You could already see his legs as he goes down the staits and it makes your heart pound faster. In panic, you just pulled your phone from your pocket and pretended to text.</p><p>\u201cOh, look who\u2019s here,\u201d Seokjin calmly said as he looked at you with malice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a while since you guys saw each other,\u201d replied Seolji.</p><p>They walked towards the kitchen without an answer from you. You pretended to not notice them because you were <i>texting.</i></p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s been a while since she came here. What\u2019s up?\u201d You faintly heard Seokjin ask Seolji.</p><p>You stopped <i>texting </i>and started to concentrate and widen your hearing range. \u201cJust a school project,\u201d Seolji replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years since she last went here. Don\u2019t you have any other projects together? Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just weird.\u201d This bastard was a great actor. You really couldn\u2019t tell that he was acting (that he\u2019s really asking) unless you knew he was.</p><p>\u201cAs much as possible, we do them at our friends\u2019 houses or at her house. Besides, I don\u2019t want to give mom a hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>You started to <i>text</i> again when Seokjin was about to walk past you to go back to his room. The awkward electricity between the two of you is uncanny. He was followed by Seolji who stopped at the sofa where you were sitting.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d you said with a big pound on your heart.</p><p>When you were finally upstairs, you saw that his bedroom door is open. Seolji\u2019s and his rooms are facing each other.</p><p><i>This guy\u2019s up to something, </i>you thought to yourself, and it\u2019s making you crazy.</p><p>Seolji and you immediately went to her room. Just as she shut the door, her phone rang. You saw the name of her mom on the screen.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d she said. \u201cMom. Huh? Now? Why? Really? What if I can\u2019t? Ugh, okay. Fine.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call and looked worried. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d You asked.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s in Myeongdong right now and she wants me to follow her there. It\u2019s about her friend. I\u2019m just going to find out there,\u201d she replied. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll be back in an hour. And my mom\u2019s gonna get excited to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Seolji opened the door when you asked, \u201cCan I use the restroom here in your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clogged. You can use the one in my brother\u2019s room instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s that?\u201d Seokjin excitedly asked as he came out of his room.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to use your restroom. I\u2019ll take off now. Mom\u2019s waiting at Myeongdong. Bye!\u201d</p><p>Your heart was bouncing like a ball inside your chest. And those lusty thoughts and memories\u2026 they just don\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick,\u201d you said as you rushed straight to his bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou can take your time. I don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said. You knew he was looking straight at you but you shut the door quickly.</p><p>You took your pants off to do your business but it already took a few minutes and you\u2019re still sitting there, looking at the blue wall like a fool. Sitting half-naked in this room again with wet pussy feels weird. After some time, you flushed the toilet and washed your hands. You were hoping he didn\u2019t notice how long you were inside, but that was impossible for sure.</p><p>When you opened the door, you saw him sitting in his bed\u2014where his door was the nearest. And now the door was closed, by the way. You walked briskly to avoid him but he spread out his arm to stop you.</p><p>\u201cThis door has a password,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the password,\u201d you replied.</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cThe password is incorrect.\u201d</p><p>You just stood there and looked at the floor. <i>Oh, the floor. </i>Everything in this room just reminds you of when you were still had some crazy good sex regularly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know the password?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever,\u201d you replied in a shaky voice. <i>Darn it, </i>you thought, <i>he probably knows by now!</i></p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the password. <i>I missed you.</i>\u201d</p><p>You opted to ignore it and reach for the doorknob when he held your arm and pulled you so close to him. He hugged you tight as he looked straight at your face. Unknowingly, your hands held his arms tightly as you gave back his deep gaze. You miss him too and you know that. He slowly laid down to his bed, putting you on top of him. You slipped your shoes off of your feet.</p><p>You two started to kiss gently and then Seokjin suddenly does his old habit of massaging your butt while kissing. You put his hand to the right place and then started to caress his chest in return. His tongue slowly makes its way to your mouth to fight with yours and you willingly accept the challenge. Nothing has changed; his tongue is still strong, and you still lost like the last time. You parted from the kiss to gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cHoly smokes, I missed this,\u201d Seokjin uttered as he pulled his shirt off, and so did you\u2014along with you bra. He stared at your well-developed body, especially at your breasts. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot bigger now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you said as you played with it a little in front of him.</p><p>With shiny eyes and a watering mouth, he slowly massaged your breasts. You closed your eyes and lean on his headboard in pleasure. \u201cHmp,\u201d you said everytime he pushes your nipples in between his fingers. \u201cSuck them, please,\u201d you pleaded.</p><p>\u201cEverything for my queen,\u201d he said as he leaned forward and licked the top of your nipple to tease.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d you murmured.</p><p>He started to suck your left right boob gentle and then hard\u2014and repeating the same routine. You pulled off your skirt along with your underwear as he was sucking and playing with your breasts. \u201cOh, God, I can\u2019t,\u201d you started to finger yourself in front of him. You\u2019ve been keeping this in for so long and it feels so good to finally release it. He held your hand and did it for you instead. He pulled you down to lie on his bed comfortably. He removed his pants then. You missed that big thing.</p><p>He slowly touched the top of your vagina\u2014especially your clit. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet.\u201d He started to move his fingers rapidly like a motorboat on top of it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d You screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou like that? Huh?\u201d He asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cPut your fingers in, please,\u201d you said as you held his arm tightly in pleasure. He suddenly put two of his fingers inside. It felt as if you were devirginized for the second time. \u201cFuck!\u201d He started to move his fingers briskly while he was massaging your clit. You were trying to compose yourself but it was so hard. It just felt so good.</p><p>You sat down in the midst of him fingering you to start massaging his dick up and down. \u201cShit,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFaster, baby.\u201d As you did your job faster, he fingered you deeper and faster which made your torso shake. Orgasm. As soon as Seokjin pulled out his fingers, you leaned in front of his dick and licked it. His legs lost their energy and he ended up sitting comfortably, looking at his dick getting sucked by his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>You licked the tip first, and then the body, and then his balls. He held your head in pleasure. You started to suck his cock, making sure that you suck more and more each time you move. You started to move faster and faster, making your saliva and his pre-cum make a river on your face and on his dick. \u201cFaster, baby. I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he said, eyes closed. Not too long after, you his cum enveloped your mouth. \u201cOh, God! Go on top of me now, baby. Please!\u201d</p><p>You rubbed your vagina wide first before going on top of him.

He held your waist to slower it down. You went faster ans faster when you\u2019ve produced enough wetness. His huge dick needs a ton.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d you said as you lifted your head and closed your eyes. \u201cFuck, fuck fuck!\u201d You felt his hand rub your clit as you were briskly riding him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said, panting. He slowly lied you down to retain his dick inside your pussy. You put your legs on his shoulders and he started to pound you like wood. Your waist lifts itself up everytime he hits the spot.

It felt as if you were devirginized for the second time. &ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; He started to move his fingers briskly while he was massaging your clit. You were trying to compose yourself but it was so hard. It just felt so good.</p><p>You sat down in the midst of him fingering you to start massaging his dick up and down. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Faster, baby.&rdquo; As you did your job faster, he fingered you deeper and faster which made your torso shake. Orgasm. As soon as Seokjin pulled out his fingers, you leaned in front of his dick and licked it. His legs lost their energy and he ended up sitting comfortably, looking at his dick getting sucked by his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>You licked the tip first, and then the body, and then his balls. He held your head in pleasure. You started to suck his cock, making sure that you suck more and more each time you move. You started to move faster and faster, making your saliva and his pre-cum make a river on your face and on his dick. &ldquo;Faster, baby. I&rsquo;m coming, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he said, eyes closed. Not too long after, you his cum enveloped your mouth. &ldquo;Oh, God! Go on top of me now, baby. Please!&rdquo;</p><p>You rubbed your vagina wide first before going on top of him. You held the tip of his head, inserting it on your pussy. &ldquo;Hmp,&rdquo; you moaned. It&rsquo;s been a while since someone went inside you. You let his cock slide inside your pussy deeper and deeper the more you ride him. &ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; you uttered as you felt a little discomfort when everything has entered your pussy.</p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go slowly,&rdquo; you said as you held on his knees.</p><p>He moved upwards as you went downwards to meet you in the middle. He held your waist to slower it down. You went faster ans faster when you&rsquo;ve produced enough wetness. His huge dick needs a ton.</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, baby,&rdquo; you said as you lifted your head and closed your eyes. &ldquo;Fuck, fuck fuck!&rdquo; You felt his hand rub your clit as you were briskly riding him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, panting. He slowly lied you down to retain his dick inside your pussy. You put your legs on his shoulders and he started to pound you like wood. Your waist lifts itself up everytime he hits the spot. For the second time, your torso shook involuntarily. Your second orgasm. He went out and started to masturbate to reach his own orgasm. He placed the tip of his cock on your belly and in time, his cum came out on you.</p><p>Your pantings are the only sounds that can be heard in the room. The both of you smiled and kissed. He lied down beside you and said, &ldquo;You can borrow my restroom anytime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; you said before wiping his cum out of your belly and standing up to get dressed.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e67620abee7aa8db9ec62335bd491d54/tumblr_inline_ppg7hqO1QA1t8ixxf_500.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure></p>",
