He had diamond, I had pearl, then he had black, I had white, he had Y and I had X, you get the gist. He bought me this big poster of all the Pokemon before Sun and moon, it was great. He doesn\u2019t come around as much as he used to, but when he does, we still play.

Well, bye, Teej. Seeya tomorrow!\u201d Cyrus waved, went up to his door before it happened. Then, he looked back. Tj saw, having looked back himself, and the two smiled at eachother as Cyrus walked in and Tj walked away.</p><p>Once he got home, he yelled, \u201cAmber! It fucking happened!\u201d Luckily, his mom wasn\u2019t home. However, Reed was on the couch along with Amber talking about random stuff (tyrus). </p><p>\u201cWoah I\u2019ve never heard you swear such big words.\u201d Reed put a hand over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTj, what happened..?\u201d Amber questioned.</p><p>\u201cWe looked back at the same time!\u201d Tj sat between the two blondes.</p><p>\u201cWell, now yu know you have a chance, so, go get your man soon!\u201d Amber laughed. The three blondes talked the rest of the night, Reed having stayed over, and played SSBU.</p><p>Meanwhile, when Cyrus shut the door, he slouched down and put his hands in his head, before sighing. Buffy and Andi had came over and were waiting for him, so he\u2019d better go to the living room where the were. \u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Cy!\u201d They both said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Buffy questioned him.</p><p>\u201cAndi, you know how you told me about the look back thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kinda both did that, at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god!

Like, he doesn\u2019t actually like me and stuff. And he\u2019s already like the straightest straight he probably is even more straight a-\u201d </p><p>\u201cCyrus, I doubt it was just a friend thing. You looked back at Jonah right? That wasn\u2019t a friend thing. It wasn\u2019t for me either, or Amber, or anyone we know.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUgh, crushes are hard, three hard five me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah tell me about it.\u201d Buffy said, not realizing what she said.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaat?\u201d Cyrus beamed.</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Marty isn\u2019t it?\u201d Andi wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know- wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait really!?\u201d Andi squealed again.

        "body": "<p>Tyronious sat on the floor of their playroom coloring in his favorite coloring book. He had all the crayons lined up above the book in rainbow order. He\u2019s currently coloring a picture of a dinosaur for his best friend ever, Cyrus. They met in daycare and they both love dinosaurs and Tyronious wants to make him the most perfect dinosaur. Also, Cyrus gave him a cookie last time they were in daycare and he wanted to give him something in return. He\u2019s planning on giving Cyrus the picture when they are at the swing set at playtime. All he has to do is make sure Rebelli doesn\u2019t mess it up.</p>\n\n<p>As Tyronious finished up with the blue crayon, he put it in his place and grabbed the orange. Rebelli ran into the run, waving his superhero action figure in the air. He passed Tyronious and accidentally knock the crayons out of order. Tyronious started crying and flailing on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious kicked and screamed. \u201cRebelli! You messed it up!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWha?\u201d Rebelli asked as he continued to play with his action figure. He ran around the room and accidentally ran over his little brother\u2019s drawing. The page crumbled, which caused Tyronious to freak out even more.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMonster! You messed my drawing up! It for Cyrus!\u201d Tyronious screamed as he got up and started to hit his brother. Since Tyronious was smaller and weaker, Rebelli didn\u2019t feel it and continued playing. \u201cYou the worstest brother!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you the worstest. You never wanna play. All you do is draw and talk about Cyrus.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe my friend. I was making him a drawing to give him and you messed it up!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli picked up the coloring book and waved it in the air. Tyronious stopped in place and stared at the book as his mouth was wide open. \u201cPut it down!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli ran out the room, still holding the book. His brother followed him. The two ended up in the bathroom with Rebelli standing on top of the bathtub, dangling the book over the toilet. Tyronious is standing in the doorway. Rebelli smirked. \u201cTake a step. I dare you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious teetered back and forth. He knew his bother was mean sometimes, but never has he destroyed one of his things on purpose. He jumped to reach the book, however, Rebelli dropped it in the toilet as he saw him move. The book hit the water as Tyronious nearly had it and fell to the floor. He laid there and cried harder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMonster!\u201d Tyronious cried into the floor. He got up and rubs his eyes. \u201cI tell daddy!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo no no no no no! Please!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious took a deep breath. \u201cDADDY!!!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Seconds later, their dad entered the bathroom. He noticed his sons and nearly raised his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious points at his brother. \u201cHim! He put my coloring book in toilet.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Their dad looking inside and took out the book. He grabbed Rebelli with his other hand and carried him out across his shoulder. \u201cTime out time for you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Later that day, Tyronious is working on a different coloring book. He ran out of green and yellow crayons and left the play room to get the extra pack of crayons from the living room.</p>\n\n<p>Upon entering the living room, he sees Rebelli standing in the corner. He smiles and runs back into the play room, after getting the extra crayons from the living room toy box.</p>\n\n<p>When he re-enters the play room, he finds Rebelli\u2019s superhero toy on the floor. He picked it up and examined it. He started tugging some of the parts until he decided to rip off one of the arms. He tosses the piece of plastic across the room. He repeats the process with one of the legs. He soon hears someone coming up the stairs and laves to his bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious manages to get on his bed and under the covers barely before hearing a loud scream. He recognizes it as his brother. He starts to giggle, but it slowly stops when he hears another person run up the stairs. Now he knows that it\u2019s his father. Although the play room is next door his room, he could faintly hear the conversation his dad and brother were having.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing he knew was his father entering his room and removing the covers. His father grabbed his hand and pulled him up. \u201cTime out time.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An hour later, Tyronious was free from time out and is in his room. He has a little tv that his parents bought him and was currently watching Spongebob. He got so lost in the show that he almost didn\u2019t hear his father\u2019s screaming.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cREBELLI JONES! TYRONIOUS JACKSON! Get in here now!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious and Rebelli came out of the rooms and pouted at each other as they met at the stairs. They walked down together. They entered the living to see their dad redder than he has ever been. His hands were crossed, and he was pacing the room. \u201cEither of you want to explain that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He pointed at the wall. There was a huge scribble mess done in markers that covered half the wall. Both boys gasp.</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli pointed at Tyronious. \u201cHim, daddy. He said he making picture for his friend. He must use markers. You know he get to excited.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Their father kneels in front of Tyronious. The way he spoke sounds like a mix of anger and concern. \u201cTyronious, you know the rules. Nothing to draw other than with crayons, and never draw on the wall. You realize you\u2019re in a lot of trouble.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut, daddy. I-\u201c Tyronious tried to explain, but his tears got him choked up. His hiccups weren\u2019t helping either. \u201cI would never-.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo excuses. You know the rules. And you also know that serious crimes come with serious punishment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious\u2019 face dropped when he realized that he\u2019s about to be spanked. He never gotten spanked before. He saw it happen to Rebelli a few times and was determined to never have that happen. He is now trying to cover his back side with his hands. \u201cDaddy, no!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Their father took his hand and led him to the couch. Tyronious cried and flailed as he tried to let go. Rebelli watched and watch shaking. He knew his brother was innocent but was mad at him for breaking his favorite toy. He didn\u2019t intend for him to get spanked.</p>\n\n<p>As their father placed Tyronious across his knee, Rebelli approached them. \u201cDada, it was me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI colored the wall. I blame brother. I was mad he broke my toy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRebelli Jones Kippen.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli started tearing up as he heard his full name. Their parents only did that when they were seriously angry and were about to be severely punished. \u201cIt ok, daddy. I know I need to be spanked.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious managed to get to the floor. He hugged his brother as he teared up too. \u201cI still love you. You my brother forever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Their dad smiled at the sight in front of him. Both of his sons seemed to care for each other. He didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment my punishing either one. \u201cBoys, listen up. There will be no spanking today, but I do expect you two to help clean up the mess.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Both boys said as they then hugged their dad.</p>\n\n<p>The three Kippen guys spent the next hour scrubbing the wall. The two children would often splash some water on each other, which would receive a glance from their dad. After cleaning the mess, the three of them laid out on the couch and watched The Land Before Time. Tyronious and Rebelli fell asleep on either side of their father.</p>",

He\u2019s currently coloring a picture of a dinosaur for his best friend ever, Cyrus. They met in daycare and they both love dinosaurs and Tyronious wants to make him the most perfect dinosaur. Also, Cyrus gave him a cookie last time they were in daycare and he wanted to give him something in return. He\u2019s planning on giving Cyrus the picture when they are at the swing set at playtime. All he has to do is make sure Rebelli doesn\u2019t mess it up.</p>\n\n<p>As Tyronious finished up with the blue crayon, he put it in his place and grabbed the orange. Rebelli ran into the run, waving his superhero action figure in the air. He passed Tyronious and accidentally knock the crayons out of order. Tyronious started crying and flailing on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious kicked and screamed. \u201cRebelli! You messed it up!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWha?\u201d Rebelli asked as he continued to play with his action figure. He ran around the room and accidentally ran over his little brother\u2019s drawing. The page crumbled, which caused Tyronious to freak out even more.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMonster! You messed my drawing up! It for Cyrus!\u201d Tyronious screamed as he got up and started to hit his brother. Since Tyronious was smaller and weaker, Rebelli didn\u2019t feel it and continued playing. \u201cYou the worstest brother!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you the worstest. You never wanna play. All you do is draw and talk about Cyrus.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe my friend. I was making him a drawing to give him and you messed it up!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli picked up the coloring book and waved it in the air. Tyronious stopped in place and stared at the book as his mouth was wide open. \u201cPut it down!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Rebelli ran out the room, still holding the book. His brother followed him. The two ended up in the bathroom with Rebelli standing on top of the bathtub, dangling the book over the toilet. Tyronious is standing in the doorway. Rebelli smirked. \u201cTake a step. I dare you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious teetered back and forth. He knew his bother was mean sometimes, but never has he destroyed one of his things on purpose. He jumped to reach the book, however, Rebelli dropped it in the toilet as he saw him move. The book hit the water as Tyronious nearly had it and fell to the floor. He laid there and cried harder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMonster!\u201d Tyronious cried into the floor. He got up and rubs his eyes. \u201cI tell daddy!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo no no no no no! Please!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious took a deep breath. \u201cDADDY!!!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Seconds later, their dad entered the bathroom. He noticed his sons and nearly raised his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious points at his brother. \u201cHim! He put my coloring book in toilet.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Their dad looking inside and took out the book. He grabbed Rebelli with his other hand and carried him out across his shoulder. \u201cTime out time for you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Later that day, Tyronious is working on a different coloring book. He ran out of green and yellow crayons and left the play room to get the extra pack of crayons from the living room.</p>\n\n<p>Upon entering the living room, he sees Rebelli standing in the corner. He smiles and runs back into the play room, after getting the extra crayons from the living room toy box.</p>\n\n<p>When he re-enters the play room, he finds Rebelli\u2019s superhero toy on the floor. He picked it up and examined it. He started tugging some of the parts until he decided to rip off one of the arms. He tosses the piece of plastic across the room. He repeats the process with one of the legs. He soon hears someone coming up the stairs and laves to his bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>Tyronious manages to get on his bed and under the covers barely before hearing a loud scream. He recognizes it as his brother. He starts to giggle, but it slowly stops when he hears another person run up the stairs. Now he knows that it\u2019s his father. Although the play room is next door his room, he could faintly hear the conversation his dad and brother were having.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing he knew was his father entering his room and removing the covers. His father grabbed his hand and pulled him up. \u201cTime out time.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An hour later, Tyronious was free from time out and is in his room. He has a little tv that his parents bought him and was currently watching Spongebob. He got so lost in the show that he almost didn\u2019t hear his father\u2019s screaming.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cREBELLI JONES! TYRONIOUS JACKSON!

You don\u2019t need to watch Grey\u2019s Anatomy to read this fic.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p>It was barely six in the morning when Cyrus shuffled into The Pit, one hand wrapped around a\u00a0paper cup of coffee while the other sluggishly patted his pillow-mussed hair into shape. The sun was still making its slow ascent into the sky, spilling its morning glow across the ambulance bay outside, but Shadyside Hospital was already alive with people \u2013 patients and practitioners alike. As always, the air was buzzing with a frantic, suspenseful energy, but Cyrus had a feeling that today\u2019s shift was going to be even crazier than usual.</p><p>As soon as he spotted Andi and Buffy standing next to a row of gurneys\u00a0on the side of the room, Cyrus downed the last of his coffee, dumped his cup in the nearest bin, and dragged himself across The Pit to join them. His presence was met with a couple of weary nods.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Cy,\u201d Andi greeted him, blinking her tired eyes open as she attempted a small smile. \u201cSleep well?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus groaned. \u201cToo well\u2026 I didn\u2019t wanna leave my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are depressing,\u201d Buffy said with the quirk of an eyebrow. Despite the dark smudges beneath her eyes, she seemed relatively well-rested, and Cyrus envied her for it. \u201cWhose service are you on today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d Cyrus said. He stifled a yawn with the back of his hand and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be stuck in the clinic again, knowing my luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clinic isn\u2019t\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grunt work, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Buffy opened her mouth to protest, then changed her mind, probably deciding it was too early in the morning for a debate. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. It isn\u2019t great in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never worked a\u00a0<i>day</i>\u00a0in the clinic,\u201d Andi said, shooting Buffy a teasing glare. \u201cThe residents probably fight over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault everyone wants me on their service.\u201d Buffy cracked her knuckles and grinned, playfully rolling her eyes at Andi\u2019s unimpressed expression. \u201cOh, don\u2019t look at me like that\u2026 You\u2019re the one\u00a0<i>dating\u00a0</i>a resident.\u201d</p><p>Andi folded her arms defensively. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked Amber to do me any favours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you have. But if anyone\u2019s got an advantage here, it\u2019s definitely you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop bickering,\u201d Cyrus pleaded, gingerly rubbing his temples to ease the pounding in his head. The bright lights of The Pit never failed to give him a headache, especially when he was still in the process of waking up. \u201cI would give anything to be put on radiology today,\u201d he continued groggily. \u201cSomewhere dark and quiet, where I could nap in peace\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy punched him in the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a surgical intern,\u201d she said, as if he needed reminding. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to\u00a0<i>nap</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Sleep is a thing of the past for people like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it!\u201d he exclaimed, flapping his arms like a bird caught in a net. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0<i>tired</i>. And when I\u2019m tired, I get cranky. And when I\u2019m cranky, I get dramatic. It\u2019s a vicious circle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you better reel it in,\u201d Buffy said, dropping her voice to an urgent whisper. \u201cDr. Metcalf\u2019s coming over.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds, the Chief of Surgery was looming over them, wearing his signature frown as he carefully surveyed the interns with a pair of sharp, judgemental eyes. After a few moments of tense silence, the older man wrinkled his nose and leaned back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you three have someplace to be?\u201d he asked, phrasing the question like a warning.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Metcalf,\u201d Andi and Buffy squeaked in unison, their eyes as wide as dinner plates. When Cyrus didn\u2019t say a word, they both turned to him with questioning looks of horror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually know whose service I\u2019m on today,\u201d he hurried to explain, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p>Dr. Metcalf sighed. \u201cThe incompetency of you interns is astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise. Just get to work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with the first resident you see for today. But don\u2019t let this kind of amateur mistake happen again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Dr. Metcalf walked away, Cyrus allowed himself to breathe again, his wobbly legs giving way as he slumped against Buffy\u2019s side for support.</p><p>\u201cI think I just peed myself.\u201d</p><p>Andi snorted. \u201cAre you okay, Cy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just traumatised. Nothing major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go again with the dramatics,\u201d Buffy said, shoving him off with a shrug. As she was pressing the crinkles out of her scrubs, her eyes landed on something across the room, and a devious smirk appeared on her lips. \u201cWell, I guess that answers the question of whose service you\u2019re on today.\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could ask any questions, Buffy grabbed his chin and turned his head to the right, pointing his gaze towards a dirty-blond man in dark blue scrubs standing at the opposite end of The Pit, his green eyes scrolling up and down the tablet in his hands.</p><p><i>TJ Kippen</i>. Or, as Buffy and Andi liked to call him,\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u2019 big fat crush</i>.</p><!-- more --><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head as he took a step backwards, accidentally stumbling into a (thankfully) empty bed. \u201cI can\u2019t work with that guy\u2026 No way!\u201d</p><p>Andi sidled up to Buffy with a matching smirk. \u201cDr. Metcalf\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>tell you to go with the first resident you see. You don\u2019t want to disobey the Chief of Surgery, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s a\u00a0<i>fellow</i>\u00a0\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2013 and I can just pretend I never saw him,\u201d Cyrus said, frantically scanning The Pit for any signs of another resident. The room was swarming with pale blue scrubs and white coats, but TJ Kippen was the only spot of darkness in sight. It was hopeless. \u201cI can\u2019t spend the entire day one-to-one with him,\u201d Cyrus insisted. \u201cWhat if he \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinks at you again?\u201d Buffy suggested, biting back a grin as Andi smothered her giggles with the sleeve of her coat. \u201cOh, the horror!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only flirting with you,\u201d Andi said, taking a deep breath to compose herself. \u201cMaybe he likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy!\u201d Cyrus hissed, instant heat rushing to his cheeks as a couple of heads turned their way. As soon as the attention had shifted away from them, he lowered his voice and continued, \u201cA guy\u2019s never flirted with me before. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him down gently.\u201d Andi flicked a glance at Buffy, her eyebrows raised in a silent question, then turned back to Cyrus with a shrug. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want to, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blanched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 You do talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Buffy said, scraping her hair into a bun on top of her head. The pager at her hip started buzzing as soon as she dropped her arms, and she answered it without hesitation. \u201cWell, I wish I could stay here and talk some sense into you all morning, but some of us have work to do.\u201d And with that, she pinched his cheek and made her way towards the double doors leading to the rest of the hospital, turning at the last second to give him a thumbs up. \u201cJust go with your gut,\u201d she shouted across The Pit. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, when the bustling crowds slowly started to thin out, Andi bit her lip and sighed. \u201cI better get going too,\u201d she said, offering Cyrus a sympathetic smile as he desperately clung to her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cy. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cBut\u2026 What if I don\u2019t\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0what I want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now\u2019s your chance to figure it out.\u201d She patted his hand and kissed his cheek, giving him a moment to gather his nerves, then pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, a sickly pallor washing his cheeks as he forced himself to nod. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>With Andi and Buffy both gone, and the rest of the interns slowly trickling out of The Pit, Cyrus had no choice but to force his jellified legs across the room and formally introduce himself. Besides a few snatched looks across the operation table, and a couple of unexpected winks thrown his way in passing, he and TJ had never really interacted before. Cyrus had always tried to keep his distance, afraid of what he might do if he were left alone with the frustratingly charming paediatrician for too long. But apparently, he couldn\u2019t avoid the other man forever.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Hello,\u201d Cyrus said as he approached TJ, anxiously wringing his hands together. He could already feel the nervous sweat beading on his skin, and his face was practically starting to smoke as the blush in his cheeks grew darker and darker, almost reaching the tips of his ears by the time TJ finally turned around and acknowledged him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the fellow greeted him, the corner of his mouth twitching with a smirk of recognition. \u201cAre you on my service today?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat. \u201cNot exactly, but\u2026 I-I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019m supposed to be, so Dr. Metcalf told me to go with the first resident I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you picked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I-I mean\u2026 I saw you\u00a0<i>first</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s gaze skipped over him \u2013 from the toes of his tennis shoes, all the way up to the unartfully-tousled mop of hair on top of his head \u2013 and finally settled on the spot between his eyes. After a moment of consideration, he made a humming noise and took a step closer, his flirtatious smile almost brushing against the shell of Cyrus\u2019 ear.</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A bolt of attraction pierced through Cyrus\u2019 chest, taking him by surprise. He tore his eyes away from TJ and coughed into his fist, internally begging the heat in his face to finally subside, before it melted the skin off his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d TJ observed, sounding genuinely concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded a little too enthusiastically. \u201cYes! I\u2019m fine, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve never done, um\u2026 p-paediatrics\u2026 before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, probably wondering if Cyrus had deliberately injected as much implication as possible into that sentence, then gave him a friendly clap on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Yes. Exactly. Um\u2026 Thank you, TJ. I mean\u2026\u00a0<i>Dr. Kippen</i>. Sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d TJ said, his eyes twinkling with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re Cyrus, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to familiarise myself with all the interns. Especially the cute ones.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered a nervous laugh and ducked his head, studiously avoiding TJ\u2019s eyes. He hadn\u2019t expected the fellow to be so forward with his flirting. A couple of winks in the corridor was one thing, but face-to-face compliments? He hadn\u2019t prepared himself for that. How was he supposed to respond?</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d TJ said, as if he could sense the mental breakdown currently taking place inside his mind. \u201cI\u2019m only messing with you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that didn\u2019t make him feel any better. If anything, it made him feel worse.\u00a0<i>Disappointed</i>. Did TJ flirt like this with all the interns? Was Cyrus nothing more than an easily-flustered nerd for him to play games with? Or was he completely overthinking this and acting like an idiot? It was probably the latter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, smiling and exhaling at the same time. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little on edge.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cLittle kids aren\u2019t that scary, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the parents I\u2019m most worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u00a0<i>that\u2019s\u00a0</i>a legitimate fear.\u201d</p><p>The two of them shared a smile, and Cyrus could feel the blush finally draining from his cheeks. When he wasn\u2019t overanalysing every little thing TJ did, the man wasn\u2019t too difficult to get along with. He was actually pretty nice. And\u2026 handsome? There was no point in denying it, especially inside his own head. TJ Kippen was a very handsome man, and Cyrus was at least 60% attracted to him. Maybe even more. Well,\u00a0<i>definitely\u00a0</i>more, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Cyrus had never felt so comfortable about his sexuality \u2013 a thing only he, Buffy, and Andi were aware of \u2013 before. It was refreshing.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get a move on,\u201d TJ said, glancing down at his pager. When he looked back up at Cyrus, his usual smirk had fallen into place again. \u201cThere\u2019s a broken arm with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Yay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the enthusiasm.\u201c TJ gave him a quick wink, then spun on his heels and marched towards the doors. With his considerably long legs, it only took him a few strides to reach the other end of The Pit, leaving Cyrus standing by himself with his mouth hanging open. \u201cFollow me, intern!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus scrambled after him, the tail of his too-long coat slapping against the backs of his thighs as he rushed across the room. For the next few minutes, he followed TJ through the hospital, slipping through dense crowds and dodging incoming trolleys and wheelchairs as TJ seamlessly glided down the corridors. He clearly knew his way around the hospital, and Cyrus didn\u2019t know whether to be impressed or intimidated.</p><p>\u201cYou still with me?\u201d TJ asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Cyrus shouted a breathless \u201cYes\u201d in response, almost running straight into the fellow\u2019s back as he came to a sudden stop.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Cyrus muttered under his breath.</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile. He was standing with his arms folded in an authoritative kind of stance, but Cyrus could see the childlike excitement brimming beneath the surface. He obviously adored his job, and he couldn\u2019t wait to share it with someone. Cyrus was just glad he got to be that lucky someone.</p><p>\u201cThis is this paediatrics ward,\u201d TJ said, tapping a few things on his tablet as he swept Cyrus into a large room covered in stickers, paintings, and colourful posters.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cyrus said, his heart fluttering at TJ\u2019s responding grin.</p><p>\u201cImpressive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the paintings were made by the kids,\u201d TJ explained as he guided Cyrus deeper into the room, taking a left at the end of the beds and down a corridor flanked by private rooms, some of them with crudely decorated nameplates hanging on the doors. \u201cPainting seems to relax them, you know? The parents, too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the back of TJ\u2019s head, privately admiring the obvious affection the fellow had for his patients. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s a few budding artists in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d TJ huffed a laugh. \u201cSome of these kids are scarily talented. All of them, really, in their own little ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really care about them, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ paused, his back still turned to Cyrus. The stiff set of the fellow\u2019s shoulders made him worry he\u2019d said something wrong, but when TJ turned to face him, his eyes were as bright as the radiant smile dimpling his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cWorking here\u2026 I\u2019ve seen some stuff that\u2019s changed me, made me wanna throw in the towel and get out of medicine altogether. It\u2019s not always easy, taking the responsibility of a child\u2019s life into your hands.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face, a shuddering breath passing between his fingers. \u201cBut then I think of all the kids I\u2019ve saved, all the ones that still pay me visits and send me thank you cards, and it makes everything else worth it. The bad times. The\u00a0<i>hard\u00a0</i>times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWorking in paediatrics is the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, his fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and comfort the other man. But then TJ blinked, and the unshed tears in his eyes were replaced by a familiar hint of playful arrogance that made Cyrus\u2019 heart stutter with uncontrollable desire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry for the sob story,\u201d TJ said, flashing him a smile. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t control myself around cute guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered. \u201cWait, what? Are you telling me that was just an elaborate pickup line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was true,\u201d TJ said, his lips twitching as he fought back a smirk. \u201cI really\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0love the kids here, and working in paediatrics really\u00a0<i>is\u00a0</i>the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. But I need to exaggerate it a little bit for the guys, you know? The sad, brooding doctor act\u00a0<i>never\u00a0</i>fails to work wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 kinda messed up.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNah. The kids here are constantly bugging me about my love life. They\u2019re kinda like my mini wingmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d Cyrus said, but his words were light with laughter. There was something quite endearing about the thought of TJ\u2019s patients being so invested in finding him a boyfriend. But he still couldn\u2019t ignore the dull pang of jealousy deep down in his stomach when he pictured TJ recycling the same, meaningless lines on a bunch of other guys who weren\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cYou say sick, I say smart. Agree to disagree?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes and smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said a word. They just stood there in silence, barely inches apart in the near-empty corridor, and smiled at each other. But then a child started crying a few rooms down, effectively ruining the moment, and they both sprung apart, staring down at the floor and rubbing the backs of their necks like a couple of guilty teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, um\u2026. We should probably stop chatting and actually do some work,\u201d TJ said. There was a light dusting of pink on his cheeks, the closest Cyrus had ever seen the fellow to getting flustered, but other than that, he seemed completely unaffected by the unshifting tension in the air. \u201cYou ready to start?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The next few hours passed in a blur of wailing children and anxious parents, all of them with an abundance of questions that Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Luckily, TJ was always by his side, offering his support whenever he noticed Cyrus struggling. When the fellow was totally immersed in his job, and not trying to woo Cyrus with dazzling smiles and wry comments, he was actually a very gentle and patient person, and Cyrus found himself falling deeper and deeper for the other man as the seconds ticked by.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with kids,\u201d he blurted out at one point, after TJ had given a little girl a lollipop in exchange for her sitting still for an injection. When TJ looked at him, clearly taken aback by the unexpected compliment, Cyrus felt his face flush. \u201cI mean\u2026 You definitely made the right career choice.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s surprise softened into fondness, his eyes flicking curiously over Cyrus\u2019 pinkening face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself, you know?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d TJ said, placing a steady hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u00a0<i>More\u00a0</i>than great.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the touch of TJ\u2019s fingertips, Cyrus\u2019 skin sizzled and ached with longing. It seeped into his veins and punctured his heart, oozing a strange combination of fear and excitement that flooded his chest with warmth.</p><p>\u201cThank you, TJ,\u201d he said, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>They were standing so close that TJ could probably feel the heat of Cyrus\u2019 blush in the tight space between them. If it weren\u2019t for the little girl happily sucking on the strawberry lollipop in her bed right next to them, Cyrus might\u2019ve done something stupid, like lean forward and kiss the other man. In fact, he might\u2019ve kissed him anyway \u2013 privacy be damned \u2013 if one the attendings hadn\u2019t suddenly appeared and stolen the fellow away from him.</p><p>While TJ was going over some charts with the attending in the corner of the room, occasionally glancing over the elderly woman\u2019s shoulder and meeting his eyes with a secret smile, Cyrus busied himself by smoothing the sheets at the end of the little girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your lollipop?\u201d he asked her, trying his best to ignore the heat of TJ\u2019s distant gaze.</p><p>The girl swung her head up and down. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re braver than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be terrified of needles when I was your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cYeah, well\u2026 I\u2019m a doctor in training. But the needles still freak me out a little bit.\u201d He glanced around the room, pretending to make sure no one could hear them, then leaned across the bed and pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s our little secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>The girl giggled and nodded, using her lollipop to draw an invisible cross over her heart. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a star.\u201d Cyrus lifted his hand, and the girl slapped a high-five onto his palm. \u201cMaybe you can teach me how to be as brave as\u00a0<i>you\u00a0</i>are someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>When he turned away from the bed, Cyrus was surprised to find TJ watching him from across the room, his eyes lidded softly. Despite the attending still yapping in his ear, TJ\u2019s attention was fixed solely on him, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t seem to wrangle himself free from the fellow\u2019s unwavering gaze. Probably because he didn\u2019t want to. It felt nice to have someone look at him like that, even if it was just a well-rehearsed act for flirting with random men.</p><p><i>It doesn\u2019t feel like an act</i>, a voice whispered in his heart.</p><p>Cyrus sucked in a deep breath, still staring intensely at TJ, then allowed himself to smile. It felt dangerous, succumbing to this, but he didn\u2019t care. Especially when TJ returned his smile with a boyish grin that made his eyes dance like scattered sunlight cascading through the trees.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening?\u201d he heard the attending say.</p><p>TJ tore his eyes away from Cyrus and cleared his throat. \u201cSorry, yes. Go on\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>As the attending continued to ramble, TJ flicked one last smirk across the room, and Cyrus felt his heart soar. It was like being back in High School, passing suggestive notes under the desk and grinning like an idiot every time your hands brushed.</p><p>\u201cI think Dr. Kippen likes you,\u201d the little girl said, leaning across the bed to poke Cyrus in the arm. Her strawberry-tinted lips were stretched into an impish smile. \u201cDo you like him back?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed furiously. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix and three quarters,\u201d the girl said, sitting up straight to make herself seem bigger.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cyrus reached forward and ruffled her hair. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re\u00a0<i>quite\u00a0</i>old enough to understand \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks at you the way my daddy looks at my mommy,\u201d the girl interjected, jutting out her chin defiantly. \u201cHe never looks at other boys like that. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his stomach drop. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d The girl ripped the lollipop out of her mouth and waved it impatiently in the air. \u201cDo you like him or not?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus risked a glance across the room. Even from this distance, he could still appreciate the fellow\u2019s profile \u2013 the long slope of his nose; the sandy swoop of his hair; the delicate curve of his smile\u2026 There was no denying how handsome TJ was, just as there was no denying his ever-deepening feelings for the other man.</p><p>\u201cYes, I like him,\u201d Cyrus admitted with a sigh of defeat. \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>By the time Cyrus dragged himself into the interns\u2019 locker room at the end of his shift, it was verging on ten o\u2019clock, the crisp morning light he\u2019d last seen filtering through the boxy window at the back of the room now reduced to a deep, almost inky black. It was a few weeks shy of winter, and the nights were now long, dark, and cold. He was almost tempted to return to the paediatrics ward, where the corridors were bright and warm, and TJ\u2019s dazzling smile was there to keep him company. But after sixteen hours of stitching gashes, poking needles, and splinting broken bones \u2013 all the while trying not to spontaneously combust every time TJ so much as looked at him \u2013 all he really wanted to do was go home and get some rest.</p><p>He was pulling a dark green sweater over his head when someone else came through the door, silencing the idle chatter of the interns dotted around the room. Confused, Cyrus wriggled his head into the light and peered around the lockers, barely containing a gasp when he saw TJ standing in the doorway. The moment their eyes met, the fellow turned to the other interns and swapped his easy smile for an intimidating glare.</p><p>\u201cClear the room,\u201d he said, the commanding tone of his voice leaving no room for argument. \u201cI need to have a word with Goodman.\u201d</p><p>It only took a handful of seconds for the interns to follow orders, all of them practically tripping over each other in their haste to get out of the room. When the last of them had disappeared, leaving him and TJ alone, the fellow closed the door and joined Cyrus by the lockers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2026 I wanted to talk to you before you left.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tugged nervously at the hem of his sweater. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you how great you were today,\u201d TJ said, stammering slightly as a light blush crept up his neck and blotted his jawline. It was strangely comforting to see a hint of nerves amongst his seemingly limitless supply of confidence; it made him seem more human, and therefore more obtainable. \u201cYou should be really proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Cyrus said, nibbling at the shy smile slowly blooming across his face. A beat of silence passed, and he took a step closer to TJ, daring a glance at the other man\u2019s face \u2013 so close, it was almost blurred. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came here,\u201d he added, his voice breathy. \u201cI wanted to thank you, for being such a good teacher.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s my\u00a0<i>job</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take the compliment,\u201d Cyrus said, rolling his eyes with a teasing smile. \u201cYou were great, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, TJ\u2019s face fell slack, and Cyrus was worried he\u2019d overstepped somehow. But then the fellow swallowed thickly, his throat rippling, and reached out to touch Cyrus\u2019 arm, tugging him forward slowly, cautiously, giving him the option to resist if he wanted to\u2026 But saying no to this was the\u00a0<i>last\u00a0</i>thing he wanted, so he stayed where he was, eyes falling closed and lips parting slightly, waiting for the warm pressure of TJ\u2019s mouth against his own. And when it finally arrived, the breath hitching in his throat and stars swimming behind his eyelids, it was everything he\u2019d hoped for and more.\u00a0<i>So much more</i>.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he mumbled as they pulled apart, his hands fisting in the lapels of TJ\u2019s coat. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnexpected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed, breathless and giddy. \u201cBut, also no.\u201d</p><p>TJ lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have been flirting with me or a while now. I mean, you\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to respond to subtlety,\u201d TJ said, smirking slightly as his fingers brushed the back of Cyrus\u2019 neck, \u201cso I had to kick it up a notch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He placed a hand on TJ\u2019s chest and chuckled, already leaning in for another kiss. \u201cYou really\u00a0<i>are\u00a0</i>a good teacher\u2026\u201d</p><p>Before their lips could connect for a second time, TJ pulled away, the warmth of his fingers slipping from Cyrus\u2019 neck. \u201cAre we still talking about paediatrics?\u201d he asked, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus said, winking clumsily. \u201cAmongst other things.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in once again, but TJ rebuffed him, his lips thinning into a grimace as he loosened Cyrus\u2019 grip on his coat. \u201cHang on,\u201d he said, keeping Cyrus an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cWas\u2026 Was that your first kiss with a guy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus winced. \u201cIs that problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You said you wanted to teach me,\u201d Cyrus said. He heard the desperation in his own voice and cringed, a distant echo of shame pounding in his ears. He clenched his fists and tried again. \u201cYou said you would teach me, and I\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d TJ closed his eyes and inhaled through his noise, like he was trying to keep his temper in check. When he opened them again, Cyrus saw the pity staring back at him and shrank away, embarrassed and ashamed and\u00a0<i>confused</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, Cyrus. And I like you. I really do, but\u2026 I\u2019ve done my coming out already. I can\u2019t go through that again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new to this. I get that. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to figure yourself out and everything. But I don\u2019t wanna be a part of it.\u201d He shook his head and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t teach you how to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help with paediatrics? I\u2019m there. But not with this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hunched his shoulders, a flash of anger slicing through the muddle of emotions storming inside his chest. \u201cSo, what? I\u2019m not\u00a0<i>experienced\u00a0</i>enough for you? Is that it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d TJ exclaimed, tearing a hand through his hair. The violent swipe of his fingers ruffled the gel-stiffened waves, fluffing them out and sending locks of hair flopping over his forehead. He looked much better like that, despite everything. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna help you out of the closet, okay? That\u2019s something you\u2019ve gotta do by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d TJ said grimly. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve spent years learning to accept yourself, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d Cyrus said, sniffing back tears.</p><p>TJ cocked his head in agreement. \u201cFair enough. But that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d He flitted his eyes over Cyrus\u2019 face once more, his breath catching in hesitation, then finally turned around. With his hand on the door, he flicked a parting glance over his shoulder and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, he was gone.</p><p>~~ ~~~</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass,\u201d Buffy said, crushing an empty can of soda in her fist with one squeeze. Outside, the rain was screaming and whirling like an angry spirit, and the three of them were waiting it out in the cafeteria. \u201cDo you want me to talk to him? Beat him up for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cThanks, Buffy\u2026 But, no. I just wanna forget about him altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem really upset,\u201d Andi said softly.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really liked him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged in frustration. Not at Andi, but at himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let myself fall for someone like TJ Kippen. I mean, he probably flirts with anything that moves! I should\u2019ve known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Buffy assured him. \u201cHe led you on, Cyrus. We all saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI thought he actually liked me. It\u00a0<i>felt\u00a0</i>like he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe manipulated you.\u201d</p><p>Andi frowned. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Buffy said, her eyebrows lifting incredulously. \u201cHe\u2019s been flirting with Cyrus for weeks, and the moment he had him where he wanted him, he changed his mind. It was all just a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to come out,\u201d Andi shot back, making Buffy flinch in surprise. \u201cWhen Amber asked me out, I was a mess. I\u2019d never been with another girl before. And if it hadn\u2019t been for her patience and understanding \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2013 we probably wouldn\u2019t be together right now. But it isn\u2019t so easy for everyone.\u201d She turned away from Buffy and took Cyrus\u2019 hand, sweeping a comforting thumb over his knuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how difficult it was for TJ to come out. It might not be something he wants to revisit, and you asking him to walk you through the basics of being gay isn\u2019t gonna help that.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus balked. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I wanted! I just\u2026 I wanted to learn from him because I\u00a0<i>like\u00a0</i>him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Andi said. \u201cYou wanted him to teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest with yourself, Cy. Try and see things from TJ\u2019s point of view.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought back to their conversation in the locker room, how quickly TJ\u2019s softness had hardened into rejection the moment he\u2019d realised how inexperienced Cyrus was, the distance in his eyes when he\u2019d turned him down\u2026 He didn\u2019t want to be Cyrus\u2019 teacher. That much was obvious. But what if the rest of it had been real? What if Cyrus really\u00a0<i>was\u00a0</i>the one in the wrong here?</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he whispered to himself, the blood draining from his face as realisation dawned on him. \u201cHe thought I was using him.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled knowingly. \u201cAnd you thought\u00a0<i>he\u00a0</i>was using\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a second,\u201d Buffy interrupted, wagging a finger in the air as she struggled to catch up. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus thought TJ rejected him because he was inexperienced,\u201d Andi explained in a slow, patronising tone of voice. She was clearly enjoying being ahead of Buffy for once. \u201cBut TJ actually rejected him because he thought Cyrus was using him to\u00a0<i>gain\u00a0</i>experience. Do you get it now?\u201d</p><p>Buffy folded her arms and grumbled. \u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d Cyrus said, his mind still buzzing with a thousand fleeting thoughts, \u201che didn\u2019t need to turn me down so abruptly. I mean, he didn\u2019t even let me explain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d Andi squeezed his hand and smiled. \u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you? You said it yourself. And he likes you. I\u00a0<i>know\u00a0</i>he does. So why are you trying so hard to talk yourself out of this?\u201d She scooted closer across the bench and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t let a stupid misunderstanding ruin this for you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, a trembling bundle in his lap, and exhaled a shaky breath. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d he asked, the roaring of the rain outside almost swallowing his words. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me because he thinks I\u2019m na\u00efve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u00a0<i>would\u00a0</i>be an ass,\u201d Andi said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Buffy groaned. \u201cI hate to admit, but I think she\u2019s right\u2026 I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. There\u2019s no faking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a guy before,\u201d Cyrus whimpered, stating what they both already knew. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m bad at it? What if I\u00a0<i>do\u00a0</i>need someone to teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay,\u201d Buffy said simply. \u201cYou don\u2019t need someone to teach you what you already know.\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could protest any further, one of the doors leading outside opened with a heavy\u00a0<i>thump</i>, and TJ came stumbling into the cafeteria, thoroughly soaked to the bone. There was water streaming down his face, a sheet of dark blond hair covering his eyes, and his scrubs were completely sodden. Cyrus could do nothing but watch in stunned silence as the fellow shook himself out like a large dog and blindly collapsed into a nearby chair. It was only when he swept the hair out of his eyes that he noticed Cyrus watching him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI, um\u2026 I\u2019ll go somewhere else \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d Buffy asked him, her expression flitting between amused and repulsed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s pouring it down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very smart for a fellow, are you?\u201d</p><p>TJ gave her a tight, acidic smile. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t been here long, intern, but not every ward in this hospital is conveniently connected by corridors.\u201d</p><p>Buffy simply glowered in response.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, guys,\u201d Andi said, smiling nervously as she attempted to smooth things over. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults, aren\u2019t we? I\u2019m sure we can sit here without arguing until the rain stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d TJ scraped back his chair and got to his feet, the soles of his shoes squeaking against the wet floor. For a brief moment, his eyes landed on Cyrus, but they quickly danced away and returned to the rain lashing against the windows instead. \u201cWish me luck, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was standing before he\u2019d even decided to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, the rain \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little water\u2019s not gonna hurt me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut losing TJ will.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gagged. \u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re in love and everything, but there was no need for that level of cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Andi said, beaming as she reached out and squeezed Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cGo get him, Cy!\u201d</p><p>As soon as he opened the door, the rain hit him like a thousand flecks of ice, instantly raising the hair on his arms and turning his cheeks a deep, stinging shade of pink. But there was no going back now. He could see TJ\u2019s retreating form just ahead, quickly fading in the grey smudge of rain sweeping across his vision. If he didn\u2019t move now, he would lose him, and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able find the courage to confront him like this again.</p><p>So he ran.</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d The wind picked up his words and tossed them into the sky, becoming one with the rain and sinking into the wet earth beneath his feet. \u201cTJ, wait!\u201d</p><p>With his nose buried in the crook of his arm to shield his face from the storm, he chased after the distant speck of white with all the energy he could muster. By the time his hand latched onto the soggy tail of TJ\u2019s coat, his legs were burning, despite the rain leeching through his scrubs, and he could barely breathe enough air into his lungs to spit out a single word. But, luckily, TJ didn\u2019t shove him away like he\u2019d expected him to. He stood there, quiet and grim, as Cyrus caught his breath, seemingly indifferent to the darkening clouds above their heads, and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I need\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re only making this harder, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand?\u201d he asked, spraying Cyrus with droplets of rain as he whipped around to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re new to the whole coming out thing. You wanna have some fun, figure yourself out\u2026 I get it. But I\u2019m not interested in playing a one-time part in your journey to self-discovery. I want something that\u2019s gonna last, okay? A relationship that\u00a0<i>means\u00a0</i>something, for once. And you\u2019re obviously not looking for that kind of thing, so \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m looking for!\u201d Cyrus yelled. \u201cJust because I\u2019m inexperienced, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignorant. I\u2019ve known what I want for a very long time. And for some bizarre reason,\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0happen to be it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with one of my best friends when I was thirteen. I\u2019ve known I was gay for almost half my life. So don\u2019t you\u00a0<i>dare\u00a0</i>stand there and accuse me of not understanding the struggles of learning to accept yourself, because\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve\u00a0</i>lived it too! And just because I\u2019ve never been with another guy before, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not sure of who I am, or what I want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you don\u2019t want the responsibility of being my first boyfriend. Maybe you\u2019re scared it will be awkward and difficult and too much work.\u00a0<i>I understand that</i>. But that doesn\u2019t give you the right to jump to conclusions and ignore me!\u201d</p><p>At this point, TJ was smirking, and Cyrus could feel his anger rising and rising, like a pot of water close to boiling over.</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d the fellow asked, taking a step towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus shoved him away and growled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not done yet! Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done to me? I\u2019ve spent nearly thirteen years hiding from who I really am,\u00a0<i>terrified\u00a0</i>of getting hurt all over again. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long that I forgot what it felt like to be\u00a0<i>me</i>.\u201d He shook his head, half-choking on a sob. \u201cAnd then you kissed me, and I felt like I\u00a0<i>existed\u00a0</i>again.\u201d</p><p>TJ stopped smirking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this means to you. I don\u2019t know if you like flirting with me, and that\u2019s it, or if you actually wanna be with me. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I was a goner the moment you winked at me.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. It felt good to be honest. It felt like the rain - \u00a0crazy and reckless and\u00a0<i>real</i>. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m inexperienced. And awkward. And I tend to say the wrong things at the wrong times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m also nice. And loyal. And my friends think I\u2019m a catch. So if you still wanna turn me down, that\u2019s fine. But if you decide to give this a chance, you won\u2019t regret it, because \u2013\u201d</p><p>The rest of his words were swallowed by a kiss.</p><p>Cyrus made a little squawk of surprise as TJ\u2019s lips melted against his own, all of his pent up frustration seeping out of him within seconds, leaving him weightless and airy, elastic and free\u2026 He clutched onto TJ\u2019s shoulders and whimpered slightly, losing himself to the melodic\u00a0<i>whoosh\u00a0</i>of the rain as TJ pulled him impossibly closer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked me,\u201d he mumbled between kisses, gently tucking the hair behind Cyrus\u2019 ears. \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He cupped TJ\u2019s face and pressed their foreheads together, breathing him in. \u201cYou have nothing to apologise for. I\u2019m the idiot who made you think you were nothing more than a\u00a0<i>practice\u00a0</i>boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus froze, his face flushing darkly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me you didn\u2019t mean to call me your boyfriend, I\u2019m gonna be really upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2026 You\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>me to call you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, revealing the wicked slice of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019ve been flirting with you for a while now. And\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>is what usually comes after the flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u00a0<i>is</i>\u00a0this exactly?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, the confidence\u00a0in his smile not quite reaching his eyes. \u201cMe asking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>. Unless you don\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just chased you through a storm in nothing but scrubs and poured out my heart to you like we\u2019re in a Hallmark movie, and you honestly don\u2019t think I wanna be your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d he laughed, palming the back of TJ\u2019s neck and kissing him softly. All around them, the sky shivered and wept, bathing them in tears of joy as they clung onto each other for dear life,\u00a0laughing and hugging and basking in the rain.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus tugged the fleece blanket over his shoulders and tucked it under his chin, shuddering with relief as the heat pulsing from the radiator slowly filled the on-call room. He could still feel the occasional drop of rain rolling down his spine, but at least he could also feel his toes again. And the hot cocoa TJ had placed in his hands a few minutes ago was quickly thawing his icy palms as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d his said, lips trembling as he took a tentative sip from the steaming cup. The burn was delicious.</p><p>TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer, until he was practically sitting on his lap. Despite being equally soaked, TJ seemed to radiate warmth at all times, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t resist snuggling against his boyfriend\u2019s \u2013 yes,\u00a0<i>boyfriend\u2019s\u00a0</i>\u2013 chest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou smell like rain,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s quite nice, actually.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, ear pressed against the steady beating of TJ\u2019s heart. The sudden shift from freezing to cosy was taking its toll, making him feel sluggish and loose-lipped. He had no idea what he was going to say until the words tumbled out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you only kiss me to shut me up?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cHow could I\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0kiss you when you were being so damn cute?\u201d He threaded his fingers through Cyrus\u2019 hair, gently undoing all the frazzled knots left behind by the rain. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry for interrupting your Hallmark speech. What else were you gonna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was more or less done,\u201d Cyrus admitted. \u201cI was just gonna reassure you that you wouldn\u2019t have to go through the drama of coming out all over again.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, shifting on the bed so Cyrus was laying across his legs, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said the other day,\u201d he said quietly, his fingers resuming their careful exploration of Cyrus\u2019 hair. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be involved in another shame spiral, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not spiralling,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m definitely not ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He reached up and touched TJ\u2019s face, tracing the fine bones beneath his lightly-stubbled cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a sap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m just getting started\u2026\u201d</p><p>When their lips were mere inches apart, TJ\u2019s pager started buzzing at his hip, and Cyrus was caught between laughter and tears as he moved off the fellow\u2019s lap so he could check it. All he wanted to do was stay in this tiny room, with the lights low and the rain pattering against the window, and kiss his boyfriend. But when there were little kids with scraped knees and poorly tummies waiting for his assistance,\u00a0Cyrus didn\u2019t mind letting him go. This was the life they\u2019d both chosen for themselves, after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ huffed, already half-standing. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a sleepy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stay here and rest for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, TJ was gently prying the half-empty cup from his hands and lowering his head onto a pillow. Cyrus could hear the smile in his voice as he leaned over and kissed the sensitive spot behind his ear, whispering goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come find you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s being a sap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d TJ said simply, planting one last kiss on Cyrus\u2019 forehead as he got to his feet. \u00a0</p><p>Before he could leave, Cyrus grabbed onto his elbow and ushered him closer. TJ obliged with a fond little smile, crouching down beside the bed, and allowed Cyrus to kiss him on the lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too,\u201d Cyrus murmured softly, bumping their noses together.</p><p>After a few more parting kisses (with Cyrus promising each one would be the last) TJ managed to escape the on-call room, pausing briefly in the doorway to wave Cyrus goodbye and mockingly blow him a kiss. Joke or not, Cyrus still pretended to catch it mid-air and press it against his mouth, to which TJ blushed like a schoolboy and walked backwards into the wall, before stammering a final goodbye and disappearing down the corridor. Cyrus stared at the spot where the fellow had once stood until his eyelids began to droop closed. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d barely been asleep for five minutes when the door slammed open again, no doubt leaving a mark where it collided with the wall. His eyes sprang open as he sat bolt upright, only to find Buffy and Andi standing in the middle of the room, pointing at him accusingly with their mouths gaping open.</p><p>\u201cYou both look ridiculous,\u201d he said, collapsing back against his pillow.</p><p>\u201cWe saw you kissing TJ in the rain!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>Andi nodded in agreement. \u201cYes! We saw you through the window!\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u00a0</i>\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 We kissed. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr should we say, where\u2019s your\u00a0<i>boyfriend</i>?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cWell, considering TJ and I are dating now, I guess you\u00a0<i>should\u00a0</i>say that.\u201d</p><p>All at once, Buffy and Andi were crowded around him, jumping on the bed and shaking his arms as they bombarded him with a thousand overlapping questions. He didn\u2019t say a word, just sat there and soaked in the attention with a smug little smile, his thoughts slipping back to TJ. The dirty-blond in the dark blue scrubs.

Or, as Buffy and Andi liked to call him,\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u2019 big fat crush</i>.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head as he took a step backwards, accidentally stumbling into a (thankfully) empty bed. \u201cI can\u2019t work with that guy\u2026 No way!\u201d</p><p>Andi sidled up to Buffy with a matching smirk. \u201cDr. Metcalf\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>tell you to go with the first resident you see. You don\u2019t want to disobey the Chief of Surgery, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s a\u00a0<i>fellow</i>\u00a0\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2013 and I can just pretend I never saw him,\u201d Cyrus said, frantically scanning The Pit for any signs of another resident. The room was swarming with pale blue scrubs and white coats, but TJ Kippen was the only spot of darkness in sight. It was hopeless. \u201cI can\u2019t spend the entire day one-to-one with him,\u201d Cyrus insisted. \u201cWhat if he \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinks at you again?\u201d Buffy suggested, biting back a grin as Andi smothered her giggles with the sleeve of her coat. \u201cOh, the horror!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only flirting with you,\u201d Andi said, taking a deep breath to compose herself. \u201cMaybe he likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy!\u201d Cyrus hissed, instant heat rushing to his cheeks as a couple of heads turned their way. As soon as the attention had shifted away from them, he lowered his voice and continued, \u201cA guy\u2019s never flirted with me before. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him down gently.\u201d Andi flicked a glance at Buffy, her eyebrows raised in a silent question, then turned back to Cyrus with a shrug. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want to, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blanched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 You do talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Buffy said, scraping her hair into a bun on top of her head. The pager at her hip started buzzing as soon as she dropped her arms, and she answered it without hesitation. \u201cWell, I wish I could stay here and talk some sense into you all morning, but some of us have work to do.\u201d And with that, she pinched his cheek and made her way towards the double doors leading to the rest of the hospital, turning at the last second to give him a thumbs up. \u201cJust go with your gut,\u201d she shouted across The Pit. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, when the bustling crowds slowly started to thin out, Andi bit her lip and sighed. \u201cI better get going too,\u201d she said, offering Cyrus a sympathetic smile as he desperately clung to her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cy. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cBut\u2026 What if I don\u2019t\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0what I want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now\u2019s your chance to figure it out.\u201d She patted his hand and kissed his cheek, giving him a moment to gather his nerves, then pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, a sickly pallor washing his cheeks as he forced himself to nod. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>With Andi and Buffy both gone, and the rest of the interns slowly trickling out of The Pit, Cyrus had no choice but to force his jellified legs across the room and formally introduce himself. Besides a few snatched looks across the operation table, and a couple of unexpected winks thrown his way in passing, he and TJ had never really interacted before. Cyrus had always tried to keep his distance, afraid of what he might do if he were left alone with the frustratingly charming paediatrician for too long. But apparently, he couldn\u2019t avoid the other man forever.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Hello,\u201d Cyrus said as he approached TJ, anxiously wringing his hands together. He could already feel the nervous sweat beading on his skin, and his face was practically starting to smoke as the blush in his cheeks grew darker and darker, almost reaching the tips of his ears by the time TJ finally turned around and acknowledged him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the fellow greeted him, the corner of his mouth twitching with a smirk of recognition. \u201cAre you on my service today?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat. \u201cNot exactly, but\u2026 I-I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019m supposed to be, so Dr. Metcalf told me to go with the first resident I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you picked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I-I mean\u2026 I saw you\u00a0<i>first</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s gaze skipped over him \u2013 from the toes of his tennis shoes, all the way up to the unartfully-tousled mop of hair on top of his head \u2013 and finally settled on the spot between his eyes. After a moment of consideration, he made a humming noise and took a step closer, his flirtatious smile almost brushing against the shell of Cyrus\u2019 ear.</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A bolt of attraction pierced through Cyrus\u2019 chest, taking him by surprise. He tore his eyes away from TJ and coughed into his fist, internally begging the heat in his face to finally subside, before it melted the skin off his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d TJ observed, sounding genuinely concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded a little too enthusiastically. \u201cYes! I\u2019m fine, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve never done, um\u2026 p-paediatrics\u2026 before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, probably wondering if Cyrus had deliberately injected as much implication as possible into that sentence, then gave him a friendly clap on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Yes. Exactly. Um\u2026 Thank you, TJ. I mean\u2026\u00a0<i>Dr. Kippen</i>. Sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d TJ said, his eyes twinkling with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re Cyrus, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to familiarise myself with all the interns. Especially the cute ones.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered a nervous laugh and ducked his head, studiously avoiding TJ\u2019s eyes. He hadn\u2019t expected the fellow to be so forward with his flirting. A couple of winks in the corridor was one thing, but face-to-face compliments? He hadn\u2019t prepared himself for that. How was he supposed to respond?</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d TJ said, as if he could sense the mental breakdown currently taking place inside his mind. \u201cI\u2019m only messing with you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that didn\u2019t make him feel any better. If anything, it made him feel worse.\u00a0<i>Disappointed</i>. Did TJ flirt like this with all the interns? Was Cyrus nothing more than an easily-flustered nerd for him to play games with? Or was he completely overthinking this and acting like an idiot? It was probably the latter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, smiling and exhaling at the same time. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little on edge.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cLittle kids aren\u2019t that scary, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the parents I\u2019m most worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u00a0<i>that\u2019s\u00a0</i>a legitimate fear.\u201d</p><p>The two of them shared a smile, and Cyrus could feel the blush finally draining from his cheeks. When he wasn\u2019t overanalysing every little thing TJ did, the man wasn\u2019t too difficult to get along with. He was actually pretty nice. And\u2026 handsome? There was no point in denying it, especially inside his own head. TJ Kippen was a very handsome man, and Cyrus was at least 60% attracted to him. Maybe even more. Well,\u00a0<i>definitely\u00a0</i>more, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Cyrus had never felt so comfortable about his sexuality \u2013 a thing only he, Buffy, and Andi were aware of \u2013 before. It was refreshing.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get a move on,\u201d TJ said, glancing down at his pager. When he looked back up at Cyrus, his usual smirk had fallen into place again. \u201cThere\u2019s a broken arm with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Yay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the enthusiasm.\u201c TJ gave him a quick wink, then spun on his heels and marched towards the doors. With his considerably long legs, it only took him a few strides to reach the other end of The Pit, leaving Cyrus standing by himself with his mouth hanging open. \u201cFollow me, intern!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus scrambled after him, the tail of his too-long coat slapping against the backs of his thighs as he rushed across the room. For the next few minutes, he followed TJ through the hospital, slipping through dense crowds and dodging incoming trolleys and wheelchairs as TJ seamlessly glided down the corridors. He clearly knew his way around the hospital, and Cyrus didn\u2019t know whether to be impressed or intimidated.</p><p>\u201cYou still with me?\u201d TJ asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Cyrus shouted a breathless \u201cYes\u201d in response, almost running straight into the fellow\u2019s back as he came to a sudden stop.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Cyrus muttered under his breath.</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile. He was standing with his arms folded in an authoritative kind of stance, but Cyrus could see the childlike excitement brimming beneath the surface. He obviously adored his job, and he couldn\u2019t wait to share it with someone. Cyrus was just glad he got to be that lucky someone.</p><p>\u201cThis is this paediatrics ward,\u201d TJ said, tapping a few things on his tablet as he swept Cyrus into a large room covered in stickers, paintings, and colourful posters.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cyrus said, his heart fluttering at TJ\u2019s responding grin.</p><p>\u201cImpressive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the paintings were made by the kids,\u201d TJ explained as he guided Cyrus deeper into the room, taking a left at the end of the beds and down a corridor flanked by private rooms, some of them with crudely decorated nameplates hanging on the doors. \u201cPainting seems to relax them, you know? The parents, too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the back of TJ\u2019s head, privately admiring the obvious affection the fellow had for his patients. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s a few budding artists in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d TJ huffed a laugh. \u201cSome of these kids are scarily talented. All of them, really, in their own little ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really care about them, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ paused, his back still turned to Cyrus. The stiff set of the fellow\u2019s shoulders made him worry he\u2019d said something wrong, but when TJ turned to face him, his eyes were as bright as the radiant smile dimpling his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cWorking here\u2026 I\u2019ve seen some stuff that\u2019s changed me, made me wanna throw in the towel and get out of medicine altogether. It\u2019s not always easy, taking the responsibility of a child\u2019s life into your hands.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face, a shuddering breath passing between his fingers. \u201cBut then I think of all the kids I\u2019ve saved, all the ones that still pay me visits and send me thank you cards, and it makes everything else worth it. The bad times. The\u00a0<i>hard\u00a0</i>times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWorking in paediatrics is the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, his fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and comfort the other man. But then TJ blinked, and the unshed tears in his eyes were replaced by a familiar hint of playful arrogance that made Cyrus\u2019 heart stutter with uncontrollable desire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry for the sob story,\u201d TJ said, flashing him a smile. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t control myself around cute guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered. \u201cWait, what? Are you telling me that was just an elaborate pickup line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was true,\u201d TJ said, his lips twitching as he fought back a smirk. \u201cI really\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0love the kids here, and working in paediatrics really\u00a0<i>is\u00a0</i>the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. But I need to exaggerate it a little bit for the guys, you know? The sad, brooding doctor act\u00a0<i>never\u00a0</i>fails to work wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 kinda messed up.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNah. The kids here are constantly bugging me about my love life. They\u2019re kinda like my mini wingmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d Cyrus said, but his words were light with laughter. There was something quite endearing about the thought of TJ\u2019s patients being so invested in finding him a boyfriend. But he still couldn\u2019t ignore the dull pang of jealousy deep down in his stomach when he pictured TJ recycling the same, meaningless lines on a bunch of other guys who weren\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cYou say sick, I say smart. Agree to disagree?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes and smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said a word. They just stood there in silence, barely inches apart in the near-empty corridor, and smiled at each other. But then a child started crying a few rooms down, effectively ruining the moment, and they both sprung apart, staring down at the floor and rubbing the backs of their necks like a couple of guilty teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, um\u2026. We should probably stop chatting and actually do some work,\u201d TJ said. There was a light dusting of pink on his cheeks, the closest Cyrus had ever seen the fellow to getting flustered, but other than that, he seemed completely unaffected by the unshifting tension in the air. \u201cYou ready to start?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The next few hours passed in a blur of wailing children and anxious parents, all of them with an abundance of questions that Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Luckily, TJ was always by his side, offering his support whenever he noticed Cyrus struggling. When the fellow was totally immersed in his job, and not trying to woo Cyrus with dazzling smiles and wry comments, he was actually a very gentle and patient person, and Cyrus found himself falling deeper and deeper for the other man as the seconds ticked by.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with kids,\u201d he blurted out at one point, after TJ had given a little girl a lollipop in exchange for her sitting still for an injection. When TJ looked at him, clearly taken aback by the unexpected compliment, Cyrus felt his face flush. \u201cI mean\u2026 You definitely made the right career choice.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s surprise softened into fondness, his eyes flicking curiously over Cyrus\u2019 pinkening face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself, you know?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d TJ said, placing a steady hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u00a0<i>More\u00a0</i>than great.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the touch of TJ\u2019s fingertips, Cyrus\u2019 skin sizzled and ached with longing. It seeped into his veins and punctured his heart, oozing a strange combination of fear and excitement that flooded his chest with warmth.</p><p>\u201cThank you, TJ,\u201d he said, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>They were standing so close that TJ could probably feel the heat of Cyrus\u2019 blush in the tight space between them. If it weren\u2019t for the little girl happily sucking on the strawberry lollipop in her bed right next to them, Cyrus might\u2019ve done something stupid, like lean forward and kiss the other man. In fact, he might\u2019ve kissed him anyway \u2013 privacy be damned \u2013 if one the attendings hadn\u2019t suddenly appeared and stolen the fellow away from him.</p><p>While TJ was going over some charts with the attending in the corner of the room, occasionally glancing over the elderly woman\u2019s shoulder and meeting his eyes with a secret smile, Cyrus busied himself by smoothing the sheets at the end of the little girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your lollipop?\u201d he asked her, trying his best to ignore the heat of TJ\u2019s distant gaze.</p><p>The girl swung her head up and down. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re braver than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be terrified of needles when I was your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cYeah, well\u2026 I\u2019m a doctor in training. But the needles still freak me out a little bit.\u201d He glanced around the room, pretending to make sure no one could hear them, then leaned across the bed and pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s our little secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>The girl giggled and nodded, using her lollipop to draw an invisible cross over her heart. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a star.\u201d Cyrus lifted his hand, and the girl slapped a high-five onto his palm. \u201cMaybe you can teach me how to be as brave as\u00a0<i>you\u00a0</i>are someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>When he turned away from the bed, Cyrus was surprised to find TJ watching him from across the room, his eyes lidded softly. Despite the attending still yapping in his ear, TJ\u2019s attention was fixed solely on him, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t seem to wrangle himself free from the fellow\u2019s unwavering gaze. Probably because he didn\u2019t want to. It felt nice to have someone look at him like that, even if it was just a well-rehearsed act for flirting with random men.</p><p><i>It doesn\u2019t feel like an act</i>, a voice whispered in his heart.</p><p>Cyrus sucked in a deep breath, still staring intensely at TJ, then allowed himself to smile. It felt dangerous, succumbing to this, but he didn\u2019t care. Especially when TJ returned his smile with a boyish grin that made his eyes dance like scattered sunlight cascading through the trees.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening?\u201d he heard the attending say.</p><p>TJ tore his eyes away from Cyrus and cleared his throat. \u201cSorry, yes. Go on\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>As the attending continued to ramble, TJ flicked one last smirk across the room, and Cyrus felt his heart soar. It was like being back in High School, passing suggestive notes under the desk and grinning like an idiot every time your hands brushed.</p><p>\u201cI think Dr. Kippen likes you,\u201d the little girl said, leaning across the bed to poke Cyrus in the arm. Her strawberry-tinted lips were stretched into an impish smile. \u201cDo you like him back?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed furiously. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix and three quarters,\u201d the girl said, sitting up straight to make herself seem bigger.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cyrus reached forward and ruffled her hair. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re\u00a0<i>quite\u00a0</i>old enough to understand \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks at you the way my daddy looks at my mommy,\u201d the girl interjected, jutting out her chin defiantly. \u201cHe never looks at other boys like that. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his stomach drop. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d The girl ripped the lollipop out of her mouth and waved it impatiently in the air. \u201cDo you like him or not?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus risked a glance across the room. Even from this distance, he could still appreciate the fellow\u2019s profile \u2013 the long slope of his nose; the sandy swoop of his hair; the delicate curve of his smile\u2026 There was no denying how handsome TJ was, just as there was no denying his ever-deepening feelings for the other man.</p><p>\u201cYes, I like him,\u201d Cyrus admitted with a sigh of defeat. \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>By the time Cyrus dragged himself into the interns\u2019 locker room at the end of his shift, it was verging on ten o\u2019clock, the crisp morning light he\u2019d last seen filtering through the boxy window at the back of the room now reduced to a deep, almost inky black. It was a few weeks shy of winter, and the nights were now long, dark, and cold. He was almost tempted to return to the paediatrics ward, where the corridors were bright and warm, and TJ\u2019s dazzling smile was there to keep him company. But after sixteen hours of stitching gashes, poking needles, and splinting broken bones \u2013 all the while trying not to spontaneously combust every time TJ so much as looked at him \u2013 all he really wanted to do was go home and get some rest.</p><p>He was pulling a dark green sweater over his head when someone else came through the door, silencing the idle chatter of the interns dotted around the room. Confused, Cyrus wriggled his head into the light and peered around the lockers, barely containing a gasp when he saw TJ standing in the doorway. The moment their eyes met, the fellow turned to the other interns and swapped his easy smile for an intimidating glare.</p><p>\u201cClear the room,\u201d he said, the commanding tone of his voice leaving no room for argument. \u201cI need to have a word with Goodman.\u201d</p><p>It only took a handful of seconds for the interns to follow orders, all of them practically tripping over each other in their haste to get out of the room. When the last of them had disappeared, leaving him and TJ alone, the fellow closed the door and joined Cyrus by the lockers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2026 I wanted to talk to you before you left.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tugged nervously at the hem of his sweater. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you how great you were today,\u201d TJ said, stammering slightly as a light blush crept up his neck and blotted his jawline. It was strangely comforting to see a hint of nerves amongst his seemingly limitless supply of confidence; it made him seem more human, and therefore more obtainable. \u201cYou should be really proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Cyrus said, nibbling at the shy smile slowly blooming across his face. A beat of silence passed, and he took a step closer to TJ, daring a glance at the other man\u2019s face \u2013 so close, it was almost blurred. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came here,\u201d he added, his voice breathy. \u201cI wanted to thank you, for being such a good teacher.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s my\u00a0<i>job</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take the compliment,\u201d Cyrus said, rolling his eyes with a teasing smile. \u201cYou were great, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, TJ\u2019s face fell slack, and Cyrus was worried he\u2019d overstepped somehow. But then the fellow swallowed thickly, his throat rippling, and reached out to touch Cyrus\u2019 arm, tugging him forward slowly, cautiously, giving him the option to resist if he wanted to\u2026 But saying no to this was the\u00a0<i>last\u00a0</i>thing he wanted, so he stayed where he was, eyes falling closed and lips parting slightly, waiting for the warm pressure of TJ\u2019s mouth against his own. And when it finally arrived, the breath hitching in his throat and stars swimming behind his eyelids, it was everything he\u2019d hoped for and more.\u00a0<i>So much more</i>.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he mumbled as they pulled apart, his hands fisting in the lapels of TJ\u2019s coat. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnexpected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed, breathless and giddy. \u201cBut, also no.\u201d</p><p>TJ lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have been flirting with me or a while now. I mean, you\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to respond to subtlety,\u201d TJ said, smirking slightly as his fingers brushed the back of Cyrus\u2019 neck, \u201cso I had to kick it up a notch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He placed a hand on TJ\u2019s chest and chuckled, already leaning in for another kiss. \u201cYou really\u00a0<i>are\u00a0</i>a good teacher\u2026\u201d</p><p>Before their lips could connect for a second time, TJ pulled away, the warmth of his fingers slipping from Cyrus\u2019 neck. \u201cAre we still talking about paediatrics?\u201d he asked, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus said, winking clumsily. \u201cAmongst other things.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in once again, but TJ rebuffed him, his lips thinning into a grimace as he loosened Cyrus\u2019 grip on his coat. \u201cHang on,\u201d he said, keeping Cyrus an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cWas\u2026 Was that your first kiss with a guy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus winced. \u201cIs that problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You said you wanted to teach me,\u201d Cyrus said. He heard the desperation in his own voice and cringed, a distant echo of shame pounding in his ears. He clenched his fists and tried again. \u201cYou said you would teach me, and I\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d TJ closed his eyes and inhaled through his noise, like he was trying to keep his temper in check. When he opened them again, Cyrus saw the pity staring back at him and shrank away, embarrassed and ashamed and\u00a0<i>confused</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, Cyrus. And I like you. I really do, but\u2026 I\u2019ve done my coming out already. I can\u2019t go through that again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new to this. I get that. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to figure yourself out and everything. But I don\u2019t wanna be a part of it.\u201d He shook his head and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t teach you how to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help with paediatrics? I\u2019m there. But not with this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hunched his shoulders, a flash of anger slicing through the muddle of emotions storming inside his chest. \u201cSo, what? I\u2019m not\u00a0<i>experienced\u00a0</i>enough for you? Is that it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d TJ exclaimed, tearing a hand through his hair. The violent swipe of his fingers ruffled the gel-stiffened waves, fluffing them out and sending locks of hair flopping over his forehead. He looked much better like that, despite everything. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna help you out of the closet, okay? That\u2019s something you\u2019ve gotta do by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d TJ said grimly. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve spent years learning to accept yourself, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d Cyrus said, sniffing back tears.</p><p>TJ cocked his head in agreement. \u201cFair enough. But that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d He flitted his eyes over Cyrus\u2019 face once more, his breath catching in hesitation, then finally turned around. With his hand on the door, he flicked a parting glance over his shoulder and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, he was gone.</p><p>~~ ~~~</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass,\u201d Buffy said, crushing an empty can of soda in her fist with one squeeze. Outside, the rain was screaming and whirling like an angry spirit, and the three of them were waiting it out in the cafeteria. \u201cDo you want me to talk to him? Beat him up for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cThanks, Buffy\u2026 But, no. I just wanna forget about him altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem really upset,\u201d Andi said softly.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really liked him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged in frustration. Not at Andi, but at himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let myself fall for someone like TJ Kippen. I mean, he probably flirts with anything that moves! I should\u2019ve known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Buffy assured him. \u201cHe led you on, Cyrus. We all saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI thought he actually liked me. It\u00a0<i>felt\u00a0</i>like he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe manipulated you.\u201d</p><p>Andi frowned. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Buffy said, her eyebrows lifting incredulously. \u201cHe\u2019s been flirting with Cyrus for weeks, and the moment he had him where he wanted him, he changed his mind. It was all just a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to come out,\u201d Andi shot back, making Buffy flinch in surprise. \u201cWhen Amber asked me out, I was a mess. I\u2019d never been with another girl before. And if it hadn\u2019t been for her patience and understanding \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2013 we probably wouldn\u2019t be together right now. But it isn\u2019t so easy for everyone.\u201d She turned away from Buffy and took Cyrus\u2019 hand, sweeping a comforting thumb over his knuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how difficult it was for TJ to come out. It might not be something he wants to revisit, and you asking him to walk you through the basics of being gay isn\u2019t gonna help that.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus balked. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I wanted! I just\u2026 I wanted to learn from him because I\u00a0<i>like\u00a0</i>him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Andi said. \u201cYou wanted him to teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest with yourself, Cy. Try and see things from TJ\u2019s point of view.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought back to their conversation in the locker room, how quickly TJ\u2019s softness had hardened into rejection the moment he\u2019d realised how inexperienced Cyrus was, the distance in his eyes when he\u2019d turned him down\u2026 He didn\u2019t want to be Cyrus\u2019 teacher. That much was obvious. But what if the rest of it had been real? What if Cyrus really\u00a0<i>was\u00a0</i>the one in the wrong here?</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he whispered to himself, the blood draining from his face as realisation dawned on him. \u201cHe thought I was using him.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled knowingly. \u201cAnd you thought\u00a0<i>he\u00a0</i>was using\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a second,\u201d Buffy interrupted, wagging a finger in the air as she struggled to catch up. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus thought TJ rejected him because he was inexperienced,\u201d Andi explained in a slow, patronising tone of voice. She was clearly enjoying being ahead of Buffy for once. \u201cBut TJ actually rejected him because he thought Cyrus was using him to\u00a0<i>gain\u00a0</i>experience. Do you get it now?\u201d</p><p>Buffy folded her arms and grumbled. \u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d Cyrus said, his mind still buzzing with a thousand fleeting thoughts, \u201che didn\u2019t need to turn me down so abruptly. I mean, he didn\u2019t even let me explain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d Andi squeezed his hand and smiled. \u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you? You said it yourself. And he likes you. I\u00a0<i>know\u00a0</i>he does. So why are you trying so hard to talk yourself out of this?\u201d She scooted closer across the bench and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t let a stupid misunderstanding ruin this for you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, a trembling bundle in his lap, and exhaled a shaky breath. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d he asked, the roaring of the rain outside almost swallowing his words. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me because he thinks I\u2019m na\u00efve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u00a0<i>would\u00a0</i>be an ass,\u201d Andi said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Buffy groaned. \u201cI hate to admit, but I think she\u2019s right\u2026 I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. There\u2019s no faking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a guy before,\u201d Cyrus whimpered, stating what they both already knew. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m bad at it? What if I\u00a0<i>do\u00a0</i>need someone to teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay,\u201d Buffy said simply. \u201cYou don\u2019t need someone to teach you what you already know.\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could protest any further, one of the doors leading outside opened with a heavy\u00a0<i>thump</i>, and TJ came stumbling into the cafeteria, thoroughly soaked to the bone. There was water streaming down his face, a sheet of dark blond hair covering his eyes, and his scrubs were completely sodden. Cyrus could do nothing but watch in stunned silence as the fellow shook himself out like a large dog and blindly collapsed into a nearby chair. It was only when he swept the hair out of his eyes that he noticed Cyrus watching him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI, um\u2026 I\u2019ll go somewhere else \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d Buffy asked him, her expression flitting between amused and repulsed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s pouring it down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very smart for a fellow, are you?\u201d</p><p>TJ gave her a tight, acidic smile. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t been here long, intern, but not every ward in this hospital is conveniently connected by corridors.\u201d</p><p>Buffy simply glowered in response.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, guys,\u201d Andi said, smiling nervously as she attempted to smooth things over. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults, aren\u2019t we? I\u2019m sure we can sit here without arguing until the rain stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d TJ scraped back his chair and got to his feet, the soles of his shoes squeaking against the wet floor. For a brief moment, his eyes landed on Cyrus, but they quickly danced away and returned to the rain lashing against the windows instead. \u201cWish me luck, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was standing before he\u2019d even decided to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, the rain \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little water\u2019s not gonna hurt me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut losing TJ will.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gagged. \u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re in love and everything, but there was no need for that level of cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Andi said, beaming as she reached out and squeezed Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cGo get him, Cy!\u201d</p><p>As soon as he opened the door, the rain hit him like a thousand flecks of ice, instantly raising the hair on his arms and turning his cheeks a deep, stinging shade of pink. But there was no going back now. He could see TJ\u2019s retreating form just ahead, quickly fading in the grey smudge of rain sweeping across his vision. If he didn\u2019t move now, he would lose him, and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able find the courage to confront him like this again.</p><p>So he ran.</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d The wind picked up his words and tossed them into the sky, becoming one with the rain and sinking into the wet earth beneath his feet. \u201cTJ, wait!\u201d</p><p>With his nose buried in the crook of his arm to shield his face from the storm, he chased after the distant speck of white with all the energy he could muster. By the time his hand latched onto the soggy tail of TJ\u2019s coat, his legs were burning, despite the rain leeching through his scrubs, and he could barely breathe enough air into his lungs to spit out a single word. But, luckily, TJ didn\u2019t shove him away like he\u2019d expected him to. He stood there, quiet and grim, as Cyrus caught his breath, seemingly indifferent to the darkening clouds above their heads, and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I need\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re only making this harder, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand?\u201d he asked, spraying Cyrus with droplets of rain as he whipped around to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re new to the whole coming out thing. You wanna have some fun, figure yourself out\u2026 I get it. But I\u2019m not interested in playing a one-time part in your journey to self-discovery. I want something that\u2019s gonna last, okay? A relationship that\u00a0<i>means\u00a0</i>something, for once. And you\u2019re obviously not looking for that kind of thing, so \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m looking for!\u201d Cyrus yelled. \u201cJust because I\u2019m inexperienced, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignorant. I\u2019ve known what I want for a very long time. And for some bizarre reason,\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0happen to be it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with one of my best friends when I was thirteen. I\u2019ve known I was gay for almost half my life. So don\u2019t you\u00a0<i>dare\u00a0</i>stand there and accuse me of not understanding the struggles of learning to accept yourself, because\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve\u00a0</i>lived it too! And just because I\u2019ve never been with another guy before, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not sure of who I am, or what I want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you don\u2019t want the responsibility of being my first boyfriend. Maybe you\u2019re scared it will be awkward and difficult and too much work.\u00a0<i>I understand that</i>. But that doesn\u2019t give you the right to jump to conclusions and ignore me!\u201d</p><p>At this point, TJ was smirking, and Cyrus could feel his anger rising and rising, like a pot of water close to boiling over.</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d the fellow asked, taking a step towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus shoved him away and growled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not done yet! Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done to me? I\u2019ve spent nearly thirteen years hiding from who I really am,\u00a0<i>terrified\u00a0</i>of getting hurt all over again. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long that I forgot what it felt like to be\u00a0<i>me</i>.\u201d He shook his head, half-choking on a sob. \u201cAnd then you kissed me, and I felt like I\u00a0<i>existed\u00a0</i>again.\u201d</p><p>TJ stopped smirking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this means to you. I don\u2019t know if you like flirting with me, and that\u2019s it, or if you actually wanna be with me. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I was a goner the moment you winked at me.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. It felt good to be honest. It felt like the rain - \u00a0crazy and reckless and\u00a0<i>real</i>. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m inexperienced. And awkward. And I tend to say the wrong things at the wrong times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m also nice. And loyal. And my friends think I\u2019m a catch. So if you still wanna turn me down, that\u2019s fine. But if you decide to give this a chance, you won\u2019t regret it, because \u2013\u201d</p><p>The rest of his words were swallowed by a kiss.</p><p>Cyrus made a little squawk of surprise as TJ\u2019s lips melted against his own, all of his pent up frustration seeping out of him within seconds, leaving him weightless and airy, elastic and free\u2026 He clutched onto TJ\u2019s shoulders and whimpered slightly, losing himself to the melodic\u00a0<i>whoosh\u00a0</i>of the rain as TJ pulled him impossibly closer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked me,\u201d he mumbled between kisses, gently tucking the hair behind Cyrus\u2019 ears. \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He cupped TJ\u2019s face and pressed their foreheads together, breathing him in. \u201cYou have nothing to apologise for. I\u2019m the idiot who made you think you were nothing more than a\u00a0<i>practice\u00a0</i>boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus froze, his face flushing darkly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me you didn\u2019t mean to call me your boyfriend, I\u2019m gonna be really upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2026 You\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>me to call you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, revealing the wicked slice of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019ve been flirting with you for a while now. And\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>is what usually comes after the flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u00a0<i>is</i>\u00a0this exactly?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, the confidence\u00a0in his smile not quite reaching his eyes. \u201cMe asking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>. Unless you don\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just chased you through a storm in nothing but scrubs and poured out my heart to you like we\u2019re in a Hallmark movie, and you honestly don\u2019t think I wanna be your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d he laughed, palming the back of TJ\u2019s neck and kissing him softly. All around them, the sky shivered and wept, bathing them in tears of joy as they clung onto each other for dear life,\u00a0laughing and hugging and basking in the rain.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus tugged the fleece blanket over his shoulders and tucked it under his chin, shuddering with relief as the heat pulsing from the radiator slowly filled the on-call room. He could still feel the occasional drop of rain rolling down his spine, but at least he could also feel his toes again. And the hot cocoa TJ had placed in his hands a few minutes ago was quickly thawing his icy palms as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d his said, lips trembling as he took a tentative sip from the steaming cup. The burn was delicious.</p><p>TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer, until he was practically sitting on his lap. Despite being equally soaked, TJ seemed to radiate warmth at all times, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t resist snuggling against his boyfriend\u2019s \u2013 yes,\u00a0<i>boyfriend\u2019s\u00a0</i>\u2013 chest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou smell like rain,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s quite nice, actually.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, ear pressed against the steady beating of TJ\u2019s heart. The sudden shift from freezing to cosy was taking its toll, making him feel sluggish and loose-lipped. He had no idea what he was going to say until the words tumbled out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you only kiss me to shut me up?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cHow could I\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0kiss you when you were being so damn cute?\u201d He threaded his fingers through Cyrus\u2019 hair, gently undoing all the frazzled knots left behind by the rain. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry for interrupting your Hallmark speech. What else were you gonna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was more or less done,\u201d Cyrus admitted. \u201cI was just gonna reassure you that you wouldn\u2019t have to go through the drama of coming out all over again.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, shifting on the bed so Cyrus was laying across his legs, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said the other day,\u201d he said quietly, his fingers resuming their careful exploration of Cyrus\u2019 hair. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be involved in another shame spiral, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not spiralling,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m definitely not ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He reached up and touched TJ\u2019s face, tracing the fine bones beneath his lightly-stubbled cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a sap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m just getting started\u2026\u201d</p><p>When their lips were mere inches apart, TJ\u2019s pager started buzzing at his hip, and Cyrus was caught between laughter and tears as he moved off the fellow\u2019s lap so he could check it. All he wanted to do was stay in this tiny room, with the lights low and the rain pattering against the window, and kiss his boyfriend. But when there were little kids with scraped knees and poorly tummies waiting for his assistance,\u00a0Cyrus didn\u2019t mind letting him go. This was the life they\u2019d both chosen for themselves, after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ huffed, already half-standing. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a sleepy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stay here and rest for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, TJ was gently prying the half-empty cup from his hands and lowering his head onto a pillow. Cyrus could hear the smile in his voice as he leaned over and kissed the sensitive spot behind his ear, whispering goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come find you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s being a sap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d TJ said simply, planting one last kiss on Cyrus\u2019 forehead as he got to his feet. \u00a0</p><p>Before he could leave, Cyrus grabbed onto his elbow and ushered him closer. TJ obliged with a fond little smile, crouching down beside the bed, and allowed Cyrus to kiss him on the lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too,\u201d Cyrus murmured softly, bumping their noses together.</p><p>After a few more parting kisses (with Cyrus promising each one would be the last) TJ managed to escape the on-call room, pausing briefly in the doorway to wave Cyrus goodbye and mockingly blow him a kiss. Joke or not, Cyrus still pretended to catch it mid-air and press it against his mouth, to which TJ blushed like a schoolboy and walked backwards into the wall, before stammering a final goodbye and disappearing down the corridor. Cyrus stared at the spot where the fellow had once stood until his eyelids began to droop closed. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d barely been asleep for five minutes when the door slammed open again, no doubt leaving a mark where it collided with the wall. His eyes sprang open as he sat bolt upright, only to find Buffy and Andi standing in the middle of the room, pointing at him accusingly with their mouths gaping open.</p><p>\u201cYou both look ridiculous,\u201d he said, collapsing back against his pillow.</p><p>\u201cWe saw you kissing TJ in the rain!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>Andi nodded in agreement. \u201cYes! We saw you through the window!\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u00a0</i>\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 We kissed. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr should we say, where\u2019s your\u00a0<i>boyfriend</i>?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cWell, considering TJ and I are dating now, I guess you\u00a0<i>should\u00a0</i>say that.\u201d</p><p>All at once, Buffy and Andi were crowded around him, jumping on the bed and shaking his arms as they bombarded him with a thousand overlapping questions. He didn\u2019t say a word, just sat there and soaked in the attention with a smug little smile, his thoughts slipping back to TJ. The dirty-blond in the dark blue scrubs. The paediatrics fellow.\u00a0<i>His boyfriend</i>.</p><p>And for the first time in almost thirteen years, he actually felt like himself again.</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p><i>Thank you again for your patience, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6bUlRhshKvuSxiEWBPW-yw\">@tyrusflavoredtea</a>.

You don\u2019t need to watch Grey\u2019s Anatomy to read this fic.\u00a0</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p>It was barely six in the morning when Cyrus shuffled into The Pit, one hand wrapped around a\u00a0paper cup of coffee while the other sluggishly patted his pillow-mussed hair into shape. The sun was still making its slow ascent into the sky, spilling its morning glow across the ambulance bay outside, but Shadyside Hospital was already alive with people \u2013 patients and practitioners alike. As always, the air was buzzing with a frantic, suspenseful energy, but Cyrus had a feeling that today\u2019s shift was going to be even crazier than usual.</p><p>As soon as he spotted Andi and Buffy standing next to a row of gurneys\u00a0on the side of the room, Cyrus downed the last of his coffee, dumped his cup in the nearest bin, and dragged himself across The Pit to join them. His presence was met with a couple of weary nods.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Cy,\u201d Andi greeted him, blinking her tired eyes open as she attempted a small smile. \u201cSleep well?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus groaned. \u201cToo well\u2026 I didn\u2019t wanna leave my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are depressing,\u201d Buffy said with the quirk of an eyebrow. Despite the dark smudges beneath her eyes, she seemed relatively well-rested, and Cyrus envied her for it. \u201cWhose service are you on today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d Cyrus said. He stifled a yawn with the back of his hand and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be stuck in the clinic again, knowing my luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clinic isn\u2019t\u00a0<i>that\u00a0</i>bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grunt work, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Buffy opened her mouth to protest, then changed her mind, probably deciding it was too early in the morning for a debate. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. It isn\u2019t great in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never worked a\u00a0<i>day</i>\u00a0in the clinic,\u201d Andi said, shooting Buffy a teasing glare. \u201cThe residents probably fight over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault everyone wants me on their service.\u201d Buffy cracked her knuckles and grinned, playfully rolling her eyes at Andi\u2019s unimpressed expression. \u201cOh, don\u2019t look at me like that\u2026 You\u2019re the one\u00a0<i>dating\u00a0</i>a resident.\u201d</p><p>Andi folded her arms defensively. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked Amber to do me any favours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you have. But if anyone\u2019s got an advantage here, it\u2019s definitely you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop bickering,\u201d Cyrus pleaded, gingerly rubbing his temples to ease the pounding in his head. The bright lights of The Pit never failed to give him a headache, especially when he was still in the process of waking up. \u201cI would give anything to be put on radiology today,\u201d he continued groggily. \u201cSomewhere dark and quiet, where I could nap in peace\u2026\u201d</p><p>Buffy punched him in the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a surgical intern,\u201d she said, as if he needed reminding. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to\u00a0<i>nap</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Sleep is a thing of the past for people like us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it!\u201d he exclaimed, flapping his arms like a bird caught in a net. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0<i>tired</i>. And when I\u2019m tired, I get cranky. And when I\u2019m cranky, I get dramatic. It\u2019s a vicious circle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you better reel it in,\u201d Buffy said, dropping her voice to an urgent whisper. \u201cDr. Metcalf\u2019s coming over.\u201d</p><p>Within seconds, the Chief of Surgery was looming over them, wearing his signature frown as he carefully surveyed the interns with a pair of sharp, judgemental eyes. After a few moments of tense silence, the older man wrinkled his nose and leaned back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you three have someplace to be?\u201d he asked, phrasing the question like a warning.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Metcalf,\u201d Andi and Buffy squeaked in unison, their eyes as wide as dinner plates. When Cyrus didn\u2019t say a word, they both turned to him with questioning looks of horror.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually know whose service I\u2019m on today,\u201d he hurried to explain, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p>Dr. Metcalf sighed. \u201cThe incompetency of you interns is astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise. Just get to work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with the first resident you see for today. But don\u2019t let this kind of amateur mistake happen again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Dr. Metcalf walked away, Cyrus allowed himself to breathe again, his wobbly legs giving way as he slumped against Buffy\u2019s side for support.</p><p>\u201cI think I just peed myself.\u201d</p><p>Andi snorted. \u201cAre you okay, Cy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just traumatised. Nothing major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go again with the dramatics,\u201d Buffy said, shoving him off with a shrug. As she was pressing the crinkles out of her scrubs, her eyes landed on something across the room, and a devious smirk appeared on her lips. \u201cWell, I guess that answers the question of whose service you\u2019re on today.\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could ask any questions, Buffy grabbed his chin and turned his head to the right, pointing his gaze towards a dirty-blond man in dark blue scrubs standing at the opposite end of The Pit, his green eyes scrolling up and down the tablet in his hands.</p><p><i>TJ Kippen</i>. Or, as Buffy and Andi liked to call him,\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u2019 big fat crush</i>.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Cyrus said, shaking his head as he took a step backwards, accidentally stumbling into a (thankfully) empty bed. \u201cI can\u2019t work with that guy\u2026 No way!\u201d</p><p>Andi sidled up to Buffy with a matching smirk. \u201cDr. Metcalf\u00a0<i>did\u00a0</i>tell you to go with the first resident you see. You don\u2019t want to disobey the Chief of Surgery, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s a\u00a0<i>fellow</i>\u00a0\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2013 and I can just pretend I never saw him,\u201d Cyrus said, frantically scanning The Pit for any signs of another resident. The room was swarming with pale blue scrubs and white coats, but TJ Kippen was the only spot of darkness in sight. It was hopeless. \u201cI can\u2019t spend the entire day one-to-one with him,\u201d Cyrus insisted. \u201cWhat if he \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinks at you again?\u201d Buffy suggested, biting back a grin as Andi smothered her giggles with the sleeve of her coat. \u201cOh, the horror!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only flirting with you,\u201d Andi said, taking a deep breath to compose herself. \u201cMaybe he likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a guy!\u201d Cyrus hissed, instant heat rushing to his cheeks as a couple of heads turned their way. As soon as the attention had shifted away from them, he lowered his voice and continued, \u201cA guy\u2019s never flirted with me before. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him down gently.\u201d Andi flicked a glance at Buffy, her eyebrows raised in a silent question, then turned back to Cyrus with a shrug. \u201cUnless you don\u2019t want to, of course.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blanched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026 You do talk about him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Buffy said, scraping her hair into a bun on top of her head. The pager at her hip started buzzing as soon as she dropped her arms, and she answered it without hesitation. \u201cWell, I wish I could stay here and talk some sense into you all morning, but some of us have work to do.\u201d And with that, she pinched his cheek and made her way towards the double doors leading to the rest of the hospital, turning at the last second to give him a thumbs up. \u201cJust go with your gut,\u201d she shouted across The Pit. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, when the bustling crowds slowly started to thin out, Andi bit her lip and sighed. \u201cI better get going too,\u201d she said, offering Cyrus a sympathetic smile as he desperately clung to her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Cy. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gulped. \u201cBut\u2026 What if I don\u2019t\u00a0<i>know</i>\u00a0what I want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now\u2019s your chance to figure it out.\u201d She patted his hand and kissed his cheek, giving him a moment to gather his nerves, then pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, a sickly pallor washing his cheeks as he forced himself to nod. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>With Andi and Buffy both gone, and the rest of the interns slowly trickling out of The Pit, Cyrus had no choice but to force his jellified legs across the room and formally introduce himself. Besides a few snatched looks across the operation table, and a couple of unexpected winks thrown his way in passing, he and TJ had never really interacted before. Cyrus had always tried to keep his distance, afraid of what he might do if he were left alone with the frustratingly charming paediatrician for too long. But apparently, he couldn\u2019t avoid the other man forever.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Hello,\u201d Cyrus said as he approached TJ, anxiously wringing his hands together. He could already feel the nervous sweat beading on his skin, and his face was practically starting to smoke as the blush in his cheeks grew darker and darker, almost reaching the tips of his ears by the time TJ finally turned around and acknowledged him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the fellow greeted him, the corner of his mouth twitching with a smirk of recognition. \u201cAre you on my service today?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat. \u201cNot exactly, but\u2026 I-I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019m supposed to be, so Dr. Metcalf told me to go with the first resident I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you picked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I-I mean\u2026 I saw you\u00a0<i>first</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s gaze skipped over him \u2013 from the toes of his tennis shoes, all the way up to the unartfully-tousled mop of hair on top of his head \u2013 and finally settled on the spot between his eyes. After a moment of consideration, he made a humming noise and took a step closer, his flirtatious smile almost brushing against the shell of Cyrus\u2019 ear.</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>A bolt of attraction pierced through Cyrus\u2019 chest, taking him by surprise. He tore his eyes away from TJ and coughed into his fist, internally begging the heat in his face to finally subside, before it melted the skin off his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cYou look nervous,\u201d TJ observed, sounding genuinely concerned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus nodded a little too enthusiastically. \u201cYes! I\u2019m fine, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve never done, um\u2026 p-paediatrics\u2026 before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, probably wondering if Cyrus had deliberately injected as much implication as possible into that sentence, then gave him a friendly clap on the back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! Yes. Exactly. Um\u2026 Thank you, TJ. I mean\u2026\u00a0<i>Dr. Kippen</i>. Sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d TJ said, his eyes twinkling with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re Cyrus, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to familiarise myself with all the interns. Especially the cute ones.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered a nervous laugh and ducked his head, studiously avoiding TJ\u2019s eyes. He hadn\u2019t expected the fellow to be so forward with his flirting. A couple of winks in the corridor was one thing, but face-to-face compliments? He hadn\u2019t prepared himself for that. How was he supposed to respond?</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d TJ said, as if he could sense the mental breakdown currently taking place inside his mind. \u201cI\u2019m only messing with you.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that didn\u2019t make him feel any better. If anything, it made him feel worse.\u00a0<i>Disappointed</i>. Did TJ flirt like this with all the interns? Was Cyrus nothing more than an easily-flustered nerd for him to play games with? Or was he completely overthinking this and acting like an idiot? It was probably the latter.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, smiling and exhaling at the same time. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a little on edge.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cLittle kids aren\u2019t that scary, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the parents I\u2019m most worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u00a0<i>that\u2019s\u00a0</i>a legitimate fear.\u201d</p><p>The two of them shared a smile, and Cyrus could feel the blush finally draining from his cheeks. When he wasn\u2019t overanalysing every little thing TJ did, the man wasn\u2019t too difficult to get along with. He was actually pretty nice. And\u2026 handsome? There was no point in denying it, especially inside his own head. TJ Kippen was a very handsome man, and Cyrus was at least 60% attracted to him. Maybe even more. Well,\u00a0<i>definitely\u00a0</i>more, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Cyrus had never felt so comfortable about his sexuality \u2013 a thing only he, Buffy, and Andi were aware of \u2013 before. It was refreshing.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get a move on,\u201d TJ said, glancing down at his pager. When he looked back up at Cyrus, his usual smirk had fallen into place again. \u201cThere\u2019s a broken arm with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2026 Yay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the enthusiasm.\u201c TJ gave him a quick wink, then spun on his heels and marched towards the doors. With his considerably long legs, it only took him a few strides to reach the other end of The Pit, leaving Cyrus standing by himself with his mouth hanging open. \u201cFollow me, intern!\u201d</p><p>Cyrus scrambled after him, the tail of his too-long coat slapping against the backs of his thighs as he rushed across the room. For the next few minutes, he followed TJ through the hospital, slipping through dense crowds and dodging incoming trolleys and wheelchairs as TJ seamlessly glided down the corridors. He clearly knew his way around the hospital, and Cyrus didn\u2019t know whether to be impressed or intimidated.</p><p>\u201cYou still with me?\u201d TJ asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Cyrus shouted a breathless \u201cYes\u201d in response, almost running straight into the fellow\u2019s back as he came to a sudden stop.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Cyrus muttered under his breath.</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile. He was standing with his arms folded in an authoritative kind of stance, but Cyrus could see the childlike excitement brimming beneath the surface. He obviously adored his job, and he couldn\u2019t wait to share it with someone. Cyrus was just glad he got to be that lucky someone.</p><p>\u201cThis is this paediatrics ward,\u201d TJ said, tapping a few things on his tablet as he swept Cyrus into a large room covered in stickers, paintings, and colourful posters.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cyrus said, his heart fluttering at TJ\u2019s responding grin.</p><p>\u201cImpressive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the paintings were made by the kids,\u201d TJ explained as he guided Cyrus deeper into the room, taking a left at the end of the beds and down a corridor flanked by private rooms, some of them with crudely decorated nameplates hanging on the doors. \u201cPainting seems to relax them, you know? The parents, too.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the back of TJ\u2019s head, privately admiring the obvious affection the fellow had for his patients. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s a few budding artists in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d TJ huffed a laugh. \u201cSome of these kids are scarily talented. All of them, really, in their own little ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really care about them, huh?\u201d</p><p>TJ paused, his back still turned to Cyrus. The stiff set of the fellow\u2019s shoulders made him worry he\u2019d said something wrong, but when TJ turned to face him, his eyes were as bright as the radiant smile dimpling his cheeks.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cWorking here\u2026 I\u2019ve seen some stuff that\u2019s changed me, made me wanna throw in the towel and get out of medicine altogether. It\u2019s not always easy, taking the responsibility of a child\u2019s life into your hands.\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face, a shuddering breath passing between his fingers. \u201cBut then I think of all the kids I\u2019ve saved, all the ones that still pay me visits and send me thank you cards, and it makes everything else worth it. The bad times. The\u00a0<i>hard\u00a0</i>times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWorking in paediatrics is the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, his fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and comfort the other man. But then TJ blinked, and the unshed tears in his eyes were replaced by a familiar hint of playful arrogance that made Cyrus\u2019 heart stutter with uncontrollable desire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSorry for the sob story,\u201d TJ said, flashing him a smile. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t control myself around cute guys.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus spluttered. \u201cWait, what? Are you telling me that was just an elaborate pickup line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was true,\u201d TJ said, his lips twitching as he fought back a smirk. \u201cI really\u00a0<i>do</i>\u00a0love the kids here, and working in paediatrics really\u00a0<i>is\u00a0</i>the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. But I need to exaggerate it a little bit for the guys, you know? The sad, brooding doctor act\u00a0<i>never\u00a0</i>fails to work wonders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 kinda messed up.\u201d</p><p>TJ shook his head. \u201cNah. The kids here are constantly bugging me about my love life. They\u2019re kinda like my mini wingmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d Cyrus said, but his words were light with laughter. There was something quite endearing about the thought of TJ\u2019s patients being so invested in finding him a boyfriend. But he still couldn\u2019t ignore the dull pang of jealousy deep down in his stomach when he pictured TJ recycling the same, meaningless lines on a bunch of other guys who weren\u2019t him.</p><p>\u201cYou say sick, I say smart. Agree to disagree?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes and smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said a word. They just stood there in silence, barely inches apart in the near-empty corridor, and smiled at each other. But then a child started crying a few rooms down, effectively ruining the moment, and they both sprung apart, staring down at the floor and rubbing the backs of their necks like a couple of guilty teenagers.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, um\u2026. We should probably stop chatting and actually do some work,\u201d TJ said. There was a light dusting of pink on his cheeks, the closest Cyrus had ever seen the fellow to getting flustered, but other than that, he seemed completely unaffected by the unshifting tension in the air. \u201cYou ready to start?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The next few hours passed in a blur of wailing children and anxious parents, all of them with an abundance of questions that Cyrus wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Luckily, TJ was always by his side, offering his support whenever he noticed Cyrus struggling. When the fellow was totally immersed in his job, and not trying to woo Cyrus with dazzling smiles and wry comments, he was actually a very gentle and patient person, and Cyrus found himself falling deeper and deeper for the other man as the seconds ticked by.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with kids,\u201d he blurted out at one point, after TJ had given a little girl a lollipop in exchange for her sitting still for an injection. When TJ looked at him, clearly taken aback by the unexpected compliment, Cyrus felt his face flush. \u201cI mean\u2026 You definitely made the right career choice.\u201d</p><p>TJ\u2019s surprise softened into fondness, his eyes flicking curiously over Cyrus\u2019 pinkening face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not too bad yourself, you know?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d TJ said, placing a steady hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u00a0<i>More\u00a0</i>than great.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the touch of TJ\u2019s fingertips, Cyrus\u2019 skin sizzled and ached with longing. It seeped into his veins and punctured his heart, oozing a strange combination of fear and excitement that flooded his chest with warmth.</p><p>\u201cThank you, TJ,\u201d he said, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>They were standing so close that TJ could probably feel the heat of Cyrus\u2019 blush in the tight space between them. If it weren\u2019t for the little girl happily sucking on the strawberry lollipop in her bed right next to them, Cyrus might\u2019ve done something stupid, like lean forward and kiss the other man. In fact, he might\u2019ve kissed him anyway \u2013 privacy be damned \u2013 if one the attendings hadn\u2019t suddenly appeared and stolen the fellow away from him.</p><p>While TJ was going over some charts with the attending in the corner of the room, occasionally glancing over the elderly woman\u2019s shoulder and meeting his eyes with a secret smile, Cyrus busied himself by smoothing the sheets at the end of the little girl\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying your lollipop?\u201d he asked her, trying his best to ignore the heat of TJ\u2019s distant gaze.</p><p>The girl swung her head up and down. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re braver than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be terrified of needles when I was your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a doctor?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus laughed. \u201cYeah, well\u2026 I\u2019m a doctor in training. But the needles still freak me out a little bit.\u201d He glanced around the room, pretending to make sure no one could hear them, then leaned across the bed and pressed a finger to his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s our little secret, okay?\u201d</p><p>The girl giggled and nodded, using her lollipop to draw an invisible cross over her heart. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a star.\u201d Cyrus lifted his hand, and the girl slapped a high-five onto his palm. \u201cMaybe you can teach me how to be as brave as\u00a0<i>you\u00a0</i>are someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>When he turned away from the bed, Cyrus was surprised to find TJ watching him from across the room, his eyes lidded softly. Despite the attending still yapping in his ear, TJ\u2019s attention was fixed solely on him, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t seem to wrangle himself free from the fellow\u2019s unwavering gaze. Probably because he didn\u2019t want to. It felt nice to have someone look at him like that, even if it was just a well-rehearsed act for flirting with random men.</p><p><i>It doesn\u2019t feel like an act</i>, a voice whispered in his heart.</p><p>Cyrus sucked in a deep breath, still staring intensely at TJ, then allowed himself to smile. It felt dangerous, succumbing to this, but he didn\u2019t care. Especially when TJ returned his smile with a boyish grin that made his eyes dance like scattered sunlight cascading through the trees.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening?\u201d he heard the attending say.</p><p>TJ tore his eyes away from Cyrus and cleared his throat. \u201cSorry, yes. Go on\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><p>As the attending continued to ramble, TJ flicked one last smirk across the room, and Cyrus felt his heart soar. It was like being back in High School, passing suggestive notes under the desk and grinning like an idiot every time your hands brushed.</p><p>\u201cI think Dr. Kippen likes you,\u201d the little girl said, leaning across the bed to poke Cyrus in the arm. Her strawberry-tinted lips were stretched into an impish smile. \u201cDo you like him back?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus blushed furiously. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 Um\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix and three quarters,\u201d the girl said, sitting up straight to make herself seem bigger.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Cyrus reached forward and ruffled her hair. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re\u00a0<i>quite\u00a0</i>old enough to understand \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks at you the way my daddy looks at my mommy,\u201d the girl interjected, jutting out her chin defiantly. \u201cHe never looks at other boys like that. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus felt his stomach drop. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d The girl ripped the lollipop out of her mouth and waved it impatiently in the air. \u201cDo you like him or not?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus risked a glance across the room. Even from this distance, he could still appreciate the fellow\u2019s profile \u2013 the long slope of his nose; the sandy swoop of his hair; the delicate curve of his smile\u2026 There was no denying how handsome TJ was, just as there was no denying his ever-deepening feelings for the other man.</p><p>\u201cYes, I like him,\u201d Cyrus admitted with a sigh of defeat. \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>By the time Cyrus dragged himself into the interns\u2019 locker room at the end of his shift, it was verging on ten o\u2019clock, the crisp morning light he\u2019d last seen filtering through the boxy window at the back of the room now reduced to a deep, almost inky black. It was a few weeks shy of winter, and the nights were now long, dark, and cold. He was almost tempted to return to the paediatrics ward, where the corridors were bright and warm, and TJ\u2019s dazzling smile was there to keep him company. But after sixteen hours of stitching gashes, poking needles, and splinting broken bones \u2013 all the while trying not to spontaneously combust every time TJ so much as looked at him \u2013 all he really wanted to do was go home and get some rest.</p><p>He was pulling a dark green sweater over his head when someone else came through the door, silencing the idle chatter of the interns dotted around the room. Confused, Cyrus wriggled his head into the light and peered around the lockers, barely containing a gasp when he saw TJ standing in the doorway. The moment their eyes met, the fellow turned to the other interns and swapped his easy smile for an intimidating glare.</p><p>\u201cClear the room,\u201d he said, the commanding tone of his voice leaving no room for argument. \u201cI need to have a word with Goodman.\u201d</p><p>It only took a handful of seconds for the interns to follow orders, all of them practically tripping over each other in their haste to get out of the room. When the last of them had disappeared, leaving him and TJ alone, the fellow closed the door and joined Cyrus by the lockers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2026 I wanted to talk to you before you left.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus tugged nervously at the hem of his sweater. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you how great you were today,\u201d TJ said, stammering slightly as a light blush crept up his neck and blotted his jawline. It was strangely comforting to see a hint of nerves amongst his seemingly limitless supply of confidence; it made him seem more human, and therefore more obtainable. \u201cYou should be really proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Cyrus said, nibbling at the shy smile slowly blooming across his face. A beat of silence passed, and he took a step closer to TJ, daring a glance at the other man\u2019s face \u2013 so close, it was almost blurred. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came here,\u201d he added, his voice breathy. \u201cI wanted to thank you, for being such a good teacher.\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s my\u00a0<i>job</i>, so\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take the compliment,\u201d Cyrus said, rolling his eyes with a teasing smile. \u201cYou were great, too.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, TJ\u2019s face fell slack, and Cyrus was worried he\u2019d overstepped somehow. But then the fellow swallowed thickly, his throat rippling, and reached out to touch Cyrus\u2019 arm, tugging him forward slowly, cautiously, giving him the option to resist if he wanted to\u2026 But saying no to this was the\u00a0<i>last\u00a0</i>thing he wanted, so he stayed where he was, eyes falling closed and lips parting slightly, waiting for the warm pressure of TJ\u2019s mouth against his own. And when it finally arrived, the breath hitching in his throat and stars swimming behind his eyelids, it was everything he\u2019d hoped for and more.\u00a0<i>So much more</i>.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he mumbled as they pulled apart, his hands fisting in the lapels of TJ\u2019s coat. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnexpected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed, breathless and giddy. \u201cBut, also no.\u201d</p><p>TJ lifted an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have been flirting with me or a while now. I mean, you\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to respond to subtlety,\u201d TJ said, smirking slightly as his fingers brushed the back of Cyrus\u2019 neck, \u201cso I had to kick it up a notch.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He placed a hand on TJ\u2019s chest and chuckled, already leaning in for another kiss. \u201cYou really\u00a0<i>are\u00a0</i>a good teacher\u2026\u201d</p><p>Before their lips could connect for a second time, TJ pulled away, the warmth of his fingers slipping from Cyrus\u2019 neck. \u201cAre we still talking about paediatrics?\u201d he asked, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cyrus said, winking clumsily. \u201cAmongst other things.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in once again, but TJ rebuffed him, his lips thinning into a grimace as he loosened Cyrus\u2019 grip on his coat. \u201cHang on,\u201d he said, keeping Cyrus an arm\u2019s length away. \u201cWas\u2026 Was that your first kiss with a guy?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus winced. \u201cIs that problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-You said you wanted to teach me,\u201d Cyrus said. He heard the desperation in his own voice and cringed, a distant echo of shame pounding in his ears. He clenched his fists and tried again. \u201cYou said you would teach me, and I\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d TJ closed his eyes and inhaled through his noise, like he was trying to keep his temper in check. When he opened them again, Cyrus saw the pity staring back at him and shrank away, embarrassed and ashamed and\u00a0<i>confused</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, Cyrus. And I like you. I really do, but\u2026 I\u2019ve done my coming out already. I can\u2019t go through that again, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new to this. I get that. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to figure yourself out and everything. But I don\u2019t wanna be a part of it.\u201d He shook his head and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t teach you how to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help with paediatrics? I\u2019m there. But not with this.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus hunched his shoulders, a flash of anger slicing through the muddle of emotions storming inside his chest. \u201cSo, what? I\u2019m not\u00a0<i>experienced\u00a0</i>enough for you? Is that it?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d TJ exclaimed, tearing a hand through his hair. The violent swipe of his fingers ruffled the gel-stiffened waves, fluffing them out and sending locks of hair flopping over his forehead. He looked much better like that, despite everything. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna help you out of the closet, okay? That\u2019s something you\u2019ve gotta do by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d TJ said grimly. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve spent years learning to accept yourself, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d Cyrus said, sniffing back tears.</p><p>TJ cocked his head in agreement. \u201cFair enough. But that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d He flitted his eyes over Cyrus\u2019 face once more, his breath catching in hesitation, then finally turned around. With his hand on the door, he flicked a parting glance over his shoulder and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, he was gone.</p><p>~~ ~~~</p><p>\u201cWhat an ass,\u201d Buffy said, crushing an empty can of soda in her fist with one squeeze. Outside, the rain was screaming and whirling like an angry spirit, and the three of them were waiting it out in the cafeteria. \u201cDo you want me to talk to him? Beat him up for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus snorted. \u201cThanks, Buffy\u2026 But, no. I just wanna forget about him altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem really upset,\u201d Andi said softly.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really liked him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged in frustration. Not at Andi, but at himself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I let myself fall for someone like TJ Kippen. I mean, he probably flirts with anything that moves! I should\u2019ve known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Buffy assured him. \u201cHe led you on, Cyrus. We all saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI thought he actually liked me. It\u00a0<i>felt\u00a0</i>like he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe manipulated you.\u201d</p><p>Andi frowned. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Buffy said, her eyebrows lifting incredulously. \u201cHe\u2019s been flirting with Cyrus for weeks, and the moment he had him where he wanted him, he changed his mind. It was all just a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to come out,\u201d Andi shot back, making Buffy flinch in surprise. \u201cWhen Amber asked me out, I was a mess. I\u2019d never been with another girl before. And if it hadn\u2019t been for her patience and understanding \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2013 we probably wouldn\u2019t be together right now. But it isn\u2019t so easy for everyone.\u201d She turned away from Buffy and took Cyrus\u2019 hand, sweeping a comforting thumb over his knuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how difficult it was for TJ to come out. It might not be something he wants to revisit, and you asking him to walk you through the basics of being gay isn\u2019t gonna help that.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus balked. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I wanted! I just\u2026 I wanted to learn from him because I\u00a0<i>like\u00a0</i>him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Andi said. \u201cYou wanted him to teach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest with yourself, Cy. Try and see things from TJ\u2019s point of view.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus thought back to their conversation in the locker room, how quickly TJ\u2019s softness had hardened into rejection the moment he\u2019d realised how inexperienced Cyrus was, the distance in his eyes when he\u2019d turned him down\u2026 He didn\u2019t want to be Cyrus\u2019 teacher. That much was obvious. But what if the rest of it had been real? What if Cyrus really\u00a0<i>was\u00a0</i>the one in the wrong here?</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he whispered to himself, the blood draining from his face as realisation dawned on him. \u201cHe thought I was using him.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled knowingly. \u201cAnd you thought\u00a0<i>he\u00a0</i>was using\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on a second,\u201d Buffy interrupted, wagging a finger in the air as she struggled to catch up. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus thought TJ rejected him because he was inexperienced,\u201d Andi explained in a slow, patronising tone of voice. She was clearly enjoying being ahead of Buffy for once. \u201cBut TJ actually rejected him because he thought Cyrus was using him to\u00a0<i>gain\u00a0</i>experience. Do you get it now?\u201d</p><p>Buffy folded her arms and grumbled. \u201cI suppose\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d Cyrus said, his mind still buzzing with a thousand fleeting thoughts, \u201che didn\u2019t need to turn me down so abruptly. I mean, he didn\u2019t even let me explain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus.\u201d Andi squeezed his hand and smiled. \u201cYou like him, don\u2019t you? You said it yourself. And he likes you. I\u00a0<i>know\u00a0</i>he does. So why are you trying so hard to talk yourself out of this?\u201d She scooted closer across the bench and rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou can\u2019t let a stupid misunderstanding ruin this for you.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, a trembling bundle in his lap, and exhaled a shaky breath. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d he asked, the roaring of the rain outside almost swallowing his words. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t like me because he thinks I\u2019m na\u00efve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u00a0<i>would\u00a0</i>be an ass,\u201d Andi said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Buffy groaned. \u201cI hate to admit, but I think she\u2019s right\u2026 I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. There\u2019s no faking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a guy before,\u201d Cyrus whimpered, stating what they both already knew. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m bad at it? What if I\u00a0<i>do\u00a0</i>need someone to teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gay,\u201d Buffy said simply. \u201cYou don\u2019t need someone to teach you what you already know.\u201d</p><p>Before Cyrus could protest any further, one of the doors leading outside opened with a heavy\u00a0<i>thump</i>, and TJ came stumbling into the cafeteria, thoroughly soaked to the bone. There was water streaming down his face, a sheet of dark blond hair covering his eyes, and his scrubs were completely sodden. Cyrus could do nothing but watch in stunned silence as the fellow shook himself out like a large dog and blindly collapsed into a nearby chair. It was only when he swept the hair out of his eyes that he noticed Cyrus watching him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cI, um\u2026 I\u2019ll go somewhere else \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you outside?\u201d Buffy asked him, her expression flitting between amused and repulsed. \u201cYou know it\u2019s pouring it down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very smart for a fellow, are you?\u201d</p><p>TJ gave her a tight, acidic smile. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t been here long, intern, but not every ward in this hospital is conveniently connected by corridors.\u201d</p><p>Buffy simply glowered in response.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, guys,\u201d Andi said, smiling nervously as she attempted to smooth things over. \u201cWe\u2019re all adults, aren\u2019t we? I\u2019m sure we can sit here without arguing until the rain stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d TJ scraped back his chair and got to his feet, the soles of his shoes squeaking against the wet floor. For a brief moment, his eyes landed on Cyrus, but they quickly danced away and returned to the rain lashing against the windows instead. \u201cWish me luck, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus was standing before he\u2019d even decided to follow him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, the rain \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little water\u2019s not gonna hurt me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut losing TJ will.\u201d</p><p>Buffy gagged. \u201cOkay, I know you\u2019re in love and everything, but there was no need for that level of cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her,\u201d Andi said, beaming as she reached out and squeezed Cyrus\u2019 hand. \u201cGo get him, Cy!\u201d</p><p>As soon as he opened the door, the rain hit him like a thousand flecks of ice, instantly raising the hair on his arms and turning his cheeks a deep, stinging shade of pink. But there was no going back now. He could see TJ\u2019s retreating form just ahead, quickly fading in the grey smudge of rain sweeping across his vision. If he didn\u2019t move now, he would lose him, and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able find the courage to confront him like this again.</p><p>So he ran.</p><p>\u201cTJ!\u201d The wind picked up his words and tossed them into the sky, becoming one with the rain and sinking into the wet earth beneath his feet. \u201cTJ, wait!\u201d</p><p>With his nose buried in the crook of his arm to shield his face from the storm, he chased after the distant speck of white with all the energy he could muster. By the time his hand latched onto the soggy tail of TJ\u2019s coat, his legs were burning, despite the rain leeching through his scrubs, and he could barely breathe enough air into his lungs to spit out a single word. But, luckily, TJ didn\u2019t shove him away like he\u2019d expected him to. He stood there, quiet and grim, as Cyrus caught his breath, seemingly indifferent to the darkening clouds above their heads, and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I need\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>TJ looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re only making this harder, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I understand?\u201d he asked, spraying Cyrus with droplets of rain as he whipped around to face him. \u201cYou\u2019re new to the whole coming out thing. You wanna have some fun, figure yourself out\u2026 I get it. But I\u2019m not interested in playing a one-time part in your journey to self-discovery. I want something that\u2019s gonna last, okay? A relationship that\u00a0<i>means\u00a0</i>something, for once. And you\u2019re obviously not looking for that kind of thing, so \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I\u2019m looking for!\u201d Cyrus yelled. \u201cJust because I\u2019m inexperienced, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ignorant. I\u2019ve known what I want for a very long time. And for some bizarre reason,\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0happen to be it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with one of my best friends when I was thirteen. I\u2019ve known I was gay for almost half my life. So don\u2019t you\u00a0<i>dare\u00a0</i>stand there and accuse me of not understanding the struggles of learning to accept yourself, because\u00a0<i>I\u2019ve\u00a0</i>lived it too! And just because I\u2019ve never been with another guy before, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not sure of who I am, or what I want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you don\u2019t want the responsibility of being my first boyfriend. Maybe you\u2019re scared it will be awkward and difficult and too much work.\u00a0<i>I understand that</i>. But that doesn\u2019t give you the right to jump to conclusions and ignore me!\u201d</p><p>At this point, TJ was smirking, and Cyrus could feel his anger rising and rising, like a pot of water close to boiling over.</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d the fellow asked, taking a step towards him.\u00a0</p><p>Cyrus shoved him away and growled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not done yet! Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done to me? I\u2019ve spent nearly thirteen years hiding from who I really am,\u00a0<i>terrified\u00a0</i>of getting hurt all over again. I\u2019ve been hiding for so long that I forgot what it felt like to be\u00a0<i>me</i>.\u201d He shook his head, half-choking on a sob. \u201cAnd then you kissed me, and I felt like I\u00a0<i>existed\u00a0</i>again.\u201d</p><p>TJ stopped smirking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this means to you. I don\u2019t know if you like flirting with me, and that\u2019s it, or if you actually wanna be with me. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I was a goner the moment you winked at me.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. It felt good to be honest. It felt like the rain - \u00a0crazy and reckless and\u00a0<i>real</i>. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m inexperienced. And awkward. And I tend to say the wrong things at the wrong times.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m also nice. And loyal. And my friends think I\u2019m a catch. So if you still wanna turn me down, that\u2019s fine. But if you decide to give this a chance, you won\u2019t regret it, because \u2013\u201d</p><p>The rest of his words were swallowed by a kiss.</p><p>Cyrus made a little squawk of surprise as TJ\u2019s lips melted against his own, all of his pent up frustration seeping out of him within seconds, leaving him weightless and airy, elastic and free\u2026 He clutched onto TJ\u2019s shoulders and whimpered slightly, losing himself to the melodic\u00a0<i>whoosh\u00a0</i>of the rain as TJ pulled him impossibly closer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you liked me,\u201d he mumbled between kisses, gently tucking the hair behind Cyrus\u2019 ears. \u201cI thought\u2026 I thought \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He cupped TJ\u2019s face and pressed their foreheads together, breathing him in. \u201cYou have nothing to apologise for. I\u2019m the idiot who made you think you were nothing more than a\u00a0<i>practice\u00a0</i>boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus froze, his face flushing darkly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me you didn\u2019t mean to call me your boyfriend, I\u2019m gonna be really upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2026 You\u00a0<i>want\u00a0</i>me to call you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d TJ tilted his head to the side, revealing the wicked slice of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth. \u201cLike you said, I\u2019ve been flirting with you for a while now. And\u00a0<i>this\u00a0</i>is what usually comes after the flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u00a0<i>is</i>\u00a0this exactly?\u201d</p><p>TJ shrugged, the confidence\u00a0in his smile not quite reaching his eyes. \u201cMe asking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u00a0<i>yeah</i>. Unless you don\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just chased you through a storm in nothing but scrubs and poured out my heart to you like we\u2019re in a Hallmark movie, and you honestly don\u2019t think I wanna be your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d he laughed, palming the back of TJ\u2019s neck and kissing him softly. All around them, the sky shivered and wept, bathing them in tears of joy as they clung onto each other for dear life,\u00a0laughing and hugging and basking in the rain.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus tugged the fleece blanket over his shoulders and tucked it under his chin, shuddering with relief as the heat pulsing from the radiator slowly filled the on-call room. He could still feel the occasional drop of rain rolling down his spine, but at least he could also feel his toes again. And the hot cocoa TJ had placed in his hands a few minutes ago was quickly thawing his icy palms as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d his said, lips trembling as he took a tentative sip from the steaming cup. The burn was delicious.</p><p>TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer, until he was practically sitting on his lap. Despite being equally soaked, TJ seemed to radiate warmth at all times, and Cyrus couldn\u2019t resist snuggling against his boyfriend\u2019s \u2013 yes,\u00a0<i>boyfriend\u2019s\u00a0</i>\u2013 chest. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou smell like rain,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s quite nice, actually.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, ear pressed against the steady beating of TJ\u2019s heart. The sudden shift from freezing to cosy was taking its toll, making him feel sluggish and loose-lipped. He had no idea what he was going to say until the words tumbled out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you only kiss me to shut me up?\u201d</p><p>TJ chuckled. \u201cHow could I\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0kiss you when you were being so damn cute?\u201d He threaded his fingers through Cyrus\u2019 hair, gently undoing all the frazzled knots left behind by the rain. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry for interrupting your Hallmark speech. What else were you gonna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was more or less done,\u201d Cyrus admitted. \u201cI was just gonna reassure you that you wouldn\u2019t have to go through the drama of coming out all over again.\u201d</p><p>TJ sighed, shifting on the bed so Cyrus was laying across his legs, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I said the other day,\u201d he said quietly, his fingers resuming their careful exploration of Cyrus\u2019 hair. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna be involved in another shame spiral, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not spiralling,\u201d Cyrus told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m definitely not ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He reached up and touched TJ\u2019s face, tracing the fine bones beneath his lightly-stubbled cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>TJ grinned. \u201cWow, you\u2019re a sap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m just getting started\u2026\u201d</p><p>When their lips were mere inches apart, TJ\u2019s pager started buzzing at his hip, and Cyrus was caught between laughter and tears as he moved off the fellow\u2019s lap so he could check it. All he wanted to do was stay in this tiny room, with the lights low and the rain pattering against the window, and kiss his boyfriend. But when there were little kids with scraped knees and poorly tummies waiting for his assistance,\u00a0Cyrus didn\u2019t mind letting him go. This was the life they\u2019d both chosen for themselves, after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d TJ huffed, already half-standing. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p><p>Cyrus gave him a sleepy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stay here and rest for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><p>The next thing he knew, TJ was gently prying the half-empty cup from his hands and lowering his head onto a pillow. Cyrus could hear the smile in his voice as he leaned over and kissed the sensitive spot behind his ear, whispering goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come find you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s being a sap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d TJ said simply, planting one last kiss on Cyrus\u2019 forehead as he got to his feet. \u00a0</p><p>Before he could leave, Cyrus grabbed onto his elbow and ushered him closer. TJ obliged with a fond little smile, crouching down beside the bed, and allowed Cyrus to kiss him on the lips once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too,\u201d Cyrus murmured softly, bumping their noses together.</p><p>After a few more parting kisses (with Cyrus promising each one would be the last) TJ managed to escape the on-call room, pausing briefly in the doorway to wave Cyrus goodbye and mockingly blow him a kiss. Joke or not, Cyrus still pretended to catch it mid-air and press it against his mouth, to which TJ blushed like a schoolboy and walked backwards into the wall, before stammering a final goodbye and disappearing down the corridor. Cyrus stared at the spot where the fellow had once stood until his eyelids began to droop closed. \u00a0</p><p>He\u2019d barely been asleep for five minutes when the door slammed open again, no doubt leaving a mark where it collided with the wall. His eyes sprang open as he sat bolt upright, only to find Buffy and Andi standing in the middle of the room, pointing at him accusingly with their mouths gaping open.</p><p>\u201cYou both look ridiculous,\u201d he said, collapsing back against his pillow.</p><p>\u201cWe saw you kissing TJ in the rain!\u201d Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>Andi nodded in agreement. \u201cYes! We saw you through the window!\u00a0<i>Cyrus\u00a0</i>\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026 We kissed. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s TJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr should we say, where\u2019s your\u00a0<i>boyfriend</i>?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus shrugged. \u201cWell, considering TJ and I are dating now, I guess you\u00a0<i>should\u00a0</i>say that.\u201d</p><p>All at once, Buffy and Andi were crowded around him, jumping on the bed and shaking his arms as they bombarded him with a thousand overlapping questions. He didn\u2019t say a word, just sat there and soaked in the attention with a smug little smile, his thoughts slipping back to TJ. The dirty-blond in the dark blue scrubs. The paediatrics fellow.\u00a0<i>His boyfriend</i>.</p><p>And for the first time in almost thirteen years, he actually felt like himself again.</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p><i>Thank you again for your patience, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6bUlRhshKvuSxiEWBPW-yw\">@tyrusflavoredtea</a>.

You don&rsquo;t need to watch Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy to read this fic.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p>It was barely six in the morning when Cyrus shuffled into The Pit, one hand wrapped around a&nbsp;paper cup of coffee while the other sluggishly patted his pillow-mussed hair into shape. The sun was still making its slow ascent into the sky, spilling its morning glow across the ambulance bay outside, but Shadyside Hospital was already alive with people &ndash; patients and practitioners alike. As always, the air was buzzing with a frantic, suspenseful energy, but Cyrus had a feeling that today&rsquo;s shift was going to be even crazier than usual.</p><p>As soon as he spotted Andi and Buffy standing next to a row of gurneys&nbsp;on the side of the room, Cyrus downed the last of his coffee, dumped his cup in the nearest bin, and dragged himself across The Pit to join them. His presence was met with a couple of weary nods.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning, Cy,&rdquo; Andi greeted him, blinking her tired eyes open as she attempted a small smile. &ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus groaned. &ldquo;Too well&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t wanna leave my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You two are depressing,&rdquo; Buffy said with the quirk of an eyebrow. Despite the dark smudges beneath her eyes, she seemed relatively well-rested, and Cyrus envied her for it. &ldquo;Whose service are you on today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No clue,&rdquo; Cyrus said. He stifled a yawn with the back of his hand and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably be stuck in the clinic again, knowing my luck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The clinic isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grunt work, and you know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy opened her mouth to protest, then changed her mind, probably deciding it was too early in the morning for a debate. &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re right. It isn&rsquo;t great in there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never worked a&nbsp;<i>day</i>&nbsp;in the clinic,&rdquo; Andi said, shooting Buffy a teasing glare. &ldquo;The residents probably fight over you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault everyone wants me on their service.&rdquo; Buffy cracked her knuckles and grinned, playfully rolling her eyes at Andi&rsquo;s unimpressed expression. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t look at me like that&hellip; You&rsquo;re the one&nbsp;<i>dating&nbsp;</i>a resident.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi folded her arms defensively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never asked Amber to do me any favours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you have. But if anyone&rsquo;s got an advantage here, it&rsquo;s definitely you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Please stop bickering,&rdquo; Cyrus pleaded, gingerly rubbing his temples to ease the pounding in his head. The bright lights of The Pit never failed to give him a headache, especially when he was still in the process of waking up. &ldquo;I would give anything to be put on radiology today,&rdquo; he continued groggily. &ldquo;Somewhere dark and quiet, where I could nap in peace&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy punched him in the shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a surgical intern,&rdquo; she said, as if he needed reminding. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to&nbsp;<i>nap</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. Sleep is a thing of the past for people like us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so dramatic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, flapping his arms like a bird caught in a net. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<i>tired</i>. And when I&rsquo;m tired, I get cranky. And when I&rsquo;m cranky, I get dramatic. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you better reel it in,&rdquo; Buffy said, dropping her voice to an urgent whisper. &ldquo;Dr. Metcalf&rsquo;s coming over.&rdquo;</p><p>Within seconds, the Chief of Surgery was looming over them, wearing his signature frown as he carefully surveyed the interns with a pair of sharp, judgemental eyes. After a few moments of tense silence, the older man wrinkled his nose and leaned back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you three have someplace to be?&rdquo; he asked, phrasing the question like a warning.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Metcalf,&rdquo; Andi and Buffy squeaked in unison, their eyes as wide as dinner plates. When Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say a word, they both turned to him with questioning looks of horror.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually know whose service I&rsquo;m on today,&rdquo; he hurried to explain, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p>Dr. Metcalf sighed. &ldquo;The incompetency of you interns is astonishing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise. Just get to work!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go with the first resident you see for today. But don&rsquo;t let this kind of amateur mistake happen again. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gulped. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as Dr. Metcalf walked away, Cyrus allowed himself to breathe again, his wobbly legs giving way as he slumped against Buffy&rsquo;s side for support.</p><p>&ldquo;I think I just peed myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi snorted. &ldquo;Are you okay, Cy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Just traumatised. Nothing major.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There you go again with the dramatics,&rdquo; Buffy said, shoving him off with a shrug. As she was pressing the crinkles out of her scrubs, her eyes landed on something across the room, and a devious smirk appeared on her lips. &ldquo;Well, I guess that answers the question of whose service you&rsquo;re on today.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Cyrus could ask any questions, Buffy grabbed his chin and turned his head to the right, pointing his gaze towards a dirty-blond man in dark blue scrubs standing at the opposite end of The Pit, his green eyes scrolling up and down the tablet in his hands.</p><p><i>TJ Kippen</i>. Or, as Buffy and Andi liked to call him,&nbsp;<i>Cyrus&rsquo; big fat crush</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Cyrus said, shaking his head as he took a step backwards, accidentally stumbling into a (thankfully) empty bed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t work with that guy&hellip; No way!&rdquo;</p><p>Andi sidled up to Buffy with a matching smirk. &ldquo;Dr. Metcalf&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>tell you to go with the first resident you see. You don&rsquo;t want to disobey the Chief of Surgery, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, he&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<i>fellow</i>&nbsp;&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still counts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo; &ndash; and I can just pretend I never saw him,&rdquo; Cyrus said, frantically scanning The Pit for any signs of another resident. The room was swarming with pale blue scrubs and white coats, but TJ Kippen was the only spot of darkness in sight. It was hopeless. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spend the entire day one-to-one with him,&rdquo; Cyrus insisted. &ldquo;What if he &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Winks at you again?&rdquo; Buffy suggested, biting back a grin as Andi smothered her giggles with the sleeve of her coat. &ldquo;Oh, the horror!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is serious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only flirting with you,&rdquo; Andi said, taking a deep breath to compose herself. &ldquo;Maybe he likes you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a guy!&rdquo; Cyrus hissed, instant heat rushing to his cheeks as a couple of heads turned their way. As soon as the attention had shifted away from them, he lowered his voice and continued, &ldquo;A guy&rsquo;s never flirted with me before. What am I supposed to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You let him down gently.&rdquo; Andi flicked a glance at Buffy, her eyebrows raised in a silent question, then turned back to Cyrus with a shrug. &ldquo;Unless you don&rsquo;t want to, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus blanched. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; You do talk about him a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you do,&rdquo; Buffy said, scraping her hair into a bun on top of her head. The pager at her hip started buzzing as soon as she dropped her arms, and she answered it without hesitation. &ldquo;Well, I wish I could stay here and talk some sense into you all morning, but some of us have work to do.&rdquo; And with that, she pinched his cheek and made her way towards the double doors leading to the rest of the hospital, turning at the last second to give him a thumbs up. &ldquo;Just go with your gut,&rdquo; she shouted across The Pit. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine!&rdquo;</p><p>A few minutes later, when the bustling crowds slowly started to thin out, Andi bit her lip and sighed. &ldquo;I better get going too,&rdquo; she said, offering Cyrus a sympathetic smile as he desperately clung to her arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Cy. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything you don&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gulped. &ldquo;But&hellip; What if I don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;what I want to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, now&rsquo;s your chance to figure it out.&rdquo; She patted his hand and kissed his cheek, giving him a moment to gather his nerves, then pulled away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at lunch, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, a sickly pallor washing his cheeks as he forced himself to nod. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p><p>With Andi and Buffy both gone, and the rest of the interns slowly trickling out of The Pit, Cyrus had no choice but to force his jellified legs across the room and formally introduce himself. Besides a few snatched looks across the operation table, and a couple of unexpected winks thrown his way in passing, he and TJ had never really interacted before. Cyrus had always tried to keep his distance, afraid of what he might do if he were left alone with the frustratingly charming paediatrician for too long. But apparently, he couldn&rsquo;t avoid the other man forever.</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; Hello,&rdquo; Cyrus said as he approached TJ, anxiously wringing his hands together. He could already feel the nervous sweat beading on his skin, and his face was practically starting to smoke as the blush in his cheeks grew darker and darker, almost reaching the tips of his ears by the time TJ finally turned around and acknowledged him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; the fellow greeted him, the corner of his mouth twitching with a smirk of recognition. &ldquo;Are you on my service today?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus cleared his throat. &ldquo;Not exactly, but&hellip; I-I don&rsquo;t really know where I&rsquo;m supposed to be, so Dr. Metcalf told me to go with the first resident I saw.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you picked me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! I-I mean&hellip; I saw you&nbsp;<i>first</i>, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s gaze skipped over him &ndash; from the toes of his tennis shoes, all the way up to the unartfully-tousled mop of hair on top of his head &ndash; and finally settled on the spot between his eyes. After a moment of consideration, he made a humming noise and took a step closer, his flirtatious smile almost brushing against the shell of Cyrus&rsquo; ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Lucky me,&rdquo; he whispered.</p><p>A bolt of attraction pierced through Cyrus&rsquo; chest, taking him by surprise. He tore his eyes away from TJ and coughed into his fist, internally begging the heat in his face to finally subside, before it melted the skin off his cheekbones.</p><p>&ldquo;You look nervous,&rdquo; TJ observed, sounding genuinely concerned. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus nodded a little too enthusiastically. &ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m fine, I just&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never done, um&hellip; p-paediatrics&hellip; before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; TJ tilted his head to the side, probably wondering if Cyrus had deliberately injected as much implication as possible into that sentence, then gave him a friendly clap on the back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk you through it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right! Yes. Exactly. Um&hellip; Thank you, TJ. I mean&hellip;&nbsp;<i>Dr. Kippen</i>. Sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean to &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; TJ said, his eyes twinkling with laughter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Cyrus, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I try to familiarise myself with all the interns. Especially the cute ones.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus spluttered a nervous laugh and ducked his head, studiously avoiding TJ&rsquo;s eyes. He hadn&rsquo;t expected the fellow to be so forward with his flirting. A couple of winks in the corridor was one thing, but face-to-face compliments? He hadn&rsquo;t prepared himself for that. How was he supposed to respond?</p><p>&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; TJ said, as if he could sense the mental breakdown currently taking place inside his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only messing with you.&rdquo;</p><p>For some reason, that didn&rsquo;t make him feel any better. If anything, it made him feel worse.&nbsp;<i>Disappointed</i>. Did TJ flirt like this with all the interns? Was Cyrus nothing more than an easily-flustered nerd for him to play games with? Or was he completely overthinking this and acting like an idiot? It was probably the latter.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, smiling and exhaling at the same time. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a little on edge.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ grinned. &ldquo;Little kids aren&rsquo;t that scary, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the parents I&rsquo;m most worried about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now&nbsp;<i>that&rsquo;s&nbsp;</i>a legitimate fear.&rdquo;</p><p>The two of them shared a smile, and Cyrus could feel the blush finally draining from his cheeks. When he wasn&rsquo;t overanalysing every little thing TJ did, the man wasn&rsquo;t too difficult to get along with. He was actually pretty nice. And&hellip; handsome? There was no point in denying it, especially inside his own head. TJ Kippen was a very handsome man, and Cyrus was at least 60% attracted to him. Maybe even more. Well,&nbsp;<i>definitely&nbsp;</i>more, but that wasn&rsquo;t the point. Cyrus had never felt so comfortable about his sexuality &ndash; a thing only he, Buffy, and Andi were aware of &ndash; before. It was refreshing.</p><p>&ldquo;We should probably get a move on,&rdquo; TJ said, glancing down at his pager. When he looked back up at Cyrus, his usual smirk had fallen into place again. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a broken arm with your name on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; Yay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love the enthusiasm.&ldquo; TJ gave him a quick wink, then spun on his heels and marched towards the doors. With his considerably long legs, it only took him a few strides to reach the other end of The Pit, leaving Cyrus standing by himself with his mouth hanging open. &ldquo;Follow me, intern!&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus scrambled after him, the tail of his too-long coat slapping against the backs of his thighs as he rushed across the room. For the next few minutes, he followed TJ through the hospital, slipping through dense crowds and dodging incoming trolleys and wheelchairs as TJ seamlessly glided down the corridors. He clearly knew his way around the hospital, and Cyrus didn&rsquo;t know whether to be impressed or intimidated.</p><p>&ldquo;You still with me?&rdquo; TJ asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Cyrus shouted a breathless &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in response, almost running straight into the fellow&rsquo;s back as he came to a sudden stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank god,&rdquo; Cyrus muttered under his breath.</p><p>TJ turned to him with a smile. He was standing with his arms folded in an authoritative kind of stance, but Cyrus could see the childlike excitement brimming beneath the surface. He obviously adored his job, and he couldn&rsquo;t wait to share it with someone. Cyrus was just glad he got to be that lucky someone.</p><p>&ldquo;This is this paediatrics ward,&rdquo; TJ said, tapping a few things on his tablet as he swept Cyrus into a large room covered in stickers, paintings, and colourful posters.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Cyrus said, his heart fluttering at TJ&rsquo;s responding grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Impressive, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All of the paintings were made by the kids,&rdquo; TJ explained as he guided Cyrus deeper into the room, taking a left at the end of the beds and down a corridor flanked by private rooms, some of them with crudely decorated nameplates hanging on the doors. &ldquo;Painting seems to relax them, you know? The parents, too.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus smiled at the back of TJ&rsquo;s head, privately admiring the obvious affection the fellow had for his patients. &ldquo;Looks like there&rsquo;s a few budding artists in here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; TJ huffed a laugh. &ldquo;Some of these kids are scarily talented. All of them, really, in their own little ways.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really care about them, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ paused, his back still turned to Cyrus. The stiff set of the fellow&rsquo;s shoulders made him worry he&rsquo;d said something wrong, but when TJ turned to face him, his eyes were as bright as the radiant smile dimpling his cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said sincerely. &ldquo;Working here&hellip; I&rsquo;ve seen some stuff that&rsquo;s changed me, made me wanna throw in the towel and get out of medicine altogether. It&rsquo;s not always easy, taking the responsibility of a child&rsquo;s life into your hands.&rdquo; He scrubbed a hand over his face, a shuddering breath passing between his fingers. &ldquo;But then I think of all the kids I&rsquo;ve saved, all the ones that still pay me visits and send me thank you cards, and it makes everything else worth it. The bad times. The&nbsp;<i>hard&nbsp;</i>times.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;Working in paediatrics is the most rewarding thing I&rsquo;ve ever done.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus swallowed thickly, his fingers twitching with the urge to reach out and comfort the other man. But then TJ blinked, and the unshed tears in his eyes were replaced by a familiar hint of playful arrogance that made Cyrus&rsquo; heart stutter with uncontrollable desire.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry for the sob story,&rdquo; TJ said, flashing him a smile. &ldquo;I guess I can&rsquo;t control myself around cute guys.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus spluttered. &ldquo;Wait, what? Are you telling me that was just an elaborate pickup line?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it was true,&rdquo; TJ said, his lips twitching as he fought back a smirk. &ldquo;I really&nbsp;<i>do</i>&nbsp;love the kids here, and working in paediatrics really&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>the most rewarding thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. But I need to exaggerate it a little bit for the guys, you know? The sad, brooding doctor act&nbsp;<i>never&nbsp;</i>fails to work wonders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; kinda messed up.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shook his head. &ldquo;Nah. The kids here are constantly bugging me about my love life. They&rsquo;re kinda like my mini wingmen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick,&rdquo; Cyrus said, but his words were light with laughter. There was something quite endearing about the thought of TJ&rsquo;s patients being so invested in finding him a boyfriend. But he still couldn&rsquo;t ignore the dull pang of jealousy deep down in his stomach when he pictured TJ recycling the same, meaningless lines on a bunch of other guys who weren&rsquo;t him.</p><p>&ldquo;You say sick, I say smart. Agree to disagree?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus rolled his eyes and smiled. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, neither of them said a word. They just stood there in silence, barely inches apart in the near-empty corridor, and smiled at each other. But then a child started crying a few rooms down, effectively ruining the moment, and they both sprung apart, staring down at the floor and rubbing the backs of their necks like a couple of guilty teenagers.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So, um&hellip;. We should probably stop chatting and actually do some work,&rdquo; TJ said. There was a light dusting of pink on his cheeks, the closest Cyrus had ever seen the fellow to getting flustered, but other than that, he seemed completely unaffected by the unshifting tension in the air. &ldquo;You ready to start?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus licked his lips and nodded. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p><p>The next few hours passed in a blur of wailing children and anxious parents, all of them with an abundance of questions that Cyrus wasn&rsquo;t sure how to answer. Luckily, TJ was always by his side, offering his support whenever he noticed Cyrus struggling. When the fellow was totally immersed in his job, and not trying to woo Cyrus with dazzling smiles and wry comments, he was actually a very gentle and patient person, and Cyrus found himself falling deeper and deeper for the other man as the seconds ticked by.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re good with kids,&rdquo; he blurted out at one point, after TJ had given a little girl a lollipop in exchange for her sitting still for an injection. When TJ looked at him, clearly taken aback by the unexpected compliment, Cyrus felt his face flush. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; You definitely made the right career choice.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ&rsquo;s surprise softened into fondness, his eyes flicking curiously over Cyrus&rsquo; pinkening face. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too bad yourself, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus snorted. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; TJ said, placing a steady hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great.&nbsp;<i>More&nbsp;</i>than great.&rdquo;</p><p>Beneath the touch of TJ&rsquo;s fingertips, Cyrus&rsquo; skin sizzled and ached with longing. It seeped into his veins and punctured his heart, oozing a strange combination of fear and excitement that flooded his chest with warmth.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, TJ,&rdquo; he said, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>They were standing so close that TJ could probably feel the heat of Cyrus&rsquo; blush in the tight space between them. If it weren&rsquo;t for the little girl happily sucking on the strawberry lollipop in her bed right next to them, Cyrus might&rsquo;ve done something stupid, like lean forward and kiss the other man. In fact, he might&rsquo;ve kissed him anyway &ndash; privacy be damned &ndash; if one the attendings hadn&rsquo;t suddenly appeared and stolen the fellow away from him.</p><p>While TJ was going over some charts with the attending in the corner of the room, occasionally glancing over the elderly woman&rsquo;s shoulder and meeting his eyes with a secret smile, Cyrus busied himself by smoothing the sheets at the end of the little girl&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Enjoying your lollipop?&rdquo; he asked her, trying his best to ignore the heat of TJ&rsquo;s distant gaze.</p><p>The girl swung her head up and down. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your arm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re braver than I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I used to be terrified of needles when I was your age.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought you were a doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, well&hellip; I&rsquo;m a doctor in training. But the needles still freak me out a little bit.&rdquo; He glanced around the room, pretending to make sure no one could hear them, then leaned across the bed and pressed a finger to his lips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our little secret, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>The girl giggled and nodded, using her lollipop to draw an invisible cross over her heart. &ldquo;I promise I won&rsquo;t tell!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a star.&rdquo; Cyrus lifted his hand, and the girl slapped a high-five onto his palm. &ldquo;Maybe you can teach me how to be as brave as&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>are someday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p><p>When he turned away from the bed, Cyrus was surprised to find TJ watching him from across the room, his eyes lidded softly. Despite the attending still yapping in his ear, TJ&rsquo;s attention was fixed solely on him, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t seem to wrangle himself free from the fellow&rsquo;s unwavering gaze. Probably because he didn&rsquo;t want to. It felt nice to have someone look at him like that, even if it was just a well-rehearsed act for flirting with random men.</p><p><i>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like an act</i>, a voice whispered in his heart.</p><p>Cyrus sucked in a deep breath, still staring intensely at TJ, then allowed himself to smile. It felt dangerous, succumbing to this, but he didn&rsquo;t care. Especially when TJ returned his smile with a boyish grin that made his eyes dance like scattered sunlight cascading through the trees.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you even listening?&rdquo; he heard the attending say.</p><p>TJ tore his eyes away from Cyrus and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Sorry, yes. Go on&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>As the attending continued to ramble, TJ flicked one last smirk across the room, and Cyrus felt his heart soar. It was like being back in High School, passing suggestive notes under the desk and grinning like an idiot every time your hands brushed.</p><p>&ldquo;I think Dr. Kippen likes you,&rdquo; the little girl said, leaning across the bed to poke Cyrus in the arm. Her strawberry-tinted lips were stretched into an impish smile. &ldquo;Do you like him back?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus blushed furiously. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t&hellip; Um&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as a yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six and three quarters,&rdquo; the girl said, sitting up straight to make herself seem bigger.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Cyrus reached forward and ruffled her hair. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re&nbsp;<i>quite&nbsp;</i>old enough to understand &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He looks at you the way my daddy looks at my mommy,&rdquo; the girl interjected, jutting out her chin defiantly. &ldquo;He never looks at other boys like that. Just you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus felt his stomach drop. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; The girl ripped the lollipop out of her mouth and waved it impatiently in the air. &ldquo;Do you like him or not?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus risked a glance across the room. Even from this distance, he could still appreciate the fellow&rsquo;s profile &ndash; the long slope of his nose; the sandy swoop of his hair; the delicate curve of his smile&hellip; There was no denying how handsome TJ was, just as there was no denying his ever-deepening feelings for the other man.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I like him,&rdquo; Cyrus admitted with a sigh of defeat. &ldquo;I like him a lot.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>By the time Cyrus dragged himself into the interns&rsquo; locker room at the end of his shift, it was verging on ten o&rsquo;clock, the crisp morning light he&rsquo;d last seen filtering through the boxy window at the back of the room now reduced to a deep, almost inky black. It was a few weeks shy of winter, and the nights were now long, dark, and cold. He was almost tempted to return to the paediatrics ward, where the corridors were bright and warm, and TJ&rsquo;s dazzling smile was there to keep him company. But after sixteen hours of stitching gashes, poking needles, and splinting broken bones &ndash; all the while trying not to spontaneously combust every time TJ so much as looked at him &ndash; all he really wanted to do was go home and get some rest.</p><p>He was pulling a dark green sweater over his head when someone else came through the door, silencing the idle chatter of the interns dotted around the room. Confused, Cyrus wriggled his head into the light and peered around the lockers, barely containing a gasp when he saw TJ standing in the doorway. The moment their eyes met, the fellow turned to the other interns and swapped his easy smile for an intimidating glare.</p><p>&ldquo;Clear the room,&rdquo; he said, the commanding tone of his voice leaving no room for argument. &ldquo;I need to have a word with Goodman.&rdquo;</p><p>It only took a handful of seconds for the interns to follow orders, all of them practically tripping over each other in their haste to get out of the room. When the last of them had disappeared, leaving him and TJ alone, the fellow closed the door and joined Cyrus by the lockers.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I wanted to talk to you before you left.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus tugged nervously at the hem of his sweater. &ldquo;Did I do something wrong?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No! Nothing like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just wanted to tell you how great you were today,&rdquo; TJ said, stammering slightly as a light blush crept up his neck and blotted his jawline. It was strangely comforting to see a hint of nerves amongst his seemingly limitless supply of confidence; it made him seem more human, and therefore more obtainable. &ldquo;You should be really proud of yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Cyrus said, nibbling at the shy smile slowly blooming across his face. A beat of silence passed, and he took a step closer to TJ, daring a glance at the other man&rsquo;s face &ndash; so close, it was almost blurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came here,&rdquo; he added, his voice breathy. &ldquo;I wanted to thank you, for being such a good teacher.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s my&nbsp;<i>job</i>, so&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just take the compliment,&rdquo; Cyrus said, rolling his eyes with a teasing smile. &ldquo;You were great, too.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment, TJ&rsquo;s face fell slack, and Cyrus was worried he&rsquo;d overstepped somehow. But then the fellow swallowed thickly, his throat rippling, and reached out to touch Cyrus&rsquo; arm, tugging him forward slowly, cautiously, giving him the option to resist if he wanted to&hellip; But saying no to this was the&nbsp;<i>last&nbsp;</i>thing he wanted, so he stayed where he was, eyes falling closed and lips parting slightly, waiting for the warm pressure of TJ&rsquo;s mouth against his own. And when it finally arrived, the breath hitching in his throat and stars swimming behind his eyelids, it was everything he&rsquo;d hoped for and more.&nbsp;<i>So much more</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he mumbled as they pulled apart, his hands fisting in the lapels of TJ&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;That was&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unexpected?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He laughed, breathless and giddy. &ldquo;But, also no.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ lifted an eyebrow. &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you have been flirting with me or a while now. I mean, you&rsquo;re not exactly subtle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t seem to respond to subtlety,&rdquo; TJ said, smirking slightly as his fingers brushed the back of Cyrus&rsquo; neck, &ldquo;so I had to kick it up a notch.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you approve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He placed a hand on TJ&rsquo;s chest and chuckled, already leaning in for another kiss. &ldquo;You really&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>a good teacher&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Before their lips could connect for a second time, TJ pulled away, the warmth of his fingers slipping from Cyrus&rsquo; neck. &ldquo;Are we still talking about paediatrics?&rdquo; he asked, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Cyrus said, winking clumsily. &ldquo;Amongst other things.&rdquo;</p><p>He leaned in once again, but TJ rebuffed him, his lips thinning into a grimace as he loosened Cyrus&rsquo; grip on his coat. &ldquo;Hang on,&rdquo; he said, keeping Cyrus an arm&rsquo;s length away. &ldquo;Was&hellip; Was that your first kiss with a guy?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus winced. &ldquo;Is that problem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&nbsp;<i>yeah</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Y-You said you wanted to teach me,&rdquo; Cyrus said. He heard the desperation in his own voice and cringed, a distant echo of shame pounding in his ears. He clenched his fists and tried again. &ldquo;You said you would teach me, and I&nbsp;<i>want&nbsp;</i>to learn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look.&rdquo; TJ closed his eyes and inhaled through his noise, like he was trying to keep his temper in check. When he opened them again, Cyrus saw the pity staring back at him and shrank away, embarrassed and ashamed and&nbsp;<i>confused</i>. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute, Cyrus. And I like you. I really do, but&hellip; I&rsquo;ve done my coming out already. I can&rsquo;t go through that again, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re new to this. I get that. And I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re trying to figure yourself out and everything. But I don&rsquo;t wanna be a part of it.&rdquo; He shook his head and sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t teach you how to do this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You need help with paediatrics? I&rsquo;m there. But not with this.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus hunched his shoulders, a flash of anger slicing through the muddle of emotions storming inside his chest. &ldquo;So, what? I&rsquo;m not&nbsp;<i>experienced&nbsp;</i>enough for you? Is that it?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong with you!&rdquo; TJ exclaimed, tearing a hand through his hair. The violent swipe of his fingers ruffled the gel-stiffened waves, fluffing them out and sending locks of hair flopping over his forehead. He looked much better like that, despite everything. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t wanna help you out of the closet, okay? That&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve gotta do by yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; TJ said grimly. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve spent years learning to accept yourself, you&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have no idea what I&rsquo;ve been through,&rdquo; Cyrus said, sniffing back tears.</p><p>TJ cocked his head in agreement. &ldquo;Fair enough. But that doesn&rsquo;t change anything.&rdquo; He flitted his eyes over Cyrus&rsquo; face once more, his breath catching in hesitation, then finally turned around. With his hand on the door, he flicked a parting glance over his shoulder and sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>And just like that, he was gone.</p><p>~~ ~~~</p><p>&ldquo;What an ass,&rdquo; Buffy said, crushing an empty can of soda in her fist with one squeeze. Outside, the rain was screaming and whirling like an angry spirit, and the three of them were waiting it out in the cafeteria. &ldquo;Do you want me to talk to him? Beat him up for you?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus snorted. &ldquo;Thanks, Buffy&hellip; But, no. I just wanna forget about him altogether.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem really upset,&rdquo; Andi said softly.</p><p>&ldquo;I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You really liked him, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged in frustration. Not at Andi, but at himself. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I let myself fall for someone like TJ Kippen. I mean, he probably flirts with anything that moves! I should&rsquo;ve known better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; Buffy assured him. &ldquo;He led you on, Cyrus. We all saw it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I thought he actually liked me. It&nbsp;<i>felt&nbsp;</i>like he did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He manipulated you.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi frowned. &ldquo;Not necessarily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Buffy said, her eyebrows lifting incredulously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been flirting with Cyrus for weeks, and the moment he had him where he wanted him, he changed his mind. It was all just a game!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to come out,&rdquo; Andi shot back, making Buffy flinch in surprise. &ldquo;When Amber asked me out, I was a mess. I&rsquo;d never been with another girl before. And if it hadn&rsquo;t been for her patience and understanding &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gross.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&ndash; we probably wouldn&rsquo;t be together right now. But it isn&rsquo;t so easy for everyone.&rdquo; She turned away from Buffy and took Cyrus&rsquo; hand, sweeping a comforting thumb over his knuckles. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how difficult it was for TJ to come out. It might not be something he wants to revisit, and you asking him to walk you through the basics of being gay isn&rsquo;t gonna help that.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus balked. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t what I wanted! I just&hellip; I wanted to learn from him because I&nbsp;<i>like&nbsp;</i>him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Andi said. &ldquo;You wanted him to teach you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be honest with yourself, Cy. Try and see things from TJ&rsquo;s point of view.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus thought back to their conversation in the locker room, how quickly TJ&rsquo;s softness had hardened into rejection the moment he&rsquo;d realised how inexperienced Cyrus was, the distance in his eyes when he&rsquo;d turned him down&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t want to be Cyrus&rsquo; teacher. That much was obvious. But what if the rest of it had been real? What if Cyrus really&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>the one in the wrong here?</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, the blood draining from his face as realisation dawned on him. &ldquo;He thought I was using him.&rdquo;</p><p>Andi smiled knowingly. &ldquo;And you thought&nbsp;<i>he&nbsp;</i>was using&nbsp;<i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was just a misunderstanding!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hang on a second,&rdquo; Buffy interrupted, wagging a finger in the air as she struggled to catch up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus thought TJ rejected him because he was inexperienced,&rdquo; Andi explained in a slow, patronising tone of voice. She was clearly enjoying being ahead of Buffy for once. &ldquo;But TJ actually rejected him because he thought Cyrus was using him to&nbsp;<i>gain&nbsp;</i>experience. Do you get it now?&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy folded her arms and grumbled. &ldquo;I suppose&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; Cyrus said, his mind still buzzing with a thousand fleeting thoughts, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t need to turn me down so abruptly. I mean, he didn&rsquo;t even let me explain!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe he was upset?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So was I!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus.&rdquo; Andi squeezed his hand and smiled. &ldquo;You like him, don&rsquo;t you? You said it yourself. And he likes you. I&nbsp;<i>know&nbsp;</i>he does. So why are you trying so hard to talk yourself out of this?&rdquo; She scooted closer across the bench and rested her head on his shoulder. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let a stupid misunderstanding ruin this for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus stared down at his hands, a trembling bundle in his lap, and exhaled a shaky breath. &ldquo;What if you&rsquo;re wrong?&rdquo; he asked, the roaring of the rain outside almost swallowing his words. &ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t like me because he thinks I&rsquo;m na&iuml;ve?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then he&nbsp;<i>would&nbsp;</i>be an ass,&rdquo; Andi said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy groaned. &ldquo;I hate to admit, but I think she&rsquo;s right&hellip; I&rsquo;ve seen the way he looks at you. There&rsquo;s no faking that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been with a guy before,&rdquo; Cyrus whimpered, stating what they both already knew. &ldquo;What if I&rsquo;m bad at it? What if I&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>need someone to teach me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gay,&rdquo; Buffy said simply. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need someone to teach you what you already know.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Cyrus could protest any further, one of the doors leading outside opened with a heavy&nbsp;<i>thump</i>, and TJ came stumbling into the cafeteria, thoroughly soaked to the bone. There was water streaming down his face, a sheet of dark blond hair covering his eyes, and his scrubs were completely sodden. Cyrus could do nothing but watch in stunned silence as the fellow shook himself out like a large dog and blindly collapsed into a nearby chair. It was only when he swept the hair out of his eyes that he noticed Cyrus watching him.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I, um&hellip; I&rsquo;ll go somewhere else &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why were you outside?&rdquo; Buffy asked him, her expression flitting between amused and repulsed. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s pouring it down, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very smart for a fellow, are you?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ gave her a tight, acidic smile. &ldquo;I know you haven&rsquo;t been here long, intern, but not every ward in this hospital is conveniently connected by corridors.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy simply glowered in response.</p><p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, guys,&rdquo; Andi said, smiling nervously as she attempted to smooth things over. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all adults, aren&rsquo;t we? I&rsquo;m sure we can sit here without arguing until the rain stops.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m gonna go.&rdquo; TJ scraped back his chair and got to his feet, the soles of his shoes squeaking against the wet floor. For a brief moment, his eyes landed on Cyrus, but they quickly danced away and returned to the rain lashing against the windows instead. &ldquo;Wish me luck, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus was standing before he&rsquo;d even decided to follow him.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I need to talk to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, the rain &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A little water&rsquo;s not gonna hurt me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But losing TJ will.&rdquo;</p><p>Buffy gagged. &ldquo;Okay, I know you&rsquo;re in love and everything, but there was no need for that level of cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her,&rdquo; Andi said, beaming as she reached out and squeezed Cyrus&rsquo; hand. &ldquo;Go get him, Cy!&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as he opened the door, the rain hit him like a thousand flecks of ice, instantly raising the hair on his arms and turning his cheeks a deep, stinging shade of pink. But there was no going back now. He could see TJ&rsquo;s retreating form just ahead, quickly fading in the grey smudge of rain sweeping across his vision. If he didn&rsquo;t move now, he would lose him, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d be able find the courage to confront him like this again.</p><p>So he ran.</p><p>&ldquo;TJ!&rdquo; The wind picked up his words and tossed them into the sky, becoming one with the rain and sinking into the wet earth beneath his feet. &ldquo;TJ, wait!&rdquo;</p><p>With his nose buried in the crook of his arm to shield his face from the storm, he chased after the distant speck of white with all the energy he could muster. By the time his hand latched onto the soggy tail of TJ&rsquo;s coat, his legs were burning, despite the rain leeching through his scrubs, and he could barely breathe enough air into his lungs to spit out a single word. But, luckily, TJ didn&rsquo;t shove him away like he&rsquo;d expected him to. He stood there, quiet and grim, as Cyrus caught his breath, seemingly indifferent to the darkening clouds above their heads, and waited.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I need&hellip; I need to talk to you.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ looked away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only making this harder, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t I understand?&rdquo; he asked, spraying Cyrus with droplets of rain as he whipped around to face him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re new to the whole coming out thing. You wanna have some fun, figure yourself out&hellip; I get it. But I&rsquo;m not interested in playing a one-time part in your journey to self-discovery. I want something that&rsquo;s gonna last, okay? A relationship that&nbsp;<i>means&nbsp;</i>something, for once. And you&rsquo;re obviously not looking for that kind of thing, so &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what I&rsquo;m looking for!&rdquo; Cyrus yelled. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;m inexperienced, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m ignorant. I&rsquo;ve known what I want for a very long time. And for some bizarre reason,&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;happen to be it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cyrus &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I fell in love with one of my best friends when I was thirteen. I&rsquo;ve known I was gay for almost half my life. So don&rsquo;t you&nbsp;<i>dare&nbsp;</i>stand there and accuse me of not understanding the struggles of learning to accept yourself, because&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;</i>lived it too! And just because I&rsquo;ve never been with another guy before, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not sure of who I am, or what I want!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And maybe you don&rsquo;t want the responsibility of being my first boyfriend. Maybe you&rsquo;re scared it will be awkward and difficult and too much work.&nbsp;<i>I understand that</i>. But that doesn&rsquo;t give you the right to jump to conclusions and ignore me!&rdquo;</p><p>At this point, TJ was smirking, and Cyrus could feel his anger rising and rising, like a pot of water close to boiling over.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you done yet?&rdquo; the fellow asked, taking a step towards him.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyrus shoved him away and growled. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not done yet! Do you have any idea what you&rsquo;ve done to me? I&rsquo;ve spent nearly thirteen years hiding from who I really am,&nbsp;<i>terrified&nbsp;</i>of getting hurt all over again. I&rsquo;ve been hiding for so long that I forgot what it felt like to be&nbsp;<i>me</i>.&rdquo; He shook his head, half-choking on a sob. &ldquo;And then you kissed me, and I felt like I&nbsp;<i>existed&nbsp;</i>again.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ stopped smirking.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what this means to you. I don&rsquo;t know if you like flirting with me, and that&rsquo;s it, or if you actually wanna be with me. Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter&hellip; I was a goner the moment you winked at me.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. It felt good to be honest. It felt like the rain - &nbsp;crazy and reckless and&nbsp;<i>real</i>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;m inexperienced. And awkward. And I tend to say the wrong things at the wrong times.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m also nice. And loyal. And my friends think I&rsquo;m a catch. So if you still wanna turn me down, that&rsquo;s fine. But if you decide to give this a chance, you won&rsquo;t regret it, because &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of his words were swallowed by a kiss.</p><p>Cyrus made a little squawk of surprise as TJ&rsquo;s lips melted against his own, all of his pent up frustration seeping out of him within seconds, leaving him weightless and airy, elastic and free&hellip; He clutched onto TJ&rsquo;s shoulders and whimpered slightly, losing himself to the melodic&nbsp;<i>whoosh&nbsp;</i>of the rain as TJ pulled him impossibly closer.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you liked me,&rdquo; he mumbled between kisses, gently tucking the hair behind Cyrus&rsquo; ears. &ldquo;I thought&hellip; I thought &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; He cupped TJ&rsquo;s face and pressed their foreheads together, breathing him in. &ldquo;You have nothing to apologise for. I&rsquo;m the idiot who made you think you were nothing more than a&nbsp;<i>practice&nbsp;</i>boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus froze, his face flushing darkly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you tell me you didn&rsquo;t mean to call me your boyfriend, I&rsquo;m gonna be really upset.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you&hellip; You&nbsp;<i>want&nbsp;</i>me to call you that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It has a nice ring to it, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; TJ tilted his head to the side, revealing the wicked slice of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;Like you said, I&rsquo;ve been flirting with you for a while now. And&nbsp;<i>this&nbsp;</i>is what usually comes after the flirting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;this exactly?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ shrugged, the confidence&nbsp;in his smile not quite reaching his eyes. &ldquo;Me asking you out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&nbsp;<i>yeah</i>. Unless you don&rsquo;t &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just chased you through a storm in nothing but scrubs and poured out my heart to you like we&rsquo;re in a Hallmark movie, and you honestly don&rsquo;t think I wanna be your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Um &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such an idiot,&rdquo; he laughed, palming the back of TJ&rsquo;s neck and kissing him softly. All around them, the sky shivered and wept, bathing them in tears of joy as they clung onto each other for dear life,&nbsp;laughing and hugging and basking in the rain.&nbsp;</p><p>~~~~~</p><p>Cyrus tugged the fleece blanket over his shoulders and tucked it under his chin, shuddering with relief as the heat pulsing from the radiator slowly filled the on-call room. He could still feel the occasional drop of rain rolling down his spine, but at least he could also feel his toes again. And the hot cocoa TJ had placed in his hands a few minutes ago was quickly thawing his icy palms as well.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; his said, lips trembling as he took a tentative sip from the steaming cup. The burn was delicious.</p><p>TJ wrapped an arm around his shoulders and pulled him closer, until he was practically sitting on his lap. Despite being equally soaked, TJ seemed to radiate warmth at all times, and Cyrus couldn&rsquo;t resist snuggling against his boyfriend&rsquo;s &ndash; yes,&nbsp;<i>boyfriend&rsquo;s&nbsp;</i>&ndash; chest. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You smell like rain,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p><p>&ldquo;So do you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s quite nice, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>He closed his eyes, ear pressed against the steady beating of TJ&rsquo;s heart. The sudden shift from freezing to cosy was taking its toll, making him feel sluggish and loose-lipped. He had no idea what he was going to say until the words tumbled out of his mouth.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you only kiss me to shut me up?&rdquo;</p><p>TJ chuckled. &ldquo;How could I&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;kiss you when you were being so damn cute?&rdquo; He threaded his fingers through Cyrus&rsquo; hair, gently undoing all the frazzled knots left behind by the rain. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sorry for interrupting your Hallmark speech. What else were you gonna say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was more or less done,&rdquo; Cyrus admitted. &ldquo;I was just gonna reassure you that you wouldn&rsquo;t have to go through the drama of coming out all over again.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ sighed, shifting on the bed so Cyrus was laying across his legs, looking up at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for everything I said the other day,&rdquo; he said quietly, his fingers resuming their careful exploration of Cyrus&rsquo; hair. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t wanna be involved in another shame spiral, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not spiralling,&rdquo; Cyrus told him. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m definitely not ashamed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay if you are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; He reached up and touched TJ&rsquo;s face, tracing the fine bones beneath his lightly-stubbled cheeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>TJ grinned. &ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re a sap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Definitely not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, because I&rsquo;m just getting started&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>When their lips were mere inches apart, TJ&rsquo;s pager started buzzing at his hip, and Cyrus was caught between laughter and tears as he moved off the fellow&rsquo;s lap so he could check it. All he wanted to do was stay in this tiny room, with the lights low and the rain pattering against the window, and kiss his boyfriend. But when there were little kids with scraped knees and poorly tummies waiting for his assistance,&nbsp;Cyrus didn&rsquo;t mind letting him go. This was the life they&rsquo;d both chosen for themselves, after all.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; TJ huffed, already half-standing. &ldquo;Duty calls.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus gave him a sleepy smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You gonna stay here and rest for a while?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>The next thing he knew, TJ was gently prying the half-empty cup from his hands and lowering his head onto a pillow. Cyrus could hear the smile in his voice as he leaned over and kissed the sensitive spot behind his ear, whispering goodbye.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come find you later, okay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s being a sap?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; TJ said simply, planting one last kiss on Cyrus&rsquo; forehead as he got to his feet. &nbsp;</p><p>Before he could leave, Cyrus grabbed onto his elbow and ushered him closer. TJ obliged with a fond little smile, crouching down beside the bed, and allowed Cyrus to kiss him on the lips once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you too,&rdquo; Cyrus murmured softly, bumping their noses together.</p><p>After a few more parting kisses (with Cyrus promising each one would be the last) TJ managed to escape the on-call room, pausing briefly in the doorway to wave Cyrus goodbye and mockingly blow him a kiss. Joke or not, Cyrus still pretended to catch it mid-air and press it against his mouth, to which TJ blushed like a schoolboy and walked backwards into the wall, before stammering a final goodbye and disappearing down the corridor. Cyrus stared at the spot where the fellow had once stood until his eyelids began to droop closed. &nbsp;</p><p>He&rsquo;d barely been asleep for five minutes when the door slammed open again, no doubt leaving a mark where it collided with the wall. His eyes sprang open as he sat bolt upright, only to find Buffy and Andi standing in the middle of the room, pointing at him accusingly with their mouths gaping open.</p><p>&ldquo;You both look ridiculous,&rdquo; he said, collapsing back against his pillow.</p><p>&ldquo;We saw you kissing TJ in the rain!&rdquo; Buffy exclaimed.</p><p>Andi nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Yes! We saw you through the window!&nbsp;<i>Cyrus&nbsp;</i>&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, okay&hellip; We kissed. What&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking for you everywhere!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s TJ?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or should we say, where&rsquo;s your&nbsp;<i>boyfriend</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus shrugged. &ldquo;Well, considering TJ and I are dating now, I guess you&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>say that.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once, Buffy and Andi were crowded around him, jumping on the bed and shaking his arms as they bombarded him with a thousand overlapping questions. He didn&rsquo;t say a word, just sat there and soaked in the attention with a smug little smile, his thoughts slipping back to TJ. The dirty-blond in the dark blue scrubs. The paediatrics fellow.&nbsp;<i>His boyfriend</i>.</p><p>And for the first time in almost thirteen years, he actually felt like himself again.</p><p><i>The End.</i></p><p><i>~~~~~</i></p><p><i>Thank you again for your patience, <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m6bUlRhshKvuSxiEWBPW-yw\">@tyrusflavoredtea</a>.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p><i>If you enjoy the fic, please like/comment/reblog! All forms of feedback mean the world to me &hearts;<br /></i></p>\n<p><i>\n\nP.S. You don&rsquo;t need to watch Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy to read this fic.&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p><i>~~~~~</i></p>\n<p>It was barely six in the morning when Cyrus shuffled into The Pit, one hand wrapped around a&nbsp;paper cup of coffee while the other sluggishly patted his pillow-mussed hair into shape. The sun was still making its slow ascent into the sky, spilling its morning glow across the ambulance bay outside, but Shadyside Hospital was already alive with people &ndash; patients and practitioners alike. As always, the air was buzzing with a frantic, suspenseful energy, but Cyrus had a feeling that today&rsquo;s shift was going to be even crazier than usual.</p>\n<p>As soon as he spotted Andi and Buffy standing next to a row of gurneys&nbsp;on the side of the room, Cyrus downed the last of his coffee, dumped his cup in the nearest bin, and dragged himself across The Pit to join them. His presence was met with a couple of weary nods.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Morning, Cy,&rdquo; Andi greeted him, blinking her tired eyes open as she attempted a small smile. &ldquo;Sleep well?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus groaned. &ldquo;Too well&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t wanna leave my bed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I never do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You two are depressing,&rdquo; Buffy said with the quirk of an eyebrow. Despite the dark smudges beneath her eyes, she seemed relatively well-rested, and Cyrus envied her for it. &ldquo;Whose service are you on today?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No clue,&rdquo; Cyrus said. He stifled a yawn with the back of his hand and shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably be stuck in the clinic again, knowing my luck.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The clinic isn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>bad.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grunt work, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Buffy opened her mouth to protest, then changed her mind, probably deciding it was too early in the morning for a debate. &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re right. It isn&rsquo;t great in there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never worked a&nbsp;<i>day</i>&nbsp;in the clinic,&rdquo; Andi said, shooting Buffy a teasing glare. &ldquo;The residents probably fight over you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault everyone wants me on their service.&rdquo; Buffy cracked her knuckles and grinned, playfully rolling her eyes at Andi&rsquo;s unimpressed expression. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t look at me like that&hellip; You&rsquo;re the one&nbsp;<i>dating&nbsp;</i>a resident.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Andi folded her arms defensively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never asked Amber to do me any favours.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you have. But if anyone&rsquo;s got an advantage here, it&rsquo;s definitely you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please stop bickering,&rdquo; Cyrus pleaded, gingerly rubbing his temples to ease the pounding in his head. The bright lights of The Pit never failed to give him a headache, especially when he was still in the process of waking up. &ldquo;I would give anything to be put on radiology today,&rdquo; he continued groggily. &ldquo;Somewhere dark and quiet, where I could nap in peace&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Buffy punched him in the shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a surgical intern,&rdquo; she said, as if he needed reminding. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to&nbsp;<i>nap</i>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. Sleep is a thing of the past for people like us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so dramatic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, flapping his arms like a bird caught in a net. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<i>tired</i>. And when I&rsquo;m tired, I get cranky. And when I&rsquo;m cranky, I get dramatic. It&rsquo;s a vicious circle!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you better reel it in,&rdquo; Buffy said, dropping her voice to an urgent whisper. &ldquo;Dr. Metcalf&rsquo;s coming over.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Within seconds, the Chief of Surgery was looming over them, wearing his signature frown as he carefully surveyed the interns with a pair of sharp, judgemental eyes. After a few moments of tense silence, the older man wrinkled his nose and leaned back.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you three have someplace to be?&rdquo; he asked, phrasing the question like a warning.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Metcalf,&rdquo; Andi and Buffy squeaked in unison, their eyes as wide as dinner plates. When Cyrus didn&rsquo;t say a word, they both turned to him with questioning looks of horror.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t actually know whose service I&rsquo;m on today,&rdquo; he hurried to explain, his voice trembling slightly.</p>\n<p>Dr. Metcalf sighed. &ldquo;The incompetency of you interns is astonishing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologise. Just get to work!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But &ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Go with the first resident you see for today. But don&rsquo;t let this kind of amateur mistake happen again. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cyrus gulped. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As soon as Dr. Metcalf walked away, Cyrus allowed himself to breathe again, his wobbly legs giving way as he slumped against Buffy&rsquo;s side for support.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think I just peed myself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Andi snorted. &ldquo;Are you okay, Cy?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Just traumatised. Nothing major.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There you go again with the dramatics,&rdquo; Buffy said, shoving him off with a shrug. As she was pressing the crinkles out of her scrubs, her eyes landed on something across the room, and a devious smirk appeared on her lips. &ldquo;Well, I guess that answers the question of whose service you&rsquo;re on today.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before Cyrus could ask any questions, Buffy grabbed his chin and turned his head to the right, pointing his gaze towards a dirty-blond man in dark blue scrubs standing at the opposite end of The Pit, his green eyes scrolling up and down the tablet in his hands.</p>\n<p><i>TJ Kippen</i>. Or, as Buffy and Andi liked to call him,&nbsp;<i>Cyrus&rsquo; big fat crush</i>.</p>\n</p>",
