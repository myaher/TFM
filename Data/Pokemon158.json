The x2 Fire Weakness was a mixed bag depending on when it was played. Reshiram was a nuisance, especially earlier in the HGSS-On format. Then the Fire-type was mostly in lower-tier decks, but you did have things like Pyroar and Charizard EX popping up in the NXD-On (Next Destinies) and BCR-On (Boundaries Crossed) formats. The somewhat rare Flareon was also annoying in these later formats as well. The -20 Water Resistance was nice with the early Kingdra, Vanilluxe, and Kyurem and the later Blastoise, Kyurem (Plasma Freeze), Empoleon, and Seismitoad EX. 20 wasn\u2019t a lot, but it could make a difference on something with constant healing.

You healed 10 damage from each of your Pokemon between turns. The obvious play, especially in earlier formats, was to pair this with Reuniclus, use Reuniclus to spread damage taken among your Pokemon, and heal a bunch of it away at once. Running both stage 2 Pokemon could be a bit clunky, especially for a fast time in the game, but it could take quite a bit of abuse if it all set up.</p><p>Serperior tried to be an attacker with Leaf Tornado. 60 damage for a Grass and a Colorless Energy wasn\u2019t terrible but also wasn\u2019t spectacular. You could move Grass Energy around your Pokemon as you wanted when using the attack, which could make for some cool plays if you were running this with other Grass-types like Virizion (or, much later on, Virizion EX or something), but it was mostly limited to that scenario.</p><p>Serperior was just a bit too slow to seriously compete with good decks when it was available. It did make for an interesting idea for a fun deck that tried to tank for a while, but tanking just wasn\u2019t that good until really late in Serperior\u2019s run as a legal card and other Pokemon just did it better by then. It was a nice attempt that would have been awesome in quite a few other eras of the game to be sure. It was stuck in fun decks in reality.<br/></p>",

You could move Grass Energy around your Pokemon as you wanted when using the attack, which could make for some cool plays if you were running this with other Grass-types like Virizion (or, much later on, Virizion EX or something), but it was mostly limited to that scenario.</p><p>Serperior was just a bit too slow to seriously compete with good decks when it was available. It did make for an interesting idea for a fun deck that tried to tank for a while, but tanking just wasn\u2019t that good until really late in Serperior\u2019s run as a legal card and other Pokemon just did it better by then. It was a nice attempt that would have been awesome in quite a few other eras of the game to be sure. It was stuck in fun decks in reality.<br></p></p>",
                "content": "<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e8ddd07614bf1ef3a16192054d737e6/tumblr_inline_pk3io3XgKh1sm9dm4_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Note: This image is of the Dragons Exalted print of the card, but the 4 prints available over the years played the same.</p><p>Serperior had a second card in the Black &amp; White set, and this one got a bit of hype before release. It was built very similar to the other one, but its big advantage was that the heal was in Ability form and worked from the Bench. It also worked on Pokemon that weren&rsquo;t Grass-type, meaning that it could work with far more partners. It still had some of the same problems in that the format had a ton of really hard-hitting Pokemon, and this fact did not change as the years went on (and this card, thanks to its reprints, was available for 5 years!), but there was a nice base to try to work with.</p><p>130 HP was pretty typical for a Stage 2 at that point. It was bulky enough to take most hits at least once, though there could be some occasional issues with the strongest of attackers. Formats with the Hypnotoxic Laser/Virbank City Gym combo could cut through Serperior much more easily, though, since that required just 100 damage to pull off when taking Royal Heal into account. The x2 Fire Weakness was a mixed bag depending on when it was played. Reshiram was a nuisance, especially earlier in the HGSS-On format. Then the Fire-type was mostly in lower-tier decks, but you did have things like Pyroar and Charizard EX popping up in the NXD-On (Next Destinies) and BCR-On (Boundaries Crossed) formats. The somewhat rare Flareon was also annoying in these later formats as well. The -20 Water Resistance was nice with the early Kingdra, Vanilluxe, and Kyurem and the later Blastoise, Kyurem (Plasma Freeze), Empoleon, and Seismitoad EX. 20 wasn&rsquo;t a lot, but it could make a difference on something with constant healing. Being able to retreat for just a single Energy was quite nice indeed, especially since Serperior was more of a supporter than an attacker.</p><p>Royal Heal was Serperior&rsquo;s Ability, and the thing that made it interesting in the first place.

Luckily, the nurse had told him that Igneel\nonly needed rest and gave him Igneel\u2019s Pokeball after she was done bandaging\nhim up and giving him the proper treatment, sadly however he didn\u2019t get out\nuntil midnight. When the nurse gave him back Igneel in his Pokeball, he trudged\nback to the fire type dorms, opened the Pokeball to let Igneel out and put him\nto bed, and then crashed into his dorm bed to sleep.</p><p>The next morning Alex laid in bed\nand didn\u2019t feel like getting up. He rolled over to see his little Charmander,\nawake and roaming around the room, chasing after the small mobile when he saw\nit sway slightly and starting out the window intently, as if it didn\u2019t matter\nthat just yesterday the small golden lizard had almost died. He looked at his\nCharmander and noticed the white bandages wrapped around his abdomen and the\ntop of his head, he wondered if Igneel would have scars on his back when he was\nimpaled by Weedle. \u00a0Alex sighed, covered\nhis face with his blankets, and rolled back over, he was the worst trainer\never.</p><p>He totally thought he had gotten\nthis down, but Bethany was right, simulations, which was everything he had been\ndoing for the past two years, weren\u2019t like actual Pok\u00e9mon battles which he\nshould\u2019ve been practicing. He had totally forgotten about terrain, which was a\nhuge part in that battle against Wendell and his Weedle. He had underestimated\nhis opponent, just because he supposedly had a type advantage should not have\nmade it easier for him to win, especially since Wendell and Weedle had tons of\nexperience in battles. But the biggest issue wasn\u2019t the battle itself, it was\nIgneel and Alex. Both had never battled before, Igneel was only three months\nold, heck the Charmander barely knew how to not burn things with his tail yet!\nUghhhh, Alex thought to himself, I\u2019m so stupid! He thought Pokemon battles were\ngoing to be easy, that he could handle it. But maybe he can\u2019t. Maybe he wasn\u2019t\nmeant to do this. He looked up towards the ceiling, maybe his parents were\nright. Maybe he wasn\u2019t fit to be a trainer. Maybe he should go back to his parents\u2019\nhouse and tell them that they were right, and that maybe he should give be a researcher\na chance.

He had underestimated\nhis opponent, just because he supposedly had a type advantage should not have\nmade it easier for him to win, especially since Wendell and Weedle had tons of\nexperience in battles. But the biggest issue wasn&rsquo;t the battle itself, it was\nIgneel and Alex. Both had never battled before, Igneel was only three months\nold, heck the Charmander barely knew how to not burn things with his tail yet!\nUghhhh, Alex thought to himself, I&rsquo;m so stupid! He thought Pokemon battles were\ngoing to be easy, that he could handle it. But maybe he can&rsquo;t. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t\nmeant to do this. He looked up towards the ceiling, maybe his parents were\nright. Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t fit to be a trainer. Maybe he should go back to his parents&rsquo;\nhouse and tell them that they were right, and that maybe he should give be a researcher\na chance. He looked at Igneel who was now looking at him with a concerned look.\nMaybe I should&hellip;</p><p>Before he could finish his\nthoughts, there was a knock on his door. He groaned, it was probably Jose, the custodian,\ntrying to clean his room again. </p><p>&ldquo;No Jose,&rdquo; Alex groaned, &ldquo;My room\nis fine, go away please.&rdquo; </p><p>There was a silence for awhile and\nAlex thought that maybe he was just hearing things. Then he heard a small\nvoice, &ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t know who Jose is. But can I come in?&rdquo;</p>",
