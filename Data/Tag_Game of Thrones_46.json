The exhaustion won and you fell asleep in the surprising comfortable bed.</p><p>All fears went away when you woke up in the same soft furs you had fallen asleep in.</p><p>The brief fear of being stuck in Westeros forever crossed your mind, but the thought of leaving you scared you more. </p><p>The unfamiliar bedroom had a chill to it and the classic North gloom you remember from TV.

Honestly, if anyone were to find you out it&rsquo;d be here. She gave you a dress and took you to Maester Luwin, who of course couldn&rsquo;t aid with your memory loss. Weeks passed, when you had no sign of regaining your memory and there was no word of any house looking for a missing lady, the Starks took you indefinitely.</p><p>Everyday was an adventure for you. Each Stark child kept you entertained in one way or another. You practiced sword fighting with Robb, you attempted archery with Jon, you learned pinpoint with Sansa, you caused trouble with Arya, even played games with Bran and Rickon. </p><p>You loved them all.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why it was so frustrating that you couldn&rsquo;t tell them their fate.</p><p>Everytime you attempted to spoil something of the future the words would die in your throat. An invisible force always stopping you.</p><p>You learned of this when one day you were sitting in a comfortable silence with Jon and you decided to bring up the idea that he wasn&rsquo;t a bastard. A very important factor in his fate. </p><p>\u201cWhat if you weren&rsquo;t a bastard?\u201d Is what you were going to lead with, but all that escaped was cough. You tried again and still remained sputtering. The only thing you successfully did was scare Jon who was patting your back in worriment. </p><p>Even when you tried to curve around the invisible force, it seemed as if the world knew your motives. </p><p>Your second attempt was with Robb when he informed you the King was on his way to Winterfell. </p><p>\u201cYour father mustn&rsquo;t go to capital.\u201d It wasn&rsquo;t a direct statement, but still it never was aired. You were desperate and scared for them. You knew their fate and you didn&rsquo;t want to have experience it, but now you had front row seats to their doom.</p><p>Only then did you wish to go home.</p><p>That&rsquo;s how you ended up standing behind the Stark family as the King arrived. You almost didn&rsquo;t notice everyone bowing when he stepped out, so you quickly copied everyone else.</p><p>\u201cYou got fat.\u201d You heard Robert Baratheon bellow out at Ned, who just gave him a pointed look. It was strange to see what you had already watched several times in person. It gave you a whole new point of view. The whole feeling was surreal. The fact that you weren&rsquo;t limited to just what the camera captured was amazing.</p><p>You glanced around as everyone rised. You saw the upset Cersei watching Robert and Ned walked into the crypts, Jaime in his golden armor dismount his horse, Myrcella and Tommen run off with Arya and Bran, Joffrey whisper something to his mother before briskly walking off, and that&rsquo;s when you eyes landed on him.</p><p>Following Joffrey was no other than the Hound.</p><p>He was tall and intimidating. You then understood why everyone seemed so wary of him, but even so your curiosity remained. You knew he wasn&rsquo;t a villain, by no means was he a hero, but he was a good person. </p><p>As if he could feel eyes on him he turned towards you. You made direct eye contact and it felt like a jolt of electricity went through you. He glowered at you no doubt expecting a fearful expression in return, but you only offered a polite smile in return. You knew what he looked like, so you weren&rsquo;t taken aback by his scarred face. You knew your reaction took him off guard, judging from his confused expression.</p><p>Before anymore looks could be exchanged he continued with his task of following the Prince.</p><p>A hand gripped your arm and dragged you away and inside. </p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d Sansa sang out excitedly.</p><p>\u201cThe Hound?\u201d You replied without stopping to think. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Sansa gave you a horrified look before continuing, \u201cThe Prince! Heavens, he was so handsome! I think we&rsquo;re going to be betrothed.\u201d</p><p>There were a millions things you wanted to tell Sansa, to warn Sansa, but the only one that was deemed appropriate by the forces was, \u201cBe careful.\u201d You sighed. You wanted to tell her, <i>run away Joffrey is a psycho! You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be with that monster. But of course, you couldn&rsquo;t.</i></p><p>\u201cCareful?\u201d She just laughed it off before going off about what beautiful children they&rsquo;d have.</p><p>Luckily, Jon decided to save you.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, would you mind taking a walk with me?\u201d He asked and Sansa seemed to bristle at his presence, quickly excusing herself. Even though no one knew if you were a \u201cLady\u201d or not, everyone in Winterfell always addressed you as such. Of course there were a couple of critics. Some were convinced you were a lying whore that desperate for a better life, other theories believed you were going to kill Ned Stark. </p><p>The Starks ignored them all, putting their trust in you. Although none of those theories were correct, you still felt slightly guilty.</p><p>\u201cI don&rsquo;t mind at all.\u201d You smiled and walked back outside, watching the servants unload the carriages. Jon was probably the person you were closest to here. You never saw him as a bastard and he appreciated the kind treatment. </p><p>\u201cDo you really think they need all that stuff?\u201d Jon asked, breaking the silence and making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d You smiled, but quickly lost it before a thought crossed your mind, \u201cJon, why couldn&rsquo;t you greet the King and Queen with the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it&rsquo;d be rude for a bastard to be present\u2026\u201d He trailed off, his usual moody expression making its appearance.</p><p>\u201cWell, that&rsquo;s bullshit!\u201d You cussed causing the boy next you to loss it with laughter. </p><p>\u201cShould a Lady like you be swearing?\u201d A gruff voice took you and Jon both off guard as you turned and saw the Hound.</p><p>Sandor Clegane, you corrected yourself. He was more than Joffrey&rsquo;s dog. </p><p>\u201cBold to assume I&rsquo;m a Lady.\u201d You chimed back and Sandor met your gaze head on. You made sure there was no fear or judgement in your gaze. </p><p>The realization surprised Sandor.</p><p>He quickly studied you and took in your words. He only knew you were close to the Starks, but other than that he had no idea of who you were. But here you were looking at him like you could see right through him. In all honesty, you terrified him right away.</p><p>The spell was broken once more by Jon, who was set on dragging you away from the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jon asked immediately after being out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d You questioned back, genuinely not taking the hint.</p><p>\u201cThe Hound makes even me want to run away, but you seemed to be undressing him with your eyes!\u201d He said just a little too loudly causing you to hit him and choke on air.</p><p>\u201cI was not!\u201d Your cheeks burned.</p><p>\u201cWas too!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat&rsquo;s with the childish bickering?\u201d Robb walked around the corner and you quickly glared at Jon to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cY/N is lovesick for the Hound.\u201d Jon traitorously told Robb and you hit him again.</p><p>\u201cJon is a liar! And is too embarrassed to admit he can&rsquo;t fall asleep workout fire light!\u201d You hissed back.</p><p>\u201cYou promised not to tell anyone that!\u201d He sputtered, but you only scowled.</p><p>\u201cWell, if your this worked up about it maybe Jon is telling the truth?\u201d Robb began to tease right as Theon approached. Knowing if Theon heard wind of this the whole castle would as well, so quickly you departed, leaving the two boys laughing behind you.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have a crush on Sandor? You didn&rsquo;t know him. Well, maybe you did considering you watched him on TV, but not personally. You never thought he was ugly when watching the show, but you never fangirled over him or anything. Seeing him in person is just overwhelming you told yourself. Even after telling yourself over and over that you didn&rsquo;t have a crush, your heart still didn&rsquo;t slow down. </p><p>You glimpsed the sight of him following Joffrey once more and you couldn&rsquo;t help whisper,</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>PART <a href=\"https://targaryenthot.tumblr.com/post/184031037543/out-of-this-world-iii\">THREE</a></p><p>taglist~ <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjIXO_bhK7fDEYWXMZ5fPww\">@ignoranttruly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1oOA7zKFJ647HI2NxYPlg\">@your-new-mom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGpPOoQQzIC7tGcPXZehcSw\">@buck-me-up-barnes</a> </p>",

You almost didn\u2019t notice everyone bowing when he stepped out, so you quickly copied everyone else.</p><p>\u201cYou got fat.\u201d You heard Robert Baratheon bellow out at Ned, who just gave him a pointed look. It was strange to see what you had already watched several times in person. It gave you a whole new point of view. The whole feeling was surreal. The fact that you weren\u2019t limited to just what the camera captured was amazing.</p><p>You glanced around as everyone rised. You saw the upset Cersei watching Robert and Ned walked into the crypts, Jaime in his golden armor dismount his horse, Myrcella and Tommen run off with Arya and Bran, Joffrey whisper something to his mother before briskly walking off, and that\u2019s when you eyes landed on him.</p><p>Following Joffrey was no other than the Hound.</p><p>He was tall and intimidating. You then understood why everyone seemed so wary of him, but even so your curiosity remained. You knew he wasn\u2019t a villain, by no means was he a hero, but he was a good person. </p><p>As if he could feel eyes on him he turned towards you. You made direct eye contact and it felt like a jolt of electricity went through you. He glowered at you no doubt expecting a fearful expression in return, but you only offered a polite smile in return. You knew what he looked like, so you weren\u2019t taken aback by his scarred face. You knew your reaction took him off guard, judging from his confused expression.</p><p>Before anymore looks could be exchanged he continued with his task of following the Prince.</p><p>A hand gripped your arm and dragged you away and inside. </p><p>\u201cDid you see him?\u201d Sansa sang out excitedly.</p><p>\u201cThe Hound?\u201d You replied without stopping to think. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Sansa gave you a horrified look before continuing, \u201cThe Prince! Heavens, he was so handsome! I think we\u2019re going to be betrothed.\u201d</p><p>There were a millions things you wanted to tell Sansa, to warn Sansa, but the only one that was deemed appropriate by the forces was, \u201cBe careful.\u201d You sighed. You wanted to tell her, <i>run away Joffrey is a psycho! You definitely don\u2019t want to be with that monster. But of course, you couldn\u2019t.</i></p><p>\u201cCareful?\u201d She just laughed it off before going off about what beautiful children they\u2019d have.</p><p>Luckily, Jon decided to save you.</p><p>\u201cLady Y/N, would you mind taking a walk with me?\u201d He asked and Sansa seemed to bristle at his presence, quickly excusing herself. Even though no one knew if you were a \u201cLady\u201d or not, everyone in Winterfell always addressed you as such. Of course there were a couple of critics. Some were convinced you were a lying whore that desperate for a better life, other theories believed you were going to kill Ned Stark. </p><p>The Starks ignored them all, putting their trust in you. Although none of those theories were correct, you still felt slightly guilty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d You smiled and walked back outside, watching the servants unload the carriages. Jon was probably the person you were closest to here. You never saw him as a bastard and he appreciated the kind treatment. </p><p>\u201cDo you really think they need all that stuff?\u201d Jon asked, breaking the silence and making you laugh.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d You smiled, but quickly lost it before a thought crossed your mind, \u201cJon, why couldn\u2019t you greet the King and Queen with the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019d be rude for a bastard to be present\u2026\u201d He trailed off, his usual moody expression making its appearance.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d You cussed causing the boy next you to loss it with laughter. </p><p>\u201cShould a Lady like you be swearing?\u201d A gruff voice took you and Jon both off guard as you turned and saw the Hound.</p><p>Sandor Clegane, you corrected yourself. He was more than Joffrey\u2019s dog. </p><p>\u201cBold to assume I\u2019m a Lady.\u201d You chimed back and Sandor met your gaze head on. You made sure there was no fear or judgement in your gaze. </p><p>The realization surprised Sandor.</p><p>He quickly studied you and took in your words. He only knew you were close to the Starks, but other than that he had no idea of who you were. But here you were looking at him like you could see right through him. In all honesty, you terrified him right away.</p><p>The spell was broken once more by Jon, who was set on dragging you away from the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Jon asked immediately after being out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d You questioned back, genuinely not taking the hint.</p><p>\u201cThe Hound makes even me want to run away, but you seemed to be undressing him with your eyes!\u201d He said just a little too loudly causing you to hit him and choke on air.</p><p>\u201cI was not!\u201d Your cheeks burned.</p><p>\u201cWas too!\u201d </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the childish bickering?\u201d Robb walked around the corner and you quickly glared at Jon to keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cY/N is lovesick for the Hound.\u201d Jon traitorously told Robb and you hit him again.</p><p>\u201cJon is a liar! And is too embarrassed to admit he can\u2019t fall asleep workout fire light!\u201d You hissed back.</p><p>\u201cYou promised not to tell anyone that!\u201d He sputtered, but you only scowled.</p><p>\u201cWell, if your this worked up about it maybe Jon is telling the truth?\u201d Robb began to tease right as Theon approached. Knowing if Theon heard wind of this the whole castle would as well, so quickly you departed, leaving the two boys laughing behind you.</p><p>You didn\u2019t have a crush on Sandor? You didn\u2019t know him. Well, maybe you did considering you watched him on TV, but not personally. You never thought he was ugly when watching the show, but you never fangirled over him or anything. Seeing him in person is just overwhelming you told yourself.

Some were convinced you were a lying whore that desperate for a better life, other theories believed you were going to kill Ned Stark. </p><p>The Starks ignored them all, putting their trust in you. Although none of those theories were correct, you still felt slightly guilty.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind at all.&rdquo; You smiled and walked back outside, watching the servants unload the carriages. Jon was probably the person you were closest to here. You never saw him as a bastard and he appreciated the kind treatment. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think they need all that stuff?&rdquo; Jon asked, breaking the silence and making you laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Definitely not,&rdquo; You smiled, but quickly lost it before a thought crossed your mind, &ldquo;Jon, why couldn&rsquo;t you greet the King and Queen with the others?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;d be rude for a bastard to be present&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, his usual moody expression making its appearance.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s bullshit!&rdquo; You cussed causing the boy next you to loss it with laughter. </p><p>&ldquo;Should a Lady like you be swearing?&rdquo; A gruff voice took you and Jon both off guard as you turned and saw the Hound.</p><p>Sandor Clegane, you corrected yourself. He was more than Joffrey&rsquo;s dog. </p><p>&ldquo;Bold to assume I&rsquo;m a Lady.&rdquo; You chimed back and Sandor met your gaze head on. You made sure there was no fear or judgement in your gaze. </p><p>The realization surprised Sandor.</p><p>He quickly studied you and took in your words. He only knew you were close to the Starks, but other than that he had no idea of who you were. But here you were looking at him like you could see right through him. In all honesty, you terrified him right away.</p><p>The spell was broken once more by Jon, who was set on dragging you away from the man.</p><p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Jon asked immediately after being out of earshot.</p><p>&ldquo;What was what?&rdquo; You questioned back, genuinely not taking the hint.</p><p>&ldquo;The Hound makes even me want to run away, but you seemed to be undressing him with your eyes!&rdquo; He said just a little too loudly causing you to hit him and choke on air.</p><p>&ldquo;I was not!&rdquo; Your cheeks burned.</p><p>&ldquo;Was too!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the childish bickering?&rdquo; Robb walked around the corner and you quickly glared at Jon to keep quiet.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N is lovesick for the Hound.&rdquo; Jon traitorously told Robb and you hit him again.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon is a liar! And is too embarrassed to admit he can&rsquo;t fall asleep workout fire light!&rdquo; You hissed back.</p><p>&ldquo;You promised not to tell anyone that!&rdquo; He sputtered, but you only scowled.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if your this worked up about it maybe Jon is telling the truth?&rdquo; Robb began to tease right as Theon approached. Knowing if Theon heard wind of this the whole castle would as well, so quickly you departed, leaving the two boys laughing behind you.</p><p>You didn&rsquo;t have a crush on Sandor? You didn&rsquo;t know him. Well, maybe you did considering you watched him on TV, but not personally. You never thought he was ugly when watching the show, but you never fangirled over him or anything. Seeing him in person is just overwhelming you told yourself. Even after telling yourself over and over that you didn&rsquo;t have a crush, your heart still didn&rsquo;t slow down. </p><p>You glimpsed the sight of him following Joffrey once more and you couldn&rsquo;t help whisper,</p><p>&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo;</p><p>PART <a href=\"https://targaryenthot.tumblr.com/post/184031037543/out-of-this-world-iii\">THREE</a></p><p>taglist~ <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjIXO_bhK7fDEYWXMZ5fPww\">@ignoranttruly</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mJ1oOA7zKFJ647HI2NxYPlg\">@your-new-mom</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGpPOoQQzIC7tGcPXZehcSw\">@buck-me-up-barnes</a> </p></p>",
