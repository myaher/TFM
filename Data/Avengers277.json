You had been training like this every day for the last month, because the competition you had signed up for was in a few weeks and you\u2019ve already been told by many of your fellow dancers, that this competition would be rough and probably the hardest you had done so far. </p><p>Finding motivation for training like this had been easy. Your boyfriend Peter was always by your side and watched you dancing. He bought you coffee when you needed it and kept encouraging you. Peter tried to find time between his Stark internship and after school activities to visit you and go to the training with you. The two of you were alone there most of the time, so it was okay if you didn\u2019t master every single move.</p><!-- more --><p>You were still laying on the ground, when you heard Peter talking to you.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you okay or do I have to call 911?\u201d Peter said in a tone that was the perfect middle between sarcasm and real worry. You forced yourself to smile and closed your eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think I\u2019m dying. I want you to burn my dead body and let Captain America sing <i>Hallelujah</i> by Jeff Buckley in front of my grave,\u201d you said jokingly, and Peter chuckled. In the next moment, he dropped a dry towel on your face, as well as a water bottle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the Hulk to hold a speech at church for you.\u201d He helped you to sit up and gave you a weak smile. He could see that you were in pain. After a while he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get dressed and I\u2019m going to wait for you outside.\u201d</p><p>You walked into the changing room and opened your locker. There was warm steam coming from the shower, so you assumed that it was the other guy who was training for the competition. He was training in the second room and usually finished later than you did. You didn\u2019t know his name, but you definitely didn\u2019t like him. He had been mean to Peter and you a few times now, so you tried to avoid him by leaving earlier, which didn\u2019t always work out. </p><p>You changed from your sweaty t-shirt to a new one and once you had pulled your jeans above your knees, the other guy stepped out of the shower. Water was dripping from his hair and he grinned when he saw you.</p><p>\u201cYou are still training, even after what I told you last time. You aren\u2019t good enough for this competition. This is something for the good guys, not gays like you,\u201d He teased. You rolled your eyes and stuffed your bag with your old clothes.</p><p>\u201cIgnoring me doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll beat you. That\u2019s what I can say for sure.\u201d You hated him so much. He didn\u2019t know when to shut up. He was just like this one guy Peter had told you about a few times. Flash. The sort of person you hated. Egoistic, mean and probably pretty insecure on the inside was the best way to describe people like him.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d was all you said before leaving.</p><p>You stepped outside into the cold. It felt like the wind was freezing the sweat on your forehead to little ice cubes. You shivered and walked over to Peter, who was already waiting for you.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember this asshole that keeps mocking us?\u201d Peter nodded as a reply. \u201cI just met him while I was changing. He\u2019s still an asshole.\u201d You stuffed your hands in the pockets of your coat. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he says. You\u2019re going to win this thing,\u201d Peter told you. \u201cHe just wants you to give up, because he knows that you\u2019re better than him.\u201d </p><p>You let out a deep sigh. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, but he\u2019s also very good. Have you seen that guy? He\u2019s amazing.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re still the best.\u201d The small clouds that escaped your mouth when you laughed mixed with the air around you. \u201cYou have to say that, because you are my boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>Peter unlocked the door to the flat he shared with his aunt. You dropped your bag in the entrance to his room and dropped on the bed, Peter next to you.</p><p>\u201cEverything hurts,\u201d you voiced your complaint. Peter looked at you from the side.</p><p>\u201cSit up,\u201d he demanded, and you did what he told you without asking. Peter\u2019s hands travelled over your back to massage your sore muscles. He straightened your shoulders to get in between your shoulder blades with his fingers. You sighed in relief when he fixed your hard muscles and wanted to lean into his touch, but Peter told you to sit straight. His hands travelled up and down your spine, causing you to shiver.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d you whispered as soon as he was done. You laid on the bed while Peter got up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d you asked, and Peter turned around on the doorstep.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make some food,\u201d he replied, but you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cNo! Come here and cuddle me!\u201d you shouted at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me laying here alone like a wet bag of sand!\u201d Peter started smiling slightly. He walked towards you and slipped under the covers on his mattress. You did the same and found yourself in your boyfriend\u2019s arms. You cuddled into him and rested your head on his shoulder. He placed a small kiss on your forehead while drawing lines on your back with his fingertips. His warmth calmed you down and allowed you to finally relax. You smiled and closed your eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d you muttered into his shirt after he pulled you closer.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was soft and full of love. The warmth of his body was inviting you to snuggle into him. You buried your face in his shirt and smiled to yourself while closing your eyes. </p><p>\u201cThat guy from dancing probably doesn\u2019t have something like this,\u201d Peter said and you could feel his breath on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d you muttered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want think about sad things right now.\u201d Peter sighed and caressed your hair with his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He kissed your forehead once again.</p><p>\u201cThis is all I need after a day like this,\u201d you admitted, and you felt Peter\u2019s chest vibrating softly when he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too.\u201d You lifted your head off his chest to look him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered before connecting your lips.</p>",

The heat of your heavy breath was just a taste of how exhausted you were and how hard you were trying. </p><p>All your muscles hurt, and you could barely move, but this was the only way to improve your dancing skills. You had been training like this every day for the last month, because the competition you had signed up for was in a few weeks and you\u2019ve already been told by many of your fellow dancers, that this competition would be rough and probably the hardest you had done so far. </p><p>Finding motivation for training like this had been easy. Your boyfriend Peter was always by your side and watched you dancing. He bought you coffee when you needed it and kept encouraging you. Peter tried to find time between his Stark internship and after school activities to visit you and go to the training with you. The two of you were alone there most of the time, so it was okay if you didn\u2019t master every single move.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You were still laying on the ground, when you heard Peter talking to you.</p><p>\u201cY/N? Are you okay or do I have to call 911?\u201d Peter said in a tone that was the perfect middle between sarcasm and real worry. You forced yourself to smile and closed your eyes.</p><p>\u201cPeter, I think I\u2019m dying. I want you to burn my dead body and let Captain America sing <i>Hallelujah</i> by Jeff Buckley in front of my grave,\u201d you said jokingly, and Peter chuckled. In the next moment, he dropped a dry towel on your face, as well as a water bottle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the Hulk to hold a speech at church for you.\u201d He helped you to sit up and gave you a weak smile. He could see that you were in pain. After a while he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get dressed and I\u2019m going to wait for you outside.\u201d</p><p>You walked into the changing room and opened your locker. There was warm steam coming from the shower, so you assumed that it was the other guy who was training for the competition. He was training in the second room and usually finished later than you did. You didn\u2019t know his name, but you definitely didn\u2019t like him. He had been mean to Peter and you a few times now, so you tried to avoid him by leaving earlier, which didn\u2019t always work out. </p><p>You changed from your sweaty t-shirt to a new one and once you had pulled your jeans above your knees, the other guy stepped out of the shower. Water was dripping from his hair and he grinned when he saw you.</p><p>\u201cYou are still training, even after what I told you last time. You aren\u2019t good enough for this competition. This is something for the good guys, not gays like you,\u201d He teased. You rolled your eyes and stuffed your bag with your old clothes.</p><p>\u201cIgnoring me doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll beat you. That\u2019s what I can say for sure.\u201d You hated him so much. He didn\u2019t know when to shut up. He was just like this one guy Peter had told you about a few times. Flash. The sort of person you hated. Egoistic, mean and probably pretty insecure on the inside was the best way to describe people like him.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d was all you said before leaving.</p><p>You stepped outside into the cold. It felt like the wind was freezing the sweat on your forehead to little ice cubes. You shivered and walked over to Peter, who was already waiting for you.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember this asshole that keeps mocking us?\u201d Peter nodded as a reply. \u201cI just met him while I was changing. He\u2019s still an asshole.\u201d You stuffed your hands in the pockets of your coat. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he says. You\u2019re going to win this thing,\u201d Peter told you. \u201cHe just wants you to give up, because he knows that you\u2019re better than him.\u201d </p><p>You let out a deep sigh. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, but he\u2019s also very good. Have you seen that guy? He\u2019s amazing.\u201d </p><p>Peter shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re still the best.\u201d The small clouds that escaped your mouth when you laughed mixed with the air around you. \u201cYou have to say that, because you are my boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>Peter unlocked the door to the flat he shared with his aunt. You dropped your bag in the entrance to his room and dropped on the bed, Peter next to you.</p><p>\u201cEverything hurts,\u201d you voiced your complaint. Peter looked at you from the side.</p><p>\u201cSit up,\u201d he demanded, and you did what he told you without asking. Peter\u2019s hands travelled over your back to massage your sore muscles. He straightened your shoulders to get in between your shoulder blades with his fingers. You sighed in relief when he fixed your hard muscles and wanted to lean into his touch, but Peter told you to sit straight. His hands travelled up and down your spine, causing you to shiver.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Peter,\u201d you whispered as soon as he was done. You laid on the bed while Peter got up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d you asked, and Peter turned around on the doorstep.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make some food,\u201d he replied, but you shook your head.</p><p>\u201cNo! Come here and cuddle me!\u201d you shouted at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me laying here alone like a wet bag of sand!\u201d Peter started smiling slightly. He walked towards you and slipped under the covers on his mattress. You did the same and found yourself in your boyfriend\u2019s arms. You cuddled into him and rested your head on his shoulder. He placed a small kiss on your forehead while drawing lines on your back with his fingertips. His warmth calmed you down and allowed you to finally relax. You smiled and closed your eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect,\u201d you muttered into his shirt after he pulled you closer.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice was soft and full of love. The warmth of his body was inviting you to snuggle into him. You buried your face in his shirt and smiled to yourself while closing your eyes. </p><p>\u201cThat guy from dancing probably doesn\u2019t have something like this,\u201d Peter said and you could feel his breath on your forehead. </p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d you muttered. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want think about sad things right now.\u201d Peter sighed and caressed your hair with his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He kissed your forehead once again.</p><p>\u201cThis is all I need after a day like this,\u201d you admitted, and you felt Peter\u2019s chest vibrating softly when he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too.\u201d You lifted your head off his chest to look him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you whispered before connecting your lips.</p>",

I do not want this penis!\u201d you screamed at Tony. With fire in your eyes, you were fuming, and he backed away, holding up his hands in fear.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would hear that sentence before.\u201d Peter giggled and blushed when he realized he said it outloud, gaining your angry attention.</p><p>Glaring at him, you closed your hands in fists,\u201cShut it Parker. You literally have huge rack right now. You must be in heaven. Me on the other hand, have a fucking penis!\u201d</p><p>Peter gulped, backing away slowly with Tony.</p><!-- more --><p>Tony cleared his throat, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry guys. But I must saw, Y/N you make a very handsome boy, and Peter, you make quite a lovely girl!\u201d trying to make the mood a little lighter but failing miserably as you just continued to glare at the two of them.</p><p>\u201cOh come on Y/N, yeah I know I messed up, but it\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t be mean to him to.\u201d</p><p>You grumbled, realizing he was right, \u201cSorry Pete. You, uh, do make a pretty girl though!\u201d you said grinning at him.</p><p>He pouted, obviously not liking where you were going. \u201cSeriously though Pete, your hair is so nice and long, and golden brown, and my lord, don\u2019t you have the nicest pair of eyebrows I\u2019ve ever seen. And don\u2019t get me started on that ass I saw earlier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut it!\u201d he exclaimed, but grinning at your teasing mood. He turned to Tony, \u201cMr. Stark, please tell me that machine can change us back!\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his head, glancing between your and Peter\u2019s hopeful eyes, and the machine that started this whole gender swap. \u201cUh, yeah. But you need to give me a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays?!\u201d you and Peter both exclaimed in unison, mouths wide open, looking at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cYeah! So shoo\u201d he said, pushing the both of you out of his lap, \u201cI need to get started, so leave, and try not to get in any trouble. I\u2019ll call the school and clear you guys for the week.\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to turn around, \u201cNo! I can\u2019t miss the whole week! Please Mr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t go to school as a girl, can you? Well you could be called Patricia or something.\u201d Tony giggled at his own joke, before closing the door to his lap, leaving you both on the other side.</p><p>Letting out a loud sigh, you glanced at Peter in complete despair, \u201cWhat the fuck are we going to do for a whole week?!\u201d</p><p>*****</p><p>Hours later you found yourself on the couch, with Peter\u2019s legs on your lap, watching a movie. After getting into some looser clothing, you were slightly more comfortable in this body, but Peter was having a really hard time. He kept moving his hair around, because it kept getting in his face. When he huffed, trying to blow a single strand out of his face, you pushed his legs of of you.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete, come here,\u201d you motioned, for him to sit in front of you. \u201cI\u2019ll braid your hair, so it\u2019s out of your face.</p><p>Sitting up right, you positioned yourself, and ran your fingers through his long hair. </p><p>You stopped suddenly when you heard a soft moan come from Peter. He stiffened when he realized that it came from him when he felt the softness of your fingers carding through his hair.</p><p>\u201cPeter. Was that a moan I heard?\u201d </p><p>He chuckled nervously, not making eye contact with yo, \u201cUh. Um, I really like it when people play with my hair and massage my scalp, but no one really does it anymore. Probably because no one really thinks to play with a boy\u2019s short hair.\u201d</p><p>With all seriousness in your voice, \u201cOkay, when we get back into our normal bodies, I\u2019m totally gonna give you daily head rubs. I can\u2019t have my bestie missing out on his desired massages.\u201d</p><p>He gave you a big smile, and relaxed again as you started to braid the hair into two neat french pigtail braids.</p><p>After putting in the ties, securing the two braids, you gave his hair one final check before flashing him an approving grin. Once you attention went back to the screen however, Peter stayed just as close to you.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cPeter. How the fuck do you aim?\u201d you yelled to Peter who was just on the other side of the bathroom door, trying to help you go pee.</p><p>\u201cJust grab it and point how hard is it?\u201d any other day, and Peter would have turned bright red at the conversation he was having, but due to the fact he literally had a set of boobs, he\u2019s gotten past simple bodily functions.</p><p>A few minutes later with more huffing and puffing from you, you walked out the bathroom, your face heated from embarrassment, looking down at the ground not wanting to look at Peter.</p><p>\u201cWas it really that hard Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but i\u2019m just crossing my fingers you get your period within the week.\u201d</p><p>He let out a playful gasp, \u201cAh, how rude! You wouldn\u2019t miss that on your most horrible enemies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right.\u201d you smiled, \u201cNo one should ever endure period cramps, but I know that until Tony fixes us, I\u2019m free from worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m really really hoping it won\u2019t be my \u201ctime of the month,\u201d\u2019 he said, air quoting time of the month, causing you to giggle at his silliness.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d you screamed, brushing your chin and cheeks, feeling the bristles of facial hair growing.</p><p>Peter ran into the bathroom, and looked around wildly, looking for whatever startled you.</p><p>When he looked at you in confusion, you exclaimed, \u201cI have shit growing out of my face.\u201d</p><p>Peter started cackling, the kind where he bended over from laughing to hard, hands on knees, gasping for breath.</p><p>At his reaction, you started to giggle, realizing how odd the situation was. Quickly you joined him, laughing loudly, joining him on the floor. Both still giggling crazily, Tony walked by seeing the two of you on the floor, looking like maniacs.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to ask?\u201d cocking an eyebrow at the sight.</p><p>Barely able to fit words around your laughter you squeezed in, \u201cNope. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>After Tony left, and you and Peter had quieted down, now gasping for breath, he asked you if you knew how to shave your face.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I can do legs for days though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d he said, getting off the floor, and grabbing your arm, pulling you up with him, \u201cI\u2019m gonna help you out.\u201d He looked at him in confusion, so he continued. \u201cI can see you sort of are freaking out about the hair, so I\u2019m going to help you shave.\u201d</p><p>You were hesitant, but really wanting Peter do shave your freaking face, but when he mad you sit on the counter, you just went with it.</p><p>He stood in between you open legs, grabbing the shaving cream that was in the cupboard. Squeezing some onto his hands, he slowly rubbed it onto your face, looking up at you eyes to make sure what he was doing was okay.</p><p>You nodded, gulping slightly, before he grabbed his razor and started to shave. It felt similar to shaving your legs, just a little more sensitive.</p><p>Leaning in closer, you could feel his breath on your skin. His tongue poked out a little with his concentration on making sure he didn\u2019t nick you.</p><p>At his actions, a shiver ran through your body, and before you realized what was happening, you could feel your pants getting tighter around your crotch area.</p><p>Holy fucking shit. I\u2019m getting a fucking boner.</p><p>Shifting your legs slightly you tried to not let notice it, but at your fidgeting, Peter looked at you questioningly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked down when you shifted your legs a little more, and saw what you were so desperately trying to hide. \u201cOh my God. Do you have a boner right now?\u201d</p><p>You looked down embarrassed, but he continued, \u201cHa! I turn you on, thats awesome! Wait, is it because I\u2019m a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I most definitely like boys, I just, just don\u2019t know how to work this \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201d You responded motioning to your junk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boners are awful! When you would wear that red dress of yours it was always so hard to-\u201d Peter abruptly stopped when he realized what he was saying, his cheeks turning bright red in seconds. He cleared his throat and went back to cleaning off the razor.</p><p>\u201cWait, hold on a second Parker. Do you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell not right now. I don\u2019t bat that way if you know what I mean, but uh, yeah.

I do not want this penis!\u201d you screamed at Tony. With fire in your eyes, you were fuming, and he backed away, holding up his hands in fear.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would hear that sentence before.\u201d Peter giggled and blushed when he realized he said it outloud, gaining your angry attention.</p><p>Glaring at him, you closed your hands in fists,\u201cShut it Parker. You literally have huge rack right now. You must be in heaven. Me on the other hand, have a fucking penis!\u201d</p><p>Peter gulped, backing away slowly with Tony.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Tony cleared his throat, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry guys. But I must saw, Y/N you make a very handsome boy, and Peter, you make quite a lovely girl!\u201d trying to make the mood a little lighter but failing miserably as you just continued to glare at the two of them.</p><p>\u201cOh come on Y/N, yeah I know I messed up, but it\u2019s not Peter\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t be mean to him to.\u201d</p><p>You grumbled, realizing he was right, \u201cSorry Pete. You, uh, do make a pretty girl though!\u201d you said grinning at him.</p><p>He pouted, obviously not liking where you were going. \u201cSeriously though Pete, your hair is so nice and long, and golden brown, and my lord, don\u2019t you have the nicest pair of eyebrows I\u2019ve ever seen. And don\u2019t get me started on that ass I saw earlier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut it!\u201d he exclaimed, but grinning at your teasing mood. He turned to Tony, \u201cMr. Stark, please tell me that machine can change us back!\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his head, glancing between your and Peter\u2019s hopeful eyes, and the machine that started this whole gender swap. \u201cUh, yeah. But you need to give me a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays?!\u201d you and Peter both exclaimed in unison, mouths wide open, looking at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cYeah! So shoo\u201d he said, pushing the both of you out of his lap, \u201cI need to get started, so leave, and try not to get in any trouble. I\u2019ll call the school and clear you guys for the week.\u201d</p><p>Peter tried to turn around, \u201cNo! I can\u2019t miss the whole week! Please Mr. Stark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t go to school as a girl, can you? Well you could be called Patricia or something.\u201d Tony giggled at his own joke, before closing the door to his lap, leaving you both on the other side.</p><p>Letting out a loud sigh, you glanced at Peter in complete despair, \u201cWhat the fuck are we going to do for a whole week?!\u201d</p><p>*****</p><p>Hours later you found yourself on the couch, with Peter\u2019s legs on your lap, watching a movie. After getting into some looser clothing, you were slightly more comfortable in this body, but Peter was having a really hard time. He kept moving his hair around, because it kept getting in his face. When he huffed, trying to blow a single strand out of his face, you pushed his legs of of you.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Pete, come here,\u201d you motioned, for him to sit in front of you. \u201cI\u2019ll braid your hair, so it\u2019s out of your face.</p><p>Sitting up right, you positioned yourself, and ran your fingers through his long hair. </p><p>You stopped suddenly when you heard a soft moan come from Peter. He stiffened when he realized that it came from him when he felt the softness of your fingers carding through his hair.</p><p>\u201cPeter. Was that a moan I heard?\u201d </p><p>He chuckled nervously, not making eye contact with yo, \u201cUh. Um, I really like it when people play with my hair and massage my scalp, but no one really does it anymore. Probably because no one really thinks to play with a boy\u2019s short hair.\u201d</p><p>With all seriousness in your voice, \u201cOkay, when we get back into our normal bodies, I\u2019m totally gonna give you daily head rubs. I can\u2019t have my bestie missing out on his desired massages.\u201d</p><p>He gave you a big smile, and relaxed again as you started to braid the hair into two neat french pigtail braids.</p><p>After putting in the ties, securing the two braids, you gave his hair one final check before flashing him an approving grin. Once you attention went back to the screen however, Peter stayed just as close to you.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cPeter. How the fuck do you aim?\u201d you yelled to Peter who was just on the other side of the bathroom door, trying to help you go pee.</p><p>\u201cJust grab it and point how hard is it?\u201d any other day, and Peter would have turned bright red at the conversation he was having, but due to the fact he literally had a set of boobs, he\u2019s gotten past simple bodily functions.</p><p>A few minutes later with more huffing and puffing from you, you walked out the bathroom, your face heated from embarrassment, looking down at the ground not wanting to look at Peter.</p><p>\u201cWas it really that hard Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but i\u2019m just crossing my fingers you get your period within the week.\u201d</p><p>He let out a playful gasp, \u201cAh, how rude! You wouldn\u2019t miss that on your most horrible enemies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right.\u201d you smiled, \u201cNo one should ever endure period cramps, but I know that until Tony fixes us, I\u2019m free from worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m really really hoping it won\u2019t be my \u201ctime of the month,\u201d\u2019 he said, air quoting time of the month, causing you to giggle at his silliness.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d you screamed, brushing your chin and cheeks, feeling the bristles of facial hair growing.</p><p>Peter ran into the bathroom, and looked around wildly, looking for whatever startled you.</p><p>When he looked at you in confusion, you exclaimed, \u201cI have shit growing out of my face.\u201d</p><p>Peter started cackling, the kind where he bended over from laughing to hard, hands on knees, gasping for breath.</p><p>At his reaction, you started to giggle, realizing how odd the situation was. Quickly you joined him, laughing loudly, joining him on the floor. Both still giggling crazily, Tony walked by seeing the two of you on the floor, looking like maniacs.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to ask?\u201d cocking an eyebrow at the sight.</p><p>Barely able to fit words around your laughter you squeezed in, \u201cNope. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>After Tony left, and you and Peter had quieted down, now gasping for breath, he asked you if you knew how to shave your face.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I can do legs for days though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d he said, getting off the floor, and grabbing your arm, pulling you up with him, \u201cI\u2019m gonna help you out.\u201d He looked at him in confusion, so he continued. \u201cI can see you sort of are freaking out about the hair, so I\u2019m going to help you shave.\u201d</p><p>You were hesitant, but really wanting Peter do shave your freaking face, but when he mad you sit on the counter, you just went with it.</p><p>He stood in between you open legs, grabbing the shaving cream that was in the cupboard. Squeezing some onto his hands, he slowly rubbed it onto your face, looking up at you eyes to make sure what he was doing was okay.</p><p>You nodded, gulping slightly, before he grabbed his razor and started to shave. It felt similar to shaving your legs, just a little more sensitive.</p><p>Leaning in closer, you could feel his breath on your skin. His tongue poked out a little with his concentration on making sure he didn\u2019t nick you.</p><p>At his actions, a shiver ran through your body, and before you realized what was happening, you could feel your pants getting tighter around your crotch area.</p><p>Holy fucking shit. I\u2019m getting a fucking boner.</p><p>Shifting your legs slightly you tried to not let notice it, but at your fidgeting, Peter looked at you questioningly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked down when you shifted your legs a little more, and saw what you were so desperately trying to hide. \u201cOh my God. Do you have a boner right now?\u201d</p><p>You looked down embarrassed, but he continued, \u201cHa! I turn you on, thats awesome! Wait, is it because I\u2019m a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I most definitely like boys, I just, just don\u2019t know how to work this \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201d You responded motioning to your junk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boners are awful! When you would wear that red dress of yours it was always so hard to-\u201d Peter abruptly stopped when he realized what he was saying, his cheeks turning bright red in seconds. He cleared his throat and went back to cleaning off the razor.</p><p>\u201cWait, hold on a second Parker. Do you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell not right now. I don\u2019t bat that way if you know what I mean, but uh, yeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>The biggest spin spread on your lips, joy coursing through you at the thought that Peter liked you back. </p><p>\u201cThen Peter Parker, get ready from a big ol\u2019 kiss from me as soon as we get our old bodies back, okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, grinning at what you were saying. \u201cI would love nothing more.\u201d</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cOkay kids, I finally finished fixing the machine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you and Peter exclaimed at the same time.

You were just hoping it would work and not making it any worse. With a blast of light, and what felt like wave after wave of energy blasts hitting you from all angles, you held back a scream at the overwhelming sensory overload.</p><p>Numbness spread over your body, and as soon as you stumbled out of the machine, you grabbed the mirror that Tony was holding towards you.</p><p>You let out a breath at the sight of your normal self.

Probably because no one really thinks to play with a boy\u2019s short hair.\u201d</p><p>With all seriousness in your voice, \u201cOkay, when we get back into our normal bodies, I\u2019m totally gonna give you daily head rubs. I can\u2019t have my bestie missing out on his desired massages.\u201d</p><p>He gave you a big smile, and relaxed again as you started to braid the hair into two neat french pigtail braids.</p><p>After putting in the ties, securing the two braids, you gave his hair one final check before flashing him an approving grin. Once you attention went back to the screen however, Peter stayed just as close to you.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cPeter. How the fuck do you aim?\u201d you yelled to Peter who was just on the other side of the bathroom door, trying to help you go pee.</p><p>\u201cJust grab it and point how hard is it?\u201d any other day, and Peter would have turned bright red at the conversation he was having, but due to the fact he literally had a set of boobs, he\u2019s gotten past simple bodily functions.</p><p>A few minutes later with more huffing and puffing from you, you walked out the bathroom, your face heated from embarrassment, looking down at the ground not wanting to look at Peter.</p><p>\u201cWas it really that hard Y/N.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but i\u2019m just crossing my fingers you get your period within the week.\u201d</p><p>He let out a playful gasp, \u201cAh, how rude! You wouldn\u2019t miss that on your most horrible enemies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah you\u2019re right.\u201d you smiled, \u201cNo one should ever endure period cramps, but I know that until Tony fixes us, I\u2019m free from worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m really really hoping it won\u2019t be my \u201ctime of the month,\u201d\u2019 he said, air quoting time of the month, causing you to giggle at his silliness.</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d you screamed, brushing your chin and cheeks, feeling the bristles of facial hair growing.</p><p>Peter ran into the bathroom, and looked around wildly, looking for whatever startled you.</p><p>When he looked at you in confusion, you exclaimed, \u201cI have shit growing out of my face.\u201d</p><p>Peter started cackling, the kind where he bended over from laughing to hard, hands on knees, gasping for breath.</p><p>At his reaction, you started to giggle, realizing how odd the situation was. Quickly you joined him, laughing loudly, joining him on the floor. Both still giggling crazily, Tony walked by seeing the two of you on the floor, looking like maniacs.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to ask?\u201d cocking an eyebrow at the sight.</p><p>Barely able to fit words around your laughter you squeezed in, \u201cNope. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>After Tony left, and you and Peter had quieted down, now gasping for breath, he asked you if you knew how to shave your face.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I can do legs for days though!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d he said, getting off the floor, and grabbing your arm, pulling you up with him, \u201cI\u2019m gonna help you out.\u201d He looked at him in confusion, so he continued. \u201cI can see you sort of are freaking out about the hair, so I\u2019m going to help you shave.\u201d</p><p>You were hesitant, but really wanting Peter do shave your freaking face, but when he mad you sit on the counter, you just went with it.</p><p>He stood in between you open legs, grabbing the shaving cream that was in the cupboard. Squeezing some onto his hands, he slowly rubbed it onto your face, looking up at you eyes to make sure what he was doing was okay.</p><p>You nodded, gulping slightly, before he grabbed his razor and started to shave. It felt similar to shaving your legs, just a little more sensitive.</p><p>Leaning in closer, you could feel his breath on your skin. His tongue poked out a little with his concentration on making sure he didn\u2019t nick you.</p><p>At his actions, a shiver ran through your body, and before you realized what was happening, you could feel your pants getting tighter around your crotch area.</p><p>Holy fucking shit. I\u2019m getting a fucking boner.</p><p>Shifting your legs slightly you tried to not let notice it, but at your fidgeting, Peter looked at you questioningly. </p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked down when you shifted your legs a little more, and saw what you were so desperately trying to hide. \u201cOh my God. Do you have a boner right now?\u201d</p><p>You looked down embarrassed, but he continued, \u201cHa! I turn you on, thats awesome! Wait, is it because I\u2019m a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I most definitely like boys, I just, just don\u2019t know how to work this \u2018machinery\u2019.\u201d You responded motioning to your junk.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boners are awful! When you would wear that red dress of yours it was always so hard to-\u201d Peter abruptly stopped when he realized what he was saying, his cheeks turning bright red in seconds. He cleared his throat and went back to cleaning off the razor.</p><p>\u201cWait, hold on a second Parker. Do you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell not right now. I don\u2019t bat that way if you know what I mean, but uh, yeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>The biggest spin spread on your lips, joy coursing through you at the thought that Peter liked you back. </p><p>\u201cThen Peter Parker, get ready from a big ol\u2019 kiss from me as soon as we get our old bodies back, okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, grinning at what you were saying. \u201cI would love nothing more.\u201d</p><p>*****</p><p>\u201cOkay kids, I finally finished fixing the machine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you and Peter exclaimed at the same time. While it didn\u2019t take a whole week, it was several days of being a boy for you. And while it was amazing to learn that Peter liked you back during that time, you just wanted your old body back.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this show on the road!\u201d</p><p>You and Peter both stepped into the machine that started this whole mess a couple of days ago. You were just hoping it would work and not making it any worse. With a blast of light, and what felt like wave after wave of energy blasts hitting you from all angles, you held back a scream at the overwhelming sensory overload.</p><p>Numbness spread over your body, and as soon as you stumbled out of the machine, you grabbed the mirror that Tony was holding towards you.</p><p>You let out a breath at the sight of your normal self. Relief washed over you when you saw Peter stumble out as well, in his adorable little male body.</p><p>You both made eye contact, and smiles spread over your faces.</p><p>\u201cWell Y/N, I think you owe me a kiss now.\u201d</p><h2>Permanent Taglist:</h2><p><a href=\"http://leni-lion-luke-larb-logic.tumblr.com\">@leni-lion-luke-larb-logic</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mkeL4kmA9xecH-dfbB7sxwg\">@boysoflapush</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://superwholockian5ever.tumblr.com/\">superwholockian5ever</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://not-reptilian.tumblr.com/\">not-reptilian</a></p><p>@pbandj14 </p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn8vDd5S65Q9bOoYkLl-21Q\">@redstarstan</a></p><p>@winter\u2013cearig</p><p>@<a href=\"http://red-writer13.tumblr.com/\">red-writer13</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mD9CmXGNY1SXgw8qzMPX1pw\">@mundane-cup-noodles</a></p><p><a href=\"http://98-future-is-cake-00.tumblr.com\">@98-future-is-cake-00</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m9zLPpPnAKxdMPYsDJp6iRg\">@sebastian-stan-is-daddy</a></p><p>@<a href=\"http://4narniand4aslan.tumblr.com/\">4narniand4aslan</a></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mR26XJynTi0JdJl79Af8MEA\">@dontpanc</a></p>",

I do not want this penis!&rdquo; you screamed at Tony. With fire in your eyes, you were fuming, and he backed away, holding up his hands in fear.</p><p>&ldquo;I never thought I would hear that sentence before.&rdquo; Peter giggled and blushed when he realized he said it outloud, gaining your angry attention.</p><p>Glaring at him, you closed your hands in fists,&ldquo;Shut it Parker. You literally have huge rack right now. You must be in heaven. Me on the other hand, have a fucking penis!&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gulped, backing away slowly with Tony.</p><p>Tony cleared his throat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry guys. But I must saw, Y/N you make a very handsome boy, and Peter, you make quite a lovely girl!&rdquo; trying to make the mood a little lighter but failing miserably as you just continued to glare at the two of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh come on Y/N, yeah I know I messed up, but it&rsquo;s not Peter&rsquo;s fault. Don&rsquo;t be mean to him to.&rdquo;</p><p>You grumbled, realizing he was right, &ldquo;Sorry Pete. You, uh, do make a pretty girl though!&rdquo; you said grinning at him.</p><p>He pouted, obviously not liking where you were going. &ldquo;Seriously though Pete, your hair is so nice and long, and golden brown, and my lord, don&rsquo;t you have the nicest pair of eyebrows I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And don&rsquo;t get me started on that ass I saw earlier!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh shut it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, but grinning at your teasing mood. He turned to Tony, &ldquo;Mr. Stark, please tell me that machine can change us back!&rdquo;</p><p>He rubbed the back of his head, glancing between your and Peter&rsquo;s hopeful eyes, and the machine that started this whole gender swap. &ldquo;Uh, yeah. But you need to give me a couple days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Days?!&rdquo; you and Peter both exclaimed in unison, mouths wide open, looking at him in shock.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah! So shoo&rdquo; he said, pushing the both of you out of his lap, &ldquo;I need to get started, so leave, and try not to get in any trouble. I&rsquo;ll call the school and clear you guys for the week.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter tried to turn around, &ldquo;No! I can&rsquo;t miss the whole week! Please Mr. Stark!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t go to school as a girl, can you? Well you could be called Patricia or something.&rdquo; Tony giggled at his own joke, before closing the door to his lap, leaving you both on the other side.</p><p>Letting out a loud sigh, you glanced at Peter in complete despair, &ldquo;What the fuck are we going to do for a whole week?!&rdquo;</p><p>*****</p><p>Hours later you found yourself on the couch, with Peter&rsquo;s legs on your lap, watching a movie. After getting into some looser clothing, you were slightly more comfortable in this body, but Peter was having a really hard time. He kept moving his hair around, because it kept getting in his face. When he huffed, trying to blow a single strand out of his face, you pushed his legs of of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay, Pete, come here,&rdquo; you motioned, for him to sit in front of you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll braid your hair, so it&rsquo;s out of your face.</p><p>Sitting up right, you positioned yourself, and ran your fingers through his long hair. </p><p>You stopped suddenly when you heard a soft moan come from Peter. He stiffened when he realized that it came from him when he felt the softness of your fingers carding through his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Peter.
