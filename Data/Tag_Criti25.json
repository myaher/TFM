Beau looked up from the maps that were strewn across the table and frowned at her. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Beau\u2019s dark brown eyes widened and she started scrambling to pack up the maps. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the notes are secure and then come back to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Beau,\u201d the older elf woman said sternly, stepping forward to put her hand on Beau\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake everything and run. As far and as fast as you can. You\u2019re the only one who can keep the location of the city safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m not just going to abandon you to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau, don\u2019t argue. Just go.\u201d</p><p>Beau opened her mouth to continue arguing but Dairon made it clear that there would be no further discussion by walking back out of the tent. Beau cursed under her breath and hurriedly finished packing up the books. She paused when she reached the gold coin on the table, picking it up and rolling it around in her fingers. She could see the delicate carvings under her fingers. A tower on one side with a phrase written in a language that few people still understood how to read and a crowned woman\u2019s face on the other side.</p><p>\u201cBeau!\u201d Someone yelled outside. It wasn\u2019t Dairon, but she couldn\u2019t place the voice right away. \u201cDairon says to go! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck,\u201d Beau hissed and stuffed the coin into her back pocket before running out the back flap of the tent. The sun was low in the sky as evening fell upon them. It would help in her escape but it would make fighting the enemy difficult. She ran up through the small path up the side of the canyon, climbing when it got too steep to walk. She was nearly half way up when she heard sounds of fighting start to rise in the valley. She secured herself to the rock face and then turned around to look down. The sand was kicking up in the chilly night wind and made it hard to tell what was going on. She spat out the sand that got in her mouth and narrowed her eyes, hoping to see how her order was fairing down there.</p><p>There was an explosion of fire that lit up the camp and Beau quickly counted the enemy. Seven- twelve- twenty-two, easily twice the amount of wizards to monks. She cursed again and looked at the rucksack hanging at her side. She looked around the face of the rock hurriedly and spotted a small cave that she hadn\u2019t seen from the ground. As she moved, it became clear that it was almost certainly obscured from view unless you were nearly right up on it. </p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She pulled the bag from her shoulder and stuffed it into the cave, her arm barely fitting inside, then she pushed rocks and sand over and around it so that if anyone did stumble upon the cave, maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice the rucksack anyway.</p><p>She swiftly made her way back down into the valley, ducking behind rocks as she began to hear voices.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the city?\u201d asked a deep, elderly voice, heavy with an accent she recognized. Zemnian, from the north. They were definitely from the Assembly.</p><p>She stepped over the dead body of one of her comrades, Bethany, and swiftly moved behind the main tent. There was movement inside as the wizards tore it apart. Someone answered and her heart sored with hope when she recognized that voice.</p><p>\u201cI will never tell you. You\u2019ll have to kill me, because I will never relent,\u201d Dairon said, her voice nasally like she was having a hard time breathing through her nose. Broken probably. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find it.\u201d She started to laugh and there was a smack as the man who\u2019d spoken smacked her across the face. \u201cDo your worst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, Expositor. I intend to. Tie her up and prepare her for travel to the capital.\u201d</p><p>Beau ducked around the tent and caught sight of the leader. An older man with graying hair and a receding hairline. He had deep set wrinkles and pale skin covered in light brown spots. His eyes though, they were vibrant and cruel and she was certain that she would never forget them for as long as she lived.</p><p>Which, based on what she was planning next, probably wouldn\u2019t be too long at all.</p><p>She launched herself at the man, growling. \u201cDie, you piece of shit!\u201d she exclaimed, sailing towards him through the air.</p><p>She never reached him though. A glowing purple hand snatched her out of the air and slammed her hard into the ground. Her vision went white and, even as it cleared, the scenery around her swam through her sight like fish. </p><p>All she could truly see were the eyes of the man staring down at her. \u201cA little lost lamb has come to say hello? This one of yours, Dairon?\u201d</p><p>Beau followed his eyes and spotted Dairon staring at her, her expression unreadable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>The wizard hummed, clearly not believing her. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind watching her die.\u201d He stood over her and pointed down at her with his finger but Beau didn\u2019t look away from Dairon. The elf\u2019s eyes were sad but her jaw as clenched defiantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Beau whispered, unsure if she was even speaking loud enough for anyone to hear. Dairon nodded slightly, so she must have at least read her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And then she died.</p><!-- more --><p><i>~Three years later~</i></p><p>Caleb groaned quietly as he woke. He usually tried not to make any noise to keep from alerting anyone or anything that might be nearby, but it was the first time in months that he\u2019d slept in a bed, so he couldn&rsquo;t suppress the pleased noise in the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Caleb,\u201d said a voice near his feet. </p><p>He glanced up and spotted his friend and partner in crime, Nott the Brave, sitting near his feet and turning something over in her hand. Her face was turned down apologetically and he instantly felt a cold nugget of dread in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he started, pushing himself up to look at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>She looked ashamed, but not hurt, so that was good. \u201cI\u2026 I lost control last night. I got the itch.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and reached out to put a comforting hand on her shoulder. \u201cAs long as you made it back safely, liebling, that\u2019s all the matters. Did you steal anything?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and shoved the little thing in her fingers back into her pocket. \u201cA few little things. Nothing anybody will miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Shall we go get some breakfast and go over your haul?\u201d</p><p>She brightened up when she realized that he wasn\u2019t cross with her and pushed herself off onto the floor. \u201cYes please!\u201d Caleb smiled slightly and got out of bed, taking a moment to brush off any dirt that had fallen loose from the coat he\u2019d slept in, and then leaning her out into the hallway. She paused in the doorway to pull her mask up over her goblin face and then gleefully followed him down, taking his hand on the stairs.</p><p>They set up at a table near the back, away from the morning crowd stumbling to the bar for coffee and/or hair of the dog. The waitress gave him a tired smile and took their orders before leaving them alone.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and gestured to her. \u201cWould you like to show me what you found?\u201d </p><p>The part where she showed off her prizes was almost as satisfying as the stealing itself. She grinned behind the mask and started pulling things out onto the table. A handful of buttons of various size and shape clattered on the table first. He recognized one as coming from a city guard\u2019s uniform and wanted to ask but decided that he would probably not like the answer. </p><p>\u201cThis one came from a little boy\u2019s backpack,\u201d she said, pointing to a tan one that was bigger than the rest. \u201cHe had curly brown hair and glasses.\u201d She got a far away look in her eye that he didn\u2019t try to interpret. They both had their secrets, it was better for their partnership that they keep them.</p><p>Next, she pulled out a necklace made of shells. It looked professionally made and probably fairly expensive, maybe she would be willing to part with that one so that they could sell it. It was always a gamble about which pieces she was okay with selling and which she wanted to keep. The value of the objects didn\u2019t seem to matter to her at all.</p><p>Lastly, she pulled out a gold coin and he realized that it was what she had been fiddling with earlier. \u201cThis coin looks weird but I thought we could use it to pay for another night here.\u201d She held it out to him and he took it from her appreciatively, looking the coin over. It did, indeed look weird.</p><p>On the front there was a side view portrait of a woman with what seemed to be long, straight hair and a high, regal collar. She was also wearing a three-pronged crown but he couldn\u2019t think of any countries off the top of his head that had female monarchs. Most of the female heads of state that he could remember were elected to their positions. Besides, the coin was old, as old as the Empire itself if he had to wager a guess.</p><p>He turned it over and his heart stopped. There was writing on the back, curled around the edges with a tower stamped in the middle. He didn\u2019t know what it said but he recognized the language on sight.</p><p>This was undercommon in the dialect of the Kryn, a forgotten dialect that was so different from its modern counterpart that there were entire teams of researchers working on translating it to Common. He knew, because he had once been on such a team.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice even to not attract any unwanted attention. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom some lady. Why, is it special?\u201d</p><p>Caleb almost couldn&rsquo;t smother the grin that twitched on his face. He kissed Nott\u2019s head. \u201cThis is very, very special, meine freunde. This could change everything. I need to know where exactly you found it. Who did you take it from?\u201d</p><p>Nott hesitated then and started twisting her fingers nervously. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The labor camp was hot as they walked along the dirt paths through the stacks of marble. There were people toiling sweatily around them, large muscled people with skin that had been darkened under the boiling sun.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you found it? What were doing in this part of town?\u201d</p><p>Nott was perched on his shoulders, holding onto his hair for dear life as the guard leading them through the camp gave her a curious look. \u201cI followed the guard here to steal his button and then I got lost trying to get out. The lady helped me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you stole from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, well- she wasn\u2019t looking!\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed and then cleared his throat and call ahead to the guard. \u201cThis woman, what\u2019s she in for?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to that kind of information, and even if I was I wouldn\u2019t give a fuck. But, when I was told you were coming to see her I asked her that.\u201d</p><p>Caleb waited for him to continue but he didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said \u2018Fuck you, pig\u2019 and then spit on me so I smacked her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned and he and Nott exchanged worried glances. What kind of person were they getting caught up with? But still, Caleb wanted answers, so he continued forward.</p><p>The guards lead them to side of the quarry and Caleb looked up at a lithely muscled woman who was scaling the wall of marble with a rope tied to her belt. The guard pointed up at her. \u201cThat\u2019s Beauregard. She\u2019s the only one who fit your description.\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked at Nott who nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard made it up to the top of the marble and removed the rope of her belt to tie to something up top. \u201cAlright, line\u2019s secured.\u201d she called down. </p><p>\u201cBeauregard!\u201d the guard called up to her. She flipped him off without looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got visitors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Paulie!\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat. \u201cAh, hello! Beauregard?\u201d</p><p>She finally turned to look at him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb glanced at the guard who was swiftly losing interest in them. \u201cMay we speak in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, man, you\u2019re gonna need to speak up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Before he could yell again, the guard elbowed him and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s fucking with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked in confusion before turning back to her. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m coming down!\u201d</p><p>The guard, Paulie apparently, rolled his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s such an asshole.\u201d Then he started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cAh, how do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going far.\u201d He rested against a stack of marble just as Beauregard\u2019s feet hit the ground. She dusted her hands off on her pants and gave him and Nott cautious looks. </p><p>\u201cAlright, the fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard, my name is Caleb Widogast. This is my partner, Nott the Brave. I believe you met last night.\u201d</p><p>Beau met Nott\u2019s eyes and the goblin tensed but she didn\u2019t seem angry. \u201cOh, yeah. You can just call me Beau. What\u2019s up?\u201d Caleb cleared his throat and pulled the gold coin from his pocket, holding it up for her to see. Her eyes widened and she smacked his arm down. \u201cDon\u2019t just pull that out like that, someone could see. Where did you find another one?\u201d</p><p>Caleb hesitated. \u201cThis is yours. Nott\u2026\u201d he let it trail off, hoping the young woman would catch up on her own.</p><p>She did and her eyes widened as she smacked her own ass to check her pockets and finding them empty. \u201cWha- It-\u201d Her eyes narrowed at Nott. \u201cYou.\u201d She took a step forward and Nott cried out in fear as she scrambled across Caleb\u2019s shoulders to put him between her and Beauregard. Instead of chasing her, Beauregard grabbed Caleb\u2019s wrist and tore the coin from his fingers. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re messing with, string bean.\u201d She shoved the coin into her pocket once more.</p><p>He decided to move passed the name calling for now. \u201cA-Actually, I do know. And I think&hellip;\u201d he paused and glance at the guard over his shoulder but he was distracted whipping an inmate. \u201cI think we could help each other locate the city.\u201d</p><p>A smirk slithered across her face. \u201cI already know where the city is. If you want to go with, you\u2019re gonna need to do better than returning my own coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can read the Kryn dialect.\u201d</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes. \u201cComprehend languages doesn\u2019t work on dead languages, Widogast, everyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that, how fucking stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can read it. I can really read it.\u201d Sort of. He could sort of read it. By the time he had left the translation team they hadn\u2019t quite cracked it yet, but he decided to leave that part out.</p><p>That made her pause. She frowned at him but her eyes were hopeful. \u201cOh yeah? Then what does the coin say? The words above the tower, what does it say?\u201d</p><p>He had only recognized one word out of the three, \u2018Night\u2019. He was making a guess that she didn\u2019t know what it said either and he only hoped that he was right because he was fairly certain that she would try to kill him if he got this wrong. \u201cThe Endless Night.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with narrowed eyes for a second and there was no change in her expression. Had she caught onto him? \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to help me break out,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>He let out a sigh and nodded. \u201cOf course. What do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips thoughtfully and nodded towards Paulie subtly. \u201cShake the guard\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan. Shake the guard&rsquo;s hand. You do that and we\u2019re a team.\u201d She started to turn away, but then she paused and glare at Nott. \u201cAnd if I find out you\u2019ve been anywhere near my pockets you\u2019re both on your fucking own.\u201d Then she walked out of sight around a stack of marble.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and adjusted his coat before turning to find the guard. \u201cPaulie, was it?\u201d he asked, stepping up to him as the man wound up his whip.</p><p>Paulie sneered. \u201cJust Paul.\u201d</p><p>Caleb held out his hand, which he suddenly realized was shaking slightly. \u201cThank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Paulie sighed and held the coiled whip under his arm, between his elbow and his ribs, then reached out with his newly free hand to shake Caleb\u2019s. In a flash, the whip was yanked out of his loose hold and there was a crack as Beau uncoiled it in her hand. She whipped it around Paulie\u2019s neck and then wrapped the end around again, pulling with all her strength. Caleb dropped Paulie&rsquo;s hand as he reached up to grasp at the whip, choking for air, but Beau gave no quarter. She held on until Paulie stopped moving and his eyes fell closed.</p><p>She was breathing heavily but smiling as she got back to her feet. \u201cRiot!\u201d she called at the top of her lungs. She grabbed Caleb&rsquo;s arm with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the whip and dragged him swiftly through the quarry.</p><p>\u201cI like her!\u201d Nott called, grinning even as her mask fell down off her face and she held onto Caleb\u2019s coat with all she had. Caleb stumbled but didn\u2019t fall and followed the young woman up into the street as the prisoners rioted behind them.</p>",

Beau looked up from the maps that were strewn across the table and frowned at her. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Beau\u2019s dark brown eyes widened and she started scrambling to pack up the maps. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the notes are secure and then come back to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Beau,\u201d the older elf woman said sternly, stepping forward to put her hand on Beau\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake everything and run. As far and as fast as you can. You\u2019re the only one who can keep the location of the city safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m not just going to abandon you to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau, don\u2019t argue. Just go.\u201d</p><p>Beau opened her mouth to continue arguing but Dairon made it clear that there would be no further discussion by walking back out of the tent. Beau cursed under her breath and hurriedly finished packing up the books. She paused when she reached the gold coin on the table, picking it up and rolling it around in her fingers. She could see the delicate carvings under her fingers. A tower on one side with a phrase written in a language that few people still understood how to read and a crowned woman\u2019s face on the other side.</p><p>\u201cBeau!\u201d Someone yelled outside. It wasn\u2019t Dairon, but she couldn\u2019t place the voice right away. \u201cDairon says to go! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck,\u201d Beau hissed and stuffed the coin into her back pocket before running out the back flap of the tent. The sun was low in the sky as evening fell upon them. It would help in her escape but it would make fighting the enemy difficult. She ran up through the small path up the side of the canyon, climbing when it got too steep to walk. She was nearly half way up when she heard sounds of fighting start to rise in the valley. She secured herself to the rock face and then turned around to look down. The sand was kicking up in the chilly night wind and made it hard to tell what was going on. She spat out the sand that got in her mouth and narrowed her eyes, hoping to see how her order was fairing down there.</p><p>There was an explosion of fire that lit up the camp and Beau quickly counted the enemy. Seven- twelve- twenty-two, easily twice the amount of wizards to monks. She cursed again and looked at the rucksack hanging at her side. She looked around the face of the rock hurriedly and spotted a small cave that she hadn\u2019t seen from the ground. As she moved, it became clear that it was almost certainly obscured from view unless you were nearly right up on it. </p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She pulled the bag from her shoulder and stuffed it into the cave, her arm barely fitting inside, then she pushed rocks and sand over and around it so that if anyone did stumble upon the cave, maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice the rucksack anyway.</p><p>She swiftly made her way back down into the valley, ducking behind rocks as she began to hear voices.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the city?\u201d asked a deep, elderly voice, heavy with an accent she recognized. Zemnian, from the north. They were definitely from the Assembly.</p><p>She stepped over the dead body of one of her comrades, Bethany, and swiftly moved behind the main tent. There was movement inside as the wizards tore it apart. Someone answered and her heart sored with hope when she recognized that voice.</p><p>\u201cI will never tell you. You\u2019ll have to kill me, because I will never relent,\u201d Dairon said, her voice nasally like she was having a hard time breathing through her nose. Broken probably. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find it.\u201d She started to laugh and there was a smack as the man who\u2019d spoken smacked her across the face. \u201cDo your worst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, Expositor. I intend to. Tie her up and prepare her for travel to the capital.\u201d</p><p>Beau ducked around the tent and caught sight of the leader. An older man with graying hair and a receding hairline. He had deep set wrinkles and pale skin covered in light brown spots. His eyes though, they were vibrant and cruel and she was certain that she would never forget them for as long as she lived.</p><p>Which, based on what she was planning next, probably wouldn\u2019t be too long at all.</p><p>She launched herself at the man, growling. \u201cDie, you piece of shit!\u201d she exclaimed, sailing towards him through the air.</p><p>She never reached him though. A glowing purple hand snatched her out of the air and slammed her hard into the ground. Her vision went white and, even as it cleared, the scenery around her swam through her sight like fish. </p><p>All she could truly see were the eyes of the man staring down at her. \u201cA little lost lamb has come to say hello? This one of yours, Dairon?\u201d</p><p>Beau followed his eyes and spotted Dairon staring at her, her expression unreadable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>The wizard hummed, clearly not believing her. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind watching her die.\u201d He stood over her and pointed down at her with his finger but Beau didn\u2019t look away from Dairon. The elf\u2019s eyes were sad but her jaw as clenched defiantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Beau whispered, unsure if she was even speaking loud enough for anyone to hear. Dairon nodded slightly, so she must have at least read her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And then she died.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>~Three years later~</i></p><p>Caleb groaned quietly as he woke. He usually tried not to make any noise to keep from alerting anyone or anything that might be nearby, but it was the first time in months that he\u2019d slept in a bed, so he couldn\u2019t suppress the pleased noise in the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Caleb,\u201d said a voice near his feet. </p><p>He glanced up and spotted his friend and partner in crime, Nott the Brave, sitting near his feet and turning something over in her hand. Her face was turned down apologetically and he instantly felt a cold nugget of dread in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he started, pushing himself up to look at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>She looked ashamed, but not hurt, so that was good. \u201cI\u2026 I lost control last night. I got the itch.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and reached out to put a comforting hand on her shoulder. \u201cAs long as you made it back safely, liebling, that\u2019s all the matters. Did you steal anything?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and shoved the little thing in her fingers back into her pocket. \u201cA few little things. Nothing anybody will miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Shall we go get some breakfast and go over your haul?\u201d</p><p>She brightened up when she realized that he wasn\u2019t cross with her and pushed herself off onto the floor. \u201cYes please!\u201d Caleb smiled slightly and got out of bed, taking a moment to brush off any dirt that had fallen loose from the coat he\u2019d slept in, and then leaning her out into the hallway. She paused in the doorway to pull her mask up over her goblin face and then gleefully followed him down, taking his hand on the stairs.</p><p>They set up at a table near the back, away from the morning crowd stumbling to the bar for coffee and/or hair of the dog. The waitress gave him a tired smile and took their orders before leaving them alone.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and gestured to her. \u201cWould you like to show me what you found?\u201d </p><p>The part where she showed off her prizes was almost as satisfying as the stealing itself. She grinned behind the mask and started pulling things out onto the table. A handful of buttons of various size and shape clattered on the table first. He recognized one as coming from a city guard\u2019s uniform and wanted to ask but decided that he would probably not like the answer. </p><p>\u201cThis one came from a little boy\u2019s backpack,\u201d she said, pointing to a tan one that was bigger than the rest. \u201cHe had curly brown hair and glasses.\u201d She got a far away look in her eye that he didn\u2019t try to interpret. They both had their secrets, it was better for their partnership that they keep them.</p><p>Next, she pulled out a necklace made of shells. It looked professionally made and probably fairly expensive, maybe she would be willing to part with that one so that they could sell it. It was always a gamble about which pieces she was okay with selling and which she wanted to keep. The value of the objects didn\u2019t seem to matter to her at all.</p><p>Lastly, she pulled out a gold coin and he realized that it was what she had been fiddling with earlier. \u201cThis coin looks weird but I thought we could use it to pay for another night here.\u201d She held it out to him and he took it from her appreciatively, looking the coin over. It did, indeed look weird.</p><p>On the front there was a side view portrait of a woman with what seemed to be long, straight hair and a high, regal collar. She was also wearing a three-pronged crown but he couldn\u2019t think of any countries off the top of his head that had female monarchs. Most of the female heads of state that he could remember were elected to their positions. Besides, the coin was old, as old as the Empire itself if he had to wager a guess.</p><p>He turned it over and his heart stopped. There was writing on the back, curled around the edges with a tower stamped in the middle. He didn\u2019t know what it said but he recognized the language on sight.</p><p>This was undercommon in the dialect of the Kryn, a forgotten dialect that was so different from its modern counterpart that there were entire teams of researchers working on translating it to Common. He knew, because he had once been on such a team.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice even to not attract any unwanted attention. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom some lady. Why, is it special?\u201d</p><p>Caleb almost couldn\u2019t smother the grin that twitched on his face. He kissed Nott\u2019s head. \u201cThis is very, very special, meine freunde. This could change everything. I need to know where exactly you found it. Who did you take it from?\u201d</p><p>Nott hesitated then and started twisting her fingers nervously. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The labor camp was hot as they walked along the dirt paths through the stacks of marble. There were people toiling sweatily around them, large muscled people with skin that had been darkened under the boiling sun.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you found it? What were doing in this part of town?\u201d</p><p>Nott was perched on his shoulders, holding onto his hair for dear life as the guard leading them through the camp gave her a curious look. \u201cI followed the guard here to steal his button and then I got lost trying to get out. The lady helped me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you stole from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, well- she wasn\u2019t looking!\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed and then cleared his throat and call ahead to the guard. \u201cThis woman, what\u2019s she in for?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to that kind of information, and even if I was I wouldn\u2019t give a fuck. But, when I was told you were coming to see her I asked her that.\u201d</p><p>Caleb waited for him to continue but he didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said \u2018Fuck you, pig\u2019 and then spit on me so I smacked her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned and he and Nott exchanged worried glances. What kind of person were they getting caught up with? But still, Caleb wanted answers, so he continued forward.</p><p>The guards lead them to side of the quarry and Caleb looked up at a lithely muscled woman who was scaling the wall of marble with a rope tied to her belt. The guard pointed up at her. \u201cThat\u2019s Beauregard. She\u2019s the only one who fit your description.\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked at Nott who nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard made it up to the top of the marble and removed the rope of her belt to tie to something up top. \u201cAlright, line\u2019s secured.\u201d she called down. </p><p>\u201cBeauregard!\u201d the guard called up to her. She flipped him off without looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got visitors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Paulie!\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat. \u201cAh, hello! Beauregard?\u201d</p><p>She finally turned to look at him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb glanced at the guard who was swiftly losing interest in them. \u201cMay we speak in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, man, you\u2019re gonna need to speak up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Before he could yell again, the guard elbowed him and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s fucking with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked in confusion before turning back to her. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m coming down!\u201d</p><p>The guard, Paulie apparently, rolled his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s such an asshole.\u201d Then he started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cAh, how do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going far.\u201d He rested against a stack of marble just as Beauregard\u2019s feet hit the ground. She dusted her hands off on her pants and gave him and Nott cautious looks. </p><p>\u201cAlright, the fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard, my name is Caleb Widogast. This is my partner, Nott the Brave. I believe you met last night.\u201d</p><p>Beau met Nott\u2019s eyes and the goblin tensed but she didn\u2019t seem angry. \u201cOh, yeah. You can just call me Beau. What\u2019s up?\u201d Caleb cleared his throat and pulled the gold coin from his pocket, holding it up for her to see. Her eyes widened and she smacked his arm down. \u201cDon\u2019t just pull that out like that, someone could see. Where did you find another one?\u201d</p><p>Caleb hesitated. \u201cThis is yours. Nott\u2026\u201d he let it trail off, hoping the young woman would catch up on her own.</p><p>She did and her eyes widened as she smacked her own ass to check her pockets and finding them empty. \u201cWha- It-\u201d Her eyes narrowed at Nott. \u201cYou.\u201d She took a step forward and Nott cried out in fear as she scrambled across Caleb\u2019s shoulders to put him between her and Beauregard. Instead of chasing her, Beauregard grabbed Caleb\u2019s wrist and tore the coin from his fingers. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re messing with, string bean.\u201d She shoved the coin into her pocket once more.</p><p>He decided to move passed the name calling for now. \u201cA-Actually, I do know. And I think\u2026\u201d he paused and glance at the guard over his shoulder but he was distracted whipping an inmate. \u201cI think we could help each other locate the city.\u201d</p><p>A smirk slithered across her face. \u201cI already know where the city is. If you want to go with, you\u2019re gonna need to do better than returning my own coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can read the Kryn dialect.\u201d</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes. \u201cComprehend languages doesn\u2019t work on dead languages, Widogast, everyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that, how fucking stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can read it. I can really read it.\u201d Sort of. He could sort of read it. By the time he had left the translation team they hadn\u2019t quite cracked it yet, but he decided to leave that part out.</p><p>That made her pause. She frowned at him but her eyes were hopeful. \u201cOh yeah? Then what does the coin say? The words above the tower, what does it say?\u201d</p><p>He had only recognized one word out of the three, \u2018Night\u2019. He was making a guess that she didn\u2019t know what it said either and he only hoped that he was right because he was fairly certain that she would try to kill him if he got this wrong. \u201cThe Endless Night.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with narrowed eyes for a second and there was no change in her expression. Had she caught onto him? \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to help me break out,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>He let out a sigh and nodded. \u201cOf course. What do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips thoughtfully and nodded towards Paulie subtly. \u201cShake the guard\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan. Shake the guard\u2019s hand. You do that and we\u2019re a team.\u201d She started to turn away, but then she paused and glare at Nott. \u201cAnd if I find out you\u2019ve been anywhere near my pockets you\u2019re both on your fucking own.\u201d Then she walked out of sight around a stack of marble.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and adjusted his coat before turning to find the guard. \u201cPaulie, was it?\u201d he asked, stepping up to him as the man wound up his whip.</p><p>Paulie sneered. \u201cJust Paul.\u201d</p><p>Caleb held out his hand, which he suddenly realized was shaking slightly. \u201cThank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Paulie sighed and held the coiled whip under his arm, between his elbow and his ribs, then reached out with his newly free hand to shake Caleb\u2019s. In a flash, the whip was yanked out of his loose hold and there was a crack as Beau uncoiled it in her hand. She whipped it around Paulie\u2019s neck and then wrapped the end around again, pulling with all her strength. Caleb dropped Paulie\u2019s hand as he reached up to grasp at the whip, choking for air, but Beau gave no quarter. She held on until Paulie stopped moving and his eyes fell closed.</p><p>She was breathing heavily but smiling as she got back to her feet. \u201cRiot!\u201d she called at the top of her lungs. She grabbed Caleb\u2019s arm with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the whip and dragged him swiftly through the quarry.</p><p>\u201cI like her!\u201d Nott called, grinning even as her mask fell down off her face and she held onto Caleb\u2019s coat with all she had. Caleb stumbled but didn\u2019t fall and followed the young woman up into the street as the prisoners rioted behind them.</p></p>",

Beau looked up from the maps that were strewn across the table and frowned at her. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Beau\u2019s dark brown eyes widened and she started scrambling to pack up the maps. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure the notes are secure and then come back to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Beau,\u201d the older elf woman said sternly, stepping forward to put her hand on Beau\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake everything and run. As far and as fast as you can. You\u2019re the only one who can keep the location of the city safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, I\u2019m not just going to abandon you to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeau, don\u2019t argue. Just go.\u201d</p><p>Beau opened her mouth to continue arguing but Dairon made it clear that there would be no further discussion by walking back out of the tent. Beau cursed under her breath and hurriedly finished packing up the books. She paused when she reached the gold coin on the table, picking it up and rolling it around in her fingers. She could see the delicate carvings under her fingers. A tower on one side with a phrase written in a language that few people still understood how to read and a crowned woman\u2019s face on the other side.</p><p>\u201cBeau!\u201d Someone yelled outside. It wasn\u2019t Dairon, but she couldn\u2019t place the voice right away. \u201cDairon says to go! Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck,\u201d Beau hissed and stuffed the coin into her back pocket before running out the back flap of the tent. The sun was low in the sky as evening fell upon them. It would help in her escape but it would make fighting the enemy difficult. She ran up through the small path up the side of the canyon, climbing when it got too steep to walk. She was nearly half way up when she heard sounds of fighting start to rise in the valley. She secured herself to the rock face and then turned around to look down. The sand was kicking up in the chilly night wind and made it hard to tell what was going on. She spat out the sand that got in her mouth and narrowed her eyes, hoping to see how her order was fairing down there.</p><p>There was an explosion of fire that lit up the camp and Beau quickly counted the enemy. Seven- twelve- twenty-two, easily twice the amount of wizards to monks. She cursed again and looked at the rucksack hanging at her side. She looked around the face of the rock hurriedly and spotted a small cave that she hadn\u2019t seen from the ground. As she moved, it became clear that it was almost certainly obscured from view unless you were nearly right up on it. </p><p>Perfect.</p><p>She pulled the bag from her shoulder and stuffed it into the cave, her arm barely fitting inside, then she pushed rocks and sand over and around it so that if anyone did stumble upon the cave, maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice the rucksack anyway.</p><p>She swiftly made her way back down into the valley, ducking behind rocks as she began to hear voices.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the city?\u201d asked a deep, elderly voice, heavy with an accent she recognized. Zemnian, from the north. They were definitely from the Assembly.</p><p>She stepped over the dead body of one of her comrades, Bethany, and swiftly moved behind the main tent. There was movement inside as the wizards tore it apart. Someone answered and her heart sored with hope when she recognized that voice.</p><p>\u201cI will never tell you. You\u2019ll have to kill me, because I will never relent,\u201d Dairon said, her voice nasally like she was having a hard time breathing through her nose. Broken probably. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find it.\u201d She started to laugh and there was a smack as the man who\u2019d spoken smacked her across the face. \u201cDo your worst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, Expositor. I intend to. Tie her up and prepare her for travel to the capital.\u201d</p><p>Beau ducked around the tent and caught sight of the leader. An older man with graying hair and a receding hairline. He had deep set wrinkles and pale skin covered in light brown spots. His eyes though, they were vibrant and cruel and she was certain that she would never forget them for as long as she lived.</p><p>Which, based on what she was planning next, probably wouldn\u2019t be too long at all.</p><p>She launched herself at the man, growling. \u201cDie, you piece of shit!\u201d she exclaimed, sailing towards him through the air.</p><p>She never reached him though. A glowing purple hand snatched her out of the air and slammed her hard into the ground. Her vision went white and, even as it cleared, the scenery around her swam through her sight like fish. </p><p>All she could truly see were the eyes of the man staring down at her. \u201cA little lost lamb has come to say hello? This one of yours, Dairon?\u201d</p><p>Beau followed his eyes and spotted Dairon staring at her, her expression unreadable. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>The wizard hummed, clearly not believing her. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind watching her die.\u201d He stood over her and pointed down at her with his finger but Beau didn\u2019t look away from Dairon. The elf\u2019s eyes were sad but her jaw as clenched defiantly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Beau whispered, unsure if she was even speaking loud enough for anyone to hear. Dairon nodded slightly, so she must have at least read her lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>And then she died.</p>[[MORE]]<p><i>~Three years later~</i></p><p>Caleb groaned quietly as he woke. He usually tried not to make any noise to keep from alerting anyone or anything that might be nearby, but it was the first time in months that he\u2019d slept in a bed, so he couldn\u2019t suppress the pleased noise in the back of his throat.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Caleb,\u201d said a voice near his feet. </p><p>He glanced up and spotted his friend and partner in crime, Nott the Brave, sitting near his feet and turning something over in her hand. Her face was turned down apologetically and he instantly felt a cold nugget of dread in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he started, pushing himself up to look at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>She looked ashamed, but not hurt, so that was good. \u201cI\u2026 I lost control last night. I got the itch.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and reached out to put a comforting hand on her shoulder. \u201cAs long as you made it back safely, liebling, that\u2019s all the matters. Did you steal anything?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and shoved the little thing in her fingers back into her pocket. \u201cA few little things. Nothing anybody will miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Shall we go get some breakfast and go over your haul?\u201d</p><p>She brightened up when she realized that he wasn\u2019t cross with her and pushed herself off onto the floor. \u201cYes please!\u201d Caleb smiled slightly and got out of bed, taking a moment to brush off any dirt that had fallen loose from the coat he\u2019d slept in, and then leaning her out into the hallway. She paused in the doorway to pull her mask up over her goblin face and then gleefully followed him down, taking his hand on the stairs.</p><p>They set up at a table near the back, away from the morning crowd stumbling to the bar for coffee and/or hair of the dog. The waitress gave him a tired smile and took their orders before leaving them alone.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and gestured to her. \u201cWould you like to show me what you found?\u201d </p><p>The part where she showed off her prizes was almost as satisfying as the stealing itself. She grinned behind the mask and started pulling things out onto the table. A handful of buttons of various size and shape clattered on the table first. He recognized one as coming from a city guard\u2019s uniform and wanted to ask but decided that he would probably not like the answer. </p><p>\u201cThis one came from a little boy\u2019s backpack,\u201d she said, pointing to a tan one that was bigger than the rest. \u201cHe had curly brown hair and glasses.\u201d She got a far away look in her eye that he didn\u2019t try to interpret. They both had their secrets, it was better for their partnership that they keep them.</p><p>Next, she pulled out a necklace made of shells. It looked professionally made and probably fairly expensive, maybe she would be willing to part with that one so that they could sell it. It was always a gamble about which pieces she was okay with selling and which she wanted to keep. The value of the objects didn\u2019t seem to matter to her at all.</p><p>Lastly, she pulled out a gold coin and he realized that it was what she had been fiddling with earlier. \u201cThis coin looks weird but I thought we could use it to pay for another night here.\u201d She held it out to him and he took it from her appreciatively, looking the coin over. It did, indeed look weird.</p><p>On the front there was a side view portrait of a woman with what seemed to be long, straight hair and a high, regal collar. She was also wearing a three-pronged crown but he couldn\u2019t think of any countries off the top of his head that had female monarchs. Most of the female heads of state that he could remember were elected to their positions. Besides, the coin was old, as old as the Empire itself if he had to wager a guess.</p><p>He turned it over and his heart stopped. There was writing on the back, curled around the edges with a tower stamped in the middle. He didn\u2019t know what it said but he recognized the language on sight.</p><p>This was undercommon in the dialect of the Kryn, a forgotten dialect that was so different from its modern counterpart that there were entire teams of researchers working on translating it to Common. He knew, because he had once been on such a team.</p><p>\u201cNott,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice even to not attract any unwanted attention. \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom some lady. Why, is it special?\u201d</p><p>Caleb almost couldn\u2019t smother the grin that twitched on his face. He kissed Nott\u2019s head. \u201cThis is very, very special, meine freunde. This could change everything. I need to know where exactly you found it. Who did you take it from?\u201d</p><p>Nott hesitated then and started twisting her fingers nervously. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>The labor camp was hot as they walked along the dirt paths through the stacks of marble. There were people toiling sweatily around them, large muscled people with skin that had been darkened under the boiling sun.</p><p>\u201cThis is where you found it? What were doing in this part of town?\u201d</p><p>Nott was perched on his shoulders, holding onto his hair for dear life as the guard leading them through the camp gave her a curious look. \u201cI followed the guard here to steal his button and then I got lost trying to get out. The lady helped me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you stole from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, well- she wasn\u2019t looking!\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed and then cleared his throat and call ahead to the guard. \u201cThis woman, what\u2019s she in for?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not privy to that kind of information, and even if I was I wouldn\u2019t give a fuck. But, when I was told you were coming to see her I asked her that.\u201d</p><p>Caleb waited for him to continue but he didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said \u2018Fuck you, pig\u2019 and then spit on me so I smacked her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned and he and Nott exchanged worried glances. What kind of person were they getting caught up with? But still, Caleb wanted answers, so he continued forward.</p><p>The guards lead them to side of the quarry and Caleb looked up at a lithely muscled woman who was scaling the wall of marble with a rope tied to her belt. The guard pointed up at her. \u201cThat\u2019s Beauregard. She\u2019s the only one who fit your description.\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked at Nott who nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Beauregard made it up to the top of the marble and removed the rope of her belt to tie to something up top. \u201cAlright, line\u2019s secured.\u201d she called down. </p><p>\u201cBeauregard!\u201d the guard called up to her. She flipped him off without looking at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got visitors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, Paulie!\u201d</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat. \u201cAh, hello! Beauregard?\u201d</p><p>She finally turned to look at him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb glanced at the guard who was swiftly losing interest in them. \u201cMay we speak in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, man, you\u2019re gonna need to speak up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay we speak in-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Before he could yell again, the guard elbowed him and shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s fucking with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb blinked in confusion before turning back to her. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m coming down!\u201d</p><p>The guard, Paulie apparently, rolled his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s such an asshole.\u201d Then he started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cAh, how do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going far.\u201d He rested against a stack of marble just as Beauregard\u2019s feet hit the ground. She dusted her hands off on her pants and gave him and Nott cautious looks. </p><p>\u201cAlright, the fuck you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard, my name is Caleb Widogast. This is my partner, Nott the Brave. I believe you met last night.\u201d</p><p>Beau met Nott\u2019s eyes and the goblin tensed but she didn\u2019t seem angry. \u201cOh, yeah. You can just call me Beau. What\u2019s up?\u201d Caleb cleared his throat and pulled the gold coin from his pocket, holding it up for her to see. Her eyes widened and she smacked his arm down. \u201cDon\u2019t just pull that out like that, someone could see. Where did you find another one?\u201d</p><p>Caleb hesitated. \u201cThis is yours. Nott\u2026\u201d he let it trail off, hoping the young woman would catch up on her own.</p><p>She did and her eyes widened as she smacked her own ass to check her pockets and finding them empty. \u201cWha- It-\u201d Her eyes narrowed at Nott. \u201cYou.\u201d She took a step forward and Nott cried out in fear as she scrambled across Caleb\u2019s shoulders to put him between her and Beauregard. Instead of chasing her, Beauregard grabbed Caleb\u2019s wrist and tore the coin from his fingers. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re messing with, string bean.\u201d She shoved the coin into her pocket once more.</p><p>He decided to move passed the name calling for now. \u201cA-Actually, I do know. And I think\u2026\u201d he paused and glance at the guard over his shoulder but he was distracted whipping an inmate. \u201cI think we could help each other locate the city.\u201d</p><p>A smirk slithered across her face. \u201cI already know where the city is. If you want to go with, you\u2019re gonna need to do better than returning my own coin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can read the Kryn dialect.\u201d</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes. \u201cComprehend languages doesn\u2019t work on dead languages, Widogast, everyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that, how fucking stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can read it. I can really read it.\u201d Sort of. He could sort of read it. By the time he had left the translation team they hadn\u2019t quite cracked it yet, but he decided to leave that part out.</p><p>That made her pause. She frowned at him but her eyes were hopeful. \u201cOh yeah? Then what does the coin say? The words above the tower, what does it say?\u201d</p><p>He had only recognized one word out of the three, \u2018Night\u2019. He was making a guess that she didn\u2019t know what it said either and he only hoped that he was right because he was fairly certain that she would try to kill him if he got this wrong. \u201cThe Endless Night.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with narrowed eyes for a second and there was no change in her expression. Had she caught onto him? \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to help me break out,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>He let out a sigh and nodded. \u201cOf course. What do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips thoughtfully and nodded towards Paulie subtly. \u201cShake the guard\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>He blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan. Shake the guard\u2019s hand. You do that and we\u2019re a team.\u201d She started to turn away, but then she paused and glare at Nott. \u201cAnd if I find out you\u2019ve been anywhere near my pockets you\u2019re both on your fucking own.\u201d Then she walked out of sight around a stack of marble.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and adjusted his coat before turning to find the guard. \u201cPaulie, was it?\u201d he asked, stepping up to him as the man wound up his whip.</p><p>Paulie sneered. \u201cJust Paul.\u201d</p><p>Caleb held out his hand, which he suddenly realized was shaking slightly. \u201cThank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Paulie sighed and held the coiled whip under his arm, between his elbow and his ribs, then reached out with his newly free hand to shake Caleb\u2019s. In a flash, the whip was yanked out of his loose hold and there was a crack as Beau uncoiled it in her hand. She whipped it around Paulie\u2019s neck and then wrapped the end around again, pulling with all her strength. Caleb dropped Paulie\u2019s hand as he reached up to grasp at the whip, choking for air, but Beau gave no quarter. She held on until Paulie stopped moving and his eyes fell closed.</p><p>She was breathing heavily but smiling as she got back to her feet. \u201cRiot!\u201d she called at the top of her lungs. She grabbed Caleb\u2019s arm with the hand that wasn\u2019t holding the whip and dragged him swiftly through the quarry.</p><p>\u201cI like her!\u201d Nott called, grinning even as her mask fell down off her face and she held onto Caleb\u2019s coat with all she had. Caleb stumbled but didn\u2019t fall and followed the young woman up into the street as the prisoners rioted behind them.</p></p>",

Beau looked up from the maps that were strewn across the table and frowned at her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p><p>Beau&rsquo;s dark brown eyes widened and she started scrambling to pack up the maps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure the notes are secure and then come back to fight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Beau,&rdquo; the older elf woman said sternly, stepping forward to put her hand on Beau&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Take everything and run. As far and as fast as you can. You&rsquo;re the only one who can keep the location of the city safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No, I&rsquo;m not just going to abandon you to-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beau, don&rsquo;t argue. Just go.&rdquo;</p><p>Beau opened her mouth to continue arguing but Dairon made it clear that there would be no further discussion by walking back out of the tent. Beau cursed under her breath and hurriedly finished packing up the books. She paused when she reached the gold coin on the table, picking it up and rolling it around in her fingers. She could see the delicate carvings under her fingers. A tower on one side with a phrase written in a language that few people still understood how to read and a crowned woman&rsquo;s face on the other side.</p><p>&ldquo;Beau!&rdquo; Someone yelled outside. It wasn&rsquo;t Dairon, but she couldn&rsquo;t place the voice right away. &ldquo;Dairon says to go! Now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck, fuck, fuck,&rdquo; Beau hissed and stuffed the coin into her back pocket before running out the back flap of the tent. The sun was low in the sky as evening fell upon them. It would help in her escape but it would make fighting the enemy difficult. She ran up through the small path up the side of the canyon, climbing when it got too steep to walk. She was nearly half way up when she heard sounds of fighting start to rise in the valley.

The lady helped me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;And you stole from her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, well- she wasn&rsquo;t looking!&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb sighed and then cleared his throat and call ahead to the guard. &ldquo;This woman, what&rsquo;s she in for?&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not privy to that kind of information, and even if I was I wouldn&rsquo;t give a fuck. But, when I was told you were coming to see her I asked her that.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb waited for him to continue but he didn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She said &lsquo;Fuck you, pig&rsquo; and then spit on me so I smacked her.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb frowned and he and Nott exchanged worried glances. What kind of person were they getting caught up with? But still, Caleb wanted answers, so he continued forward.</p><p>The guards lead them to side of the quarry and Caleb looked up at a lithely muscled woman who was scaling the wall of marble with a rope tied to her belt. The guard pointed up at her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Beauregard. She&rsquo;s the only one who fit your description.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb looked at Nott who nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her.&rdquo;</p><p>Beauregard made it up to the top of the marble and removed the rope of her belt to tie to something up top. &ldquo;Alright, line&rsquo;s secured.&rdquo; she called down. </p><p>&ldquo;Beauregard!&rdquo; the guard called up to her. She flipped him off without looking at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got visitors!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very funny, Paulie!&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat. &ldquo;Ah, hello! Beauregard?&rdquo;</p><p>She finally turned to look at him. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb glanced at the guard who was swiftly losing interest in them. &ldquo;May we speak in private?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May we speak in-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you, man, you&rsquo;re gonna need to speak up!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May we speak in-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>Before he could yell again, the guard elbowed him and shook his head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fucking with you.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb blinked in confusion before turning back to her. &ldquo;Are you fucking with me?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming down!&rdquo;</p><p>The guard, Paulie apparently, rolled his eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s such an asshole.&rdquo; Then he started to walk away.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, how do we leave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going far.&rdquo; He rested against a stack of marble just as Beauregard&rsquo;s feet hit the ground. She dusted her hands off on her pants and gave him and Nott cautious looks. </p><p>&ldquo;Alright, the fuck you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Beauregard, my name is Caleb Widogast. This is my partner, Nott the Brave. I believe you met last night.&rdquo;</p><p>Beau met Nott&rsquo;s eyes and the goblin tensed but she didn&rsquo;t seem angry. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. You can just call me Beau. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Caleb cleared his throat and pulled the gold coin from his pocket, holding it up for her to see. Her eyes widened and she smacked his arm down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just pull that out like that, someone could see. Where did you find another one?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb hesitated. &ldquo;This is yours. Nott&hellip;&rdquo; he let it trail off, hoping the young woman would catch up on her own.</p><p>She did and her eyes widened as she smacked her own ass to check her pockets and finding them empty. &ldquo;Wha- It-&rdquo; Her eyes narrowed at Nott. &ldquo;You.&rdquo; She took a step forward and Nott cried out in fear as she scrambled across Caleb&rsquo;s shoulders to put him between her and Beauregard. Instead of chasing her, Beauregard grabbed Caleb&rsquo;s wrist and tore the coin from his fingers. &ldquo;You have no idea what you&rsquo;re messing with, string bean.&rdquo; She shoved the coin into her pocket once more.</p><p>He decided to move passed the name calling for now. &ldquo;A-Actually, I do know. And I think&hellip;&rdquo; he paused and glance at the guard over his shoulder but he was distracted whipping an inmate. &ldquo;I think we could help each other locate the city.&rdquo;</p><p>A smirk slithered across her face. &ldquo;I already know where the city is. If you want to go with, you&rsquo;re gonna need to do better than returning my own coin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can read the Kryn dialect.&rdquo;</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Comprehend languages doesn&rsquo;t work on dead languages, Widogast, everyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that, how fucking stupid do you think I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I can read it. I can really read it.&rdquo; Sort of. He could sort of read it. By the time he had left the translation team they hadn&rsquo;t quite cracked it yet, but he decided to leave that part out.</p><p>That made her pause. She frowned at him but her eyes were hopeful. &ldquo;Oh yeah? Then what does the coin say? The words above the tower, what does it say?&rdquo;</p><p>He had only recognized one word out of the three, &lsquo;Night&rsquo;. He was making a guess that she didn&rsquo;t know what it said either and he only hoped that he was right because he was fairly certain that she would try to kill him if he got this wrong. &ldquo;The Endless Night.&rdquo;</p><p>She stared at him with narrowed eyes for a second and there was no change in her expression. Had she caught onto him? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna need to help me break out,&rdquo; she said, finally.</p><p>He let out a sigh and nodded. &ldquo;Of course. What do you need from me?&rdquo;</p><p>She licked her lips thoughtfully and nodded towards Paulie subtly. &ldquo;Shake the guard&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p><p>He blinked in confusion. &ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a plan. Shake the guard&rsquo;s hand. You do that and we&rsquo;re a team.&rdquo; She started to turn away, but then she paused and glare at Nott. &ldquo;And if I find out you&rsquo;ve been anywhere near my pockets you&rsquo;re both on your fucking own.&rdquo; Then she walked out of sight around a stack of marble.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat and adjusted his coat before turning to find the guard. &ldquo;Paulie, was it?&rdquo; he asked, stepping up to him as the man wound up his whip.</p><p>Paulie sneered. &ldquo;Just Paul.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb held out his hand, which he suddenly realized was shaking slightly. &ldquo;Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</p><p>Paulie sighed and held the coiled whip under his arm, between his elbow and his ribs, then reached out with his newly free hand to shake Caleb&rsquo;s. In a flash, the whip was yanked out of his loose hold and there was a crack as Beau uncoiled it in her hand. She whipped it around Paulie&rsquo;s neck and then wrapped the end around again, pulling with all her strength. Caleb dropped Paulie&rsquo;s hand as he reached up to grasp at the whip, choking for air, but Beau gave no quarter. She held on until Paulie stopped moving and his eyes fell closed.</p><p>She was breathing heavily but smiling as she got back to her feet. &ldquo;Riot!&rdquo; she called at the top of her lungs. She grabbed Caleb&rsquo;s arm with the hand that wasn&rsquo;t holding the whip and dragged him swiftly through the quarry.</p><p>&ldquo;I like her!&rdquo; Nott called, grinning even as her mask fell down off her face and she held onto Caleb&rsquo;s coat with all she had. Caleb stumbled but didn&rsquo;t fall and followed the young woman up into the street as the prisoners rioted behind them.</p></p>",

Beau looked up from the maps that were strewn across the table and frowned at her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Beau&rsquo;s dark brown eyes widened and she started scrambling to pack up the maps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure the notes are secure and then come back to fight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No, Beau,&rdquo; the older elf woman said sternly, stepping forward to put her hand on Beau&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Take everything and run. As far and as fast as you can. You&rsquo;re the only one who can keep the location of the city safe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What? No, I&rsquo;m not just going to abandon you to-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Beau, don&rsquo;t argue. Just go.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Beau opened her mouth to continue arguing but Dairon made it clear that there would be no further discussion by walking back out of the tent. Beau cursed under her breath and hurriedly finished packing up the books. She paused when she reached the gold coin on the table, picking it up and rolling it around in her fingers. She could see the delicate carvings under her fingers. A tower on one side with a phrase written in a language that few people still understood how to read and a crowned woman&rsquo;s face on the other side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Beau!&rdquo; Someone yelled outside. It wasn&rsquo;t Dairon, but she couldn&rsquo;t place the voice right away. &ldquo;Dairon says to go! Now!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck, fuck, fuck,&rdquo; Beau hissed and stuffed the coin into her back pocket before running out the back flap of the tent. The sun was low in the sky as evening fell upon them. It would help in her escape but it would make fighting the enemy difficult. She ran up through the small path up the side of the canyon, climbing when it got too steep to walk. She was nearly half way up when she heard sounds of fighting start to rise in the valley. She secured herself to the rock face and then turned around to look down. The sand was kicking up in the chilly night wind and made it hard to tell what was going on. She spat out the sand that got in her mouth and narrowed her eyes, hoping to see how her order was fairing down there.</p>\n<p>There was an explosion of fire that lit up the camp and Beau quickly counted the enemy. Seven- twelve- twenty-two, easily twice the amount of wizards to monks. She cursed again and looked at the rucksack hanging at her side. She looked around the face of the rock hurriedly and spotted a small cave that she hadn&rsquo;t seen from the ground. As she moved, it became clear that it was almost certainly obscured from view unless you were nearly right up on it. </p>\n<p>Perfect.</p>\n<p>She pulled the bag from her shoulder and stuffed it into the cave, her arm barely fitting inside, then she pushed rocks and sand over and around it so that if anyone did stumble upon the cave, maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t notice the rucksack anyway.</p>\n<p>She swiftly made her way back down into the valley, ducking behind rocks as she began to hear voices.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where is the city?&rdquo; asked a deep, elderly voice, heavy with an accent she recognized. Zemnian, from the north. They were definitely from the Assembly.</p>\n<p>She stepped over the dead body of one of her comrades, Bethany, and swiftly moved behind the main tent. There was movement inside as the wizards tore it apart. Someone answered and her heart sored with hope when she recognized that voice.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will never tell you. You&rsquo;ll have to kill me, because I will never relent,&rdquo; Dairon said, her voice nasally like she was having a hard time breathing through her nose. Broken probably. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never find it.&rdquo; She started to laugh and there was a smack as the man who&rsquo;d spoken smacked her across the face. &ldquo;Do your worst!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, trust me, Expositor. I intend to. Tie her up and prepare her for travel to the capital.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Beau ducked around the tent and caught sight of the leader. An older man with graying hair and a receding hairline. He had deep set wrinkles and pale skin covered in light brown spots. His eyes though, they were vibrant and cruel and she was certain that she would never forget them for as long as she lived.</p>\n<p>Which, based on what she was planning next, probably wouldn&rsquo;t be too long at all.</p>\n<p>She launched herself at the man, growling. &ldquo;Die, you piece of shit!&rdquo; she exclaimed, sailing towards him through the air.</p>\n<p>She never reached him though. A glowing purple hand snatched her out of the air and slammed her hard into the ground. Her vision went white and, even as it cleared, the scenery around her swam through her sight like fish. </p>\n<p>All she could truly see were the eyes of the man staring down at her. &ldquo;A little lost lamb has come to say hello? This one of yours, Dairon?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Beau followed his eyes and spotted Dairon staring at her, her expression unreadable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen that woman in my life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The wizard hummed, clearly not believing her. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t mind watching her die.&rdquo; He stood over her and pointed down at her with his finger but Beau didn&rsquo;t look away from Dairon. The elf&rsquo;s eyes were sad but her jaw as clenched defiantly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Beau whispered, unsure if she was even speaking loud enough for anyone to hear. Dairon nodded slightly, so she must have at least read her lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then she died.</p>\n</p>",
