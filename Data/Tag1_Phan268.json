It makes the days pass by slow and the nights go by unbearably fast but, Dan wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. Their talks about life and passions; what they want out of their futures and what they hide from their past. It&rsquo;s all been slowly coming out of the boys but, everything they have been hiding from and keeping in the dark is all starting to come to the surface.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Dan hasn&rsquo;t felt this comfortable with someone in a long time. Carol felt safe but, she lost comfort along the way. Dan felt like he could tell Phil anything and everything; an old movie cliche but, it was true. Phil could make him laugh and smile; just about anything revolving around Phil could make Dan smile though. It was the happiest he has been in a long time and Dan didn\u2019t want to screw it up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Dan caught feelings for Phil and ever since he started walking him home, the feelings grew at an alarming rate. It felt like a rollercoaster; going up to the first drop was butterfly filled and then the drop takes your butterflies and makes them completely disappear but it takes everything else with it. Yet when the next drop comes, you just go with it; the anticipation and unknown still remains but, it&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of fun when it\u2019s over.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Phil was one of a kind and Dan didn\u2019t want to let him slip away; \u00a0he laughed at stupid puns and made even dumber ones. He wore mismatched socks and never ties his shoelaces quite right. He had a fringe most days but, secretly wore a quiff when he thought no one would see. He dyes his hair black and it complements his pale skin. He covers his mouth with his hands when he starts to really laugh and he does this weird thing with his hands when he tries to put them in his pockets. Those things were endearing and Dan picked up on them everytime Phil did them. Dan couldn\u2019t help his heart from fluttering when he sees that man smile or say something incredible inappropriate on accident.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Phil can get his heart racing from zero to a hundred and once it maxes out, it doesn\u2019t go back down. Dan\u2019s face is always flushed and now Becca has picked up on it. She knows they walk back home together but, Dan hasn\u2019t told her anything else. Even though, she asks more about Phil than she does about Dan. She wants the gossip and Dan just doesn&rsquo;t want to give it up. Whatever it is that he has with Phil is something special and unique; it was Dan\u2019s happy place and he didn&rsquo;t want to give it up even if they were just friends.</p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0It was Saturday and Dan actually had the day off. They had managed to find a new hire at the shop, however, Dan had grown partial to the evening shift&hellip;or rather the man he got to walk home every night he worked it. But, the schedule did change and Dan didn\u2019t have to work as much anymore.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He sat in his living room wearing his black Calvin Klein&rsquo;s with a switch remote in his hands racing other players in Mario Kart. He had a glass of tea balancing on the arm of his sofa that\u2019s now gone cold as the races continued, one after another. His curly hair was pushed up in quiff fashion and his eyebrows were drawn together in a scowl.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGet out of the fucking way!\u201d Dan screamed at his TV set while waving his left hand in frustration. \u201cCan people learn how to pl-\u201d</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Dan was in such a rage that he almost didn\u2019t hear his phone beep. He paused the game and looked around for his phone. He knew he was getting to invested into the game when it brought out actual rage so he grabbed his now not-so-hot tea and sat back into the sofa. Reaching over to his left, \u00a0he swiped his phone that was laying face down on the spot next to him.</p><p>He had a text message.</p><p>It was from Phil.</p><p>Dan\u2019s stomach dropped and his heart started to race a little faster. His face heated up and he knew that the red patch on his cheek would soon be a key feature to his face.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey Dan! I know we don\u2019t talk much outside of the cafe but, i was just wondering if you wanted to go do something with me tonight? Maybe a movie? Or even dinner?</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): I know it\u2019s Saturday so you probably already have plans</p><p>Phil (with one L): so feel free to say no</p><p>Phil (with one L): (&hellip;)</p><p>Phil (with one L):</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Dan\u2019s face was decorated with a smile that only makes its appearance when Phil was involved. Phil just asked him to go out with him,,, well not like out, out but like just go with him to do something and Dan was ecstatic. Any thought of Mario Kart has completely vanished from train of thought and now all he saw was Phil. \u00a0</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would love</p><p>No, too strong.</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would be</p><p>\u201cSo fucking excited actually,\u201d Dan said out loud with a huff of breath twiddling his thumbs over the touch screen of his phone instead of texting it out.</p><p>Dan: that would be great i dont have any \u00a0plans tonight so im all yours</p><p>Dan hit send and threw his phone towards the other end of the couch. His stomach was still hovering above his head when his phone beeped. He flung himself over to were his phone was laying and his palms grew sweaty. He picked his phone up and slowly turned it around to view the notification.</p><p>Carol: I saw this on the way to work this morning and it reminded me of you</p><p>Dan scrolled to see that she had sent him a picture of a Bowser action figure that was laying face down on on the sidewalk.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Dan typed out a quick reply about how that was actually him in his natural form and set his phone back down with the face of the phone resting on the couch.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Carol and him talk regularly. Things never went south and there wasn&rsquo;t a falling out; they remained friends and even became better at communication now that the pressures of a relationship were no longer present. However, she was not the person that he was looking for a response from at this moment. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 Dan sat and tapped his foot, twiddled his thumbs, rocked back and forth, did whatever fidget that he could while sitting on the sofa and he still hadn\u2019t gotten a reply back. It was going to drive him mad. Had Phil not liked his reply? Did phil find someone else to go with because Dan took to long thinking about what to say? Did Phil send it to Dan by accident? Maybe he really didn\u2019t want Dan to go with him tonight; maybe it was a mistake.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Dan hopped up into a standing position and ran his hands through his curly hair. He decided that no matter what or even if Phil replied, he should actually get dressed for the day even if was past noon. He headed for his bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was a mess. His face was flushed and palms where clammy; \u00a0he looked like a wreck. He turned his shower on and let the water heat up while he undressed which didn\u2019t take very long because he wasn\u2019t wearing much to begin with. He left his phone sitting in the lounge because he was the type of person that would check his phone a million times even while in the shower just to double check to make sure he didn\u2019t miss the ding of a new message.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0The hot water started to steam and the mirror was no longer a reliable source of reflection. Standing naked, Dan stepped into the shower. The water caressed his body in a gentle manner and his muscles started to relax at the pressure. He let the water cascade down his face, washing away his worry. He ran his hands over his arms and up to his shoulders only to find them in his hair. He opened his eyes and a white mist surrounded him, comforting him. He grabbed the bottle of soap and poured a decent amount onto his palms.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Reaching back up to his hair, he couldn\u2019t help but see the scars that littered his body. His ribs, shoulders, arms; they all had the remains of severe burn marks. Red and painful at times, his body was a constant reminder of everything he lost and everything that fire took. A flash of red and orange appeared in his eyes; that morning replaying again and again. The screams and faces of those around and the fingers pointing towards the burning bakery. Hearing screams of panic as his grandpa was stuck inside the burning building and the smell of smoke as Dan hurled himself into the flames towards his mentor. Debris falling in flames while the fire took more of Dan\u2019s heart as well as the room. Hitting him as he moved through the heat, the next thing that he remembers is blackness; a nothingness.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0A white light waking him up only to tell him his grandfather didn&rsquo;t make it and the store was reduced to a pile of charcoal. His childhood and local hero was gone and Dan was stuck in a hospital bed; bound and wrapped for burns.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Staring out of the window that no longer held functionality, Dan was brought back to the present; his present. The shower that once held comfort and worth just felt empty and cold. He turned the water off and grabbed the towel that was sitting on the sink. Drying his scar littered body off, he headed to his bedroom to find something to wear. He settled for a black hoodie, ripped black jeans, and a pair of fuzzy socks. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he then remembered that he was waiting for a text from Phil. He jumped up and basically ran for the lounge; his hands glided across the walls as he sped through. Acting like a school-aged child, he dover for his phone. Scrolling through random notifications from tumblr and twitter; random texts from family, he had not gotten one from Phil. He leaned his head down and sighed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the day, he kept himself busy. He did the laundry and cleaned his room, washed the dishes and put them away. Went to the store to get random things and organized his pantry. Still nothing; no ding or beep or flutter. Dan forgot how tiring having a crush was.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He sat down on the sofa and decided that he wasn&rsquo;t going to hear back from Phil tonight. He got on tumblr and starting rebloging; dogs, cats, text posts; memes, anything. Once Dan had forgotten about the text, he got one.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey sorry about that, my meeting with the art gallery lasted longer than expected. How\u2019s about we do both? Send me your address and I&rsquo;ll be there at 6!</p><p>Dan hastley typed up his address and could have screamed while doing so.</p><p>He spent the next 2 hours pacing back and forth and changing his outfit about 5 times only to go back to what he had on originally. He was getting more nervous with every passing second and his curls were getting more prominent the more he got anxious. He tried the internet hoping it would take his mind of things, and it did for a while until he heard his doorbell ring.</p>",

They had managed to find a new hire at the shop, however, Dan had grown partial to the evening shift\u2026or rather the man he got to walk home every night he worked it. But, the schedule did change and Dan didn\u2019t have to work as much anymore.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He sat in his living room wearing his black Calvin Klein\u2019s with a switch remote in his hands racing other players in Mario Kart. He had a glass of tea balancing on the arm of his sofa that\u2019s now gone cold as the races continued, one after another. His curly hair was pushed up in quiff fashion and his eyebrows were drawn together in a scowl.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGet out of the fucking way!\u201d Dan screamed at his TV set while waving his left hand in frustration. \u201cCan people learn how to pl-\u201d</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Dan was in such a rage that he almost didn\u2019t hear his phone beep. He paused the game and looked around for his phone. He knew he was getting to invested into the game when it brought out actual rage so he grabbed his now not-so-hot tea and sat back into the sofa. Reaching over to his left, \u00a0he swiped his phone that was laying face down on the spot next to him.</p><p>He had a text message.</p><p>It was from Phil.</p><p>Dan\u2019s stomach dropped and his heart started to race a little faster. His face heated up and he knew that the red patch on his cheek would soon be a key feature to his face.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey Dan! I know we don\u2019t talk much outside of the cafe but, i was just wondering if you wanted to go do something with me tonight? Maybe a movie? Or even dinner?</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): I know it\u2019s Saturday so you probably already have plans</p><p>Phil (with one L): so feel free to say no</p><p>Phil (with one L): (\u2026)</p><p>Phil (with one L):</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Dan\u2019s face was decorated with a smile that only makes its appearance when Phil was involved. Phil just asked him to go out with him,,, well not like out, out but like just go with him to do something and Dan was ecstatic. Any thought of Mario Kart has completely vanished from train of thought and now all he saw was Phil. \u00a0</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would love</p><p>No, too strong.</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would be</p><p>\u201cSo fucking excited actually,\u201d Dan said out loud with a huff of breath twiddling his thumbs over the touch screen of his phone instead of texting it out.</p><p>Dan: that would be great i dont have any \u00a0plans tonight so im all yours</p><p>Dan hit send and threw his phone towards the other end of the couch. His stomach was still hovering above his head when his phone beeped. He flung himself over to were his phone was laying and his palms grew sweaty. He picked his phone up and slowly turned it around to view the notification.</p><p>Carol: I saw this on the way to work this morning and it reminded me of you</p><p>Dan scrolled to see that she had sent him a picture of a Bowser action figure that was laying face down on on the sidewalk.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Dan typed out a quick reply about how that was actually him in his natural form and set his phone back down with the face of the phone resting on the couch.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Carol and him talk regularly. Things never went south and there wasn\u2019t a falling out; they remained friends and even became better at communication now that the pressures of a relationship were no longer present. However, she was not the person that he was looking for a response from at this moment. \u00a0</p><p> \u00a0 Dan sat and tapped his foot, twiddled his thumbs, rocked back and forth, did whatever fidget that he could while sitting on the sofa and he still hadn\u2019t gotten a reply back. It was going to drive him mad. Had Phil not liked his reply? Did phil find someone else to go with because Dan took to long thinking about what to say? Did Phil send it to Dan by accident? Maybe he really didn\u2019t want Dan to go with him tonight; maybe it was a mistake.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Dan hopped up into a standing position and ran his hands through his curly hair. He decided that no matter what or even if Phil replied, he should actually get dressed for the day even if was past noon. He headed for his bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was a mess. His face was flushed and palms where clammy; \u00a0he looked like a wreck. He turned his shower on and let the water heat up while he undressed which didn\u2019t take very long because he wasn\u2019t wearing much to begin with. He left his phone sitting in the lounge because he was the type of person that would check his phone a million times even while in the shower just to double check to make sure he didn\u2019t miss the ding of a new message.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0The hot water started to steam and the mirror was no longer a reliable source of reflection. Standing naked, Dan stepped into the shower. The water caressed his body in a gentle manner and his muscles started to relax at the pressure. He let the water cascade down his face, washing away his worry. He ran his hands over his arms and up to his shoulders only to find them in his hair. He opened his eyes and a white mist surrounded him, comforting him. He grabbed the bottle of soap and poured a decent amount onto his palms.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 Reaching back up to his hair, he couldn\u2019t help but see the scars that littered his body. His ribs, shoulders, arms; they all had the remains of severe burn marks. Red and painful at times, his body was a constant reminder of everything he lost and everything that fire took. A flash of red and orange appeared in his eyes; that morning replaying again and again. The screams and faces of those around and the fingers pointing towards the burning bakery. Hearing screams of panic as his grandpa was stuck inside the burning building and the smell of smoke as Dan hurled himself into the flames towards his mentor. Debris falling in flames while the fire took more of Dan\u2019s heart as well as the room. Hitting him as he moved through the heat, the next thing that he remembers is blackness; a nothingness.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0A white light waking him up only to tell him his grandfather didn\u2019t make it and the store was reduced to a pile of charcoal. His childhood and local hero was gone and Dan was stuck in a hospital bed; bound and wrapped for burns.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Staring out of the window that no longer held functionality, Dan was brought back to the present; his present. The shower that once held comfort and worth just felt empty and cold. He turned the water off and grabbed the towel that was sitting on the sink. Drying his scar littered body off, he headed to his bedroom to find something to wear. He settled for a black hoodie, ripped black jeans, and a pair of fuzzy socks. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he then remembered that he was waiting for a text from Phil. He jumped up and basically ran for the lounge; his hands glided across the walls as he sped through. Acting like a school-aged child, he dover for his phone. Scrolling through random notifications from tumblr and twitter; random texts from family, he had not gotten one from Phil. He leaned his head down and sighed.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of the day, he kept himself busy. He did the laundry and cleaned his room, washed the dishes and put them away. Went to the store to get random things and organized his pantry. Still nothing; no ding or beep or flutter. Dan forgot how tiring having a crush was.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0He sat down on the sofa and decided that he wasn\u2019t going to hear back from Phil tonight. He got on tumblr and starting rebloging; dogs, cats, text posts; memes, anything. Once Dan had forgotten about the text, he got one.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey sorry about that, my meeting with the art gallery lasted longer than expected. How\u2019s about we do both? Send me your address and I\u2019ll be there at 6!</p><p>Dan hastley typed up his address and could have screamed while doing so.</p><p>He spent the next 2 hours pacing back and forth and changing his outfit about 5 times only to go back to what he had on originally. He was getting more nervous with every passing second and his curls were getting more prominent the more he got anxious. He tried the internet hoping it would take his mind of things, and it did for a while until he heard his doorbell ring.</p></p>",

It makes the days pass by slow and the nights go by unbearably fast but, Dan wouldn\u2019t change it for anything. Their talks about life and passions; what they want out of their futures and what they hide from their past. It\u2019s all been slowly coming out of the boys but, everything they have been hiding from and keeping in the dark is all starting to come to the surface.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Dan hasn\u2019t felt this comfortable with someone in a long time. Carol felt safe but, she lost comfort along the way. Dan felt like he could tell Phil anything and everything; an old movie cliche but, it was true. Phil could make him laugh and smile; just about anything revolving around Phil could make Dan smile though. It was the happiest he has been in a long time and Dan didn\u2019t want to screw it up.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Dan caught feelings for Phil and ever since he started walking him home, the feelings grew at an alarming rate. It felt like a rollercoaster; going up to the first drop was butterfly filled and then the drop takes your butterflies and makes them completely disappear but it takes everything else with it. Yet when the next drop comes, you just go with it; the anticipation and unknown still remains but, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun when it\u2019s over.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Phil was one of a kind and Dan didn\u2019t want to let him slip away; \u00a0he laughed at stupid puns and made even dumber ones. He wore mismatched socks and never ties his shoelaces quite right. He had a fringe most days but, secretly wore a quiff when he thought no one would see. He dyes his hair black and it complements his pale skin. He covers his mouth with his hands when he starts to really laugh and he does this weird thing with his hands when he tries to put them in his pockets. Those things were endearing and Dan picked up on them everytime Phil did them. Dan couldn\u2019t help his heart from fluttering when he sees that man smile or say something incredible inappropriate on accident.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0Phil can get his heart racing from zero to a hundred and once it maxes out, it doesn\u2019t go back down. Dan\u2019s face is always flushed and now Becca has picked up on it. She knows they walk back home together but, Dan hasn\u2019t told her anything else. Even though, she asks more about Phil than she does about Dan. She wants the gossip and Dan just doesn\u2019t want to give it up.

They had managed to find a new hire at the shop, however, Dan had grown partial to the evening shift&hellip;or rather the man he got to walk home every night he worked it. But, the schedule did change and Dan didn&rsquo;t have to work as much anymore.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;He sat in his living room wearing his black Calvin Klein&rsquo;s with a switch remote in his hands racing other players in Mario Kart. He had a glass of tea balancing on the arm of his sofa that&rsquo;s now gone cold as the races continued, one after another. His curly hair was pushed up in quiff fashion and his eyebrows were drawn together in a scowl.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Get out of the fucking way!&rdquo; Dan screamed at his TV set while waving his left hand in frustration. &ldquo;Can people learn how to pl-&rdquo;</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Dan was in such a rage that he almost didn&rsquo;t hear his phone beep. He paused the game and looked around for his phone. He knew he was getting to invested into the game when it brought out actual rage so he grabbed his now not-so-hot tea and sat back into the sofa. Reaching over to his left, &nbsp;he swiped his phone that was laying face down on the spot next to him.</p><p>He had a text message.</p><p>It was from Phil.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s stomach dropped and his heart started to race a little faster. His face heated up and he knew that the red patch on his cheek would soon be a key feature to his face.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey Dan! I know we don&rsquo;t talk much outside of the cafe but, i was just wondering if you wanted to go do something with me tonight? Maybe a movie? Or even dinner?</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): I know it&rsquo;s Saturday so you probably already have plans</p><p>Phil (with one L): so feel free to say no</p><p>Phil (with one L): (&hellip;)</p><p>Phil (with one L):</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Dan&rsquo;s face was decorated with a smile that only makes its appearance when Phil was involved. Phil just asked him to go out with him,,, well not like out, out but like just go with him to do something and Dan was ecstatic. Any thought of Mario Kart has completely vanished from train of thought and now all he saw was Phil. &nbsp;</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would love</p><p>No, too strong.</p><p>Dan: hey phil! I would be</p><p>&ldquo;So fucking excited actually,&rdquo; Dan said out loud with a huff of breath twiddling his thumbs over the touch screen of his phone instead of texting it out.</p><p>Dan: that would be great i dont have any &nbsp;plans tonight so im all yours</p><p>Dan hit send and threw his phone towards the other end of the couch. His stomach was still hovering above his head when his phone beeped. He flung himself over to were his phone was laying and his palms grew sweaty. He picked his phone up and slowly turned it around to view the notification.</p><p>Carol: I saw this on the way to work this morning and it reminded me of you</p><p>Dan scrolled to see that she had sent him a picture of a Bowser action figure that was laying face down on on the sidewalk.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Dan typed out a quick reply about how that was actually him in his natural form and set his phone back down with the face of the phone resting on the couch.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol and him talk regularly. Things never went south and there wasn&rsquo;t a falling out; they remained friends and even became better at communication now that the pressures of a relationship were no longer present. However, she was not the person that he was looking for a response from at this moment. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp; Dan sat and tapped his foot, twiddled his thumbs, rocked back and forth, did whatever fidget that he could while sitting on the sofa and he still hadn&rsquo;t gotten a reply back. It was going to drive him mad. Had Phil not liked his reply? Did phil find someone else to go with because Dan took to long thinking about what to say? Did Phil send it to Dan by accident? Maybe he really didn&rsquo;t want Dan to go with him tonight; maybe it was a mistake.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Dan hopped up into a standing position and ran his hands through his curly hair. He decided that no matter what or even if Phil replied, he should actually get dressed for the day even if was past noon. He headed for his bathroom and looked in the mirror. He was a mess. His face was flushed and palms where clammy; &nbsp;he looked like a wreck. He turned his shower on and let the water heat up while he undressed which didn&rsquo;t take very long because he wasn&rsquo;t wearing much to begin with. He left his phone sitting in the lounge because he was the type of person that would check his phone a million times even while in the shower just to double check to make sure he didn&rsquo;t miss the ding of a new message.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;The hot water started to steam and the mirror was no longer a reliable source of reflection. Standing naked, Dan stepped into the shower. The water caressed his body in a gentle manner and his muscles started to relax at the pressure. He let the water cascade down his face, washing away his worry. He ran his hands over his arms and up to his shoulders only to find them in his hair. He opened his eyes and a white mist surrounded him, comforting him. He grabbed the bottle of soap and poured a decent amount onto his palms.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Reaching back up to his hair, he couldn&rsquo;t help but see the scars that littered his body. His ribs, shoulders, arms; they all had the remains of severe burn marks. Red and painful at times, his body was a constant reminder of everything he lost and everything that fire took. A flash of red and orange appeared in his eyes; that morning replaying again and again. The screams and faces of those around and the fingers pointing towards the burning bakery. Hearing screams of panic as his grandpa was stuck inside the burning building and the smell of smoke as Dan hurled himself into the flames towards his mentor. Debris falling in flames while the fire took more of Dan&rsquo;s heart as well as the room. Hitting him as he moved through the heat, the next thing that he remembers is blackness; a nothingness.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;A white light waking him up only to tell him his grandfather didn&rsquo;t make it and the store was reduced to a pile of charcoal. His childhood and local hero was gone and Dan was stuck in a hospital bed; bound and wrapped for burns.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Staring out of the window that no longer held functionality, Dan was brought back to the present; his present. The shower that once held comfort and worth just felt empty and cold. He turned the water off and grabbed the towel that was sitting on the sink. Drying his scar littered body off, he headed to his bedroom to find something to wear. He settled for a black hoodie, ripped black jeans, and a pair of fuzzy socks. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he then remembered that he was waiting for a text from Phil. He jumped up and basically ran for the lounge; his hands glided across the walls as he sped through. Acting like a school-aged child, he dover for his phone. Scrolling through random notifications from tumblr and twitter; random texts from family, he had not gotten one from Phil. He leaned his head down and sighed.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the day, he kept himself busy. He did the laundry and cleaned his room, washed the dishes and put them away. Went to the store to get random things and organized his pantry. Still nothing; no ding or beep or flutter. Dan forgot how tiring having a crush was.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;He sat down on the sofa and decided that he wasn&rsquo;t going to hear back from Phil tonight. He got on tumblr and starting rebloging; dogs, cats, text posts; memes, anything. Once Dan had forgotten about the text, he got one.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Phil (with one L): Hey sorry about that, my meeting with the art gallery lasted longer than expected. How&rsquo;s about we do both? Send me your address and I&rsquo;ll be there at 6!</p><p>Dan hastley typed up his address and could have screamed while doing so.</p><p>He spent the next 2 hours pacing back and forth and changing his outfit about 5 times only to go back to what he had on originally. He was getting more nervous with every passing second and his curls were getting more prominent the more he got anxious. He tried the internet hoping it would take his mind of things, and it did for a while until he heard his doorbell ring.</p></p>",
