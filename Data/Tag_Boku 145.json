Also some swearing here and there skksks.</p><p>I\u2019m going to do all of the 14 prompts so let\u2019s-a-go </p><p>Also I\u2019m like two days late, let\u2019s see if I can do day two and day three by today</p><p>~ </p><p>Denki was really fucking nervous. \u00a0</p><p>Like shitting bricks nervous. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how or when but he was convinced to ask Jirou out. </p><p>His fucking crush. </p><p>At first, he really liked her as a person. She was badass and has great music taste and didn\u2019t take shit from anyone else. Of course, she would tease him every now and then but he was used to it. She was a chill tomboy, he respected that. All girls are cute in their own ways. \u00a0</p><p>But it really started to get him to see how she was in action. \u00a0</p><p>She was fearless. \u00a0</p><p>And he was in awe. </p><p>Then he really noticed how she was, not that he didn\u2019t realize it before, and he fell hard. </p><p>All of his friends knew before he even noticed himself. They would nudge him every time she walked by or entered the classroom, giggling like school girls and being obnoxious. </p><p>Yeah, he would flirt with all the other girls, like he did normally, but when it came to her, he would instantly freeze or stumble on his words. She was different and he didn\u2019t want to mess that up. So, he went to his last resort, his only hope: his friends. </p><p>\u201cFinally, you fucking admit it. Took you long enough,\u201d Bakugou huffed and crossed his arms. \u201cI seriously thought it would take you even longer for your pea sized brain to figure it out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBakugou! Don\u2019t be so mean to him! His new to this beautiful world of crushing.\u201d Mina exclaimed, clasping her hands together, \u201cMy baby grew up.\u201d She wiped away a fake tear and sniffed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d Denki massaged his neck in embarrassment. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Denki, we\u2019re going to make sure that Jirou will definitely say yes!\u201d Kirishima said, a wide grin spreading on his face. \u00a0</p><p>They were all currently sitting in the lunch room. Denki was sitting between Sero and Mina. Across from him was Kirishima and Bakugou who Kirishima was trying to calm down Bakugou from throwing a bowl of rice at Midoriya who was trying to talk to him about their next team up. </p><p>\u201cYou just gotta get to the point, you know, smoothly get onto the topic and steal her heart but not take too long to get to it.\u201d Sero thought out loud. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr you can do something romantic like taking her out to dinner and asking her there!\u201d Mina sighed as she daydreamed how cute it would be. </p><p>\u201cWhy not just tell her straight up? You know \u201chey I like you a lot, wanna go out?\u201d Bakugou said bluntly while crossing his arms. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t just say that! You gotta build it up! You know, ease her into the situation?\u201d Denki winced at his words, not sure if that is the right way. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy, take my advice and ask her after school.\u201d Sero wrapped his arm around him, beaming a bright smile to him. He felt confident. He\u2019s going to do it, he\u2019s actually going to do it. \u00a0</p><p>The bell rang and everyone threw away their trash and headed to class. </p><p>\u201cListen, just relax about it ok? It doesn\u2019t have to be nothing fancy just say your feelings and see if she accepts them, ok?\u201d Kirshima wrapped his arm on this shoulder as he was walking. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t feel the same way then it\u2019s ok. You\u2019ll always have us by your side.\u201d He looked over to the Bakusquad as they chatted and made jokes. He was so glad to have them. </p><p>Denki instantly felt better, his stress leaving his side. But he still felt nervous. \u00a0</p><p>~ </p><p>\u201cHey Jirou, would you mind if you would stay after class for a bit? I need to talk to you.\u201d Denki grabbed her wrist, stopping her from leaving with Momo. </p><p>\u201cUh sure, I\u2019ll see you later Yamomo.\u201d Jirou looked over her shoulder. Momo gave her a nod and a smile appeared on her face. She quickly walked off, knowing what Denki was going to do. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up Pikachu?\u201d Gosh, he gets soft every time she calls him that. The way she says it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s picking on him. It fits naturally with him. </p><p>The classroom was now fully empty. The sunlight was pouring through the windows with the trees on the side, making the shadows inside the classroom looking like a fantasy world. </p><p>Denki took a deep breath and composed himself. Just say it. Get to the point. </p><p>\u201cSo, since Valentine\u2019s Day is coming up and everyone is asking each other out it made me have the courage to tell that I &hellip;\u201d A deep breath was taken. This is it. \u201cThat I like you. A lot. I think, no, you are a really cool person and I really enjoy being with you and I-\u201d he huffed, stringing the words he wanted to say, the words he has dreamt of. \u201creally, really like you Jirou. And I was wondering if you would like to go out with me?\u201d he rushed his last few words, already wanting this to be over. </p><p>There, he said it, it\u2019s out in the open and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it now. He gripped the edge of the table, the pain distracting him. What if he seemed too forced? Is he coming off as a creep? He doesn\u2019t know how to handle this. How is he supposed to talk to her normally after all of- </p><p>\u201cDenki.\u201d He quickly snapped out his thoughts. He looked over to Jirou, already guessing what\u2019s she going to say. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to go out with you.\u201d she said with a genuine smile. </p><p>\u201cW-what?! Are you serious? Are you just saying yes because you feel bad for me?!\u201d Denki questioned. He didn\u2019t expect this. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go out with you. And no, I am not doing this because I feel bad. I\u2019m doing it because I like you too, you idiot.\u201d She flicked his forehead, the feeling reassuring and snapping back to reality. </p><p>Ohmygosh this is happening. This isn\u2019t a dream, he did it. He asked his crush out and she said yes! </p><p>\u201cSo does 7 sound good to go out?\u201d Jirou asked smoothly, smirking at Denki\u2019s flustered form. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah, I\u2019ll pick you up then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She waved goodbye and left the classroom. Right when she left Denki let out a cry of joy and pumped his fist into the air. Jirou laughed quietly to herself. </p><p>~</p><p>Tag List: Open!

Also some swearing here and there skksks.</p><p>I\u2019m going to do all of the 14 prompts so let\u2019s-a-go </p><p>Also I\u2019m like two days late, let\u2019s see if I can do day two and day three by today</p><p>~ </p><p>Denki was really fucking nervous. \u00a0</p><p>Like shitting bricks nervous. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t know how or when but he was convinced to ask Jirou out. </p><p>His fucking crush. </p><p>At first, he really liked her as a person. She was badass and has great music taste and didn\u2019t take shit from anyone else. Of course, she would tease him every now and then but he was used to it. She was a chill tomboy, he respected that. All girls are cute in their own ways. \u00a0</p><p>But it really started to get him to see how she was in action. \u00a0</p><p>She was fearless. \u00a0</p><p>And he was in awe. </p><p>Then he really noticed how she was, not that he didn\u2019t realize it before, and he fell hard. </p><p>All of his friends knew before he even noticed himself. They would nudge him every time she walked by or entered the classroom, giggling like school girls and being obnoxious. </p><p>Yeah, he would flirt with all the other girls, like he did normally, but when it came to her, he would instantly freeze or stumble on his words. She was different and he didn\u2019t want to mess that up. So, he went to his last resort, his only hope: his friends. </p><p>\u201cFinally, you fucking admit it. Took you long enough,\u201d Bakugou huffed and crossed his arms. \u201cI seriously thought it would take you even longer for your pea sized brain to figure it out.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBakugou! Don\u2019t be so mean to him! His new to this beautiful world of crushing.\u201d Mina exclaimed, clasping her hands together, \u201cMy baby grew up.\u201d She wiped away a fake tear and sniffed. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d Denki massaged his neck in embarrassment. </p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Denki, we\u2019re going to make sure that Jirou will definitely say yes!\u201d Kirishima said, a wide grin spreading on his face. \u00a0</p><p>They were all currently sitting in the lunch room. Denki was sitting between Sero and Mina. Across from him was Kirishima and Bakugou who Kirishima was trying to calm down Bakugou from throwing a bowl of rice at Midoriya who was trying to talk to him about their next team up. </p><p>\u201cYou just gotta get to the point, you know, smoothly get onto the topic and steal her heart but not take too long to get to it.\u201d Sero thought out loud. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cOr you can do something romantic like taking her out to dinner and asking her there!\u201d Mina sighed as she daydreamed how cute it would be. </p><p>\u201cWhy not just tell her straight up? You know \u201chey I like you a lot, wanna go out?\u201d Bakugou said bluntly while crossing his arms. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t just say that! You gotta build it up! You know, ease her into the situation?\u201d Denki winced at his words, not sure if that is the right way. </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy, take my advice and ask her after school.\u201d Sero wrapped his arm around him, beaming a bright smile to him. He felt confident. He\u2019s going to do it, he\u2019s actually going to do it. \u00a0</p><p>The bell rang and everyone threw away their trash and headed to class. </p><p>\u201cListen, just relax about it ok? It doesn\u2019t have to be nothing fancy just say your feelings and see if she accepts them, ok?\u201d Kirshima wrapped his arm on this shoulder as he was walking. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t feel the same way then it\u2019s ok. You\u2019ll always have us by your side.\u201d He looked over to the Bakusquad as they chatted and made jokes. He was so glad to have them. </p><p>Denki instantly felt better, his stress leaving his side. But he still felt nervous. \u00a0</p><p>~ </p><p>\u201cHey Jirou, would you mind if you would stay after class for a bit? I need to talk to you.\u201d Denki grabbed her wrist, stopping her from leaving with Momo. </p><p>\u201cUh sure, I\u2019ll see you later Yamomo.\u201d Jirou looked over her shoulder. Momo gave her a nod and a smile appeared on her face. She quickly walked off, knowing what Denki was going to do. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up Pikachu?\u201d Gosh, he gets soft every time she calls him that. The way she says it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s picking on him. It fits naturally with him. </p><p>The classroom was now fully empty. The sunlight was pouring through the windows with the trees on the side, making the shadows inside the classroom looking like a fantasy world. </p><p>Denki took a deep breath and composed himself. Just say it. Get to the point. </p><p>\u201cSo, since Valentine\u2019s Day is coming up and everyone is asking each other out it made me have the courage to tell that I \u2026\u201d A deep breath was taken. This is it. \u201cThat I like you. A lot. I think, no, you are a really cool person and I really enjoy being with you and I-\u201d he huffed, stringing the words he wanted to say, the words he has dreamt of. \u201creally, really like you Jirou. And I was wondering if you would like to go out with me?\u201d he rushed his last few words, already wanting this to be over. </p><p>There, he said it, it\u2019s out in the open and there\u2019s nothing he can do about it now. He gripped the edge of the table, the pain distracting him. What if he seemed too forced? Is he coming off as a creep? He doesn\u2019t know how to handle this. How is he supposed to talk to her normally after all of- </p><p>\u201cDenki.\u201d He quickly snapped out his thoughts. He looked over to Jirou, already guessing what\u2019s she going to say. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to go out with you.\u201d she said with a genuine smile. </p><p>\u201cW-what?! Are you serious? Are you just saying yes because you feel bad for me?!\u201d Denki questioned. He didn\u2019t expect this. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go out with you. And no, I am not doing this because I feel bad. I\u2019m doing it because I like you too, you idiot.\u201d She flicked his forehead, the feeling reassuring and snapping back to reality. </p><p>Ohmygosh this is happening. This isn\u2019t a dream, he did it. He asked his crush out and she said yes! </p><p>\u201cSo does 7 sound good to go out?\u201d Jirou asked smoothly, smirking at Denki\u2019s flustered form. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah, I\u2019ll pick you up then.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d She waved goodbye and left the classroom. Right when she left Denki let out a cry of joy and pumped his fist into the air. Jirou laughed quietly to herself. </p><p>~</p><p>Tag List: Open!
