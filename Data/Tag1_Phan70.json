He drags himself back to Phil&rsquo;s bedroom, kicking his shoes off and climbing under the sheets.</p><p>Phil watches the saddened boy slip away and sighs. He can\u2019t believe the news either, knowing just how heartbroken Dan feels. Deciding to try and comfort Dan, he puts the kettle on and makes them both a sweet cup of tea. When he walks into the room, he sees the lump in the duvet and places one of the cups down beside it on the bedside table. </p><p>\u201cHey, I made you some tea\u2026\u201d Phil whispers, stroking his hand up and down the lump before walking over to his side of the bed, placing his own cup down and climbing in himself.</p><p>\u201cdid you want to talk about it?\u201d Phil asks softly. The sheets shuffle and arms wrap around his waist, a flushed face snuggles itself into his stomach and doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cyou don\u2019t have to, I just thought\u2026 maybe talking about your problems is better than keeping them in\u2026\u201d Phil mirrors what Dan had said two nights ago.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he lied to me\u201d Dan replies quietly, sniffling a little.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t either. I&rsquo;m so sorry, Dan. You don\u2019t have to do it, you know?\u201d Phil asks. The sheets shuffle, and Dan&rsquo;s wet cheeks and his face appears from under them.</p><p>\u201cI still want to\u201d he replies, sniffling and wiping his cheeks, letting out a trapped sigh.</p><p>\u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d Phil asks, a little shocked by the boy\u2019s mood change</p><p>\u201cI want to kill the son of a bitch myself. Sure I\u2019m upset, heartbroken even, but if the piece of shit needs to die for what he has done- I want to do it myself.\u201d Dan explains, suddenly jumping out of bed and walking out into the lounge. Phil quickly follows after him and watches him grab his phone and look something up.</p><p>\u201care you sure? This is pretty heavy stuff-\u201c Phil comforts, but Dan shakes his head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m upset. I&rsquo;m happy. I&rsquo;m going to make sure he sees my face when he dies because finally, he will realise that- t-that-\u201c and Dan starts breaking down again. He stands still, looking down at his phone and tears quickly rerun down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cHey, hey Dan, come here\u201d Phil collects Dan his arms and lets him sob.</p><p>\u201cI just want him to suffer. H-he\u2019s a fucking terrorist! He\u2019s murdered people, innocent people! And fucking tricked me into thinking I was loved\u2026\u201d Dan whimpers into Phil&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>\u201cbut you are loved, Dan\u2026 by your mum, your dad, and me. Especially me, Dan. You didn\u2019t deserve someone so awful in your life, and I promise I will never be like that to you. You\u2019re so precious to me. If you want to go through with it, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Phil presses a soft kiss to Dan&rsquo;s damp cheek and continues hugging him. </p><p>\u201cthank you, Phil. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so much too. Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to bed, and we will discuss our plan tomorrow\u201d Phil leads Dan back into the bedroom and makes sure he was comfortable before laying down and comforting the sad boy.</p><p>The next day comes quicker than expected. The two planned a set up to get Lewis in a vulnerable position, where he would least expect it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go pick up the flowers before we leave, and you\u2019ll sneak in through the fire escape leading up to his kitchen. Keep the earpiece on, and I\u2019ll let you know if we are moving\u201d Dan explains, checking his pistols bullets and hiding one up the leg of his jeans and the other tucked in the back of his jeans and hidden under his loose black and white grid button up shirt. Phil dresses in some black pants and a free shirt also, his guns up his legs with his knife and extra ammo and of course, his glasses. </p><p>They leave soon after. Dan buys some red roses wrapped with cellophane and Phil follows as they arrive in the street that Lewis lives. </p><p>\u201chead down there, the fire escape is open and climb it and wait at the top\u201d Dan whispers, pointing down the alley beside the house. Phil nods and runs down the dark lane and up the stairs. Dan nods when he sees Phil at the top, crouching and hiding. </p><p>Dan then walks up to the front steps of the house, roses in hand and knocks on the large wooden door 3 times. Surprisingly within a few seconds, the door opens, and he is met with the taller man with stubble, dark brown messy hair and grey eyes. </p><p>\u201ch-hey Lewis\u2026\u201d Dan introduces himself. Lewis looks shocked, or more like Dan was an inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cDan? what the fuck are you doing here?\u201d He asks, looking around behind Dan for anyone else, acting suspiciously. </p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you these\u2026 i-i&rsquo;m sorry I upset you somehow, I just was hoping we could chat?\u201d Dan asks, handing him the roses. Lewis looks at him confused but sighs and opens the door more, letting Dan in.</p><p>\u201cthanks\u201d Dan replies, quickly and unnoticeably turning his earpiece on so Phil could hear. Dan walks up to the stairs to the living room and sits down, and Lewis does too.</p><p>\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be here, Dan. I told you we were through\u201d Lewis sighs.</p><p>\u201ci-i was hoping we could get back together actually\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I did wrong so I wanted to fix it for you so you would love me again\u2026\u201d Dan mumbles.</p><p>\u201cfucks sake, that&rsquo;s it? Is that all you wanted? Like I said, I don\u2019t want you anymore. You want to know why I don\u2019t? Because you\u2019re useless, pathetic even. Can\u2019t look after yourself when I\u2019m trying to do shit, and I got sick of it. I was supposed to do something in Paris, but you got in the way, so I left you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d Dan asks quietly, looking sadly into Lewis\u2019 eyes. </p><p>\u201cReally. now, I&rsquo;m meeting some people soon so you\u2019ll need to leave.\u201d Lewis stands up.</p><p>\u201cw-wait, let me at least put the roses in water.

He drags himself back to Phil\u2019s bedroom, kicking his shoes off and climbing under the sheets.</p><p>Phil watches the saddened boy slip away and sighs. He can\u2019t believe the news either, knowing just how heartbroken Dan feels. Deciding to try and comfort Dan, he puts the kettle on and makes them both a sweet cup of tea. When he walks into the room, he sees the lump in the duvet and places one of the cups down beside it on the bedside table. </p><p>\u201cHey, I made you some tea\u2026\u201d Phil whispers, stroking his hand up and down the lump before walking over to his side of the bed, placing his own cup down and climbing in himself.</p><p>\u201cdid you want to talk about it?\u201d Phil asks softly. The sheets shuffle and arms wrap around his waist, a flushed face snuggles itself into his stomach and doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cyou don\u2019t have to, I just thought\u2026 maybe talking about your problems is better than keeping them in\u2026\u201d Phil mirrors what Dan had said two nights ago.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he lied to me\u201d Dan replies quietly, sniffling a little.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t either. I\u2019m so sorry, Dan. You don\u2019t have to do it, you know?\u201d Phil asks. The sheets shuffle, and Dan\u2019s wet cheeks and his face appears from under them.</p><p>\u201cI still want to\u201d he replies, sniffling and wiping his cheeks, letting out a trapped sigh.</p><p>\u201cw-what do you mean?\u201d Phil asks, a little shocked by the boy\u2019s mood change</p><p>\u201cI want to kill the son of a bitch myself. Sure I\u2019m upset, heartbroken even, but if the piece of shit needs to die for what he has done- I want to do it myself.\u201d Dan explains, suddenly jumping out of bed and walking out into the lounge. Phil quickly follows after him and watches him grab his phone and look something up.</p><p>\u201care you sure? This is pretty heavy stuff-\u201c Phil comforts, but Dan shakes his head with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m going to make sure he sees my face when he dies because finally, he will realise that- t-that-\u201c and Dan starts breaking down again. He stands still, looking down at his phone and tears quickly rerun down his cheeks. </p><p>\u201cHey, hey Dan, come here\u201d Phil collects Dan his arms and lets him sob.</p><p>\u201cI just want him to suffer. H-he\u2019s a fucking terrorist! He\u2019s murdered people, innocent people! And fucking tricked me into thinking I was loved\u2026\u201d Dan whimpers into Phil\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cbut you are loved, Dan\u2026 by your mum, your dad, and me. Especially me, Dan. You didn\u2019t deserve someone so awful in your life, and I promise I will never be like that to you. You\u2019re so precious to me. If you want to go through with it, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Phil presses a soft kiss to Dan\u2019s damp cheek and continues hugging him. </p><p>\u201cthank you, Phil. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so much too. Come on, let\u2019s go back to bed, and we will discuss our plan tomorrow\u201d Phil leads Dan back into the bedroom and makes sure he was comfortable before laying down and comforting the sad boy.</p><p>The next day comes quicker than expected. The two planned a set up to get Lewis in a vulnerable position, where he would least expect it. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go pick up the flowers before we leave, and you\u2019ll sneak in through the fire escape leading up to his kitchen. Keep the earpiece on, and I\u2019ll let you know if we are moving\u201d Dan explains, checking his pistols bullets and hiding one up the leg of his jeans and the other tucked in the back of his jeans and hidden under his loose black and white grid button up shirt. Phil dresses in some black pants and a free shirt also, his guns up his legs with his knife and extra ammo and of course, his glasses. </p><p>They leave soon after. Dan buys some red roses wrapped with cellophane and Phil follows as they arrive in the street that Lewis lives. </p><p>\u201chead down there, the fire escape is open and climb it and wait at the top\u201d Dan whispers, pointing down the alley beside the house. Phil nods and runs down the dark lane and up the stairs. Dan nods when he sees Phil at the top, crouching and hiding. </p><p>Dan then walks up to the front steps of the house, roses in hand and knocks on the large wooden door 3 times. Surprisingly within a few seconds, the door opens, and he is met with the taller man with stubble, dark brown messy hair and grey eyes. </p><p>\u201ch-hey Lewis\u2026\u201d Dan introduces himself. Lewis looks shocked, or more like Dan was an inconvenience.</p><p>\u201cDan? what the fuck are you doing here?\u201d He asks, looking around behind Dan for anyone else, acting suspiciously. </p><p>\u201cI wanted to give you these\u2026 i-i\u2019m sorry I upset you somehow, I just was hoping we could chat?\u201d Dan asks, handing him the roses. Lewis looks at him confused but sighs and opens the door more, letting Dan in.</p><p>\u201cthanks\u201d Dan replies, quickly and unnoticeably turning his earpiece on so Phil could hear. Dan walks up to the stairs to the living room and sits down, and Lewis does too.</p><p>\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be here, Dan. I told you we were through\u201d Lewis sighs.</p><p>\u201ci-i was hoping we could get back together actually\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I did wrong so I wanted to fix it for you so you would love me again\u2026\u201d Dan mumbles.</p><p>\u201cfucks sake, that\u2019s it? Is that all you wanted? Like I said, I don\u2019t want you anymore. You want to know why I don\u2019t? Because you\u2019re useless, pathetic even. Can\u2019t look after yourself when I\u2019m trying to do shit, and I got sick of it. I was supposed to do something in Paris, but you got in the way, so I left you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d Dan asks quietly, looking sadly into Lewis\u2019 eyes. </p><p>\u201cReally. now, I\u2019m meeting some people soon so you\u2019ll need to leave.\u201d Lewis stands up.</p><p>\u201cw-wait, let me at least put the roses in water. Let me be useful for once.\u201d Dan stands as well, picking up the roses and sitting Lewis back down on the couch, before walking out of the living room and to the kitchen. He closes the door behind him and rushes over to the window, throwing the roses on the bench and unlocking the window for Phil. </p><p>\u201che\u2019s meeting people soon, I think there are other terrorists we didn\u2019t know about\u201d Dan whispers when he opens the window.

Is that all you wanted? Like I said, I don\u2019t want you anymore. You want to know why I don\u2019t? Because you\u2019re useless, pathetic even. Can\u2019t look after yourself when I\u2019m trying to do shit, and I got sick of it. I was supposed to do something in Paris, but you got in the way, so I left you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201creally?\u201d Dan asks quietly, looking sadly into Lewis\u2019 eyes. </p><p>\u201cReally. now, I\u2019m meeting some people soon so you\u2019ll need to leave.\u201d Lewis stands up.</p><p>\u201cw-wait, let me at least put the roses in water. Let me be useful for once.\u201d Dan stands as well, picking up the roses and sitting Lewis back down on the couch, before walking out of the living room and to the kitchen. He closes the door behind him and rushes over to the window, throwing the roses on the bench and unlocking the window for Phil. </p><p>\u201che\u2019s meeting people soon, I think there are other terrorists we didn\u2019t know about\u201d Dan whispers when he opens the window. Phil pops his head up and groans.</p><p>\u201cI heard. Fuck. I don\u2019t think we can kill him just yet, especially if there are others. I\u2019ll text Q for potential backup\u201d Phil replies when he quietly steps into the kitchen while Dan closes the window. Dan then grabs a vase and fills it with water and unwraps the roses and puts them in the water while Phil texts Q. </p><p>Then he carries them out to the living room again where Lewis was waiting.</p><p>\u201chere\u201d Dan places them down on the dining table. \u201cuseful.\u201d </p><p>\u201cyeah, sure. Are you leaving now?\u201d Lewis asks. Dan laughs and walks over to him.</p><p>\u201cwhy do you want me gone so desperately, do you have a date or something coming over?\u201d Dan laughs, kissing his prickly cheek. </p><p>\u201cactually I have some very important friends coming over that I need to talk to so could you please leave now?\u201d Lewis asks. Just as Dan is about to answer, there\u2019s another knock at the door. Lewis groans and stands up. </p><p>\u201cthey\u2019re here. You need to go\u201d lewis groans in annoyance, grabbing Dan\u2019s arm and leading him downstairs.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, let me stay a little longer, maybe I could hook up with one of your mates\u201d Dan jokes, but Lewis doesn\u2019t laugh. They reach the door and lewis opens it, 3 men in black suits stand outside.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lewis, who\u2019s this?\u201d One asks. </p><p>\u201cthis is my ex, Dan, and he\u2019s leaving.\u201d Lewis pushes Dan out the door, but one of the men grabs him.</p><p>\u201cAww why\u2019d you dump him, he\u2019s pretty cute,\u201d they ask.</p><p>\u201cdoesn\u2019t matter, come inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwe aren\u2019t coming inside without him. No witnesses\u201d the other says. Suddenly Dan gets scared when he\u2019s lead back inside the house. </p><p>\u201cSo, Lewis. What happened with Paris?\u201d One of the men asks as they sit Dan back down on the couch.</p><p>\u201csomething came up\u201d Lewis replies. </p><p>\u201cdoes he know\u201d one points over at Dan. Lewis shakes his head no. </p><p>\u201cyou mean about your plan to have a terrorist attack?\u201d Dan asks, reaching behind his back for his gun. They all turn to him and look at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201chow do you know about that\u2026\u201d Lewis asks, Dan doesn\u2019t reply but quickly pulls the gun out and fires it at his foot and he screams out in pain. </p><p>The three men quickly grab him, and Dan screams out for Phil, kneeing one in the face and punching another in the neck to get out of their grasp. He is able to shoot another in the shoulder before someone wraps a hand around his face and holds a cloth to his mouth and nose. Dan fights against the grip but his eyes roll back into his head, and he drops to the floor unconscious. <br></p></p>",

He drags himself back to Phil&rsquo;s bedroom, kicking his shoes off and climbing under the sheets.</p><p>Phil watches the saddened boy slip away and sighs. He can&rsquo;t believe the news either, knowing just how heartbroken Dan feels. Deciding to try and comfort Dan, he puts the kettle on and makes them both a sweet cup of tea. When he walks into the room, he sees the lump in the duvet and places one of the cups down beside it on the bedside table. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I made you some tea&hellip;&rdquo; Phil whispers, stroking his hand up and down the lump before walking over to his side of the bed, placing his own cup down and climbing in himself.</p><p>&ldquo;did you want to talk about it?&rdquo; Phil asks softly. The sheets shuffle and arms wrap around his waist, a flushed face snuggles itself into his stomach and doesn&rsquo;t reply.</p><p>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to, I just thought&hellip; maybe talking about your problems is better than keeping them in&hellip;&rdquo; Phil mirrors what Dan had said two nights ago.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe he lied to me&rdquo; Dan replies quietly, sniffling a little.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either. I&rsquo;m so sorry, Dan. You don&rsquo;t have to do it, you know?&rdquo; Phil asks. The sheets shuffle, and Dan&rsquo;s wet cheeks and his face appears from under them.</p><p>&ldquo;I still want to&rdquo; he replies, sniffling and wiping his cheeks, letting out a trapped sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;w-what do you mean?&rdquo; Phil asks, a little shocked by the boy&rsquo;s mood change</p><p>&ldquo;I want to kill the son of a bitch myself. Sure I&rsquo;m upset, heartbroken even, but if the piece of shit needs to die for what he has done- I want to do it myself.&rdquo; Dan explains, suddenly jumping out of bed and walking out into the lounge. Phil quickly follows after him and watches him grab his phone and look something up.</p><p>&ldquo;are you sure? This is pretty heavy stuff-&ldquo; Phil comforts, but Dan shakes his head with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m upset. I&rsquo;m happy. I&rsquo;m going to make sure he sees my face when he dies because finally, he will realise that- t-that-&ldquo; and Dan starts breaking down again. He stands still, looking down at his phone and tears quickly rerun down his cheeks. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, hey Dan, come here&rdquo; Phil collects Dan his arms and lets him sob.</p><p>&ldquo;I just want him to suffer. H-he&rsquo;s a fucking terrorist! He&rsquo;s murdered people, innocent people! And fucking tricked me into thinking I was loved&hellip;&rdquo; Dan whimpers into Phil&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;but you are loved, Dan&hellip; by your mum, your dad, and me. Especially me, Dan. You didn&rsquo;t deserve someone so awful in your life, and I promise I will never be like that to you. You&rsquo;re so precious to me. If you want to go through with it, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo; Phil presses a soft kiss to Dan&rsquo;s damp cheek and continues hugging him. </p><p>&ldquo;thank you, Phil. I love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much too. Come on, let&rsquo;s go back to bed, and we will discuss our plan tomorrow&rdquo; Phil leads Dan back into the bedroom and makes sure he was comfortable before laying down and comforting the sad boy.</p><p>The next day comes quicker than expected. The two planned a set up to get Lewis in a vulnerable position, where he would least expect it. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go pick up the flowers before we leave, and you&rsquo;ll sneak in through the fire escape leading up to his kitchen. Keep the earpiece on, and I&rsquo;ll let you know if we are moving&rdquo; Dan explains, checking his pistols bullets and hiding one up the leg of his jeans and the other tucked in the back of his jeans and hidden under his loose black and white grid button up shirt. Phil dresses in some black pants and a free shirt also, his guns up his legs with his knife and extra ammo and of course, his glasses. </p><p>They leave soon after. Dan buys some red roses wrapped with cellophane and Phil follows as they arrive in the street that Lewis lives. </p><p>&ldquo;head down there, the fire escape is open and climb it and wait at the top&rdquo; Dan whispers, pointing down the alley beside the house. Phil nods and runs down the dark lane and up the stairs. Dan nods when he sees Phil at the top, crouching and hiding. </p><p>Dan then walks up to the front steps of the house, roses in hand and knocks on the large wooden door 3 times. Surprisingly within a few seconds, the door opens, and he is met with the taller man with stubble, dark brown messy hair and grey eyes. </p><p>&ldquo;h-hey Lewis&hellip;&rdquo; Dan introduces himself. Lewis looks shocked, or more like Dan was an inconvenience.</p><p>&ldquo;Dan? what the fuck are you doing here?&rdquo; He asks, looking around behind Dan for anyone else, acting suspiciously. </p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to give you these&hellip; i-i&rsquo;m sorry I upset you somehow, I just was hoping we could chat?&rdquo; Dan asks, handing him the roses. Lewis looks at him confused but sighs and opens the door more, letting Dan in.</p><p>&ldquo;thanks&rdquo; Dan replies, quickly and unnoticeably turning his earpiece on so Phil could hear. Dan walks up to the stairs to the living room and sits down, and Lewis does too.</p><p>&ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t be here, Dan. I told you we were through&rdquo; Lewis sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;i-i was hoping we could get back together actually&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what I did wrong so I wanted to fix it for you so you would love me again&hellip;&rdquo; Dan mumbles.</p><p>&ldquo;fucks sake, that&rsquo;s it?

I get the point you are trying to make, but I think it\u2019s important for the phandom to remember that Dan\u2019s family are actually people trying to live normal lives, not just extensions of him, and deserve to be able to have some privacy (which is why I\u2019m really opposed to people using them in their fan fictions, not to mention the crap people on IDB pull like using photoshop to read the message in a personal card to Dan from his mom).
