But here you go\u00a0</p><p>All day Harry had been\ndoing it. <i>All</i> damn day! It was your first holiday together and you and\nHarry had decided to host dinner. You had the recipes from your mother and his.\nYou followed the recipes to a \u2018T\u2019 ;however all day Harry kept interjecting.</p><p><i>\u201clets add a little brown sugar!\u201d,</i><i>\u201ctake the cookies out luv might burn the bottom,\ndon wan tha\u201d,</i><i>\u201cadd more salt not there yet kinda bland\u201d,</i><i>\u201cdice them smaller want the <u>taste</u> not the\n<u>chunks</u>\u201d, </i><i>\u201cYou have to baste it often or it would dry up\nup top\u201d, </i><i>\u201clets add this(wine) make the taste more bold!\u201d</i></p><p>And <i>now</i> he had just hip bumped you over\nto the side complaining the sauce was burning and you weren&rsquo;t stirring it fast\nenough turning down the \u00a0heat even after you said you got it he was still\nmicromanaging, taking over. You huffed grabbing a bottle of water from the\nfridge, before going up the stairs to get ready they were arriving in 2 hours\nyou were so angry you slam the door behind you. It was the slam that caught his\nattention quickly he jogged up the \u00a0stairs \u201cPet re yeh alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d you yell from inside the closet</p><p>\u201cWha\u2019 re yeh doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting ready!\u201d</p><p>\u201cK m gonna head down i added some red wine to\nthe sauce it tastes amazing!\u201d he said excitedly\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOk!\u201d you say disinterested. You wanted this to be perfect you wanted his\nfamily to know you could be a great home keeper and take care of him. More\nimportantly you wanted everyone to know you would be a great wife when the time\ncame but Harry proved you wrong. You worried that maybe his micromanaging was\nbecause you were a terrible home keeper the readjustment of pillows and table\nscaping on the dining table and trinkets around your shared home. He\nthought you didn&rsquo;t realize but you did, you thought nothing of it at first but,\nnow it was like a sign a subliminal loud bright neon sign \u2018you are shit at\nthis!\u2019</p><p>You get ready on a simple dress with a floor\nlength cardigan on.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asks walking into the bathroom</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d you answer</p><p>He wraps his arms around you \u201cwow babe yeh look\namazin\u2019 \u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThanks\u201d you say flatly pushing him off</p><p>\u00a0He doesn&rsquo;t catch on he&rsquo;s too excited.

Your pride is defeated. Nothing that you did went right and everyone knows you can&rsquo;t do much of anything. Your\nmom was relentless about your lack of cooking skills the alcohol getting to her\nwhich makes everyone laugh all night at you. When they start leaving you smile and say your\ngoodbyes kissing away any hopes of being Mrs. Styles \u00a0because there&rsquo;s no way Anne Twist is \u00a0going to let you marry her son not when you\ncouldn&rsquo;t even bake cookies!\u00a0</p><p>You rush to the kitchen to clean up the dishes.

More\nimportantly you wanted everyone to know you would be a great wife when the time\ncame but Harry proved you wrong. You worried that maybe his micromanaging was\nbecause you were a terrible home keeper the readjustment of pillows and table\nscaping on the dining table and trinkets around your shared home.

He could\napologize plus your cooking wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> bad. He had no time to think of\nother ideas because he was to be at the studio soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though he was in the\nstudio his mind drifted to you often so he snuck away to call you.&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; &nbsp;you answer&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi butterfly&rdquo; he speaks softly&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi Harry&rdquo; you greet. &ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; he never\ncalls when he&rsquo;s in the studio</p><p>&ldquo;Yea&hellip;.hows your day?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrug &ldquo;just work..&rdquo; its awkward &ldquo;how&rsquo;s\nyours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good ok i guess&hellip; can we talk bout last\nnight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; you say in a flat tone</p><p>&ldquo;Come on pet i&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You interrupt him &ldquo;im not talking about it so if\nyou have nothing to say im hanging up&rdquo; you&rsquo;re beyond irritated&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&hellip; &nbsp;he &nbsp;remained \nsilent &ldquo;Y/N&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rdquo; your tone &nbsp;warns him</p><p>He feels worse &ldquo;pet please&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go back you have things to do&rdquo; you reason &nbsp;&ldquo;see you at home I love you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed deeply &ldquo;love you too&rdquo;&nbsp;He did his best rushed through songs. You\nhowever didn&rsquo;t get &nbsp;home till late and you met a sleeping Harry. You did\nyour best to be silent and sneak into bed but he felt the dip in the mattress.</p><p>&ldquo;Pet?&rdquo; he asks turning his head to face you&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes good night&rdquo; you say &nbsp;kissing his lips\nand laying &nbsp;down</p><p>He sighs turning on his lamp &ldquo;Y/N&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go back to sleep Harry&rdquo; you stress&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No not good night!&rdquo; he says turning you around\nto face him &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re gonna talk about this whether yeh like it or not!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry&rdquo; you fuss</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously over dinner?&rdquo; You look at him with a blank &nbsp;face &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even do anything was jus&rsquo; trying to\nhelp I&rsquo;m sorry if i offended yeh&rdquo; now he was the one that was irritated &nbsp;You still say nothing as he is looking at you\nfor a response&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeh could have said yeh cooked i wouldn&rsquo;t have\nminded its just food!&rdquo; You still give him a blank stare &ldquo;Oh for the luv of! Bloody say something!&rdquo; he\ncommands&nbsp;</p><p>You sigh and turn to look at the ceiling &ldquo;it\nwasn&rsquo;t a stupid dinner maybe to you it was but it meant more than that to me&rdquo;\nyou feel the tears well up. &ldquo;I was supposed to make it perfect the whole house\nbut you kept <i>fixing</i> things.&rdquo; The first &nbsp;tear rolled down your face\n&ldquo;then you wouldn&rsquo;t let me cook i had the recipes i was doing exactly what was\nwritten down. Then here you come correcting and adding shit. You undermined <i>everything\n</i>i did that day, like you didn&rsquo;t trust that i could make anything good\nenough for your family.&rdquo; You now dig the heels of your hands to your eyes\ntrying to stop the flow</p><p>&ldquo;Pet&rdquo; he said softly feeling awful about his\nactions&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What mother wants her son to be with a woman\nwho can&rsquo;t even cook Harry?!&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>He frowned &ldquo;my mum&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t even let me pour a glass of wine!&rdquo;</p><p>He remained silent &ldquo;I blew my chances&rdquo; you turn over &ldquo;good night Harry&rdquo;</p><p>He goes to open his mouth but can&rsquo;t find the\nright words any words to make things better</p><p>You sigh when you feel him lay back down wiping your tears</p><p>The next morning it&rsquo;s Friday and you drag your\nbody out of bed before the alarm goes off not like you slept, you have been battling\na tension headache. You get ready and go to the kitchen and make Harry&rsquo;s\nsmoothie before leaving resuming your routine. You go back upstairs and &nbsp;push his hair out\nof his face he shifts around &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; you whisper before kissing his\ncheek signaling his que to wake-up and you&rsquo;re out the door. At work your productive enough so you leave\nearly. Your headache finally calmed down after 4 Advil pills. You grab your\nthings and drive home it&rsquo;s 2 o'clock so Harry should still be in the studio.\nWhen you pull up to your driveway you don&rsquo;t see his car so you sigh in relief,\nyou did &nbsp;not wish to recap last night your emotions got the best of you,\nyou don&rsquo;t even know why you complained about the wine situation he always\npoured wine for your guests.&nbsp;</p><p>As you walk in the door however you almost\nfreeze seeing Harry sitting by the couch listening to his music writing.</p><p>&ldquo;Pet home early!&rdquo; he says with a smile on his\nface&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea got finished early&rdquo; you speak softly &ldquo;why\nare you home? thought you had studio time&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh Jeff &lsquo;nd I got into a heated discussion&rdquo; he\njokes &ldquo;thought it&rsquo;d be best if we cooled off&rdquo; He was lying he spent all day at\nhome waiting for you making calls and the fact that you were early made it\nperfect because now you couldn&rsquo;t say no. &ldquo;Glad yeh&rsquo;r home early! Would like to\ntake yeh on a date&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; you ask suspicious of his motives&nbsp;</p><p>He stands up &ldquo;Yeh&rsquo;r my girlfriend and its been 2\nweeks too long&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh i didn&rsquo;t mean like that sorry&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; worry bout it&hellip;So can i?&rdquo; he asks you&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What am i supposed to wear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything yeh look amazing in anything!&rdquo; he\nsmiles&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea but i don&rsquo;t know, &nbsp;where we are\ngoing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A cute dress!&rdquo; he solved your riddle&nbsp;</p><p>You nod walking away. He hates the fact that you had become insecure\nabout <i>everything</i>. You stood there with your puppy eyes and slightly pouty\nlip playing nervously with your fingers looking at him which was killing him to\nnot hug you and give you reassuring kisses. You take 2 hours to get ready the outfit was the\nissue finally deciding on a bodycon maxi dress and you threw your hair up into\na low messy updo.</p><p>You walk down the stairs barefoot &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Harry asks&nbsp;</p><p>You shake your head &ldquo;which shoes?&rdquo; you ask\n&nbsp;holding up 2 pairs of heel sandals</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm&rdquo; &nbsp;he smiles tapping his lip and\nstands up walking over to you he looks at them &ldquo;try them on let me see&rdquo; he\nanalyzes and judges and picks his favorite&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok\nready&rdquo; you say after putting on the shoes&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You look amazing as always&rdquo; he compliments&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; You drive in silence to a high end Restaurant on\nthe rooftop &nbsp;of a tower down town You already know what you want as you both skim\nthe menu but right now going over every single item included in each meal is\nbetter than addressing the issue. He clears his throat and you look up and smile.\nHe places his hand on the table and you gently place yours in his.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So..&rdquo; he begins He is interrupted by the waiter&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to\nBequoia! &nbsp;Would you like to try our Cabernet?&rdquo; &nbsp;<br /></p><p>\nHarry answers &ldquo;Yes we would thank you!&rdquo; He walked away and returned promptly &ldquo;Do you know what you would like?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Salmon&rdquo; you say&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Steak&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;How would you like that cooked sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Medium&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ok I will have that right out for you&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Can yeh also bring another bottle of Cabernet\nplease?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;He looked at you and rubbed the back of your\nhand with his thumb &ldquo;Pet i apologize for how i behaved&rdquo; You smile &ldquo;S not that i didn&rsquo;t think yeh would be good\nenough its a problem of mine&rsquo;nd if yeh want i will eat all your cooking!&rdquo; he\noffers up a smile to make you feel better You barely smile in response &ldquo;Never meant to. I just have a serious\nproblem&hellip; perfectionist.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Its ok Harry, shouldn&rsquo;t have been so sensitive&rdquo; &nbsp;you say softly and wipe\nyour tears away&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;No its not pet&rdquo; he moves towards you &ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry\nplease don&rsquo;t cry&rdquo; he wraps his arm around you pulling you closer You nod and fight against the tears&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Im sorry pet please&rdquo; he begs</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok Harry you apologized&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re crying&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>You giggle &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m weird&rdquo;&nbsp;you joke&nbsp;</p>",

But hope you enjoy + it ain\u2019t\nproof-read so yeah.</b></i></p><p>It\u2019s been over three month since Harry met Y/N at Zonko\u2019s and since then Harry\nhadn\u2019t stopped calling her or texting her. Harry knew he was being annoying but\nhe couldn\u2019t stop, he couldn\u2019t let her walk out of his life yet again.</p><p>Harry had even showed up at her place few times but those were nothing but a\nslam of the door on his face. However, the first time he showed up, she had\nactually listened to what he had to say but when he started to show up often\nshe started to shut the door as soon as she saw it was him. He even spent two\nnights at the porch sitting; eventually falling asleep on the small sofa she\nhad outside. The next morning he hadn\u2019t actually met Y/N at all she had gone to\nwork while he was asleep. However, he did get a sandwich and a bottle of orange\njuice along with a note which just told him to stop disturbing her and he was\nbeing pathetic. Harry already knew he was being pathetic, but he didn\u2019t stop,\nhe couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Harry knew he was creating problems in her relation with some \u2018Jake\u2019 but he\ndidn\u2019t care and if he was honest he was kind of happy about it. He knew, he was\nbeing selfish but he truly didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t usually like this, he wasn\u2019t\nsomeone who\u2019d break someone else\u2019s relation just so he could be with his love\nbut over time Harry realized Y/N wanted to be with him too, she just didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Jake out of courtesy. Harry still remembered what she said when\nhe first showed up at her place.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I can\u2019t,\u201d she had tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m with Jake\nand I can\u2019t just leave him because you decided to show up after a year.\u201d</p><p>The desperation present in her voice and the need in her eyes was enough to\ntell Harry she wanted to be with him too.</p><p>Harry had even accidentally talked to Jake. Jake had picked up Y/N\u2019s phone\nonce and told him to call back after a while because Y/N was in shower. Harry\nhad curiously asked who he was and he told him he was Jake, Y/N\u2019s boyfriend.\nBefore Harry could say anything else Jake somehow realized he was the one who\nwas texting and sending flowers to his girlfriend. The next thing he did was to\ntell Harry to back off, but he never did.</p><p>Harry threw his phone on the couch before going to the kitchen for getting\nsome wine. He had just called Y/N and then sent two texts afterwards, telling\nher he loved her and he was never going to give up.</p><p>Harry took out the wine from the fridge and made his way back to living\nroom. It was raining heavily then, Harry plopped down on his couch. He checked\nhis phone in hope of a reply from Y/N but she hadn\u2019t just like every other\ntime. Harry sighed before turning the TV on.</p><p>Harry was mindlessly watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S, while thinking about Y/N when\nhe heard his door bell rang. Harry slowly got up from the couch and went\ntowards the door having no idea who it\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Harry yelled when the person behind the door impatiently\nrang his bell non-stop.</p><p>\u201cComing, coming, coming,\u201d Harry made a small jog towards the door\nand opened it finally making the person stop abusing the bell. However, before\nHarry could even see the person, something was thrown at his face. He looked\ndown at his hand which now carried a bouquet of flowers. Harry realized it was\nthe bouquet he had sent Y/N that morning.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole! He broke up with me!\u201d It was Y/N.</p><p>Harry was shocked to see her there, with water dripping from her raven hair,\nsweater soaked and boots filled with water. But as much he was shocked, he was\never so happy.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna just look at my face or would you say something!\u201d\nY/N yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah - I\u2019m sorry?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, in fact a small\nsmile tugged itself on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking smiling!\u201d Y/N yelled furiously throwing her hands\nin the air. \u201cHe told me he couldn\u2019t be with me if my ex keeps sending me\nflowers and call me all the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry forced a frown on his face. \u201cCome in,\nyou\u2019re wet,\u201d he opened the door further and stepped aside for her to get\nin.</p><p>Y/N stomped in throwing her boots off. \u201cYou know you\u2019re fucking\nselfish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I told you that but you never really listened,\u201d Harry\nsaid timidly.</p><p>\u201cGod Harry, I wanna punch you in the face! At first you tell me some\nshits and make me leave, then you realize what you said after a whole damn year\nand then you make my boyfriend leave! For fucks sake I don\u2019t know what to\nfucking do!\u201d Y/N exclaimed pulling her hair slightly as tears appeared on\nher face.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Harry tried to calm her putting a hand on her shoulder but\nshe quickly pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, why\nthings have to happen when you fucking want! When you thought you didn\u2019t need\nme, you tossed me aside like a toy and when you felt like you needed me, you\nwent crazy and just created a situation where my boyfriend had no option but to\nleave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Harry was cut off.</p><p>\u201c'It\u2019s not true\u2019, you say! Then what is? You fucking- ugh you fucking\ndidn\u2019t even call me. If I mean so much to you then why didn\u2019t you fucking call\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you, Y/N. But your phone was off,\u201d Harry argued but he\ndidn\u2019t raise his voice, he didn\u2019t have the right - he knew that.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, three days, alright 7 days, after that? I was with you for\nfive years, we were friends for two years before that, I at least deserved one\nmonth waiting, didn\u2019t I?

Only if he\ncalled her tried to get her back, back then they wouldn\u2019t have in this\nsituation. Y/N would\u2019ve been with him this whole time. But he didn\u2019t, he just\nforgot her. Harry still didn\u2019t know how he managed to do that and how he\nmanaged to live over a year without her.</p><p>\u201cY/N I know I was an asshole and I\u2019m truly sorry about what I\ndid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t fucking cut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019ll do whatever to make you forgive me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much you know that,\u201d Y/N looked down as the tears\nran down her already wet cheek.</p><p>\u201cLove you don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Harry knew it but that didn\u2019t stop his\nheart to drop. Harry hated himself. He truly messed up and he can never forgive\nhimself for making her feel like that.</p><p>Harry scooted closure to Y/N and wrapped his arm around Y/N\u2019s shaking form. Harry\nabsolutely hated to see Y/N cry but knowing it was for him, he just want dug a\nhole in the ground and disappear, but he had to make things right with her. He\nloved her and he was not going to let her go like the last time.</p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d Harry was taken off guard as Y/N threw her arms over his\nshoulder as a huge sob racked through her body. Harry didn\u2019t waste any time to\nwrap his arms around her. Harry could feel his whole body getting wet for Y/N\u2019s\nclothes but he didn\u2019t care. He put his chin over Y/N\u2019s head as he kept mumbling\nhow sorry he was and how much he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much and it felt like you completely forgot me, it\nfelt as if you didn\u2019t even know I ever existed,\u201d Y/N sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Harry said as he felt his own tear falling.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Y/N pulled the collar of his t-shirt\nlooking at him desperately; tears running down; eyes puffy; nose red and cheek\nflushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d He looked down at her. His heart\nbroke seeing her like that and knowing he caused it, he felt his heart\nshattering</p><p>Y/N let go of his collars as she buried her face in her hand. Harry quickly\npulled her closure to him and rocked her back and forth as she continued to\ncry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Y/N said after a while. Her sobs died down as she sat\nstraight. Y/N wiped her face with her sweater sleeve, even thought it was wet\nitself and looked up at Harry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance, but we are not in a relation or anything -\nnot even friends. We\u2019re starting from the very beginning. And I swear, if you\nbreak my heart again Harry, you\u2019ll never see my face ever again,\u201d Y/N said\nsternly making a huge grin appear on Harry face.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, thank you so much!\u201d Harry hugged Y/N again. \u201cI\nwon\u2019t let you down this time, I promise.\u201d</p>",

But hope you enjoy + it ain\u2019t\nproof-read so yeah.</b></i></p><p>It\u2019s been over three month since Harry met Y/N at Zonko\u2019s and since then Harry\nhadn\u2019t stopped calling her or texting her. Harry knew he was being annoying but\nhe couldn\u2019t stop, he couldn\u2019t let her walk out of his life yet again.</p><p>Harry had even showed up at her place few times but those were nothing but a\nslam of the door on his face. However, the first time he showed up, she had\nactually listened to what he had to say but when he started to show up often\nshe started to shut the door as soon as she saw it was him. He even spent two\nnights at the porch sitting; eventually falling asleep on the small sofa she\nhad outside. The next morning he hadn\u2019t actually met Y/N at all she had gone to\nwork while he was asleep. However, he did get a sandwich and a bottle of orange\njuice along with a note which just told him to stop disturbing her and he was\nbeing pathetic. Harry already knew he was being pathetic, but he didn\u2019t stop,\nhe couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Harry knew he was creating problems in her relation with some \u2018Jake\u2019 but he\ndidn\u2019t care and if he was honest he was kind of happy about it. He knew, he was\nbeing selfish but he truly didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t usually like this, he wasn\u2019t\nsomeone who\u2019d break someone else\u2019s relation just so he could be with his love\nbut over time Harry realized Y/N wanted to be with him too, she just didn\u2019t\nwant to leave Jake out of courtesy. Harry still remembered what she said when\nhe first showed up at her place.</p><p>\u201cHarry, I can\u2019t,\u201d she had tears in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m with Jake\nand I can\u2019t just leave him because you decided to show up after a year.\u201d</p><p>The desperation present in her voice and the need in her eyes was enough to\ntell Harry she wanted to be with him too.</p><p>Harry had even accidentally talked to Jake. Jake had picked up Y/N\u2019s phone\nonce and told him to call back after a while because Y/N was in shower. Harry\nhad curiously asked who he was and he told him he was Jake, Y/N\u2019s boyfriend.\nBefore Harry could say anything else Jake somehow realized he was the one who\nwas texting and sending flowers to his girlfriend. The next thing he did was to\ntell Harry to back off, but he never did.</p><p>Harry threw his phone on the couch before going to the kitchen for getting\nsome wine. He had just called Y/N and then sent two texts afterwards, telling\nher he loved her and he was never going to give up.</p><p>Harry took out the wine from the fridge and made his way back to living\nroom. It was raining heavily then, Harry plopped down on his couch. He checked\nhis phone in hope of a reply from Y/N but she hadn\u2019t just like every other\ntime. Harry sighed before turning the TV on.</p><p>Harry was mindlessly watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S, while thinking about Y/N when\nhe heard his door bell rang. Harry slowly got up from the couch and went\ntowards the door having no idea who it\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Harry yelled when the person behind the door impatiently\nrang his bell non-stop.</p><p>\u201cComing, coming, coming,\u201d Harry made a small jog towards the door\nand opened it finally making the person stop abusing the bell. However, before\nHarry could even see the person, something was thrown at his face. He looked\ndown at his hand which now carried a bouquet of flowers. Harry realized it was\nthe bouquet he had sent Y/N that morning.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole! He broke up with me!\u201d It was Y/N.</p><p>Harry was shocked to see her there, with water dripping from her raven hair,\nsweater soaked and boots filled with water. But as much he was shocked, he was\never so happy.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna just look at my face or would you say something!\u201d\nY/N yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah - I\u2019m sorry?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, in fact a small\nsmile tugged itself on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking smiling!\u201d Y/N yelled furiously throwing her hands\nin the air. \u201cHe told me he couldn\u2019t be with me if my ex keeps sending me\nflowers and call me all the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry forced a frown on his face. \u201cCome in,\nyou\u2019re wet,\u201d he opened the door further and stepped aside for her to get\nin.</p><p>Y/N stomped in throwing her boots off. \u201cYou know you\u2019re fucking\nselfish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I told you that but you never really listened,\u201d Harry\nsaid timidly.</p><p>\u201cGod Harry, I wanna punch you in the face! At first you tell me some\nshits and make me leave, then you realize what you said after a whole damn year\nand then you make my boyfriend leave! For fucks sake I don\u2019t know what to\nfucking do!\u201d Y/N exclaimed pulling her hair slightly as tears appeared on\nher face.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Harry tried to calm her putting a hand on her shoulder but\nshe quickly pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, why\nthings have to happen when you fucking want! When you thought you didn\u2019t need\nme, you tossed me aside like a toy and when you felt like you needed me, you\nwent crazy and just created a situation where my boyfriend had no option but to\nleave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Harry was cut off.</p><p>\u201c'It\u2019s not true\u2019, you say! Then what is? You fucking- ugh you fucking\ndidn\u2019t even call me. If I mean so much to you then why didn\u2019t you fucking call\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you, Y/N. But your phone was off,\u201d Harry argued but he\ndidn\u2019t raise his voice, he didn\u2019t have the right - he knew that.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, three days, alright 7 days, after that? I was with you for\nfive years, we were friends for two years before that, I at least deserved one\nmonth waiting, didn\u2019t I? But you were making out with that French model after\nliterally two weeks,\u201d Y/N chuckled. \u201cI was stupid to think I meant at\nleast something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N you mean everything to me,\u201d Harry said desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make me feel like it, you just made me feel like a toy, you\nused me then threw me away!\u201d Y/N said again. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I even\ncame here.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was about to walk out again but Harry sprinted after and pulled her by\nher arm, but he made sure he wasn\u2019t hurting.</p><p>He won\u2019t let her walk away yet again.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Y/N said trying free herself from his grip, but his\ngrip was firm.</p><p>\u201cPlease, hear me out!\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI heard you at Zonko\u2019s,\u201d she argued, still trying to set herself\nfree from his grip.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry said loosening his grip, he didn\u2019t want to make\nher feel uncomfortable in any way possible, \u201cJust, please - can you seat\ndown for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Y/N said nothing but she made her way to his sofa and sat down hugging\nherself, the wet clothes were making her feel cold.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna change?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied curtly.</p><p>Harry sighed and sat down next to her.</p><p>It was his fault really, and he was paying for what he did.

But as much he was shocked, he was\never so happy.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna just look at my face or would you say something!\u201d\nY/N yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah - I\u2019m sorry?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sorry at all, in fact a small\nsmile tugged itself on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking smiling!\u201d Y/N yelled furiously throwing her hands\nin the air. \u201cHe told me he couldn\u2019t be with me if my ex keeps sending me\nflowers and call me all the time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry forced a frown on his face. \u201cCome in,\nyou\u2019re wet,\u201d he opened the door further and stepped aside for her to get\nin.</p><p>Y/N stomped in throwing her boots off. \u201cYou know you\u2019re fucking\nselfish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I told you that but you never really listened,\u201d Harry\nsaid timidly.</p><p>\u201cGod Harry, I wanna punch you in the face! At first you tell me some\nshits and make me leave, then you realize what you said after a whole damn year\nand then you make my boyfriend leave! For fucks sake I don\u2019t know what to\nfucking do!\u201d Y/N exclaimed pulling her hair slightly as tears appeared on\nher face.</p><p>\u201cY/N,\u201d Harry tried to calm her putting a hand on her shoulder but\nshe quickly pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me!!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, why\nthings have to happen when you fucking want! When you thought you didn\u2019t need\nme, you tossed me aside like a toy and when you felt like you needed me, you\nwent crazy and just created a situation where my boyfriend had no option but to\nleave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d Harry was cut off.</p><p>\u201c'It\u2019s not true\u2019, you say! Then what is? You fucking- ugh you fucking\ndidn\u2019t even call me. If I mean so much to you then why didn\u2019t you fucking call\nme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you, Y/N. But your phone was off,\u201d Harry argued but he\ndidn\u2019t raise his voice, he didn\u2019t have the right - he knew that.</p><p>\u201cTwo days, three days, alright 7 days, after that? I was with you for\nfive years, we were friends for two years before that, I at least deserved one\nmonth waiting, didn\u2019t I? But you were making out with that French model after\nliterally two weeks,\u201d Y/N chuckled. \u201cI was stupid to think I meant at\nleast something to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY/N you mean everything to me,\u201d Harry said desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make me feel like it, you just made me feel like a toy, you\nused me then threw me away!\u201d Y/N said again. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I even\ncame here.\u201d</p><p>Y/N was about to walk out again but Harry sprinted after and pulled her by\nher arm, but he made sure he wasn\u2019t hurting.</p><p>He won\u2019t let her walk away yet again.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Y/N said trying free herself from his grip, but his\ngrip was firm.</p><p>\u201cPlease, hear me out!\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cI heard you at Zonko\u2019s,\u201d she argued, still trying to set herself\nfree from his grip.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry said loosening his grip, he didn\u2019t want to make\nher feel uncomfortable in any way possible, \u201cJust, please - can you seat\ndown for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Y/N said nothing but she made her way to his sofa and sat down hugging\nherself, the wet clothes were making her feel cold.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna change?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied curtly.</p><p>Harry sighed and sat down next to her.</p><p>It was his fault really, and he was paying for what he did. Only if he\ncalled her tried to get her back, back then they wouldn\u2019t have in this\nsituation. Y/N would\u2019ve been with him this whole time. But he didn\u2019t, he just\nforgot her. Harry still didn\u2019t know how he managed to do that and how he\nmanaged to live over a year without her.</p><p>\u201cY/N I know I was an asshole and I\u2019m truly sorry about what I\ndid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry doesn\u2019t fucking cut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019ll do whatever to make you forgive me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much you know that,\u201d Y/N looked down as the tears\nran down her already wet cheek.</p><p>\u201cLove you don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Harry knew it but that didn\u2019t stop his\nheart to drop. Harry hated himself. He truly messed up and he can never forgive\nhimself for making her feel like that.</p><p>Harry scooted closure to Y/N and wrapped his arm around Y/N\u2019s shaking form. Harry\nabsolutely hated to see Y/N cry but knowing it was for him, he just want dug a\nhole in the ground and disappear, but he had to make things right with her. He\nloved her and he was not going to let her go like the last time.</p><p>\u201cY/N-\u201d Harry was taken off guard as Y/N threw her arms over his\nshoulder as a huge sob racked through her body. Harry didn\u2019t waste any time to\nwrap his arms around her. Harry could feel his whole body getting wet for Y/N\u2019s\nclothes but he didn\u2019t care. He put his chin over Y/N\u2019s head as he kept mumbling\nhow sorry he was and how much he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much and it felt like you completely forgot me, it\nfelt as if you didn\u2019t even know I ever existed,\u201d Y/N sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Harry said as he felt his own tear falling.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Y/N pulled the collar of his t-shirt\nlooking at him desperately; tears running down; eyes puffy; nose red and cheek\nflushed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d He looked down at her. His heart\nbroke seeing her like that and knowing he caused it, he felt his heart\nshattering</p><p>Y/N let go of his collars as she buried her face in her hand. Harry quickly\npulled her closure to him and rocked her back and forth as she continued to\ncry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Y/N said after a while. Her sobs died down as she sat\nstraight. Y/N wiped her face with her sweater sleeve, even thought it was wet\nitself and looked up at Harry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance, but we are not in a relation or anything -\nnot even friends. We\u2019re starting from the very beginning. And I swear, if you\nbreak my heart again Harry, you\u2019ll never see my face ever again,\u201d Y/N said\nsternly making a huge grin appear on Harry face.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, thank you so much!\u201d Harry hugged Y/N again. \u201cI\nwon\u2019t let you down this time, I promise.\u201d</p>",

But hope you enjoy + it ain&rsquo;t\nproof-read so yeah.</b></i></p><p>It&rsquo;s been over three month since Harry met Y/N at Zonko&rsquo;s and since then Harry\nhadn&rsquo;t stopped calling her or texting her. Harry knew he was being annoying but\nhe couldn&rsquo;t stop, he couldn&rsquo;t let her walk out of his life yet again.</p><p>Harry had even showed up at her place few times but those were nothing but a\nslam of the door on his face. However, the first time he showed up, she had\nactually listened to what he had to say but when he started to show up often\nshe started to shut the door as soon as she saw it was him. He even spent two\nnights at the porch sitting; eventually falling asleep on the small sofa she\nhad outside. The next morning he hadn&rsquo;t actually met Y/N at all she had gone to\nwork while he was asleep. However, he did get a sandwich and a bottle of orange\njuice along with a note which just told him to stop disturbing her and he was\nbeing pathetic. Harry already knew he was being pathetic, but he didn&rsquo;t stop,\nhe couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>Harry knew he was creating problems in her relation with some &lsquo;Jake&rsquo; but he\ndidn&rsquo;t care and if he was honest he was kind of happy about it. He knew, he was\nbeing selfish but he truly didn&rsquo;t care. He wasn&rsquo;t usually like this, he wasn&rsquo;t\nsomeone who&rsquo;d break someone else&rsquo;s relation just so he could be with his love\nbut over time Harry realized Y/N wanted to be with him too, she just didn&rsquo;t\nwant to leave Jake out of courtesy. Harry still remembered what she said when\nhe first showed up at her place.</p><p>&ldquo;Harry, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she had tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with Jake\nand I can&rsquo;t just leave him because you decided to show up after a year.&rdquo;</p><p>The desperation present in her voice and the need in her eyes was enough to\ntell Harry she wanted to be with him too.</p><p>Harry had even accidentally talked to Jake. Jake had picked up Y/N&rsquo;s phone\nonce and told him to call back after a while because Y/N was in shower. Harry\nhad curiously asked who he was and he told him he was Jake, Y/N&rsquo;s boyfriend.\nBefore Harry could say anything else Jake somehow realized he was the one who\nwas texting and sending flowers to his girlfriend. The next thing he did was to\ntell Harry to back off, but he never did.</p><p>Harry threw his phone on the couch before going to the kitchen for getting\nsome wine. He had just called Y/N and then sent two texts afterwards, telling\nher he loved her and he was never going to give up.</p><p>Harry took out the wine from the fridge and made his way back to living\nroom. It was raining heavily then, Harry plopped down on his couch. He checked\nhis phone in hope of a reply from Y/N but she hadn&rsquo;t just like every other\ntime. Harry sighed before turning the TV on.</p><p>Harry was mindlessly watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S, while thinking about Y/N when\nhe heard his door bell rang. Harry slowly got up from the couch and went\ntowards the door having no idea who it&rsquo;d be.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Harry yelled when the person behind the door impatiently\nrang his bell non-stop.</p><p>&ldquo;Coming, coming, coming,&rdquo; Harry made a small jog towards the door\nand opened it finally making the person stop abusing the bell. However, before\nHarry could even see the person, something was thrown at his face. He looked\ndown at his hand which now carried a bouquet of flowers. Harry realized it was\nthe bouquet he had sent Y/N that morning.</p><p>&ldquo;You asshole! He broke up with me!&rdquo; It was Y/N.</p><p>Harry was shocked to see her there, with water dripping from her raven hair,\nsweater soaked and boots filled with water. But as much he was shocked, he was\never so happy.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna just look at my face or would you say something!&rdquo;\nY/N yelled.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah - I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t sorry at all, in fact a small\nsmile tugged itself on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking smiling!&rdquo; Y/N yelled furiously throwing her hands\nin the air. &ldquo;He told me he couldn&rsquo;t be with me if my ex keeps sending me\nflowers and call me all the time!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Harry forced a frown on his face. &ldquo;Come in,\nyou&rsquo;re wet,&rdquo; he opened the door further and stepped aside for her to get\nin.</p><p>Y/N stomped in throwing her boots off. &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re fucking\nselfish!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I told you that but you never really listened,&rdquo; Harry\nsaid timidly.</p><p>&ldquo;God Harry, I wanna punch you in the face!
