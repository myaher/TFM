Gemma sat in the middle of\nyou and Anne, with an arm around both of you. There was not a dry eye\nin the car. You couldn&rsquo;t bare to look at Anne, knowing that if you\ndid you would break down ten times as worse.</p><p>The\ndrive to the airport seemed to take forever, as the driver dove in\nand out of traffic.

He would never leave you.\u201d</p><p>Her\nwords were little comfort, as the plane started to take off. It took\nabout an hour for the plane to touch back down.

There were cops everywhere, holding back fans. You\ndidn&rsquo;t have time to think about that though. Rushing through the\ndoors, you were escorted to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. Stepping out of\nthe elevator, a doctor approached your group.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\nyou must be here for Mr. Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nI&rsquo;m his mother, this is his sister and his girlfriend. How is he? Can\nwe see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\nIm Dr. Jackson. Harry was in a very serious car accident. He was\nbanged up pretty badly. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any internal damage,\nbut he did break his left arm which will eventually need surgery. But\nother than that he should be okay. He&rsquo;s going to be extremely sore\nfor the next week or so, so make sure he gets plenty of rest. He&rsquo;s\nresting now, but your more than welcome to go in and see him. He&rsquo;s in\nsuite 320.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou doctor!\u201d You all said at once.</p><p>Walking\ndown the hallway, hand in hand, you looked for Harry&rsquo;s room. Once\nthere, you took a deep breath. Anne was the first one to walk through\nthe door, followed by Gemma. It took you a moment to gather up enough\nstrength to walk through the door.</p><p>Once\nyou could, you slowly made your way into the room. Harry was laid out\non the bed asleep. He had cuts and bruises everywhere and his left\narm was in a cast. Seeing the cast an idea came to you.</p><p>\u201cDoes\nanyone have a Sharpie I could use?\u201d You asked around.</p><p>Jeff,\nwho was seated next to Harry stood up, \u201cI&rsquo;ll go find you one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you gonna do?\u201d asked Gemma.</p><p>\u201cScrew\na surprise party, I&rsquo;m gonna tell him now.\u201d You told her smiling.\nHer answering smile was encouraging.</p><p>Anne\nhad moved to sit in the chair beside Harry. \u201cI think that&rsquo;s a\nmarvelous idea dear.\u201d She said softly.</p><p>Jeff\ncame back in the room holding his treasure in his hands. \u201cI found\none!\u201d He exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d you told him as you took the silver sharpie from him.</p><p>Kneeling\nover, you started to wrote on Harry&rsquo;s cast.

Putting your hand over\nhis heart to make sure he was still there, you drifted off\npeacefully.</p><p>A\nfew hours had past before he began to stir. You axiomatically\nresponded and were wide awake.</p><p>\u201cHey\nthere sleepy head.\u201d You said smiling at him lovingly.</p><p>\u201cY/n?,\nWhen did you get here?

Things have been\ngoing great between the two of you. He was like a dream come true, a\nreal prince charming. You couldn\u2019t see your life without him, and\ncouldn\u2019t wait for the day that you became Mrs. Harry Styles.</p><p>Harry\nwas currently on tour, and you missed him terribly. To filled the\nvoid, you spent most days with your friends. You even spent a lot of\ntime with Harry\u2019s family. Ann adored you, and you and Gemma had\nbecome like sisters. It really helped to have them close by, on the\ndays that became unbearably lonely.</p><p>You\nwere on the way to \u00a0have lunch with them both. Harry was set to come\non in a few days, and you had some wonderful news to share. You\nwanted their input on how to surprise Harry with the news.</p><p>Entering\nthe restaurant, you found them right away. You told the Host who you\nwere, and he escorted you to the table.</p><p>\u201cY/n!,\nIt\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d Gemma gushed giving you a hug.</p><p>\u201cYou\nlook lovely my dear,\u201d Anna said, as you hugged her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\nmissed you both! I\u2019m so glad you were able to come today. How have\nyou been?\u201d</p><p>They\nboth dived deep into conversation. You all carried on, talking about\nthe things you had been up to and what was new in life. You found it\nquite easy to talk to them about most anything.</p><p>As you\nwere all finishing up on your meal, you sat back and looked at them.\n\u201cSooo I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re both wondering why I asked you to lunch\ntoday.\u201d They nodded their heads and urged you to continue. \u201cWell\nI need your help in something.

Handing them both a card, you\nlooked at them with a huge smile on your face. As they opened the\ncard, you waited for their reaction.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d\nGemma screamed first. \u201cAre you really?\u201d She asked excited.</p><p>You\nsimply nodded your head, and she screamed and reached across the\ntable to hug you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna be a grandma!\u201d Anne cried.</p><p>\u201cYou\nare,\u201d you informed her smiling.</p><p>She\nhad tears rolling down her face, as she too reached over to hug you\nonce more.</p><p>\u201cThere\nis one more thing though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re\nhaving twins.\u201d You said excited.</p><p>They\nboth gasped and cheered with you.</p><p>\u201cWell\nthe more the merrier,\u201d Anne declared.</p><p>\u201cNow,\nyou just have to help me surprise Harry. I want to do something big!\u201d</p><p>They\nboth eagerly starting spilling out ideas.</p><p>\u201cOhh\nwe could go to his concert and have them project it on the monitors!\u201d\nGemma offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\nnot sure he would want the public to know about it just yet,\u201d you\ntold her.</p><p>\u201cRight,\nummm we could throw a party for when he gets back, and invite all of\nhis and yours closest friends and family. Then make an announcement\nat the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\nkinda like that idea, let\u2019s do that!\u201d</p><p>You\nboth sprang into conversation. You wanted to air out all the details.\nYou had to plan the guest list and what food would be served. This\nparty would definitely be one to remember.</p><p>You\nwere still airing out details, when your phone started to go off.\u201d</p><p>Looking\nat it you smiled, \u201cSpeak of the devil, it\u2019s Harry you told the\ntwo.\u201d</p><p>You\nanswered it cheerfully, \u201cHey Honey!

Tears were streaming down\nyour face, and your phone slipped out of your hand. Seeing your\nreaction and knowing that it was about her brother, Gemma quickly\ngrabbed the phone. You couldn\u2019t hear what she was saying. All that\nran through your head was the words that Jeff had spoken. \u2018There\u2019s\nbeen an accident, Harry\u2019s in the hospital.\u2019</p><p>The\nworld seemed to stop around you. You could somewhat sense Gemma\u2019s\narms around you, helping you walk to the car. You were all panicking.\nGemma seemed to be the one to take charge. She told the driver to\ntake you all to the airport, Jeff had a private plane ready and\nwaiting.</p><p>You\ncouldn\u2019t seem to form any words to speak. Gemma sat in the middle of\nyou and Anne, with an arm around both of you. There was not a dry eye\nin the car. You couldn\u2019t bare to look at Anne, knowing that if you\ndid you would break down ten times as worse.</p><p>The\ndrive to the airport seemed to take forever, as the driver dove in\nand out of traffic. He could sense the urgency of the situation so he\ntried to go as fast as he possibly could.</p><p>Within\ntwenty minutes the three of you were strapped into the cabin of the\nprivate plan and preparing for take off.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\nhas to be okay,\u201d you finally mumbled. \u201cOur kids need their\nfather.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\nwrapped you in her arms. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay. He would never leave you.\u201d</p><p>Her\nwords were little comfort, as the plane started to take off. It took\nabout an hour for the plane to touch back down. It had been the\nlongest hour of your life. Your mind had gone through all the worst\ncase possibilities that you could think off.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>There\nwas a car waiting for the three of you, as you stepped out of the\nplane. No words were said. Everyone was silently praying for the best\nand just eager to get to the hospital.</p><p>It\ntook another fifteen minutes in the car, before you finally arrived.\nYou grew more and more impatient as the clock dragged on.</p><p>Finally\nreaching your destination, all of you jumped out of the car\nsimultaneously. There were cops everywhere, holding back fans. You\ndidn\u2019t have time to think about that though. Rushing through the\ndoors, you were escorted to the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. Stepping out of\nthe elevator, a doctor approached your group.</p><p>\u201cAhh,\nyou must be here for Mr. Styles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\nI\u2019m his mother, this is his sister and his girlfriend. How is he? Can\nwe see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\nIm Dr. Jackson. Harry was in a very serious car accident. He was\nbanged up pretty badly. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any internal damage,\nbut he did break his left arm which will eventually need surgery. But\nother than that he should be okay. He\u2019s going to be extremely sore\nfor the next week or so, so make sure he gets plenty of rest. He\u2019s\nresting now, but your more than welcome to go in and see him. He\u2019s in\nsuite 320.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou doctor!\u201d You all said at once.</p><p>Walking\ndown the hallway, hand in hand, you looked for Harry\u2019s room. Once\nthere, you took a deep breath. Anne was the first one to walk through\nthe door, followed by Gemma. It took you a moment to gather up enough\nstrength to walk through the door.</p><p>Once\nyou could, you slowly made your way into the room. Harry was laid out\non the bed asleep. He had cuts and bruises everywhere and his left\narm was in a cast. Seeing the cast an idea came to you.</p><p>\u201cDoes\nanyone have a Sharpie I could use?\u201d You asked around.</p><p>Jeff,\nwho was seated next to Harry stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll go find you one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\nare you gonna do?\u201d asked Gemma.</p><p>\u201cScrew\na surprise party, I\u2019m gonna tell him now.\u201d You told her smiling.\nHer answering smile was encouraging.</p><p>Anne\nhad moved to sit in the chair beside Harry. \u201cI think that\u2019s a\nmarvelous idea dear.\u201d She said softly.</p><p>Jeff\ncame back in the room holding his treasure in his hands. \u201cI found\none!\u201d He exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThank\nyou!\u201d you told him as you took the silver sharpie from him.</p><p>Kneeling\nover, you started to wrote on Harry\u2019s cast. You were careful not to\nwake him.</p><p><i>My\nSweet Harry,</i></p><p><i>I\nlove you with all</i></p><p><i>of\nmy heart, and can not </i>\n</p><p><i>bear\nthe thought of losing you. </i>\n</p><p><i>Our\ntwo little angels need their </i>\n</p><p><i>Father!\nWe love you!!</i></p><p><br></p><p>Satisfied\nwith your work, you stepped back. It was getting late in the day, so\nthe room started to slowly get darker.</p><p>\u201cY/n,\ndear you need to rest. You look exhausted.\u201d Anne spoke up.</p><p>\u201cI\ncan\u2019t leave him,\u201d you stated simply. Taking in her words, you\ncarefully laid down in the bed beside Harry. Putting your hand over\nhis heart to make sure he was still there, you drifted off\npeacefully.</p><p>A\nfew hours had past before he began to stir. You axiomatically\nresponded and were wide awake.</p><p>\u201cHey\nthere sleepy head.\u201d You said smiling at him lovingly.</p><p>\u201cY/n?,\nWhen did you get here? I\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll\nsomeone had to go and give your entire family a heart attack,\u201d you\nteased. \u201cWe we\u2019re all together when we heard the news and we flew\nout as quick as we could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d\nHe asked, looking around he saw his mom asleep in the chair next to\nhis bed and his beloved sister asleep on a couch in the corner of the\nroom. \u201cWhy were you all together?\u201d He asked confused.</p><p>\u201cWell\nI needed their help with something so we went to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp\nwith what?\u201d He asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\nnot important anymore. Why don\u2019t you read what I wrote on your cast?\u201d\nYou suggested.</p><p>Intrigued,\nhe lifted his arm to take a look. It took him a few moments to\ncomprehend what the message said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\ngonna be a dad?\u201d He asked cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cYes,\nmy love you\u2019re gonna be a dad to two little angels.\u201d</p><p>Tears\nstarted to stream down his eyes, as he pulled you in close. \u201cI love\nyou so much! I won\u2019t ever leave you or our children.\u201d</p></p>",
