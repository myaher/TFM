And a lot of those theories are very interesting. But today I want to\u00a0talk about what happens\u00a0<i>after\u00a0</i>the war is over.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking\u00a0about some things that can occur after all the fighting is done and I would like your ideas too. Here\u2019s some of mine,</p><h2><i><b>1. The \u2018King\u2019 of the Seven Kingdoms?</b></i></h2><p>Once the fighting is over, Westeros will need a leader to take it back to its old glory. But who will be that leader?\u00a0</p><p>If you read my last blog post, you would know that I mentioned about the possibilities of Cersei dying and the speculations regarding Dany\u2019s death and how she may fulfil the Nissa Nissa prophesy. I believe Cersei will die. And I believe that Dany will die, maybe in childbirth or she will be killed by Jon so that he could turn his sword into Lightbringer (if he is Azor Ahai), or maybe she\u2019ll fall fighting the Night King and become a wight! Maybe Jon would be forced to kill her before killing the Night King. That would surely be bittersweet. Not just because Jon would have to kill her but because she would surely fight back and try to kill him at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>But in the end, Jon will become King just like Robert Baratheon. Neither of them started their respective fights for the Throne. They started it for things that were way more important to them- Jon for survival and Robert for revenge. But like Robert before him, Jon would find himself in a position where he is the most viable choice. And I\u2019m pretty sure Jon would take over the helm because if there is one thing he doesn\u2019t run away from, it\u2019s leading. He became the Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch and then he became King in the North. He won\u2019t ask for it, but if the people of Westeros choose him, he won\u2019t disappoint them.\u00a0</p><p>Or you know, he could just take the title himself. He is the heir anyway. But we know that won\u2019t happen.\u00a0</p><h2><i><b>2. What about the Capital?\u00a0\u00a0[SPOILERS]</b></i></h2><p>Right now there is a lot of buzz surrounding the fighting scenes in S8. There was a picture which showed Winterfell in a horrendous condition, burning, and bodies lying one over the other like haystacks. There is a strong possibility that Winterfell would fall into the hands of the Night King and that the final battle for the dawn would continue in King\u2019s Landing, the current home of the Queen and the capital of Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But when the fighting is over, all that is left of King\u2019s Landing may just be ashes. Think about it, three dragons in the sky, hundreds of thousands of soldiers/wights and hundreds of ships bombarding the city. The fighting will be brutal and King\u2019s Landing may see its end. There are also speculations about the destruction of the Iron throne, either during the fighting or after it, just to finish off a major reason behind thousands of deaths over centuries of its existence.\u00a0</p><p>So what will happen\u00a0when Jon becomes King?</p><p>I want to believe that given both King\u2019s Landing and Winterfell would need\u00a0a major restoration after the war, Jon would choose Winterfell as his home and a place from where he\u2019ll do all the ruling.\u00a0</p><p>In the show, Jon has only been the King\u2019s Landing once in S7 while he has lived his entire life in the North and a major part of it back at Winterfell. We also know just how much it would mean to the Northerners to see a &lsquo;Northern&rsquo; King of the Seven Kingdoms (or six or five, whatever number is left) ruling from Winterfell. The North wanted independence when Robb was chosen King and they probably wanted it now as well before Jon bent the knee and gave up his title. It won&rsquo;t exactly be like independence but it would definitely help if someone from the North rules from the North.</p><p>And most of the royal families of the South would probably not see the end of the war to raise any major objections for the change of the capital.\u00a0The Lannisters would be dead, Tyrion may survive and maybe Cersei\u2019s child too\u00a0if she really is pregnant. But then again, the North is just as much away from King\u2019s Landing as King\u2019s Landing is from the North. So if the King wills it, I don\u2019t even see a reason for objections.</p><p>The North is the biggest kingdom amongst the seven and the closest to the things that lie beyond the wall. But after the Night King is defeated, the threat from beyond the wall will basically be none. The wildlings are now fighting and living around the rest of the people and I\u2019m sure they will stay south of the wall after the war as well. But if Jon becomes King, he\u2019ll be smart enough to know that it\u2019s best to restore the wall back to its old glory and keep the same protocol as before. Who knows, maybe the Night King has a backup plan? Maybe the dead will rise again someday. Jon will be clever enough to not underestimate the far North and the surprises it can present.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But to conclude this particular topic, I\u2019ll say that the show started at Winterfell and it may end at Winterfell too. I don\u2019t see a reason for it to not be so.</p><h2><b><i>3. Aegon Targaryen or Jon Snow?</i></b></h2><p>\u201cYou are a Greyjoy. And you are a Stark,\u201d Jon told Theon.\u00a0</p><p>Jon has lived as a bastard his entire life. But at times, he wanted to be a Stark, like his father and his brothers. But now we know who he really is and I\u2019m curious if he takes up his real name once the war is over. Will he make people call him Aegon?\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m going to make a prediction here and say that Jon will continue being \u2018Jon\u2019 even if he becomes King because the Starks are the only family he has ever known and Ned Stark is the only man he has ever considered his father.\u00a0</p><p>One fragment of history may change his lineage but it won\u2019t change his heart. And Jon Snow will always be a Stark in his heart.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>There are speculations regarding Arya and how she may leave Westeros once the war is won, and before leaving I can see her telling Jon something along the lines of,\u00a0\u201cA man can choose whoever he wants to be. A man can take up whatever name he likes. A man can be anyone, or a man can be no one. But\u00a0 whatever you do, you\u2019ll always be a Stark to me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>If Dany gives Jon a baby or two before dying, what he can do to make sure the Targaryen name survives is to give the babies the Targaryen name.\u00a0But I think Jon will always stay a Stark- to him and to the people around him.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

The North wanted independence when Robb was chosen King and they probably wanted it now as well before Jon bent the knee and gave up his title. It won\u2019t exactly be like independence but it would definitely help if someone from the North rules from the North.</p><p>And most of the royal families of the South would probably not see the end of the war to raise any major objections for the change of the capital.\u00a0The Lannisters would be dead, Tyrion may survive and maybe Cersei\u2019s child too\u00a0if she really is pregnant. But then again, the North is just as much away from King\u2019s Landing as King\u2019s Landing is from the North. So if the King wills it, I don\u2019t even see a reason for objections.</p><p>The North is the biggest kingdom amongst the seven and the closest to the things that lie beyond the wall. But after the Night King is defeated, the threat from beyond the wall will basically be none. The wildlings are now fighting and living around the rest of the people and I\u2019m sure they will stay south of the wall after the war as well. But if Jon becomes King, he\u2019ll be smart enough to know that it\u2019s best to restore the wall back to its old glory and keep the same protocol as before. Who knows, maybe the Night King has a backup plan? Maybe the dead will rise again someday. Jon will be clever enough to not underestimate the far North and the surprises it can present.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But to conclude this particular topic, I\u2019ll say that the show started at Winterfell and it may end at Winterfell too. I don\u2019t see a reason for it to not be so.</p><h2><b><i>3. Aegon Targaryen or Jon Snow?</i></b></h2><p>\u201cYou are a Greyjoy. And you are a Stark,\u201d Jon told Theon.\u00a0</p><p>Jon has lived as a bastard his entire life. But at times, he wanted to be a Stark, like his father and his brothers. But now we know who he really is and I\u2019m curious if he takes up his real name once the war is over. Will he make people call him Aegon?\u00a0</p><p>I\u2019m going to make a prediction here and say that Jon will continue being \u2018Jon\u2019 even if he becomes King because the Starks are the only family he has ever known and Ned Stark is the only man he has ever considered his father.\u00a0</p><p>One fragment of history may change his lineage but it won\u2019t change his heart. And Jon Snow will always be a Stark in his heart.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>There are speculations regarding Arya and how she may leave Westeros once the war is won, and before leaving I can see her telling Jon something along the lines of,\u00a0\u201cA man can choose whoever he wants to be. A man can take up whatever name he likes. A man can be anyone, or a man can be no one. But\u00a0 whatever you do, you\u2019ll always be a Stark to me.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>If Dany gives Jon a baby or two before dying, what he can do to make sure the Targaryen name survives is to give the babies the Targaryen name.\u00a0But I think Jon will always stay a Stark- to him and to the people around him.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

I believe Cersei will die. And I believe that Dany will die, maybe in childbirth or she will be killed by Jon so that he could turn his sword into Lightbringer (if he is Azor Ahai), or maybe she\u2019ll fall fighting the Night King and become a wight! Maybe Jon would be forced to kill her before killing the Night King. That would surely be bittersweet. Not just because Jon would have to kill her but because she would surely fight back and try to kill him at the same time.\u00a0</p><p>But in the end, Jon will become King just like Robert Baratheon. Neither of them started their respective fights for the Throne. They started it for things that were way more important to them- Jon for survival and Robert for revenge. But like Robert before him, Jon would find himself in a position where he is the most viable choice. And I\u2019m pretty sure Jon would take over the helm because if there is one thing he doesn\u2019t run away from, it\u2019s leading. He became the Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch and then he became King in the North. He won\u2019t ask for it, but if the people of Westeros choose him, he won\u2019t disappoint them.\u00a0</p><p>Or you know, he could just take the title himself. He is the heir anyway.

There is a strong possibility that Winterfell would fall into the hands of the Night King and that the final battle for the dawn would continue in King\u2019s Landing, the current home of the Queen and the capital of Westeros.\u00a0</p><p>But when the fighting is over, all that is left of King\u2019s Landing may just be ashes. Think about it, three dragons in the sky, hundreds of thousands of soldiers/wights and hundreds of ships bombarding the city. The fighting will be brutal and King\u2019s Landing may see its end.

D is a fan favorite and Sansa is not (and is teased for being like LF and Cersei), so people are more likely to see D as good and Sansa as bad in this conflict, aka believing that Jon (also good) will side with D.</p><p>- my dad\u2019s opinion on this conflict: D is shown as villain, so it is highly unlikely Jon will be on her side\u2014however, he could advocate for her at the beginning to build tension before he takes the Starks\u2019/Sansa\u2019s side in the end. He thinks this could cause major tension between Jon and Ar*a more than Jon and Sansa because their first reunion may be plagued by this conflict, and because Sansa plays the game but Ar*a speaks up against things she disagrees with</p><p>So basically his takeaway was that the teaser\u2019s narrative is that of D vs Starks, specifically D vs Sansa in the new footage.

Sansa was the one who instigated the change in Theon&rsquo;s character which led him to his Season 6-7 storyline. To say that she was useless just because she didn&rsquo;t kill no one in the earlier seasons is ridiculous when her existence alone had such an impact on the story/character.

As a group, we write individually but we come together to share our collective experiences with different media. For TGE Watches, we talk about movies and TV shows. TGE Plays, we play games together. For TGE Reads, we select a book, read it, and then discuss it together. We are hoping through our collective knowledge and know-how to share these geeky interests with our readers, viewers, and listeners. \n\nListen to our podcast at https://www.thegeekembassy.com/category/podcast",
