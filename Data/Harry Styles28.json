        "body": "<p><b>The iconique sofa fuck and hotel fuck in one chapter? Don\u2019t thank me.</b></p><p>June 20, 2014<br/>Paris, France</p><p>You can hear him in the bathroom \u2013 the low hum of his voice clamoring over the showerhead, singing a song about running away with your girl \u2013 and you think that maybe there was some hidden truth somewhere in his words. How, so easily, you can just pack your bags and run away \u2013 cutting your hair, changing your names. You\u2019d send postcards home, detailing your adventures, and each night you\u2019d find yourselves knotted beneath the sheets, and the world would never know. </p><p>You would have disappeared, gone with the wind, and the only thing they would be left with is your memory. </p><p>To your left, laying beside a pair of your knickers, is an empty champagne bottle. He was quick to pop it open, nearly taking out one of the bedside table lamps with his incoordination with the cork, and in nearly a few minutes, the bottle was sucked dry, and thrown carelessly over your shoulder. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t get his hands on you quick enough; it was like he was a child again unwrapping the biggest present under the tree on Christmas day. He started with unbuttoning your shirt, and only managed a few before trying his luck with your trousers. You could say with confidence he was a patient man, but when it came to you, all patience was lost in the haste to get you naked and on top of him as possible. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019cock\u2019s been hard since the bloody show,\u201d and he wasn\u2019t wrong. When he caught sight of you standing off on the side of the stage, peeking your head from around the curtain, he felt every ounce of blood fall directly to his cock, and he spent the remainder of the show certain his bulge was going to rip through his pants. \u201cSuck me, please. Need that pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>You knew his mother raised him right when he still used manners when he wanted you to suck him off.</p><!-- more --><p>You loved his cock, and you felt strange to even think such a thing because\u2026well, a cock is a cock. A bit strange looking, flaccid or not, but you somehow found a love with the man who knew how to work it in just the right ways, and thus, you somehow could say you loved the cock itself.</p><p>You also loved the way his ego soared when you would tell him such things. How he would stall for a moment, letting the words sink in and marinate in his gut, \u201cYeah, she does fucking love my cock, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d He would pull back, watching himself slide out, glistening with your wet, and slam himself back in until he felt himself reach your stomach. He loved that confidence you gave him, as if he was the best fuck of your life. </p><p>And you could say with your very own confidence that he very much was.</p><p>It\u2019s been 223 days since the two of you met \u2013 7 months and 11 days to be exact \u2013 in the bathroom of Alexa Chung\u2019s house. It was his fault, if we are pointing blame at anyone, for not locking the door behind him. Maybe it would have been different if he even knew you would be attending that night, but maybe he was left out of the loop for a reason. Everyone knows Harry likes surprises. </p><p>He was mid-wee when you walked in, scuffling your heels through the threshold, until you caught sight of him, standing with his cock out, staring at you like a deer in headlights. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014oh, shit, sorry!\u201d And gone you were, just as hastily as you appeared. </p><p>Over the years, he fantasized over every outcome and scenario of the events of finally meeting you. Sometimes it would be at an award show, and others it would be backstage at one of your shows \u2013 if he ever found the time to attend one. \u00a0Not in a million years would be ever dream of your first encounter to be while he was in the middle of taking a piss. </p><p>But, he\u2019s just thankful it wasn\u2019t a #2.</p><p>He was quick to finish up, run his hands under the tap, and fling himself out the door, scanning over the numerous heads for the one who just involuntarily saw his cock. </p><p><i>Was she impressed?</i></p><p>You found yourself in the upstairs toilet, putting on a secondary coat of lipstick before dabbing at it with a piece of toilet roll. Your reflection said you were tired; if it wasn\u2019t the bags under your eyes that gave it away, it was your inability to hear a partygoer on the other side of the door knocking impatiently. </p><p>\u201cHow much longer now? I need\u2019a wee!\u201d</p><p>Sometimes when you share yourself with the entire world, five minutes to yourself, alone in a stranger\u2019s bathroom, is all you need to get yourself through the rest of the night. </p><p>It was no other than Kelly Osbourne on the other side of the door, and you wouldn\u2019t know that if it wasn\u2019t for her father. A fan, you are, but also you just love stories of people snorting ants and licking up piss. You would give an arm and a leg to sit down and talk to Ozzy Osbourne, one of the kings of rock in your eyes. If you could have it your way, you would aboard his crazy train any day.</p><p>You bound down the stairs, make an immediate left, scanter through the dining room, until you see him, standing in the kitchen beside Nick, a glass of whisky in his hand. He doesn\u2019t initially see you, and that gives you time to wonder how you\u2019ll even approach him. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I walked in on you peeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum didn\u2019t teach me to knock before entering a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of drunk; I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d</p><p>But it was Nick who saw you first. </p><p>\u201cEyyy, there she is!\u201d He swayed on his feet, pushing the bowl into Harry\u2019s remaining hand, and staggered over to the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t tell \u2018arry, but he\u2019s been talking \u2018bout you all night.\u201d</p><p>You glance over his shoulder to see him taking a sip of his drink, his brows tightly pulled together. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019probably have me mixed up with someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Arry, mate! Look who I found.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened as Nick guided me over, an arm swung over my shoulders, and he sat his glass down to reach his hand out. </p><p>\u201cKinda already met ear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I saw your penis.\u201d The words flew out your lips quicker than you could tell yourself to shut up, but\u2026you weren\u2019t entirely wrong. You did see something, not meaning to, but you did. \u201cSorry I walked in on you\u2026 Mum didn\u2019t teach me manners.\u201d</p><p>Harry stared back at me blankly, his mouth gaped open like a fish, his hand still sitting in the air between us. I took a light hold and shook it. </p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d But deep down, he wanted to crawl beneath the floorboards and die.</p><p>You know him, just like the rest of the world. One of the five members of One Direction, and probably the most talked about in the media. News outlets love him, love getting any scoop they can find \u2013 more so fiction than not \u2013 and you know any word that gets out about the encounter the pair of you had just minutes before, it will be headlines the next day. </p><p><i>\u201cThis just in: Who walked in on Harry Styles taking a wee? The answer will shock you!\u201d</i></p><p>You recognize him from more than just magazines. You\u2019re fairly positive you\u2019ve bumped into him before backstage earlier this year at the Teens Choice Awards. Just a seconds encounter, and you were off being dragged into another direction; you were certain he wouldn\u2019t even remember such an event. </p><p>Little did you know, he thought about the way your arm brushed his for at least a month. </p><p>He was taller in person, or so you thought; long, slender legs squeezed into a pair of the tightest jeans he could possibly find. You think his quaff added a couple extra inches, but you weren\u2019t counting. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you before, a few months ago? Teens Choice?\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly tackled me backstage? Yeah, I remember.\u201d He put the brim of the drink to his lips, a smirk hiding just behind the glass. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m such an asshole to you.\u201d And you meant it, but you weren\u2019t expecting him to nearly choke on his drink. </p><p>He was cute, you couldn\u2019t deny these facts. No wonder the media loved to engage him with every woman he ever merely glanced at. </p><p>\u201cLet me get you a drink,\u201d he set his glass down, turning around to fetch another in the cupboard. \u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d For most of the night, you\u2019ve just taken sips out of random glasses from whoever you spoke to. You think you saw Alexa with a glass of champagne, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a bottle in sight. \u201cVodka and cranberry is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka and cranberry it is.\u201d</p><p>You met him at 9:54 that evening, and by 11:02 you learned that his lips tasted like Jim Beam and maple syrup.<br/></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cRemember the night we met?\u201d</p><p>Harry pulled with his teeth a ponytail holder from his wrist \u2013 one that you were certain he had knicked from your luggage \u2013 and turned just enough that he could see you from the corner of his eye. </p><p>\u201cDo I remember the best night of my life? Yes, in fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s told you on many occasions that despite that night not being the night the two of you decided a relationship was the road you wanted to be on, he still counts that as a night to remember. It began with a snog in the upstairs bathroom, which turned into you rubbing him through his pants, which led you to the downstairs sitting room where you resided the remainder of the night. </p><p>\u201cWhy the sofa? Was the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedroom taken? Yes.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWho it was, we will never know.\u201d </p><p>And to this remaining day, the question is still hung in the air on who fucked in that upstairs bedroom. </p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> a good night. No denying that.\u201d You leaned back in the bed, kicking your knickers off and throwing them with a little toss off the bed. \u201cI remember how eager you were to get me back to my place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBloody eager? I had been dreaming of that night for years. I would have railed you in an alleyway if it meant I could have you again.\u201d</p><p>A little sarcastic, yes, but you knew him too well to test the truth. </p><p>You watched him walk from the bathroom to the front of the bed, reaching down to discard of his bottoms, his eyes never once leaving the dripping pulse between your legs. </p><p>\u201cI fucking love that juicy cunt of yours.\u201d He slid up, resting on his elbows, and used an arm to spread your legs farther. \u201cCould fuck you all day and you\u2019d still be dripping for me.\u201d</p><p>He loves to take his time, kissing and biting and sucking, leaving small patches of blossomed red skin all down your legs, but tonight his tongue was quick, like a rattlesnake going for its prey. His palms held your thighs apart, exposing your center in all its glistening glory. </p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d<br/></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d He breathed into your neck, gently kissing just under your ear. His hands have been taped to your side for an hour now, pushing your center over the bulge in his pants. \u201cJust wanna fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>You could feel him giggle into your neck, pecking little kisses over the small, red path he had taken a bite out of. </p><p>\u201cAre you hungry for something?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, fiddling with your waist, digging his fingers into your flesh before reaching down to fondle your thighs. You look down just in time to see crescent marks imbedded in your skin. </p><p>\u201cYou want to show me how good you can fuck me?\u201d</p><p>It would be his pleasure. </p><p>All it took was for him to unbutton his pants, wiggling slightly to push them down just far enough to remove his cock, and you lifted up on your knees to hover of him just right. Your breathing hitched as you felt the tip prod around your center, and you reached down to help guide him right where he wanted to be. </p><p>From the others in the room, the act didn\u2019t appear to be any strange of the sort; they probably weren\u2019t paying much attention, if anyone was being honest. You were hovered over his lap, fiddling with something in between the two of you, until you were sat back down and remained there for a beat. </p><p>You reached down where the two of you were connected, feeling his cock right where he met into you, and smiled, letting out a little giggle before falling onto his chest. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re actually having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>And boy, did those words hit him like a fucking freight train. He was having <i>sex</i> with you. His <i>cock</i> was <i>inside</i> of you. He had met you just a few hours before, and his biggest worry then was having to confront you after you walked in on him in the loo, and now here he was, sitting with you on top his cock in a room full of people. </p><p>\u201cYou feel like a fucking dream,\u201d he ran his fingers up your back and up your shoulders until he held you tight against him. \u201cA really good, fucking dream.\u201d</p><p>You sat there while he held you, listening to the thud of his heart pounding against his chest like it was begging to be released. His breathing was tight, and his hands shook as they trailed back down to your waist. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t get over the burn, the stretch of your flesh wrapping around him. You\u2019ve felt things similar before, but he was an entire new game to play. You wanted to move \u2013 you needed some sort of stimulation \u2013 but despite the fogginess in your brain, you knew eyes would be glued to you, and then the headlines tomorrow would read, <i>\u201cWho did Harry Styles fuck on a sofa at Alexa Chung\u2019s birthday party?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda between places right now\u2026 Was gonna crash at Nick\u2019s when we left\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna come to mine? It\u2019s still fairly new\u2026 Packing boxes, and what have you.\u201d You shrug, leaning up just enough to grind your hips against his. His pubes gave just the right amount of stimulation to your clit, and it sent a shock all throughout your body. \u201cMy bed is unpacked, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019a fucked\u2019ya on the floor if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And in a whirlwind, you were flipped onto your back, your head hitting the leather cushion with a light thud, and he was back on top of you, reaching between his legs to fill that sweet cunt up once again. </p><p>Maybe it was after he tossed you off of him, exposing himself in the process, or maybe it was when he thrusted hard into you, a deep, grunting moan escaping through his parted lips that gave away to the secret you two were sharing on the sofa, but your friends in the room didn\u2019t quite hide their shock. </p><p>\u201cOh, no they are<i> not</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, fucking way!\u201d</p><p>Oh, but yes, fucking way. They could judge the two of you all they wanted, but they were also the ones who never left the room. <br/></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he breathed, spanking a hand over your ass with a bellowing smack. \u201cRide daddy\u2019s cock\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>223 days since you met, 223 days since your first fuck, and 223 days since you found out he had a bit of daddy kink running wild through his blood. </p><p>\u201cDoes daddy like it when I squeeze his cock?\u201d You could feel him twitch deep inside your stomach.</p><p>\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t like a tease.\u201d <i>Li</i>e. Daddy most certainly loved a little teasing now and then, which is how you ended up on the sofa in the first place. 223 days ago. </p><p>You deeply pitied whoever had the room next to yours. </p><p>If it wasn\u2019t the wet smacking that would send angered knocking at your guys\u2019 door, it sure as hell would be the incredulous moaning. </p><p>\u201cFuck, daddy! Fuck me harder!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Right there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum\u2014I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d</p><p>But who could blame you? You were just two kids in love. <br/></p><p>*</p><p>When you ask him about the events that transpired that evening, he will merely blush and turn away. He doesn\u2019t talk about how he barely could catch his own breath and worried about the location of his inhaler, nor does he mention how he came before you, his adrenaline rushing and pulsing and sending him to a blissful oblivion without any care in the world. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care; you were still taking him back home that night. </p><p>By the time the two of you were finished, only a few faces remained around. They didn\u2019t glance your way when Harry leaned up to tuck himself back in his pants, nor did they say anything when you stood up had to cup your crotch with your dress so no leakage would spill down your legs. </p><p>He kissed your temple, his legs weak themselves, and went on a hunt to find Alexa and wish her another happy birthday. You found your purse, your keys still tucked away, and a few beats later, the two of you were scurrying off back to your abode. </p><p>He was very apologetic about leaving you without an orgasm, and he made sure you knew. </p><p>\u201cNot how you treat a lady, is it?\u201d</p><p>Your favorite part of the story is what happens just after this. You were finally free of that dress, something you had been dreaming of most of the evening. Your heels were discarded elsewhere, and Harry took initiative on what would be done with your delicates. </p><p>He felt it would be a crime to leave them on. You agreed. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should leave this bed until you\u2019re lying in a puddle\u2026 What d\u2019ya say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d It was faint, but he perked up like a dog hearing his bag of treats being opened in the other room. He looked angry; his brows were tightly knitted together, and he had pulled his lip between his teeth like a snarl. </p><p>The woman before him was opening him up to things he never knew he loved. </p><p>\u201cGet on your hands and knees.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d</p><p><i>Slap</i>. </p><p>By the next morning, your bottom was as red as an apple. You\u2019d lost count on how many spankings you took, but that was the point. You wanted to push this boy to places you knew he had never been, and by the end of the night, he laid in your bed with soaking hair, a glistening chest, and a drooping cock that could fuck no more. </p><p>\u201cTell me, have I been the best fuck of your life?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, but you saw his cock twice at your words. His dimple popped, and he peeked at you through his lashes with a little twinkle. </p><p>\u201cYou, my love, are the best fuck of my life.\u201d</p><p>If Harry were to ask his thirteen-year-old self what it would be like to fuck the girl from the magazines, he would say it would be like winning the jackpot, and he could tell himself now it was very much the same. He has all the money in the world, more than a man could ever need, and that night with you meant more to him than every dollar in his back account combined. </p><p>So, by the next morning, when he woke to you standing bare in front of him, nudging his shoulder, your makeup still smeared from the night before, he was already planning in his head all the place she wanted to fuck you that day. </p><p>Kitchen sex while the pancakes cooked? Laundry room sex while you separated your darks from your whites? Bathroom sex while you brushed your teeth?</p><p>\u201cHey, I got some meetings to get to today, so\u2026\u201d He knew that sound. He felt his stomach drop and splatter all over the floor. The sound of, \u201cHey, last night was fun, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was great\u2014\u201d<i> Fuck.</i> \u201cI, um\u2026we should do it again sometime, yeah?\u201d <i>Fuck!</i></p><p>His heart was breaking right in front of you, and you were too blind to see it. This boy had been in love with you for years now, and he dreamed to one day share with you everyday what the two of you shared that previous night, but all you were to him was\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll be straight with you. I think you deserve that, yeah? You\u2019re great, you really are. So sweet, and charming. But I\u2019m not wanting anything serious, or\u2026anything. Just got out of a relationship, and just needed some fun. You feel me?\u201d</p><p><i>You feel me?</i> He would be mocking that the rest of the day. </p><p>\u201cI can call a cab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He tore the sheets from his body, and was quick to get up and search for his clothes. You didn\u2019t say another word as he got dressed, picked up his phone, and was out the door. <br/></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, yeah?\u201d You rested your head on his chest, listening to the beating like a little drum. \u201cHow about I stay with you the rest of the tour? Be your personal groupie?\u201d</p><p>He was silent, but he lifted his leg to wrap around your own, running his foot up and down your calf. </p><p>\u201cYou have me all day tomorrow, don\u2019t forget. I leave the morning of the 22nd.\u201d </p><p>Fans would say the next day that Harry was sick, and it was quite obvious, but in reality, the painful, battering ache that blasted itself on repeat in his head only made it hard to smile at a crowd that night. If he could have it his way, he would love to run away with you and forget everything. As happy as performing made him, there was a woman who made him just a little happier.<br/></p>",

Need that pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>You knew his mother raised him right when he still used manners when he wanted you to suck him off.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You loved his cock, and you felt strange to even think such a thing because\u2026well, a cock is a cock. A bit strange looking, flaccid or not, but you somehow found a love with the man who knew how to work it in just the right ways, and thus, you somehow could say you loved the cock itself.</p><p>You also loved the way his ego soared when you would tell him such things. How he would stall for a moment, letting the words sink in and marinate in his gut, \u201cYeah, she does fucking love my cock, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d He would pull back, watching himself slide out, glistening with your wet, and slam himself back in until he felt himself reach your stomach. He loved that confidence you gave him, as if he was the best fuck of your life. </p><p>And you could say with your very own confidence that he very much was.</p><p>It\u2019s been 223 days since the two of you met \u2013 7 months and 11 days to be exact \u2013 in the bathroom of Alexa Chung\u2019s house. It was his fault, if we are pointing blame at anyone, for not locking the door behind him. Maybe it would have been different if he even knew you would be attending that night, but maybe he was left out of the loop for a reason. Everyone knows Harry likes surprises. </p><p>He was mid-wee when you walked in, scuffling your heels through the threshold, until you caught sight of him, standing with his cock out, staring at you like a deer in headlights. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014oh, shit, sorry!\u201d And gone you were, just as hastily as you appeared. </p><p>Over the years, he fantasized over every outcome and scenario of the events of finally meeting you. Sometimes it would be at an award show, and others it would be backstage at one of your shows \u2013 if he ever found the time to attend one. \u00a0Not in a million years would be ever dream of your first encounter to be while he was in the middle of taking a piss. </p><p>But, he\u2019s just thankful it wasn\u2019t a #2.</p><p>He was quick to finish up, run his hands under the tap, and fling himself out the door, scanning over the numerous heads for the one who just involuntarily saw his cock. </p><p><i>Was she impressed?</i></p><p>You found yourself in the upstairs toilet, putting on a secondary coat of lipstick before dabbing at it with a piece of toilet roll. Your reflection said you were tired; if it wasn\u2019t the bags under your eyes that gave it away, it was your inability to hear a partygoer on the other side of the door knocking impatiently. </p><p>\u201cHow much longer now? I need\u2019a wee!\u201d</p><p>Sometimes when you share yourself with the entire world, five minutes to yourself, alone in a stranger\u2019s bathroom, is all you need to get yourself through the rest of the night. </p><p>It was no other than Kelly Osbourne on the other side of the door, and you wouldn\u2019t know that if it wasn\u2019t for her father. A fan, you are, but also you just love stories of people snorting ants and licking up piss. You would give an arm and a leg to sit down and talk to Ozzy Osbourne, one of the kings of rock in your eyes. If you could have it your way, you would aboard his crazy train any day.</p><p>You bound down the stairs, make an immediate left, scanter through the dining room, until you see him, standing in the kitchen beside Nick, a glass of whisky in his hand. He doesn\u2019t initially see you, and that gives you time to wonder how you\u2019ll even approach him. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I walked in on you peeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum didn\u2019t teach me to knock before entering a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of drunk; I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d</p><p>But it was Nick who saw you first. </p><p>\u201cEyyy, there she is!\u201d He swayed on his feet, pushing the bowl into Harry\u2019s remaining hand, and staggered over to the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t tell \u2018arry, but he\u2019s been talking \u2018bout you all night.\u201d</p><p>You glance over his shoulder to see him taking a sip of his drink, his brows tightly pulled together. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019probably have me mixed up with someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Arry, mate! Look who I found.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened as Nick guided me over, an arm swung over my shoulders, and he sat his glass down to reach his hand out. </p><p>\u201cKinda already met ear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I saw your penis.\u201d The words flew out your lips quicker than you could tell yourself to shut up, but\u2026you weren\u2019t entirely wrong. You did see something, not meaning to, but you did. \u201cSorry I walked in on you\u2026 Mum didn\u2019t teach me manners.\u201d</p><p>Harry stared back at me blankly, his mouth gaped open like a fish, his hand still sitting in the air between us. I took a light hold and shook it. </p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d But deep down, he wanted to crawl beneath the floorboards and die.</p><p>You know him, just like the rest of the world. One of the five members of One Direction, and probably the most talked about in the media. News outlets love him, love getting any scoop they can find \u2013 more so fiction than not \u2013 and you know any word that gets out about the encounter the pair of you had just minutes before, it will be headlines the next day. </p><p><i>\u201cThis just in: Who walked in on Harry Styles taking a wee? The answer will shock you!\u201d</i></p><p>You recognize him from more than just magazines. You\u2019re fairly positive you\u2019ve bumped into him before backstage earlier this year at the Teens Choice Awards. Just a seconds encounter, and you were off being dragged into another direction; you were certain he wouldn\u2019t even remember such an event. </p><p>Little did you know, he thought about the way your arm brushed his for at least a month. </p><p>He was taller in person, or so you thought; long, slender legs squeezed into a pair of the tightest jeans he could possibly find. You think his quaff added a couple extra inches, but you weren\u2019t counting. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you before, a few months ago? Teens Choice?\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly tackled me backstage? Yeah, I remember.\u201d He put the brim of the drink to his lips, a smirk hiding just behind the glass. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m such an asshole to you.\u201d And you meant it, but you weren\u2019t expecting him to nearly choke on his drink. </p><p>He was cute, you couldn\u2019t deny these facts. No wonder the media loved to engage him with every woman he ever merely glanced at. </p><p>\u201cLet me get you a drink,\u201d he set his glass down, turning around to fetch another in the cupboard. \u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d For most of the night, you\u2019ve just taken sips out of random glasses from whoever you spoke to. You think you saw Alexa with a glass of champagne, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a bottle in sight. \u201cVodka and cranberry is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka and cranberry it is.\u201d</p><p>You met him at 9:54 that evening, and by 11:02 you learned that his lips tasted like Jim Beam and maple syrup.<br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cRemember the night we met?\u201d</p><p>Harry pulled with his teeth a ponytail holder from his wrist \u2013 one that you were certain he had knicked from your luggage \u2013 and turned just enough that he could see you from the corner of his eye. </p><p>\u201cDo I remember the best night of my life? Yes, in fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s told you on many occasions that despite that night not being the night the two of you decided a relationship was the road you wanted to be on, he still counts that as a night to remember. It began with a snog in the upstairs bathroom, which turned into you rubbing him through his pants, which led you to the downstairs sitting room where you resided the remainder of the night. </p><p>\u201cWhy the sofa? Was the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedroom taken? Yes.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWho it was, we will never know.\u201d </p><p>And to this remaining day, the question is still hung in the air on who fucked in that upstairs bedroom. </p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> a good night. No denying that.\u201d You leaned back in the bed, kicking your knickers off and throwing them with a little toss off the bed. \u201cI remember how eager you were to get me back to my place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBloody eager? I had been dreaming of that night for years. I would have railed you in an alleyway if it meant I could have you again.\u201d</p><p>A little sarcastic, yes, but you knew him too well to test the truth. </p><p>You watched him walk from the bathroom to the front of the bed, reaching down to discard of his bottoms, his eyes never once leaving the dripping pulse between your legs. </p><p>\u201cI fucking love that juicy cunt of yours.\u201d He slid up, resting on his elbows, and used an arm to spread your legs farther. \u201cCould fuck you all day and you\u2019d still be dripping for me.\u201d</p><p>He loves to take his time, kissing and biting and sucking, leaving small patches of blossomed red skin all down your legs, but tonight his tongue was quick, like a rattlesnake going for its prey. His palms held your thighs apart, exposing your center in all its glistening glory. </p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d<br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d He breathed into your neck, gently kissing just under your ear. His hands have been taped to your side for an hour now, pushing your center over the bulge in his pants. \u201cJust wanna fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>You could feel him giggle into your neck, pecking little kisses over the small, red path he had taken a bite out of. </p><p>\u201cAre you hungry for something?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, fiddling with your waist, digging his fingers into your flesh before reaching down to fondle your thighs. You look down just in time to see crescent marks imbedded in your skin. </p><p>\u201cYou want to show me how good you can fuck me?\u201d</p><p>It would be his pleasure. </p><p>All it took was for him to unbutton his pants, wiggling slightly to push them down just far enough to remove his cock, and you lifted up on your knees to hover of him just right. Your breathing hitched as you felt the tip prod around your center, and you reached down to help guide him right where he wanted to be. </p><p>From the others in the room, the act didn\u2019t appear to be any strange of the sort; they probably weren\u2019t paying much attention, if anyone was being honest. You were hovered over his lap, fiddling with something in between the two of you, until you were sat back down and remained there for a beat. </p><p>You reached down where the two of you were connected, feeling his cock right where he met into you, and smiled, letting out a little giggle before falling onto his chest. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re actually having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>And boy, did those words hit him like a fucking freight train. He was having <i>sex</i> with you. His <i>cock</i> was <i>inside</i> of you. He had met you just a few hours before, and his biggest worry then was having to confront you after you walked in on him in the loo, and now here he was, sitting with you on top his cock in a room full of people. </p><p>\u201cYou feel like a fucking dream,\u201d he ran his fingers up your back and up your shoulders until he held you tight against him. \u201cA really good, fucking dream.\u201d</p><p>You sat there while he held you, listening to the thud of his heart pounding against his chest like it was begging to be released. His breathing was tight, and his hands shook as they trailed back down to your waist. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t get over the burn, the stretch of your flesh wrapping around him. You\u2019ve felt things similar before, but he was an entire new game to play. You wanted to move \u2013 you needed some sort of stimulation \u2013 but despite the fogginess in your brain, you knew eyes would be glued to you, and then the headlines tomorrow would read, <i>\u201cWho did Harry Styles fuck on a sofa at Alexa Chung\u2019s birthday party?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda between places right now\u2026 Was gonna crash at Nick\u2019s when we left\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna come to mine? It\u2019s still fairly new\u2026 Packing boxes, and what have you.\u201d You shrug, leaning up just enough to grind your hips against his. His pubes gave just the right amount of stimulation to your clit, and it sent a shock all throughout your body. \u201cMy bed is unpacked, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019a fucked\u2019ya on the floor if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And in a whirlwind, you were flipped onto your back, your head hitting the leather cushion with a light thud, and he was back on top of you, reaching between his legs to fill that sweet cunt up once again. </p><p>Maybe it was after he tossed you off of him, exposing himself in the process, or maybe it was when he thrusted hard into you, a deep, grunting moan escaping through his parted lips that gave away to the secret you two were sharing on the sofa, but your friends in the room didn\u2019t quite hide their shock. </p><p>\u201cOh, no they are<i> not</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, fucking way!\u201d</p><p>Oh, but yes, fucking way. They could judge the two of you all they wanted, but they were also the ones who never left the room. <br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he breathed, spanking a hand over your ass with a bellowing smack. \u201cRide daddy\u2019s cock\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>223 days since you met, 223 days since your first fuck, and 223 days since you found out he had a bit of daddy kink running wild through his blood. </p><p>\u201cDoes daddy like it when I squeeze his cock?\u201d You could feel him twitch deep inside your stomach.</p><p>\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t like a tease.\u201d <i>Li</i>e. Daddy most certainly loved a little teasing now and then, which is how you ended up on the sofa in the first place. 223 days ago. </p><p>You deeply pitied whoever had the room next to yours. </p><p>If it wasn\u2019t the wet smacking that would send angered knocking at your guys\u2019 door, it sure as hell would be the incredulous moaning. </p><p>\u201cFuck, daddy! Fuck me harder!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Right there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum\u2014I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d</p><p>But who could blame you? You were just two kids in love. <br></p><p>*</p><p>When you ask him about the events that transpired that evening, he will merely blush and turn away. He doesn\u2019t talk about how he barely could catch his own breath and worried about the location of his inhaler, nor does he mention how he came before you, his adrenaline rushing and pulsing and sending him to a blissful oblivion without any care in the world. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care; you were still taking him back home that night. </p><p>By the time the two of you were finished, only a few faces remained around. They didn\u2019t glance your way when Harry leaned up to tuck himself back in his pants, nor did they say anything when you stood up had to cup your crotch with your dress so no leakage would spill down your legs. </p><p>He kissed your temple, his legs weak themselves, and went on a hunt to find Alexa and wish her another happy birthday. You found your purse, your keys still tucked away, and a few beats later, the two of you were scurrying off back to your abode. </p><p>He was very apologetic about leaving you without an orgasm, and he made sure you knew. </p><p>\u201cNot how you treat a lady, is it?\u201d</p><p>Your favorite part of the story is what happens just after this. You were finally free of that dress, something you had been dreaming of most of the evening. Your heels were discarded elsewhere, and Harry took initiative on what would be done with your delicates. </p><p>He felt it would be a crime to leave them on. You agreed. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should leave this bed until you\u2019re lying in a puddle\u2026 What d\u2019ya say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d It was faint, but he perked up like a dog hearing his bag of treats being opened in the other room. He looked angry; his brows were tightly knitted together, and he had pulled his lip between his teeth like a snarl. </p><p>The woman before him was opening him up to things he never knew he loved. </p><p>\u201cGet on your hands and knees.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d</p><p><i>Slap</i>. </p><p>By the next morning, your bottom was as red as an apple. You\u2019d lost count on how many spankings you took, but that was the point. You wanted to push this boy to places you knew he had never been, and by the end of the night, he laid in your bed with soaking hair, a glistening chest, and a drooping cock that could fuck no more. </p><p>\u201cTell me, have I been the best fuck of your life?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, but you saw his cock twice at your words. His dimple popped, and he peeked at you through his lashes with a little twinkle. </p><p>\u201cYou, my love, are the best fuck of my life.\u201d</p><p>If Harry were to ask his thirteen-year-old self what it would be like to fuck the girl from the magazines, he would say it would be like winning the jackpot, and he could tell himself now it was very much the same. He has all the money in the world, more than a man could ever need, and that night with you meant more to him than every dollar in his back account combined. </p><p>So, by the next morning, when he woke to you standing bare in front of him, nudging his shoulder, your makeup still smeared from the night before, he was already planning in his head all the place she wanted to fuck you that day. </p><p>Kitchen sex while the pancakes cooked? Laundry room sex while you separated your darks from your whites? Bathroom sex while you brushed your teeth?</p><p>\u201cHey, I got some meetings to get to today, so\u2026\u201d He knew that sound. He felt his stomach drop and splatter all over the floor. The sound of, \u201cHey, last night was fun, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was great\u2014\u201d<i> Fuck.</i> \u201cI, um\u2026we should do it again sometime, yeah?\u201d <i>Fuck!</i></p><p>His heart was breaking right in front of you, and you were too blind to see it. This boy had been in love with you for years now, and he dreamed to one day share with you everyday what the two of you shared that previous night, but all you were to him was\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll be straight with you. I think you deserve that, yeah? You\u2019re great, you really are. So sweet, and charming. But I\u2019m not wanting anything serious, or\u2026anything. Just got out of a relationship, and just needed some fun. You feel me?\u201d</p><p><i>You feel me?</i> He would be mocking that the rest of the day. </p><p>\u201cI can call a cab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He tore the sheets from his body, and was quick to get up and search for his clothes. You didn\u2019t say another word as he got dressed, picked up his phone, and was out the door. <br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, yeah?\u201d You rested your head on his chest, listening to the beating like a little drum. \u201cHow about I stay with you the rest of the tour? Be your personal groupie?\u201d</p><p>He was silent, but he lifted his leg to wrap around your own, running his foot up and down your calf. </p><p>\u201cYou have me all day tomorrow, don\u2019t forget. I leave the morning of the 22nd.\u201d </p><p>Fans would say the next day that Harry was sick, and it was quite obvious, but in reality, the painful, battering ache that blasted itself on repeat in his head only made it hard to smile at a crowd that night. If he could have it his way, he would love to run away with you and forget everything. As happy as performing made him, there was a woman who made him just a little happier.<br></p>",

Don\u2019t thank me.</b></p><p>June 20, 2014<br>Paris, France</p><p>You can hear him in the bathroom \u2013 the low hum of his voice clamoring over the showerhead, singing a song about running away with your girl \u2013 and you think that maybe there was some hidden truth somewhere in his words. How, so easily, you can just pack your bags and run away \u2013 cutting your hair, changing your names. You\u2019d send postcards home, detailing your adventures, and each night you\u2019d find yourselves knotted beneath the sheets, and the world would never know. </p><p>You would have disappeared, gone with the wind, and the only thing they would be left with is your memory. </p><p>To your left, laying beside a pair of your knickers, is an empty champagne bottle. He was quick to pop it open, nearly taking out one of the bedside table lamps with his incoordination with the cork, and in nearly a few minutes, the bottle was sucked dry, and thrown carelessly over your shoulder. </p><p>He couldn\u2019t get his hands on you quick enough; it was like he was a child again unwrapping the biggest present under the tree on Christmas day. He started with unbuttoning your shirt, and only managed a few before trying his luck with your trousers. You could say with confidence he was a patient man, but when it came to you, all patience was lost in the haste to get you naked and on top of him as possible. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019cock\u2019s been hard since the bloody show,\u201d and he wasn\u2019t wrong. When he caught sight of you standing off on the side of the stage, peeking your head from around the curtain, he felt every ounce of blood fall directly to his cock, and he spent the remainder of the show certain his bulge was going to rip through his pants. \u201cSuck me, please. Need that pretty mouth.\u201d</p><p>You knew his mother raised him right when he still used manners when he wanted you to suck him off.</p>[[MORE]]<p>You loved his cock, and you felt strange to even think such a thing because\u2026well, a cock is a cock. A bit strange looking, flaccid or not, but you somehow found a love with the man who knew how to work it in just the right ways, and thus, you somehow could say you loved the cock itself.</p><p>You also loved the way his ego soared when you would tell him such things. How he would stall for a moment, letting the words sink in and marinate in his gut, \u201cYeah, she does fucking love my cock, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d He would pull back, watching himself slide out, glistening with your wet, and slam himself back in until he felt himself reach your stomach. He loved that confidence you gave him, as if he was the best fuck of your life. </p><p>And you could say with your very own confidence that he very much was.</p><p>It\u2019s been 223 days since the two of you met \u2013 7 months and 11 days to be exact \u2013 in the bathroom of Alexa Chung\u2019s house. It was his fault, if we are pointing blame at anyone, for not locking the door behind him. Maybe it would have been different if he even knew you would be attending that night, but maybe he was left out of the loop for a reason. Everyone knows Harry likes surprises. </p><p>He was mid-wee when you walked in, scuffling your heels through the threshold, until you caught sight of him, standing with his cock out, staring at you like a deer in headlights. </p><p>\u201cFuck\u2014oh, shit, sorry!\u201d And gone you were, just as hastily as you appeared. </p><p>Over the years, he fantasized over every outcome and scenario of the events of finally meeting you. Sometimes it would be at an award show, and others it would be backstage at one of your shows \u2013 if he ever found the time to attend one. \u00a0Not in a million years would be ever dream of your first encounter to be while he was in the middle of taking a piss. </p><p>But, he\u2019s just thankful it wasn\u2019t a #2.</p><p>He was quick to finish up, run his hands under the tap, and fling himself out the door, scanning over the numerous heads for the one who just involuntarily saw his cock. </p><p><i>Was she impressed?</i></p><p>You found yourself in the upstairs toilet, putting on a secondary coat of lipstick before dabbing at it with a piece of toilet roll. Your reflection said you were tired; if it wasn\u2019t the bags under your eyes that gave it away, it was your inability to hear a partygoer on the other side of the door knocking impatiently. </p><p>\u201cHow much longer now? I need\u2019a wee!\u201d</p><p>Sometimes when you share yourself with the entire world, five minutes to yourself, alone in a stranger\u2019s bathroom, is all you need to get yourself through the rest of the night. </p><p>It was no other than Kelly Osbourne on the other side of the door, and you wouldn\u2019t know that if it wasn\u2019t for her father. A fan, you are, but also you just love stories of people snorting ants and licking up piss. You would give an arm and a leg to sit down and talk to Ozzy Osbourne, one of the kings of rock in your eyes. If you could have it your way, you would aboard his crazy train any day.</p><p>You bound down the stairs, make an immediate left, scanter through the dining room, until you see him, standing in the kitchen beside Nick, a glass of whisky in his hand. He doesn\u2019t initially see you, and that gives you time to wonder how you\u2019ll even approach him. </p><p>\u201cHey, sorry I walked in on you peeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum didn\u2019t teach me to knock before entering a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of drunk; I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d</p><p>But it was Nick who saw you first. </p><p>\u201cEyyy, there she is!\u201d He swayed on his feet, pushing the bowl into Harry\u2019s remaining hand, and staggered over to the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t tell \u2018arry, but he\u2019s been talking \u2018bout you all night.\u201d</p><p>You glance over his shoulder to see him taking a sip of his drink, his brows tightly pulled together. </p><p>\u201cY\u2019probably have me mixed up with someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Arry, mate! Look who I found.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened as Nick guided me over, an arm swung over my shoulders, and he sat his glass down to reach his hand out. </p><p>\u201cKinda already met ear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I saw your penis.\u201d The words flew out your lips quicker than you could tell yourself to shut up, but\u2026you weren\u2019t entirely wrong. You did see something, not meaning to, but you did. \u201cSorry I walked in on you\u2026 Mum didn\u2019t teach me manners.\u201d</p><p>Harry stared back at me blankly, his mouth gaped open like a fish, his hand still sitting in the air between us. I took a light hold and shook it. </p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d But deep down, he wanted to crawl beneath the floorboards and die.</p><p>You know him, just like the rest of the world. One of the five members of One Direction, and probably the most talked about in the media. News outlets love him, love getting any scoop they can find \u2013 more so fiction than not \u2013 and you know any word that gets out about the encounter the pair of you had just minutes before, it will be headlines the next day. </p><p><i>\u201cThis just in: Who walked in on Harry Styles taking a wee? The answer will shock you!\u201d</i></p><p>You recognize him from more than just magazines. You\u2019re fairly positive you\u2019ve bumped into him before backstage earlier this year at the Teens Choice Awards. Just a seconds encounter, and you were off being dragged into another direction; you were certain he wouldn\u2019t even remember such an event. </p><p>Little did you know, he thought about the way your arm brushed his for at least a month. </p><p>He was taller in person, or so you thought; long, slender legs squeezed into a pair of the tightest jeans he could possibly find. You think his quaff added a couple extra inches, but you weren\u2019t counting. </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you before, a few months ago? Teens Choice?\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly tackled me backstage? Yeah, I remember.\u201d He put the brim of the drink to his lips, a smirk hiding just behind the glass. </p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m such an asshole to you.\u201d And you meant it, but you weren\u2019t expecting him to nearly choke on his drink. </p><p>He was cute, you couldn\u2019t deny these facts. No wonder the media loved to engage him with every woman he ever merely glanced at. </p><p>\u201cLet me get you a drink,\u201d he set his glass down, turning around to fetch another in the cupboard. \u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d For most of the night, you\u2019ve just taken sips out of random glasses from whoever you spoke to. You think you saw Alexa with a glass of champagne, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a bottle in sight. \u201cVodka and cranberry is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka and cranberry it is.\u201d</p><p>You met him at 9:54 that evening, and by 11:02 you learned that his lips tasted like Jim Beam and maple syrup.<br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cRemember the night we met?\u201d</p><p>Harry pulled with his teeth a ponytail holder from his wrist \u2013 one that you were certain he had knicked from your luggage \u2013 and turned just enough that he could see you from the corner of his eye. </p><p>\u201cDo I remember the best night of my life? Yes, in fact, I do.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s told you on many occasions that despite that night not being the night the two of you decided a relationship was the road you wanted to be on, he still counts that as a night to remember. It began with a snog in the upstairs bathroom, which turned into you rubbing him through his pants, which led you to the downstairs sitting room where you resided the remainder of the night. </p><p>\u201cWhy the sofa? Was the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedroom taken? Yes.\u201d He smirked. \u201cWho it was, we will never know.\u201d </p><p>And to this remaining day, the question is still hung in the air on who fucked in that upstairs bedroom. </p><p>\u201cIt <i>was</i> a good night. No denying that.\u201d You leaned back in the bed, kicking your knickers off and throwing them with a little toss off the bed. \u201cI remember how eager you were to get me back to my place.\u201d </p><p>\u201cBloody eager? I had been dreaming of that night for years. I would have railed you in an alleyway if it meant I could have you again.\u201d</p><p>A little sarcastic, yes, but you knew him too well to test the truth. </p><p>You watched him walk from the bathroom to the front of the bed, reaching down to discard of his bottoms, his eyes never once leaving the dripping pulse between your legs. </p><p>\u201cI fucking love that juicy cunt of yours.\u201d He slid up, resting on his elbows, and used an arm to spread your legs farther. \u201cCould fuck you all day and you\u2019d still be dripping for me.\u201d</p><p>He loves to take his time, kissing and biting and sucking, leaving small patches of blossomed red skin all down your legs, but tonight his tongue was quick, like a rattlesnake going for its prey. His palms held your thighs apart, exposing your center in all its glistening glory. </p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d<br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cJust wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.\u201d He breathed into your neck, gently kissing just under your ear. His hands have been taped to your side for an hour now, pushing your center over the bulge in his pants. \u201cJust wanna fuck\u2026\u201d</p><p>You could feel him giggle into your neck, pecking little kisses over the small, red path he had taken a bite out of. </p><p>\u201cAre you hungry for something?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, fiddling with your waist, digging his fingers into your flesh before reaching down to fondle your thighs. You look down just in time to see crescent marks imbedded in your skin. </p><p>\u201cYou want to show me how good you can fuck me?\u201d</p><p>It would be his pleasure. </p><p>All it took was for him to unbutton his pants, wiggling slightly to push them down just far enough to remove his cock, and you lifted up on your knees to hover of him just right. Your breathing hitched as you felt the tip prod around your center, and you reached down to help guide him right where he wanted to be. </p><p>From the others in the room, the act didn\u2019t appear to be any strange of the sort; they probably weren\u2019t paying much attention, if anyone was being honest. You were hovered over his lap, fiddling with something in between the two of you, until you were sat back down and remained there for a beat. </p><p>You reached down where the two of you were connected, feeling his cock right where he met into you, and smiled, letting out a little giggle before falling onto his chest. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re actually having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>And boy, did those words hit him like a fucking freight train. He was having <i>sex</i> with you. His <i>cock</i> was <i>inside</i> of you. He had met you just a few hours before, and his biggest worry then was having to confront you after you walked in on him in the loo, and now here he was, sitting with you on top his cock in a room full of people. </p><p>\u201cYou feel like a fucking dream,\u201d he ran his fingers up your back and up your shoulders until he held you tight against him. \u201cA really good, fucking dream.\u201d</p><p>You sat there while he held you, listening to the thud of his heart pounding against his chest like it was begging to be released. His breathing was tight, and his hands shook as they trailed back down to your waist. </p><p>You couldn\u2019t get over the burn, the stretch of your flesh wrapping around him. You\u2019ve felt things similar before, but he was an entire new game to play. You wanted to move \u2013 you needed some sort of stimulation \u2013 but despite the fogginess in your brain, you knew eyes would be glued to you, and then the headlines tomorrow would read, <i>\u201cWho did Harry Styles fuck on a sofa at Alexa Chung\u2019s birthday party?\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda between places right now\u2026 Was gonna crash at Nick\u2019s when we left\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna come to mine? It\u2019s still fairly new\u2026 Packing boxes, and what have you.\u201d You shrug, leaning up just enough to grind your hips against his. His pubes gave just the right amount of stimulation to your clit, and it sent a shock all throughout your body. \u201cMy bed is unpacked, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019a fucked\u2019ya on the floor if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And in a whirlwind, you were flipped onto your back, your head hitting the leather cushion with a light thud, and he was back on top of you, reaching between his legs to fill that sweet cunt up once again. </p><p>Maybe it was after he tossed you off of him, exposing himself in the process, or maybe it was when he thrusted hard into you, a deep, grunting moan escaping through his parted lips that gave away to the secret you two were sharing on the sofa, but your friends in the room didn\u2019t quite hide their shock. </p><p>\u201cOh, no they are<i> not</i>!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, fucking way!\u201d</p><p>Oh, but yes, fucking way. They could judge the two of you all they wanted, but they were also the ones who never left the room. <br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he breathed, spanking a hand over your ass with a bellowing smack. \u201cRide daddy\u2019s cock\u2026 That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>223 days since you met, 223 days since your first fuck, and 223 days since you found out he had a bit of daddy kink running wild through his blood. </p><p>\u201cDoes daddy like it when I squeeze his cock?\u201d You could feel him twitch deep inside your stomach.</p><p>\u201cDaddy doesn\u2019t like a tease.\u201d <i>Li</i>e. Daddy most certainly loved a little teasing now and then, which is how you ended up on the sofa in the first place. 223 days ago. </p><p>You deeply pitied whoever had the room next to yours. </p><p>If it wasn\u2019t the wet smacking that would send angered knocking at your guys\u2019 door, it sure as hell would be the incredulous moaning. </p><p>\u201cFuck, daddy! Fuck me harder!\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Right there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna cum\u2014I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d</p><p>But who could blame you? You were just two kids in love. <br></p><p>*</p><p>When you ask him about the events that transpired that evening, he will merely blush and turn away. He doesn\u2019t talk about how he barely could catch his own breath and worried about the location of his inhaler, nor does he mention how he came before you, his adrenaline rushing and pulsing and sending him to a blissful oblivion without any care in the world. </p><p>You didn\u2019t care; you were still taking him back home that night. </p><p>By the time the two of you were finished, only a few faces remained around. They didn\u2019t glance your way when Harry leaned up to tuck himself back in his pants, nor did they say anything when you stood up had to cup your crotch with your dress so no leakage would spill down your legs. </p><p>He kissed your temple, his legs weak themselves, and went on a hunt to find Alexa and wish her another happy birthday. You found your purse, your keys still tucked away, and a few beats later, the two of you were scurrying off back to your abode. </p><p>He was very apologetic about leaving you without an orgasm, and he made sure you knew. </p><p>\u201cNot how you treat a lady, is it?\u201d</p><p>Your favorite part of the story is what happens just after this. You were finally free of that dress, something you had been dreaming of most of the evening. Your heels were discarded elsewhere, and Harry took initiative on what would be done with your delicates. </p><p>He felt it would be a crime to leave them on. You agreed. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should leave this bed until you\u2019re lying in a puddle\u2026 What d\u2019ya say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d It was faint, but he perked up like a dog hearing his bag of treats being opened in the other room. He looked angry; his brows were tightly knitted together, and he had pulled his lip between his teeth like a snarl. </p><p>The woman before him was opening him up to things he never knew he loved. </p><p>\u201cGet on your hands and knees.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYes, daddy.\u201d</p><p><i>Slap</i>. </p><p>By the next morning, your bottom was as red as an apple. You\u2019d lost count on how many spankings you took, but that was the point. You wanted to push this boy to places you knew he had never been, and by the end of the night, he laid in your bed with soaking hair, a glistening chest, and a drooping cock that could fuck no more. </p><p>\u201cTell me, have I been the best fuck of your life?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, but you saw his cock twice at your words. His dimple popped, and he peeked at you through his lashes with a little twinkle. </p><p>\u201cYou, my love, are the best fuck of my life.\u201d</p><p>If Harry were to ask his thirteen-year-old self what it would be like to fuck the girl from the magazines, he would say it would be like winning the jackpot, and he could tell himself now it was very much the same. He has all the money in the world, more than a man could ever need, and that night with you meant more to him than every dollar in his back account combined. </p><p>So, by the next morning, when he woke to you standing bare in front of him, nudging his shoulder, your makeup still smeared from the night before, he was already planning in his head all the place she wanted to fuck you that day. </p><p>Kitchen sex while the pancakes cooked? Laundry room sex while you separated your darks from your whites? Bathroom sex while you brushed your teeth?</p><p>\u201cHey, I got some meetings to get to today, so\u2026\u201d He knew that sound. He felt his stomach drop and splatter all over the floor. The sound of, \u201cHey, last night was fun, but\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was great\u2014\u201d<i> Fuck.</i> \u201cI, um\u2026we should do it again sometime, yeah?\u201d <i>Fuck!</i></p><p>His heart was breaking right in front of you, and you were too blind to see it. This boy had been in love with you for years now, and he dreamed to one day share with you everyday what the two of you shared that previous night, but all you were to him was\u2014</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll be straight with you. I think you deserve that, yeah? You\u2019re great, you really are. So sweet, and charming. But I\u2019m not wanting anything serious, or\u2026anything. Just got out of a relationship, and just needed some fun. You feel me?\u201d</p><p><i>You feel me?</i> He would be mocking that the rest of the day. </p><p>\u201cI can call a cab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He tore the sheets from his body, and was quick to get up and search for his clothes. You didn\u2019t say another word as he got dressed, picked up his phone, and was out the door. <br></p><p>*</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, yeah?\u201d You rested your head on his chest, listening to the beating like a little drum. \u201cHow about I stay with you the rest of the tour? Be your personal groupie?\u201d</p><p>He was silent, but he lifted his leg to wrap around your own, running his foot up and down your calf. </p><p>\u201cYou have me all day tomorrow, don\u2019t forget. I leave the morning of the 22nd.\u201d </p><p>Fans would say the next day that Harry was sick, and it was quite obvious, but in reality, the painful, battering ache that blasted itself on repeat in his head only made it hard to smile at a crowd that night. If he could have it his way, he would love to run away with you and forget everything. As happy as performing made him, there was a woman who made him just a little happier.<br></p>",
                "content": "<p><b>The iconique sofa fuck and hotel fuck in one chapter? Don&rsquo;t thank me.</b></p><p>June 20, 2014<br />Paris, France</p><p>You can hear him in the bathroom &ndash; the low hum of his voice clamoring over the showerhead, singing a song about running away with your girl &ndash; and you think that maybe there was some hidden truth somewhere in his words. How, so easily, you can just pack your bags and run away &ndash; cutting your hair, changing your names. You&rsquo;d send postcards home, detailing your adventures, and each night you&rsquo;d find yourselves knotted beneath the sheets, and the world would never know. </p><p>You would have disappeared, gone with the wind, and the only thing they would be left with is your memory. </p><p>To your left, laying beside a pair of your knickers, is an empty champagne bottle. He was quick to pop it open, nearly taking out one of the bedside table lamps with his incoordination with the cork, and in nearly a few minutes, the bottle was sucked dry, and thrown carelessly over your shoulder. </p><p>He couldn&rsquo;t get his hands on you quick enough; it was like he was a child again unwrapping the biggest present under the tree on Christmas day. He started with unbuttoning your shirt, and only managed a few before trying his luck with your trousers. You could say with confidence he was a patient man, but when it came to you, all patience was lost in the haste to get you naked and on top of him as possible. </p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;cock&rsquo;s been hard since the bloody show,&rdquo; and he wasn&rsquo;t wrong. When he caught sight of you standing off on the side of the stage, peeking your head from around the curtain, he felt every ounce of blood fall directly to his cock, and he spent the remainder of the show certain his bulge was going to rip through his pants. &ldquo;Suck me, please. Need that pretty mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>You knew his mother raised him right when he still used manners when he wanted you to suck him off.</p><p>You loved his cock, and you felt strange to even think such a thing because&hellip;well, a cock is a cock. A bit strange looking, flaccid or not, but you somehow found a love with the man who knew how to work it in just the right ways, and thus, you somehow could say you loved the cock itself.</p><p>You also loved the way his ego soared when you would tell him such things. How he would stall for a moment, letting the words sink in and marinate in his gut, &ldquo;Yeah, she does fucking love my cock, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; He would pull back, watching himself slide out, glistening with your wet, and slam himself back in until he felt himself reach your stomach. He loved that confidence you gave him, as if he was the best fuck of your life. </p><p>And you could say with your very own confidence that he very much was.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been 223 days since the two of you met &ndash; 7 months and 11 days to be exact &ndash; in the bathroom of Alexa Chung&rsquo;s house. It was his fault, if we are pointing blame at anyone, for not locking the door behind him. Maybe it would have been different if he even knew you would be attending that night, but maybe he was left out of the loop for a reason. Everyone knows Harry likes surprises. </p><p>He was mid-wee when you walked in, scuffling your heels through the threshold, until you caught sight of him, standing with his cock out, staring at you like a deer in headlights. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&mdash;oh, shit, sorry!&rdquo; And gone you were, just as hastily as you appeared. </p><p>Over the years, he fantasized over every outcome and scenario of the events of finally meeting you. Sometimes it would be at an award show, and others it would be backstage at one of your shows &ndash; if he ever found the time to attend one. &nbsp;Not in a million years would be ever dream of your first encounter to be while he was in the middle of taking a piss. </p><p>But, he&rsquo;s just thankful it wasn&rsquo;t a #2.</p><p>He was quick to finish up, run his hands under the tap, and fling himself out the door, scanning over the numerous heads for the one who just involuntarily saw his cock. </p><p><i>Was she impressed?</i></p><p>You found yourself in the upstairs toilet, putting on a secondary coat of lipstick before dabbing at it with a piece of toilet roll. Your reflection said you were tired; if it wasn&rsquo;t the bags under your eyes that gave it away, it was your inability to hear a partygoer on the other side of the door knocking impatiently. </p><p>&ldquo;How much longer now? I need&rsquo;a wee!&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes when you share yourself with the entire world, five minutes to yourself, alone in a stranger&rsquo;s bathroom, is all you need to get yourself through the rest of the night. </p><p>It was no other than Kelly Osbourne on the other side of the door, and you wouldn&rsquo;t know that if it wasn&rsquo;t for her father. A fan, you are, but also you just love stories of people snorting ants and licking up piss. You would give an arm and a leg to sit down and talk to Ozzy Osbourne, one of the kings of rock in your eyes. If you could have it your way, you would aboard his crazy train any day.</p><p>You bound down the stairs, make an immediate left, scanter through the dining room, until you see him, standing in the kitchen beside Nick, a glass of whisky in his hand. He doesn&rsquo;t initially see you, and that gives you time to wonder how you&rsquo;ll even approach him. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey, sorry I walked in on you peeing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mum didn&rsquo;t teach me to knock before entering a room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of drunk; I&rsquo;m not gonna lie.&rdquo;</p><p>But it was Nick who saw you first. </p><p>&ldquo;Eyyy, there she is!&rdquo; He swayed on his feet, pushing the bowl into Harry&rsquo;s remaining hand, and staggered over to the doorway. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell &lsquo;arry, but he&rsquo;s been talking &lsquo;bout you all night.&rdquo;</p><p>You glance over his shoulder to see him taking a sip of his drink, his brows tightly pulled together. </p><p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;probably have me mixed up with someone&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Arry, mate! Look who I found.&rdquo;</p><p>His jaw tightened as Nick guided me over, an arm swung over my shoulders, and he sat his glass down to reach his hand out. </p><p>&ldquo;Kinda already met ear&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I saw your penis.&rdquo; The words flew out your lips quicker than you could tell yourself to shut up, but&hellip;you weren&rsquo;t entirely wrong. You did see something, not meaning to, but you did. &ldquo;Sorry I walked in on you&hellip; Mum didn&rsquo;t teach me manners.&rdquo;</p><p>Harry stared back at me blankly, his mouth gaped open like a fish, his hand still sitting in the air between us. I took a light hold and shook it. </p><p>&ldquo;Right. Yeah. It&rsquo;s not a problem.&rdquo; But deep down, he wanted to crawl beneath the floorboards and die.</p><p>You know him, just like the rest of the world. One of the five members of One Direction, and probably the most talked about in the media. News outlets love him, love getting any scoop they can find &ndash; more so fiction than not &ndash; and you know any word that gets out about the encounter the pair of you had just minutes before, it will be headlines the next day. </p><p><i>&ldquo;This just in: Who walked in on Harry Styles taking a wee? The answer will shock you!&rdquo;</i></p><p>You recognize him from more than just magazines. You&rsquo;re fairly positive you&rsquo;ve bumped into him before backstage earlier this year at the Teens Choice Awards. Just a seconds encounter, and you were off being dragged into another direction; you were certain he wouldn&rsquo;t even remember such an event. </p><p>Little did you know, he thought about the way your arm brushed his for at least a month. </p><p>He was taller in person, or so you thought; long, slender legs squeezed into a pair of the tightest jeans he could possibly find. You think his quaff added a couple extra inches, but you weren&rsquo;t counting. </p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve seen you before, a few months ago? Teens Choice?&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly tackled me backstage? Yeah, I remember.&rdquo; He put the brim of the drink to his lips, a smirk hiding just behind the glass. </p><p>&ldquo;Sorry I&rsquo;m such an asshole to you.&rdquo; And you meant it, but you weren&rsquo;t expecting him to nearly choke on his drink. </p><p>He was cute, you couldn&rsquo;t deny these facts. No wonder the media loved to engage him with every woman he ever merely glanced at. </p><p>&ldquo;Let me get you a drink,&rdquo; he set his glass down, turning around to fetch another in the cupboard. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your poison?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; For most of the night, you&rsquo;ve just taken sips out of random glasses from whoever you spoke to. You think you saw Alexa with a glass of champagne, but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be a bottle in sight. &ldquo;Vodka and cranberry is fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vodka and cranberry it is.&rdquo;</p><p>You met him at 9:54 that evening, and by 11:02 you learned that his lips tasted like Jim Beam and maple syrup.<br /></p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Remember the night we met?&rdquo;</p><p>Harry pulled with his teeth a ponytail holder from his wrist &ndash; one that you were certain he had knicked from your luggage &ndash; and turned just enough that he could see you from the corner of his eye. </p><p>&ldquo;Do I remember the best night of my life? Yes, in fact, I do.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s told you on many occasions that despite that night not being the night the two of you decided a relationship was the road you wanted to be on, he still counts that as a night to remember. It began with a snog in the upstairs bathroom, which turned into you rubbing him through his pants, which led you to the downstairs sitting room where you resided the remainder of the night. </p><p>&ldquo;Why the sofa? Was the&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bedroom taken? Yes.&rdquo; He smirked. &ldquo;Who it was, we will never know.&rdquo; </p><p>And to this remaining day, the question is still hung in the air on who fucked in that upstairs bedroom. </p><p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> a good night. No denying that.&rdquo; You leaned back in the bed, kicking your knickers off and throwing them with a little toss off the bed. &ldquo;I remember how eager you were to get me back to my place.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Bloody eager? I had been dreaming of that night for years. I would have railed you in an alleyway if it meant I could have you again.&rdquo;</p><p>A little sarcastic, yes, but you knew him too well to test the truth. </p><p>You watched him walk from the bathroom to the front of the bed, reaching down to discard of his bottoms, his eyes never once leaving the dripping pulse between your legs. </p><p>&ldquo;I fucking love that juicy cunt of yours.&rdquo; He slid up, resting on his elbows, and used an arm to spread your legs farther. &ldquo;Could fuck you all day and you&rsquo;d still be dripping for me.&rdquo;</p><p>He loves to take his time, kissing and biting and sucking, leaving small patches of blossomed red skin all down your legs, but tonight his tongue was quick, like a rattlesnake going for its prey. His palms held your thighs apart, exposing your center in all its glistening glory. </p><p>&ldquo;Just wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;Just wanna fuck that pretty pussy of yours.&rdquo; He breathed into your neck, gently kissing just under your ear. His hands have been taped to your side for an hour now, pushing your center over the bulge in his pants. &ldquo;Just wanna fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You could feel him giggle into your neck, pecking little kisses over the small, red path he had taken a bite out of. </p><p>&ldquo;Are you hungry for something?&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded, fiddling with your waist, digging his fingers into your flesh before reaching down to fondle your thighs. You look down just in time to see crescent marks imbedded in your skin. </p><p>&ldquo;You want to show me how good you can fuck me?&rdquo;</p><p>It would be his pleasure. </p><p>All it took was for him to unbutton his pants, wiggling slightly to push them down just far enough to remove his cock, and you lifted up on your knees to hover of him just right. Your breathing hitched as you felt the tip prod around your center, and you reached down to help guide him right where he wanted to be. </p><p>From the others in the room, the act didn&rsquo;t appear to be any strange of the sort; they probably weren&rsquo;t paying much attention, if anyone was being honest.

His breathing was tight, and his hands shook as they trailed back down to your waist. </p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t get over the burn, the stretch of your flesh wrapping around him.

He doesn&rsquo;t talk about how he barely could catch his own breath and worried about the location of his inhaler, nor does he mention how he came before you, his adrenaline rushing and pulsing and sending him to a blissful oblivion without any care in the world. </p><p>You didn&rsquo;t care; you were still taking him back home that night. </p><p>By the time the two of you were finished, only a few faces remained around. They didn&rsquo;t glance your way when Harry leaned up to tuck himself back in his pants, nor did they say anything when you stood up had to cup your crotch with your dress so no leakage would spill down your legs. </p><p>He kissed your temple, his legs weak themselves, and went on a hunt to find Alexa and wish her another happy birthday. You found your purse, your keys still tucked away, and a few beats later, the two of you were scurrying off back to your abode. </p><p>He was very apologetic about leaving you without an orgasm, and he made sure you knew. </p><p>&ldquo;Not how you treat a lady, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Your favorite part of the story is what happens just after this. You were finally free of that dress, something you had been dreaming of most of the evening. Your heels were discarded elsewhere, and Harry took initiative on what would be done with your delicates. </p><p>He felt it would be a crime to leave them on. You agreed. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should leave this bed until you&rsquo;re lying in a puddle&hellip; What d&rsquo;ya say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, daddy.&rdquo; It was faint, but he perked up like a dog hearing his bag of treats being opened in the other room. He looked angry; his brows were tightly knitted together, and he had pulled his lip between his teeth like a snarl. </p><p>The woman before him was opening him up to things he never knew he loved. </p><p>&ldquo;Get on your hands and knees.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yes, daddy.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Slap</i>. </p><p>By the next morning, your bottom was as red as an apple. You&rsquo;d lost count on how many spankings you took, but that was the point. You wanted to push this boy to places you knew he had never been, and by the end of the night, he laid in your bed with soaking hair, a glistening chest, and a drooping cock that could fuck no more. </p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, have I been the best fuck of your life?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes were closed, but you saw his cock twice at your words. His dimple popped, and he peeked at you through his lashes with a little twinkle. </p><p>&ldquo;You, my love, are the best fuck of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>If Harry were to ask his thirteen-year-old self what it would be like to fuck the girl from the magazines, he would say it would be like winning the jackpot, and he could tell himself now it was very much the same. He has all the money in the world, more than a man could ever need, and that night with you meant more to him than every dollar in his back account combined. </p><p>So, by the next morning, when he woke to you standing bare in front of him, nudging his shoulder, your makeup still smeared from the night before, he was already planning in his head all the place she wanted to fuck you that day. </p><p>Kitchen sex while the pancakes cooked? Laundry room sex while you separated your darks from your whites? Bathroom sex while you brushed your teeth?</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, I got some meetings to get to today, so&hellip;&rdquo; He knew that sound. He felt his stomach drop and splatter all over the floor. The sound of, &ldquo;Hey, last night was fun, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Last night was great&mdash;&rdquo;<i> Fuck.</i> &ldquo;I, um&hellip;we should do it again sometime, yeah?&rdquo; <i>Fuck!</i></p><p>His heart was breaking right in front of you, and you were too blind to see it. This boy had been in love with you for years now, and he dreamed to one day share with you everyday what the two of you shared that previous night, but all you were to him was&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ll be straight with you. I think you deserve that, yeah? You&rsquo;re great, you really are. So sweet, and charming. But I&rsquo;m not wanting anything serious, or&hellip;anything. Just got out of a relationship, and just needed some fun. You feel me?&rdquo;</p><p><i>You feel me?</i> He would be mocking that the rest of the day. </p><p>&ldquo;I can call a cab&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He tore the sheets from his body, and was quick to get up and search for his clothes. You didn&rsquo;t say another word as he got dressed, picked up his phone, and was out the door. <br /></p><p>*</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, yeah?&rdquo; You rested your head on his chest, listening to the beating like a little drum. &ldquo;How about I stay with you the rest of the tour? Be your personal groupie?&rdquo;</p><p>He was silent, but he lifted his leg to wrap around your own, running his foot up and down your calf. </p><p>&ldquo;You have me all day tomorrow, don&rsquo;t forget. I leave the morning of the 22nd.&rdquo; </p><p>Fans would say the next day that Harry was sick, and it was quite obvious, but in reality, the painful, battering ache that blasted itself on repeat in his head only made it hard to smile at a crowd that night. If he could have it his way, he would love to run away with you and forget everything. As happy as performing made him, there was a woman who made him just a little happier.<br /></p>",

Don&rsquo;t thank me.</b></p>\n<p>June 20, 2014<br />Paris, France</p>\n<p>You can hear him in the bathroom &ndash; the low hum of his voice clamoring over the showerhead, singing a song about running away with your girl &ndash; and you think that maybe there was some hidden truth somewhere in his words. How, so easily, you can just pack your bags and run away &ndash; cutting your hair, changing your names. You&rsquo;d send postcards home, detailing your adventures, and each night you&rsquo;d find yourselves knotted beneath the sheets, and the world would never know. </p>\n<p>You would have disappeared, gone with the wind, and the only thing they would be left with is your memory. </p>\n<p>To your left, laying beside a pair of your knickers, is an empty champagne bottle. He was quick to pop it open, nearly taking out one of the bedside table lamps with his incoordination with the cork, and in nearly a few minutes, the bottle was sucked dry, and thrown carelessly over your shoulder. </p>\n<p>He couldn&rsquo;t get his hands on you quick enough; it was like he was a child again unwrapping the biggest present under the tree on Christmas day. He started with unbuttoning your shirt, and only managed a few before trying his luck with your trousers. You could say with confidence he was a patient man, but when it came to you, all patience was lost in the haste to get you naked and on top of him as possible. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;cock&rsquo;s been hard since the bloody show,&rdquo; and he wasn&rsquo;t wrong. When he caught sight of you standing off on the side of the stage, peeking your head from around the curtain, he felt every ounce of blood fall directly to his cock, and he spent the remainder of the show certain his bulge was going to rip through his pants. &ldquo;Suck me, please. Need that pretty mouth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You knew his mother raised him right when he still used manners when he wanted you to suck him off.</p>\n</p>",
