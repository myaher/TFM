It was in primary school, and it was with a girl called Melanie Hughes. I hope Melanie doesn\u2019t mind me saying that in public. I don\u2019t think she will. She still speaks to me. I couldn\u2019t tell you what age I was. Probably about 11. No, 10.</p><p>Sally Taylor asks: Was it fun being snogged by Billie Piper?</p><p>David Tennant: It\u2019s always fun being snogged by Billie Piper. How could it fail to be? I used to be in a select club - but now she\u2019s done <i>The Secret Diary of a Call Girl</i>, I think every member of Equity has had a go!</p><p>Roxi Fairbank asks: Do you think the Doctor will ever meet Rose again?</p><p>David Tennant: <i>[Thinks] </i>I can\u2019t answer that.

It\u2019s based on the creator\u2019s life. But what makes it compelling is that it cuts from 2006 when Rosie was born and present day. The 2006 stuff is then struggling, while the present day stuff is more then accepting. Plus, they aren\u2019t perfect, they are flawed.",

Olivia had left to sit with Alex only a few minutes ago and now his feet itched. He needed to walk.</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, he was standing outside of Alex\u2019s room. She slept with her back to the door, looking impossibly small under the hospital blankets, Olivia asleep in the chair next to the bed. As he stood there, she rolled onto her back. The sight of her still extended womb almost brought him to his knees. He turned quickly from the sight and made to run. Instead he found himself knocked onto is backside as he collided with another person.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d A tall bald man in nursing scrubs reached out his hand and pulled him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fi- I just - I need -\u201d</p><!-- more --><p>The man\u2019s face was quickly losing focus. He couldn\u2019t breathe. John tried to sidestep the man but found he had to lean on the wall for support. He\u2019d been strong earlier. He\u2019d been there for Olivia as she collapsed in his arms. But now, the painted birds on the wall seemed to fly as his eyes swam and he couldn\u2019t find the strength to hold it in anymore. He felt the nurse\u2019s arms around his shoulders as he was led down the hall away from Alex\u2019s room. He lost track of time. One second he was being eased onto a couch and curling himself into a ball and the next he was being told to sit up.</p><p> \u201cCome on mate, nice deep breaths.\u201d</p><p> He put his head between his knees and tried to control his breathing. He couldn\u2019t seem to get any air into his lungs.</p><p> \u201cIn through your nose. Slow as you can. That\u2019s it. Now out through your mouth. Easy now.\u201d</p><p> Slowly, the black spots in his vision began to fade. He could see the knees of the nurse, kneeling in front of him on the ground. He could feel the wet cloth on the back of his neck.</p><p> \u201cSor- sorry.\u201d He hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Just focus on your breathing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy - my baby. My daughter -\u201d His voice cracked and he hung his head lower, his cries taking over once again.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know mate. Hey. Look at me. Deep breaths again. Don\u2019t want you passing out on us.\u201d</p><p> John repeated the exercise again and slowly sat up in his seat. The nurse stood and filled a cup at the water cooler.</p><p> \u201cThere you go. When you can, start taking some slow sips alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The nurse took a seat in the chair next to him as he took a drink.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Paul. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn. Helm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss John.\u201d</p><p> John pressed his lips together and nodded in acknowledgement, not trusting himself to open his mouth.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re here with Alex and Olivia I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThey wanted to be alone for\u2026 and then Alex&hellip; She didn\u2019t want anyone in there with her.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you John? Anyone you want me to call? There\u2019s a chaplain, he\u2019s a great listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to my rounds,\u201d he said apologetically,\u201cbut if you change your mind, just come by the nurses station yeah? Anything you need, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Paul stood up and pat his shoulder as he crossed to the door.</p><p> \u201cI need to say goodbye.\u201d John muttered to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr hello. Or both.\u201d He looked up, eyes clouded again with tears.</p><p>Paul hesitated.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I just need to see her. I need to see her face. I know Alex doesn\u2019t, but I need to,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><hr><p>Paul understood the dynamic here was tricky. He knew John was the father, but he also knew that Alex hadn\u2019t wanted him or Olivia to be there when she delivered, he heard her say so. He gave John one last look and made his way back to the maternity ward.</p><p>The only other patient currently on the floor was still in the very early stages of labor. He quickly checked her vitals and updated her chart and then made his way back to the nurses station. He looked around, trying to find the one person he knew could help him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Parks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne second Paul. I have to finish filling out Ms. Jones\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she changed her mind? There\u2019s still time. I\u2019ve got the CuddleCot running in the bereavement suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s, that\u2019s the thing. She\u2019s still resting. But\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father wants to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mr. Helm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He almost collapsed in the hallway outside her door. He won\u2019t ask Ms. Jones. He doesn\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks looked deep in thought, but Paul couldn\u2019t get the image of a panic stricken John out of his head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a father. I know the mother\u2019s decision, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she tried to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a father who\u2019s lost his daughter too and he just wants a moment to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded, ready to be chastised.</p><p>\u201cMr. Helm has as much a right as Ms. Jones or Ms. Miller to say goodbye. They made their choice. This is his.\u201d</p><p>Paul heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cIs Mrs. Gerard in 307 still at 3 centimeters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. You go to bereavement and make sure everything is in order. I\u2019ll let Grace know you\u2019re getting things started and I\u2019ll meet her there with Mr. Helm in 20 minutes. Where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in conference room 2. Thank you Dr. Parks.\u201d</p><hr><p>John sat with his head cradled in his hands. He had paced the room for a while after Nurse Paul left, but soon felt too exhausted to do even that. Less than 3 hours ago he was bursting with excitement, ready to meet the love of his life. He had never been so sure about anything in his life. He loved his child. He didn\u2019t care if it was a boy or a girl. He didn\u2019t care that they would live next door. He didn\u2019t even care that Alex was in love with Olivia and not him. He was going to be a dad. Even when Olivia had come out to tell him they had trouble finding the heartbeat, he was sure everything would be fine.</p><p>Then his bubble was burst. His dream shattered. His life had changed in the span of 15 seconds; in just 8 words. \u201cThere\u2019s no heartbeat. The baby\u2019s gone. She\u2019s gone.\u201d He pushed the heels of his hands into eyes as his stomach dropped again at the memory. Olivia\u2019s voice rang in his head, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us in there. She doesn\u2019t want us to see that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be angry with Alex. He knew she was trying to protect him from this but it\u2019s not what he wanted. He wanted to know what his daughter looked like. He wanted to hold her hand and count her toes. He wanted proof that she was here. He could feel the panic rising in his chest again as the door opened. He jumped from his seat as Doctor Parks walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cDr. Parks. Listen. I know Alex said she didn\u2019t want to see her, but I do. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Mr. Helm. I\u2019m going to take you over in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>John sagged back down into the couch. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Helm, before we go in I want to explain what\u2019s going to happen and answer any questions you may have. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yes of course.\u201d</p><p>She took a seat directly across from John and laid a thick folder on the coffee table between them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a few pamphlets in here that you\u2019re welcome to take home with you. They have all of the information I\u2019m about to give you, as well as the names and numbers of services you might need later on.\u201d</p><p>John eyed the folder then quickly nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done here, we\u2019re going to go downstairs. There\u2019s a suite set up for these kind of situations. It\u2019s private and quiet. You can take all the time you need in there. We\u2019ve had people stay for a few minutes, an hour or two, sometimes a few days. It\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where she is right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a special cot.\u201d She took a breath and made sure to maintain eye contact. \u201cThis cot helps keep her body cool. Right now, she still looks very much like a healthy newborn. She\u2019s a bit smaller, being 34 weeks gestation, and her lips and fingernails are a bit darker than normal. This was\u2026 she passed 6 or so hours ago, so there\u2019s no injuries to her skin. For the most part, she\u2019ll just look like she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s breath hitched as he tried to nod his head in understanding.</p><p>\u201cCan - can I hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Take as much or as little time as you want. She\u2019s wrapped in a blanket from the nursery but you can dress her, if you\u2019d like, maybe an outfit you brought from home or something from the nursery?\u201d</p><p>John thought of the small gift bags he\u2019d hidden in the boot of his car last week. A surprise for Alex. He couldn\u2019t bring it in with him earlier without ruining the surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d his voice cracked, \u201cit\u2019s uh- it\u2019s in the car park. Should I get it now? Do I have time?\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks nodded her head. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re done here.\u201d She steeled herself. \u201cLast thing, if you\u2019d like, the maternity care specialist can come in and help you take an imprint of her hands or feet. And if you\u2019re so inclined, the photographer can come and take her portrait for you.\u201d</p><p>John sat back in his seat.</p><p>\u201cAny or all or none. It\u2019s up to you. If you\u2019re more comfortable doing it, you\u2019re more than welcome to take pictures on your phone yourself. I know it may seem odd, but many parents find comfort having these mementos later on. You think about it. Take your time, doesn\u2019t matter how long. You set the pace here John.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say. He raked his hands down his face and leaned his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this is. If there\u2019s anything I can do or if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>He slowly lifted his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Alex and Olivia.\u201d He stood and took a step toward the door. \u201cI mean, unless they want to\u2026 but don\u2019t tell them I have. I don\u2019t want them to hurt any more. They can do what they like, but I need to do this.\u201d He took a deep breath and wiped his nose on his sleeve. \u201cI need to get something out of my car. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks stood as well, picking up the folder and moving to open the door for him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Would you like me to walk down to the exit with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Just\u2026 Where do I\u2026 Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back up to the nurses station. I\u2019ll take you from there.\u201d She opened the door and handed the folder to John. \u201cTake these with you. There\u2019s more in there for Ms. Jones for when she goes home. I\u2019ll give her her own copies when she\u2019s discharged as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Be right back.\u201d</p>",

He couldn\u2019t breathe. John tried to sidestep the man but found he had to lean on the wall for support. He\u2019d been strong earlier. He\u2019d been there for Olivia as she collapsed in his arms. But now, the painted birds on the wall seemed to fly as his eyes swam and he couldn\u2019t find the strength to hold it in anymore. He felt the nurse\u2019s arms around his shoulders as he was led down the hall away from Alex\u2019s room. He lost track of time. One second he was being eased onto a couch and curling himself into a ball and the next he was being told to sit up.</p><p> \u201cCome on mate, nice deep breaths.\u201d</p><p> He put his head between his knees and tried to control his breathing. He couldn\u2019t seem to get any air into his lungs.</p><p> \u201cIn through your nose. Slow as you can. That\u2019s it. Now out through your mouth. Easy now.\u201d</p><p> Slowly, the black spots in his vision began to fade. He could see the knees of the nurse, kneeling in front of him on the ground. He could feel the wet cloth on the back of his neck.</p><p> \u201cSor- sorry.\u201d He hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Just focus on your breathing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy - my baby. My daughter -\u201d His voice cracked and he hung his head lower, his cries taking over once again.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know mate. Hey. Look at me. Deep breaths again. Don\u2019t want you passing out on us.\u201d</p><p> John repeated the exercise again and slowly sat up in his seat. The nurse stood and filled a cup at the water cooler.</p><p> \u201cThere you go. When you can, start taking some slow sips alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The nurse took a seat in the chair next to him as he took a drink.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Paul. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn. Helm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss John.\u201d</p><p> John pressed his lips together and nodded in acknowledgement, not trusting himself to open his mouth.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re here with Alex and Olivia I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThey wanted to be alone for\u2026 and then Alex\u2026 She didn\u2019t want anyone in there with her.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you John? Anyone you want me to call? There\u2019s a chaplain, he\u2019s a great listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to my rounds,\u201d he said apologetically,\u201cbut if you change your mind, just come by the nurses station yeah? Anything you need, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Paul stood up and pat his shoulder as he crossed to the door.</p><p> \u201cI need to say goodbye.\u201d John muttered to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr hello. Or both.\u201d He looked up, eyes clouded again with tears.</p><p>Paul hesitated.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I just need to see her. I need to see her face. I know Alex doesn\u2019t, but I need to,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><hr><p>Paul understood the dynamic here was tricky. He knew John was the father, but he also knew that Alex hadn\u2019t wanted him or Olivia to be there when she delivered, he heard her say so. He gave John one last look and made his way back to the maternity ward.</p><p>The only other patient currently on the floor was still in the very early stages of labor. He quickly checked her vitals and updated her chart and then made his way back to the nurses station. He looked around, trying to find the one person he knew could help him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Parks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne second Paul. I have to finish filling out Ms. Jones\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she changed her mind? There\u2019s still time. I\u2019ve got the CuddleCot running in the bereavement suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s, that\u2019s the thing. She\u2019s still resting. But\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father wants to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mr. Helm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He almost collapsed in the hallway outside her door.

Olivia had left to sit with Alex only a few minutes ago and now his feet itched. He needed to walk.</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, he was standing outside of Alex\u2019s room. She slept with her back to the door, looking impossibly small under the hospital blankets, Olivia asleep in the chair next to the bed. As he stood there, she rolled onto her back. The sight of her still extended womb almost brought him to his knees. He turned quickly from the sight and made to run. Instead he found himself knocked onto is backside as he collided with another person.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d A tall bald man in nursing scrubs reached out his hand and pulled him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fi- I just - I need -\u201d</p>[[MORE]]<p>The man\u2019s face was quickly losing focus. He couldn\u2019t breathe. John tried to sidestep the man but found he had to lean on the wall for support. He\u2019d been strong earlier. He\u2019d been there for Olivia as she collapsed in his arms. But now, the painted birds on the wall seemed to fly as his eyes swam and he couldn\u2019t find the strength to hold it in anymore. He felt the nurse\u2019s arms around his shoulders as he was led down the hall away from Alex\u2019s room. He lost track of time. One second he was being eased onto a couch and curling himself into a ball and the next he was being told to sit up.</p><p> \u201cCome on mate, nice deep breaths.\u201d</p><p> He put his head between his knees and tried to control his breathing. He couldn\u2019t seem to get any air into his lungs.</p><p> \u201cIn through your nose. Slow as you can. That\u2019s it. Now out through your mouth. Easy now.\u201d</p><p> Slowly, the black spots in his vision began to fade. He could see the knees of the nurse, kneeling in front of him on the ground. He could feel the wet cloth on the back of his neck.</p><p> \u201cSor- sorry.\u201d He hiccuped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Just focus on your breathing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy - my baby. My daughter -\u201d His voice cracked and he hung his head lower, his cries taking over once again.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know mate. Hey. Look at me. Deep breaths again. Don\u2019t want you passing out on us.\u201d</p><p> John repeated the exercise again and slowly sat up in his seat. The nurse stood and filled a cup at the water cooler.</p><p> \u201cThere you go. When you can, start taking some slow sips alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The nurse took a seat in the chair next to him as he took a drink.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Paul. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn. Helm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry for your loss John.\u201d</p><p> John pressed his lips together and nodded in acknowledgement, not trusting himself to open his mouth.</p><p> \u201cYou\u2019re here with Alex and Olivia I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cThey wanted to be alone for\u2026 and then Alex\u2026 She didn\u2019t want anyone in there with her.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you John? Anyone you want me to call? There\u2019s a chaplain, he\u2019s a great listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to my rounds,\u201d he said apologetically,\u201cbut if you change your mind, just come by the nurses station yeah? Anything you need, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Paul stood up and pat his shoulder as he crossed to the door.</p><p> \u201cI need to say goodbye.\u201d John muttered to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr hello. Or both.\u201d He looked up, eyes clouded again with tears.</p><p>Paul hesitated.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I just need to see her. I need to see her face. I know Alex doesn\u2019t, but I need to,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><hr><p>Paul understood the dynamic here was tricky. He knew John was the father, but he also knew that Alex hadn\u2019t wanted him or Olivia to be there when she delivered, he heard her say so. He gave John one last look and made his way back to the maternity ward.</p><p>The only other patient currently on the floor was still in the very early stages of labor. He quickly checked her vitals and updated her chart and then made his way back to the nurses station. He looked around, trying to find the one person he knew could help him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Parks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne second Paul. I have to finish filling out Ms. Jones\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she changed her mind? There\u2019s still time. I\u2019ve got the CuddleCot running in the bereavement suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s, that\u2019s the thing. She\u2019s still resting. But\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father wants to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mr. Helm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He almost collapsed in the hallway outside her door. He won\u2019t ask Ms. Jones. He doesn\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks looked deep in thought, but Paul couldn\u2019t get the image of a panic stricken John out of his head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a father. I know the mother\u2019s decision, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul,\u201d she tried to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a father who\u2019s lost his daughter too and he just wants a moment to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded, ready to be chastised.</p><p>\u201cMr. Helm has as much a right as Ms. Jones or Ms. Miller to say goodbye. They made their choice. This is his.\u201d</p><p>Paul heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cIs Mrs. Gerard in 307 still at 3 centimeters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. You go to bereavement and make sure everything is in order. I\u2019ll let Grace know you\u2019re getting things started and I\u2019ll meet her there with Mr. Helm in 20 minutes. Where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in conference room 2. Thank you Dr. Parks.\u201d</p><hr><p>John sat with his head cradled in his hands. He had paced the room for a while after Nurse Paul left, but soon felt too exhausted to do even that. Less than 3 hours ago he was bursting with excitement, ready to meet the love of his life. He had never been so sure about anything in his life. He loved his child. He didn\u2019t care if it was a boy or a girl. He didn\u2019t care that they would live next door. He didn\u2019t even care that Alex was in love with Olivia and not him. He was going to be a dad. Even when Olivia had come out to tell him they had trouble finding the heartbeat, he was sure everything would be fine.</p><p>Then his bubble was burst. His dream shattered. His life had changed in the span of 15 seconds; in just 8 words. \u201cThere\u2019s no heartbeat. The baby\u2019s gone. She\u2019s gone.\u201d He pushed the heels of his hands into eyes as his stomach dropped again at the memory. Olivia\u2019s voice rang in his head, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us in there. She doesn\u2019t want us to see that.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be angry with Alex. He knew she was trying to protect him from this but it\u2019s not what he wanted. He wanted to know what his daughter looked like. He wanted to hold her hand and count her toes. He wanted proof that she was here. He could feel the panic rising in his chest again as the door opened. He jumped from his seat as Doctor Parks walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cDr. Parks. Listen. I know Alex said she didn\u2019t want to see her, but I do. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Mr. Helm. I\u2019m going to take you over in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>John sagged back down into the couch. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Helm, before we go in I want to explain what\u2019s going to happen and answer any questions you may have. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yes of course.\u201d</p><p>She took a seat directly across from John and laid a thick folder on the coffee table between them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a few pamphlets in here that you\u2019re welcome to take home with you. They have all of the information I\u2019m about to give you, as well as the names and numbers of services you might need later on.\u201d</p><p>John eyed the folder then quickly nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done here, we\u2019re going to go downstairs. There\u2019s a suite set up for these kind of situations. It\u2019s private and quiet. You can take all the time you need in there. We\u2019ve had people stay for a few minutes, an hour or two, sometimes a few days. It\u2019s your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where she is right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s a special cot.\u201d She took a breath and made sure to maintain eye contact. \u201cThis cot helps keep her body cool. Right now, she still looks very much like a healthy newborn. She\u2019s a bit smaller, being 34 weeks gestation, and her lips and fingernails are a bit darker than normal. This was\u2026 she passed 6 or so hours ago, so there\u2019s no injuries to her skin. For the most part, she\u2019ll just look like she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s breath hitched as he tried to nod his head in understanding.</p><p>\u201cCan - can I hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Take as much or as little time as you want. She\u2019s wrapped in a blanket from the nursery but you can dress her, if you\u2019d like, maybe an outfit you brought from home or something from the nursery?\u201d</p><p>John thought of the small gift bags he\u2019d hidden in the boot of his car last week. A surprise for Alex. He couldn\u2019t bring it in with him earlier without ruining the surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d his voice cracked, \u201cit\u2019s uh- it\u2019s in the car park. Should I get it now? Do I have time?\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks nodded her head. \u201cAs soon as we\u2019re done here.\u201d She steeled herself. \u201cLast thing, if you\u2019d like, the maternity care specialist can come in and help you take an imprint of her hands or feet. And if you\u2019re so inclined, the photographer can come and take her portrait for you.\u201d</p><p>John sat back in his seat.</p><p>\u201cAny or all or none. It\u2019s up to you. If you\u2019re more comfortable doing it, you\u2019re more than welcome to take pictures on your phone yourself. I know it may seem odd, but many parents find comfort having these mementos later on. You think about it. Take your time, doesn\u2019t matter how long. You set the pace here John.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say. He raked his hands down his face and leaned his elbows on his knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this is. If there\u2019s anything I can do or if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>He slowly lifted his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Alex and Olivia.\u201d He stood and took a step toward the door. \u201cI mean, unless they want to\u2026 but don\u2019t tell them I have. I don\u2019t want them to hurt any more. They can do what they like, but I need to do this.\u201d He took a deep breath and wiped his nose on his sleeve. \u201cI need to get something out of my car. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Parks stood as well, picking up the folder and moving to open the door for him.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Would you like me to walk down to the exit with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Just\u2026 Where do I\u2026 Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back up to the nurses station. I\u2019ll take you from there.\u201d She opened the door and handed the folder to John. \u201cTake these with you. There\u2019s more in there for Ms. Jones for when she goes home. I\u2019ll give her her own copies when she\u2019s discharged as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Be right back.\u201d</p></p>",

We&rsquo;ve had people stay for a few minutes, an hour or two, sometimes a few days. It&rsquo;s your decision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that where she is right now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s a special cot.&rdquo; She took a breath and made sure to maintain eye contact. &ldquo;This cot helps keep her body cool. Right now, she still looks very much like a healthy newborn. She&rsquo;s a bit smaller, being 34 weeks gestation, and her lips and fingernails are a bit darker than normal. This was&hellip; she passed 6 or so hours ago, so there&rsquo;s no injuries to her skin. For the most part, she&rsquo;ll just look like she&rsquo;s sleeping.&rdquo;</p><p>John&rsquo;s breath hitched as he tried to nod his head in understanding.</p><p>&ldquo;Can - can I hold her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Take as much or as little time as you want. She&rsquo;s wrapped in a blanket from the nursery but you can dress her, if you&rsquo;d like, maybe an outfit you brought from home or something from the nursery?&rdquo;</p><p>John thought of the small gift bags he&rsquo;d hidden in the boot of his car last week. A surprise for Alex. He couldn&rsquo;t bring it in with him earlier without ruining the surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; his voice cracked, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s uh- it&rsquo;s in the car park. Should I get it now? Do I have time?&rdquo;</p><p>Doctor Parks nodded her head. &ldquo;As soon as we&rsquo;re done here.&rdquo; She steeled herself. &ldquo;Last thing, if you&rsquo;d like, the maternity care specialist can come in and help you take an imprint of her hands or feet. And if you&rsquo;re so inclined, the photographer can come and take her portrait for you.&rdquo;</p><p>John sat back in his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Any or all or none. It&rsquo;s up to you. If you&rsquo;re more comfortable doing it, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to take pictures on your phone yourself. I know it may seem odd, but many parents find comfort having these mementos later on. You think about it. Take your time, doesn&rsquo;t matter how long. You set the pace here John.&rdquo;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He raked his hands down his face and leaned his elbows on his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry. I can&rsquo;t imagine how difficult this is. If there&rsquo;s anything I can do or if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.&rdquo;</p><p>He slowly lifted his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Alex and Olivia.&rdquo; He stood and took a step toward the door. &ldquo;I mean, unless they want to&hellip; but don&rsquo;t tell them I have. I don&rsquo;t want them to hurt any more. They can do what they like, but I need to do this.&rdquo; He took a deep breath and wiped his nose on his sleeve. &ldquo;I need to get something out of my car. I&rsquo;ll be quick.&rdquo;</p><p>Doctor Parks stood as well, picking up the folder and moving to open the door for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Would you like me to walk down to the exit with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no. Just&hellip; Where do I&hellip; Where is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come back up to the nurses station. I&rsquo;ll take you from there.&rdquo; She opened the door and handed the folder to John. &ldquo;Take these with you. There&rsquo;s more in there for Ms. Jones for when she goes home. I&rsquo;ll give her her own copies when she&rsquo;s discharged as well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. Be right back.&rdquo;</p></p>",
