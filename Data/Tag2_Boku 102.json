        "body": "<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nEndeavor died! But it\u2019s okay because then he got better! In the meantime, the\nHigh Definition Noumu managed to destroy a whole lot of the\ncity, to the point where it reminded a lot of people of the Kamino attack\nthree months prior. There was a lot of meta about why Endeavor couldn\u2019t quit.\nPart of it is because the world still needs a Symbol, and he\u2019s what they\u2019ve got\nright now. But as Hawks and Fuyumi also observed, Endeavor is also just really\nbad at giving up. As Hawks observed, back during All Might\u2019s heyday,\nEndeavor was the only one who even attempted to try and surpass him, despite knowing he had no chance. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of bullheaded tenacity that allowed\nthis crazy fire man to force himself back up, use his flames to propel himself,\nand chase after the Noumu while the world (and his son, who\u2019s watching in the\nU.A. common room with his classmates and Aizawa) looked on. Then Hawks finally\nshowed up to help out, and lent Endeavor some of his feathers to aid him in his\nspeed and movement. And with that little boost, Endeavor launched one final\nflaming fist attack. Hopefully it\u2019ll be enough.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor punches the High Flying Noumu with his flame fist and tries to burn it from the inside out. Somehow it still doesn\u2019t work. Everyone watching is like\u00a0\u201cAHHH\u201d and Shouto is like\u00a0\u201cDAD D:\u201d and Hawks is like\u00a0\u201cdude you burned all my feathers, I can\u2019t help you out anymore.\u201d But Endeavor is all \u201cit\u2019s okay we good\u201d and he grabs the Noumu and blasts way up into the sky where he can unleash his full power without having to worry about hurting anyone in the vicinity. And then he unleashes another Prominence Burn attack, but this time with Plus Ultra. Everyone is like\u00a0\u201choly shit\u201d and it\u2019s fucking tense as hell, and then a moment later Endeavor comes plummeting down from the sky still on fire and goes splat on some random car. And then he stands up and does the All Might victory pose. Goddamn. So everyone is all\u00a0\u201cYESSSSS\u201d, and Hawks goes to help him because he\u2019s still barely fucking conscious, and for just a moment it looks like everything\u2019s going to be all right. And then Dabi shows up. And is all\u00a0\u201chey there Endeavor. it sure is nice to quote-unquote\u00a0\u2018meet\u2019 you, lol.\u201d Oh fucking snap.</p><p><br/></p><p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

In the meantime, the\nHigh Definition Noumu managed to destroy a whole lot of the\ncity, to the point where it reminded a lot of people of the Kamino attack\nthree months prior. There was a lot of meta about why Endeavor couldn\u2019t quit.\nPart of it is because the world still needs a Symbol, and he\u2019s what they\u2019ve got\nright now. But as Hawks and Fuyumi also observed, Endeavor is also just really\nbad at giving up. As Hawks observed, back during All Might\u2019s heyday,\nEndeavor was the only one who even attempted to try and surpass him, despite knowing he had no chance. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of bullheaded tenacity that allowed\nthis crazy fire man to force himself back up, use his flames to propel himself,\nand chase after the Noumu while the world (and his son, who\u2019s watching in the\nU.A. common room with his classmates and Aizawa) looked on. Then Hawks finally\nshowed up to help out, and lent Endeavor some of his feathers to aid him in his\nspeed and movement. And with that little boost, Endeavor launched one final\nflaming fist attack. Hopefully it\u2019ll be enough.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor punches the High Flying Noumu with his flame fist and tries to burn it from the inside out. Somehow it still doesn\u2019t work. Everyone watching is like\u00a0\u201cAHHH\u201d and Shouto is like\u00a0\u201cDAD D:\u201d and Hawks is like\u00a0\u201cdude you burned all my feathers, I can\u2019t help you out anymore.\u201d But Endeavor is all \u201cit\u2019s okay we good\u201d and he grabs the Noumu and blasts way up into the sky where he can unleash his full power without having to worry about hurting anyone in the vicinity. And then he unleashes another Prominence Burn attack, but this time with Plus Ultra.

                "content": "<p><p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nEndeavor died! But it&rsquo;s okay because then he got better! In the meantime, the\nHigh Definition Noumu managed to destroy a whole lot of the\ncity, to the point where it reminded a lot of people of the Kamino attack\nthree months prior. There was a lot of meta about why Endeavor couldn&rsquo;t quit.\nPart of it is because the world still needs a Symbol, and he&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve got\nright now. But as Hawks and Fuyumi also observed, Endeavor is also just really\nbad at giving up. As Hawks observed, back during All Might&rsquo;s heyday,\nEndeavor was the only one who even attempted to try and surpass him, despite knowing he had no chance. And that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of bullheaded tenacity that allowed\nthis crazy fire man to force himself back up, use his flames to propel himself,\nand chase after the Noumu while the world (and his son, who&rsquo;s watching in the\nU.A. common room with his classmates and Aizawa) looked on. Then Hawks finally\nshowed up to help out, and lent Endeavor some of his feathers to aid him in his\nspeed and movement. And with that little boost, Endeavor launched one final\nflaming fist attack. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be enough.</p><p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor punches the High Flying Noumu with his flame fist and tries to burn it from the inside out. Somehow it still doesn&rsquo;t work. Everyone watching is like&nbsp;&ldquo;AHHH&rdquo; and Shouto is like&nbsp;&ldquo;DAD D:&rdquo; and Hawks is like&nbsp;&ldquo;dude you burned all my feathers, I can&rsquo;t help you out anymore.&rdquo; But Endeavor is all &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay we good&rdquo; and he grabs the Noumu and blasts way up into the sky where he can unleash his full power without having to worry about hurting anyone in the vicinity. And then he unleashes another Prominence Burn attack, but this time with Plus Ultra. Everyone is like&nbsp;&ldquo;holy shit&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s fucking tense as hell, and then a moment later Endeavor comes plummeting down from the sky still on fire and goes splat on some random car. And then he stands up and does the All Might victory pose. Goddamn. So everyone is all&nbsp;&ldquo;YESSSSS&rdquo;, and Hawks goes to help him because he&rsquo;s still barely fucking conscious, and for just a moment it looks like everything&rsquo;s going to be all right.

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n\n<p><b>Previously on BnHA:</b>\nEndeavor died! But it&rsquo;s okay because then he got better! In the meantime, the\nHigh Definition Noumu managed to destroy a whole lot of the\ncity, to the point where it reminded a lot of people of the Kamino attack\nthree months prior. There was a lot of meta about why Endeavor couldn&rsquo;t quit.\nPart of it is because the world still needs a Symbol, and he&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve got\nright now. But as Hawks and Fuyumi also observed, Endeavor is also just really\nbad at giving up. As Hawks observed, back during All Might&rsquo;s heyday,\nEndeavor was the only one who even attempted to try and surpass him, despite knowing he had no chance. And that&rsquo;s exactly the kind of bullheaded tenacity that allowed\nthis crazy fire man to force himself back up, use his flames to propel himself,\nand chase after the Noumu while the world (and his son, who&rsquo;s watching in the\nU.A. common room with his classmates and Aizawa) looked on. Then Hawks finally\nshowed up to help out, and lent Endeavor some of his feathers to aid him in his\nspeed and movement. And with that little boost, Endeavor launched one final\nflaming fist attack. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll be enough.</p>\n<p><b>Today on BnHA:</b> Endeavor punches the High Flying Noumu with his flame fist and tries to burn it from the inside out. Somehow it still doesn&rsquo;t work. Everyone watching is like&nbsp;&ldquo;AHHH&rdquo; and Shouto is like&nbsp;&ldquo;DAD D:&rdquo; and Hawks is like&nbsp;&ldquo;dude you burned all my feathers, I can&rsquo;t help you out anymore.&rdquo; But Endeavor is all &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay we good&rdquo; and he grabs the Noumu and blasts way up into the sky where he can unleash his full power without having to worry about hurting anyone in the vicinity. And then he unleashes another Prominence Burn attack, but this time with Plus Ultra. Everyone is like&nbsp;&ldquo;holy shit&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s fucking tense as hell, and then a moment later Endeavor comes plummeting down from the sky still on fire and goes splat on some random car. And then he stands up and does the All Might victory pose. Goddamn. So everyone is all&nbsp;&ldquo;YESSSSS&rdquo;, and Hawks goes to help him because he&rsquo;s still barely fucking conscious, and for just a moment it looks like everything&rsquo;s going to be all right. And then Dabi shows up. And is all&nbsp;&ldquo;hey there Endeavor. it sure is nice to quote-unquote&nbsp;&lsquo;meet&rsquo; you, lol.&rdquo; Oh fucking snap.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>(As always, all comments not marked with an ETA are my unspoiled reactions from my first readthrough of this chapter.

I\u2019m super happy to have been able to work with the amazing people behind it and thoroughly hope you all can enjoy the content if you bought it - their blog will also post every completed piece, so make sure to check that out! \u2665</i></p><p><i>Word Count: 5.125</i></p><hr><p>With a cigarette almost completely out hanging loosely between the edges\nof his beak, Fumikage Tokoyami looked around the empty street before tossing\nthe cigarette onto the ground and stomping it out. He gently blew the smoke out\nof his lungs, tracing small images into the night air. He studied them\nabsently, letting his expression soften with a smile.</p><p>It had been a calm night overall among the citizens that passed by the\narea he was in. Although he was surprised with how things had gone so smoothly,\nhe also wished there would\u2019ve been more bustle in the city \u2013 he hadn\u2019t made\nmore than \u00a56.550, and even if he knew better than to complain about what he\ncould earn, he couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed with how the night turned\nout. Still, it was well past 1am and he wanted to go back home as soon as he\ncould, so he lit another cigarette and took a big puff. <i>For the long road ahead</i>, he told himself as the bitter taste of\ncinder reclaimed its place on his tongue.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to be all over the place on the way back as he\nwalked slowly, the soft breeze sending a shiver down his spine as he gripped\nthe handles of his guitar case a bit tighter - Fumikage was never a nostalgic\nperson per se, but anyone with a mind-reading Quirk nearby might think\notherwise. It was one of those nights where he\u2019d end up doubting himself and\nhis goals throughout the hours, the various memories coming back to him not\nhelping at all with his sentimentality. He only hoped he could get some sleep\nalong the way, and he looked up at the night sky for a moment only to see a few\ndots scattered all across the dark canvas above. The brightest stars seemed to\ntwinkle as if saying hello, and he realized how much he missed being able to\nsee more of them, of their beauty.</p><p>A memory popped up in his head then, a simple image of him gazing at a\nbeautiful starry sky while sitting on the roof of his house a few years back.\nThe sheer contrast of the white and red dots against the deep blue sky always\nused to leave him in awe of the world around him, and sometimes he brought his\nguitar along to sing a ballad to the moon in hopes of making the feeling of\nsolitude go away, something not even the entity inside of him could achieve. He\nremembered when he was younger and his father used to come along, too, the\neverlasting support for his son making the young man\u2019s heart swell with joy.</p><p>It had also been in that same rooftop that he had had the pleasure of\nlistening to what would quickly become his favourite album of all time,\nJourney\u2019s Escape \u2013 it ignited the spark needed to fuel his passion for music,\nsomething that had existed ever since he was a toddler but that had never been\ntruly cemented into him. It was no surprise for anyone when he had claimed he\nwanted to apply to Yuuei, Japan\u2019s most prestigious performing arts conservatory\nknown to train the best musicians in the country.</p><p>Tokoyami hopped on the last bus of the night and threw away his half\nsmoked cigarette while remembering that on that same rooftop, too, had been\nwhen he first doubted himself years later; if he was doing the right thing, if\nit was all just for a whim, or if playing music for a living was truly the end\nof the road for him and his ambitions. He wanted to know more about the world\nand there was so much more to learn, and he didn\u2019t want to feel like he was\njust another wasted talent. Those doubts led him to drop the future Yuuei had\noffered him once he graduated, instead turning to the streets as a source of\nliving while playing whatever music he wanted on his beloved instrument.</p><p>He felt a small rustling beside him along with the sensation of\nsomething <i>leaving</i> his own being, a\nsign that he was no longer the only one in that bus besides the driver -\nsometimes he did hate having a sentient Quirk. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re having a\nhard time,\u201d said Dark Shadow from beside him, but it didn\u2019t faze Fumikage in\nthe slightest. The bright light of the vehicle kept it controlled, and for that\nhe was immensely thankful. \u201cYou can talk to me, you know? I can sense when\nyou\u2019re not okay, and your thoughts are yelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in,\u201d was the only reply that left him as he put his forehead\nto the window glass, the cold material doing little to help his tiredness.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not needed now. I am only\u2026\u201d but the words escaped him before he could\nexplain anything, maybe because he himself wasn\u2019t entirely sure of what was\ngoing on through his mind; the images fumbled together and a small headache was\nstarting to appear. \u201cI am only thinking.\u201d And with that, he was left alone\nagain as Dark Shadow retreated, a dejected look on its face.</p><p>Whenever his insecurities appeared there was always Dark Shadow to help,\nand the two had been good friends ever since his Quirk first manifested.\nDespite being hard to manage when in dark places, Tokoyami made sure to always\nhave at least a source of light on him, be it a small flashlight that he kept\nwell hidden in his backpack or playing in a particularly well-lit spot. He knew\nit would only be a matter of time until something bad happened so he always\ntried to stay out of danger\u2019s way, preventing as much of it as possible. The\nentity acted as his main source of support ever since he had left his family\u2019s\nhouse and while there were a lot of things he\u2019d change about it, he felt\ngreatly thankful to have it in his life \u2013 it being a part of him meant having\nlittle to no secrets, and sometimes it made it easier to let go of the\nemotional load he tended to keep to himself.</p><p>Sighing and fogging the glass a bit, Fumikage replayed the events of\nthat night silently, picking the different moments he found to be the most\nfulfilling. If there was something interesting about being a street musician he\nwould\u2019ve named the tons of people he got to see every day, imagining their\nstories and talking to them to find out if he had been right about something.\nIt had become a little game only for himself, but ever since he started his new\n<i>profession</i> there had been two\nspecific people that stood out to him the most. He liked thinking about them,\nas they had showed him different sides to something he had always considered to\nbe very black and white.</p><!-- more --><p>The first one he met almost by chance, the memory replaying as an\noverused tape - it had been one of his busiest days and the only time to rest\nfor no more than fifteen minutes came around at dusk time, when he noticed that\npeople were already scattering towards their destinations without really paying\nattention to their surroundings. With his body feeling as tired as it could be,\nhe walked to his preferred resting spot, an old alley that kept him hidden from\nthe judgemental looks he got sometimes. A sturdy box had been placed against a\nwall God knows how long ago, and he had taken a liking to sitting there with\nhis guitar, tuning it or just playing whatever came to his mind as he let the\nstress go. It had been no different that day, just a regular afternoon, until\nhe heard voices coming from the entrance of the alley.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d one of the voices, a high-pitched, unmistakably\ngirly voice said with a hint of amazement in her tone. Without even tearing his\ngaze away from the instrument on his hands he felt as Dark Shadow came out, but\nFumikage felt too focused to even ask him to return. The people outside didn\u2019t\nseem to notice at all, and he had to thank the dim lighting of the narrow space\nfor that. \u201cHe seems like he has such a good Quirk too; he\u2019s probably talented\nwith it too.\u201d</p><p>Dark Shadow\u2019s low laugh resonated all the way to his body, and with a\nlow growl the young man wordlessly signalled that he wouldn\u2019t be in the mood to\nget interrupted any time soon. It had been a long day and social interaction\nwasn\u2019t exactly on his to-do list at the moment - it was his moment to be alone,\nhis mind needing the space to be able to function properly until the late\nnight. \u201cYou should give them a chance,\u201d the entity said before retreating into\nhim, \u201cthey look nice enough to have a chat with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOchaco-chan, why don\u2019t you just go talk to him?\u201d The girl that replied\nhad a slightly lower, more concerned tone as she whispered some more stuff he\ncouldn\u2019t have been bothered enough to eavesdrop in. But soon he heard\napproaching footsteps, and he closed his eyes in a futile attempt to camouflage\nhimself with the wall behind. \u201cExcuse me, I know that you must be resting, but\nmy friend and I wanted to congratulate you for the amazing performance.\u201d\nLooking up and opening his eyes he was met with the sight of two big eyes\nframed by two strands of green hair, staring at him as if trying to pierce\nright through his soul. She was alone, and he wondered if she had been the\nbraver one out of the two or if she had left her friend behind for another\nreason.</p><p>Once his eyes got used to what little light there was and he got a\nbetter look of her he recognized her as one of two girls who had been enjoying\nhis show for a long while and dancing along to some of his repertoire before he\ntook a break, and when he looked to the side he saw the friend that was with\nher talking on the phone before sending them a curious glance. The two of them\nformed a weird pair he thought, but by the way they acted with one another was\na sign of how strong their friendship was. Her features and gestures reminded\nhim to those of a frog, and he wondered if it had anything to do with her\nQuirk. \u201cI\u2019m truly glad you enjoyed the show,\u201d he replied shortly while putting\nhis guitar back on its case on the floor, unsure of whether they\u2019d hang around\nmore or if that\u2019d be the last time he\u2019d see them.</p><p>With a warm smile, the girl kneeled beside him and pulled her white\ncardigan a bit more over her chest, the breeze running along the streets\nalready getting colder with each passing second. He noticed she looked smaller\nbeneath the item of clothing. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the few people I\u2019ve met in my life\nthat I can tell has true passion for playing an instrument,\u201d she added without\na hint of hesitation. \u201cI wish I could play like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you play guitar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransverse flute and violin, actually - been playing since I was 8.\u201d\nSilence fell over them and Fumikage felt almost scared of breaking it, and\ninstead leaned against the wall behind - in moments like this he really wanted\nto be the kind of person that could keep alive a conversation without much\neffort, cursing his bad luck when it came to interacting with other people. She\ndidn\u2019t seem like she wanted to be a bother, but he did wonder the reason why\nshe had decided to casually spend some time with a simple street artist like\nhim. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not being a nuisance right now; you\u2019re awfully quiet.\u201d</p><p>Slightly taken aback by her words, he sighed and turned his attention\nback to her as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2026 enjoy having someone to talk to about\nthis sort of thing. Although I must admit I do feel undeserving of such nice\ncomments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndeserving? No way!\u201d she retorted, and it was only then that he\nrealized that he was opening up with someone he didn\u2019t even know the name of.\n\u201cI truly wish I could play like you. I was partly forced to learn so I never\nreally knew what playing for a passion was.\u201d His expression turned into one of\nunderstanding as he heard those words, and he smiled down at her with newfound\nempathy. Her own smile had faded, leaving behind a sad appearance. \u201cIt was all\nmy parents\u2019 doing as a means to encourage me I guess - I don\u2019t blame them\nfully, but I sometimes wonder if it would\u2019ve been different had I learnt\nbecause I wanted to. I could\u2019ve never dedicated my life to music like you do,\nhowever, but I like meeting people like you.\u201d</p><p>The way she spoke about her own experience brought back his doubts and\nhe was ready to tell her about that, but then another voice was heard from the\nalley entrance, making them both turn around. Her friend was calling out to her\n- <i>Tsuyu</i> with two cups of what seemed\nto be boba tea on her hands. With what sounded like a way too hopeful voice for\nhim, he quickly said, \u201cWill you two stick around for a bit longer? I\u2019m about to\ngo back out; if you\u2019d like to, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go, but I\u2019ll make sure to come back to watch you play again\nsomeday.\u201d</p><p>It was only then he realized he had never given her his name.</p><p>And as they said their goodbyes she got up and walked away, and the\nmemory came to an abrupt halt as the bus Fumikage was riding stopped so hard in\nfront of a red light it almost made him hit his head on the window and fall off\nhis seat. Mumbling incoherent curses as he sent a death glare toward the driver\nand wishing Dark Shadow would <i>not </i>come\nout to tease him about it he sunk back down on the comfortable leather, letting\nhis mind fly back to his trail of thoughts after checking he still had some\ntime to kill before reaching his stop looking through the window glass.</p><p>The second most interesting person he met wasn\u2019t someone who had come by\nto one of his performances - instead, he had been the one to meet <i>him</i>, almost on purpose.</p><p>It had been a late night of the last autumn, one that had had just the\nmost delightful weather and that seemed to be made specifically for everyone to\nenjoy. Armed with his beloved black jacket and a cigarette in his beak, he\nwalked downtown to his favourite bar, hoping to have a nice time while getting\naway from everything else in the world and its tendency to always make him feel\nunder pressure. He didn\u2019t expect the loud music coming from the inside as soon\nas he crossed the main doors of the place, or the way people were looking at\nthe band playing like they were the most amazing thing they had ever heard. <i>Just noise to the ears</i>, he thought as he\noccupied his usual place at a table close to the bar, <i>they all sound monotonous</i>.</p><p>However, as he listened more and more and downed a bottle of beer, even\na harsh sceptic like himself could find himself bobbing his head to the hard\nrock being played on the little stage. Fumikage analysed the four people (three\nboys and a girl) that were playing as if trying to discover a hidden secret,\nbut all he saw was four people just having fun\u2026 or three, to be honest. One of\nthem had an angry expression on his scarred face, a sour testament that\nwhatever was going through his mind wasn\u2019t the prettiest of thoughts; the bass\nhe played seemed to be in pretty bad shape, and he wondered how the guy could\neven play an instrument like that. His red and white hair stuck to his face\nthanks to the sweat running down his cheeks, and he looked rather threatening.</p><p>It took them another two songs before they finally said their goodbyes\nand walked off the stage to the sound of vigorous clapping, and by that point\nhe felt way too curious about them to just let them walk away. He carefully\nwatched as they high-fived each other, all smiling and seeming happy with their\nperformance, even the two-colour haired guy. He was the one that went to the\nbar, ordering drinks for him and all his friends, and that\u2019s when Fumikage\ndecided to take the chance to speak up. \u201cNice work,\u201d he said loud enough to be\nheard, and the stranger only sent him a side glance. \u201cIt is always a pleasure\nto see someone channel their feelings through music like you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a critic or something?\u201d the male replied and Fumikage only shook\nhis head, the bartender being told by the man to take the order to his\nbandmates after receiving the money for everything. When he was free again, he\napproached Tokoyami\u2019s table and plopped down on the chair in front of his and\nlet out a long sigh. \u201cI wish we received more comments like yours - it always\nseems like we play for no one in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone here seemed to be enjoying it greatly,\u201d Fumikage added without\nmuch spirit and already feeling a bit dizzy; the beer was starting to work its\nmagic on him, and he internally cursed at himself for not having something with\nalcohol in his system for the longest time. Closing his eyes and taking a deep\nbreath, he introduced himself before asking for one in return</p><p>Heterochromatic eyes posed on him and seemed to look at him up and down\nbefore reaching a verdict about whether or not he was trustworthy - he hoped he\nlooked the part. \u201cTodoroki,\u201d the stranger said as he reached out and offered\nhis hand above the table, careful about the bottles. Fumikage took it and gave\nit a little shake before turning around and asking for another beer. \u201cI\u2019m\nreally glad you enjoyed the show.\u201d</p><p>The name rung a distant bell in Tokoyami\u2019s mind but he ignored it,\ninstead choosing to talk about the band and its origins as Todoroki\u2019s drink was\nbrought to him. He was told that the others\u2019 names were Bakugou, Jirou and\nKaminari and that the four were high school friends that had the same goal in\nmind: creating meaningful music that could reach to the world and bring people\ntogether. It was beautiful, barely poetic, but there was still a long way to go\nand they knew it. \u201cAnd did you always play bass or did you start with guitar?\u201d</p><p>What he thought was an innocent question suddenly made Todoroki\u2019s body\ntense, his left hand gripping his own beer bottle just a bit tighter. \u201cI\nstarted with piano actually - my old man\u2026 he wanted me to play. Forced me,\nactually. He\u2019d given me a really strict teacher and would embarrass me if I\never got things wrong. You can say I started playing as some sort of revenge\ntowards him, but honestly I don\u2019t care anymore. I left my home about four years\nago when I was 16 for personal reasons and I have no plans of coming back any\ntime soon.\u201d The emotional turn of the conversation made Fumikage think he\u2019d\ncommitted a mistake by asking, but seeing how naturally Todoroki had opened up\nto him, someone he had just met, made him think that he wasn\u2019t entirely to\nblame for it. \u201cSorry for that,\u201d Todoroki added with a small smile tugging at\nthe corners of his lips, \u201cShouldn\u2019t have unleashed all of that on you when\nwe\u2019ve barely talked at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing more about people,\u201d was the simple response to that,\nFumikage\u2019s curious expression turning into a relaxed one with a smile of his\nown, \u201cAnd you look like you could use an ear to let out some steam; don\u2019t\nworry, I\u2019ll be like the deepest tomb and keep everything within me.\u201d</p><p>And like that, he felt as if he had gained a new friend as the two\ntalked for a few more minutes about their love for music (Journey had,\ncoincidentally, been the first rock band Todoroki had liked as well, although\nit was their latest record that had amazed him), the band\u2019s next shows and how\nmuch the bassist was looking forward to the recording of their first album.\nTime passed and they were both just drunk enough to laugh at anything, and in\nbetween giggles and snorts they didn\u2019t hear an ash-blond man approaching or\nshouting at Todoroki until he was close enough to tap his shoulder. When the\ntwo looked up, Fumikage recognized him as the drummer of the band.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me you\u2019re getting drunk without us?\u201d He said with a growl,\nbut Fumikage could tell there was no ill intent behind his words - only\ntiredness. \u201cNo more tomfoolery then, we\u2019re going and if you take longer than\nfive fucking seconds to get out we\u2019re leaving without you.\u201d Despite the harsh\ntone and the deep frown, his lips were curved up in a smile, and he left\nwithout speaking another word. His pose denoted confidence, maybe more than a\nguy should ever have.</p><p>With a sigh, Todoroki left his third beer bottle on the table and\noffered his new acquaintance a gentle smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Bakugou can\nget quite\u2026 heavy sometimes. They actually left without me in two occasions, it\nwasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d He let out a short laugh, and above the talking and noises\naround them, Fumikage could hear a note of nervousness in his voice. \u201cHopefully\nwe\u2019ll see you again the next time.\u201d They both nodded in agreement and without\nmuch more left to be said Todoroki got up and left, leaving behind a trail of\nsomething akin to happiness.</p><p>The rest of the night was all but a blur for Tokoyami, and soon he was\nback on the bus on the present, the memory now returning to the back of his\nmind as if trying to hide itself from being seen again. He tried to think if\nthere was something escaping his mind amidst the events he remembered as he\npulled his jacket a bit more over his body, the cold of the night now reaching\nevery part of him and making a chill run down his spine. He looked out the\nwindow and noticed that it was almost time for him to get off, only a few more\nstops until he reached his destination.</p><p>But before he could do anything more someone tapped his shoulder,\nprompting him to turn around almost defensively. A green haired boy with big\nmatching eyes returned his surprised gaze with a smile proper of those who had\nno malice inside. He wondered when he had gotten on the bus and why he hadn\u2019t\nheard him. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to have startled you!\u201d Even his voice was kind, and\nFumikage could only nod his head before starting to get out of his seat. \u201cI had\nthis feeling in my mind and just wanted to make sure I remembered you correctly\n- you went to Yuuei as well, right?\u201d The statement almost made Fumikage stop on\nhis tracks but he soon recovered and nodded once more, not really wanting to\nadd more to that. \u201cI knew it; my name is Izuku Midoriya, I was in the same year\nbut in a different class! I don\u2019t expect you to remember but it\u2019s surprising to\nfind you here.\u201d</p><p>If the name rung a bell in his mind he greatly ignored it, bent on\nforgetting most of his experience back at the school. \u201cI live close-by,\u201d he\nsaid, getting up while grabbing his guitar and now feeling slightly annoyed\nthat his past had somehow found the way to bite his back once again. \u201cExcuse me\nbut I must make this a short chat, this where I get off,\u201d He added as he\nclumsily made his way to the rear door and pressed the button to let the driver\nknow he had to stop. Curiosity got the better of him as he saw Midoriya\nfollowing his actions, and he started to think that he had encountered a\npossible stalker.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is my stop too,\u201d Izuku replied, \u201cmy mom moved to this\npart of the city last year and I\u2019m visiting her.\u201d Silence fell upon them as\nthey reached their destination, but before they could go their separate ways\nIzuku spoke up, the breeze lightly playing with his green locks. \u201cSo, what model\ndo you play?\u201d The question took Fumikage by surprise, and he replied as he\nopened his bag to get a cigarette and the lighter - he had wanted to leave but\nfor some reason he didn\u2019t want to go home just yet. It was the same feeling he\nhad whenever he met someone through his performances, and his gut was never\nwrong when it came to interesting people. They both leaned against a nearby\nwall and he asked Izuku if he played guitar as well, but the other guy shook\nhis head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d love to start. I just need to find time between\npractices - I already play three other instruments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would those be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiano, koto and end-blown flute! The first and last I perfected back at\nthe academy but I\u2019ve played koto ever since I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoto?\u201d Fumikage felt his\neyes widen at the sole mention of the traditional Japanese instrument, as he\nhad never met anyone his age that could even distinguish it from other stringed\ninstruments. His gaze fixated on the other\u2019s, he felt the need to know more\nabout him growing significantly. \u201cWhy did you choose that one?\u201d</p><p>Midoriya smiled and\nlooked at the ground beneath his feet, seemingly deep in thought. He took his\ntime to reply and for a moment Fumikage felt he had hit a sensitive cord within\nhim. \u201cMaybe because\u2026\u201d he started slowly, and Fumikage could tell he was trying\nto pick his words very carefully. \u201cMaybe it was because it can be a happy\ninstrument too. I can\u2019t explain the joy I get when it\u2019s on my hands, and it\u2019s\nvery easy to convey my own feelings through it. In that sense it\u2019s very similar\nto a guitar, and as long as I can showcase how I\u2019m feeling with it, I\u2019m okay. I\njust want to create music that\u2019s able to reach people\u2019s hearts and make them\nhappy as well.\u201d</p><p>Fumikage listened\ncarefully and witnessed as Izuku\u2019s expression went from soft and tired to\ncontent in a matter of seconds, and he was impressed to see the effect that\nmusic had on the stranger he couldn\u2019t even remember. Doubts swarmed his mind\nonce more and even if he tried his best to dissipate them he couldn\u2019t, choosing\ninstead to sigh and take a short puff from his cigarette as it would be easier\nthan let his mind wander - the smoke tasted more bitter now and his lips curved\ninto a disgusted gesture, but he still said nothing for another few seconds.\n\u201cYou are very passionate, I see. I am always glad to meet lovers of music, but\nyou might exceed everyone else I have met so far.\u201d Had he ever played for true\nhappiness? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>The words left his lips\nmindlessly, as if he was talking to himself rather than to someone else, yet it\nfelt almost like talking to a known friend. He felt comfortable, attributing it\nto the things they had in common (which he guessed were more than he knew), and\nhe was pleased he had actually decided to trust the good vibes the guy offered.\nHe threw one more glance at him before taking the cigarette between his right\nindex and thumb fingers and holding it up in front of his eyes, as if the smoke\nwas naught but an inconvenience. He was sure Midoriya couldn\u2019t understand where\nhe was coming from with this, but he certainly didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel the same\nhappiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\nMidoriya-san.\u201d Fumikage was quick to respond as he threw the cigarette to the\nopposite side of the street, watching it let out a few sparks as it hit the\nground. He thought that he\u2019d been doing that a lot that night, much to his\ndislike. \u201cBut I do hope to see you again - I often play nearby the Akihabara\nstation, maybe you can come see me one day.\u201d</p><p>He hoped that the small\nsmile he offered Midoriya was enough indication that he was glad to have had\nthat little talk with him, but he greatly ignored if the other man could even\nsee it; pulling away from the wall, he waved goodbye at him as he grabbed his\nguitar case and started walking fast until he turned around the corner. He\ndidn\u2019t even notice he was holding in a heavy breath until he let it out, long\nand almost making him dizzy.</p><p>As he made his way back\nhome, his heart beat faster too, his own thoughts playing against him - the\nwhole dilemma he felt about whether or not he had taken the right decisions in\nhis life. He froze in place and looked up to the sky, now able to see more\nstars thanks to the now more obvious darkness of the streets. They all seemed\nto hold so many untold secrets and he was partly glad he was only a spectator\nin the big scheme of things.</p><p>He felt himself going\nback to the very first place he started at, one where his uncertainties got the\nbest of him instead of letting him advance and take down the many obstacles he\nencountered. He felt himself going back to those who had impacted him the most,\nand tried his best to attach whatever emotion felt best for each of them - <i>innocence</i> for Tsuyu, <i>rebellion</i> for Todoroki and <i>happiness</i> for Midoriya. Scoffing, he\nremembered there was still so much he could learn from everyone around him, and\nas he pondered the different ways he could implement that newfound knowledge on\nhimself he resumed his walk.</p><p>He felt himself getting\nlost again, but this time he\u2019d make sure to bring himself out of it all to find\nthe spark he had lost along the way.</p>",

He liked thinking about them,\nas they had showed him different sides to something he had always considered to\nbe very black and white.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The first one he met almost by chance, the memory replaying as an\noverused tape - it had been one of his busiest days and the only time to rest\nfor no more than fifteen minutes came around at dusk time, when he noticed that\npeople were already scattering towards their destinations without really paying\nattention to their surroundings. With his body feeling as tired as it could be,\nhe walked to his preferred resting spot, an old alley that kept him hidden from\nthe judgemental looks he got sometimes. A sturdy box had been placed against a\nwall God knows how long ago, and he had taken a liking to sitting there with\nhis guitar, tuning it or just playing whatever came to his mind as he let the\nstress go. It had been no different that day, just a regular afternoon, until\nhe heard voices coming from the entrance of the alley.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d one of the voices, a high-pitched, unmistakably\ngirly voice said with a hint of amazement in her tone. Without even tearing his\ngaze away from the instrument on his hands he felt as Dark Shadow came out, but\nFumikage felt too focused to even ask him to return. The people outside didn\u2019t\nseem to notice at all, and he had to thank the dim lighting of the narrow space\nfor that. \u201cHe seems like he has such a good Quirk too; he\u2019s probably talented\nwith it too.\u201d</p><p>Dark Shadow\u2019s low laugh resonated all the way to his body, and with a\nlow growl the young man wordlessly signalled that he wouldn\u2019t be in the mood to\nget interrupted any time soon. It had been a long day and social interaction\nwasn\u2019t exactly on his to-do list at the moment - it was his moment to be alone,\nhis mind needing the space to be able to function properly until the late\nnight. \u201cYou should give them a chance,\u201d the entity said before retreating into\nhim, \u201cthey look nice enough to have a chat with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOchaco-chan, why don\u2019t you just go talk to him?\u201d The girl that replied\nhad a slightly lower, more concerned tone as she whispered some more stuff he\ncouldn\u2019t have been bothered enough to eavesdrop in. But soon he heard\napproaching footsteps, and he closed his eyes in a futile attempt to camouflage\nhimself with the wall behind. \u201cExcuse me, I know that you must be resting, but\nmy friend and I wanted to congratulate you for the amazing performance.\u201d\nLooking up and opening his eyes he was met with the sight of two big eyes\nframed by two strands of green hair, staring at him as if trying to pierce\nright through his soul. She was alone, and he wondered if she had been the\nbraver one out of the two or if she had left her friend behind for another\nreason.</p><p>Once his eyes got used to what little light there was and he got a\nbetter look of her he recognized her as one of two girls who had been enjoying\nhis show for a long while and dancing along to some of his repertoire before he\ntook a break, and when he looked to the side he saw the friend that was with\nher talking on the phone before sending them a curious glance. The two of them\nformed a weird pair he thought, but by the way they acted with one another was\na sign of how strong their friendship was. Her features and gestures reminded\nhim to those of a frog, and he wondered if it had anything to do with her\nQuirk. \u201cI\u2019m truly glad you enjoyed the show,\u201d he replied shortly while putting\nhis guitar back on its case on the floor, unsure of whether they\u2019d hang around\nmore or if that\u2019d be the last time he\u2019d see them.</p><p>With a warm smile, the girl kneeled beside him and pulled her white\ncardigan a bit more over her chest, the breeze running along the streets\nalready getting colder with each passing second. He noticed she looked smaller\nbeneath the item of clothing. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the few people I\u2019ve met in my life\nthat I can tell has true passion for playing an instrument,\u201d she added without\na hint of hesitation. \u201cI wish I could play like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you play guitar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransverse flute and violin, actually - been playing since I was 8.\u201d\nSilence fell over them and Fumikage felt almost scared of breaking it, and\ninstead leaned against the wall behind - in moments like this he really wanted\nto be the kind of person that could keep alive a conversation without much\neffort, cursing his bad luck when it came to interacting with other people. She\ndidn\u2019t seem like she wanted to be a bother, but he did wonder the reason why\nshe had decided to casually spend some time with a simple street artist like\nhim. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not being a nuisance right now; you\u2019re awfully quiet.\u201d</p><p>Slightly taken aback by her words, he sighed and turned his attention\nback to her as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2026 enjoy having someone to talk to about\nthis sort of thing. Although I must admit I do feel undeserving of such nice\ncomments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndeserving? No way!\u201d she retorted, and it was only then that he\nrealized that he was opening up with someone he didn\u2019t even know the name of.\n\u201cI truly wish I could play like you. I was partly forced to learn so I never\nreally knew what playing for a passion was.\u201d His expression turned into one of\nunderstanding as he heard those words, and he smiled down at her with newfound\nempathy. Her own smile had faded, leaving behind a sad appearance. \u201cIt was all\nmy parents\u2019 doing as a means to encourage me I guess - I don\u2019t blame them\nfully, but I sometimes wonder if it would\u2019ve been different had I learnt\nbecause I wanted to. I could\u2019ve never dedicated my life to music like you do,\nhowever, but I like meeting people like you.\u201d</p><p>The way she spoke about her own experience brought back his doubts and\nhe was ready to tell her about that, but then another voice was heard from the\nalley entrance, making them both turn around. Her friend was calling out to her\n- <i>Tsuyu</i> with two cups of what seemed\nto be boba tea on her hands. With what sounded like a way too hopeful voice for\nhim, he quickly said, \u201cWill you two stick around for a bit longer? I\u2019m about to\ngo back out; if you\u2019d like to, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go, but I\u2019ll make sure to come back to watch you play again\nsomeday.\u201d</p><p>It was only then he realized he had never given her his name.</p><p>And as they said their goodbyes she got up and walked away, and the\nmemory came to an abrupt halt as the bus Fumikage was riding stopped so hard in\nfront of a red light it almost made him hit his head on the window and fall off\nhis seat. Mumbling incoherent curses as he sent a death glare toward the driver\nand wishing Dark Shadow would <i>not </i>come\nout to tease him about it he sunk back down on the comfortable leather, letting\nhis mind fly back to his trail of thoughts after checking he still had some\ntime to kill before reaching his stop looking through the window glass.</p><p>The second most interesting person he met wasn\u2019t someone who had come by\nto one of his performances - instead, he had been the one to meet <i>him</i>, almost on purpose.</p><p>It had been a late night of the last autumn, one that had had just the\nmost delightful weather and that seemed to be made specifically for everyone to\nenjoy. Armed with his beloved black jacket and a cigarette in his beak, he\nwalked downtown to his favourite bar, hoping to have a nice time while getting\naway from everything else in the world and its tendency to always make him feel\nunder pressure. He didn\u2019t expect the loud music coming from the inside as soon\nas he crossed the main doors of the place, or the way people were looking at\nthe band playing like they were the most amazing thing they had ever heard. <i>Just noise to the ears</i>, he thought as he\noccupied his usual place at a table close to the bar, <i>they all sound monotonous</i>.</p><p>However, as he listened more and more and downed a bottle of beer, even\na harsh sceptic like himself could find himself bobbing his head to the hard\nrock being played on the little stage. Fumikage analysed the four people (three\nboys and a girl) that were playing as if trying to discover a hidden secret,\nbut all he saw was four people just having fun\u2026 or three, to be honest. One of\nthem had an angry expression on his scarred face, a sour testament that\nwhatever was going through his mind wasn\u2019t the prettiest of thoughts; the bass\nhe played seemed to be in pretty bad shape, and he wondered how the guy could\neven play an instrument like that. His red and white hair stuck to his face\nthanks to the sweat running down his cheeks, and he looked rather threatening.</p><p>It took them another two songs before they finally said their goodbyes\nand walked off the stage to the sound of vigorous clapping, and by that point\nhe felt way too curious about them to just let them walk away. He carefully\nwatched as they high-fived each other, all smiling and seeming happy with their\nperformance, even the two-colour haired guy. He was the one that went to the\nbar, ordering drinks for him and all his friends, and that\u2019s when Fumikage\ndecided to take the chance to speak up. \u201cNice work,\u201d he said loud enough to be\nheard, and the stranger only sent him a side glance. \u201cIt is always a pleasure\nto see someone channel their feelings through music like you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a critic or something?\u201d the male replied and Fumikage only shook\nhis head, the bartender being told by the man to take the order to his\nbandmates after receiving the money for everything. When he was free again, he\napproached Tokoyami\u2019s table and plopped down on the chair in front of his and\nlet out a long sigh. \u201cI wish we received more comments like yours - it always\nseems like we play for no one in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone here seemed to be enjoying it greatly,\u201d Fumikage added without\nmuch spirit and already feeling a bit dizzy; the beer was starting to work its\nmagic on him, and he internally cursed at himself for not having something with\nalcohol in his system for the longest time. Closing his eyes and taking a deep\nbreath, he introduced himself before asking for one in return</p><p>Heterochromatic eyes posed on him and seemed to look at him up and down\nbefore reaching a verdict about whether or not he was trustworthy - he hoped he\nlooked the part. \u201cTodoroki,\u201d the stranger said as he reached out and offered\nhis hand above the table, careful about the bottles. Fumikage took it and gave\nit a little shake before turning around and asking for another beer. \u201cI\u2019m\nreally glad you enjoyed the show.\u201d</p><p>The name rung a distant bell in Tokoyami\u2019s mind but he ignored it,\ninstead choosing to talk about the band and its origins as Todoroki\u2019s drink was\nbrought to him. He was told that the others\u2019 names were Bakugou, Jirou and\nKaminari and that the four were high school friends that had the same goal in\nmind: creating meaningful music that could reach to the world and bring people\ntogether. It was beautiful, barely poetic, but there was still a long way to go\nand they knew it. \u201cAnd did you always play bass or did you start with guitar?\u201d</p><p>What he thought was an innocent question suddenly made Todoroki\u2019s body\ntense, his left hand gripping his own beer bottle just a bit tighter. \u201cI\nstarted with piano actually - my old man\u2026 he wanted me to play. Forced me,\nactually. He\u2019d given me a really strict teacher and would embarrass me if I\never got things wrong. You can say I started playing as some sort of revenge\ntowards him, but honestly I don\u2019t care anymore. I left my home about four years\nago when I was 16 for personal reasons and I have no plans of coming back any\ntime soon.\u201d The emotional turn of the conversation made Fumikage think he\u2019d\ncommitted a mistake by asking, but seeing how naturally Todoroki had opened up\nto him, someone he had just met, made him think that he wasn\u2019t entirely to\nblame for it. \u201cSorry for that,\u201d Todoroki added with a small smile tugging at\nthe corners of his lips, \u201cShouldn\u2019t have unleashed all of that on you when\nwe\u2019ve barely talked at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing more about people,\u201d was the simple response to that,\nFumikage\u2019s curious expression turning into a relaxed one with a smile of his\nown, \u201cAnd you look like you could use an ear to let out some steam; don\u2019t\nworry, I\u2019ll be like the deepest tomb and keep everything within me.\u201d</p><p>And like that, he felt as if he had gained a new friend as the two\ntalked for a few more minutes about their love for music (Journey had,\ncoincidentally, been the first rock band Todoroki had liked as well, although\nit was their latest record that had amazed him), the band\u2019s next shows and how\nmuch the bassist was looking forward to the recording of their first album.\nTime passed and they were both just drunk enough to laugh at anything, and in\nbetween giggles and snorts they didn\u2019t hear an ash-blond man approaching or\nshouting at Todoroki until he was close enough to tap his shoulder. When the\ntwo looked up, Fumikage recognized him as the drummer of the band.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me you\u2019re getting drunk without us?\u201d He said with a growl,\nbut Fumikage could tell there was no ill intent behind his words - only\ntiredness. \u201cNo more tomfoolery then, we\u2019re going and if you take longer than\nfive fucking seconds to get out we\u2019re leaving without you.\u201d Despite the harsh\ntone and the deep frown, his lips were curved up in a smile, and he left\nwithout speaking another word. His pose denoted confidence, maybe more than a\nguy should ever have.</p><p>With a sigh, Todoroki left his third beer bottle on the table and\noffered his new acquaintance a gentle smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Bakugou can\nget quite\u2026 heavy sometimes. They actually left without me in two occasions, it\nwasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d He let out a short laugh, and above the talking and noises\naround them, Fumikage could hear a note of nervousness in his voice. \u201cHopefully\nwe\u2019ll see you again the next time.\u201d They both nodded in agreement and without\nmuch more left to be said Todoroki got up and left, leaving behind a trail of\nsomething akin to happiness.</p><p>The rest of the night was all but a blur for Tokoyami, and soon he was\nback on the bus on the present, the memory now returning to the back of his\nmind as if trying to hide itself from being seen again. He tried to think if\nthere was something escaping his mind amidst the events he remembered as he\npulled his jacket a bit more over his body, the cold of the night now reaching\nevery part of him and making a chill run down his spine. He looked out the\nwindow and noticed that it was almost time for him to get off, only a few more\nstops until he reached his destination.</p><p>But before he could do anything more someone tapped his shoulder,\nprompting him to turn around almost defensively. A green haired boy with big\nmatching eyes returned his surprised gaze with a smile proper of those who had\nno malice inside. He wondered when he had gotten on the bus and why he hadn\u2019t\nheard him. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to have startled you!\u201d Even his voice was kind, and\nFumikage could only nod his head before starting to get out of his seat. \u201cI had\nthis feeling in my mind and just wanted to make sure I remembered you correctly\n- you went to Yuuei as well, right?\u201d The statement almost made Fumikage stop on\nhis tracks but he soon recovered and nodded once more, not really wanting to\nadd more to that. \u201cI knew it; my name is Izuku Midoriya, I was in the same year\nbut in a different class! I don\u2019t expect you to remember but it\u2019s surprising to\nfind you here.\u201d</p><p>If the name rung a bell in his mind he greatly ignored it, bent on\nforgetting most of his experience back at the school. \u201cI live close-by,\u201d he\nsaid, getting up while grabbing his guitar and now feeling slightly annoyed\nthat his past had somehow found the way to bite his back once again. \u201cExcuse me\nbut I must make this a short chat, this where I get off,\u201d He added as he\nclumsily made his way to the rear door and pressed the button to let the driver\nknow he had to stop. Curiosity got the better of him as he saw Midoriya\nfollowing his actions, and he started to think that he had encountered a\npossible stalker.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is my stop too,\u201d Izuku replied, \u201cmy mom moved to this\npart of the city last year and I\u2019m visiting her.\u201d Silence fell upon them as\nthey reached their destination, but before they could go their separate ways\nIzuku spoke up, the breeze lightly playing with his green locks. \u201cSo, what model\ndo you play?\u201d The question took Fumikage by surprise, and he replied as he\nopened his bag to get a cigarette and the lighter - he had wanted to leave but\nfor some reason he didn\u2019t want to go home just yet. It was the same feeling he\nhad whenever he met someone through his performances, and his gut was never\nwrong when it came to interesting people. They both leaned against a nearby\nwall and he asked Izuku if he played guitar as well, but the other guy shook\nhis head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d love to start. I just need to find time between\npractices - I already play three other instruments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would those be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiano, koto and end-blown flute! The first and last I perfected back at\nthe academy but I\u2019ve played koto ever since I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoto?\u201d Fumikage felt his\neyes widen at the sole mention of the traditional Japanese instrument, as he\nhad never met anyone his age that could even distinguish it from other stringed\ninstruments. His gaze fixated on the other\u2019s, he felt the need to know more\nabout him growing significantly. \u201cWhy did you choose that one?\u201d</p><p>Midoriya smiled and\nlooked at the ground beneath his feet, seemingly deep in thought. He took his\ntime to reply and for a moment Fumikage felt he had hit a sensitive cord within\nhim. \u201cMaybe because\u2026\u201d he started slowly, and Fumikage could tell he was trying\nto pick his words very carefully. \u201cMaybe it was because it can be a happy\ninstrument too. I can\u2019t explain the joy I get when it\u2019s on my hands, and it\u2019s\nvery easy to convey my own feelings through it. In that sense it\u2019s very similar\nto a guitar, and as long as I can showcase how I\u2019m feeling with it, I\u2019m okay. I\njust want to create music that\u2019s able to reach people\u2019s hearts and make them\nhappy as well.\u201d</p><p>Fumikage listened\ncarefully and witnessed as Izuku\u2019s expression went from soft and tired to\ncontent in a matter of seconds, and he was impressed to see the effect that\nmusic had on the stranger he couldn\u2019t even remember. Doubts swarmed his mind\nonce more and even if he tried his best to dissipate them he couldn\u2019t, choosing\ninstead to sigh and take a short puff from his cigarette as it would be easier\nthan let his mind wander - the smoke tasted more bitter now and his lips curved\ninto a disgusted gesture, but he still said nothing for another few seconds.\n\u201cYou are very passionate, I see. I am always glad to meet lovers of music, but\nyou might exceed everyone else I have met so far.\u201d Had he ever played for true\nhappiness? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>The words left his lips\nmindlessly, as if he was talking to himself rather than to someone else, yet it\nfelt almost like talking to a known friend. He felt comfortable, attributing it\nto the things they had in common (which he guessed were more than he knew), and\nhe was pleased he had actually decided to trust the good vibes the guy offered.\nHe threw one more glance at him before taking the cigarette between his right\nindex and thumb fingers and holding it up in front of his eyes, as if the smoke\nwas naught but an inconvenience. He was sure Midoriya couldn\u2019t understand where\nhe was coming from with this, but he certainly didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel the same\nhappiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\nMidoriya-san.\u201d Fumikage was quick to respond as he threw the cigarette to the\nopposite side of the street, watching it let out a few sparks as it hit the\nground. He thought that he\u2019d been doing that a lot that night, much to his\ndislike. \u201cBut I do hope to see you again - I often play nearby the Akihabara\nstation, maybe you can come see me one day.\u201d</p><p>He hoped that the small\nsmile he offered Midoriya was enough indication that he was glad to have had\nthat little talk with him, but he greatly ignored if the other man could even\nsee it; pulling away from the wall, he waved goodbye at him as he grabbed his\nguitar case and started walking fast until he turned around the corner. He\ndidn\u2019t even notice he was holding in a heavy breath until he let it out, long\nand almost making him dizzy.</p><p>As he made his way back\nhome, his heart beat faster too, his own thoughts playing against him - the\nwhole dilemma he felt about whether or not he had taken the right decisions in\nhis life. He froze in place and looked up to the sky, now able to see more\nstars thanks to the now more obvious darkness of the streets. They all seemed\nto hold so many untold secrets and he was partly glad he was only a spectator\nin the big scheme of things.</p><p>He felt himself going\nback to the very first place he started at, one where his uncertainties got the\nbest of him instead of letting him advance and take down the many obstacles he\nencountered. He felt himself going back to those who had impacted him the most,\nand tried his best to attach whatever emotion felt best for each of them - <i>innocence</i> for Tsuyu, <i>rebellion</i> for Todoroki and <i>happiness</i> for Midoriya. Scoffing, he\nremembered there was still so much he could learn from everyone around him, and\nas he pondered the different ways he could implement that newfound knowledge on\nhimself he resumed his walk.</p><p>He felt himself getting\nlost again, but this time he\u2019d make sure to bring himself out of it all to find\nthe spark he had lost along the way.</p>",

I\u2019m super happy to have been able to work with the amazing people behind it and thoroughly hope you all can enjoy the content if you bought it - their blog will also post every completed piece, so make sure to check that out! \u2665</i></p><p><i>Word Count: 5.125</i></p><hr><p>With a cigarette almost completely out hanging loosely between the edges\nof his beak, Fumikage Tokoyami looked around the empty street before tossing\nthe cigarette onto the ground and stomping it out. He gently blew the smoke out\nof his lungs, tracing small images into the night air. He studied them\nabsently, letting his expression soften with a smile.</p><p>It had been a calm night overall among the citizens that passed by the\narea he was in. Although he was surprised with how things had gone so smoothly,\nhe also wished there would\u2019ve been more bustle in the city \u2013 he hadn\u2019t made\nmore than \u00a56.550, and even if he knew better than to complain about what he\ncould earn, he couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed with how the night turned\nout. Still, it was well past 1am and he wanted to go back home as soon as he\ncould, so he lit another cigarette and took a big puff. <i>For the long road ahead</i>, he told himself as the bitter taste of\ncinder reclaimed its place on his tongue.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to be all over the place on the way back as he\nwalked slowly, the soft breeze sending a shiver down his spine as he gripped\nthe handles of his guitar case a bit tighter - Fumikage was never a nostalgic\nperson per se, but anyone with a mind-reading Quirk nearby might think\notherwise. It was one of those nights where he\u2019d end up doubting himself and\nhis goals throughout the hours, the various memories coming back to him not\nhelping at all with his sentimentality. He only hoped he could get some sleep\nalong the way, and he looked up at the night sky for a moment only to see a few\ndots scattered all across the dark canvas above. The brightest stars seemed to\ntwinkle as if saying hello, and he realized how much he missed being able to\nsee more of them, of their beauty.</p><p>A memory popped up in his head then, a simple image of him gazing at a\nbeautiful starry sky while sitting on the roof of his house a few years back.\nThe sheer contrast of the white and red dots against the deep blue sky always\nused to leave him in awe of the world around him, and sometimes he brought his\nguitar along to sing a ballad to the moon in hopes of making the feeling of\nsolitude go away, something not even the entity inside of him could achieve. He\nremembered when he was younger and his father used to come along, too, the\neverlasting support for his son making the young man\u2019s heart swell with joy.</p><p>It had also been in that same rooftop that he had had the pleasure of\nlistening to what would quickly become his favourite album of all time,\nJourney\u2019s Escape \u2013 it ignited the spark needed to fuel his passion for music,\nsomething that had existed ever since he was a toddler but that had never been\ntruly cemented into him. It was no surprise for anyone when he had claimed he\nwanted to apply to Yuuei, Japan\u2019s most prestigious performing arts conservatory\nknown to train the best musicians in the country.</p><p>Tokoyami hopped on the last bus of the night and threw away his half\nsmoked cigarette while remembering that on that same rooftop, too, had been\nwhen he first doubted himself years later; if he was doing the right thing, if\nit was all just for a whim, or if playing music for a living was truly the end\nof the road for him and his ambitions. He wanted to know more about the world\nand there was so much more to learn, and he didn\u2019t want to feel like he was\njust another wasted talent. Those doubts led him to drop the future Yuuei had\noffered him once he graduated, instead turning to the streets as a source of\nliving while playing whatever music he wanted on his beloved instrument.</p><p>He felt a small rustling beside him along with the sensation of\nsomething <i>leaving</i> his own being, a\nsign that he was no longer the only one in that bus besides the driver -\nsometimes he did hate having a sentient Quirk. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re having a\nhard time,\u201d said Dark Shadow from beside him, but it didn\u2019t faze Fumikage in\nthe slightest. The bright light of the vehicle kept it controlled, and for that\nhe was immensely thankful. \u201cYou can talk to me, you know? I can sense when\nyou\u2019re not okay, and your thoughts are yelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in,\u201d was the only reply that left him as he put his forehead\nto the window glass, the cold material doing little to help his tiredness.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not needed now. I am only\u2026\u201d but the words escaped him before he could\nexplain anything, maybe because he himself wasn\u2019t entirely sure of what was\ngoing on through his mind; the images fumbled together and a small headache was\nstarting to appear. \u201cI am only thinking.\u201d And with that, he was left alone\nagain as Dark Shadow retreated, a dejected look on its face.</p><p>Whenever his insecurities appeared there was always Dark Shadow to help,\nand the two had been good friends ever since his Quirk first manifested.\nDespite being hard to manage when in dark places, Tokoyami made sure to always\nhave at least a source of light on him, be it a small flashlight that he kept\nwell hidden in his backpack or playing in a particularly well-lit spot. He knew\nit would only be a matter of time until something bad happened so he always\ntried to stay out of danger\u2019s way, preventing as much of it as possible. The\nentity acted as his main source of support ever since he had left his family\u2019s\nhouse and while there were a lot of things he\u2019d change about it, he felt\ngreatly thankful to have it in his life \u2013 it being a part of him meant having\nlittle to no secrets, and sometimes it made it easier to let go of the\nemotional load he tended to keep to himself.</p><p>Sighing and fogging the glass a bit, Fumikage replayed the events of\nthat night silently, picking the different moments he found to be the most\nfulfilling. If there was something interesting about being a street musician he\nwould\u2019ve named the tons of people he got to see every day, imagining their\nstories and talking to them to find out if he had been right about something.\nIt had become a little game only for himself, but ever since he started his new\n<i>profession</i> there had been two\nspecific people that stood out to him the most. He liked thinking about them,\nas they had showed him different sides to something he had always considered to\nbe very black and white.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The first one he met almost by chance, the memory replaying as an\noverused tape - it had been one of his busiest days and the only time to rest\nfor no more than fifteen minutes came around at dusk time, when he noticed that\npeople were already scattering towards their destinations without really paying\nattention to their surroundings. With his body feeling as tired as it could be,\nhe walked to his preferred resting spot, an old alley that kept him hidden from\nthe judgemental looks he got sometimes. A sturdy box had been placed against a\nwall God knows how long ago, and he had taken a liking to sitting there with\nhis guitar, tuning it or just playing whatever came to his mind as he let the\nstress go. It had been no different that day, just a regular afternoon, until\nhe heard voices coming from the entrance of the alley.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d one of the voices, a high-pitched, unmistakably\ngirly voice said with a hint of amazement in her tone. Without even tearing his\ngaze away from the instrument on his hands he felt as Dark Shadow came out, but\nFumikage felt too focused to even ask him to return. The people outside didn\u2019t\nseem to notice at all, and he had to thank the dim lighting of the narrow space\nfor that. \u201cHe seems like he has such a good Quirk too; he\u2019s probably talented\nwith it too.\u201d</p><p>Dark Shadow\u2019s low laugh resonated all the way to his body, and with a\nlow growl the young man wordlessly signalled that he wouldn\u2019t be in the mood to\nget interrupted any time soon. It had been a long day and social interaction\nwasn\u2019t exactly on his to-do list at the moment - it was his moment to be alone,\nhis mind needing the space to be able to function properly until the late\nnight. \u201cYou should give them a chance,\u201d the entity said before retreating into\nhim, \u201cthey look nice enough to have a chat with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOchaco-chan, why don\u2019t you just go talk to him?\u201d The girl that replied\nhad a slightly lower, more concerned tone as she whispered some more stuff he\ncouldn\u2019t have been bothered enough to eavesdrop in. But soon he heard\napproaching footsteps, and he closed his eyes in a futile attempt to camouflage\nhimself with the wall behind. \u201cExcuse me, I know that you must be resting, but\nmy friend and I wanted to congratulate you for the amazing performance.\u201d\nLooking up and opening his eyes he was met with the sight of two big eyes\nframed by two strands of green hair, staring at him as if trying to pierce\nright through his soul. She was alone, and he wondered if she had been the\nbraver one out of the two or if she had left her friend behind for another\nreason.</p><p>Once his eyes got used to what little light there was and he got a\nbetter look of her he recognized her as one of two girls who had been enjoying\nhis show for a long while and dancing along to some of his repertoire before he\ntook a break, and when he looked to the side he saw the friend that was with\nher talking on the phone before sending them a curious glance. The two of them\nformed a weird pair he thought, but by the way they acted with one another was\na sign of how strong their friendship was. Her features and gestures reminded\nhim to those of a frog, and he wondered if it had anything to do with her\nQuirk. \u201cI\u2019m truly glad you enjoyed the show,\u201d he replied shortly while putting\nhis guitar back on its case on the floor, unsure of whether they\u2019d hang around\nmore or if that\u2019d be the last time he\u2019d see them.</p><p>With a warm smile, the girl kneeled beside him and pulled her white\ncardigan a bit more over her chest, the breeze running along the streets\nalready getting colder with each passing second. He noticed she looked smaller\nbeneath the item of clothing. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the few people I\u2019ve met in my life\nthat I can tell has true passion for playing an instrument,\u201d she added without\na hint of hesitation. \u201cI wish I could play like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you play guitar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransverse flute and violin, actually - been playing since I was 8.\u201d\nSilence fell over them and Fumikage felt almost scared of breaking it, and\ninstead leaned against the wall behind - in moments like this he really wanted\nto be the kind of person that could keep alive a conversation without much\neffort, cursing his bad luck when it came to interacting with other people. She\ndidn\u2019t seem like she wanted to be a bother, but he did wonder the reason why\nshe had decided to casually spend some time with a simple street artist like\nhim. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not being a nuisance right now; you\u2019re awfully quiet.\u201d</p><p>Slightly taken aback by her words, he sighed and turned his attention\nback to her as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2026 enjoy having someone to talk to about\nthis sort of thing. Although I must admit I do feel undeserving of such nice\ncomments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndeserving? No way!\u201d she retorted, and it was only then that he\nrealized that he was opening up with someone he didn\u2019t even know the name of.\n\u201cI truly wish I could play like you. I was partly forced to learn so I never\nreally knew what playing for a passion was.\u201d His expression turned into one of\nunderstanding as he heard those words, and he smiled down at her with newfound\nempathy. Her own smile had faded, leaving behind a sad appearance. \u201cIt was all\nmy parents\u2019 doing as a means to encourage me I guess - I don\u2019t blame them\nfully, but I sometimes wonder if it would\u2019ve been different had I learnt\nbecause I wanted to. I could\u2019ve never dedicated my life to music like you do,\nhowever, but I like meeting people like you.\u201d</p><p>The way she spoke about her own experience brought back his doubts and\nhe was ready to tell her about that, but then another voice was heard from the\nalley entrance, making them both turn around. Her friend was calling out to her\n- <i>Tsuyu</i> with two cups of what seemed\nto be boba tea on her hands. With what sounded like a way too hopeful voice for\nhim, he quickly said, \u201cWill you two stick around for a bit longer? I\u2019m about to\ngo back out; if you\u2019d like to, you\u2019re more than welcome to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go, but I\u2019ll make sure to come back to watch you play again\nsomeday.\u201d</p><p>It was only then he realized he had never given her his name.</p><p>And as they said their goodbyes she got up and walked away, and the\nmemory came to an abrupt halt as the bus Fumikage was riding stopped so hard in\nfront of a red light it almost made him hit his head on the window and fall off\nhis seat. Mumbling incoherent curses as he sent a death glare toward the driver\nand wishing Dark Shadow would <i>not </i>come\nout to tease him about it he sunk back down on the comfortable leather, letting\nhis mind fly back to his trail of thoughts after checking he still had some\ntime to kill before reaching his stop looking through the window glass.</p><p>The second most interesting person he met wasn\u2019t someone who had come by\nto one of his performances - instead, he had been the one to meet <i>him</i>, almost on purpose.</p><p>It had been a late night of the last autumn, one that had had just the\nmost delightful weather and that seemed to be made specifically for everyone to\nenjoy. Armed with his beloved black jacket and a cigarette in his beak, he\nwalked downtown to his favourite bar, hoping to have a nice time while getting\naway from everything else in the world and its tendency to always make him feel\nunder pressure. He didn\u2019t expect the loud music coming from the inside as soon\nas he crossed the main doors of the place, or the way people were looking at\nthe band playing like they were the most amazing thing they had ever heard. <i>Just noise to the ears</i>, he thought as he\noccupied his usual place at a table close to the bar, <i>they all sound monotonous</i>.</p><p>However, as he listened more and more and downed a bottle of beer, even\na harsh sceptic like himself could find himself bobbing his head to the hard\nrock being played on the little stage. Fumikage analysed the four people (three\nboys and a girl) that were playing as if trying to discover a hidden secret,\nbut all he saw was four people just having fun\u2026 or three, to be honest. One of\nthem had an angry expression on his scarred face, a sour testament that\nwhatever was going through his mind wasn\u2019t the prettiest of thoughts; the bass\nhe played seemed to be in pretty bad shape, and he wondered how the guy could\neven play an instrument like that. His red and white hair stuck to his face\nthanks to the sweat running down his cheeks, and he looked rather threatening.</p><p>It took them another two songs before they finally said their goodbyes\nand walked off the stage to the sound of vigorous clapping, and by that point\nhe felt way too curious about them to just let them walk away. He carefully\nwatched as they high-fived each other, all smiling and seeming happy with their\nperformance, even the two-colour haired guy. He was the one that went to the\nbar, ordering drinks for him and all his friends, and that\u2019s when Fumikage\ndecided to take the chance to speak up. \u201cNice work,\u201d he said loud enough to be\nheard, and the stranger only sent him a side glance. \u201cIt is always a pleasure\nto see someone channel their feelings through music like you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a critic or something?\u201d the male replied and Fumikage only shook\nhis head, the bartender being told by the man to take the order to his\nbandmates after receiving the money for everything. When he was free again, he\napproached Tokoyami\u2019s table and plopped down on the chair in front of his and\nlet out a long sigh. \u201cI wish we received more comments like yours - it always\nseems like we play for no one in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone here seemed to be enjoying it greatly,\u201d Fumikage added without\nmuch spirit and already feeling a bit dizzy; the beer was starting to work its\nmagic on him, and he internally cursed at himself for not having something with\nalcohol in his system for the longest time. Closing his eyes and taking a deep\nbreath, he introduced himself before asking for one in return</p><p>Heterochromatic eyes posed on him and seemed to look at him up and down\nbefore reaching a verdict about whether or not he was trustworthy - he hoped he\nlooked the part. \u201cTodoroki,\u201d the stranger said as he reached out and offered\nhis hand above the table, careful about the bottles. Fumikage took it and gave\nit a little shake before turning around and asking for another beer. \u201cI\u2019m\nreally glad you enjoyed the show.\u201d</p><p>The name rung a distant bell in Tokoyami\u2019s mind but he ignored it,\ninstead choosing to talk about the band and its origins as Todoroki\u2019s drink was\nbrought to him. He was told that the others\u2019 names were Bakugou, Jirou and\nKaminari and that the four were high school friends that had the same goal in\nmind: creating meaningful music that could reach to the world and bring people\ntogether. It was beautiful, barely poetic, but there was still a long way to go\nand they knew it. \u201cAnd did you always play bass or did you start with guitar?\u201d</p><p>What he thought was an innocent question suddenly made Todoroki\u2019s body\ntense, his left hand gripping his own beer bottle just a bit tighter. \u201cI\nstarted with piano actually - my old man\u2026 he wanted me to play. Forced me,\nactually. He\u2019d given me a really strict teacher and would embarrass me if I\never got things wrong. You can say I started playing as some sort of revenge\ntowards him, but honestly I don\u2019t care anymore. I left my home about four years\nago when I was 16 for personal reasons and I have no plans of coming back any\ntime soon.\u201d The emotional turn of the conversation made Fumikage think he\u2019d\ncommitted a mistake by asking, but seeing how naturally Todoroki had opened up\nto him, someone he had just met, made him think that he wasn\u2019t entirely to\nblame for it. \u201cSorry for that,\u201d Todoroki added with a small smile tugging at\nthe corners of his lips, \u201cShouldn\u2019t have unleashed all of that on you when\nwe\u2019ve barely talked at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like knowing more about people,\u201d was the simple response to that,\nFumikage\u2019s curious expression turning into a relaxed one with a smile of his\nown, \u201cAnd you look like you could use an ear to let out some steam; don\u2019t\nworry, I\u2019ll be like the deepest tomb and keep everything within me.\u201d</p><p>And like that, he felt as if he had gained a new friend as the two\ntalked for a few more minutes about their love for music (Journey had,\ncoincidentally, been the first rock band Todoroki had liked as well, although\nit was their latest record that had amazed him), the band\u2019s next shows and how\nmuch the bassist was looking forward to the recording of their first album.\nTime passed and they were both just drunk enough to laugh at anything, and in\nbetween giggles and snorts they didn\u2019t hear an ash-blond man approaching or\nshouting at Todoroki until he was close enough to tap his shoulder. When the\ntwo looked up, Fumikage recognized him as the drummer of the band.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me you\u2019re getting drunk without us?\u201d He said with a growl,\nbut Fumikage could tell there was no ill intent behind his words - only\ntiredness. \u201cNo more tomfoolery then, we\u2019re going and if you take longer than\nfive fucking seconds to get out we\u2019re leaving without you.\u201d Despite the harsh\ntone and the deep frown, his lips were curved up in a smile, and he left\nwithout speaking another word. His pose denoted confidence, maybe more than a\nguy should ever have.</p><p>With a sigh, Todoroki left his third beer bottle on the table and\noffered his new acquaintance a gentle smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Bakugou can\nget quite\u2026 heavy sometimes. They actually left without me in two occasions, it\nwasn\u2019t pretty.\u201d He let out a short laugh, and above the talking and noises\naround them, Fumikage could hear a note of nervousness in his voice. \u201cHopefully\nwe\u2019ll see you again the next time.\u201d They both nodded in agreement and without\nmuch more left to be said Todoroki got up and left, leaving behind a trail of\nsomething akin to happiness.</p><p>The rest of the night was all but a blur for Tokoyami, and soon he was\nback on the bus on the present, the memory now returning to the back of his\nmind as if trying to hide itself from being seen again. He tried to think if\nthere was something escaping his mind amidst the events he remembered as he\npulled his jacket a bit more over his body, the cold of the night now reaching\nevery part of him and making a chill run down his spine. He looked out the\nwindow and noticed that it was almost time for him to get off, only a few more\nstops until he reached his destination.</p><p>But before he could do anything more someone tapped his shoulder,\nprompting him to turn around almost defensively. A green haired boy with big\nmatching eyes returned his surprised gaze with a smile proper of those who had\nno malice inside. He wondered when he had gotten on the bus and why he hadn\u2019t\nheard him. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry to have startled you!\u201d Even his voice was kind, and\nFumikage could only nod his head before starting to get out of his seat. \u201cI had\nthis feeling in my mind and just wanted to make sure I remembered you correctly\n- you went to Yuuei as well, right?\u201d The statement almost made Fumikage stop on\nhis tracks but he soon recovered and nodded once more, not really wanting to\nadd more to that. \u201cI knew it; my name is Izuku Midoriya, I was in the same year\nbut in a different class! I don\u2019t expect you to remember but it\u2019s surprising to\nfind you here.\u201d</p><p>If the name rung a bell in his mind he greatly ignored it, bent on\nforgetting most of his experience back at the school. \u201cI live close-by,\u201d he\nsaid, getting up while grabbing his guitar and now feeling slightly annoyed\nthat his past had somehow found the way to bite his back once again. \u201cExcuse me\nbut I must make this a short chat, this where I get off,\u201d He added as he\nclumsily made his way to the rear door and pressed the button to let the driver\nknow he had to stop. Curiosity got the better of him as he saw Midoriya\nfollowing his actions, and he started to think that he had encountered a\npossible stalker.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is my stop too,\u201d Izuku replied, \u201cmy mom moved to this\npart of the city last year and I\u2019m visiting her.\u201d Silence fell upon them as\nthey reached their destination, but before they could go their separate ways\nIzuku spoke up, the breeze lightly playing with his green locks. \u201cSo, what model\ndo you play?\u201d The question took Fumikage by surprise, and he replied as he\nopened his bag to get a cigarette and the lighter - he had wanted to leave but\nfor some reason he didn\u2019t want to go home just yet. It was the same feeling he\nhad whenever he met someone through his performances, and his gut was never\nwrong when it came to interesting people. They both leaned against a nearby\nwall and he asked Izuku if he played guitar as well, but the other guy shook\nhis head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d love to start. I just need to find time between\npractices - I already play three other instruments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would those be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiano, koto and end-blown flute! The first and last I perfected back at\nthe academy but I\u2019ve played koto ever since I was young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoto?\u201d Fumikage felt his\neyes widen at the sole mention of the traditional Japanese instrument, as he\nhad never met anyone his age that could even distinguish it from other stringed\ninstruments. His gaze fixated on the other\u2019s, he felt the need to know more\nabout him growing significantly. \u201cWhy did you choose that one?\u201d</p><p>Midoriya smiled and\nlooked at the ground beneath his feet, seemingly deep in thought. He took his\ntime to reply and for a moment Fumikage felt he had hit a sensitive cord within\nhim. \u201cMaybe because\u2026\u201d he started slowly, and Fumikage could tell he was trying\nto pick his words very carefully. \u201cMaybe it was because it can be a happy\ninstrument too. I can\u2019t explain the joy I get when it\u2019s on my hands, and it\u2019s\nvery easy to convey my own feelings through it. In that sense it\u2019s very similar\nto a guitar, and as long as I can showcase how I\u2019m feeling with it, I\u2019m okay. I\njust want to create music that\u2019s able to reach people\u2019s hearts and make them\nhappy as well.\u201d</p><p>Fumikage listened\ncarefully and witnessed as Izuku\u2019s expression went from soft and tired to\ncontent in a matter of seconds, and he was impressed to see the effect that\nmusic had on the stranger he couldn\u2019t even remember. Doubts swarmed his mind\nonce more and even if he tried his best to dissipate them he couldn\u2019t, choosing\ninstead to sigh and take a short puff from his cigarette as it would be easier\nthan let his mind wander - the smoke tasted more bitter now and his lips curved\ninto a disgusted gesture, but he still said nothing for another few seconds.\n\u201cYou are very passionate, I see. I am always glad to meet lovers of music, but\nyou might exceed everyone else I have met so far.\u201d Had he ever played for true\nhappiness? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>The words left his lips\nmindlessly, as if he was talking to himself rather than to someone else, yet it\nfelt almost like talking to a known friend. He felt comfortable, attributing it\nto the things they had in common (which he guessed were more than he knew), and\nhe was pleased he had actually decided to trust the good vibes the guy offered.\nHe threw one more glance at him before taking the cigarette between his right\nindex and thumb fingers and holding it up in front of his eyes, as if the smoke\nwas naught but an inconvenience. He was sure Midoriya couldn\u2019t understand where\nhe was coming from with this, but he certainly didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel the same\nhappiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\nMidoriya-san.\u201d Fumikage was quick to respond as he threw the cigarette to the\nopposite side of the street, watching it let out a few sparks as it hit the\nground. He thought that he\u2019d been doing that a lot that night, much to his\ndislike. \u201cBut I do hope to see you again - I often play nearby the Akihabara\nstation, maybe you can come see me one day.\u201d</p><p>He hoped that the small\nsmile he offered Midoriya was enough indication that he was glad to have had\nthat little talk with him, but he greatly ignored if the other man could even\nsee it; pulling away from the wall, he waved goodbye at him as he grabbed his\nguitar case and started walking fast until he turned around the corner. He\ndidn\u2019t even notice he was holding in a heavy breath until he let it out, long\nand almost making him dizzy.</p><p>As he made his way back\nhome, his heart beat faster too, his own thoughts playing against him - the\nwhole dilemma he felt about whether or not he had taken the right decisions in\nhis life. He froze in place and looked up to the sky, now able to see more\nstars thanks to the now more obvious darkness of the streets. They all seemed\nto hold so many untold secrets and he was partly glad he was only a spectator\nin the big scheme of things.</p><p>He felt himself going\nback to the very first place he started at, one where his uncertainties got the\nbest of him instead of letting him advance and take down the many obstacles he\nencountered. He felt himself going back to those who had impacted him the most,\nand tried his best to attach whatever emotion felt best for each of them - <i>innocence</i> for Tsuyu, <i>rebellion</i> for Todoroki and <i>happiness</i> for Midoriya. Scoffing, he\nremembered there was still so much he could learn from everyone around him, and\nas he pondered the different ways he could implement that newfound knowledge on\nhimself he resumed his walk.</p><p>He felt himself getting\nlost again, but this time he\u2019d make sure to bring himself out of it all to find\nthe spark he had lost along the way.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i><b>A/N</b>: My longest piece yet (which I wrote thinking that the word count had to be a lot longer than it actually was, so much of this right here is brand new content) and it was for the amazing Revelry in The Dark <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mC8WpsHhFuy8nDJEkC08dlw\">@tokoyamizine</a>!

He gently blew the smoke out\nof his lungs, tracing small images into the night air. He studied them\nabsently, letting his expression soften with a smile.</p><p>It had been a calm night overall among the citizens that passed by the\narea he was in. Although he was surprised with how things had gone so smoothly,\nhe also wished there would&rsquo;ve been more bustle in the city &ndash; he hadn&rsquo;t made\nmore than &yen;6.550, and even if he knew better than to complain about what he\ncould earn, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel disappointed with how the night turned\nout. Still, it was well past 1am and he wanted to go back home as soon as he\ncould, so he lit another cigarette and took a big puff. <i>For the long road ahead</i>, he told himself as the bitter taste of\ncinder reclaimed its place on his tongue.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to be all over the place on the way back as he\nwalked slowly, the soft breeze sending a shiver down his spine as he gripped\nthe handles of his guitar case a bit tighter - Fumikage was never a nostalgic\nperson per se, but anyone with a mind-reading Quirk nearby might think\notherwise. It was one of those nights where he&rsquo;d end up doubting himself and\nhis goals throughout the hours, the various memories coming back to him not\nhelping at all with his sentimentality. He only hoped he could get some sleep\nalong the way, and he looked up at the night sky for a moment only to see a few\ndots scattered all across the dark canvas above. The brightest stars seemed to\ntwinkle as if saying hello, and he realized how much he missed being able to\nsee more of them, of their beauty.</p><p>A memory popped up in his head then, a simple image of him gazing at a\nbeautiful starry sky while sitting on the roof of his house a few years back.\nThe sheer contrast of the white and red dots against the deep blue sky always\nused to leave him in awe of the world around him, and sometimes he brought his\nguitar along to sing a ballad to the moon in hopes of making the feeling of\nsolitude go away, something not even the entity inside of him could achieve. He\nremembered when he was younger and his father used to come along, too, the\neverlasting support for his son making the young man&rsquo;s heart swell with joy.</p><p>It had also been in that same rooftop that he had had the pleasure of\nlistening to what would quickly become his favourite album of all time,\nJourney&rsquo;s Escape &ndash; it ignited the spark needed to fuel his passion for music,\nsomething that had existed ever since he was a toddler but that had never been\ntruly cemented into him. It was no surprise for anyone when he had claimed he\nwanted to apply to Yuuei, Japan&rsquo;s most prestigious performing arts conservatory\nknown to train the best musicians in the country.</p><p>Tokoyami hopped on the last bus of the night and threw away his half\nsmoked cigarette while remembering that on that same rooftop, too, had been\nwhen he first doubted himself years later; if he was doing the right thing, if\nit was all just for a whim, or if playing music for a living was truly the end\nof the road for him and his ambitions. He wanted to know more about the world\nand there was so much more to learn, and he didn&rsquo;t want to feel like he was\njust another wasted talent. Those doubts led him to drop the future Yuuei had\noffered him once he graduated, instead turning to the streets as a source of\nliving while playing whatever music he wanted on his beloved instrument.</p><p>He felt a small rustling beside him along with the sensation of\nsomething <i>leaving</i> his own being, a\nsign that he was no longer the only one in that bus besides the driver -\nsometimes he did hate having a sentient Quirk. &ldquo;You sound like you&rsquo;re having a\nhard time,&rdquo; said Dark Shadow from beside him, but it didn&rsquo;t faze Fumikage in\nthe slightest. The bright light of the vehicle kept it controlled, and for that\nhe was immensely thankful. &ldquo;You can talk to me, you know? I can sense when\nyou&rsquo;re not okay, and your thoughts are yelling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get back in,&rdquo; was the only reply that left him as he put his forehead\nto the window glass, the cold material doing little to help his tiredness.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not needed now. I am only&hellip;&rdquo; but the words escaped him before he could\nexplain anything, maybe because he himself wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure of what was\ngoing on through his mind; the images fumbled together and a small headache was\nstarting to appear. &ldquo;I am only thinking.&rdquo; And with that, he was left alone\nagain as Dark Shadow retreated, a dejected look on its face.</p><p>Whenever his insecurities appeared there was always Dark Shadow to help,\nand the two had been good friends ever since his Quirk first manifested.\nDespite being hard to manage when in dark places, Tokoyami made sure to always\nhave at least a source of light on him, be it a small flashlight that he kept\nwell hidden in his backpack or playing in a particularly well-lit spot. He knew\nit would only be a matter of time until something bad happened so he always\ntried to stay out of danger&rsquo;s way, preventing as much of it as possible. The\nentity acted as his main source of support ever since he had left his family&rsquo;s\nhouse and while there were a lot of things he&rsquo;d change about it, he felt\ngreatly thankful to have it in his life &ndash; it being a part of him meant having\nlittle to no secrets, and sometimes it made it easier to let go of the\nemotional load he tended to keep to himself.</p><p>Sighing and fogging the glass a bit, Fumikage replayed the events of\nthat night silently, picking the different moments he found to be the most\nfulfilling. If there was something interesting about being a street musician he\nwould&rsquo;ve named the tons of people he got to see every day, imagining their\nstories and talking to them to find out if he had been right about something.\nIt had become a little game only for himself, but ever since he started his new\n<i>profession</i> there had been two\nspecific people that stood out to him the most. He liked thinking about them,\nas they had showed him different sides to something he had always considered to\nbe very black and white.</p><p>The first one he met almost by chance, the memory replaying as an\noverused tape - it had been one of his busiest days and the only time to rest\nfor no more than fifteen minutes came around at dusk time, when he noticed that\npeople were already scattering towards their destinations without really paying\nattention to their surroundings. With his body feeling as tired as it could be,\nhe walked to his preferred resting spot, an old alley that kept him hidden from\nthe judgemental looks he got sometimes. A sturdy box had been placed against a\nwall God knows how long ago, and he had taken a liking to sitting there with\nhis guitar, tuning it or just playing whatever came to his mind as he let the\nstress go. It had been no different that day, just a regular afternoon, until\nhe heard voices coming from the entrance of the alley.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; one of the voices, a high-pitched, unmistakably\ngirly voice said with a hint of amazement in her tone. Without even tearing his\ngaze away from the instrument on his hands he felt as Dark Shadow came out, but\nFumikage felt too focused to even ask him to return. The people outside didn&rsquo;t\nseem to notice at all, and he had to thank the dim lighting of the narrow space\nfor that. &ldquo;He seems like he has such a good Quirk too; he&rsquo;s probably talented\nwith it too.&rdquo;</p><p>Dark Shadow&rsquo;s low laugh resonated all the way to his body, and with a\nlow growl the young man wordlessly signalled that he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the mood to\nget interrupted any time soon. It had been a long day and social interaction\nwasn&rsquo;t exactly on his to-do list at the moment - it was his moment to be alone,\nhis mind needing the space to be able to function properly until the late\nnight. &ldquo;You should give them a chance,&rdquo; the entity said before retreating into\nhim, &ldquo;they look nice enough to have a chat with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ochaco-chan, why don&rsquo;t you just go talk to him?&rdquo; The girl that replied\nhad a slightly lower, more concerned tone as she whispered some more stuff he\ncouldn&rsquo;t have been bothered enough to eavesdrop in. But soon he heard\napproaching footsteps, and he closed his eyes in a futile attempt to camouflage\nhimself with the wall behind. &ldquo;Excuse me, I know that you must be resting, but\nmy friend and I wanted to congratulate you for the amazing performance.&rdquo;\nLooking up and opening his eyes he was met with the sight of two big eyes\nframed by two strands of green hair, staring at him as if trying to pierce\nright through his soul. She was alone, and he wondered if she had been the\nbraver one out of the two or if she had left her friend behind for another\nreason.</p><p>Once his eyes got used to what little light there was and he got a\nbetter look of her he recognized her as one of two girls who had been enjoying\nhis show for a long while and dancing along to some of his repertoire before he\ntook a break, and when he looked to the side he saw the friend that was with\nher talking on the phone before sending them a curious glance. The two of them\nformed a weird pair he thought, but by the way they acted with one another was\na sign of how strong their friendship was. Her features and gestures reminded\nhim to those of a frog, and he wondered if it had anything to do with her\nQuirk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly glad you enjoyed the show,&rdquo; he replied shortly while putting\nhis guitar back on its case on the floor, unsure of whether they&rsquo;d hang around\nmore or if that&rsquo;d be the last time he&rsquo;d see them.</p><p>With a warm smile, the girl kneeled beside him and pulled her white\ncardigan a bit more over her chest, the breeze running along the streets\nalready getting colder with each passing second. He noticed she looked smaller\nbeneath the item of clothing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the few people I&rsquo;ve met in my life\nthat I can tell has true passion for playing an instrument,&rdquo; she added without\na hint of hesitation. &ldquo;I wish I could play like you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you play guitar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Transverse flute and violin, actually - been playing since I was 8.&rdquo;\nSilence fell over them and Fumikage felt almost scared of breaking it, and\ninstead leaned against the wall behind - in moments like this he really wanted\nto be the kind of person that could keep alive a conversation without much\neffort, cursing his bad luck when it came to interacting with other people. She\ndidn&rsquo;t seem like she wanted to be a bother, but he did wonder the reason why\nshe had decided to casually spend some time with a simple street artist like\nhim. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not being a nuisance right now; you&rsquo;re awfully quiet.&rdquo;</p><p>Slightly taken aback by her words, he sighed and turned his attention\nback to her as he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&hellip; enjoy having someone to talk to about\nthis sort of thing. Although I must admit I do feel undeserving of such nice\ncomments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Undeserving? No way!&rdquo; she retorted, and it was only then that he\nrealized that he was opening up with someone he didn&rsquo;t even know the name of.\n&ldquo;I truly wish I could play like you. I was partly forced to learn so I never\nreally knew what playing for a passion was.&rdquo; His expression turned into one of\nunderstanding as he heard those words, and he smiled down at her with newfound\nempathy. Her own smile had faded, leaving behind a sad appearance. &ldquo;It was all\nmy parents&rsquo; doing as a means to encourage me I guess - I don&rsquo;t blame them\nfully, but I sometimes wonder if it would&rsquo;ve been different had I learnt\nbecause I wanted to. I could&rsquo;ve never dedicated my life to music like you do,\nhowever, but I like meeting people like you.&rdquo;</p><p>The way she spoke about her own experience brought back his doubts and\nhe was ready to tell her about that, but then another voice was heard from the\nalley entrance, making them both turn around. Her friend was calling out to her\n- <i>Tsuyu</i> with two cups of what seemed\nto be boba tea on her hands. With what sounded like a way too hopeful voice for\nhim, he quickly said, &ldquo;Will you two stick around for a bit longer? I&rsquo;m about to\ngo back out; if you&rsquo;d like to, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to go, but I&rsquo;ll make sure to come back to watch you play again\nsomeday.&rdquo;</p><p>It was only then he realized he had never given her his name.</p><p>And as they said their goodbyes she got up and walked away, and the\nmemory came to an abrupt halt as the bus Fumikage was riding stopped so hard in\nfront of a red light it almost made him hit his head on the window and fall off\nhis seat. Mumbling incoherent curses as he sent a death glare toward the driver\nand wishing Dark Shadow would <i>not </i>come\nout to tease him about it he sunk back down on the comfortable leather, letting\nhis mind fly back to his trail of thoughts after checking he still had some\ntime to kill before reaching his stop looking through the window glass.</p><p>The second most interesting person he met wasn&rsquo;t someone who had come by\nto one of his performances - instead, he had been the one to meet <i>him</i>, almost on purpose.</p><p>It had been a late night of the last autumn, one that had had just the\nmost delightful weather and that seemed to be made specifically for everyone to\nenjoy. Armed with his beloved black jacket and a cigarette in his beak, he\nwalked downtown to his favourite bar, hoping to have a nice time while getting\naway from everything else in the world and its tendency to always make him feel\nunder pressure. He didn&rsquo;t expect the loud music coming from the inside as soon\nas he crossed the main doors of the place, or the way people were looking at\nthe band playing like they were the most amazing thing they had ever heard. <i>Just noise to the ears</i>, he thought as he\noccupied his usual place at a table close to the bar, <i>they all sound monotonous</i>.</p><p>However, as he listened more and more and downed a bottle of beer, even\na harsh sceptic like himself could find himself bobbing his head to the hard\nrock being played on the little stage. Fumikage analysed the four people (three\nboys and a girl) that were playing as if trying to discover a hidden secret,\nbut all he saw was four people just having fun&hellip; or three, to be honest. One of\nthem had an angry expression on his scarred face, a sour testament that\nwhatever was going through his mind wasn&rsquo;t the prettiest of thoughts; the bass\nhe played seemed to be in pretty bad shape, and he wondered how the guy could\neven play an instrument like that. His red and white hair stuck to his face\nthanks to the sweat running down his cheeks, and he looked rather threatening.</p><p>It took them another two songs before they finally said their goodbyes\nand walked off the stage to the sound of vigorous clapping, and by that point\nhe felt way too curious about them to just let them walk away. He carefully\nwatched as they high-fived each other, all smiling and seeming happy with their\nperformance, even the two-colour haired guy. He was the one that went to the\nbar, ordering drinks for him and all his friends, and that&rsquo;s when Fumikage\ndecided to take the chance to speak up. &ldquo;Nice work,&rdquo; he said loud enough to be\nheard, and the stranger only sent him a side glance. &ldquo;It is always a pleasure\nto see someone channel their feelings through music like you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You a critic or something?&rdquo; the male replied and Fumikage only shook\nhis head, the bartender being told by the man to take the order to his\nbandmates after receiving the money for everything. When he was free again, he\napproached Tokoyami&rsquo;s table and plopped down on the chair in front of his and\nlet out a long sigh. &ldquo;I wish we received more comments like yours - it always\nseems like we play for no one in particular.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everyone here seemed to be enjoying it greatly,&rdquo; Fumikage added without\nmuch spirit and already feeling a bit dizzy; the beer was starting to work its\nmagic on him, and he internally cursed at himself for not having something with\nalcohol in his system for the longest time. Closing his eyes and taking a deep\nbreath, he introduced himself before asking for one in return</p><p>Heterochromatic eyes posed on him and seemed to look at him up and down\nbefore reaching a verdict about whether or not he was trustworthy - he hoped he\nlooked the part. &ldquo;Todoroki,&rdquo; the stranger said as he reached out and offered\nhis hand above the table, careful about the bottles. Fumikage took it and gave\nit a little shake before turning around and asking for another beer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\nreally glad you enjoyed the show.&rdquo;</p><p>The name rung a distant bell in Tokoyami&rsquo;s mind but he ignored it,\ninstead choosing to talk about the band and its origins as Todoroki&rsquo;s drink was\nbrought to him. He was told that the others&rsquo; names were Bakugou, Jirou and\nKaminari and that the four were high school friends that had the same goal in\nmind: creating meaningful music that could reach to the world and bring people\ntogether. It was beautiful, barely poetic, but there was still a long way to go\nand they knew it. &ldquo;And did you always play bass or did you start with guitar?&rdquo;</p><p>What he thought was an innocent question suddenly made Todoroki&rsquo;s body\ntense, his left hand gripping his own beer bottle just a bit tighter. &ldquo;I\nstarted with piano actually - my old man&hellip; he wanted me to play. Forced me,\nactually. He&rsquo;d given me a really strict teacher and would embarrass me if I\never got things wrong. You can say I started playing as some sort of revenge\ntowards him, but honestly I don&rsquo;t care anymore. I left my home about four years\nago when I was 16 for personal reasons and I have no plans of coming back any\ntime soon.&rdquo; The emotional turn of the conversation made Fumikage think he&rsquo;d\ncommitted a mistake by asking, but seeing how naturally Todoroki had opened up\nto him, someone he had just met, made him think that he wasn&rsquo;t entirely to\nblame for it. &ldquo;Sorry for that,&rdquo; Todoroki added with a small smile tugging at\nthe corners of his lips, &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have unleashed all of that on you when\nwe&rsquo;ve barely talked at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like knowing more about people,&rdquo; was the simple response to that,\nFumikage&rsquo;s curious expression turning into a relaxed one with a smile of his\nown, &ldquo;And you look like you could use an ear to let out some steam; don&rsquo;t\nworry, I&rsquo;ll be like the deepest tomb and keep everything within me.&rdquo;</p><p>And like that, he felt as if he had gained a new friend as the two\ntalked for a few more minutes about their love for music (Journey had,\ncoincidentally, been the first rock band Todoroki had liked as well, although\nit was their latest record that had amazed him), the band&rsquo;s next shows and how\nmuch the bassist was looking forward to the recording of their first album.\nTime passed and they were both just drunk enough to laugh at anything, and in\nbetween giggles and snorts they didn&rsquo;t hear an ash-blond man approaching or\nshouting at Todoroki until he was close enough to tap his shoulder. When the\ntwo looked up, Fumikage recognized him as the drummer of the band.</p><p>&ldquo;You telling me you&rsquo;re getting drunk without us?&rdquo; He said with a growl,\nbut Fumikage could tell there was no ill intent behind his words - only\ntiredness. &ldquo;No more tomfoolery then, we&rsquo;re going and if you take longer than\nfive fucking seconds to get out we&rsquo;re leaving without you.&rdquo; Despite the harsh\ntone and the deep frown, his lips were curved up in a smile, and he left\nwithout speaking another word. His pose denoted confidence, maybe more than a\nguy should ever have.</p><p>With a sigh, Todoroki left his third beer bottle on the table and\noffered his new acquaintance a gentle smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that, Bakugou can\nget quite&hellip; heavy sometimes. They actually left without me in two occasions, it\nwasn&rsquo;t pretty.&rdquo; He let out a short laugh, and above the talking and noises\naround them, Fumikage could hear a note of nervousness in his voice. &ldquo;Hopefully\nwe&rsquo;ll see you again the next time.&rdquo; They both nodded in agreement and without\nmuch more left to be said Todoroki got up and left, leaving behind a trail of\nsomething akin to happiness.</p><p>The rest of the night was all but a blur for Tokoyami, and soon he was\nback on the bus on the present, the memory now returning to the back of his\nmind as if trying to hide itself from being seen again. He tried to think if\nthere was something escaping his mind amidst the events he remembered as he\npulled his jacket a bit more over his body, the cold of the night now reaching\nevery part of him and making a chill run down his spine. He looked out the\nwindow and noticed that it was almost time for him to get off, only a few more\nstops until he reached his destination.</p><p>But before he could do anything more someone tapped his shoulder,\nprompting him to turn around almost defensively. A green haired boy with big\nmatching eyes returned his surprised gaze with a smile proper of those who had\nno malice inside. He wondered when he had gotten on the bus and why he hadn&rsquo;t\nheard him. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to have startled you!&rdquo; Even his voice was kind, and\nFumikage could only nod his head before starting to get out of his seat. &ldquo;I had\nthis feeling in my mind and just wanted to make sure I remembered you correctly\n- you went to Yuuei as well, right?&rdquo; The statement almost made Fumikage stop on\nhis tracks but he soon recovered and nodded once more, not really wanting to\nadd more to that. &ldquo;I knew it; my name is Izuku Midoriya, I was in the same year\nbut in a different class! I don&rsquo;t expect you to remember but it&rsquo;s surprising to\nfind you here.&rdquo;</p><p>If the name rung a bell in his mind he greatly ignored it, bent on\nforgetting most of his experience back at the school. &ldquo;I live close-by,&rdquo; he\nsaid, getting up while grabbing his guitar and now feeling slightly annoyed\nthat his past had somehow found the way to bite his back once again. &ldquo;Excuse me\nbut I must make this a short chat, this where I get off,&rdquo; He added as he\nclumsily made his way to the rear door and pressed the button to let the driver\nknow he had to stop. Curiosity got the better of him as he saw Midoriya\nfollowing his actions, and he started to think that he had encountered a\npossible stalker.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, this is my stop too,&rdquo; Izuku replied, &ldquo;my mom moved to this\npart of the city last year and I&rsquo;m visiting her.&rdquo; Silence fell upon them as\nthey reached their destination, but before they could go their separate ways\nIzuku spoke up, the breeze lightly playing with his green locks. &ldquo;So, what model\ndo you play?&rdquo; The question took Fumikage by surprise, and he replied as he\nopened his bag to get a cigarette and the lighter - he had wanted to leave but\nfor some reason he didn&rsquo;t want to go home just yet. It was the same feeling he\nhad whenever he met someone through his performances, and his gut was never\nwrong when it came to interesting people. They both leaned against a nearby\nwall and he asked Izuku if he played guitar as well, but the other guy shook\nhis head. &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;d love to start. I just need to find time between\npractices - I already play three other instruments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what would those be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Piano, koto and end-blown flute! The first and last I perfected back at\nthe academy but I&rsquo;ve played koto ever since I was young.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Koto?&rdquo; Fumikage felt his\neyes widen at the sole mention of the traditional Japanese instrument, as he\nhad never met anyone his age that could even distinguish it from other stringed\ninstruments. His gaze fixated on the other&rsquo;s, he felt the need to know more\nabout him growing significantly. &ldquo;Why did you choose that one?&rdquo;</p><p>Midoriya smiled and\nlooked at the ground beneath his feet, seemingly deep in thought. He took his\ntime to reply and for a moment Fumikage felt he had hit a sensitive cord within\nhim. &ldquo;Maybe because&hellip;&rdquo; he started slowly, and Fumikage could tell he was trying\nto pick his words very carefully. &ldquo;Maybe it was because it can be a happy\ninstrument too. I can&rsquo;t explain the joy I get when it&rsquo;s on my hands, and it&rsquo;s\nvery easy to convey my own feelings through it. In that sense it&rsquo;s very similar\nto a guitar, and as long as I can showcase how I&rsquo;m feeling with it, I&rsquo;m okay. I\njust want to create music that&rsquo;s able to reach people&rsquo;s hearts and make them\nhappy as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Fumikage listened\ncarefully and witnessed as Izuku&rsquo;s expression went from soft and tired to\ncontent in a matter of seconds, and he was impressed to see the effect that\nmusic had on the stranger he couldn&rsquo;t even remember. Doubts swarmed his mind\nonce more and even if he tried his best to dissipate them he couldn&rsquo;t, choosing\ninstead to sigh and take a short puff from his cigarette as it would be easier\nthan let his mind wander - the smoke tasted more bitter now and his lips curved\ninto a disgusted gesture, but he still said nothing for another few seconds.\n&ldquo;You are very passionate, I see. I am always glad to meet lovers of music, but\nyou might exceed everyone else I have met so far.&rdquo; Had he ever played for true\nhappiness? He couldn&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>The words left his lips\nmindlessly, as if he was talking to himself rather than to someone else, yet it\nfelt almost like talking to a known friend. He felt comfortable, attributing it\nto the things they had in common (which he guessed were more than he knew), and\nhe was pleased he had actually decided to trust the good vibes the guy offered.\nHe threw one more glance at him before taking the cigarette between his right\nindex and thumb fingers and holding it up in front of his eyes, as if the smoke\nwas naught but an inconvenience. He was sure Midoriya couldn&rsquo;t understand where\nhe was coming from with this, but he certainly didn&rsquo;t mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you feel the same\nhappiness?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go,\nMidoriya-san.&rdquo; Fumikage was quick to respond as he threw the cigarette to the\nopposite side of the street, watching it let out a few sparks as it hit the\nground. He thought that he&rsquo;d been doing that a lot that night, much to his\ndislike. &ldquo;But I do hope to see you again - I often play nearby the Akihabara\nstation, maybe you can come see me one day.&rdquo;</p><p>He hoped that the small\nsmile he offered Midoriya was enough indication that he was glad to have had\nthat little talk with him, but he greatly ignored if the other man could even\nsee it; pulling away from the wall, he waved goodbye at him as he grabbed his\nguitar case and started walking fast until he turned around the corner. He\ndidn&rsquo;t even notice he was holding in a heavy breath until he let it out, long\nand almost making him dizzy.</p><p>As he made his way back\nhome, his heart beat faster too, his own thoughts playing against him - the\nwhole dilemma he felt about whether or not he had taken the right decisions in\nhis life. He froze in place and looked up to the sky, now able to see more\nstars thanks to the now more obvious darkness of the streets. They all seemed\nto hold so many untold secrets and he was partly glad he was only a spectator\nin the big scheme of things.</p><p>He felt himself going\nback to the very first place he started at, one where his uncertainties got the\nbest of him instead of letting him advance and take down the many obstacles he\nencountered. He felt himself going back to those who had impacted him the most,\nand tried his best to attach whatever emotion felt best for each of them - <i>innocence</i> for Tsuyu, <i>rebellion</i> for Todoroki and <i>happiness</i> for Midoriya. Scoffing, he\nremembered there was still so much he could learn from everyone around him, and\nas he pondered the different ways he could implement that newfound knowledge on\nhimself he resumed his walk.</p><p>He felt himself getting\nlost again, but this time he&rsquo;d make sure to bring himself out of it all to find\nthe spark he had lost along the way.</p>",

I&rsquo;m super happy to have been able to work with the amazing people behind it and thoroughly hope you all can enjoy the content if you bought it - their blog will also post every completed piece, so make sure to check that out! &hearts;</i></p>\n<p><i>Word Count: 5.125</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>With a cigarette almost completely out hanging loosely between the edges\nof his beak, Fumikage Tokoyami looked around the empty street before tossing\nthe cigarette onto the ground and stomping it out. He gently blew the smoke out\nof his lungs, tracing small images into the night air. He studied them\nabsently, letting his expression soften with a smile.</p>\n<p>It had been a calm night overall among the citizens that passed by the\narea he was in. Although he was surprised with how things had gone so smoothly,\nhe also wished there would&rsquo;ve been more bustle in the city &ndash; he hadn&rsquo;t made\nmore than &yen;6.550, and even if he knew better than to complain about what he\ncould earn, he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel disappointed with how the night turned\nout. Still, it was well past 1am and he wanted to go back home as soon as he\ncould, so he lit another cigarette and took a big puff. <i>For the long road ahead</i>, he told himself as the bitter taste of\ncinder reclaimed its place on his tongue.</p>\n<p>His thoughts seemed to be all over the place on the way back as he\nwalked slowly, the soft breeze sending a shiver down his spine as he gripped\nthe handles of his guitar case a bit tighter - Fumikage was never a nostalgic\nperson per se, but anyone with a mind-reading Quirk nearby might think\notherwise. It was one of those nights where he&rsquo;d end up doubting himself and\nhis goals throughout the hours, the various memories coming back to him not\nhelping at all with his sentimentality. He only hoped he could get some sleep\nalong the way, and he looked up at the night sky for a moment only to see a few\ndots scattered all across the dark canvas above. The brightest stars seemed to\ntwinkle as if saying hello, and he realized how much he missed being able to\nsee more of them, of their beauty.</p>\n<p>A memory popped up in his head then, a simple image of him gazing at a\nbeautiful starry sky while sitting on the roof of his house a few years back.\nThe sheer contrast of the white and red dots against the deep blue sky always\nused to leave him in awe of the world around him, and sometimes he brought his\nguitar along to sing a ballad to the moon in hopes of making the feeling of\nsolitude go away, something not even the entity inside of him could achieve. He\nremembered when he was younger and his father used to come along, too, the\neverlasting support for his son making the young man&rsquo;s heart swell with joy.</p>\n<p>It had also been in that same rooftop that he had had the pleasure of\nlistening to what would quickly become his favourite album of all time,\nJourney&rsquo;s Escape &ndash; it ignited the spark needed to fuel his passion for music,\nsomething that had existed ever since he was a toddler but that had never been\ntruly cemented into him. It was no surprise for anyone when he had claimed he\nwanted to apply to Yuuei, Japan&rsquo;s most prestigious performing arts conservatory\nknown to train the best musicians in the country.</p>\n<p>Tokoyami hopped on the last bus of the night and threw away his half\nsmoked cigarette while remembering that on that same rooftop, too, had been\nwhen he first doubted himself years later; if he was doing the right thing, if\nit was all just for a whim, or if playing music for a living was truly the end\nof the road for him and his ambitions. He wanted to know more about the world\nand there was so much more to learn, and he didn&rsquo;t want to feel like he was\njust another wasted talent. Those doubts led him to drop the future Yuuei had\noffered him once he graduated, instead turning to the streets as a source of\nliving while playing whatever music he wanted on his beloved instrument.</p>\n<p>He felt a small rustling beside him along with the sensation of\nsomething <i>leaving</i> his own being, a\nsign that he was no longer the only one in that bus besides the driver -\nsometimes he did hate having a sentient Quirk. &ldquo;You sound like you&rsquo;re having a\nhard time,&rdquo; said Dark Shadow from beside him, but it didn&rsquo;t faze Fumikage in\nthe slightest. The bright light of the vehicle kept it controlled, and for that\nhe was immensely thankful. &ldquo;You can talk to me, you know? I can sense when\nyou&rsquo;re not okay, and your thoughts are yelling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Get back in,&rdquo; was the only reply that left him as he put his forehead\nto the window glass, the cold material doing little to help his tiredness.\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not needed now. I am only&hellip;&rdquo; but the words escaped him before he could\nexplain anything, maybe because he himself wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure of what was\ngoing on through his mind; the images fumbled together and a small headache was\nstarting to appear. &ldquo;I am only thinking.&rdquo; And with that, he was left alone\nagain as Dark Shadow retreated, a dejected look on its face.</p>\n<p>Whenever his insecurities appeared there was always Dark Shadow to help,\nand the two had been good friends ever since his Quirk first manifested.\nDespite being hard to manage when in dark places, Tokoyami made sure to always\nhave at least a source of light on him, be it a small flashlight that he kept\nwell hidden in his backpack or playing in a particularly well-lit spot. He knew\nit would only be a matter of time until something bad happened so he always\ntried to stay out of danger&rsquo;s way, preventing as much of it as possible. The\nentity acted as his main source of support ever since he had left his family&rsquo;s\nhouse and while there were a lot of things he&rsquo;d change about it, he felt\ngreatly thankful to have it in his life &ndash; it being a part of him meant having\nlittle to no secrets, and sometimes it made it easier to let go of the\nemotional load he tended to keep to himself.</p>\n<p>Sighing and fogging the glass a bit, Fumikage replayed the events of\nthat night silently, picking the different moments he found to be the most\nfulfilling. If there was something interesting about being a street musician he\nwould&rsquo;ve named the tons of people he got to see every day, imagining their\nstories and talking to them to find out if he had been right about something.\nIt had become a little game only for himself, but ever since he started his new\n<i>profession</i> there had been two\nspecific people that stood out to him the most. He liked thinking about them,\nas they had showed him different sides to something he had always considered to\nbe very black and white.</p>\n</p>",

Her child had an obvious disadvantage in this super powered world and for once she didnt know what to do. So she spent days just patrolling quirkless children forums and reading article after article of advice. She was just afraid. So Inko tried to give her son as much of an upper hand as possible. Feeding into his love of learning and trying to give him as much real world skills as possible so he too could contribute to society even without a quirk. Though he has one now she still thinks a lot of those skills have come in handy. </p><p>\ud83e\udd66As Izuku got older she let loose on the boundaries and the two of them kind of became a team. Though her son constantly gave her heart attacks she began to treat him less like a child, and more like the adult she slowly can see him as. He wont be her baby forever, and as much as it scares her she needs to let her baby fly out of the nest. </p><p>With a side of!</p><p>Mirio Togata!</p><p>\ud83e\udd50Togata dads parenting can be described in one word. Coddling. He is just not the disciplinary type, and the most he had ever done with his son was ground him for a day. Yeah, terrible, he knows! But he just cant help himself when his little sunshine looks at him with those eyes. </p><p>\ud83e\udd50He for the life of him can not let go. He just wants Mirio to remain his little boy forever and forever and it takes the counseling of many friends that it isnt right for him to do that. Mirio was 18, an adult. An adult who didnt even know how to cook his own meals, and do his own laundry. It was time to stop the coddling. </p><p>\ud83e\udd50Mirio is a great guy! Dont get me wrong! But he is a bit spoiled. Not always understanding what others may feel (it&rsquo;s not ok to flash random underclassman) and only thinking about himself. He doesnt mean it to be rude though and always apologizes if he offended someone. </p><p>\ud83e\udd50None of this means Mirios dad is a terrible father though. We arent all perfect after all. Togata dad always pushed Mirio to work harder at everything! Never letting him quit once he starts and always motivating him to go the extra mile. Support can go a long way in a child&rsquo;s life. </p><p>\ud83e\udd50Poor Togata dad though would cry when he becomes an empty nester. Calling his son everyday until he finally is comfortable enough to let him live an adult life. It just a big adjustment for everyone after all, and when Mirio is thriving then his dad is just as happy. </p>",

Certainly nothing that couldn&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>But curiosity won out in the end and, still lackadaisically scrubbing the toothbrush across my teeth, I turned to walk into my bedroom.
