The spot you\nhad avoided the whole night suddenly catching your attention. \n</p><p>\n\tThe pool table was surrounded by\npeople- man and women with seductive smiles and hunting eyes-\nwatching the people playing. The Bird Clique, Clint and Sam, played\nagainst The American Geriatric Duo, Steve and Bucky. Your smile was\ninstantaneous, the four idiot\u2019s bickering amusing to watch even\nfrom afar. \n</p><p>\n\tBlue eyes focused on you, a smile\nspreading on both your faces. You let your eyes linger on the man for\nthe first time that night: broad shoulders covered by an obscenely\nwell tailored suit, top buttons of his shirt undone, his hair was\nslicked back providing a perfect view of his face as he leaned\nagainst his pool stick. Bucky eyed you with the same curiosity,\nmaking a shiver run down your spine as his eyes came back to yours.\nWith a raised brow and a nod he silently complimented your look.</p><p>\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 can you keep up?\u201d Your\nattention snapped back to the god besides you, Thor looked at you\nwith a defying grin on his lips. Eight shots lined the bar, you\nfrowned, knowing <i>exactly </i>where\nthis was going. \u201cOr are you already running out of <i>midgardian</i>\nstamina?

Deciding to take\na break you walked back to the bar, sipping your water you smiled at\nthe scene: your friends on the dance floor- it was good to see them\nlike this, happy and silly, forgetting for at least a few hours the\nweight on their shoulders. \n</p><p>\n\tFor the hundredth time that night\nyour eyes searched for the long haired super-soldier. He sat in one\nof the couches on the second floor, you blatantly stared at him,\ntaking advantage of the fact he couldn\u2019t see you. He was <i>beautiful,\n</i>blue eyes shinning even from\nthis distance. His jacket was long gone, sleeves pushed up letting\nhis arm glisten in the low lighting, he\u2019d undone a few more buttons\nof his shirt- your mouth watered at the sight of him. \n</p><p>\n\tBarnes was hot, there was no\ndenying that, but what made your heart stop was when he threw his\nhead back laughing at something Sam said. It was something that was\nbecoming more and more often as the ex-assassin got used to his new\nlife- laughter and happiness taking over the parts of his life that\nwere formerly occupied by screams and oblivion. \n</p><p>\n\tIt was easy to want him, bulging\nmuscles and handsome features. But it was even easier to fall for\nhim, for his mannerisms, his laugh, his compassion, his care.\nEverything he <i>was </i>worked\nlike gravity and you were falling fast.</p><p>\n\tYou bit your lip, pondering your\noptions, you could do something about your feelings now while your\nveins were filled with liquid courage or you could keep loving him\nfrom afar, never knowing what his response would be. Digging the\nphone out of your purse you took a deep breath, fingers shaky. <i><b>I\nneed you. </b></i>\n</p><p>\n\tAs\nyou hit send your brain instantly went haywire, imagining every\nsingle scenario possible. You watched as he pulled out his phone, a\nfrown taking over his features as he typed. <i><b>Are\nyou okay? Did something happen? How can I help?</b></i></p><p>\n<b>\t</b>His\neyes scanned the room, a bit frantic, a deep line forming between his\nbrows. A laugh erupted from your throat. <i>Can\nyou be any more adorable? </i>Well,\nit was now or never. <i><b>No, Buck. I </b></i><i><b>want</b></i><i><b>\nyou</b></i><i><b>. Have wanted you since the day we met.</b></i></p><p>\n<i><b>\t</b></i>Bucky\u2019s\neyes went back to the phone, mouth slightly agape as he read your\nmessage. Again his eyes searched the party, an unreadable expression\non his face. Until his eyes finally found you. It <i>burned\n</i>and\nyou had to look away or you were sure you\u2019d combust.</p><p>\n\tHe\nalmost tripped on his way down the stairs, but he wasn\u2019t headed\ntowards the bar, he went straight to the dance floor, seeking someone\nelse. Thor\u2019s liquor burned on the way down his throat but the\nfeeling was welcomed- he was gonna need it if he intended to have\nthis talk with you.</p><p>\n\tBlue\neyes snapped to the bar, the empty stool making his heart beat out of\ncontrol. \n</p><p>\n~</p><p>\n\t\nThe common area was empty and you threw yourself on the soft couch,\ninstantly regretting it as your drunken body reacted to the harsh\nmotion. Humming in discontent you cursed under your breath. <i>All\nthis time\u2026 all this time you manage to hide your feelings and now\nbecause you can\u2019t hold your liquor you open your mouth. Great job,\nY/N. Wa</i><i>y</i><i>\nto make things weird. </i>\n</p><p>\n<i>\t</i>The\nimage of Bucky descending the stairs and going <i>away</i>\nfrom you replayed in your head, the memory of his unreadable\nexpression dancing in your\nmind.\nYou felt ashamed and foolish, wishing with every part of your being\nthat you could take your words back. Dealing with him never knowing\nwas so much easier then dealing with rejection, and with the\nawkwardness that was bound to settle between the two of you. \n</p><p>\n\tHeels hit the floor at the same\ntime as you buried your face in one of the cushions, longing for it\nto swallow you. <i>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</i>\n\n</p><p>\n\tBucky frantically scanned the\nplace,\nbut you weren\u2019t there. His hands were shaking- even the metal one,\nsomething he didn\u2019t know it could do- and his mouth was dry. The\nother worldly alcohol was slowing him down as he searched- his mind\nseemed to work too fast and his body too slow. Every single scenario\nplayed in his head- it was a prank, you didn\u2019t mean it, you\nregretted it. \tHe went to your room but either you weren\u2019t there or\nyou didn\u2019t want to see him. He\ndidn\u2019t know where else to look or even if you was still on the\ntower. Slightly wobbly legs led him through the corridors, no plan in\nsight, just trying to process all the information as he poorly looked\naround. <i>I\u2019m an idiot, I should have told her sooner. A\nhundred years old and still needing alcohol to talk to a pretty girl.\nNice job, Barnes. </i>\n</p><p>\n<i>\t</i>A strain of muffled curses\nreached his ears. Stopping dead on his track Bucky looked over to the\ncommon area, he couldn\u2019t help the laugh from bubbling up his chest.\nThe dress looked like a mess bundled up around your body-cloth\nflowing to the floor where your heels were thrown. You were face\nfirst on the cushion, hair everywhere, limbs stretched out beside\nyour body. Curses barely\naudible, if it was not for the enhanced hearing he might not have\nheard it.</p><p>\n\tSomething\ninside Bucky\u2019s chest twisted, endearment washing over him,\nhis heart rapidly pumping alcohol dosed blood through his\nveins. He felt nothing but\nlove. And for some reason all that came out in the form of laughter.</p><p>\n\tYou shot up at the sound, almost\nfalling off the couch. The audacity of Bucky Barnes, looking so good\nstanding there, shoulders shaking as he laughed his ass off. For some\nreason you didn\u2019t feel offended, somehow you knew he wasn\u2019t\nlaughing at you, his teary eyes were fixed on you but they conveyed\nsomething much deeper then mirth. \n</p><p>\n\tIf anyone saw that scene they would\nbe sure both of you were crazy, you on the couch clutching your\naching belly and the super soldier on the other side of the room\ntears in his eyes as you guffawed at each other. After several\nminutes you managed to compose yourselves, gazes locked- blue eyes\nnow filled with a mirthful tears and burning with fierce intent. \n</p><p>\n\t\u201cI want you too\u201d His voice was\nlow but the weight of his words hit\nyou like a banshee scream \u201cI think I wanted you before we met.\nHell, I might have longed for you before you were even born,\nwhen Steve was a scrawny punk and I was an idiot looking for love in\nanything that wore a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\n\tHe crossed the room with large\nhurried steps, sitting across from you on the couch. \u201cAnd it only\ntook me months of silent pinning and half a bottle of Thor\u2019s magic\nliquor for me to finally tell you.\u201d You were burning up, a mixture\nof flushed cheeks and pure adoration for men in front of you. \n</p><p>\n\tA teasing smile crossed your lips\n\u201cWho knew drunk Bucky was so\nsappy?\u201d\nHe mocked offence, a hand across his chest. \u201cMe? Sappy?\u201d\nHe practically crawled his\nway to you on the couch, dangerous eyes locked on yours. Your\nmind shot down completely as his arms caged you against the couch,\nlips hovering over yours. \u201cFor you, always.\u201d</p><p>\n\tAnd just like that he kissed you, a\nslow tender kiss that conveyed so much emotion that you almost passed\nout. Everything felt soft and warm and comforting and you never\nwished so hard you didn\u2019t need oxygen. Eventually the kiss stopped,\nBucky leaned his forehead on\nyours, eyes closed and a giant grin on his lips.</p><p>\n\tIt might have been the dizziness of\nthe alcohol or of the kiss, it might have been the way he looked at\nyou or the soft kisses he pressed against your skin, it might have\nbeen the way his hands felt so right around yours or the way he\npoured his heart out to you. But it might have been the fact that it\nwas the simple truth. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love with you\u201d The words\nflowed out your mouth before you could think about it, because you\nonly felt it.</p><p>\n\tMetal fingers cupped your cheek,\nBucky\u2019s eyes were wide and the smile he nurtured grew even bigger.\nHe punctuated his words with\nsoft kisses \u201cI. Love. You.\u201d Maybe it was too soon, but for him it\nwas a lifetime of waiting and he was not going to let\nanother second pass\nwithout letting you know. The\nsmile you gave him was worth\nall the time.</p><p>\n~</p><p>The\nflashing light woke you up with a groan, big arms grew tighter around\nyour body. Slowly you opened your eyes and were met with several\nstares. \u201cAbout time, you two.\u201d Steve\u2019s broad smile was\nblinding, almost as blinding as the flashing of phones as the other\nAvengers took pictures.<br/></p><p>\n\tYou and Bucky had fallen asleep on\nthe couch, still in your\nformal clothes, in each\nothers arms, after several make out sessions. Old blue eyes searched\nyour face a proud smile on his soft plump lips. \u201cFuck off, Steve.\u201d\nWas all he said before\ngrabbing your hand and leading you out of the room.</p><p>\n\tA choir of mocking reprimands to\nBucky\u2019s language could be\nheard from the hallway, both of you laughing while making your\nescape. The laughter died in your throat as Natasha\u2019s high voice\nreached your ears \u201cHey, and don\u2019t forget to use protection!\u201d</p><p>\n\tYour face was burning hot as Bucky\ncame to a halt, turning around to face you a mischievous smirk on his\nhandsome face and a\npromising wink before he\npulled you into his room. \n</p><hr><p>\n\n<b>Thanks for reading!

The low lighting, the\ncandles, the chic d\u00e9cor, the live band- Stark really knew how to\nthrow a party. The faces around the place were familiar- your fellow\nAvenger\u2019s hard to miss, some agents and Stark employees\nacquaintances from missions and day-to-day work, yet the majority of\nthe people were familiar in another way. Faces you\u2019d seen on\nmagazines, billboards, television, movies. Walking into the party you\nsuddenly felt <i>very</i> aware of\neverything, specially everything that regarded yourself.</p><p>\n\tYou had spent hours getting ready\nwith Nat and Wanda, thankfully they were more skilled in knowing how\nto get ready for Tony\u2019s get-togethers, and you were pleasantly\nsurprised by the end result. The gown was beautiful, accentuating\nevery single one of favourite features, the make up and hair more\ntowards the vintage-y side, a look you had always wanted to try but\nnever knew how-thank goodness for witches and super spies.</p><p>\n\tLooking at the faces of models,\nactors, politicians and literal gods your nerves started to get the\nbest of you. Coming to a stop in mere seconds you turned around \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna need alcohol, like, a bucket of it.\u201d Natasha gave you a\nmischievous smile, grabbing your hand and dragging you to the bar.</p><p>\n\tTurns out the Black Widow was quite\nthe bartender and Scarlett Witch really knew how to hold her\nliquor\u2026 and Thor was a douchebag. After a few cocktails you were\nalready feeling tipsy, carefully sat on the high stool, you watched\nas Wanda and Vision danced or rather tried.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\n\t\u201cMy lady, you look lovely\ntonight\u201d A huge frame took the stool besides you and you rolled\nyour eyes at his antics. Thor still wore his signature colours but\ninstead of a cape he now incorporated it to a suit- dark red combo\nwith little golden patterns of what you imagined to be some sort of\nAsgardian runes. \n</p><p>\n\t\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d You\noffered with a small giggle \u201cEnjoying the middle-gardian\u2019s\nfestivities I see.\u201d</p><p>\n\t\u201cMidgardian\u201d</p><p>\n\t\u201cSame difference\u201d \n</p><p>\n\t\u201cAnd yes, I am, but not nearly\ndrunk enough to keep up with Tony\u2019s\u2026 friends.\u201d He eyed the\nbartender ordering drinks as your eyes scanned the room. The spot you\nhad avoided the whole night suddenly catching your attention. \n</p><p>\n\tThe pool table was surrounded by\npeople- man and women with seductive smiles and hunting eyes-\nwatching the people playing. The Bird Clique, Clint and Sam, played\nagainst The American Geriatric Duo, Steve and Bucky. Your smile was\ninstantaneous, the four idiot\u2019s bickering amusing to watch even\nfrom afar. \n</p><p>\n\tBlue eyes focused on you, a smile\nspreading on both your faces. You let your eyes linger on the man for\nthe first time that night: broad shoulders covered by an obscenely\nwell tailored suit, top buttons of his shirt undone, his hair was\nslicked back providing a perfect view of his face as he leaned\nagainst his pool stick. Bucky eyed you with the same curiosity,\nmaking a shiver run down your spine as his eyes came back to yours.\nWith a raised brow and a nod he silently complimented your look.</p><p>\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 can you keep up?\u201d Your\nattention snapped back to the god besides you, Thor looked at you\nwith a defying grin on his lips. Eight shots lined the bar, you\nfrowned, knowing <i>exactly </i>where\nthis was going. \u201cOr are you already running out of <i>midgardian</i>\nstamina? I mean, I can\u2019t blame you, you\u2019re badass but only\nhuman\u2026\u201d</p><p>\n\tYou knocked back four of the\nridiculously strong shots. <i>Jesus, Tony, what the hell even\nis on these? </i>Thor\u2019s thunderous\nlaugh filled the air, taking the little flask from his pocket he\nmixed \u00a0Asgardian liquor into the remaining shots and downed them.</p><p>\n\tAround the room the other Avengers\nwatched the two of you, slightly shaking their heads. \u00a0\n</p><p>\n~</p><p>\n\tA few hours later you were still on\nthe dance floor, amongst some of your teammates and a few strangers.\nInsecurities long gone, taking your filters with it. Deciding to take\na break you walked back to the bar, sipping your water you smiled at\nthe scene: your friends on the dance floor- it was good to see them\nlike this, happy and silly, forgetting for at least a few hours the\nweight on their shoulders. \n</p><p>\n\tFor the hundredth time that night\nyour eyes searched for the long haired super-soldier. He sat in one\nof the couches on the second floor, you blatantly stared at him,\ntaking advantage of the fact he couldn\u2019t see you. He was <i>beautiful,\n</i>blue eyes shinning even from\nthis distance. His jacket was long gone, sleeves pushed up letting\nhis arm glisten in the low lighting, he\u2019d undone a few more buttons\nof his shirt- your mouth watered at the sight of him. \n</p><p>\n\tBarnes was hot, there was no\ndenying that, but what made your heart stop was when he threw his\nhead back laughing at something Sam said. It was something that was\nbecoming more and more often as the ex-assassin got used to his new\nlife- laughter and happiness taking over the parts of his life that\nwere formerly occupied by screams and oblivion. \n</p><p>\n\tIt was easy to want him, bulging\nmuscles and handsome features. But it was even easier to fall for\nhim, for his mannerisms, his laugh, his compassion, his care.\nEverything he <i>was </i>worked\nlike gravity and you were falling fast.</p><p>\n\tYou bit your lip, pondering your\noptions, you could do something about your feelings now while your\nveins were filled with liquid courage or you could keep loving him\nfrom afar, never knowing what his response would be. Digging the\nphone out of your purse you took a deep breath, fingers shaky. <i><b>I\nneed you. </b></i>\n</p><p>\n\tAs\nyou hit send your brain instantly went haywire, imagining every\nsingle scenario possible. You watched as he pulled out his phone, a\nfrown taking over his features as he typed. <i><b>Are\nyou okay? Did something happen?

The low lighting, the\ncandles, the chic d&eacute;cor, the live band- Stark really knew how to\nthrow a party. The faces around the place were familiar- your fellow\nAvenger&rsquo;s hard to miss, some agents and Stark employees\nacquaintances from missions and day-to-day work, yet the majority of\nthe people were familiar in another way. Faces you&rsquo;d seen on\nmagazines, billboards, television, movies. Walking into the party you\nsuddenly felt <i>very</i> aware of\neverything, specially everything that regarded yourself.</p><p>\n\tYou had spent hours getting ready\nwith Nat and Wanda, thankfully they were more skilled in knowing how\nto get ready for Tony&rsquo;s get-togethers, and you were pleasantly\nsurprised by the end result. The gown was beautiful, accentuating\nevery single one of favourite features, the make up and hair more\ntowards the vintage-y side, a look you had always wanted to try but\nnever knew how-thank goodness for witches and super spies.</p><p>\n\tLooking at the faces of models,\nactors, politicians and literal gods your nerves started to get the\nbest of you. Coming to a stop in mere seconds you turned around &ldquo;I&rsquo;m\ngonna need alcohol, like, a bucket of it.&rdquo; Natasha gave you a\nmischievous smile, grabbing your hand and dragging you to the bar.</p><p>\n\tTurns out the Black Widow was quite\nthe bartender and Scarlett Witch really knew how to hold her\nliquor&hellip; and Thor was a douchebag. After a few cocktails you were\nalready feeling tipsy, carefully sat on the high stool, you watched\nas Wanda and Vision danced or rather tried.</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;My lady, you look lovely\ntonight&rdquo; A huge frame took the stool besides you and you rolled\nyour eyes at his antics. Thor still wore his signature colours but\ninstead of a cape he now incorporated it to a suit- dark red combo\nwith little golden patterns of what you imagined to be some sort of\nAsgardian runes. \n</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;Thank you, my lord.&rdquo; You\noffered with a small giggle &ldquo;Enjoying the middle-gardian&rsquo;s\nfestivities I see.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;Midgardian&rdquo;</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;Same difference&rdquo; \n</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;And yes, I am, but not nearly\ndrunk enough to keep up with Tony&rsquo;s&hellip; friends.&rdquo; He eyed the\nbartender ordering drinks as your eyes scanned the room. The spot you\nhad avoided the whole night suddenly catching your attention. \n</p><p>\n\tThe pool table was surrounded by\npeople- man and women with seductive smiles and hunting eyes-\nwatching the people playing. The Bird Clique, Clint and Sam, played\nagainst The American Geriatric Duo, Steve and Bucky. Your smile was\ninstantaneous, the four idiot&rsquo;s bickering amusing to watch even\nfrom afar. \n</p><p>\n\tBlue eyes focused on you, a smile\nspreading on both your faces. You let your eyes linger on the man for\nthe first time that night: broad shoulders covered by an obscenely\nwell tailored suit, top buttons of his shirt undone, his hair was\nslicked back providing a perfect view of his face as he leaned\nagainst his pool stick. Bucky eyed you with the same curiosity,\nmaking a shiver run down your spine as his eyes came back to yours.\nWith a raised brow and a nod he silently complimented your look.</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;So&hellip; can you keep up?&rdquo; Your\nattention snapped back to the god besides you, Thor looked at you\nwith a defying grin on his lips. Eight shots lined the bar, you\nfrowned, knowing <i>exactly </i>where\nthis was going. &ldquo;Or are you already running out of <i>midgardian</i>\nstamina? I mean, I can&rsquo;t blame you, you&rsquo;re badass but only\nhuman&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>\n\tYou knocked back four of the\nridiculously strong shots. <i>Jesus, Tony, what the hell even\nis on these? </i>Thor&rsquo;s thunderous\nlaugh filled the air, taking the little flask from his pocket he\nmixed &nbsp;Asgardian liquor into the remaining shots and downed them.</p><p>\n\tAround the room the other Avengers\nwatched the two of you, slightly shaking their heads. &nbsp;\n</p><p>\n~</p><p>\n\tA few hours later you were still on\nthe dance floor, amongst some of your teammates and a few strangers.\nInsecurities long gone, taking your filters with it. Deciding to take\na break you walked back to the bar, sipping your water you smiled at\nthe scene: your friends on the dance floor- it was good to see them\nlike this, happy and silly, forgetting for at least a few hours the\nweight on their shoulders. \n</p><p>\n\tFor the hundredth time that night\nyour eyes searched for the long haired super-soldier. He sat in one\nof the couches on the second floor, you blatantly stared at him,\ntaking advantage of the fact he couldn&rsquo;t see you. He was <i>beautiful,\n</i>blue eyes shinning even from\nthis distance. His jacket was long gone, sleeves pushed up letting\nhis arm glisten in the low lighting, he&rsquo;d undone a few more buttons\nof his shirt- your mouth watered at the sight of him. \n</p><p>\n\tBarnes was hot, there was no\ndenying that, but what made your heart stop was when he threw his\nhead back laughing at something Sam said. It was something that was\nbecoming more and more often as the ex-assassin got used to his new\nlife- laughter and happiness taking over the parts of his life that\nwere formerly occupied by screams and oblivion. \n</p><p>\n\tIt was easy to want him, bulging\nmuscles and handsome features. But it was even easier to fall for\nhim, for his mannerisms, his laugh, his compassion, his care.\nEverything he <i>was </i>worked\nlike gravity and you were falling fast.</p><p>\n\tYou bit your lip, pondering your\noptions, you could do something about your feelings now while your\nveins were filled with liquid courage or you could keep loving him\nfrom afar, never knowing what his response would be. Digging the\nphone out of your purse you took a deep breath, fingers shaky. <i><b>I\nneed you. </b></i>\n</p><p>\n\tAs\nyou hit send your brain instantly went haywire, imagining every\nsingle scenario possible. You watched as he pulled out his phone, a\nfrown taking over his features as he typed. <i><b>Are\nyou okay? Did something happen? How can I help?</b></i></p><p>\n<b>\t</b>His\neyes scanned the room, a bit frantic, a deep line forming between his\nbrows. A laugh erupted from your throat. <i>Can\nyou be any more adorable? </i>Well,\nit was now or never. <i><b>No, Buck. I </b></i><i><b>want</b></i><i><b>\nyou</b></i><i><b>. Have wanted you since the day we met.</b></i></p><p>\n<i><b>\t</b></i>Bucky&rsquo;s\neyes went back to the phone, mouth slightly agape as he read your\nmessage. Again his eyes searched the party, an unreadable expression\non his face. Until his eyes finally found you. It <i>burned\n</i>and\nyou had to look away or you were sure you&rsquo;d combust.</p><p>\n\tHe\nalmost tripped on his way down the stairs, but he wasn&rsquo;t headed\ntowards the bar, he went straight to the dance floor, seeking someone\nelse. Thor&rsquo;s liquor burned on the way down his throat but the\nfeeling was welcomed- he was gonna need it if he intended to have\nthis talk with you.</p><p>\n\tBlue\neyes snapped to the bar, the empty stool making his heart beat out of\ncontrol. \n</p><p>\n~</p><p>\n\t\nThe common area was empty and you threw yourself on the soft couch,\ninstantly regretting it as your drunken body reacted to the harsh\nmotion. Humming in discontent you cursed under your breath. <i>All\nthis time&hellip; all this time you manage to hide your feelings and now\nbecause you can&rsquo;t hold your liquor you open your mouth. Great job,\nY/N. Wa</i><i>y</i><i>\nto make things weird. </i>\n</p><p>\n<i>\t</i>The\nimage of Bucky descending the stairs and going <i>away</i>\nfrom you replayed in your head, the memory of his unreadable\nexpression dancing in your\nmind.\nYou felt ashamed and foolish, wishing with every part of your being\nthat you could take your words back. Dealing with him never knowing\nwas so much easier then dealing with rejection, and with the\nawkwardness that was bound to settle between the two of you. \n</p><p>\n\tHeels hit the floor at the same\ntime as you buried your face in one of the cushions, longing for it\nto swallow you. <i>Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</i>\n\n</p><p>\n\tBucky frantically scanned the\nplace,\nbut you weren&rsquo;t there. His hands were shaking- even the metal one,\nsomething he didn&rsquo;t know it could do- and his mouth was dry. The\nother worldly alcohol was slowing him down as he searched- his mind\nseemed to work too fast and his body too slow. Every single scenario\nplayed in his head- it was a prank, you didn&rsquo;t mean it, you\nregretted it. \tHe went to your room but either you weren&rsquo;t there or\nyou didn&rsquo;t want to see him. He\ndidn&rsquo;t know where else to look or even if you was still on the\ntower. Slightly wobbly legs led him through the corridors, no plan in\nsight, just trying to process all the information as he poorly looked\naround. <i>I&rsquo;m an idiot, I should have told her sooner. A\nhundred years old and still needing alcohol to talk to a pretty girl.\nNice job, Barnes. </i>\n</p><p>\n<i>\t</i>A strain of muffled curses\nreached his ears. Stopping dead on his track Bucky looked over to the\ncommon area, he couldn&rsquo;t help the laugh from bubbling up his chest.\nThe dress looked like a mess bundled up around your body-cloth\nflowing to the floor where your heels were thrown. You were face\nfirst on the cushion, hair everywhere, limbs stretched out beside\nyour body. Curses barely\naudible, if it was not for the enhanced hearing he might not have\nheard it.</p><p>\n\tSomething\ninside Bucky&rsquo;s chest twisted, endearment washing over him,\nhis heart rapidly pumping alcohol dosed blood through his\nveins. He felt nothing but\nlove. And for some reason all that came out in the form of laughter.</p><p>\n\tYou shot up at the sound, almost\nfalling off the couch. The audacity of Bucky Barnes, looking so good\nstanding there, shoulders shaking as he laughed his ass off. For some\nreason you didn&rsquo;t feel offended, somehow you knew he wasn&rsquo;t\nlaughing at you, his teary eyes were fixed on you but they conveyed\nsomething much deeper then mirth. \n</p><p>\n\tIf anyone saw that scene they would\nbe sure both of you were crazy, you on the couch clutching your\naching belly and the super soldier on the other side of the room\ntears in his eyes as you guffawed at each other. After several\nminutes you managed to compose yourselves, gazes locked- blue eyes\nnow filled with a mirthful tears and burning with fierce intent. \n</p><p>\n\t&ldquo;I want you too&rdquo; His voice was\nlow but the weight of his words hit\nyou like a banshee scream &ldquo;I think I wanted you before we met.\nHell, I might have longed for you before you were even born,\nwhen Steve was a scrawny punk and I was an idiot looking for love in\nanything that wore a skirt.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\tHe crossed the room with large\nhurried steps, sitting across from you on the couch. &ldquo;And it only\ntook me months of silent pinning and half a bottle of Thor&rsquo;s magic\nliquor for me to finally tell you.&rdquo; You were burning up, a mixture\nof flushed cheeks and pure adoration for men in front of you. \n</p><p>\n\tA teasing smile crossed your lips\n&ldquo;Who knew drunk Bucky was so\nsappy?&rdquo;\nHe mocked offence, a hand across his chest. &ldquo;Me? Sappy?&rdquo;\nHe practically crawled his\nway to you on the couch, dangerous eyes locked on yours. Your\nmind shot down completely as his arms caged you against the couch,\nlips hovering over yours. &ldquo;For you, always.&rdquo;</p><p>\n\tAnd just like that he kissed you, a\nslow tender kiss that conveyed so much emotion that you almost passed\nout. Everything felt soft and warm and comforting and you never\nwished so hard you didn&rsquo;t need oxygen. Eventually the kiss stopped,\nBucky leaned his forehead on\nyours, eyes closed and a giant grin on his lips.</p><p>\n\tIt might have been the dizziness of\nthe alcohol or of the kiss, it might have been the way he looked at\nyou or the soft kisses he pressed against your skin, it might have\nbeen the way his hands felt so right around yours or the way he\npoured his heart out to you. But it might have been the fact that it\nwas the simple truth. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m in love with you&rdquo; The words\nflowed out your mouth before you could think about it, because you\nonly felt it.</p><p>\n\tMetal fingers cupped your cheek,\nBucky&rsquo;s eyes were wide and the smile he nurtured grew even bigger.\nHe punctuated his words with\nsoft kisses &ldquo;I. Love. You.&rdquo; Maybe it was too soon, but for him it\nwas a lifetime of waiting and he was not going to let\nanother second pass\nwithout letting you know. The\nsmile you gave him was worth\nall the time.</p><p>\n~</p><p>The\nflashing light woke you up with a groan, big arms grew tighter around\nyour body. Slowly you opened your eyes and were met with several\nstares. &ldquo;About time, you two.&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s broad smile was\nblinding, almost as blinding as the flashing of phones as the other\nAvengers took pictures.<br /></p><p>\n\tYou and Bucky had fallen asleep on\nthe couch, still in your\nformal clothes, in each\nothers arms, after several make out sessions.
