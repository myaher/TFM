Peter didn&rsquo;t notice the figure running towards his tower until it was to late.</p><p>The Girl fell face forward the brown satchel slipped from her hands as Peter let out a cry hiding behind a mannequin, Peter peeped over the top of the mannequin then using it to shield himself as he moved forward to the body.Peter winced as he drew the frying pan once more prodding the girls head flinching back as if to see if the girl moved, nothing happened peter looked to MJ with a confused expression to chameleon was just as confused replying with a simple shrug. Peter looked back at the body his frying pan was still ready to THWACK again he stepped forward nudging the girls head revealing part of her face he took a moment to look at her features then looked to MJ, who in return went to the exaggerated portrait of a thug peters mother drew only moments before mimicking the red colour and miming pointy teeth. Peter flipped the pan around using the handle to push the girls top lip to reveal normal white teeth, peter Gasped he then flipped her hair from her face to show the most beautiful girl Peter had ever seen that wasn&rsquo;t a portrait in a book. He moved in closer admiring her beauty when a bright (Eye Colour) Eye peered back at him in one split second Peter hit the Girl again in fear.</p><!-- more --><p>Peter had to do something about the girl he couldn&rsquo;t just leave her there on the floor for his mother to find, peter paced around looking for places to hide a body his long hair flowing behind him \u201cAh HA i got it MJ i\u2019ll hide her in here\u201d he exclaimed wrapping his hair around the girl and using his strength to pull her towards the Wardrobe (Closet). \u201cokay here goes\u201d he huffed pulling the girl up letting her limp body flop on him as he used a web to pull open the door, \u201cjeez i never knew a girl could weigh so much\u201d peter huffed \u201cokay in you go\u201d peter moved quickly so that the girl would flop into the wardrobe but she infarct missed. this time peter aimed his web shooter to a high beam in the tower wrapping his hair around the girl again he swung dropping Flynn into the wardrobe the force closing the doors tight \u201cYEs\u201d peter cheered dropping in front to pull his hair from the closet \u201coh no, no, no don\u2019t be stuck OH COME ON !\u201d peter face planted the door grumbling nonsense as he opened the doors again The body flopping out instantly. he took a few steps back thinking of a solution.</p><p>His next attempt seemed flawless push the body up quickly close the doors but no the girl flopped out once more, \u201cOkay this time will indefinably work\u201d peter thought he grabbed a nearby broom lifting the girl up and pushing her in and slamming the doors on her hand \u201couch\u201d peter winched as he poked the hand back in pushing a chair up to stop her flopping out again.</p><p>\u201cokay, okay, I have a person in My Closet, I&rsquo;ve got a person in my closet,\u201d peter started still not believing himself as he spoke to his reflection \u201cI have a Person in My closet!!

Well tell that to my Frying pan\u201d \u00a0</p><p>BONK !</p><p>\u201chuh?\u201d peter rubbed his head where he hit it with the frying pan noticing a shiny object in the satchel the girl dropped, he walked towards it picking up the object admiring the bright blue crystals and gold rim, he scrunched his face trying to figure out what it was. He held out his pinky finger sliding the crown on as if it were one of his mothers hideous rings looking at MJ to see her opinion, She only shook her head. Peter held the crown closer to his face closing one eye as if he was using one of the many magnifying glasses looking at MJ again who only shook her head. Frustrated peter turned to the mirror again looking at his reflection he looked at the crown in his hands and deciding to place it upon his head staring at his reflection his hazel eyes wide with curiosity- </p><p>\u201cOh Peter!!\u201d Gothel cried from the bottom of the tower snapping peter from his trance, he stated rushing around putting the crown into a pot and heading to the window. \u00a0\u201cwould you let down that rope\u201d</p><p>\u201cone moment mother\u201d peter shouted down as he hooked the rope around the window hook letting it drop to the ground.</p><p>\u201ci have a big surprise!\u201d Gothel shouted upwards with delight as she grabbed the rope</p><p>\u201cuh, i Do too\u201d</p><p> \u201cOh i bet my surprise is bigger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously doubt it\u201d peter mumbled pulling the rope, Mother Gothel appearing at the window beaming</p><p>\u201ci brought back parsnips. i&rsquo;m going to make hazelnut soup for dinner, your favourite.

Peter looked around the room his sight settling on his new painting of the lights then back to wardrobe he sighed \u201call i was going to say, mother is that i know what i want for my birthday, now.\u201d peter warped his arms around him in a hug smiling </p><p>\u201cand what is that?\u201d </p><p>\u201cnew paint.

He held out his pinky finger sliding the crown on as if it were one of his mothers hideous rings looking at MJ to see her opinion, She only shook her head. Peter held the crown closer to his face closing one eye as if he was using one of the many magnifying glasses looking at MJ again who only shook her head.

The names Flynn Ryder, how&rsquo;s your day going,huh?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter looked confused at the confidence Flynn had he huffed &ldquo;Who else knows my location, FLynN RyDer?&rdquo; he spoke pointing the pan back at Flynn.</p><p>&ldquo;All right Blondie-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peter&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Guzuntight, here&rsquo;s the deal, I was in a situation, Gallivanting through the forest, i came across your tower and&rdquo; sudden realization hit Flynn &ldquo;oh no where is my satchel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hidden it, somewhere you&rsquo;ll never find it.&rdquo; peter bluffed but Flynn didn&rsquo;t buy it as she scanned the tower her eyes landing on a ceramic pot &nbsp;&ldquo;its in that pot,isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p><p>THWACK</p><p>Flynn woke again to MJ&rsquo;s tongue in her ear again she look at the lizard before screaming &ldquo;Will you stop that!&rdquo; rubbing the side of her head on her shoulder </p><p>&ldquo;Now its hidden where you&rsquo;ll never find it&rdquo; peter smirked waving his hair behind him he stated to pace around Flynn &ldquo;So, what do you want, with my hair? To cut it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sell it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No! Listen, the only thing i want to do with your hair, which is a very large amount for a guy like you is get out of it. Literally!! And what&rsquo;s with this other stuff, and please tell me it didn&rsquo;t come out of you&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What!? No i made it it&rsquo;s like spiders webs and glue&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right your like the king you make things cool cool cool cool no doubt no doubt&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait, you don&rsquo;t want my hair?&rdquo; Peter was confused his mother told him that his hair would be the only reason anyone would want to hurt him</p><p>&ldquo;Why on earth would i want your hair?&rdquo; Flynn was even more confused why would anyone come to steal someone&rsquo;s hair &ldquo;Look, i was being chased, i saw a tower, i climbed it, end of story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling the truth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hummm&rdquo; Peter ran everything though his head as Mj popped up once more running down his arm to the end of the frying pan, she stared flynn down as peter moved her away growling.Flynn just looked confused.</p><p>MJ started to squeal and squeak as if she was talking to peter &ldquo;i know, i need someone to take me.&rdquo; peter began &nbsp;earning a few more squeaks &ldquo;i think she&rsquo;s telling the truth, too.&rdquo; more questioning squeaks &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have fangs, but what choice do i have?&rdquo;.</p><p>Flynn peerd round concern played on her face as she started to bounce on the chair to move peter sighed &ldquo;oh okay Flynn Ryder, I&rsquo;m Prepared to offer you a deal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Deal?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look this way&rdquo; peter pulled his hair making the chair spin losing its balance making Flynn fall face first &ldquo;oof&rdquo; Peter on the other hand climbed on top of the fireplace pulling the curtain back on his new masterpiece &ldquo;Do you know what these are?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You mean the lantern thing they do for the Prince?&rdquo; she spoke face squashed against the floor</p><p>&ldquo;Lanterns&hellip;.i knew they weren&rsquo;t stars. Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky,with these lanterns. You, will act as my guide take me to these lanterns and return me home safely Then and only then, will i return your satchel to you that is my deal&rdquo;</p><p>FLynn smiled at how ridiculous this guy was being as she tried to roll over &ldquo;yeah, no can do, unfortunately, the kingdom and i aren&rsquo;t exactly, &lsquo;Simpatico&rsquo; at the moment so i won&rsquo;t be taking you anywhere&rdquo;</p><p>Peter raised an eyebrow and looked at MJ who motioned to whoop Flynn&rsquo;s ass, he jumped down from the mantle and pulled his hair in turn FLynns chair lifted up &ldquo;something brought you here, FlYNn RyDEr, call it what you will Fate, Destiny.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A horse&rdquo; she deadpanned</p><p>&ldquo;So i have made the decision to trust you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A horrible Decision, Really.&rdquo; she mumbled </p><p>&ldquo;But trust me, when i tell you this&rdquo; peter moved in closer so he was face to face with the girl &ldquo;you can tear this tower apart, brick by brick but without my help you will never find your precious satchel.&rdquo; Flynn gulped &ldquo;LEt me just get this straight, i Take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home and you&rsquo;ll give me back my satchel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I Promise&rdquo; Flynn only raised her eyebrow at him &ldquo;And when i Promise something, i never Ever break that Promise EVER!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alright, listen, i didn&rsquo;t want to have to do this but you leave me no choice Here comes the &lsquo;Smolder&rsquo;&rdquo; Flynn tried to pull a sexy face but peter didn&rsquo;t buy it he just looked at her with pure determination &ldquo;this is kind of an off day for me. This doesn&rsquo;t normally happen&hellip; FINE! I&rsquo;ll take you to see the lanterns&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;REALLY!!&rdquo; Peter exclaimed letting go of the chair Flynn slammed face first once more into the floor &ldquo;oops&rdquo; &ldquo;i think you broke my face&rdquo;</p><p>__________________<br /></p><p><b>Tags - Tag list is still open&nbsp;</b></p><p><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m3CX9BzzOAoQyJ9IhM18kzQ\">@beautiful-holland</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mVude2pFQfS8vTACF86yUGQ\">@yikesmcdonald</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLxHkBOkA5qBAHdzsMmSPcQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLxHkBOkA5qBAHdzsMmSPcQ\">@greenarrowhead</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/msrO4TweMKVGo4q4irPtOAg\">@shamelessbookaddict</a><br /></p>",

Peter didn&rsquo;t notice the figure running towards his tower until it was to late.</p>\n<p>The Girl fell face forward the brown satchel slipped from her hands as Peter let out a cry hiding behind a mannequin, Peter peeped over the top of the mannequin then using it to shield himself as he moved forward to the body.Peter winced as he drew the frying pan once more prodding the girls head flinching back as if to see if the girl moved, nothing happened peter looked to MJ with a confused expression to chameleon was just as confused replying with a simple shrug. Peter looked back at the body his frying pan was still ready to THWACK again he stepped forward nudging the girls head revealing part of her face he took a moment to look at her features then looked to MJ, who in return went to the exaggerated portrait of a thug peters mother drew only moments before mimicking the red colour and miming pointy teeth. Peter flipped the pan around using the handle to push the girls top lip to reveal normal white teeth, peter Gasped he then flipped her hair from her face to show the most beautiful girl Peter had ever seen that wasn&rsquo;t a portrait in a book. He moved in closer admiring her beauty when a bright (Eye Colour) Eye peered back at him in one split second Peter hit the Girl again in fear.</p>\n</p>",

And it was illegal but I was on your wifi that Friday runs so the virus went into her system and now I\u2019m getting a bunch of panicked texts from Ned. Oh my god, Mr. Stark!

The virus was pretty standard, it was just that it was connected to Friday that it had such a large scale effect. Only Peter would download a movie illegally when he was in possibly the most expensive building in the country. </p><p><br/></p><p>Okay this is less than 1k, but I\u2019ve been lacking inspiration and this was all I could come up with that I liked :))) This is for <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mqJbz4yGocYJCWtO7oRGa5A\">@iron-man-bingo</a> and will likely be the only one I get done on time, but I plan on writing more based on the prompts I got!</p>",
