You couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being cooped up with Cersei in\nthe wheelhouse for a month. However, your brothers had made it their mission to\nconvince you to join them. Not that it took much. You would do anything for\nyour brothers and they knew it. That was the only reason you were stepping out\nof the wheelhouse in front of the Lord and Lady of Winterfell.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\ngreeted them as their station demanded, but your eyes kept flickering back to\nthe dark-eyed young man behind them. You didn\u2019t have to be a genius to know who\nhe was. Everyone knew of Jon Snow, Ned Stark\u2019s one indiscretion in his\notherwise honorable life. One look at the young man and you\u2019d swear he was all\nStark. Those deep, dark eyes were paired with hair just as dark and the curls\nhe had were similar to his brother Robb\u2019s. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nflashed Jon a smile as you were ushered away to prepare for the feast that\nnight. That was yet another event you had no desire to go to. Luckily, after you\nmade an appearance, you would most likely be able to sneak away without\nattracting attention. That\u2019s exactly what you did too. As soon as you had\nfinished eating, you managed to find your way outside and breathed a sigh of\nrelief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I\nshould have known you\u2019d find a way to join us soon or later, Y/N.\u201c You\ngrinned at the sound of your brother\u2019s voice. &ldquo;Yes well, you know the\nparties Robert and Cersei life don\u2019t suit my fancy.\u201d You turned your eyes\nto Jon. He grew uncomfortable under your gaze after a moment. You looked back\nto Tyrion. \u201cPlease tell me you have wine.\u201d Tyrion chuckled and handed\nhis wineskin to you. \u201cThank you.\u201d Jon was quiet, but his eyes never\nleft you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Are\nyou nervous, Jon Snow?\u201c you asked as you took a swig of your brother\u2019s\nwine. Jon shook his head. &quot;No, my lady. It\u2019s just\u2026you shouldn\u2019t be out\nhere with me. You should be inside with the rest of your family and the\nStarks.\u201d You rolled your eyes. \u201cPlease, Y/N will do. I only use my\ntitle when I need something desperately. Besides, maybe I\u2019d like to stay out\nhere with you and Tyrion. Join us for a drink, Snow.\u201d Jon looked reluctant\nat first, but nodded slowly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nspent the rest of the evening with the two men, drinking and talking. Jon grew\nmore talkative as he drank, but he never got drunk, not like Tyrion. Tyrion\nended up passing out, leaving you and Jon to stay and get to know one another.\nYou found that you really like the young man. He was loyal and honorable and\nsometimes funny. He had very little pride in himself though. He believed the\nonly way he was worth anything was to join the Night\u2019s Watch. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spending\ntime with Jon became your favorite part of being in Winterfell. And you spent a\nlot of time with him. You just couldn\u2019t seem to help it. Tyrion, of course,\nencouraged it. He had a fondness for bastards, cripples, and broken things.\nOver the course of your stay, Jon seemed to open up more too and you found\nyourself enjoying his company much more than anyone else\u2019s. Your affection for\nhim grew by the day, so when the day came for you to leave, you were\nheartbroken. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I\nhope to see you again one day, Jon. I know it isn\u2019t likely since you\u2019ll be\ngoing to the Wall, but perhaps I could write now and again,\u201c you told him.\nHe gave you a small smile. &quot;I\u2019d like that.\u201d The two of you stood\nthere staring at each other for a moment until someone cleared their throat.\n\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Tyrion asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon\nnodded and, after Tyrion walked away, he leaned in and \u00a0kissed your cheek. \u201cGoodbye, my\nlady.\u201d You were grateful no one else was around to see that or you might\nhave melted as you whispered goodbye. You couldn\u2019t stop your tears, however, as\nyou climbed into the wheelhouse with your sister. You had no idea if you\u2019d ever\nsee Jon again. You only hoped the gods were on your side. </p><p><b>*many\nyears later*</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your\nheart skipped a beat when you heard his name. You stood next to Daenerys as\nVarys finished reading the letter. \u201cSigned, Jon Snow, King in the\nNorth.\u201d You had to fight back a gasp. Jon was alive and he was coming to\nDragonstone! You could have jumped for joy.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\nhad been years since you last saw him. Many people had come and gone from your\nlife in that time, but you\u2019d never felt as close to them as you had to Jon. In\nall this time, your affections for him never lessened much to your surprise.\nYou had expected your feelings to fade but they had only grown stronger as was\nevident by how your heart lurched whenever his name was mentioned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What\ndo you know about this Jon Snow?\u201c Daenerys asked Tyrion. Tyrion\u2019s eyes\nshifted to you for a moment before he answered her. You tuned out what he was\nsaying since you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Jon. &quot;And you, Lady Y/N?\nWhat is your impression of Jon Snow?\u201d You jumped at the sound of your\nname. You bit your lip, trying to find the right words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;My\nsister is in love with him and has been for years.\u201c You hissed his name in\nwarning while Daenerys watched on in amusement. &quot;I see. And does he return\nyour affections?\u201d Your brows furrowed. You had no idea. Neither of you had\nadmitted to any feelings the last you saw him. What if he didn\u2019t love you? Or\nworse, what if he did but when he did arrive in Dragonstone he fell for\nDaenerys\u2019 charms? Men seemed to fall in love with her at the drop of a hat.\nOnly time would tell.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nwere on pins and needles a few weeks later when it was announced that Jon had\nfinally sailed in. You waited in Daenerys\u2019 throne room with the Dragon Queen\nand your brother. It was deadly quiet and you had to stifle a gasp when you saw\nJon. He looked the same and yet completely different. Gone were the boyish\nlooks and, in their place, the ruggedness of a man who had seen and heard too much.\nHis dark locks were pulled back to get them out of his face, which had a couple\nof scars added to it. His eyes were the same though and when they met yours, it\nwas if time stood still. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While\nintroductions were made, you and Jon simply stared at one another, speechless.\nEverything you had been feeling for him was magnified when you set eyes on him.\nYour heart picked up speed and you found it difficult to breathe without\nsighing his name. You missed the looks Daenerys kept giving you and Jon and you\nhad to praise Jon for his ability to hold a conversation during this moment.\nMaybe he wasn\u2019t as affected as you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After\nwhat seemed like an eternity, Daenerys finally left the room with Tyrion and\nVarys at her side. That left you, Jon, and the older gentleman that was\nintroduced as Ser Davos. The latter cleared his throat and mumbled something\nabout letting the crew know they\u2019d be staying for a while as he shuffled from\nthe room. It was just you and Jon now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N,\u201c\nhe whispered at the same time you said his name. You laughed softly as he\nsmiled at you. &quot;I\u2019ve missed you, Jon. There\u2019s so much I need to tell\nyou.\u201d You took a step closer to him, hand outstretched. You heart had yet\nto calm and it only pounded more violently as Jon took your hand in his. You\nswore he could hear it as his dark eyes pierced your (e/c) ones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I\nmissed you too, Y/N.\u201c You beamed and moved to take his arm. &quot;Then we\nmust catch up!\u201d You practically dragged him from the room and toward your\nown chambers where you spent the rest of the night and well into the morning\ntalking. \u201cThey really did that to you? For doing what you thought was\nright?\u201d you asked. Jon nodded solemnly. You could tell it was hard for him\nto talk about his \u201cdeath\u201d and you mentally made a note to thank the\nRed Woman for bringing him back to you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You\nknow, it was thinking of you that kept me going when I wanted to quit,\u201c he\nadmitted softly, &quot;There were times when Alliser Thorne was so harsh and,\nwhen I wasn\u2019t picked to be a Ranger, and when Father died that I wanted to\nleave and never go back. But I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you. I didn\u2019t want to\nchange your opinion of me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Jon,\nnothing could change my opinion of you. I love you too much and for too long to\nlet that happen.\u201c You didn\u2019t even realize what you\u2019d said until Jon\u2019s\nmouth dropped open. &quot;What?\u201d you asked. \u201cYou said you love\nme,\u201d he replied softly. You stiffened. You had, hadn\u2019t you? \u201cI-I,\u201d\nyou started, trying to think of a way to save yourself from further\nembarrassment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon\u2019s\nhand came to rest on top of yours and he moved to sit beside you. \u201cI love\nyou too, Y/N. I have since the day you bested Theon in archery. I will never\nforget the look of pure surprise on your face even though you were the one to\nchallenge him. You looked so beautiful and I knew I would love you\nforever.\u201d You giggled slightly at the memory as you leaned over to rest\nyour head on Jon\u2019s shoulder. You stayed that way, swapping memories and stories\nuntil you drifted off to couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open any longer. Jon was with\nyou and you felt safe, happy, and most importantly, loved.</p><p>\u00a0(a/n: Once again, I\u2019d like to be able to find good Jon gifs WITHOUT Dany too. Kinda ruins the whole reader insert vibe sometimes. I\u2019d make them if I knew how XD. Anyway, I hope you lovelies like it!)</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUcOAuHFkajk7LWhq0FodHw\">@brewsthespirit-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOcznulOLsvbcxlR9zBLW7g\">@ghostie-writes</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB9lZLG-0miZod2nY_CvJFQ\">@line-viper</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiY2oSh-axyAA8AHdpth3Q\">@etherealpotter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrjt96d-IzaKnGUzhdCZMg\">@littlemisscaptainfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPf4F6x7gfblkMJJEWgcYfQ\">@frozenhuntress67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMRXgAmVmOVU5evD7qT1zKQ\">@cd1242</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjPe2BSEOOuoR04SR65K-eQ\">@gruffle1</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muQ8RCEoiFlaliSH-RAoMFw\">@smalltownbigheart</a></p>",

You couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being cooped up with Cersei in\nthe wheelhouse for a month. However, your brothers had made it their mission to\nconvince you to join them. Not that it took much. You would do anything for\nyour brothers and they knew it. That was the only reason you were stepping out\nof the wheelhouse in front of the Lord and Lady of Winterfell.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\ngreeted them as their station demanded, but your eyes kept flickering back to\nthe dark-eyed young man behind them. You didn\u2019t have to be a genius to know who\nhe was. Everyone knew of Jon Snow, Ned Stark\u2019s one indiscretion in his\notherwise honorable life. One look at the young man and you\u2019d swear he was all\nStark. Those deep, dark eyes were paired with hair just as dark and the curls\nhe had were similar to his brother Robb\u2019s. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nflashed Jon a smile as you were ushered away to prepare for the feast that\nnight. That was yet another event you had no desire to go to. Luckily, after you\nmade an appearance, you would most likely be able to sneak away without\nattracting attention. That\u2019s exactly what you did too. As soon as you had\nfinished eating, you managed to find your way outside and breathed a sigh of\nrelief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\nshould have known you\u2019d find a way to join us soon or later, Y/N.\u201c You\ngrinned at the sound of your brother\u2019s voice. \u201cYes well, you know the\nparties Robert and Cersei life don\u2019t suit my fancy.\u201d You turned your eyes\nto Jon. He grew uncomfortable under your gaze after a moment. You looked back\nto Tyrion. \u201cPlease tell me you have wine.\u201d Tyrion chuckled and handed\nhis wineskin to you. \u201cThank you.\u201d Jon was quiet, but his eyes never\nleft you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are\nyou nervous, Jon Snow?\u201c you asked as you took a swig of your brother\u2019s\nwine. Jon shook his head. \"No, my lady. It\u2019s just\u2026you shouldn\u2019t be out\nhere with me. You should be inside with the rest of your family and the\nStarks.\u201d You rolled your eyes. \u201cPlease, Y/N will do. I only use my\ntitle when I need something desperately. Besides, maybe I\u2019d like to stay out\nhere with you and Tyrion. Join us for a drink, Snow.\u201d Jon looked reluctant\nat first, but nodded slowly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nspent the rest of the evening with the two men, drinking and talking. Jon grew\nmore talkative as he drank, but he never got drunk, not like Tyrion. Tyrion\nended up passing out, leaving you and Jon to stay and get to know one another.\nYou found that you really like the young man. He was loyal and honorable and\nsometimes funny. He had very little pride in himself though. He believed the\nonly way he was worth anything was to join the Night\u2019s Watch. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spending\ntime with Jon became your favorite part of being in Winterfell. And you spent a\nlot of time with him. You just couldn\u2019t seem to help it. Tyrion, of course,\nencouraged it. He had a fondness for bastards, cripples, and broken things.\nOver the course of your stay, Jon seemed to open up more too and you found\nyourself enjoying his company much more than anyone else\u2019s. Your affection for\nhim grew by the day, so when the day came for you to leave, you were\nheartbroken. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\nhope to see you again one day, Jon. I know it isn\u2019t likely since you\u2019ll be\ngoing to the Wall, but perhaps I could write now and again,\u201c you told him.\nHe gave you a small smile. \"I\u2019d like that.\u201d The two of you stood\nthere staring at each other for a moment until someone cleared their throat.\n\u201cAre we ready?\u201d Tyrion asked. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon\nnodded and, after Tyrion walked away, he leaned in and \u00a0kissed your cheek. \u201cGoodbye, my\nlady.\u201d You were grateful no one else was around to see that or you might\nhave melted as you whispered goodbye. You couldn\u2019t stop your tears, however, as\nyou climbed into the wheelhouse with your sister. You had no idea if you\u2019d ever\nsee Jon again. You only hoped the gods were on your side. </p><p><b>*many\nyears later*</b></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your\nheart skipped a beat when you heard his name. You stood next to Daenerys as\nVarys finished reading the letter. \u201cSigned, Jon Snow, King in the\nNorth.\u201d You had to fight back a gasp. Jon was alive and he was coming to\nDragonstone! You could have jumped for joy.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\nhad been years since you last saw him. Many people had come and gone from your\nlife in that time, but you\u2019d never felt as close to them as you had to Jon. In\nall this time, your affections for him never lessened much to your surprise.\nYou had expected your feelings to fade but they had only grown stronger as was\nevident by how your heart lurched whenever his name was mentioned. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What\ndo you know about this Jon Snow?\u201c Daenerys asked Tyrion. Tyrion\u2019s eyes\nshifted to you for a moment before he answered her. You tuned out what he was\nsaying since you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Jon. \"And you, Lady Y/N?\nWhat is your impression of Jon Snow?\u201d You jumped at the sound of your\nname. You bit your lip, trying to find the right words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My\nsister is in love with him and has been for years.\u201c You hissed his name in\nwarning while Daenerys watched on in amusement. \"I see. And does he return\nyour affections?\u201d Your brows furrowed. You had no idea. Neither of you had\nadmitted to any feelings the last you saw him. What if he didn\u2019t love you? Or\nworse, what if he did but when he did arrive in Dragonstone he fell for\nDaenerys\u2019 charms? Men seemed to fall in love with her at the drop of a hat.\nOnly time would tell.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\nwere on pins and needles a few weeks later when it was announced that Jon had\nfinally sailed in. You waited in Daenerys\u2019 throne room with the Dragon Queen\nand your brother. It was deadly quiet and you had to stifle a gasp when you saw\nJon. He looked the same and yet completely different. Gone were the boyish\nlooks and, in their place, the ruggedness of a man who had seen and heard too much.\nHis dark locks were pulled back to get them out of his face, which had a couple\nof scars added to it. His eyes were the same though and when they met yours, it\nwas if time stood still. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While\nintroductions were made, you and Jon simply stared at one another, speechless.\nEverything you had been feeling for him was magnified when you set eyes on him.\nYour heart picked up speed and you found it difficult to breathe without\nsighing his name. You missed the looks Daenerys kept giving you and Jon and you\nhad to praise Jon for his ability to hold a conversation during this moment.\nMaybe he wasn\u2019t as affected as you. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After\nwhat seemed like an eternity, Daenerys finally left the room with Tyrion and\nVarys at her side. That left you, Jon, and the older gentleman that was\nintroduced as Ser Davos. The latter cleared his throat and mumbled something\nabout letting the crew know they\u2019d be staying for a while as he shuffled from\nthe room. It was just you and Jon now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N,\u201c\nhe whispered at the same time you said his name. You laughed softly as he\nsmiled at you. \"I\u2019ve missed you, Jon. There\u2019s so much I need to tell\nyou.\u201d You took a step closer to him, hand outstretched. You heart had yet\nto calm and it only pounded more violently as Jon took your hand in his. You\nswore he could hear it as his dark eyes pierced your (e/c) ones. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\nmissed you too, Y/N.\u201c You beamed and moved to take his arm. \"Then we\nmust catch up!\u201d You practically dragged him from the room and toward your\nown chambers where you spent the rest of the night and well into the morning\ntalking. \u201cThey really did that to you? For doing what you thought was\nright?\u201d you asked. Jon nodded solemnly. You could tell it was hard for him\nto talk about his \u201cdeath\u201d and you mentally made a note to thank the\nRed Woman for bringing him back to you.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\nknow, it was thinking of you that kept me going when I wanted to quit,\u201c he\nadmitted softly, \"There were times when Alliser Thorne was so harsh and,\nwhen I wasn\u2019t picked to be a Ranger, and when Father died that I wanted to\nleave and never go back. But I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you. I didn\u2019t want to\nchange your opinion of me.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Jon,\nnothing could change my opinion of you. I love you too much and for too long to\nlet that happen.\u201c You didn\u2019t even realize what you\u2019d said until Jon\u2019s\nmouth dropped open. \"What?\u201d you asked. \u201cYou said you love\nme,\u201d he replied softly. You stiffened. You had, hadn\u2019t you? \u201cI-I,\u201d\nyou started, trying to think of a way to save yourself from further\nembarrassment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jon\u2019s\nhand came to rest on top of yours and he moved to sit beside you. \u201cI love\nyou too, Y/N. I have since the day you bested Theon in archery. I will never\nforget the look of pure surprise on your face even though you were the one to\nchallenge him. You looked so beautiful and I knew I would love you\nforever.\u201d You giggled slightly at the memory as you leaned over to rest\nyour head on Jon\u2019s shoulder. You stayed that way, swapping memories and stories\nuntil you drifted off to couldn\u2019t keep your eyes open any longer. Jon was with\nyou and you felt safe, happy, and most importantly, loved.</p><p>\u00a0(a/n: Once again, I\u2019d like to be able to find good Jon gifs WITHOUT Dany too. Kinda ruins the whole reader insert vibe sometimes. I\u2019d make them if I knew how XD. Anyway, I hope you lovelies like it!)</p><p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUcOAuHFkajk7LWhq0FodHw\">@brewsthespirit-blog</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mOcznulOLsvbcxlR9zBLW7g\">@ghostie-writes</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB9lZLG-0miZod2nY_CvJFQ\">@line-viper</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mEiY2oSh-axyAA8AHdpth3Q\">@etherealpotter</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mCrjt96d-IzaKnGUzhdCZMg\">@littlemisscaptainfandom</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mPf4F6x7gfblkMJJEWgcYfQ\">@frozenhuntress67</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mMRXgAmVmOVU5evD7qT1zKQ\">@cd1242</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mjPe2BSEOOuoR04SR65K-eQ\">@gruffle1</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/muQ8RCEoiFlaliSH-RAoMFw\">@smalltownbigheart</a></p>",

You couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of being cooped up with Cersei in\nthe wheelhouse for a month. However, your brothers had made it their mission to\nconvince you to join them. Not that it took much. You would do anything for\nyour brothers and they knew it. That was the only reason you were stepping out\nof the wheelhouse in front of the Lord and Lady of Winterfell.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\ngreeted them as their station demanded, but your eyes kept flickering back to\nthe dark-eyed young man behind them. You didn&rsquo;t have to be a genius to know who\nhe was. Everyone knew of Jon Snow, Ned Stark&rsquo;s one indiscretion in his\notherwise honorable life. One look at the young man and you&rsquo;d swear he was all\nStark. Those deep, dark eyes were paired with hair just as dark and the curls\nhe had were similar to his brother Robb&rsquo;s. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\nflashed Jon a smile as you were ushered away to prepare for the feast that\nnight. That was yet another event you had no desire to go to. Luckily, after you\nmade an appearance, you would most likely be able to sneak away without\nattracting attention. That&rsquo;s exactly what you did too. As soon as you had\nfinished eating, you managed to find your way outside and breathed a sigh of\nrelief. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I\nshould have known you&rsquo;d find a way to join us soon or later, Y/N.&ldquo; You\ngrinned at the sound of your brother&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Yes well, you know the\nparties Robert and Cersei life don&rsquo;t suit my fancy.&rdquo; You turned your eyes\nto Jon. He grew uncomfortable under your gaze after a moment. You looked back\nto Tyrion. &ldquo;Please tell me you have wine.&rdquo; Tyrion chuckled and handed\nhis wineskin to you. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Jon was quiet, but his eyes never\nleft you.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Are\nyou nervous, Jon Snow?&ldquo; you asked as you took a swig of your brother&rsquo;s\nwine. Jon shook his head. \"No, my lady. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;you shouldn&rsquo;t be out\nhere with me. You should be inside with the rest of your family and the\nStarks.&rdquo; You rolled your eyes. &ldquo;Please, Y/N will do. I only use my\ntitle when I need something desperately. Besides, maybe I&rsquo;d like to stay out\nhere with you and Tyrion. Join us for a drink, Snow.&rdquo; Jon looked reluctant\nat first, but nodded slowly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\nspent the rest of the evening with the two men, drinking and talking. Jon grew\nmore talkative as he drank, but he never got drunk, not like Tyrion. Tyrion\nended up passing out, leaving you and Jon to stay and get to know one another.\nYou found that you really like the young man. He was loyal and honorable and\nsometimes funny. He had very little pride in himself though. He believed the\nonly way he was worth anything was to join the Night&rsquo;s Watch. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spending\ntime with Jon became your favorite part of being in Winterfell. And you spent a\nlot of time with him. You just couldn&rsquo;t seem to help it. Tyrion, of course,\nencouraged it. He had a fondness for bastards, cripples, and broken things.\nOver the course of your stay, Jon seemed to open up more too and you found\nyourself enjoying his company much more than anyone else&rsquo;s. Your affection for\nhim grew by the day, so when the day came for you to leave, you were\nheartbroken. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I\nhope to see you again one day, Jon. I know it isn&rsquo;t likely since you&rsquo;ll be\ngoing to the Wall, but perhaps I could write now and again,&ldquo; you told him.\nHe gave you a small smile. \"I&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo; The two of you stood\nthere staring at each other for a moment until someone cleared their throat.\n&ldquo;Are we ready?&rdquo; Tyrion asked. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jon\nnodded and, after Tyrion walked away, he leaned in and &nbsp;kissed your cheek. &ldquo;Goodbye, my\nlady.&rdquo; You were grateful no one else was around to see that or you might\nhave melted as you whispered goodbye. You couldn&rsquo;t stop your tears, however, as\nyou climbed into the wheelhouse with your sister. You had no idea if you&rsquo;d ever\nsee Jon again. You only hoped the gods were on your side. </p><p><b>*many\nyears later*</b></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your\nheart skipped a beat when you heard his name. You stood next to Daenerys as\nVarys finished reading the letter. &ldquo;Signed, Jon Snow, King in the\nNorth.&rdquo; You had to fight back a gasp. Jon was alive and he was coming to\nDragonstone! You could have jumped for joy.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It\nhad been years since you last saw him. Many people had come and gone from your\nlife in that time, but you&rsquo;d never felt as close to them as you had to Jon. In\nall this time, your affections for him never lessened much to your surprise.\nYou had expected your feelings to fade but they had only grown stronger as was\nevident by how your heart lurched whenever his name was mentioned. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What\ndo you know about this Jon Snow?&ldquo; Daenerys asked Tyrion. Tyrion&rsquo;s eyes\nshifted to you for a moment before he answered her. You tuned out what he was\nsaying since you couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about Jon. \"And you, Lady Y/N?\nWhat is your impression of Jon Snow?&rdquo; You jumped at the sound of your\nname. You bit your lip, trying to find the right words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"My\nsister is in love with him and has been for years.&ldquo; You hissed his name in\nwarning while Daenerys watched on in amusement. \"I see. And does he return\nyour affections?&rdquo; Your brows furrowed. You had no idea. Neither of you had\nadmitted to any feelings the last you saw him. What if he didn&rsquo;t love you? Or\nworse, what if he did but when he did arrive in Dragonstone he fell for\nDaenerys&rsquo; charms? Men seemed to fall in love with her at the drop of a hat.\nOnly time would tell.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You\nwere on pins and needles a few weeks later when it was announced that Jon had\nfinally sailed in. You waited in Daenerys&rsquo; throne room with the Dragon Queen\nand your brother. It was deadly quiet and you had to stifle a gasp when you saw\nJon. He looked the same and yet completely different. Gone were the boyish\nlooks and, in their place, the ruggedness of a man who had seen and heard too much.\nHis dark locks were pulled back to get them out of his face, which had a couple\nof scars added to it. His eyes were the same though and when they met yours, it\nwas if time stood still. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While\nintroductions were made, you and Jon simply stared at one another, speechless.\nEverything you had been feeling for him was magnified when you set eyes on him.\nYour heart picked up speed and you found it difficult to breathe without\nsighing his name.

            "description": "Hi there! My name is Ellie! Welcome to my tumblr! \u00a0Just thought I'd add a few things to know about me and my blog! If my url gives you any clues, at the heart of this tumblr, I'm a proud Harmony shipper through and through. And while I do still reblog HHR and Dan and Emma content (and I always will) you will find that the majority of my focus has shifted to Jonerys (Jon x Daenerys from Game of Thrones).\u00a0And while you might have to do a little deep blogging to find my reblogs on these, I also ship--both passionately and casually--Cesare x Lucrezia, Mulder x Scully, Lizzington for a while until tptb started to mess with it, Baker x Lawson (Bawson), all the Sense8 ships though Kalagang is my #1, Clint x Natasha (Clintasha), Jane x Thor (Fosterson), Darcy x Loki (Tasertricks), Darcy x Steve (Shieldshock), Kili x Tauriel (Kiliel), Superman x Wonder Woman (Superwonder), and more than I have space for or the memory to list. \nI do my best to tag every post so that if something is your notp, it's nsfw, or it's triggering, you can blacklist it. That said, if you follow me and there is something that you need tagged in order to make it a happy place for you to explore, come into my inbox and let me know :) You will also see a lot of politically charged reblogs in support of women, the queer/gender-queer and trans community, BLM, Muslims, POC, Jewish people, the mentally ill, and austistic people. I'm strongly pro choice, pro inter-sectional feminism, and refuse to call the angry cheeto currently living in the white house president. If anything like that offends you, this might not be the right blog for you.\nLast little few things to throw out there: I'm 35, I plan to adopt at least 4 cats (or more) at some point and be that cat lady everyone's always whispering about, and I tend to greet and converse with everyone I meet like an overeager puppy. \nWhew! Sorry for the long intro folks! Please enjoy your time here, and remember, you're always welcome to come in and say hi!",

His<i> wife</i>.\u00a0</p><p>The title sat warm and comforting in his chest, where the ghost of what had been done to him had oft left an ache that he never thought would leave him. But now that ache was gone, soothed by the woman at his side, his Queen, who had not only saved him more times than he could count on the battlefield, brought her armies and her children to save the whole bloody realm to be sure, but who had also saved him from the darkness that had lingered after he was resurrected; her fire, her passion, and her gentle heart had brought him back to life in a way that Melisandre and her Lord of Light had not.</p><p>Looking down at Dany, at her bright smile that crinkled her eyes just so&ndash;<i>he had not seen her smile like that since they\u2019d left the ship, and he vowed then and there to give her more reasons to do so again</i>&ndash;he thanked the gods that he would have the chance to live whatever remained of his days with this woman that had captured his heart so quickly, and so thoroughly.\u00a0</p><p>His lips tipped up in a gentle smile at the way she gripped the winter roses he had given her before the ceremony, remembering her eyes widening and her lips parting in pleasure at the blue blossoms.

Regretting the deed already?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jon chuckled spite of his current situation; he tipped his head towards her, his lips grazing her ear as he murmured, &ldquo;Regret marrying the most beautiful and powerful woman in all the seven kingdoms?&rdquo; He brushed his mouth just behind her ear, the skin smooth and fragrant with the scented oils she like to use. &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><p>He felt her skin flush with heat at his words and his barely there kiss, and she turned her heard towards him, her violet eyes warm with affection. &ldquo;Then what has you so tense my love?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Jon, knowing he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to lie to his wife, gently growled so only she could hear, &ldquo;I imagined you laying on our bed, those roses spread underneath your body while I fucked you&hellip;Your Grace&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>He watched as her eyes widened in surprise, not at his bluntness, she was rather used to that now, but for what his words meant; her gaze dropped down to his groin and quickly back up again before anyone could possibly notice, and by the twitch of her lips he could tell she was trying not to laugh at his predicament.&nbsp;</p><p>She managed a coy smile instead. &ldquo;Ah, I see your problem, my dear husband.&rdquo; After a short, charged pause, she asked innocently, &ldquo;What shall we do about it?&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stifled a groan, knowing exactly what he wanted to do about it; tell everyone to sod off so he could carry his bride to their room and do exactly what had gotten him into this bloody uncomfortable situation, for the rest of the night and well into the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>But he knew they couldn&rsquo;t, at least not now; everyone was making their way out of the godswood to celebrate their nuptials with ale and wine and tables filled with food that Daenerys had generously supplied from her own stores, and they at least had to put in an appearance for a short while before they disappeared for the evening.&nbsp;</p><p>Letting out a gruff sigh, mouth twisted wryly, Jon said, &ldquo;I know we need to stay with our people for the feast, so there&rsquo;s nothing for it right now.&rdquo; </p><p>She tipped her head in agreement, eyes twinkling with mirth. Then he added in a rough whisper against her cheek, &ldquo;But as soon as it&rsquo;s appropriate, I&rsquo;m going to take you to our rooms, lay you out on the bed exactly as I imagined, and take my time worshippin&rsquo; every inch of you for the rest of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>When Daenerys slowly dragged her small white teeth over the corner of her plump bottom lip, eyes darkening with want and cheeks flushing a pretty pink, he nearly forgot himself then and there; but then he felt her gloved hand gently sliding across his arm in a soothing gesture, her face taking on a softer look, and it had the ravenous beast in him calming like a direwolf pup.&nbsp;</p><p>She reached up and placed her hand against his cheek, leather catching slightly on his short beard. &ldquo;We have all night for that, my love, I promise. This night, and every other night for all of our days to be together as we wish.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Jon closed his eyes against the sting of tears that suddenly threatened to fall; he never thought he would have this, never thought he would find someone who loved him as Daenerys did, completely and without condition, who looked at him and never saw a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark&rsquo;s shame, but as an equal, as Jon Snow, the man that had won her heart as she had won his. He never expected this, and now that he had it, had her warmth and care and love, he vowed to never do anything to lose it.&nbsp;</p><p>Roughly clearing his throat, Jon managed a small smile. &ldquo;Aye, my Queen, we do. And I promise you that I will behave myself until then.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Daenerys huffed out a silent laugh, stroking his cheek lovingly one last time, a deeply fond look on her face, before she tucked her hand back into the crook of his arm, pulling him closer against her. She shifted the flowers in her other arm, bringing them up to her nose to breathe in their scent, then flashed him a brilliant smile. \"Then we best set out my King. The sooner we feast, the sooner you can show me, in detail, what put you in such a&hellip;delicate state.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon playfully growled at her, hiding his growing smile in a kiss pressed against the side of her head, wisps of her moonlit hair tickling his nose. Daenerys giggled at the feel of his beard against her skin, the sound making his heart swell.</p><p>Still smiling, she pulled on his arm to get him moving, and Jon went without hesitation. He would follow Daenerys wherever she lead, arm in arm, hand in hand, for all the rest of their days.&nbsp;</p><p>He loved her. And she loved him. And that was all that mattered. </p></p>",

During the trial he was pardoned, in the end he brought the army to help. Someone (for example Dany) says that as if this army did not cuted them all in a dream. Dany is angry at Tyrion for the fact that this his plan and all another his plans had played against her. After the trial, she comes to Jaime and asks about Aerys. During the story, her expression changes, and when Jaime finishes, she says that he did the right thing, and that her father was an evil man, which somewhat surprises Lannister. The first hint of pregnancy. The way Jon reveals his origins to Dany, and how the battle begins, is little different from what happened on the show. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"450\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"midqueenally:yPPuGt9xe5CdiwSCgToBsg:Zdk4Gs2hqPwpi\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5543f0b9158b04cc7407594946ed6ce3/tumblr_pqn20psmGx1sqtgdgo1_r2_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"450\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><b>Episode 3</b></h2><p>When it takes a long time, and Night King still does not appear on the battlefield, we see how our heroes understand that something is wrong. In the midst of the battle breaks Theon with an army of Ironborn. There was also a pack of wolves (the leader is Nymeria, in the extreme case the Ghost). More characters what in show died \u2013 Podrik, Davos, Tormund, Berik, Edd and Jorah (at the time of his death with him are Dany and Lyanna). Jaime and Brienne light their swords of Valyrian Steel, as in one of their book dreams. They fight shoulder to shoulder against the army of the dead. When the battle is over, it becomes clear that the King of the Night outwitted them and with most of his army headed South. Winterfell suffered serious damage.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"gameofthronesdaily:4UWOynN6ov3kMR13mdk3ZA:ZbYfhs2gZJ7hZ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b2335247cc93bc43911f9d8f8d50d2c/tumblr_pnnw2g99JN1s95j2so1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><b>Episode 4</b></h2><p>Surviors go to Dragonstone. There are disputes about what to do next. Dany finds out she&rsquo;s pregnant. She offers Jon marriage, and he agrees. They also decide to reveal its origin. Dany and Tyrion&rsquo;s relationship is heating up. Tyrion tells his Queen about Cersei&rsquo;s pregnancy and begs to keep her alive, but Dany is determined to &ldquo;tear her down&rdquo;. After the end of the their conversation she, irritably moves away, and we see tense face Tyrion. After that, he writes a letter and secretly sends it. On his way, Night King destroys the Twins or something equally significant. Either in the first episode of the eighth season, or in the final episode of the seventh, Cersei has a miscarriage, and this greatly affects her. She&rsquo;s mad at Dany because she pregnant when Cersei lost the baby, because she&rsquo;s marrying the son of Rhaegar, when Cersei  can\u2019t married Rhaegar in her time. Because of these factors, it finally dawns on her that it is likely that Dany is the young and beautiful Queen from the prophecy. Qyburn reports to her that Night King is coming closer and closer. Cersei intends to take away the Dragon Queen and Night King with her and says to lay wildfire under the city, and also orders the alchemists to work day and night, creating it and Scorpions. Cersei forbids residents to leave the city, anyone who dares to do so will be killed on the spot. Bran is learning more and more about the Night King&rsquo;s motivation. The Golden Swords on the orders of Cersei stormed Dragonstone. During the battle, Qyburn with help Little Birds kills Varys. Jon is fighting on Rhaegal, the resulting battle enemie kills dragon with Scorpions. Harry Strickland is about to kill Jon, who fell from the dragon, but Arya saves his brother, she killed the commander of the Golden Swords. Daenerys goes into a rage and she burns with renewed force the enemy army.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"amomentsnotice:uJdqfolwJVG_dtvnqN2e6A:ZKGCEX2i1rOgF\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b6c32cc5d8c8e8212feed1d77430f13/tumblr_pr2vemNnSv1y7viwpo1_r1_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><p>In the final scene of the episode, the Night King and his army approach King&rsquo;s Landing. Starting to get cold, literally everything, especially the residents, terrified, but Cersei looks at it indifferently from the window of the Red Castle and pours himself wine. On this episode ends.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"daeneryskairipa:WUTmvQiJ8H8qkAViOoXd7Q:ZQifVs2i2HJNu\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22d450286f8a610f4c4596936452f6b8/tumblr_pr4tz1LuK51so1nhno3_r11_540.gif\" data-orig-height=\"250\" data-orig-width=\"540\"/></figure><h2><b>Episode 5</b></h2><p>On the Dragonstone do not have time to move away from the battle with the Golden Swords, as it will know that Night King almost came to King&rsquo;s Landing. There is no other option but to either engage him or allow him to destroy the capital. Dany wants to participate in the battle, because it is the only one who has an adult dragon, which obviously will help in the battle, but due to her pregnancy and Jon with advisors trying to dissuade her. At first she soprotivlyaetsya, but eventually agrees with them. The king of the Night on Viserion destroys the city walls, and the wights running through them, begin to cut everyone in the city. Lannister soldiers try to knock down the dragon-wight with help Scorpions, but it does not have any effect, because, firstly, it is too fast, and secondly, they are not made of dragon glass or obsidian. Viserion burns Scorpions, and later begins to burn the building, but he does not touch people, because they need Night King as the new wights. King&rsquo;s Landing is covered with snow. During this &ldquo;outrage&rdquo; appear &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; and begin the battle. At one point we hear the roar is clearly another dragon and it becomes clear that Dany still could not stand aside. She&rsquo;s on Drogon in the following the armor begins to protect the inhabitants from witow. Residents of the city see this girl on a dragon, which burns the army of the dead to protect them, the one that Cersei frightened them, and you can see that they clearly like this Queen. When you&rsquo;re surrounded by the living ice dead, fire and dragons are good, and this Dragon Queen is like a flame in the flesh. Arya is also trying to save people.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"486\" data-orig-width=\"604\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ea119d78f01b8fc007afb8acf8c914e/tumblr_ptt7scNp6I1wt5r54_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"486\" data-orig-width=\"604\"/></figure><p>Jaime enters the Red Castle and sees Cersei on the Iron Throne. During a conversation with her, he realizes that she, first of all, obviously &ldquo;mad&rdquo;, and secondly, to not be pregnant anymore, and thirdly, plans to blow up everyone and everything. Realizing the latter, first he kills &ldquo;the Pyromancer&rdquo; (Qyburn), and then &ldquo;the Mad King&rdquo; (Cersei). Where Is the Mountain? He fighting against Sandor. There is a Dance of Dragons, at one point we see the red flame of Drogon and the blue flame of Viserion over King&rsquo;s Landing, a beautiful sight. Perhaps it will create obsidian. The battle of Drogon and his mother against their dead brother/son ends with Drogon &ldquo;crowning&rdquo; Viserion as Drogo Viserys. Jon tells Night King that it&rsquo;s all over and attacks him with a scream. Dany can not help, because the Night King is not susceptible to fire. During the battle Jon gets a few serious injuries, but despite this, continues to stand on his feet. Bran paralyzes Night King, and Jon kills him by hitting the place where the Children of the Forest stuck obsidian. Dany descends from Drogon and runs to Jon, who falls and bleeds. There is a touching farewell dialogue. Jaime runs out of the Red Castle and says that now should explode deposits of Wildfire. At this point, the ground begins to shake. All in even more panic trying to escape. King&rsquo;s Landing is exploding. We see the destroyed capital, in the red flame of Drogon, the blue flame of Viserion and the green Wildfire.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"sciencevsromance:y0MjyeXWOn07WSxYhwNCxg:ZsqTby28UYG6u\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee658150caf961ef8f18467907e9d772/tumblr_o9f2n4obet1qz72sno1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"280\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><h2><b>Episode 6</b></h2><p>In the eyes of the survivors of the inhabitants of King&rsquo;s Landing Dany becomes the rightful Queen, who returned from exile and saved them. They recognize her with glee as their ruler. Dany burns the Iron Throne as a symbol of the wheel and the old era. Balerion in his flame forged the throne, Drogon in his destroyed it. Someone finds Tyrion&rsquo;s letter from episode four, which was addressed to Cersei. Tyrion was trying to save his pregnant sister. He is being tried. He says he understands that he made a mistake, that Cersei condemned the city to destruction. He is not executed, but sent into exile. The restoration of the capital begins. Sansa rules the North. It takes a few months, and we see a child Daenerys, who is similar to both parents.</p><figure data-orig-height=\"288\" data-orig-width=\"268\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"yocalio:ibmFiYdDgL1xobJjawcfWQ:ZrGHqw2P5SySC\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76aadc1a1a9ab510c0cc52325a63a24d/tumblr_ouy1wyyQtu1r3i2gwo2_400.gif\" data-orig-height=\"288\" data-orig-width=\"268\"/></figure>",
