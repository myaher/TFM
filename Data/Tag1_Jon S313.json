        "body": "<p>Over the past year I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of asks about Jon and what I think is going on with him. During that time I&rsquo;ve also managed to calm down about the inconsistent number of redshirts during the Wight Hunt. Yes, I remember that this was a thing that happened, along with a bunch of other dei ex machina, like Cersei&rsquo;s brilliant strategies for everything, Jon&rsquo;s repeated, increasingly dumb survivals and the whole Winterfell plot. </p><p>But calming down about them meant that I could think about Game of Thrones again in a manner that kind of naively assumes that the work is coherent . That 2+2=4, not 5, or orange, or a tiger. And this is what I think is going on with Jon and why it is so crucial to the whole work.<br/></p><!-- more --><p><br/></p><p>George R.R. Martin once said that <i>A Song of Ice and Fire </i>is supposed to \nhave a bittersweet ending. Now that phrase covers a lot of ground. A \nbittersweet ending might be just ASOIAF&rsquo;s Scouring of the Shire (which \nat this stage is assured) and a few good guys passing into the Great \nBeyond (also nearly certain) \u2013 which would be a copy of Lord of the \nRings. </p><p>A bittersweet ending might also be Davos, Brienne and Sam \nemerging alone from the rubble like the unhappy winners of a Battle \nRoyale. A few good guys surviving would technically make the ending not a\n complete downer and thus &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo;.</p><p>However, a more nuanced \nlook at a bittersweet ending should look beyond mere survival and \ndestruction but at an ending that irrevocably changes the characters and\n how and what we think of them. </p><p>An issue that strikes readers as unrealistic about Lord of the Rings is\u00a0 that a lot of its human and hobbit-y heroes move on from the events of the story into psychologically very ordinary, uncomplicated lives that they would have lead even without the events of the story. Sam, Merry, Pippin&rsquo;s (and to a lesser degree Faramir, Aragorn and Eowyn&rsquo;s) easy passing into normalcy feels vaguely hollow.</p><p>If GRRM really plans to have a realistic take on Lord of the Rings and its &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo; ending (and with his complaints about Aragorn&rsquo;s tax policy it appears that this is a crucial element of ASOIAF), then obviously he is going to continue what he has been doing all along and create an interplay between narrative events and characterization. Take Arya, for example. In the early parts of AGoT she would have not wanted to become a Faceless Man \u2013 for obvious reasons. But Arya from a few books later, after events have matured and traumatized her, wants to become one. And that choice will again impact her characterization and that will in turn impact future events. \u2028It is logical that this interplay will continue right up until the end. So speculation has to take into account that these characters are dynamic and can be pushed by events into new directions. And not just &ldquo;can&rdquo; \u2013 but will be. </p><p>The question is not who will be alive to experience the Scoured Shire but who they will be at this point. And that change shouldn&rsquo;t just be cosmetic or physical, it needs to be psychological, visible, noticeable and profound. We shouldn&rsquo;t get an Aragorn who just walks into a kingship after a two battles, marries the cute elf girl and then doesn&rsquo;t have a tax plan. <br/></p><p>And obviously, I am not talking about Gilly. I am very much talking about ASOIAF&rsquo;s Aragorn. I am talking about Jon.</p><p>&hellip;<br/></p><p>Now here is a hypothetical scenario for Season 8: Jon with the help of Dany and her dragons (and, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, the usual stock characters who fight every fictional war for us, even those in space), fight the White Walkers, win, then fight Cersei, then win (the order of this is might be reversed) and then Jon&rsquo;s revealed to be true heir and has to rebuild Westeros.</p><p>How does any of this really change and mature Jon as a character? How does being right about everything (the White Walkers being the real threat), then leading a righteous force to victory over evil make him a realistic take on Aragorn?</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t.\u2028</p><p><br/>What Jon needs after five books and seven season of making serviceable to great, sensible, ethical, right strategic choices (with admittedly a number of great tactical errors in between) is being wrong. And not just being wrong about failing to communicate to his sworn brothers what his strategy is, not just wrong about going on that Wight Hunt, not just wrong to send Sam away, not just lightly ethically challenged for exchanging a pair of babies against one mother&rsquo;s will or misleading his love interest on his commitment to her political cause&hellip; but wrong in a truly profound way that the audience cannot blame on stupidity or short-sightedness. </p><p>I admit that calling it &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; or even &ldquo;profoundly wrong&rdquo; is a bit of misnomer. What I am trying to get at is the character going into a direction where the audience cannot and should not easily follow. Those actions would be too alien as might be their rationalizations. These actions should strike the audience as questionable, reprehensible, immoral, unethical, or dishonorable.</p><p>A perhaps too perfect example of such an action is Cersei firing up the Sept. It&rsquo;s mass murder and it&rsquo;s intended by her to be mass murder. If anyone in the audience found it not reprehensible and immoral, I would have some questions for these people.</p><p>But Cersei firing up the Sept was a success. Her survival was at stake - and she survived. Before her kingdom was full of powerful enemies and afterwards it wasn&rsquo;t. And she even snatched the Iron Throne afterwards despite having no royal Targaryen or Baratheon ancestry.</p><p>In realpolitik terms, Cersei made the &ldquo;right&rdquo; choice. All other choices would have lead to her death. The first rule of anything is that you cannot do anything if you&rsquo;re dead.</p><p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s a lesson Jon desperately needs to learn. His twice-tried strategy of rushing alone against an army of his enemies is idiotic. It might be honorable for a war leader to be the first person on the battlefield but it&rsquo;s not a winning war strategy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a nice thing to say, but it&rsquo;s necessary for a war time general or commander to be willing to have other people die for him and his goal. And not just for him but in front of him, literally shielding him. An army commander who isn&rsquo;t willing to ensure his own survival, is gambling with such terrible odds that he has already lost the war. </p><p>Cersei&rsquo;s strategy of killing her enemies instead of allowing herself to be killed is profoundly wrong, immoral and yet Jon needs understand that when mankind&rsquo;s survival are at stake an immoral action like that might be a necessary choice.</p><p>His attempt to drown in an ice lake alone is a sign that at this point he hasn&rsquo;t understood the necessity of being alive to lead a war at all. As George S. Patton put it: &ldquo;no poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb son-of-a-bitching bastard die for his country.&rdquo;</p><p>Out of all our main protagonists, Jon has never been willing to play as dirty as it should be necessary for an apocalyptic fight such as his. Unlike Sansa&rsquo;s willingness to go along with Littlefinger&rsquo;s nefarious plans for her cousin in the Vale, Arya&rsquo;s willingness to kill potentially innocent people for the Faceless Men, Tyrion raping a prostitute and killing Shae, the torture of innocents during Dany\u2019s Slavers\u2019s Bay arc, Bran warging Hodor&hellip; Jon has nothing in his arc that is as dark, dishonorable or questionable as these things. Jon appears to be a character class apart, like the hero of a more classic fantasy epic.</p><p>Is this because Jon&rsquo;s so special that his arc is a whole different genre or is this because he hasn&rsquo;t leveled up in realpolitik yet?</p><p>Or is there perhaps even a third option to deal with his relative over-the-top good guy characterization?</p><p>***</p><p>You know, when it comes to stories about morality like Game of Thrones a crucial factor for their success is not just the quality of the good guys but also the quality of the villains.</p><p>And what makes a compelling villain?</p><p>IMO, they hit more than one of these characteristics:</p><p>1. They are well-rounded, fully realized characters, drawn with the same care as the heroes.</p><p>2. They are able to win against the good guys. They are not a cardboard that will be blown over once the heroes wave a magic stick or sword around.</p><p>3. Their evil deeds get an emotional reaction out of the audience. (Most audiences tend to have a vague discomfort with CGI mass carnage while reacting to a well-executed scene of high school bullying with actual empathy or even horror.)</p><p>4. Their motivations are understandable, perhaps even sympathetic. At best they are a well-intentioned extremist, utilitarianism gone wrong, rather than setting stuff on fire because their mom was mean to them once.</p><p>Now looking at this list, it becomes obvious that GOT has a problem with its current crop of villains. Any of the three that are left (Cersei, the Night King, Euron) could be the Final Boss \u2013 to use a video game term. But none of them are very compelling villains. Two of them are inhuman monsters. To call their characterization shallow would be an insult to puddles. </p><p>And Cersei, the only one with a decent characterization (and some past Mean Girls bullying sins of her own) suffers from being incredibly stupid in the books, having a prophecy running against her and stealing Aegon from Essos&rsquo; story in the show. In other words, Cersei&rsquo;s chances of success and survival and actually making it this far in the books are as good as that of a snowflake on a hot summer&rsquo;s day. One suspects that she is a show-only final-ish villain, so if one looks for GRRM\u2019s final-ish villains, they would not find Cersei.<br/></p><p>Talking about chances of success \u2013 the Night King isn\u2019t winning this either. Because then ASOIAF would reveal itself to be a nihilistic mess in which all the human storylines were nothing but shaggydog stories. So the Night King is \u00a0bound to melt in the summer sun along with Cersei. There is little question about it. And is Euron &ldquo;was he even mentioned in the first book?&rdquo; Greyjoy \u00a0really going to win the Iron Throne in the end? Is anyone taking this possibility seriously?</p><p>And what are their motivations? Ambition, being evil and being anti-human. None of them are particularly sympathetic.</p><p>In one word, GOT&rsquo;s current crop of villains is not particularly exciting \u2013 especially if you compare them with some of the villains that came before them. And if one of these three is the Final Boss, he or she is gonna be lame.</p><p>But a lame Final Boss is actually a great tradition in the genre. In Lord of the Rings Sauron appears to be literally two-dimensional and about as interesting as a character. (Gollum gets to be the well-written villain and he is doing very little damage to the world at large.) Voldemort in Harry Potter is completely outshone as the most despised, scary villain of the series by the one-book-wonder Dolores Umbridge who excels at committing low-key evil deeds that make every reader/viewer wince in sympathy. The Emperor in the original Star Wars trilogy is&hellip; there and then dead and has fewer fans than a one-line bounty hunter. And the same fans that endlessly shout &ldquo;Han shot first&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t even appear to care that he got a complete face replacement in the Special Editions. And if there is one consistent complaint about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it&rsquo;s that its villains tend to be boring and forgettable. Yet they&rsquo;re lame and forgettable to the tune of billions of box office dollars.</p><p>So a lame Final Boss for the heroes to fight&hellip; that is indeed a thing. And that might be just the thing GOT/ASOIAF is doing. This is what we have to seriously consider. We are likely to get a MCU villain&hellip; you know on the level of Ronan the Destroyer or Malekith, the Dark Elf. And you probably need to google in which movies those two turned up.</p><p>That would be a terrible let down.</p><p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s not actually that terrible of a thing? Because if our final boss and villain is not Cersei, the Night King, or Euron, it&rsquo;s a good guy gone bad. Someone who is currently fighting on the side of the living before becoming someone who needs to be fought.</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible that this is in the cards. After &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;, the penultimate episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, aired, GRRM wrote on his blog that &ldquo;Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros, I need to do something about that.&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p>The thing is that White appeared to start out as a sympathetic if flawed hero you were rooting for even as he was making meth. What made White monstrous is not doing depraved psycho shit beyond comprehension (like nailing a living, pregnant woman to a ship like Euron Greyjoy) but that he appears to evolve into this monster before the audience&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p><i>Breaking Bad</i> tricks the audience into liking a character for much longer than he ever deserved and that becomes crystal clear in that penultimate episode. If GRRM wants a monster like White he can&rsquo;t use his old, repetitive trick of making a one-dimensional psychopath do depraved stuff. He has to logically progress a character we root for into a monster.</p><p>(Of course, GRRM might also not be able to pull it off, however much he wants to. It could be that he has not prepared the ground to make a main character go Walter White and thus it will always fall short of Breaking Bad&rsquo;s accomplishment. Sure, Greyworm or Dolorous Edd could become evil and monstrous but even GRRM should know that&rsquo;s not quite the same as making your main protagonist evil.</p><p>I might also be wrong on GRRM understanding what makes Walter White feel so monstrous. The first big sign that White took the road down to hell is not an act of murder or sadism but simply not helping someone who is choking to death. His monstrosity is based in a three-dimensional characterization, not in particularly outrageous acts of evil. He is monstrous because he used to be likable. If GRRM doesn&rsquo;t see that, he might actually think that one-dimensional psychopath Euron nailing his pregnant girlfriend to a ship is nailing the same kind of monstrosity.</p><p>He also could be talking about a plot point we now know about but that he has not published yet \u2013 like Stannis burning Shireen. So one should be careful looking for ASOIAF&rsquo;s Walter White.)</p><p>Interestingly enough, the trick <i>Breaking Bad</i> is pulling is quite old. White isn&rsquo;t making meth by chance, it was the worst thing his creator could think of besides him becoming an arms dealer. The twist of Breaking Bad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo; is actually not that White becomes bad but that he has always been bad. You&rsquo;ll find a similar character in Humbert Humbert in Nabokov&rsquo;s <i>Lolita</i> where his monstrosity is barely a plot twist and even Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> where it&rsquo;s none at all. (The trope of the protagonist being a piece of shit throughout the whole story usually goes down as &ldquo;villain protagonist&rdquo; and the list of stories containing one is pretty expansive.) But the plot twist of a surprise villain protagonist is such an old one that Aesop already codified it in his fable &ldquo;The Farmer and the Viper&rdquo; around 600 B.C. (Farmer helps harmless looking viper, then viper bites him because it&rsquo;s a viper. And has been a viper all along. Duh.)</p><p>Now if Dany, for example, turned into a villain then she would fall squarely into villain protagonist territory. But the fun thing is that doesn&rsquo;t mean that she is already one. The viper is not a villain until Aesop has it biting the farmer. If Dany decides to slaughter her future subjects by the thousands just so she can have the Iron Throne (and this is portrayed as despicable) then this will be in line with the Dany from the first season/AGoT who wanted the Dothraki to wage their type of warfare (pillaging, raping, enslaving, killing) onto thousands of her future subjects, so she could have the Iron Throne. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Dany will cross this particular moral event horizon.</p><p>Whether Dany will turn out to be a villain protagonist is not a question of foreshadowing. It&rsquo;s a question whether the authorial intent will will it into existence. The viper is a poisonous snake but if the author hasn&rsquo;t it biting the farmer, that poison doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p><p>Now Dany is a well-rounded character (same as Cersei) and might be difficult to defeat but her most likely, hypothetical, evil deed (mass carnage via dragon) is not particularly compelling and neither is ambition as her motivation. Villainous Dany is about as compelling as Cersei. Keeping Cersei for so long when there is Villainous Dany in the wings strikes me as a weak narrative choice:\u00a0\u201cMeet your new villain, same as the old villain&hellip;\u201d The difference would be the element of surprise but that&rsquo;s a paltry surprise, especially since Villainous Dany was supposed to be The Big Plot Twist. <br/></p><p>Honestly, Dany as the mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain is a low-hanging fruit. Call me edgy, but it&rsquo;s just nowhere near &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s Boromir getting seduced by the Ring.</p><p>And there are not a lot of precedents for that storyline in ASOIAF. You know the story of a good guy gone beyond redemption evil. There is Theon, whose ambition, jealousy and insecurity drove him into sacking Winterfell and killing two children \u2013 but even he turned out to be not to be beyond redemption. There is Catelyn, but she goes crazy and becomes a zombie, so it&rsquo;s hard to compare.</p><p>But there is, of course, the most compelling, interesting and meaningful character arc of a good guy gone bad: Stannis Baratheon. But he isn\u2019t a good precedent for a mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain.<br/></p><p>***</p><p>You see, Stannis starts out as not exactly the most sympathetic character: he burns people and places of worship, he is a religious nut, he has his brother killed. But after getting defeating at the Battle of Blackwater, his arc does a 180. He gets the call from the North to save the realm, and out of all of the five Kings involved in the war of the same name, he is the only one he realizes that in order to &ldquo;win the realm, you have to save the realm.&rdquo;</p><p>That isn&rsquo;t a coincidence. Stannis is also the only king who fights for a higher purpose. Joffrey, Balon, Robb, and Renly just fight for power (be it the power over all of Westeros or the power that lies in independence). Stannis is fighting not just for power but also for his religion, for his one true god; he is fighting a crusade. That out of all the kings, the king who believes that his religion will save Westeros ends up wanting to save it from a supernatural threat is not a coincidence. One thing clearly causes the other.</p><p>And once he makes this choice, Stannis, the Mannis (as he was lovingly called by his fans once upon a time) always fights the bad guys, he fights for the living. Of course, he doesn&rsquo;t stop being a religious nut, he doesn&rsquo;t stop burning people, he is inflexible in his beliefs, he still thinks he is the chosen one, he is Azor Ahai, he is the One True King, he belongs on the Iron Throne. But he is also the man who executes soldiers of his army who rape. He has good sides. But what weighs so heavily in his favor is that out of all the people in power in Westeros, he is fighting the bad guys.</p><p>And that matters \u2013 until it doesn&rsquo;t when Stannis strikes out to fight the Boltons. The Boltons are special because they are despicable without exceptions. Even the Freys have Robb&rsquo;s squire in their midst to have that one decent family member/bannerman that all of Westeros&rsquo; notable houses appear to have. All but the Boltons anyway. There is not a good or decent living Bolton. They are the literal worst Westeros has to offer.</p><p>And yet, Stannis manages to cross a moral event horizon that makes everyone forget that he is doing it to fight the Worst. And that moral event horizon is not the sacking of a city, the killing of hundred of thousands. He is not extinguishing a house or a people. He manages it, doing something every single GOT character could do right now (save for little Sam.) He kills a single person.</p><p>And he doesn&rsquo;t come back from that. Like a proper Ozymandias, his hubris, his pretension to predestined, prophecied greatness is followed by his inevitable decline. Killing Shireen has Stannis losing his real world fans and his in-story followers, his wife, his fight, his priestess, his army, his purpose and consequently his life. He proves very quickly that not all ends justify all means. He is the living embodiment of the Friedrich Nietzsche quotation that &ldquo;those who fight monsters should take care that in the process they do not become monsters themselves.&rdquo; \u00a0</p><p>Stannis&rsquo; final turn into villainy is actually paralleled by something another character does in ASOIAF. Except he is not a character we meet; he is a story-within-a-story; a legend, a prophecy or both. He is who Stannis thought he was: he is Azor Ahai. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>And Azor Ahai absolutely does what Stannis did to turn into a villain, a monster: he murders&hellip; sacrifices an innocent to forge Lightbringer to end the Long Night. The way the story gets told makes that murder necessary, but Azor Ahai as the hero and winner of the Long Night gets to tell that story, gets to tell history his way. It&rsquo;s a legend and of course Azor Ahai is its hero. But remember the first person who claimed that &ldquo;only death can pay for life&rdquo; was a liar who wanted to make sure that &ldquo;The Stallion Who Mounts the World&rdquo; died in the womb. (The second was Melisandre who tends to be wrong on a lot of things and whose track record on human sacrifice is abysmal.)</p><p>So there is absolutely a chance that Nissa Nissa&rsquo;s death was as necessary as Shireen&rsquo;s. We won&rsquo;t get the opportunity to fact-check the legend, the ancient history. But if it&rsquo;s a prophecy we might see its reality. </p><p>Of course, if GOT really goes the way of making a good guy go bad, then they can do this the middling way, the mediocre way. Theon&rsquo;s Sack of Winterfell Redux or Catelyn&rsquo;s descent into madness and murder. Or by making Dany a villain protagonist who is basically just another Cersei with dragons. And despite not quite measuring up to Stannis&rsquo; dark turn \u2013 ambition, grief, fear, insecurity, jealousy, vanity, or disappointment leading to mass carnage delivered onto a hundred-thousand computer-generated extras is still more interesting than the Night King Sauron with his ice dragon. </p><p><br/></p><p>But the reality is that we don&rsquo;t care about the 100,000 inhabitants of King&rsquo;s Landing. We will cry over a single Hot Pie before ever giving a fuck about a massive number of fictional people without any characteristics. Mass carnage is easy to oppose morally because it&rsquo;s something we oppose in real life but emotionally there is no difference between 10 fictional people or a billion fictional people \u2013 if they are simply there to be nameless, featureless cannon fodder. The ability to cause mass carnage doesn&rsquo;t make you the most emotionally effective villain by default. Quite the opposite. </p><p>If Bran were to warg a dragon and set King&rsquo;s Landing on fire, we would get that this whole Three-Eyed Raven thing didn&rsquo;t work out well for his ethics and be, like, &ldquo;okay&rdquo;. If Bran set fire to Arya, he would immediately become the most hated character ever on GOT. (And that isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration for effect). And any good intentions regarding defeating evil would matter as much as the fight against the Boltons did once Shireen started screaming. </p><p>I would like to add that Stannis died pretty much immediately after killing Shireen, blown over like a cardboard once Brienne showed up. But who would defeat or want to defeat a Stannis, an Azor Ahai who succeeded at ending the Long Night?</p><p>The ultimate story subversion when it comes to the classic &ldquo;good vs. evil&rdquo; plot is that the bad guy wins.</p><p> And wouldn&rsquo;t that be something if it was surprise villain protagonist? We get someone winning that we would have been okay with winning until they turned into GOT&rsquo;s least liked character? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be bittersweet? Getting who you were okay with, perhaps even wanted on the Iron Throne, who might even know which is the right tax plan and what to do with baby orcs&hellip; \u00a0except they suck now?</p><p>Now who could that true Azor Ahai possibly be?</p><p>Is there someone who has been fighting monsters longer than anyone else has? Who has been so corrupted by that fight that he has tried and sacrificed already everything he could and had to defeat them? A man on quasi-religious crusade? A man who has the sort of righteous hubris and single-minded focus on the White Walkers that makes him often deaf to good advice? Who who has already laid down his life for a chance&hellip; and even a &ldquo;no-chance-at-all-now-let-me-drown-in-an-ice-lake&rdquo; at defeating the Night King? Is this possibly the same guy who we think is going to be crucial to the defeat of the White Walkers? \u00a0The one who has the perfect bloodline to claim the Iron Throne in the end? The one who is shown to Melisandre when she looks for her prophecied chosen one in the fire? The one who appears to be the straight hero of the story, the Luke Skywalker, the only major character where pulling a Stannis would actually shock us? \u00a0The one who has never been &ldquo;profoundly wrong&rdquo;?</p><p>I am not saying, we are getting &ldquo;Aegon, the Worst of His Name&rdquo;. I am saying that if I wanted to create a villain who subverts all expectations while fulfilling them, a villain who is truly compelling and whose turn emotionally wrecks the audience, I would not make it happen by having Daenerys or Bran roast King&rsquo;s Landing. I simply would choose a more likable and successful version of Stannis and have him doing something terrible, wrongfully believing it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p><p>Now theoretically this could be anyone but little Sam. And regardless of that character&rsquo;s identity, they would be a great, compelling villain. Practically though, the best candidate for going off that particular deep end is not some random second tier character. And it&rsquo;s not Daenerys &ldquo;What Even Are White Walkers?&rdquo; or Bran &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <strike>a robotic, omniscient plot device now</strike> the Three-Eyed Raven now&rdquo; Stark either. </p><p>It&rsquo;s Jon. </p><p>***</p><p>There is an issue with this though. Stannis murdering a family member/sacrificing a child for their royal blood to win a battle was simply a continuation of Stannis&rsquo; previous actions. Stannis had no issue with his wife&rsquo;s uncle being burned as a sacrifice to R'hllor, had his brother murdered to win a battle, and attempted to have his underage nephew (Edric Storm in the books, Gendry in the show) sacrificed for his royal blood.</p><p>Killing Shireen is Stannis taking this to its logical extreme. Everything he does is simply something he has done before. Except this time the audience isn&rsquo;t given an out: Shireen doesn&rsquo;t escape like Edric/Gendry, we care for her (unlike Alester Florent) and she isn&rsquo;t Stannis&rsquo; opponent in battle (Renly).</p><p>What Stannis is doing, is not surprising or entirely unprecedented. It is ultimately just a darker twist on something he has done before. Which is weird because you would think that something that crosses a moral event horizon would be a real departure from his previous actions. But it&rsquo;s not and that is really crucial if we want to discuss Stannis 2.0.</p><p>If a good character goes bad then having them simply do something they&rsquo;ve done before \u2013 \u00a0except this time it&rsquo;s just too much \u2013 makes sense. Just like the road to hell is paved with good intentions, escalating villainy should be a slippery slope of ever indefensible bad deeds.</p><p>And this is why it makes no sense to look at Jon and wonder who he is going to burn at the stake for R'hllor \u2013 because he won&rsquo;t. \u00a0What he would do to incur the audience&rsquo;s disdain needs to be something he has kind of done before. And that he has done on the show before, because it stands to reason that the show would want to keep its foreshadowing. (Hence Gendry&rsquo;s slightly pointless kidnapping by Melisandre in the show.)</p><p>So the the baby swap is out since it didn&rsquo;t happen on the show. Breaking a vow is a bit too generic and on its lonesome will not evoke any emotional reaction. And making high-handed, impulsive decisions that end up with terrible consequences has been already done with Jon making a series of high-handed, badly thought through decisions that netted the Night King a dragon and destroyed the Wall and yet netted Jon no audience disdain at all. So probably not that one either.</p><p>That leaves his relationship with Ygritte. In the books, we only see this relationship from Jon&rsquo;s point of view with all his justifications and inner struggles and his self-knowledge that while he lies about his allegiance to the Wildlings&rsquo; cause, his feelings for Ygritte are real.</p><p>Now if one imagines that relationship from Ygritte&rsquo;s point of view (as she is in the books), Jon would come out of that as a supreme douchebag. He lead her on, lied to her, pretended to have feelings for her, then left her, publicly humiliated her and finally participated in a battle with her on the other side. Jon doesn&rsquo;t kill her but he is willing to do so by fighting her. </p><p>Now a real neutral point of view that doesn&rsquo;t vilify Ygritte to prop up Jon as a cool dude (as the show has done with her allying herself with cannibals and the village massacre), would be more of a wash, ethically speaking. Jon lies to Ygritte but his life is at stake and it wasn&rsquo;t even his own idea in the first place. There are consent issues with their relationship and Ygritte is as willing to kill Jon when she participates in that battle as it&rsquo;s the case the other way around.</p><p>But then Stannis wasn&rsquo;t that unjustified to go after Renly who was willing to fight and kill him in battle after all. Killing Renly nearly rates as self-defense. And Edric Storm got away. The question is not how horrible Jon&rsquo;s actions towards Ygritte were. But rather what the escalation of that sort of overall action would be like.</p><p>Now due to time constraints the only relationship where Jon could pull an escalated &ldquo;Ygritte&rdquo; is his relationship with Daenerys. And here I am kind of puzzled by the discourse around the idea. Because as passionately as people argue about it, they actually agree quite fundamentally: that Jon is doing it/not doing because he is the quintessential good guy. </p><p>That he either betrays his lover or the plutocratic will of his nation is disregarded as some sort of higher purpose collateral that doesn&rsquo;t at all reflect on his moral character.</p><p>But isn&rsquo;t Occam&rsquo;s Razor to the question of how a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; manages to betray either lover or nation simply to question the &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; part?</p><p>But let&rsquo;s step back a bit. The theory that Jon is playing Dany proposes that Jon initiates this emotional manipulation because she wonders aloud about two things (while he wants her commitment on the fight against the White Walkers): 1. Her ability to achieve her overall strategic goal of winning the Iron Throne 2. What happens to her rear if she pulls all of her forces north.</p><p>Now, Jon never actually answers any of these questions (or any questions on how to get the Northern Lords to remain loyal to him and Dany) and that is a bit problematic. Because the second question of what happens in a war if you leave one side open to your enemies is an enormously important one.</p><p>What Jon appears to do, is rely on a truism about the North: that it cannot be conquered in Winter (and Winter is here.)</p><p>*beleaguered sigh*</p><p>This truism exists in our world about two countries. One is considered unconquerable in Winter, the other unconquerable in general. And while these truisms have held true for few centuries now, the reality is that attempts to conquer them have devastated both countries on more than one occasion to the sound of millions of dead inhabitants and bombing it to the bottom of the HDI.</p><p>If Jon relies on Winter to protect him and his allies from Cersei, he is an idiot. If Cersei attacks the unprotected North from the South, his ability to fight the White Walkers will be profoundly diminished even if Cersei fails at conquering the North itself. Dany is right to ask this question and he is wrong to ignore it. </p><p>And if that theory pans out and Jon took these strategic, legitimate concerns as a sign that he needs to loverboy it up instead of thinking how to protect the North from the South, then that&rsquo;s next level mansplaining. <br/></p><p>But forget that point for a bit and go back to the situation in which Jon supposedly initiates it. He is recovering after the Wight Hunt and Dany swears to avenge her dragon while musing on her overall strategy of winning Westeros. And while Jon isn&rsquo;t in good shape, he is not in mortal danger. Not in general, not specifically by Dany. She is letting her hair down and she&rsquo;s pledging her support to his cause. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s life is not the least on the line and the question whether Dany would or would not have pulled out of the war against the White Walkers if Jon hadn&rsquo;t started flirting with her in that moment is an unanswerable hypothetical. No matter how you slice or dice it, it&rsquo;s not certain at all (not to the audience, not to Jon) that she would have pulled out. </p><p>So Jon had three choices in this moment: not initiate a romantic relationship with Dany, initiate a romantic relationship out of genuine feeling, initiate a romantic relationship to manipulate her. </p><p>None of these choices would spell certain doom. It&rsquo;s not at all like the relationship with Ygritte, where not going along with it would have blown his cover and cost his life. It&rsquo;s also distinct from that situation insofar as he didn&rsquo;t choose to go undercover with the Wildlings in the first place but was commanded into the situation by his superior officer.</p><p>If Jon initiated the relationship to manipulate Dany, he chose to do this voluntarily without true necessity. It&rsquo;s, in fact, as necessary as Littlefinger manipulating Lysa into intrigue, murder and ill-fated marriage was. Of course, without that manipulation Littlefinger would have never advanced at court and become Master of the Coin, Lord of Harrenhall and Sweetrobin&rsquo;s guardian. But none of these things were necessary to grant his survival at any time.</p><p>The key difference between Jon and Littlefinger is that Jon allies himself with Dany to ensure mankind&rsquo;s survival instead of personal gain. But on the balance, another difference between Littlefinger and Jon&rsquo;s situation is that the romantic relationship wasn&rsquo;t necessary to ensure Dany&rsquo;s support. In fact, even the idea that Dany&rsquo;s concerns are sign of her wavering in her commitment is a minority if not fringe opinion among GOT&rsquo;s audience.</p><p>And that makes the idea of Jon manipulating Dany very unpalatable. The lack of necessity makes him a Littlefinger, rather than a Robb or a Ned or even the Jon who lied to Ygritte. And audiences prefer to see their heroes as honorable fools rather than manipulative, emotionally abusive jerks.</p><p>Because there is the heart of the problem. If Jon is truly manipulating Dany, he is an emotionally abusive jerk. He is profoundly wrong. He is the guy that your BFF has warned you about. &ldquo;He is just using you for [something.]&rdquo;</p><p>And that hits home in a way shadowbabies and Frey Pies and Qyburn doesn&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t know any necromancers who vivisect people. But we know the kind of jerk that Jon would be. It&rsquo;s not theoretical, it&rsquo;s something we know and because of that will not appreciate.</p><p>***</p><p>But while this absolutely checks off\u00a0\u201cmake the evil deed painful to the audience\u201d point in the \u201ccompelling villain\u201d check list, it\u2019s still nowhere near as ethically questionable as Stannis burning Shireen. <br/></p><p>But Jon&rsquo;s Ygritte storyline doesn&rsquo;t end with him duping, betraying and leaving her. It ends with her getting killed. And not just killed, but killed in battle against Jon and his brothers. While Jon is not directly responsible for her death \u2013 he neither instigated nor executed the killing \u2013 he was willing to risk that his actions would kill her in that battle. The goal of a battle is to win and to use the Patton quote from above &ldquo;make the other bastard die for his country.&rdquo; Of course, Jon acted in self-defense, Ygritte was fighting that battle against him and the NW voluntarily, fully willing, ready and able to kill him.</p><p>But then, to go back to Stannis, Stannis was also just acting in self-defense when he send the shadowbaby assassin to kill Renly. Renly had the superior force and showed himself fully willing, ready and able to kill Stannis in battle. The question whether Stannis&rsquo; assassination of Renly is justified is a digression too far because that is not the point. The point is that Jon and Stannis got some person killed who was really close to them (brother, lover) and that was kind of, maybe, perhaps justified self-defense. You can argue for it in both cases. </p><p>However, as I mentioned before, Stannis&rsquo; ultimate escalation of Renly&rsquo;s murder is killing Shireen. There is no maybe, perhaps, kind of, about the lack of justification for it. Stannis did not act in self-defense, Stannis was not provoked. The true necessity was also absent&hellip; although the proof for that is just hindsight. The sacrifice was supposed to save Stannis and his army. It did not. Thus it was never necessary. The whole thing is just wholly indefensible.</p><p>Now would an escalation of Jon&rsquo;s Ygritte storyline limit itself to the affair and betrayal or would it go all the way down to that self-defensive arrow that Jon wasn&rsquo;t directly responsible for? Except for a Stannis-like escalation that arrow could not be self-defensive, it would have to be undeserved, unjustified, unnecessary <i>and</i> Jon&rsquo;s responsibility. </p><p>The audience doesn&rsquo;t even have to like Dany at that point. That would be just crossing all moral event horizons, turning Jon into a villain and serving a &ldquo;<strike>King Arthur</strike> <strike>Aragorn</strike> Jon \u00a0Snow is the final villain&rdquo; plot twist that makes R+L=J look like child&rsquo;s play in comparison. It would be truly an epic twist, ending up in the plot twist pantheon next to &ldquo;Bruce is a ghost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soylent Green&rdquo;.</p><p>However, I don&rsquo;t think this is gonna happen. A villain protagonist on that level would have been foreshadowed much, much more, both in the books and the show. &ldquo;The villain wins&rdquo; is also really nihilistic and ends up on a quite bitter note with very little sweetness. Davos, Brienne and Sam emerging alone from the rubble would be a more positive and happier ending. It&rsquo;s also the sort of plot twist you think of five books and seven TV seasons later (too late), not when you conceive the story. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>So what will happen to Jon instead if he doesn&rsquo;t become a villain?</p><p>There are really only two options: his characterization remains in a class of its own and he remains the only truly good guy protagonist or he takes a level in realpolitik and starts to play as dirty as necessary in whatever way. Not quite Jon, the villain but Jon the ethically challenged, Jon the Utilitarian. <br/></p><p>(By the way, I am not saying that he has to play dirty with specific characters to qualify, just that that he has to play dirty somehow. In fact, playing dirty with certain characters might evoke a negative, emotional audience reaction that is not in proportion to the ethics violation it presents and thus the whole Utilitarianism bit might accidentally devolve into perceived villainy.)</p><p>The really fascinating bit about this is that Jon&rsquo;s characterization will define ASOIAF quite significantly. Jon is so crucial to the story&rsquo;s most fundamental conflict, that even if you discard the idea that he is <a href=\"http://blindestspot.tumblr.com/post/166182300140/aegon-his-is-the-song-of-ice-and-fire\">The Protagonist</a>, you would still have to agree that he is one of the most important protagonists. His characterization will contribute and lead to the resolution of that conflict. If he resolves it by playing dirty, the moral of the story will quite different than it is if he resolves it by always taking the heroic, high road. </p><p>And it&rsquo;s not just the moral of the story. Once the story decides to land on &ldquo;Jon, the moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jon, the Utilitarian&rdquo;, the question whether we are consuming &ldquo;Lord of the Rings with boobs&rdquo; or a true deconstruction of Lord of the Rings will answer itself. And that will reflect on more than just Jon&rsquo;s storyline. If Jon stays heroic, Night King Sauron, our final, two-dimensional villain and other neat and flat resolutions become much more likely.</p><p>As such I would argue that the Jon\u2019s characterization will define how good ASOIAF&rsquo;s famed realism truly is, what ideals it propagates, and what kind of story ASOIAF is. </p><p>I honestly can&rsquo;t predict how this will play out. But I remember that Ned and the Red Wedding promised a deconstruction of the genre, an acknowledgement that taking the high road constantly can be a dead end in real life. Jon not needing to be smarter than them in the end would break that promise. <br/></p>",

Martin once said that <i>A Song of Ice and Fire </i>is supposed to \nhave a bittersweet ending. Now that phrase covers a lot of ground. A \nbittersweet ending might be just ASOIAF\u2019s Scouring of the Shire (which \nat this stage is assured) and a few good guys passing into the Great \nBeyond (also nearly certain) \u2013 which would be a copy of Lord of the \nRings. </p><p>A bittersweet ending might also be Davos, Brienne and Sam \nemerging alone from the rubble like the unhappy winners of a Battle \nRoyale. A few good guys surviving would technically make the ending not a\n complete downer and thus \u201cbittersweet\u201d.</p><p>However, a more nuanced \nlook at a bittersweet ending should look beyond mere survival and \ndestruction but at an ending that irrevocably changes the characters and\n how and what we think of them. </p><p>An issue that strikes readers as unrealistic about Lord of the Rings is\u00a0 that a lot of its human and hobbit-y heroes move on from the events of the story into psychologically very ordinary, uncomplicated lives that they would have lead even without the events of the story. Sam, Merry, Pippin\u2019s (and to a lesser degree Faramir, Aragorn and Eowyn\u2019s) easy passing into normalcy feels vaguely hollow.</p><p>If GRRM really plans to have a realistic take on Lord of the Rings and its \u201cbittersweet\u201d ending (and with his complaints about Aragorn\u2019s tax policy it appears that this is a crucial element of ASOIAF), then obviously he is going to continue what he has been doing all along and create an interplay between narrative events and characterization. Take Arya, for example. In the early parts of AGoT she would have not wanted to become a Faceless Man \u2013 for obvious reasons. But Arya from a few books later, after events have matured and traumatized her, wants to become one. And that choice will again impact her characterization and that will in turn impact future events. \u2028It is logical that this interplay will continue right up until the end. So speculation has to take into account that these characters are dynamic and can be pushed by events into new directions. And not just \u201ccan\u201d \u2013 but will be. </p><p>The question is not who will be alive to experience the Scoured Shire but who they will be at this point. And that change shouldn\u2019t just be cosmetic or physical, it needs to be psychological, visible, noticeable and profound. We shouldn\u2019t get an Aragorn who just walks into a kingship after a two battles, marries the cute elf girl and then doesn\u2019t have a tax plan. <br></p><p>And obviously, I am not talking about Gilly. I am very much talking about ASOIAF\u2019s Aragorn. I am talking about Jon.</p><p>\u2026<br></p><p>Now here is a hypothetical scenario for Season 8: Jon with the help of Dany and her dragons (and, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, the usual stock characters who fight every fictional war for us, even those in space), fight the White Walkers, win, then fight Cersei, then win (the order of this is might be reversed) and then Jon\u2019s revealed to be true heir and has to rebuild Westeros.</p><p>How does any of this really change and mature Jon as a character? How does being right about everything (the White Walkers being the real threat), then leading a righteous force to victory over evil make him a realistic take on Aragorn?</p><p>It doesn\u2019t.\u2028</p><p><br>What Jon needs after five books and seven season of making serviceable to great, sensible, ethical, right strategic choices (with admittedly a number of great tactical errors in between) is being wrong. And not just being wrong about failing to communicate to his sworn brothers what his strategy is, not just wrong about going on that Wight Hunt, not just wrong to send Sam away, not just lightly ethically challenged for exchanging a pair of babies against one mother\u2019s will or misleading his love interest on his commitment to her political cause\u2026 but wrong in a truly profound way that the audience cannot blame on stupidity or short-sightedness. </p><p>I admit that calling it \u201cwrong\u201d or even \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d is a bit of misnomer. What I am trying to get at is the character going into a direction where the audience cannot and should not easily follow. Those actions would be too alien as might be their rationalizations. These actions should strike the audience as questionable, reprehensible, immoral, unethical, or dishonorable.</p><p>A perhaps too perfect example of such an action is Cersei firing up the Sept. It\u2019s mass murder and it\u2019s intended by her to be mass murder. If anyone in the audience found it not reprehensible and immoral, I would have some questions for these people.</p><p>But Cersei firing up the Sept was a success. Her survival was at stake - and she survived. Before her kingdom was full of powerful enemies and afterwards it wasn\u2019t. And she even snatched the Iron Throne afterwards despite having no royal Targaryen or Baratheon ancestry.</p><p>In realpolitik terms, Cersei made the \u201cright\u201d choice. All other choices would have lead to her death. The first rule of anything is that you cannot do anything if you\u2019re dead.</p><p>And frankly, that\u2019s a lesson Jon desperately needs to learn. His twice-tried strategy of rushing alone against an army of his enemies is idiotic. It might be honorable for a war leader to be the first person on the battlefield but it\u2019s not a winning war strategy.</p><p>It\u2019s not a nice thing to say, but it\u2019s necessary for a war time general or commander to be willing to have other people die for him and his goal. And not just for him but in front of him, literally shielding him. An army commander who isn\u2019t willing to ensure his own survival, is gambling with such terrible odds that he has already lost the war. </p><p>Cersei\u2019s strategy of killing her enemies instead of allowing herself to be killed is profoundly wrong, immoral and yet Jon needs understand that when mankind\u2019s survival are at stake an immoral action like that might be a necessary choice.</p><p>His attempt to drown in an ice lake alone is a sign that at this point he hasn\u2019t understood the necessity of being alive to lead a war at all. As George S. Patton put it: \u201cno poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb son-of-a-bitching bastard die for his country.\u201d</p><p>Out of all our main protagonists, Jon has never been willing to play as dirty as it should be necessary for an apocalyptic fight such as his. Unlike Sansa\u2019s willingness to go along with Littlefinger\u2019s nefarious plans for her cousin in the Vale, Arya\u2019s willingness to kill potentially innocent people for the Faceless Men, Tyrion raping a prostitute and killing Shae, the torture of innocents during Dany\u2019s Slavers\u2019s Bay arc, Bran warging Hodor\u2026 Jon has nothing in his arc that is as dark, dishonorable or questionable as these things. Jon appears to be a character class apart, like the hero of a more classic fantasy epic.</p><p>Is this because Jon\u2019s so special that his arc is a whole different genre or is this because he hasn\u2019t leveled up in realpolitik yet?</p><p>Or is there perhaps even a third option to deal with his relative over-the-top good guy characterization?</p><p>***</p><p>You know, when it comes to stories about morality like Game of Thrones a crucial factor for their success is not just the quality of the good guys but also the quality of the villains.</p><p>And what makes a compelling villain?</p><p>IMO, they hit more than one of these characteristics:</p><p>1. They are well-rounded, fully realized characters, drawn with the same care as the heroes.</p><p>2. They are able to win against the good guys. They are not a cardboard that will be blown over once the heroes wave a magic stick or sword around.</p><p>3. Their evil deeds get an emotional reaction out of the audience. (Most audiences tend to have a vague discomfort with CGI mass carnage while reacting to a well-executed scene of high school bullying with actual empathy or even horror.)</p><p>4. Their motivations are understandable, perhaps even sympathetic. At best they are a well-intentioned extremist, utilitarianism gone wrong, rather than setting stuff on fire because their mom was mean to them once.</p><p>Now looking at this list, it becomes obvious that GOT has a problem with its current crop of villains. Any of the three that are left (Cersei, the Night King, Euron) could be the Final Boss \u2013 to use a video game term. But none of them are very compelling villains. Two of them are inhuman monsters. To call their characterization shallow would be an insult to puddles. </p><p>And Cersei, the only one with a decent characterization (and some past Mean Girls bullying sins of her own) suffers from being incredibly stupid in the books, having a prophecy running against her and stealing Aegon from Essos\u2019 story in the show. In other words, Cersei\u2019s chances of success and survival and actually making it this far in the books are as good as that of a snowflake on a hot summer\u2019s day. One suspects that she is a show-only final-ish villain, so if one looks for GRRM\u2019s final-ish villains, they would not find Cersei.<br></p><p>Talking about chances of success \u2013 the Night King isn\u2019t winning this either. Because then ASOIAF would reveal itself to be a nihilistic mess in which all the human storylines were nothing but shaggydog stories. So the Night King is \u00a0bound to melt in the summer sun along with Cersei. There is little question about it. And is Euron \u201cwas he even mentioned in the first book?\u201d Greyjoy \u00a0really going to win the Iron Throne in the end? Is anyone taking this possibility seriously?</p><p>And what are their motivations? Ambition, being evil and being anti-human. None of them are particularly sympathetic.</p><p>In one word, GOT\u2019s current crop of villains is not particularly exciting \u2013 especially if you compare them with some of the villains that came before them. And if one of these three is the Final Boss, he or she is gonna be lame.</p><p>But a lame Final Boss is actually a great tradition in the genre. In Lord of the Rings Sauron appears to be literally two-dimensional and about as interesting as a character. (Gollum gets to be the well-written villain and he is doing very little damage to the world at large.) Voldemort in Harry Potter is completely outshone as the most despised, scary villain of the series by the one-book-wonder Dolores Umbridge who excels at committing low-key evil deeds that make every reader/viewer wince in sympathy. The Emperor in the original Star Wars trilogy is\u2026 there and then dead and has fewer fans than a one-line bounty hunter. And the same fans that endlessly shout \u201cHan shot first\u201d, don\u2019t even appear to care that he got a complete face replacement in the Special Editions. And if there is one consistent complaint about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it\u2019s that its villains tend to be boring and forgettable. Yet they\u2019re lame and forgettable to the tune of billions of box office dollars.</p><p>So a lame Final Boss for the heroes to fight\u2026 that is indeed a thing. And that might be just the thing GOT/ASOIAF is doing. This is what we have to seriously consider. We are likely to get a MCU villain\u2026 you know on the level of Ronan the Destroyer or Malekith, the Dark Elf. And you probably need to google in which movies those two turned up.</p><p>That would be a terrible let down.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s not actually that terrible of a thing? Because if our final boss and villain is not Cersei, the Night King, or Euron, it\u2019s a good guy gone bad. Someone who is currently fighting on the side of the living before becoming someone who needs to be fought.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that this is in the cards. After \u201cOzymandias\u201d, the penultimate episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, aired, GRRM wrote on his blog that \u201cWalter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros, I need to do something about that.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The thing is that White appeared to start out as a sympathetic if flawed hero you were rooting for even as he was making meth. What made White monstrous is not doing depraved psycho shit beyond comprehension (like nailing a living, pregnant woman to a ship like Euron Greyjoy) but that he appears to evolve into this monster before the audience\u2019s eyes. </p><p><i>Breaking Bad</i> tricks the audience into liking a character for much longer than he ever deserved and that becomes crystal clear in that penultimate episode. If GRRM wants a monster like White he can\u2019t use his old, repetitive trick of making a one-dimensional psychopath do depraved stuff. He has to logically progress a character we root for into a monster.</p><p>(Of course, GRRM might also not be able to pull it off, however much he wants to. It could be that he has not prepared the ground to make a main character go Walter White and thus it will always fall short of Breaking Bad\u2019s accomplishment. Sure, Greyworm or Dolorous Edd could become evil and monstrous but even GRRM should know that\u2019s not quite the same as making your main protagonist evil.</p><p>I might also be wrong on GRRM understanding what makes Walter White feel so monstrous. The first big sign that White took the road down to hell is not an act of murder or sadism but simply not helping someone who is choking to death. His monstrosity is based in a three-dimensional characterization, not in particularly outrageous acts of evil. He is monstrous because he used to be likable. If GRRM doesn\u2019t see that, he might actually think that one-dimensional psychopath Euron nailing his pregnant girlfriend to a ship is nailing the same kind of monstrosity.</p><p>He also could be talking about a plot point we now know about but that he has not published yet \u2013 like Stannis burning Shireen. So one should be careful looking for ASOIAF\u2019s Walter White.)</p><p>Interestingly enough, the trick <i>Breaking Bad</i> is pulling is quite old. White isn\u2019t making meth by chance, it was the worst thing his creator could think of besides him becoming an arms dealer. The twist of Breaking Bad\u2019s \u201cOzymandias\u201d is actually not that White becomes bad but that he has always been bad. You\u2019ll find a similar character in Humbert Humbert in Nabokov\u2019s <i>Lolita</i> where his monstrosity is barely a plot twist and even Milton\u2019s <i>Paradise Lost</i> where it\u2019s none at all. (The trope of the protagonist being a piece of shit throughout the whole story usually goes down as \u201cvillain protagonist\u201d and the list of stories containing one is pretty expansive.) But the plot twist of a surprise villain protagonist is such an old one that Aesop already codified it in his fable \u201cThe Farmer and the Viper\u201d around 600 B.C. (Farmer helps harmless looking viper, then viper bites him because it\u2019s a viper. And has been a viper all along. Duh.)</p><p>Now if Dany, for example, turned into a villain then she would fall squarely into villain protagonist territory. But the fun thing is that doesn\u2019t mean that she is already one. The viper is not a villain until Aesop has it biting the farmer. If Dany decides to slaughter her future subjects by the thousands just so she can have the Iron Throne (and this is portrayed as despicable) then this will be in line with the Dany from the first season/AGoT who wanted the Dothraki to wage their type of warfare (pillaging, raping, enslaving, killing) onto thousands of her future subjects, so she could have the Iron Throne. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Dany will cross this particular moral event horizon.</p><p>Whether Dany will turn out to be a villain protagonist is not a question of foreshadowing. It\u2019s a question whether the authorial intent will will it into existence. The viper is a poisonous snake but if the author hasn\u2019t it biting the farmer, that poison doesn\u2019t matter at all.</p><p>Now Dany is a well-rounded character (same as Cersei) and might be difficult to defeat but her most likely, hypothetical, evil deed (mass carnage via dragon) is not particularly compelling and neither is ambition as her motivation. Villainous Dany is about as compelling as Cersei. Keeping Cersei for so long when there is Villainous Dany in the wings strikes me as a weak narrative choice:\u00a0\u201cMeet your new villain, same as the old villain\u2026\u201d The difference would be the element of surprise but that\u2019s a paltry surprise, especially since Villainous Dany was supposed to be The Big Plot Twist. <br></p><p>Honestly, Dany as the mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain is a low-hanging fruit. Call me edgy, but it\u2019s just nowhere near \u201cOzymandias\u201d. It\u2019s Boromir getting seduced by the Ring.</p><p>And there are not a lot of precedents for that storyline in ASOIAF. You know the story of a good guy gone beyond redemption evil. There is Theon, whose ambition, jealousy and insecurity drove him into sacking Winterfell and killing two children \u2013 but even he turned out to be not to be beyond redemption. There is Catelyn, but she goes crazy and becomes a zombie, so it\u2019s hard to compare.</p><p>But there is, of course, the most compelling, interesting and meaningful character arc of a good guy gone bad: Stannis Baratheon. But he isn\u2019t a good precedent for a mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain.<br></p><p>***</p><p>You see, Stannis starts out as not exactly the most sympathetic character: he burns people and places of worship, he is a religious nut, he has his brother killed. But after getting defeating at the Battle of Blackwater, his arc does a 180. He gets the call from the North to save the realm, and out of all of the five Kings involved in the war of the same name, he is the only one he realizes that in order to \u201cwin the realm, you have to save the realm.\u201d</p><p>That isn\u2019t a coincidence. Stannis is also the only king who fights for a higher purpose. Joffrey, Balon, Robb, and Renly just fight for power (be it the power over all of Westeros or the power that lies in independence). Stannis is fighting not just for power but also for his religion, for his one true god; he is fighting a crusade. That out of all the kings, the king who believes that his religion will save Westeros ends up wanting to save it from a supernatural threat is not a coincidence. One thing clearly causes the other.</p><p>And once he makes this choice, Stannis, the Mannis (as he was lovingly called by his fans once upon a time) always fights the bad guys, he fights for the living. Of course, he doesn\u2019t stop being a religious nut, he doesn\u2019t stop burning people, he is inflexible in his beliefs, he still thinks he is the chosen one, he is Azor Ahai, he is the One True King, he belongs on the Iron Throne. But he is also the man who executes soldiers of his army who rape. He has good sides. But what weighs so heavily in his favor is that out of all the people in power in Westeros, he is fighting the bad guys.</p><p>And that matters \u2013 until it doesn\u2019t when Stannis strikes out to fight the Boltons. The Boltons are special because they are despicable without exceptions. Even the Freys have Robb\u2019s squire in their midst to have that one decent family member/bannerman that all of Westeros\u2019 notable houses appear to have. All but the Boltons anyway. There is not a good or decent living Bolton. They are the literal worst Westeros has to offer.</p><p>And yet, Stannis manages to cross a moral event horizon that makes everyone forget that he is doing it to fight the Worst. And that moral event horizon is not the sacking of a city, the killing of hundred of thousands. He is not extinguishing a house or a people. He manages it, doing something every single GOT character could do right now (save for little Sam.) He kills a single person.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t come back from that. Like a proper Ozymandias, his hubris, his pretension to predestined, prophecied greatness is followed by his inevitable decline. Killing Shireen has Stannis losing his real world fans and his in-story followers, his wife, his fight, his priestess, his army, his purpose and consequently his life. He proves very quickly that not all ends justify all means. He is the living embodiment of the Friedrich Nietzsche quotation that \u201cthose who fight monsters should take care that in the process they do not become monsters themselves.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Stannis\u2019 final turn into villainy is actually paralleled by something another character does in ASOIAF. Except he is not a character we meet; he is a story-within-a-story; a legend, a prophecy or both. He is who Stannis thought he was: he is Azor Ahai. <br></p><p><br></p><p>And Azor Ahai absolutely does what Stannis did to turn into a villain, a monster: he murders\u2026 sacrifices an innocent to forge Lightbringer to end the Long Night. The way the story gets told makes that murder necessary, but Azor Ahai as the hero and winner of the Long Night gets to tell that story, gets to tell history his way. It\u2019s a legend and of course Azor Ahai is its hero. But remember the first person who claimed that \u201conly death can pay for life\u201d was a liar who wanted to make sure that \u201cThe Stallion Who Mounts the World\u201d died in the womb. (The second was Melisandre who tends to be wrong on a lot of things and whose track record on human sacrifice is abysmal.)</p><p>So there is absolutely a chance that Nissa Nissa\u2019s death was as necessary as Shireen\u2019s. We won\u2019t get the opportunity to fact-check the legend, the ancient history. But if it\u2019s a prophecy we might see its reality. </p><p>Of course, if GOT really goes the way of making a good guy go bad, then they can do this the middling way, the mediocre way. Theon\u2019s Sack of Winterfell Redux or Catelyn\u2019s descent into madness and murder. Or by making Dany a villain protagonist who is basically just another Cersei with dragons. And despite not quite measuring up to Stannis\u2019 dark turn \u2013 ambition, grief, fear, insecurity, jealousy, vanity, or disappointment leading to mass carnage delivered onto a hundred-thousand computer-generated extras is still more interesting than the Night King Sauron with his ice dragon. </p><p><br></p><p>But the reality is that we don\u2019t care about the 100,000 inhabitants of King\u2019s Landing. We will cry over a single Hot Pie before ever giving a fuck about a massive number of fictional people without any characteristics. Mass carnage is easy to oppose morally because it\u2019s something we oppose in real life but emotionally there is no difference between 10 fictional people or a billion fictional people \u2013 if they are simply there to be nameless, featureless cannon fodder. The ability to cause mass carnage doesn\u2019t make you the most emotionally effective villain by default. Quite the opposite. </p><p>If Bran were to warg a dragon and set King\u2019s Landing on fire, we would get that this whole Three-Eyed Raven thing didn\u2019t work out well for his ethics and be, like, \u201cokay\u201d. If Bran set fire to Arya, he would immediately become the most hated character ever on GOT. (And that isn\u2019t an exaggeration for effect). And any good intentions regarding defeating evil would matter as much as the fight against the Boltons did once Shireen started screaming. </p><p>I would like to add that Stannis died pretty much immediately after killing Shireen, blown over like a cardboard once Brienne showed up. But who would defeat or want to defeat a Stannis, an Azor Ahai who succeeded at ending the Long Night?</p><p>The ultimate story subversion when it comes to the classic \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d plot is that the bad guy wins.</p><p> And wouldn\u2019t that be something if it was surprise villain protagonist? We get someone winning that we would have been okay with winning until they turned into GOT\u2019s least liked character? Wouldn\u2019t that be bittersweet? Getting who you were okay with, perhaps even wanted on the Iron Throne, who might even know which is the right tax plan and what to do with baby orcs\u2026 \u00a0except they suck now?</p><p>Now who could that true Azor Ahai possibly be?</p><p>Is there someone who has been fighting monsters longer than anyone else has? Who has been so corrupted by that fight that he has tried and sacrificed already everything he could and had to defeat them? A man on quasi-religious crusade? A man who has the sort of righteous hubris and single-minded focus on the White Walkers that makes him often deaf to good advice? Who who has already laid down his life for a chance\u2026 and even a \u201cno-chance-at-all-now-let-me-drown-in-an-ice-lake\u201d at defeating the Night King? Is this possibly the same guy who we think is going to be crucial to the defeat of the White Walkers? \u00a0The one who has the perfect bloodline to claim the Iron Throne in the end? The one who is shown to Melisandre when she looks for her prophecied chosen one in the fire? The one who appears to be the straight hero of the story, the Luke Skywalker, the only major character where pulling a Stannis would actually shock us? \u00a0The one who has never been \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d?</p><p>I am not saying, we are getting \u201cAegon, the Worst of His Name\u201d. I am saying that if I wanted to create a villain who subverts all expectations while fulfilling them, a villain who is truly compelling and whose turn emotionally wrecks the audience, I would not make it happen by having Daenerys or Bran roast King\u2019s Landing. I simply would choose a more likable and successful version of Stannis and have him doing something terrible, wrongfully believing it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Now theoretically this could be anyone but little Sam. And regardless of that character\u2019s identity, they would be a great, compelling villain. Practically though, the best candidate for going off that particular deep end is not some random second tier character. And it\u2019s not Daenerys \u201cWhat Even Are White Walkers?\u201d or Bran \u201cI\u2019m <strike>a robotic, omniscient plot device now</strike> the Three-Eyed Raven now\u201d Stark either. </p><p>It\u2019s Jon. </p><p>***</p><p>There is an issue with this though. Stannis murdering a family member/sacrificing a child for their royal blood to win a battle was simply a continuation of Stannis\u2019 previous actions. Stannis had no issue with his wife\u2019s uncle being burned as a sacrifice to R'hllor, had his brother murdered to win a battle, and attempted to have his underage nephew (Edric Storm in the books, Gendry in the show) sacrificed for his royal blood.</p><p>Killing Shireen is Stannis taking this to its logical extreme. Everything he does is simply something he has done before. Except this time the audience isn\u2019t given an out: Shireen doesn\u2019t escape like Edric/Gendry, we care for her (unlike Alester Florent) and she isn\u2019t Stannis\u2019 opponent in battle (Renly).</p><p>What Stannis is doing, is not surprising or entirely unprecedented. It is ultimately just a darker twist on something he has done before. Which is weird because you would think that something that crosses a moral event horizon would be a real departure from his previous actions. But it\u2019s not and that is really crucial if we want to discuss Stannis 2.0.</p><p>If a good character goes bad then having them simply do something they\u2019ve done before \u2013 \u00a0except this time it\u2019s just too much \u2013 makes sense. Just like the road to hell is paved with good intentions, escalating villainy should be a slippery slope of ever indefensible bad deeds.</p><p>And this is why it makes no sense to look at Jon and wonder who he is going to burn at the stake for R'hllor \u2013 because he won\u2019t. \u00a0What he would do to incur the audience\u2019s disdain needs to be something he has kind of done before. And that he has done on the show before, because it stands to reason that the show would want to keep its foreshadowing. (Hence Gendry\u2019s slightly pointless kidnapping by Melisandre in the show.)</p><p>So the the baby swap is out since it didn\u2019t happen on the show. Breaking a vow is a bit too generic and on its lonesome will not evoke any emotional reaction. And making high-handed, impulsive decisions that end up with terrible consequences has been already done with Jon making a series of high-handed, badly thought through decisions that netted the Night King a dragon and destroyed the Wall and yet netted Jon no audience disdain at all. So probably not that one either.</p><p>That leaves his relationship with Ygritte. In the books, we only see this relationship from Jon\u2019s point of view with all his justifications and inner struggles and his self-knowledge that while he lies about his allegiance to the Wildlings\u2019 cause, his feelings for Ygritte are real.</p><p>Now if one imagines that relationship from Ygritte\u2019s point of view (as she is in the books), Jon would come out of that as a supreme douchebag. He lead her on, lied to her, pretended to have feelings for her, then left her, publicly humiliated her and finally participated in a battle with her on the other side. Jon doesn\u2019t kill her but he is willing to do so by fighting her. </p><p>Now a real neutral point of view that doesn\u2019t vilify Ygritte to prop up Jon as a cool dude (as the show has done with her allying herself with cannibals and the village massacre), would be more of a wash, ethically speaking. Jon lies to Ygritte but his life is at stake and it wasn\u2019t even his own idea in the first place. There are consent issues with their relationship and Ygritte is as willing to kill Jon when she participates in that battle as it\u2019s the case the other way around.</p><p>But then Stannis wasn\u2019t that unjustified to go after Renly who was willing to fight and kill him in battle after all. Killing Renly nearly rates as self-defense. And Edric Storm got away. The question is not how horrible Jon\u2019s actions towards Ygritte were. But rather what the escalation of that sort of overall action would be like.</p><p>Now due to time constraints the only relationship where Jon could pull an escalated \u201cYgritte\u201d is his relationship with Daenerys. And here I am kind of puzzled by the discourse around the idea. Because as passionately as people argue about it, they actually agree quite fundamentally: that Jon is doing it/not doing because he is the quintessential good guy. </p><p>That he either betrays his lover or the plutocratic will of his nation is disregarded as some sort of higher purpose collateral that doesn\u2019t at all reflect on his moral character.</p><p>But isn\u2019t Occam\u2019s Razor to the question of how a \u201cgood guy\u201d manages to betray either lover or nation simply to question the \u201cgood guy\u201d part?</p><p>But let\u2019s step back a bit. The theory that Jon is playing Dany proposes that Jon initiates this emotional manipulation because she wonders aloud about two things (while he wants her commitment on the fight against the White Walkers): 1. Her ability to achieve her overall strategic goal of winning the Iron Throne 2. What happens to her rear if she pulls all of her forces north.</p><p>Now, Jon never actually answers any of these questions (or any questions on how to get the Northern Lords to remain loyal to him and Dany) and that is a bit problematic. Because the second question of what happens in a war if you leave one side open to your enemies is an enormously important one.</p><p>What Jon appears to do, is rely on a truism about the North: that it cannot be conquered in Winter (and Winter is here.)</p><p>*beleaguered sigh*</p><p>This truism exists in our world about two countries. One is considered unconquerable in Winter, the other unconquerable in general. And while these truisms have held true for few centuries now, the reality is that attempts to conquer them have devastated both countries on more than one occasion to the sound of millions of dead inhabitants and bombing it to the bottom of the HDI.</p><p>If Jon relies on Winter to protect him and his allies from Cersei, he is an idiot. If Cersei attacks the unprotected North from the South, his ability to fight the White Walkers will be profoundly diminished even if Cersei fails at conquering the North itself. Dany is right to ask this question and he is wrong to ignore it. </p><p>And if that theory pans out and Jon took these strategic, legitimate concerns as a sign that he needs to loverboy it up instead of thinking how to protect the North from the South, then that\u2019s next level mansplaining. <br></p><p>But forget that point for a bit and go back to the situation in which Jon supposedly initiates it. He is recovering after the Wight Hunt and Dany swears to avenge her dragon while musing on her overall strategy of winning Westeros. And while Jon isn\u2019t in good shape, he is not in mortal danger. Not in general, not specifically by Dany. She is letting her hair down and she\u2019s pledging her support to his cause. </p><p>Jon\u2019s life is not the least on the line and the question whether Dany would or would not have pulled out of the war against the White Walkers if Jon hadn\u2019t started flirting with her in that moment is an unanswerable hypothetical. No matter how you slice or dice it, it\u2019s not certain at all (not to the audience, not to Jon) that she would have pulled out. </p><p>So Jon had three choices in this moment: not initiate a romantic relationship with Dany, initiate a romantic relationship out of genuine feeling, initiate a romantic relationship to manipulate her. </p><p>None of these choices would spell certain doom. It\u2019s not at all like the relationship with Ygritte, where not going along with it would have blown his cover and cost his life. It\u2019s also distinct from that situation insofar as he didn\u2019t choose to go undercover with the Wildlings in the first place but was commanded into the situation by his superior officer.</p><p>If Jon initiated the relationship to manipulate Dany, he chose to do this voluntarily without true necessity. It\u2019s, in fact, as necessary as Littlefinger manipulating Lysa into intrigue, murder and ill-fated marriage was. Of course, without that manipulation Littlefinger would have never advanced at court and become Master of the Coin, Lord of Harrenhall and Sweetrobin\u2019s guardian. But none of these things were necessary to grant his survival at any time.</p><p>The key difference between Jon and Littlefinger is that Jon allies himself with Dany to ensure mankind\u2019s survival instead of personal gain. But on the balance, another difference between Littlefinger and Jon\u2019s situation is that the romantic relationship wasn\u2019t necessary to ensure Dany\u2019s support. In fact, even the idea that Dany\u2019s concerns are sign of her wavering in her commitment is a minority if not fringe opinion among GOT\u2019s audience.</p><p>And that makes the idea of Jon manipulating Dany very unpalatable. The lack of necessity makes him a Littlefinger, rather than a Robb or a Ned or even the Jon who lied to Ygritte. And audiences prefer to see their heroes as honorable fools rather than manipulative, emotionally abusive jerks.</p><p>Because there is the heart of the problem. If Jon is truly manipulating Dany, he is an emotionally abusive jerk. He is profoundly wrong. He is the guy that your BFF has warned you about. \u201cHe is just using you for [something.]\u201d</p><p>And that hits home in a way shadowbabies and Frey Pies and Qyburn doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t know any necromancers who vivisect people. But we know the kind of jerk that Jon would be. It\u2019s not theoretical, it\u2019s something we know and because of that will not appreciate.</p><p>***</p><p>But while this absolutely checks off\u00a0\u201cmake the evil deed painful to the audience\u201d point in the \u201ccompelling villain\u201d check list, it\u2019s still nowhere near as ethically questionable as Stannis burning Shireen. <br></p><p>But Jon\u2019s Ygritte storyline doesn\u2019t end with him duping, betraying and leaving her. It ends with her getting killed. And not just killed, but killed in battle against Jon and his brothers. While Jon is not directly responsible for her death \u2013 he neither instigated nor executed the killing \u2013 he was willing to risk that his actions would kill her in that battle. The goal of a battle is to win and to use the Patton quote from above \u201cmake the other bastard die for his country.\u201d Of course, Jon acted in self-defense, Ygritte was fighting that battle against him and the NW voluntarily, fully willing, ready and able to kill him.</p><p>But then, to go back to Stannis, Stannis was also just acting in self-defense when he send the shadowbaby assassin to kill Renly. Renly had the superior force and showed himself fully willing, ready and able to kill Stannis in battle. The question whether Stannis\u2019 assassination of Renly is justified is a digression too far because that is not the point. The point is that Jon and Stannis got some person killed who was really close to them (brother, lover) and that was kind of, maybe, perhaps justified self-defense. You can argue for it in both cases. </p><p>However, as I mentioned before, Stannis\u2019 ultimate escalation of Renly\u2019s murder is killing Shireen. There is no maybe, perhaps, kind of, about the lack of justification for it. Stannis did not act in self-defense, Stannis was not provoked. The true necessity was also absent\u2026 although the proof for that is just hindsight. The sacrifice was supposed to save Stannis and his army. It did not. Thus it was never necessary. The whole thing is just wholly indefensible.</p><p>Now would an escalation of Jon\u2019s Ygritte storyline limit itself to the affair and betrayal or would it go all the way down to that self-defensive arrow that Jon wasn\u2019t directly responsible for? Except for a Stannis-like escalation that arrow could not be self-defensive, it would have to be undeserved, unjustified, unnecessary <i>and</i> Jon\u2019s responsibility. </p><p>The audience doesn\u2019t even have to like Dany at that point. That would be just crossing all moral event horizons, turning Jon into a villain and serving a \u201c<strike>King Arthur</strike> <strike>Aragorn</strike> Jon \u00a0Snow is the final villain\u201d plot twist that makes R+L=J look like child\u2019s play in comparison. It would be truly an epic twist, ending up in the plot twist pantheon next to \u201cBruce is a ghost\u201d and \u201cSoylent Green\u201d.</p><p>However, I don\u2019t think this is gonna happen. A villain protagonist on that level would have been foreshadowed much, much more, both in the books and the show. \u201cThe villain wins\u201d is also really nihilistic and ends up on a quite bitter note with very little sweetness. Davos, Brienne and Sam emerging alone from the rubble would be a more positive and happier ending. It\u2019s also the sort of plot twist you think of five books and seven TV seasons later (too late), not when you conceive the story. <br></p><p><br></p><p>So what will happen to Jon instead if he doesn\u2019t become a villain?</p><p>There are really only two options: his characterization remains in a class of its own and he remains the only truly good guy protagonist or he takes a level in realpolitik and starts to play as dirty as necessary in whatever way. Not quite Jon, the villain but Jon the ethically challenged, Jon the Utilitarian. <br></p><p>(By the way, I am not saying that he has to play dirty with specific characters to qualify, just that that he has to play dirty somehow. In fact, playing dirty with certain characters might evoke a negative, emotional audience reaction that is not in proportion to the ethics violation it presents and thus the whole Utilitarianism bit might accidentally devolve into perceived villainy.)</p><p>The really fascinating bit about this is that Jon\u2019s characterization will define ASOIAF quite significantly. Jon is so crucial to the story\u2019s most fundamental conflict, that even if you discard the idea that he is <a href=\"http://blindestspot.tumblr.com/post/166182300140/aegon-his-is-the-song-of-ice-and-fire\">The Protagonist</a>, you would still have to agree that he is one of the most important protagonists. His characterization will contribute and lead to the resolution of that conflict. If he resolves it by playing dirty, the moral of the story will quite different than it is if he resolves it by always taking the heroic, high road. </p><p>And it\u2019s not just the moral of the story. Once the story decides to land on \u201cJon, the moral\u201d or \u201cJon, the Utilitarian\u201d, the question whether we are consuming \u201cLord of the Rings with boobs\u201d or a true deconstruction of Lord of the Rings will answer itself. And that will reflect on more than just Jon\u2019s storyline. If Jon stays heroic, Night King Sauron, our final, two-dimensional villain and other neat and flat resolutions become much more likely.</p><p>As such I would argue that the Jon\u2019s characterization will define how good ASOIAF\u2019s famed realism truly is, what ideals it propagates, and what kind of story ASOIAF is. </p><p>I honestly can\u2019t predict how this will play out. But I remember that Ned and the Red Wedding promised a deconstruction of the genre, an acknowledgement that taking the high road constantly can be a dead end in real life. Jon not needing to be smarter than them in the end would break that promise. <br></p>",

During that time I\u2019ve also managed to calm down about the inconsistent number of redshirts during the Wight Hunt. Yes, I remember that this was a thing that happened, along with a bunch of other dei ex machina, like Cersei\u2019s brilliant strategies for everything, Jon\u2019s repeated, increasingly dumb survivals and the whole Winterfell plot. </p><p>But calming down about them meant that I could think about Game of Thrones again in a manner that kind of naively assumes that the work is coherent . That 2+2=4, not 5, or orange, or a tiger. And this is what I think is going on with Jon and why it is so crucial to the whole work.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p><br></p><p>George R.R. Martin once said that <i>A Song of Ice and Fire </i>is supposed to \nhave a bittersweet ending. Now that phrase covers a lot of ground. A \nbittersweet ending might be just ASOIAF\u2019s Scouring of the Shire (which \nat this stage is assured) and a few good guys passing into the Great \nBeyond (also nearly certain) \u2013 which would be a copy of Lord of the \nRings. </p><p>A bittersweet ending might also be Davos, Brienne and Sam \nemerging alone from the rubble like the unhappy winners of a Battle \nRoyale. A few good guys surviving would technically make the ending not a\n complete downer and thus \u201cbittersweet\u201d.</p><p>However, a more nuanced \nlook at a bittersweet ending should look beyond mere survival and \ndestruction but at an ending that irrevocably changes the characters and\n how and what we think of them. </p><p>An issue that strikes readers as unrealistic about Lord of the Rings is\u00a0 that a lot of its human and hobbit-y heroes move on from the events of the story into psychologically very ordinary, uncomplicated lives that they would have lead even without the events of the story. Sam, Merry, Pippin\u2019s (and to a lesser degree Faramir, Aragorn and Eowyn\u2019s) easy passing into normalcy feels vaguely hollow.</p><p>If GRRM really plans to have a realistic take on Lord of the Rings and its \u201cbittersweet\u201d ending (and with his complaints about Aragorn\u2019s tax policy it appears that this is a crucial element of ASOIAF), then obviously he is going to continue what he has been doing all along and create an interplay between narrative events and characterization. Take Arya, for example. In the early parts of AGoT she would have not wanted to become a Faceless Man \u2013 for obvious reasons. But Arya from a few books later, after events have matured and traumatized her, wants to become one. And that choice will again impact her characterization and that will in turn impact future events. \u2028It is logical that this interplay will continue right up until the end. So speculation has to take into account that these characters are dynamic and can be pushed by events into new directions. And not just \u201ccan\u201d \u2013 but will be. </p><p>The question is not who will be alive to experience the Scoured Shire but who they will be at this point. And that change shouldn\u2019t just be cosmetic or physical, it needs to be psychological, visible, noticeable and profound. We shouldn\u2019t get an Aragorn who just walks into a kingship after a two battles, marries the cute elf girl and then doesn\u2019t have a tax plan. <br></p><p>And obviously, I am not talking about Gilly. I am very much talking about ASOIAF\u2019s Aragorn. I am talking about Jon.</p><p>\u2026<br></p><p>Now here is a hypothetical scenario for Season 8: Jon with the help of Dany and her dragons (and, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, the usual stock characters who fight every fictional war for us, even those in space), fight the White Walkers, win, then fight Cersei, then win (the order of this is might be reversed) and then Jon\u2019s revealed to be true heir and has to rebuild Westeros.</p><p>How does any of this really change and mature Jon as a character? How does being right about everything (the White Walkers being the real threat), then leading a righteous force to victory over evil make him a realistic take on Aragorn?</p><p>It doesn\u2019t.\u2028</p><p><br>What Jon needs after five books and seven season of making serviceable to great, sensible, ethical, right strategic choices (with admittedly a number of great tactical errors in between) is being wrong. And not just being wrong about failing to communicate to his sworn brothers what his strategy is, not just wrong about going on that Wight Hunt, not just wrong to send Sam away, not just lightly ethically challenged for exchanging a pair of babies against one mother\u2019s will or misleading his love interest on his commitment to her political cause\u2026 but wrong in a truly profound way that the audience cannot blame on stupidity or short-sightedness. </p><p>I admit that calling it \u201cwrong\u201d or even \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d is a bit of misnomer. What I am trying to get at is the character going into a direction where the audience cannot and should not easily follow. Those actions would be too alien as might be their rationalizations. These actions should strike the audience as questionable, reprehensible, immoral, unethical, or dishonorable.</p><p>A perhaps too perfect example of such an action is Cersei firing up the Sept. It\u2019s mass murder and it\u2019s intended by her to be mass murder. If anyone in the audience found it not reprehensible and immoral, I would have some questions for these people.</p><p>But Cersei firing up the Sept was a success. Her survival was at stake - and she survived. Before her kingdom was full of powerful enemies and afterwards it wasn\u2019t. And she even snatched the Iron Throne afterwards despite having no royal Targaryen or Baratheon ancestry.</p><p>In realpolitik terms, Cersei made the \u201cright\u201d choice. All other choices would have lead to her death. The first rule of anything is that you cannot do anything if you\u2019re dead.</p><p>And frankly, that\u2019s a lesson Jon desperately needs to learn. His twice-tried strategy of rushing alone against an army of his enemies is idiotic. It might be honorable for a war leader to be the first person on the battlefield but it\u2019s not a winning war strategy.</p><p>It\u2019s not a nice thing to say, but it\u2019s necessary for a war time general or commander to be willing to have other people die for him and his goal. And not just for him but in front of him, literally shielding him. An army commander who isn\u2019t willing to ensure his own survival, is gambling with such terrible odds that he has already lost the war. </p><p>Cersei\u2019s strategy of killing her enemies instead of allowing herself to be killed is profoundly wrong, immoral and yet Jon needs understand that when mankind\u2019s survival are at stake an immoral action like that might be a necessary choice.</p><p>His attempt to drown in an ice lake alone is a sign that at this point he hasn\u2019t understood the necessity of being alive to lead a war at all. As George S. Patton put it: \u201cno poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb son-of-a-bitching bastard die for his country.\u201d</p><p>Out of all our main protagonists, Jon has never been willing to play as dirty as it should be necessary for an apocalyptic fight such as his. Unlike Sansa\u2019s willingness to go along with Littlefinger\u2019s nefarious plans for her cousin in the Vale, Arya\u2019s willingness to kill potentially innocent people for the Faceless Men, Tyrion raping a prostitute and killing Shae, the torture of innocents during Dany\u2019s Slavers\u2019s Bay arc, Bran warging Hodor\u2026 Jon has nothing in his arc that is as dark, dishonorable or questionable as these things. Jon appears to be a character class apart, like the hero of a more classic fantasy epic.</p><p>Is this because Jon\u2019s so special that his arc is a whole different genre or is this because he hasn\u2019t leveled up in realpolitik yet?</p><p>Or is there perhaps even a third option to deal with his relative over-the-top good guy characterization?</p><p>***</p><p>You know, when it comes to stories about morality like Game of Thrones a crucial factor for their success is not just the quality of the good guys but also the quality of the villains.</p><p>And what makes a compelling villain?</p><p>IMO, they hit more than one of these characteristics:</p><p>1. They are well-rounded, fully realized characters, drawn with the same care as the heroes.</p><p>2. They are able to win against the good guys. They are not a cardboard that will be blown over once the heroes wave a magic stick or sword around.</p><p>3. Their evil deeds get an emotional reaction out of the audience. (Most audiences tend to have a vague discomfort with CGI mass carnage while reacting to a well-executed scene of high school bullying with actual empathy or even horror.)</p><p>4. Their motivations are understandable, perhaps even sympathetic. At best they are a well-intentioned extremist, utilitarianism gone wrong, rather than setting stuff on fire because their mom was mean to them once.</p><p>Now looking at this list, it becomes obvious that GOT has a problem with its current crop of villains. Any of the three that are left (Cersei, the Night King, Euron) could be the Final Boss \u2013 to use a video game term. But none of them are very compelling villains. Two of them are inhuman monsters. To call their characterization shallow would be an insult to puddles. </p><p>And Cersei, the only one with a decent characterization (and some past Mean Girls bullying sins of her own) suffers from being incredibly stupid in the books, having a prophecy running against her and stealing Aegon from Essos\u2019 story in the show. In other words, Cersei\u2019s chances of success and survival and actually making it this far in the books are as good as that of a snowflake on a hot summer\u2019s day. One suspects that she is a show-only final-ish villain, so if one looks for GRRM\u2019s final-ish villains, they would not find Cersei.<br></p><p>Talking about chances of success \u2013 the Night King isn\u2019t winning this either. Because then ASOIAF would reveal itself to be a nihilistic mess in which all the human storylines were nothing but shaggydog stories. So the Night King is \u00a0bound to melt in the summer sun along with Cersei. There is little question about it. And is Euron \u201cwas he even mentioned in the first book?\u201d Greyjoy \u00a0really going to win the Iron Throne in the end? Is anyone taking this possibility seriously?</p><p>And what are their motivations? Ambition, being evil and being anti-human. None of them are particularly sympathetic.</p><p>In one word, GOT\u2019s current crop of villains is not particularly exciting \u2013 especially if you compare them with some of the villains that came before them. And if one of these three is the Final Boss, he or she is gonna be lame.</p><p>But a lame Final Boss is actually a great tradition in the genre. In Lord of the Rings Sauron appears to be literally two-dimensional and about as interesting as a character. (Gollum gets to be the well-written villain and he is doing very little damage to the world at large.) Voldemort in Harry Potter is completely outshone as the most despised, scary villain of the series by the one-book-wonder Dolores Umbridge who excels at committing low-key evil deeds that make every reader/viewer wince in sympathy. The Emperor in the original Star Wars trilogy is\u2026 there and then dead and has fewer fans than a one-line bounty hunter. And the same fans that endlessly shout \u201cHan shot first\u201d, don\u2019t even appear to care that he got a complete face replacement in the Special Editions. And if there is one consistent complaint about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it\u2019s that its villains tend to be boring and forgettable. Yet they\u2019re lame and forgettable to the tune of billions of box office dollars.</p><p>So a lame Final Boss for the heroes to fight\u2026 that is indeed a thing. And that might be just the thing GOT/ASOIAF is doing. This is what we have to seriously consider. We are likely to get a MCU villain\u2026 you know on the level of Ronan the Destroyer or Malekith, the Dark Elf. And you probably need to google in which movies those two turned up.</p><p>That would be a terrible let down.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s not actually that terrible of a thing? Because if our final boss and villain is not Cersei, the Night King, or Euron, it\u2019s a good guy gone bad. Someone who is currently fighting on the side of the living before becoming someone who needs to be fought.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that this is in the cards. After \u201cOzymandias\u201d, the penultimate episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, aired, GRRM wrote on his blog that \u201cWalter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros, I need to do something about that.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The thing is that White appeared to start out as a sympathetic if flawed hero you were rooting for even as he was making meth. What made White monstrous is not doing depraved psycho shit beyond comprehension (like nailing a living, pregnant woman to a ship like Euron Greyjoy) but that he appears to evolve into this monster before the audience\u2019s eyes. </p><p><i>Breaking Bad</i> tricks the audience into liking a character for much longer than he ever deserved and that becomes crystal clear in that penultimate episode. If GRRM wants a monster like White he can\u2019t use his old, repetitive trick of making a one-dimensional psychopath do depraved stuff. He has to logically progress a character we root for into a monster.</p><p>(Of course, GRRM might also not be able to pull it off, however much he wants to. It could be that he has not prepared the ground to make a main character go Walter White and thus it will always fall short of Breaking Bad\u2019s accomplishment. Sure, Greyworm or Dolorous Edd could become evil and monstrous but even GRRM should know that\u2019s not quite the same as making your main protagonist evil.</p><p>I might also be wrong on GRRM understanding what makes Walter White feel so monstrous. The first big sign that White took the road down to hell is not an act of murder or sadism but simply not helping someone who is choking to death. His monstrosity is based in a three-dimensional characterization, not in particularly outrageous acts of evil. He is monstrous because he used to be likable. If GRRM doesn\u2019t see that, he might actually think that one-dimensional psychopath Euron nailing his pregnant girlfriend to a ship is nailing the same kind of monstrosity.</p><p>He also could be talking about a plot point we now know about but that he has not published yet \u2013 like Stannis burning Shireen. So one should be careful looking for ASOIAF\u2019s Walter White.)</p><p>Interestingly enough, the trick <i>Breaking Bad</i> is pulling is quite old. White isn\u2019t making meth by chance, it was the worst thing his creator could think of besides him becoming an arms dealer. The twist of Breaking Bad\u2019s \u201cOzymandias\u201d is actually not that White becomes bad but that he has always been bad. You\u2019ll find a similar character in Humbert Humbert in Nabokov\u2019s <i>Lolita</i> where his monstrosity is barely a plot twist and even Milton\u2019s <i>Paradise Lost</i> where it\u2019s none at all. (The trope of the protagonist being a piece of shit throughout the whole story usually goes down as \u201cvillain protagonist\u201d and the list of stories containing one is pretty expansive.) But the plot twist of a surprise villain protagonist is such an old one that Aesop already codified it in his fable \u201cThe Farmer and the Viper\u201d around 600 B.C. (Farmer helps harmless looking viper, then viper bites him because it\u2019s a viper. And has been a viper all along. Duh.)</p><p>Now if Dany, for example, turned into a villain then she would fall squarely into villain protagonist territory. But the fun thing is that doesn\u2019t mean that she is already one. The viper is not a villain until Aesop has it biting the farmer. If Dany decides to slaughter her future subjects by the thousands just so she can have the Iron Throne (and this is portrayed as despicable) then this will be in line with the Dany from the first season/AGoT who wanted the Dothraki to wage their type of warfare (pillaging, raping, enslaving, killing) onto thousands of her future subjects, so she could have the Iron Throne. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Dany will cross this particular moral event horizon.</p><p>Whether Dany will turn out to be a villain protagonist is not a question of foreshadowing. It\u2019s a question whether the authorial intent will will it into existence. The viper is a poisonous snake but if the author hasn\u2019t it biting the farmer, that poison doesn\u2019t matter at all.</p><p>Now Dany is a well-rounded character (same as Cersei) and might be difficult to defeat but her most likely, hypothetical, evil deed (mass carnage via dragon) is not particularly compelling and neither is ambition as her motivation. Villainous Dany is about as compelling as Cersei. Keeping Cersei for so long when there is Villainous Dany in the wings strikes me as a weak narrative choice:\u00a0\u201cMeet your new villain, same as the old villain\u2026\u201d The difference would be the element of surprise but that\u2019s a paltry surprise, especially since Villainous Dany was supposed to be The Big Plot Twist. <br></p><p>Honestly, Dany as the mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain is a low-hanging fruit. Call me edgy, but it\u2019s just nowhere near \u201cOzymandias\u201d. It\u2019s Boromir getting seduced by the Ring.</p><p>And there are not a lot of precedents for that storyline in ASOIAF. You know the story of a good guy gone beyond redemption evil. There is Theon, whose ambition, jealousy and insecurity drove him into sacking Winterfell and killing two children \u2013 but even he turned out to be not to be beyond redemption. There is Catelyn, but she goes crazy and becomes a zombie, so it\u2019s hard to compare.</p><p>But there is, of course, the most compelling, interesting and meaningful character arc of a good guy gone bad: Stannis Baratheon. But he isn\u2019t a good precedent for a mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain.<br></p><p>***</p><p>You see, Stannis starts out as not exactly the most sympathetic character: he burns people and places of worship, he is a religious nut, he has his brother killed. But after getting defeating at the Battle of Blackwater, his arc does a 180. He gets the call from the North to save the realm, and out of all of the five Kings involved in the war of the same name, he is the only one he realizes that in order to \u201cwin the realm, you have to save the realm.\u201d</p><p>That isn\u2019t a coincidence. Stannis is also the only king who fights for a higher purpose. Joffrey, Balon, Robb, and Renly just fight for power (be it the power over all of Westeros or the power that lies in independence). Stannis is fighting not just for power but also for his religion, for his one true god; he is fighting a crusade. That out of all the kings, the king who believes that his religion will save Westeros ends up wanting to save it from a supernatural threat is not a coincidence. One thing clearly causes the other.</p><p>And once he makes this choice, Stannis, the Mannis (as he was lovingly called by his fans once upon a time) always fights the bad guys, he fights for the living. Of course, he doesn\u2019t stop being a religious nut, he doesn\u2019t stop burning people, he is inflexible in his beliefs, he still thinks he is the chosen one, he is Azor Ahai, he is the One True King, he belongs on the Iron Throne. But he is also the man who executes soldiers of his army who rape. He has good sides. But what weighs so heavily in his favor is that out of all the people in power in Westeros, he is fighting the bad guys.</p><p>And that matters \u2013 until it doesn\u2019t when Stannis strikes out to fight the Boltons. The Boltons are special because they are despicable without exceptions. Even the Freys have Robb\u2019s squire in their midst to have that one decent family member/bannerman that all of Westeros\u2019 notable houses appear to have. All but the Boltons anyway. There is not a good or decent living Bolton. They are the literal worst Westeros has to offer.</p><p>And yet, Stannis manages to cross a moral event horizon that makes everyone forget that he is doing it to fight the Worst. And that moral event horizon is not the sacking of a city, the killing of hundred of thousands. He is not extinguishing a house or a people. He manages it, doing something every single GOT character could do right now (save for little Sam.) He kills a single person.</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t come back from that. Like a proper Ozymandias, his hubris, his pretension to predestined, prophecied greatness is followed by his inevitable decline. Killing Shireen has Stannis losing his real world fans and his in-story followers, his wife, his fight, his priestess, his army, his purpose and consequently his life. He proves very quickly that not all ends justify all means. He is the living embodiment of the Friedrich Nietzsche quotation that \u201cthose who fight monsters should take care that in the process they do not become monsters themselves.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>Stannis\u2019 final turn into villainy is actually paralleled by something another character does in ASOIAF. Except he is not a character we meet; he is a story-within-a-story; a legend, a prophecy or both. He is who Stannis thought he was: he is Azor Ahai. <br></p><p><br></p><p>And Azor Ahai absolutely does what Stannis did to turn into a villain, a monster: he murders\u2026 sacrifices an innocent to forge Lightbringer to end the Long Night. The way the story gets told makes that murder necessary, but Azor Ahai as the hero and winner of the Long Night gets to tell that story, gets to tell history his way. It\u2019s a legend and of course Azor Ahai is its hero. But remember the first person who claimed that \u201conly death can pay for life\u201d was a liar who wanted to make sure that \u201cThe Stallion Who Mounts the World\u201d died in the womb. (The second was Melisandre who tends to be wrong on a lot of things and whose track record on human sacrifice is abysmal.)</p><p>So there is absolutely a chance that Nissa Nissa\u2019s death was as necessary as Shireen\u2019s. We won\u2019t get the opportunity to fact-check the legend, the ancient history. But if it\u2019s a prophecy we might see its reality. </p><p>Of course, if GOT really goes the way of making a good guy go bad, then they can do this the middling way, the mediocre way. Theon\u2019s Sack of Winterfell Redux or Catelyn\u2019s descent into madness and murder. Or by making Dany a villain protagonist who is basically just another Cersei with dragons. And despite not quite measuring up to Stannis\u2019 dark turn \u2013 ambition, grief, fear, insecurity, jealousy, vanity, or disappointment leading to mass carnage delivered onto a hundred-thousand computer-generated extras is still more interesting than the Night King Sauron with his ice dragon. </p><p><br></p><p>But the reality is that we don\u2019t care about the 100,000 inhabitants of King\u2019s Landing. We will cry over a single Hot Pie before ever giving a fuck about a massive number of fictional people without any characteristics. Mass carnage is easy to oppose morally because it\u2019s something we oppose in real life but emotionally there is no difference between 10 fictional people or a billion fictional people \u2013 if they are simply there to be nameless, featureless cannon fodder. The ability to cause mass carnage doesn\u2019t make you the most emotionally effective villain by default. Quite the opposite. </p><p>If Bran were to warg a dragon and set King\u2019s Landing on fire, we would get that this whole Three-Eyed Raven thing didn\u2019t work out well for his ethics and be, like, \u201cokay\u201d. If Bran set fire to Arya, he would immediately become the most hated character ever on GOT. (And that isn\u2019t an exaggeration for effect). And any good intentions regarding defeating evil would matter as much as the fight against the Boltons did once Shireen started screaming. </p><p>I would like to add that Stannis died pretty much immediately after killing Shireen, blown over like a cardboard once Brienne showed up. But who would defeat or want to defeat a Stannis, an Azor Ahai who succeeded at ending the Long Night?</p><p>The ultimate story subversion when it comes to the classic \u201cgood vs. evil\u201d plot is that the bad guy wins.</p><p> And wouldn\u2019t that be something if it was surprise villain protagonist? We get someone winning that we would have been okay with winning until they turned into GOT\u2019s least liked character? Wouldn\u2019t that be bittersweet? Getting who you were okay with, perhaps even wanted on the Iron Throne, who might even know which is the right tax plan and what to do with baby orcs\u2026 \u00a0except they suck now?</p><p>Now who could that true Azor Ahai possibly be?</p><p>Is there someone who has been fighting monsters longer than anyone else has? Who has been so corrupted by that fight that he has tried and sacrificed already everything he could and had to defeat them? A man on quasi-religious crusade? A man who has the sort of righteous hubris and single-minded focus on the White Walkers that makes him often deaf to good advice? Who who has already laid down his life for a chance\u2026 and even a \u201cno-chance-at-all-now-let-me-drown-in-an-ice-lake\u201d at defeating the Night King? Is this possibly the same guy who we think is going to be crucial to the defeat of the White Walkers? \u00a0The one who has the perfect bloodline to claim the Iron Throne in the end? The one who is shown to Melisandre when she looks for her prophecied chosen one in the fire? The one who appears to be the straight hero of the story, the Luke Skywalker, the only major character where pulling a Stannis would actually shock us? \u00a0The one who has never been \u201cprofoundly wrong\u201d?</p><p>I am not saying, we are getting \u201cAegon, the Worst of His Name\u201d. I am saying that if I wanted to create a villain who subverts all expectations while fulfilling them, a villain who is truly compelling and whose turn emotionally wrecks the audience, I would not make it happen by having Daenerys or Bran roast King\u2019s Landing. I simply would choose a more likable and successful version of Stannis and have him doing something terrible, wrongfully believing it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Now theoretically this could be anyone but little Sam. And regardless of that character\u2019s identity, they would be a great, compelling villain. Practically though, the best candidate for going off that particular deep end is not some random second tier character. And it\u2019s not Daenerys \u201cWhat Even Are White Walkers?\u201d or Bran \u201cI\u2019m <strike>a robotic, omniscient plot device now</strike> the Three-Eyed Raven now\u201d Stark either. </p><p>It\u2019s Jon. </p><p>***</p><p>There is an issue with this though. Stannis murdering a family member/sacrificing a child for their royal blood to win a battle was simply a continuation of Stannis\u2019 previous actions. Stannis had no issue with his wife\u2019s uncle being burned as a sacrifice to R'hllor, had his brother murdered to win a battle, and attempted to have his underage nephew (Edric Storm in the books, Gendry in the show) sacrificed for his royal blood.</p><p>Killing Shireen is Stannis taking this to its logical extreme. Everything he does is simply something he has done before. Except this time the audience isn\u2019t given an out: Shireen doesn\u2019t escape like Edric/Gendry, we care for her (unlike Alester Florent) and she isn\u2019t Stannis\u2019 opponent in battle (Renly).</p><p>What Stannis is doing, is not surprising or entirely unprecedented. It is ultimately just a darker twist on something he has done before. Which is weird because you would think that something that crosses a moral event horizon would be a real departure from his previous actions. But it\u2019s not and that is really crucial if we want to discuss Stannis 2.0.</p><p>If a good character goes bad then having them simply do something they\u2019ve done before \u2013 \u00a0except this time it\u2019s just too much \u2013 makes sense. Just like the road to hell is paved with good intentions, escalating villainy should be a slippery slope of ever indefensible bad deeds.</p><p>And this is why it makes no sense to look at Jon and wonder who he is going to burn at the stake for R'hllor \u2013 because he won\u2019t. \u00a0What he would do to incur the audience\u2019s disdain needs to be something he has kind of done before. And that he has done on the show before, because it stands to reason that the show would want to keep its foreshadowing. (Hence Gendry\u2019s slightly pointless kidnapping by Melisandre in the show.)</p><p>So the the baby swap is out since it didn\u2019t happen on the show. Breaking a vow is a bit too generic and on its lonesome will not evoke any emotional reaction. And making high-handed, impulsive decisions that end up with terrible consequences has been already done with Jon making a series of high-handed, badly thought through decisions that netted the Night King a dragon and destroyed the Wall and yet netted Jon no audience disdain at all. So probably not that one either.</p><p>That leaves his relationship with Ygritte. In the books, we only see this relationship from Jon\u2019s point of view with all his justifications and inner struggles and his self-knowledge that while he lies about his allegiance to the Wildlings\u2019 cause, his feelings for Ygritte are real.</p><p>Now if one imagines that relationship from Ygritte\u2019s point of view (as she is in the books), Jon would come out of that as a supreme douchebag. He lead her on, lied to her, pretended to have feelings for her, then left her, publicly humiliated her and finally participated in a battle with her on the other side. Jon doesn\u2019t kill her but he is willing to do so by fighting her. </p><p>Now a real neutral point of view that doesn\u2019t vilify Ygritte to prop up Jon as a cool dude (as the show has done with her allying herself with cannibals and the village massacre), would be more of a wash, ethically speaking. Jon lies to Ygritte but his life is at stake and it wasn\u2019t even his own idea in the first place. There are consent issues with their relationship and Ygritte is as willing to kill Jon when she participates in that battle as it\u2019s the case the other way around.</p><p>But then Stannis wasn\u2019t that unjustified to go after Renly who was willing to fight and kill him in battle after all. Killing Renly nearly rates as self-defense. And Edric Storm got away. The question is not how horrible Jon\u2019s actions towards Ygritte were. But rather what the escalation of that sort of overall action would be like.</p><p>Now due to time constraints the only relationship where Jon could pull an escalated \u201cYgritte\u201d is his relationship with Daenerys. And here I am kind of puzzled by the discourse around the idea. Because as passionately as people argue about it, they actually agree quite fundamentally: that Jon is doing it/not doing because he is the quintessential good guy. </p><p>That he either betrays his lover or the plutocratic will of his nation is disregarded as some sort of higher purpose collateral that doesn\u2019t at all reflect on his moral character.</p><p>But isn\u2019t Occam\u2019s Razor to the question of how a \u201cgood guy\u201d manages to betray either lover or nation simply to question the \u201cgood guy\u201d part?</p><p>But let\u2019s step back a bit. The theory that Jon is playing Dany proposes that Jon initiates this emotional manipulation because she wonders aloud about two things (while he wants her commitment on the fight against the White Walkers): 1. Her ability to achieve her overall strategic goal of winning the Iron Throne 2. What happens to her rear if she pulls all of her forces north.</p><p>Now, Jon never actually answers any of these questions (or any questions on how to get the Northern Lords to remain loyal to him and Dany) and that is a bit problematic. Because the second question of what happens in a war if you leave one side open to your enemies is an enormously important one.</p><p>What Jon appears to do, is rely on a truism about the North: that it cannot be conquered in Winter (and Winter is here.)</p><p>*beleaguered sigh*</p><p>This truism exists in our world about two countries. One is considered unconquerable in Winter, the other unconquerable in general. And while these truisms have held true for few centuries now, the reality is that attempts to conquer them have devastated both countries on more than one occasion to the sound of millions of dead inhabitants and bombing it to the bottom of the HDI.</p><p>If Jon relies on Winter to protect him and his allies from Cersei, he is an idiot. If Cersei attacks the unprotected North from the South, his ability to fight the White Walkers will be profoundly diminished even if Cersei fails at conquering the North itself. Dany is right to ask this question and he is wrong to ignore it. </p><p>And if that theory pans out and Jon took these strategic, legitimate concerns as a sign that he needs to loverboy it up instead of thinking how to protect the North from the South, then that\u2019s next level mansplaining. <br></p><p>But forget that point for a bit and go back to the situation in which Jon supposedly initiates it. He is recovering after the Wight Hunt and Dany swears to avenge her dragon while musing on her overall strategy of winning Westeros. And while Jon isn\u2019t in good shape, he is not in mortal danger. Not in general, not specifically by Dany. She is letting her hair down and she\u2019s pledging her support to his cause. </p><p>Jon\u2019s life is not the least on the line and the question whether Dany would or would not have pulled out of the war against the White Walkers if Jon hadn\u2019t started flirting with her in that moment is an unanswerable hypothetical. No matter how you slice or dice it, it\u2019s not certain at all (not to the audience, not to Jon) that she would have pulled out. </p><p>So Jon had three choices in this moment: not initiate a romantic relationship with Dany, initiate a romantic relationship out of genuine feeling, initiate a romantic relationship to manipulate her. </p><p>None of these choices would spell certain doom. It\u2019s not at all like the relationship with Ygritte, where not going along with it would have blown his cover and cost his life. It\u2019s also distinct from that situation insofar as he didn\u2019t choose to go undercover with the Wildlings in the first place but was commanded into the situation by his superior officer.</p><p>If Jon initiated the relationship to manipulate Dany, he chose to do this voluntarily without true necessity. It\u2019s, in fact, as necessary as Littlefinger manipulating Lysa into intrigue, murder and ill-fated marriage was. Of course, without that manipulation Littlefinger would have never advanced at court and become Master of the Coin, Lord of Harrenhall and Sweetrobin\u2019s guardian. But none of these things were necessary to grant his survival at any time.</p><p>The key difference between Jon and Littlefinger is that Jon allies himself with Dany to ensure mankind\u2019s survival instead of personal gain. But on the balance, another difference between Littlefinger and Jon\u2019s situation is that the romantic relationship wasn\u2019t necessary to ensure Dany\u2019s support. In fact, even the idea that Dany\u2019s concerns are sign of her wavering in her commitment is a minority if not fringe opinion among GOT\u2019s audience.</p><p>And that makes the idea of Jon manipulating Dany very unpalatable. The lack of necessity makes him a Littlefinger, rather than a Robb or a Ned or even the Jon who lied to Ygritte. And audiences prefer to see their heroes as honorable fools rather than manipulative, emotionally abusive jerks.</p><p>Because there is the heart of the problem. If Jon is truly manipulating Dany, he is an emotionally abusive jerk. He is profoundly wrong. He is the guy that your BFF has warned you about. \u201cHe is just using you for [something.]\u201d</p><p>And that hits home in a way shadowbabies and Frey Pies and Qyburn doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t know any necromancers who vivisect people. But we know the kind of jerk that Jon would be. It\u2019s not theoretical, it\u2019s something we know and because of that will not appreciate.</p><p>***</p><p>But while this absolutely checks off\u00a0\u201cmake the evil deed painful to the audience\u201d point in the \u201ccompelling villain\u201d check list, it\u2019s still nowhere near as ethically questionable as Stannis burning Shireen. <br></p><p>But Jon\u2019s Ygritte storyline doesn\u2019t end with him duping, betraying and leaving her. It ends with her getting killed. And not just killed, but killed in battle against Jon and his brothers. While Jon is not directly responsible for her death \u2013 he neither instigated nor executed the killing \u2013 he was willing to risk that his actions would kill her in that battle. The goal of a battle is to win and to use the Patton quote from above \u201cmake the other bastard die for his country.\u201d Of course, Jon acted in self-defense, Ygritte was fighting that battle against him and the NW voluntarily, fully willing, ready and able to kill him.</p><p>But then, to go back to Stannis, Stannis was also just acting in self-defense when he send the shadowbaby assassin to kill Renly. Renly had the superior force and showed himself fully willing, ready and able to kill Stannis in battle. The question whether Stannis\u2019 assassination of Renly is justified is a digression too far because that is not the point. The point is that Jon and Stannis got some person killed who was really close to them (brother, lover) and that was kind of, maybe, perhaps justified self-defense. You can argue for it in both cases. </p><p>However, as I mentioned before, Stannis\u2019 ultimate escalation of Renly\u2019s murder is killing Shireen. There is no maybe, perhaps, kind of, about the lack of justification for it. Stannis did not act in self-defense, Stannis was not provoked. The true necessity was also absent\u2026 although the proof for that is just hindsight. The sacrifice was supposed to save Stannis and his army. It did not. Thus it was never necessary. The whole thing is just wholly indefensible.</p><p>Now would an escalation of Jon\u2019s Ygritte storyline limit itself to the affair and betrayal or would it go all the way down to that self-defensive arrow that Jon wasn\u2019t directly responsible for? Except for a Stannis-like escalation that arrow could not be self-defensive, it would have to be undeserved, unjustified, unnecessary <i>and</i> Jon\u2019s responsibility. </p><p>The audience doesn\u2019t even have to like Dany at that point. That would be just crossing all moral event horizons, turning Jon into a villain and serving a \u201c<strike>King Arthur</strike> <strike>Aragorn</strike> Jon \u00a0Snow is the final villain\u201d plot twist that makes R+L=J look like child\u2019s play in comparison. It would be truly an epic twist, ending up in the plot twist pantheon next to \u201cBruce is a ghost\u201d and \u201cSoylent Green\u201d.</p><p>However, I don\u2019t think this is gonna happen. A villain protagonist on that level would have been foreshadowed much, much more, both in the books and the show. \u201cThe villain wins\u201d is also really nihilistic and ends up on a quite bitter note with very little sweetness. Davos, Brienne and Sam emerging alone from the rubble would be a more positive and happier ending. It\u2019s also the sort of plot twist you think of five books and seven TV seasons later (too late), not when you conceive the story. <br></p><p><br></p><p>So what will happen to Jon instead if he doesn\u2019t become a villain?</p><p>There are really only two options: his characterization remains in a class of its own and he remains the only truly good guy protagonist or he takes a level in realpolitik and starts to play as dirty as necessary in whatever way. Not quite Jon, the villain but Jon the ethically challenged, Jon the Utilitarian. <br></p><p>(By the way, I am not saying that he has to play dirty with specific characters to qualify, just that that he has to play dirty somehow. In fact, playing dirty with certain characters might evoke a negative, emotional audience reaction that is not in proportion to the ethics violation it presents and thus the whole Utilitarianism bit might accidentally devolve into perceived villainy.)</p><p>The really fascinating bit about this is that Jon\u2019s characterization will define ASOIAF quite significantly. Jon is so crucial to the story\u2019s most fundamental conflict, that even if you discard the idea that he is <a href=\"http://blindestspot.tumblr.com/post/166182300140/aegon-his-is-the-song-of-ice-and-fire\">The Protagonist</a>, you would still have to agree that he is one of the most important protagonists. His characterization will contribute and lead to the resolution of that conflict. If he resolves it by playing dirty, the moral of the story will quite different than it is if he resolves it by always taking the heroic, high road. </p><p>And it\u2019s not just the moral of the story. Once the story decides to land on \u201cJon, the moral\u201d or \u201cJon, the Utilitarian\u201d, the question whether we are consuming \u201cLord of the Rings with boobs\u201d or a true deconstruction of Lord of the Rings will answer itself. And that will reflect on more than just Jon\u2019s storyline. If Jon stays heroic, Night King Sauron, our final, two-dimensional villain and other neat and flat resolutions become much more likely.</p><p>As such I would argue that the Jon\u2019s characterization will define how good ASOIAF\u2019s famed realism truly is, what ideals it propagates, and what kind of story ASOIAF is. </p><p>I honestly can\u2019t predict how this will play out. But I remember that Ned and the Red Wedding promised a deconstruction of the genre, an acknowledgement that taking the high road constantly can be a dead end in real life. Jon not needing to be smarter than them in the end would break that promise. <br></p>",
                "content": "<p>Over the past year I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of asks about Jon and what I think is going on with him. During that time I&rsquo;ve also managed to calm down about the inconsistent number of redshirts during the Wight Hunt. Yes, I remember that this was a thing that happened, along with a bunch of other dei ex machina, like Cersei&rsquo;s brilliant strategies for everything, Jon&rsquo;s repeated, increasingly dumb survivals and the whole Winterfell plot. </p><p>But calming down about them meant that I could think about Game of Thrones again in a manner that kind of naively assumes that the work is coherent . That 2+2=4, not 5, or orange, or a tiger. And this is what I think is going on with Jon and why it is so crucial to the whole work.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>George R.R. Martin once said that <i>A Song of Ice and Fire </i>is supposed to \nhave a bittersweet ending. Now that phrase covers a lot of ground. A \nbittersweet ending might be just ASOIAF&rsquo;s Scouring of the Shire (which \nat this stage is assured) and a few good guys passing into the Great \nBeyond (also nearly certain) &ndash; which would be a copy of Lord of the \nRings. </p><p>A bittersweet ending might also be Davos, Brienne and Sam \nemerging alone from the rubble like the unhappy winners of a Battle \nRoyale. A few good guys surviving would technically make the ending not a\n complete downer and thus &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo;.</p><p>However, a more nuanced \nlook at a bittersweet ending should look beyond mere survival and \ndestruction but at an ending that irrevocably changes the characters and\n how and what we think of them. </p><p>An issue that strikes readers as unrealistic about Lord of the Rings is&nbsp; that a lot of its human and hobbit-y heroes move on from the events of the story into psychologically very ordinary, uncomplicated lives that they would have lead even without the events of the story. Sam, Merry, Pippin&rsquo;s (and to a lesser degree Faramir, Aragorn and Eowyn&rsquo;s) easy passing into normalcy feels vaguely hollow.</p><p>If GRRM really plans to have a realistic take on Lord of the Rings and its &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo; ending (and with his complaints about Aragorn&rsquo;s tax policy it appears that this is a crucial element of ASOIAF), then obviously he is going to continue what he has been doing all along and create an interplay between narrative events and characterization. Take Arya, for example. In the early parts of AGoT she would have not wanted to become a Faceless Man &ndash; for obvious reasons. But Arya from a few books later, after events have matured and traumatized her, wants to become one. And that choice will again impact her characterization and that will in turn impact future events. &#8232;It is logical that this interplay will continue right up until the end. So speculation has to take into account that these characters are dynamic and can be pushed by events into new directions. And not just &ldquo;can&rdquo; &ndash; but will be. </p><p>The question is not who will be alive to experience the Scoured Shire but who they will be at this point. And that change shouldn&rsquo;t just be cosmetic or physical, it needs to be psychological, visible, noticeable and profound. We shouldn&rsquo;t get an Aragorn who just walks into a kingship after a two battles, marries the cute elf girl and then doesn&rsquo;t have a tax plan. <br /></p><p>And obviously, I am not talking about Gilly. I am very much talking about ASOIAF&rsquo;s Aragorn. I am talking about Jon.</p><p>&hellip;<br /></p><p>Now here is a hypothetical scenario for Season 8: Jon with the help of Dany and her dragons (and, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, the usual stock characters who fight every fictional war for us, even those in space), fight the White Walkers, win, then fight Cersei, then win (the order of this is might be reversed) and then Jon&rsquo;s revealed to be true heir and has to rebuild Westeros.</p><p>How does any of this really change and mature Jon as a character? How does being right about everything (the White Walkers being the real threat), then leading a righteous force to victory over evil make him a realistic take on Aragorn?</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t.&#8232;</p><p><br />What Jon needs after five books and seven season of making serviceable to great, sensible, ethical, right strategic choices (with admittedly a number of great tactical errors in between) is being wrong. And not just being wrong about failing to communicate to his sworn brothers what his strategy is, not just wrong about going on that Wight Hunt, not just wrong to send Sam away, not just lightly ethically challenged for exchanging a pair of babies against one mother&rsquo;s will or misleading his love interest on his commitment to her political cause&hellip; but wrong in a truly profound way that the audience cannot blame on stupidity or short-sightedness. </p><p>I admit that calling it &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; or even &ldquo;profoundly wrong&rdquo; is a bit of misnomer. What I am trying to get at is the character going into a direction where the audience cannot and should not easily follow. Those actions would be too alien as might be their rationalizations. These actions should strike the audience as questionable, reprehensible, immoral, unethical, or dishonorable.</p><p>A perhaps too perfect example of such an action is Cersei firing up the Sept. It&rsquo;s mass murder and it&rsquo;s intended by her to be mass murder. If anyone in the audience found it not reprehensible and immoral, I would have some questions for these people.</p><p>But Cersei firing up the Sept was a success. Her survival was at stake - and she survived. Before her kingdom was full of powerful enemies and afterwards it wasn&rsquo;t. And she even snatched the Iron Throne afterwards despite having no royal Targaryen or Baratheon ancestry.</p><p>In realpolitik terms, Cersei made the &ldquo;right&rdquo; choice. All other choices would have lead to her death. The first rule of anything is that you cannot do anything if you&rsquo;re dead.</p><p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s a lesson Jon desperately needs to learn. His twice-tried strategy of rushing alone against an army of his enemies is idiotic. It might be honorable for a war leader to be the first person on the battlefield but it&rsquo;s not a winning war strategy.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a nice thing to say, but it&rsquo;s necessary for a war time general or commander to be willing to have other people die for him and his goal. And not just for him but in front of him, literally shielding him. An army commander who isn&rsquo;t willing to ensure his own survival, is gambling with such terrible odds that he has already lost the war. </p><p>Cersei&rsquo;s strategy of killing her enemies instead of allowing herself to be killed is profoundly wrong, immoral and yet Jon needs understand that when mankind&rsquo;s survival are at stake an immoral action like that might be a necessary choice.</p><p>His attempt to drown in an ice lake alone is a sign that at this point he hasn&rsquo;t understood the necessity of being alive to lead a war at all. As George S. Patton put it: &ldquo;no poor bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb son-of-a-bitching bastard die for his country.&rdquo;</p><p>Out of all our main protagonists, Jon has never been willing to play as dirty as it should be necessary for an apocalyptic fight such as his. Unlike Sansa&rsquo;s willingness to go along with Littlefinger&rsquo;s nefarious plans for her cousin in the Vale, Arya&rsquo;s willingness to kill potentially innocent people for the Faceless Men, Tyrion raping a prostitute and killing Shae, the torture of innocents during Dany&rsquo;s Slavers&rsquo;s Bay arc, Bran warging Hodor&hellip; Jon has nothing in his arc that is as dark, dishonorable or questionable as these things. Jon appears to be a character class apart, like the hero of a more classic fantasy epic.</p><p>Is this because Jon&rsquo;s so special that his arc is a whole different genre or is this because he hasn&rsquo;t leveled up in realpolitik yet?</p><p>Or is there perhaps even a third option to deal with his relative over-the-top good guy characterization?</p><p>***</p><p>You know, when it comes to stories about morality like Game of Thrones a crucial factor for their success is not just the quality of the good guys but also the quality of the villains.</p><p>And what makes a compelling villain?</p><p>IMO, they hit more than one of these characteristics:</p><p>1. They are well-rounded, fully realized characters, drawn with the same care as the heroes.</p><p>2. They are able to win against the good guys. They are not a cardboard that will be blown over once the heroes wave a magic stick or sword around.</p><p>3. Their evil deeds get an emotional reaction out of the audience. (Most audiences tend to have a vague discomfort with CGI mass carnage while reacting to a well-executed scene of high school bullying with actual empathy or even horror.)</p><p>4. Their motivations are understandable, perhaps even sympathetic. At best they are a well-intentioned extremist, utilitarianism gone wrong, rather than setting stuff on fire because their mom was mean to them once.</p><p>Now looking at this list, it becomes obvious that GOT has a problem with its current crop of villains. Any of the three that are left (Cersei, the Night King, Euron) could be the Final Boss &ndash; to use a video game term. But none of them are very compelling villains. Two of them are inhuman monsters. To call their characterization shallow would be an insult to puddles. </p><p>And Cersei, the only one with a decent characterization (and some past Mean Girls bullying sins of her own) suffers from being incredibly stupid in the books, having a prophecy running against her and stealing Aegon from Essos&rsquo; story in the show. In other words, Cersei&rsquo;s chances of success and survival and actually making it this far in the books are as good as that of a snowflake on a hot summer&rsquo;s day. One suspects that she is a show-only final-ish villain, so if one looks for GRRM&rsquo;s final-ish villains, they would not find Cersei.<br /></p><p>Talking about chances of success &ndash; the Night King isn&rsquo;t winning this either. Because then ASOIAF would reveal itself to be a nihilistic mess in which all the human storylines were nothing but shaggydog stories. So the Night King is &nbsp;bound to melt in the summer sun along with Cersei. There is little question about it. And is Euron &ldquo;was he even mentioned in the first book?&rdquo; Greyjoy &nbsp;really going to win the Iron Throne in the end? Is anyone taking this possibility seriously?</p><p>And what are their motivations? Ambition, being evil and being anti-human. None of them are particularly sympathetic.</p><p>In one word, GOT&rsquo;s current crop of villains is not particularly exciting &ndash; especially if you compare them with some of the villains that came before them. And if one of these three is the Final Boss, he or she is gonna be lame.</p><p>But a lame Final Boss is actually a great tradition in the genre. In Lord of the Rings Sauron appears to be literally two-dimensional and about as interesting as a character. (Gollum gets to be the well-written villain and he is doing very little damage to the world at large.) Voldemort in Harry Potter is completely outshone as the most despised, scary villain of the series by the one-book-wonder Dolores Umbridge who excels at committing low-key evil deeds that make every reader/viewer wince in sympathy. The Emperor in the original Star Wars trilogy is&hellip; there and then dead and has fewer fans than a one-line bounty hunter. And the same fans that endlessly shout &ldquo;Han shot first&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t even appear to care that he got a complete face replacement in the Special Editions. And if there is one consistent complaint about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it&rsquo;s that its villains tend to be boring and forgettable. Yet they&rsquo;re lame and forgettable to the tune of billions of box office dollars.</p><p>So a lame Final Boss for the heroes to fight&hellip; that is indeed a thing. And that might be just the thing GOT/ASOIAF is doing. This is what we have to seriously consider. We are likely to get a MCU villain&hellip; you know on the level of Ronan the Destroyer or Malekith, the Dark Elf. And you probably need to google in which movies those two turned up.</p><p>That would be a terrible let down.</p><p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s not actually that terrible of a thing? Because if our final boss and villain is not Cersei, the Night King, or Euron, it&rsquo;s a good guy gone bad. Someone who is currently fighting on the side of the living before becoming someone who needs to be fought.</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible that this is in the cards. After &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;, the penultimate episode of <i>Breaking Bad</i>, aired, GRRM wrote on his blog that &ldquo;Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros, I need to do something about that.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The thing is that White appeared to start out as a sympathetic if flawed hero you were rooting for even as he was making meth. What made White monstrous is not doing depraved psycho shit beyond comprehension (like nailing a living, pregnant woman to a ship like Euron Greyjoy) but that he appears to evolve into this monster before the audience&rsquo;s eyes. </p><p><i>Breaking Bad</i> tricks the audience into liking a character for much longer than he ever deserved and that becomes crystal clear in that penultimate episode. If GRRM wants a monster like White he can&rsquo;t use his old, repetitive trick of making a one-dimensional psychopath do depraved stuff. He has to logically progress a character we root for into a monster.</p><p>(Of course, GRRM might also not be able to pull it off, however much he wants to. It could be that he has not prepared the ground to make a main character go Walter White and thus it will always fall short of Breaking Bad&rsquo;s accomplishment. Sure, Greyworm or Dolorous Edd could become evil and monstrous but even GRRM should know that&rsquo;s not quite the same as making your main protagonist evil.</p><p>I might also be wrong on GRRM understanding what makes Walter White feel so monstrous. The first big sign that White took the road down to hell is not an act of murder or sadism but simply not helping someone who is choking to death. His monstrosity is based in a three-dimensional characterization, not in particularly outrageous acts of evil. He is monstrous because he used to be likable. If GRRM doesn&rsquo;t see that, he might actually think that one-dimensional psychopath Euron nailing his pregnant girlfriend to a ship is nailing the same kind of monstrosity.</p><p>He also could be talking about a plot point we now know about but that he has not published yet &ndash; like Stannis burning Shireen. So one should be careful looking for ASOIAF&rsquo;s Walter White.)</p><p>Interestingly enough, the trick <i>Breaking Bad</i> is pulling is quite old. White isn&rsquo;t making meth by chance, it was the worst thing his creator could think of besides him becoming an arms dealer. The twist of Breaking Bad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo; is actually not that White becomes bad but that he has always been bad. You&rsquo;ll find a similar character in Humbert Humbert in Nabokov&rsquo;s <i>Lolita</i> where his monstrosity is barely a plot twist and even Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> where it&rsquo;s none at all. (The trope of the protagonist being a piece of shit throughout the whole story usually goes down as &ldquo;villain protagonist&rdquo; and the list of stories containing one is pretty expansive.) But the plot twist of a surprise villain protagonist is such an old one that Aesop already codified it in his fable &ldquo;The Farmer and the Viper&rdquo; around 600 B.C. (Farmer helps harmless looking viper, then viper bites him because it&rsquo;s a viper. And has been a viper all along. Duh.)</p><p>Now if Dany, for example, turned into a villain then she would fall squarely into villain protagonist territory. But the fun thing is that doesn&rsquo;t mean that she is already one. The viper is not a villain until Aesop has it biting the farmer. If Dany decides to slaughter her future subjects by the thousands just so she can have the Iron Throne (and this is portrayed as despicable) then this will be in line with the Dany from the first season/AGoT who wanted the Dothraki to wage their type of warfare (pillaging, raping, enslaving, killing) onto thousands of her future subjects, so she could have the Iron Throne. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Dany will cross this particular moral event horizon.</p><p>Whether Dany will turn out to be a villain protagonist is not a question of foreshadowing. It&rsquo;s a question whether the authorial intent will will it into existence. The viper is a poisonous snake but if the author hasn&rsquo;t it biting the farmer, that poison doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p><p>Now Dany is a well-rounded character (same as Cersei) and might be difficult to defeat but her most likely, hypothetical, evil deed (mass carnage via dragon) is not particularly compelling and neither is ambition as her motivation. Villainous Dany is about as compelling as Cersei. Keeping Cersei for so long when there is Villainous Dany in the wings strikes me as a weak narrative choice:&nbsp;&ldquo;Meet your new villain, same as the old villain&hellip;&rdquo; The difference would be the element of surprise but that&rsquo;s a paltry surprise, especially since Villainous Dany was supposed to be The Big Plot Twist. <br /></p><p>Honestly, Dany as the mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain is a low-hanging fruit. Call me edgy, but it&rsquo;s just nowhere near &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s Boromir getting seduced by the Ring.</p><p>And there are not a lot of precedents for that storyline in ASOIAF. You know the story of a good guy gone beyond redemption evil. There is Theon, whose ambition, jealousy and insecurity drove him into sacking Winterfell and killing two children &ndash; but even he turned out to be not to be beyond redemption. There is Catelyn, but she goes crazy and becomes a zombie, so it&rsquo;s hard to compare.</p><p>But there is, of course, the most compelling, interesting and meaningful character arc of a good guy gone bad: Stannis Baratheon. But he isn&rsquo;t a good precedent for a mass-carnage causing, ambitious type of villain.<br /></p><p>***</p><p>You see, Stannis starts out as not exactly the most sympathetic character: he burns people and places of worship, he is a religious nut, he has his brother killed. But after getting defeating at the Battle of Blackwater, his arc does a 180. He gets the call from the North to save the realm, and out of all of the five Kings involved in the war of the same name, he is the only one he realizes that in order to &ldquo;win the realm, you have to save the realm.&rdquo;</p><p>That isn&rsquo;t a coincidence. Stannis is also the only king who fights for a higher purpose. Joffrey, Balon, Robb, and Renly just fight for power (be it the power over all of Westeros or the power that lies in independence). Stannis is fighting not just for power but also for his religion, for his one true god; he is fighting a crusade. That out of all the kings, the king who believes that his religion will save Westeros ends up wanting to save it from a supernatural threat is not a coincidence. One thing clearly causes the other.</p><p>And once he makes this choice, Stannis, the Mannis (as he was lovingly called by his fans once upon a time) always fights the bad guys, he fights for the living. Of course, he doesn&rsquo;t stop being a religious nut, he doesn&rsquo;t stop burning people, he is inflexible in his beliefs, he still thinks he is the chosen one, he is Azor Ahai, he is the One True King, he belongs on the Iron Throne. But he is also the man who executes soldiers of his army who rape. He has good sides. But what weighs so heavily in his favor is that out of all the people in power in Westeros, he is fighting the bad guys.</p><p>And that matters &ndash; until it doesn&rsquo;t when Stannis strikes out to fight the Boltons. The Boltons are special because they are despicable without exceptions. Even the Freys have Robb&rsquo;s squire in their midst to have that one decent family member/bannerman that all of Westeros&rsquo; notable houses appear to have. All but the Boltons anyway. There is not a good or decent living Bolton. They are the literal worst Westeros has to offer.</p><p>And yet, Stannis manages to cross a moral event horizon that makes everyone forget that he is doing it to fight the Worst. And that moral event horizon is not the sacking of a city, the killing of hundred of thousands. He is not extinguishing a house or a people. He manages it, doing something every single GOT character could do right now (save for little Sam.) He kills a single person.</p><p>And he doesn&rsquo;t come back from that. Like a proper Ozymandias, his hubris, his pretension to predestined, prophecied greatness is followed by his inevitable decline. Killing Shireen has Stannis losing his real world fans and his in-story followers, his wife, his fight, his priestess, his army, his purpose and consequently his life. He proves very quickly that not all ends justify all means. He is the living embodiment of the Friedrich Nietzsche quotation that &ldquo;those who fight monsters should take care that in the process they do not become monsters themselves.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Stannis&rsquo; final turn into villainy is actually paralleled by something another character does in ASOIAF. Except he is not a character we meet; he is a story-within-a-story; a legend, a prophecy or both. He is who Stannis thought he was: he is Azor Ahai. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>And Azor Ahai absolutely does what Stannis did to turn into a villain, a monster: he murders&hellip; sacrifices an innocent to forge Lightbringer to end the Long Night. The way the story gets told makes that murder necessary, but Azor Ahai as the hero and winner of the Long Night gets to tell that story, gets to tell history his way. It&rsquo;s a legend and of course Azor Ahai is its hero. But remember the first person who claimed that &ldquo;only death can pay for life&rdquo; was a liar who wanted to make sure that &ldquo;The Stallion Who Mounts the World&rdquo; died in the womb. (The second was Melisandre who tends to be wrong on a lot of things and whose track record on human sacrifice is abysmal.)</p><p>So there is absolutely a chance that Nissa Nissa&rsquo;s death was as necessary as Shireen&rsquo;s. We won&rsquo;t get the opportunity to fact-check the legend, the ancient history. But if it&rsquo;s a prophecy we might see its reality. </p><p>Of course, if GOT really goes the way of making a good guy go bad, then they can do this the middling way, the mediocre way. Theon&rsquo;s Sack of Winterfell Redux or Catelyn&rsquo;s descent into madness and murder. Or by making Dany a villain protagonist who is basically just another Cersei with dragons. And despite not quite measuring up to Stannis&rsquo; dark turn &ndash; ambition, grief, fear, insecurity, jealousy, vanity, or disappointment leading to mass carnage delivered onto a hundred-thousand computer-generated extras is still more interesting than the Night King Sauron with his ice dragon. </p><p><br /></p><p>But the reality is that we don&rsquo;t care about the 100,000 inhabitants of King&rsquo;s Landing. We will cry over a single Hot Pie before ever giving a fuck about a massive number of fictional people without any characteristics. Mass carnage is easy to oppose morally because it&rsquo;s something we oppose in real life but emotionally there is no difference between 10 fictional people or a billion fictional people &ndash; if they are simply there to be nameless, featureless cannon fodder. The ability to cause mass carnage doesn&rsquo;t make you the most emotionally effective villain by default. Quite the opposite. </p><p>If Bran were to warg a dragon and set King&rsquo;s Landing on fire, we would get that this whole Three-Eyed Raven thing didn&rsquo;t work out well for his ethics and be, like, &ldquo;okay&rdquo;. If Bran set fire to Arya, he would immediately become the most hated character ever on GOT. (And that isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration for effect). And any good intentions regarding defeating evil would matter as much as the fight against the Boltons did once Shireen started screaming. </p><p>I would like to add that Stannis died pretty much immediately after killing Shireen, blown over like a cardboard once Brienne showed up. But who would defeat or want to defeat a Stannis, an Azor Ahai who succeeded at ending the Long Night?</p><p>The ultimate story subversion when it comes to the classic &ldquo;good vs. evil&rdquo; plot is that the bad guy wins.</p><p> And wouldn&rsquo;t that be something if it was surprise villain protagonist? We get someone winning that we would have been okay with winning until they turned into GOT&rsquo;s least liked character? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be bittersweet? Getting who you were okay with, perhaps even wanted on the Iron Throne, who might even know which is the right tax plan and what to do with baby orcs&hellip; &nbsp;except they suck now?</p><p>Now who could that true Azor Ahai possibly be?</p><p>Is there someone who has been fighting monsters longer than anyone else has? Who has been so corrupted by that fight that he has tried and sacrificed already everything he could and had to defeat them? A man on quasi-religious crusade? A man who has the sort of righteous hubris and single-minded focus on the White Walkers that makes him often deaf to good advice? Who who has already laid down his life for a chance&hellip; and even a &ldquo;no-chance-at-all-now-let-me-drown-in-an-ice-lake&rdquo; at defeating the Night King? Is this possibly the same guy who we think is going to be crucial to the defeat of the White Walkers? &nbsp;The one who has the perfect bloodline to claim the Iron Throne in the end? The one who is shown to Melisandre when she looks for her prophecied chosen one in the fire? The one who appears to be the straight hero of the story, the Luke Skywalker, the only major character where pulling a Stannis would actually shock us? &nbsp;The one who has never been &ldquo;profoundly wrong&rdquo;?</p><p>I am not saying, we are getting &ldquo;Aegon, the Worst of His Name&rdquo;. I am saying that if I wanted to create a villain who subverts all expectations while fulfilling them, a villain who is truly compelling and whose turn emotionally wrecks the audience, I would not make it happen by having Daenerys or Bran roast King&rsquo;s Landing. I simply would choose a more likable and successful version of Stannis and have him doing something terrible, wrongfully believing it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p><p>Now theoretically this could be anyone but little Sam. And regardless of that character&rsquo;s identity, they would be a great, compelling villain. Practically though, the best candidate for going off that particular deep end is not some random second tier character. And it&rsquo;s not Daenerys &ldquo;What Even Are White Walkers?&rdquo; or Bran &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <strike>a robotic, omniscient plot device now</strike> the Three-Eyed Raven now&rdquo; Stark either. </p><p>It&rsquo;s Jon. </p><p>***</p><p>There is an issue with this though. Stannis murdering a family member/sacrificing a child for their royal blood to win a battle was simply a continuation of Stannis&rsquo; previous actions. Stannis had no issue with his wife&rsquo;s uncle being burned as a sacrifice to R'hllor, had his brother murdered to win a battle, and attempted to have his underage nephew (Edric Storm in the books, Gendry in the show) sacrificed for his royal blood.</p><p>Killing Shireen is Stannis taking this to its logical extreme. Everything he does is simply something he has done before. Except this time the audience isn&rsquo;t given an out: Shireen doesn&rsquo;t escape like Edric/Gendry, we care for her (unlike Alester Florent) and she isn&rsquo;t Stannis&rsquo; opponent in battle (Renly).</p><p>What Stannis is doing, is not surprising or entirely unprecedented. It is ultimately just a darker twist on something he has done before. Which is weird because you would think that something that crosses a moral event horizon would be a real departure from his previous actions. But it&rsquo;s not and that is really crucial if we want to discuss Stannis 2.0.</p><p>If a good character goes bad then having them simply do something they&rsquo;ve done before &ndash; &nbsp;except this time it&rsquo;s just too much &ndash; makes sense. Just like the road to hell is paved with good intentions, escalating villainy should be a slippery slope of ever indefensible bad deeds.</p><p>And this is why it makes no sense to look at Jon and wonder who he is going to burn at the stake for R'hllor &ndash; because he won&rsquo;t. &nbsp;What he would do to incur the audience&rsquo;s disdain needs to be something he has kind of done before. And that he has done on the show before, because it stands to reason that the show would want to keep its foreshadowing. (Hence Gendry&rsquo;s slightly pointless kidnapping by Melisandre in the show.)</p><p>So the the baby swap is out since it didn&rsquo;t happen on the show. Breaking a vow is a bit too generic and on its lonesome will not evoke any emotional reaction. And making high-handed, impulsive decisions that end up with terrible consequences has been already done with Jon making a series of high-handed, badly thought through decisions that netted the Night King a dragon and destroyed the Wall and yet netted Jon no audience disdain at all. So probably not that one either.</p><p>That leaves his relationship with Ygritte. In the books, we only see this relationship from Jon&rsquo;s point of view with all his justifications and inner struggles and his self-knowledge that while he lies about his allegiance to the Wildlings&rsquo; cause, his feelings for Ygritte are real.</p><p>Now if one imagines that relationship from Ygritte&rsquo;s point of view (as she is in the books), Jon would come out of that as a supreme douchebag. He lead her on, lied to her, pretended to have feelings for her, then left her, publicly humiliated her and finally participated in a battle with her on the other side. Jon doesn&rsquo;t kill her but he is willing to do so by fighting her. </p><p>Now a real neutral point of view that doesn&rsquo;t vilify Ygritte to prop up Jon as a cool dude (as the show has done with her allying herself with cannibals and the village massacre), would be more of a wash, ethically speaking. Jon lies to Ygritte but his life is at stake and it wasn&rsquo;t even his own idea in the first place. There are consent issues with their relationship and Ygritte is as willing to kill Jon when she participates in that battle as it&rsquo;s the case the other way around.</p><p>But then Stannis wasn&rsquo;t that unjustified to go after Renly who was willing to fight and kill him in battle after all. Killing Renly nearly rates as self-defense. And Edric Storm got away. The question is not how horrible Jon&rsquo;s actions towards Ygritte were. But rather what the escalation of that sort of overall action would be like.</p><p>Now due to time constraints the only relationship where Jon could pull an escalated &ldquo;Ygritte&rdquo; is his relationship with Daenerys. And here I am kind of puzzled by the discourse around the idea. Because as passionately as people argue about it, they actually agree quite fundamentally: that Jon is doing it/not doing because he is the quintessential good guy. </p><p>That he either betrays his lover or the plutocratic will of his nation is disregarded as some sort of higher purpose collateral that doesn&rsquo;t at all reflect on his moral character.</p><p>But isn&rsquo;t Occam&rsquo;s Razor to the question of how a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; manages to betray either lover or nation simply to question the &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; part?</p><p>But let&rsquo;s step back a bit. The theory that Jon is playing Dany proposes that Jon initiates this emotional manipulation because she wonders aloud about two things (while he wants her commitment on the fight against the White Walkers): 1. Her ability to achieve her overall strategic goal of winning the Iron Throne 2. What happens to her rear if she pulls all of her forces north.</p><p>Now, Jon never actually answers any of these questions (or any questions on how to get the Northern Lords to remain loyal to him and Dany) and that is a bit problematic. Because the second question of what happens in a war if you leave one side open to your enemies is an enormously important one.</p><p>What Jon appears to do, is rely on a truism about the North: that it cannot be conquered in Winter (and Winter is here.)</p><p>*beleaguered sigh*</p><p>This truism exists in our world about two countries. One is considered unconquerable in Winter, the other unconquerable in general. And while these truisms have held true for few centuries now, the reality is that attempts to conquer them have devastated both countries on more than one occasion to the sound of millions of dead inhabitants and bombing it to the bottom of the HDI.</p><p>If Jon relies on Winter to protect him and his allies from Cersei, he is an idiot. If Cersei attacks the unprotected North from the South, his ability to fight the White Walkers will be profoundly diminished even if Cersei fails at conquering the North itself. Dany is right to ask this question and he is wrong to ignore it. </p><p>And if that theory pans out and Jon took these strategic, legitimate concerns as a sign that he needs to loverboy it up instead of thinking how to protect the North from the South, then that&rsquo;s next level mansplaining. <br /></p><p>But forget that point for a bit and go back to the situation in which Jon supposedly initiates it. He is recovering after the Wight Hunt and Dany swears to avenge her dragon while musing on her overall strategy of winning Westeros. And while Jon isn&rsquo;t in good shape, he is not in mortal danger. Not in general, not specifically by Dany. She is letting her hair down and she&rsquo;s pledging her support to his cause. </p><p>Jon&rsquo;s life is not the least on the line and the question whether Dany would or would not have pulled out of the war against the White Walkers if Jon hadn&rsquo;t started flirting with her in that moment is an unanswerable hypothetical. No matter how you slice or dice it, it&rsquo;s not certain at all (not to the audience, not to Jon) that she would have pulled out. </p><p>So Jon had three choices in this moment: not initiate a romantic relationship with Dany, initiate a romantic relationship out of genuine feeling, initiate a romantic relationship to manipulate her. </p><p>None of these choices would spell certain doom. It&rsquo;s not at all like the relationship with Ygritte, where not going along with it would have blown his cover and cost his life. It&rsquo;s also distinct from that situation insofar as he didn&rsquo;t choose to go undercover with the Wildlings in the first place but was commanded into the situation by his superior officer.</p><p>If Jon initiated the relationship to manipulate Dany, he chose to do this voluntarily without true necessity. It&rsquo;s, in fact, as necessary as Littlefinger manipulating Lysa into intrigue, murder and ill-fated marriage was. Of course, without that manipulation Littlefinger would have never advanced at court and become Master of the Coin, Lord of Harrenhall and Sweetrobin&rsquo;s guardian. But none of these things were necessary to grant his survival at any time.</p><p>The key difference between Jon and Littlefinger is that Jon allies himself with Dany to ensure mankind&rsquo;s survival instead of personal gain. But on the balance, another difference between Littlefinger and Jon&rsquo;s situation is that the romantic relationship wasn&rsquo;t necessary to ensure Dany&rsquo;s support. In fact, even the idea that Dany&rsquo;s concerns are sign of her wavering in her commitment is a minority if not fringe opinion among GOT&rsquo;s audience.</p><p>And that makes the idea of Jon manipulating Dany very unpalatable. The lack of necessity makes him a Littlefinger, rather than a Robb or a Ned or even the Jon who lied to Ygritte. And audiences prefer to see their heroes as honorable fools rather than manipulative, emotionally abusive jerks.</p><p>Because there is the heart of the problem. If Jon is truly manipulating Dany, he is an emotionally abusive jerk. He is profoundly wrong. He is the guy that your BFF has warned you about. &ldquo;He is just using you for [something.]&rdquo;</p><p>And that hits home in a way shadowbabies and Frey Pies and Qyburn doesn&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t know any necromancers who vivisect people. But we know the kind of jerk that Jon would be. It&rsquo;s not theoretical, it&rsquo;s something we know and because of that will not appreciate.</p><p>***</p><p>But while this absolutely checks off&nbsp;&ldquo;make the evil deed painful to the audience&rdquo; point in the &ldquo;compelling villain&rdquo; check list, it&rsquo;s still nowhere near as ethically questionable as Stannis burning Shireen. <br /></p><p>But Jon&rsquo;s Ygritte storyline doesn&rsquo;t end with him duping, betraying and leaving her. It ends with her getting killed. And not just killed, but killed in battle against Jon and his brothers. While Jon is not directly responsible for her death &ndash; he neither instigated nor executed the killing &ndash; he was willing to risk that his actions would kill her in that battle. The goal of a battle is to win and to use the Patton quote from above &ldquo;make the other bastard die for his country.&rdquo; Of course, Jon acted in self-defense, Ygritte was fighting that battle against him and the NW voluntarily, fully willing, ready and able to kill him.</p><p>But then, to go back to Stannis, Stannis was also just acting in self-defense when he send the shadowbaby assassin to kill Renly. Renly had the superior force and showed himself fully willing, ready and able to kill Stannis in battle. The question whether Stannis&rsquo; assassination of Renly is justified is a digression too far because that is not the point. The point is that Jon and Stannis got some person killed who was really close to them (brother, lover) and that was kind of, maybe, perhaps justified self-defense. You can argue for it in both cases. </p><p>However, as I mentioned before, Stannis&rsquo; ultimate escalation of Renly&rsquo;s murder is killing Shireen. There is no maybe, perhaps, kind of, about the lack of justification for it. Stannis did not act in self-defense, Stannis was not provoked. The true necessity was also absent&hellip; although the proof for that is just hindsight. The sacrifice was supposed to save Stannis and his army. It did not. Thus it was never necessary. The whole thing is just wholly indefensible.</p><p>Now would an escalation of Jon&rsquo;s Ygritte storyline limit itself to the affair and betrayal or would it go all the way down to that self-defensive arrow that Jon wasn&rsquo;t directly responsible for? Except for a Stannis-like escalation that arrow could not be self-defensive, it would have to be undeserved, unjustified, unnecessary <i>and</i> Jon&rsquo;s responsibility. </p><p>The audience doesn&rsquo;t even have to like Dany at that point. That would be just crossing all moral event horizons, turning Jon into a villain and serving a &ldquo;<strike>King Arthur</strike> <strike>Aragorn</strike> Jon &nbsp;Snow is the final villain&rdquo; plot twist that makes R+L=J look like child&rsquo;s play in comparison. It would be truly an epic twist, ending up in the plot twist pantheon next to &ldquo;Bruce is a ghost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soylent Green&rdquo;.</p><p>However, I don&rsquo;t think this is gonna happen. A villain protagonist on that level would have been foreshadowed much, much more, both in the books and the show. &ldquo;The villain wins&rdquo; is also really nihilistic and ends up on a quite bitter note with very little sweetness. Davos, Brienne and Sam emerging alone from the rubble would be a more positive and happier ending. It&rsquo;s also the sort of plot twist you think of five books and seven TV seasons later (too late), not when you conceive the story. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p>So what will happen to Jon instead if he doesn&rsquo;t become a villain?</p><p>There are really only two options: his characterization remains in a class of its own and he remains the only truly good guy protagonist or he takes a level in realpolitik and starts to play as dirty as necessary in whatever way. Not quite Jon, the villain but Jon the ethically challenged, Jon the Utilitarian. <br /></p><p>(By the way, I am not saying that he has to play dirty with specific characters to qualify, just that that he has to play dirty somehow. In fact, playing dirty with certain characters might evoke a negative, emotional audience reaction that is not in proportion to the ethics violation it presents and thus the whole Utilitarianism bit might accidentally devolve into perceived villainy.)</p><p>The really fascinating bit about this is that Jon&rsquo;s characterization will define ASOIAF quite significantly. Jon is so crucial to the story&rsquo;s most fundamental conflict, that even if you discard the idea that he is <a href=\"http://blindestspot.tumblr.com/post/166182300140/aegon-his-is-the-song-of-ice-and-fire\">The Protagonist</a>, you would still have to agree that he is one of the most important protagonists. His characterization will contribute and lead to the resolution of that conflict. If he resolves it by playing dirty, the moral of the story will quite different than it is if he resolves it by always taking the heroic, high road. </p><p>And it&rsquo;s not just the moral of the story. Once the story decides to land on &ldquo;Jon, the moral&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jon, the Utilitarian&rdquo;, the question whether we are consuming &ldquo;Lord of the Rings with boobs&rdquo; or a true deconstruction of Lord of the Rings will answer itself. And that will reflect on more than just Jon&rsquo;s storyline. If Jon stays heroic, Night King Sauron, our final, two-dimensional villain and other neat and flat resolutions become much more likely.</p><p>As such I would argue that the Jon&rsquo;s characterization will define how good ASOIAF&rsquo;s famed realism truly is, what ideals it propagates, and what kind of story ASOIAF is. </p><p>I honestly can&rsquo;t predict how this will play out. But I remember that Ned and the Red Wedding promised a deconstruction of the genre, an acknowledgement that taking the high road constantly can be a dead end in real life. Jon not needing to be smarter than them in the end would break that promise. <br /></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Over the past year I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of asks about Jon and what I think is going on with him. During that time I&rsquo;ve also managed to calm down about the inconsistent number of redshirts during the Wight Hunt. Yes, I remember that this was a thing that happened, along with a bunch of other dei ex machina, like Cersei&rsquo;s brilliant strategies for everything, Jon&rsquo;s repeated, increasingly dumb survivals and the whole Winterfell plot. </p>\n<p>But calming down about them meant that I could think about Game of Thrones again in a manner that kind of naively assumes that the work is coherent . That 2+2=4, not 5, or orange, or a tiger. And this is what I think is going on with Jon and why it is so crucial to the whole work.<br /></p>\n</p>",

And when he opened his eyes,  he realized that he was lying in the snow, all dressed in black and  surrounded by weirwood trees. He got up with difficulty, a sharp pain in  his chest made his breathing difficult and within seconds he recognized  the place. This was the same godswood where he and Sam had said their  vows when they entered the Night\u2019s Watch. In the distance, above the top  of the trees, he could see that the Wall was still there, majestic and  imposing.</p><p>He tried to remember how he&rsquo;d come to that place.</p><p>He was in the great hall in Winterfell.</p><p>Daenerys was there. So did Arya, Bran, and Sansa. His family was together.</p><p>He was happy because the truth about his birth had been told him and  he finally knew who his parents were. Daenerys and he had decided that  it didn\u2019t matter that they were aunt and nephew, that their love was  more important. And besides, that same love had begotten the son Dany  now carried.</p><p>The Northern Lords were making a toast to the alliance between the  North and the Targaryen Queen, still oblivious that their King was, in  fact, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p><p>All the people who mattered to him were there, as well as his new  allies, preparing to fight the Night King and his army of dead and&hellip;  and then he began to feel a nuisance in his chest and this nuisance  became pain when he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Daenerys had supported him when his body collapsed and Sam had tried to help him&hellip; but then&hellip;</p><p>But then everything had gone dark and&hellip; and he had woken up in the forest beyond the Wall.</p><p>There was only one explanation for all that.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>He had been murdered.</p><p><i>\u00a0Again.  </i></p><p>&ldquo;No! No, no, no&hellip;&rdquo; he shouted &ldquo;I cannot die now!&rdquo; He fell to his  knees in the snow &ldquo;I just found a reason to keep on living, to keep  fighting &hellip; Dany. My Dany! I cannot die now. Right now that I found  her. I cannot leave her alone&hellip; I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll never be able to hold our son  in my arms. My son will never know the face of his father&hellip; just as I  didn\u2019t know the face of mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Footsteps caught his eye, and as he turned toward the sound, he found  himself in the company of a human-shaped being, but its body was  slender and its skin was red. Its hair was long and looked like the  flames of a fire, and wherever it passed, the snow around it melted. Its  form seemed to flicker as it walked, and Jon couldn\u2019t tell whether it  was a man or a woman. The stranger being stopped a few paces away and  Jon could feel the heat emanating from the being on his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you screaming?&rdquo; It said looking directly at Jon, and he realized that its eyes glittered like ember.</p><p>Jon got to his feet &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m angry. I finally found the love of my life and now I&rsquo;ve lost her forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to love her very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love her more than my own life. I had so little time to stand beside her. It&rsquo;s not fair that I die now that I&rsquo;ve found her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kings, commoners, men, women, young, old, rich, poor. Death takes all without distinction, Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo;</p><p>The being smiled &ldquo;I know the name of all those who come to this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where we are?&rdquo;</p><p>The being looked around &ldquo;We are in the space between life and death.  But you see it as the godswood where you uttered the Night\u2019s Watch vows.  It was in this place that you began your journey to save the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you&hellip; Who are you?&rdquo; Jon asked.</p><p>The being smiled and the fire in its eyes seemed to grow more  intense. &ldquo;I am the one who gave you back your life when those who  claimed to be your brothers took it away from you.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon stared at him, his mouth open, haunted &ldquo;Are you the Red God? R'hllor?&rdquo;</p><p>The being nodded. &ldquo;I am. I thought it would be nice to talk to you in person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I want from you? Is that still unclear?&rdquo;  R'hllor took another step toward Jon. &ldquo;You have not fulfilled your  destiny, Jon. You still have a very important role to play. I want you  to go back to the living world and get your place back. But just like  the other time, it&rsquo;s your decision to stay or come back. If you decide  to stay, mankind will have to try to survive the long night until the  three prophesies are reborn. If you decide to return, mankind will have a  chance to win. The Great War for the Dawn has begun and the Great Other  is getting stronger. You saw his servants with your own eyes, just like  the other two chosen. Three were prophesied, Jon. And without you, they  probably will not win this war. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What prophecy are you talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Daenerys Targaryen, Brandon Stark and you are the three heads of the  dragon. Together, you are Azor Ahai. Together you are the Prince who  was promised. You will defeat the servant of the Great Other and make  sure there will be another dawn. Brandon has access to all the knowledge  you need. Daenerys, bringing the dragons back to your world, reforged  the Lightbringer. And you have the strength and skills to help them  defeat the servants of the Great Other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One of your servants, Melisandre of Asshai, claimed that Stannis  Baratheon was the Prince that was promised, the Azor Ahai reborn and the  bearer of Lightbringer. She said all these prophecies referred to  Stannis. &rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Melisandre. Yes, my servant learned from her mistakes how much  prophecy can be dangerous. Something that mortals don\u2019t seem to  understand is that the signs of prophecy should not be interpreted  literally. Even with the visions I sent, my servant didn\u2019t follow the  path she should follow. She was blinded by her own pride and refused to  see what I showed her. I guided her to you and even then, she still  refused to see who you really were. When they took your life, I used  Melisandre as an instrument to resurrect you. Can you imagine my  frustration when, after getting the three promised to live at the same  time, one of them keep dying over and over again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I didn\u2019t have much control over it, did I?&rdquo; Said Jon,  indignant at the god&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to fight for my  life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are an honorable man and you believe that others can be that way  too. You believe that people can be good and trustworthy. And I even  like that about you, Jon. But once again you were killed because of it.  You trusted the wrong people and once again paid with your life for your  choices.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon could still feel the echo of the pain he had felt when the poison  had taken effect. &ldquo;I never imagined Cercei Lannister would be able to  have me killed after everything we showed her. But I couldn\u2019t lie, I had  already bent the knee and pledged the North to Daenerys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Correct reason. Wrong person.&rdquo; Jon looked at him confused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry to inform you that the person responsible for your death is much  closer to you than you can imagine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you implying that someone from my own people would try to kill  me after I&rsquo;ve got a gigantic army to fight on our side against the army  of the dead?&rdquo;</p><p>R'hllor shook his head, denying &ldquo;The person responsible for your  death thinks that you have usurped what by birthright should be hers and  only hers, the throne of North. And that with you being the heir to the  Iron Throne, she will never have a chance to be queen.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon looked at R'hllor in disbelief. &ldquo;No. That cannot be true. She would never&hellip; she&rsquo;s my sister!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Half sister, or rather, your cousin. And as she herself told you,  she learned many things from Cercei Lannister and Petyr Baelish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. That cannot be true. Please tell me you&rsquo;re wrong, she would not be able&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Jon, but this was not the first time she betrayed her own  family to be a queen. And this time she believes that everyone will  blame Jaime Lannister for your death and that she will get everything  she wants. After all, who would suspect the daughter of the honorable  Ned Stark? Who would accuse the King&rsquo;s sister of murdering him? With  your death, she thinks the North will hail her as Queen and that the  Lords will break the alliance with Daenerys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I trusted her&hellip;&rdquo; Jon&rsquo;s heart was devastated. First he had been  murdered by his Night\u2019s Watch brothers for doing what was right. And now  his sister had done the same. &ldquo;Is Dany in danger? Or Arya or Bran?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Everyone is alert. And it will not be long until the Three-Eyed Raven finds out who&rsquo;s the real culprit.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon breathed in relief.</p><p>R'hllor gently touched Jon&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;The time has come for you to  decide whether you want to go back and fight for humanity or if you want  to move on and have your well-deserved rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you need me to choose to stay or come back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Magic works only if you&rsquo;re willing to go back. If I tried to send  you back against your will, your body would work again, but your mind  would still be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember what happened here and everything you said to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, just like last time, you will not remember anything. But I  needed you to know all this before asking you to make a decision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will I still be myself when I return?&rdquo;</p><p>R'hllor smiled. &ldquo;Go back from the dead takes its toll, Jon. But don\u2019t  be afraid of what you might lose. Remember everything that awaits you  if you return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to keep fighting.&rdquo; Jon took a deep breath &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. You can send me back.&rdquo;</p><p>R'hllor nodded, pleased &ldquo;Before you get back, I have a gift for you.&rdquo;  he said and pointed to something in Jon&rsquo;s back, which looked back.</p><p>Jon had never seen those two people, but he would have recognized them anywhere.</p><p>The woman was much like Arya and a wreath of winter roses adorned her  long black hair. The man was slender and had silver curls and violet  eyes like his beloved Dany.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother. Father&rdquo; he said, touched, tears flooding his eyes.</p><p>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen smiled, walked up to him and wrapped him in their arms.</p><p>The feeling of being held by his parents was indescribable. &ldquo;I wish I had known you both.&rdquo; Jon said, wiping his tears away.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you grew up without us and not knowing who you really were.&rdquo; Lyanna said, her little hands clutching her son&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;We are so proud of you, my son!&rdquo; said Rhaegar.</p><p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I have so many questions!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the time will come when we will answer them all.&rdquo; said Rhaegar.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be grandparents!&rdquo; Jon said &ldquo;Daenerys is pregnant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You both deserve all the happiness the world can offer. Your fate has always been to find each other.&rdquo; said Lyanna.</p><p>&ldquo;Jon, you need to go now.&rdquo; R'hllor said.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always be with you, son.&rdquo; said his mother kissing his face.</p><p>&ldquo;We love you so much.&rdquo; Rhaegar said and hugged him once more.</p><p>The two then vanished and disappeared. Jon turned to R'hllor. &ldquo;What  did you tell me the first time for me to decide to come back?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said that Daenerys Targaryen was coming to meet you and that you would need each other&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon smiled. &ldquo;And now she and our son are waiting for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>The Red God raised his hand, passed it in front of Jon&rsquo;s face, and everything went dark again.</p><p>***</p><p>First, he heard her voice. She whispered softly about how she had  fallen in love with him in Dragonstone. Then the heat and pressure of  her body holding his. And then he felt the soft scent of lavender from  her skin and then her tears wetting his face. But it was only when he  opened his eyes and met her marvelous violet eyes that Jon knew he was  really home.</p>",

And when he opened his eyes,  he realized that he was lying in the snow, all dressed in black and  surrounded by weirwood trees. He got up with difficulty, a sharp pain in  his chest made his breathing difficult and within seconds he recognized  the place. This was the same godswood where he and Sam had said their  vows when they entered the Night\u2019s Watch. In the distance, above the top  of the trees, he could see that the Wall was still there, majestic and  imposing.</p><p>He tried to remember how he\u2019d come to that place.</p><p>He was in the great hall in Winterfell.</p><p>Daenerys was there. So did Arya, Bran, and Sansa. His family was together.</p><p>He was happy because the truth about his birth had been told him and  he finally knew who his parents were. Daenerys and he had decided that  it didn\u2019t matter that they were aunt and nephew, that their love was  more important. And besides, that same love had begotten the son Dany  now carried.</p><p>The Northern Lords were making a toast to the alliance between the  North and the Targaryen Queen, still oblivious that their King was, in  fact, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p><p>All the people who mattered to him were there, as well as his new  allies, preparing to fight the Night King and his army of dead and\u2026  and then he began to feel a nuisance in his chest and this nuisance  became pain when he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Daenerys had supported him when his body collapsed and Sam had tried to help him\u2026 but then\u2026</p><p>But then everything had gone dark and\u2026 and he had woken up in the forest beyond the Wall.</p><p>There was only one explanation for all that.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>He had been murdered.</p><p><i>\u00a0Again.  </i></p><p>\u201cNo! No, no, no\u2026\u201d he shouted \u201cI cannot die now!\u201d He fell to his  knees in the snow \u201cI just found a reason to keep on living, to keep  fighting \u2026 Dany. My Dany! I cannot die now. Right now that I found  her. I cannot leave her alone\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ll never be able to hold our son  in my arms. My son will never know the face of his father\u2026 just as I  didn\u2019t know the face of mine\u2026\u201d</p><p>Footsteps caught his eye, and as he turned toward the sound, he found  himself in the company of a human-shaped being, but its body was  slender and its skin was red. Its hair was long and looked like the  flames of a fire, and wherever it passed, the snow around it melted. Its  form seemed to flicker as it walked, and Jon couldn\u2019t tell whether it  was a man or a woman. The stranger being stopped a few paces away and  Jon could feel the heat emanating from the being on his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d It said looking directly at Jon, and he realized that its eyes glittered like ember.</p><p>Jon got to his feet \u201cBecause I\u2019m angry. I finally found the love of my life and now I\u2019ve lost her forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to love her very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her more than my own life. I had so little time to stand beside her. It\u2019s not fair that I die now that I\u2019ve found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKings, commoners, men, women, young, old, rich, poor. Death takes all without distinction, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>The being smiled \u201cI know the name of all those who come to this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we are?\u201d</p><p>The being looked around \u201cWe are in the space between life and death.  But you see it as the godswood where you uttered the Night\u2019s Watch vows.  It was in this place that you began your journey to save the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you\u2026 Who are you?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>The being smiled and the fire in its eyes seemed to grow more  intense. \u201cI am the one who gave you back your life when those who  claimed to be your brothers took it away from you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at him, his mouth open, haunted \u201cAre you the Red God? R'hllor?\u201d</p><p>The being nodded. \u201cI am. I thought it would be nice to talk to you in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I want from you? Is that still unclear?\u201d  R'hllor took another step toward Jon. \u201cYou have not fulfilled your  destiny, Jon. You still have a very important role to play. I want you  to go back to the living world and get your place back. But just like  the other time, it\u2019s your decision to stay or come back. If you decide  to stay, mankind will have to try to survive the long night until the  three prophesies are reborn. If you decide to return, mankind will have a  chance to win. The Great War for the Dawn has begun and the Great Other  is getting stronger. You saw his servants with your own eyes, just like  the other two chosen. Three were prophesied, Jon. And without you, they  probably will not win this war. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat prophecy are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen, Brandon Stark and you are the three heads of the  dragon. Together, you are Azor Ahai. Together you are the Prince who  was promised. You will defeat the servant of the Great Other and make  sure there will be another dawn. Brandon has access to all the knowledge  you need. Daenerys, bringing the dragons back to your world, reforged  the Lightbringer. And you have the strength and skills to help them  defeat the servants of the Great Other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your servants, Melisandre of Asshai, claimed that Stannis  Baratheon was the Prince that was promised, the Azor Ahai reborn and the  bearer of Lightbringer. She said all these prophecies referred to  Stannis. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMelisandre. Yes, my servant learned from her mistakes how much  prophecy can be dangerous. Something that mortals don\u2019t seem to  understand is that the signs of prophecy should not be interpreted  literally. Even with the visions I sent, my servant didn\u2019t follow the  path she should follow. She was blinded by her own pride and refused to  see what I showed her. I guided her to you and even then, she still  refused to see who you really were. When they took your life, I used  Melisandre as an instrument to resurrect you. Can you imagine my  frustration when, after getting the three promised to live at the same  time, one of them keep dying over and over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have much control over it, did I?\u201d Said Jon,  indignant at the god\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to fight for my  life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an honorable man and you believe that others can be that way  too. You believe that people can be good and trustworthy. And I even  like that about you, Jon. But once again you were killed because of it.  You trusted the wrong people and once again paid with your life for your  choices.\u201d</p><p>Jon could still feel the echo of the pain he had felt when the poison  had taken effect. \u201cI never imagined Cercei Lannister would be able to  have me killed after everything we showed her. But I couldn\u2019t lie, I had  already bent the knee and pledged the North to Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect reason. Wrong person.\u201d Jon looked at him confused. \u201cI\u2019m  sorry to inform you that the person responsible for your death is much  closer to you than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that someone from my own people would try to kill  me after I\u2019ve got a gigantic army to fight on our side against the army  of the dead?\u201d</p><p>R'hllor shook his head, denying \u201cThe person responsible for your  death thinks that you have usurped what by birthright should be hers and  only hers, the throne of North. And that with you being the heir to the  Iron Throne, she will never have a chance to be queen.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at R'hllor in disbelief. \u201cNo. That cannot be true. She would never\u2026 she\u2019s my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf sister, or rather, your cousin. And as she herself told you,  she learned many things from Cercei Lannister and Petyr Baelish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That cannot be true. Please tell me you\u2019re wrong, she would not be able\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jon, but this was not the first time she betrayed her own  family to be a queen. And this time she believes that everyone will  blame Jaime Lannister for your death and that she will get everything  she wants. After all, who would suspect the daughter of the honorable  Ned Stark? Who would accuse the King\u2019s sister of murdering him? With  your death, she thinks the North will hail her as Queen and that the  Lords will break the alliance with Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted her\u2026\u201d Jon\u2019s heart was devastated. First he had been  murdered by his Night\u2019s Watch brothers for doing what was right. And now  his sister had done the same. \u201cIs Dany in danger? Or Arya or Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everyone is alert. And it will not be long until the Three-Eyed Raven finds out who\u2019s the real culprit.\u201d</p><p>Jon breathed in relief.</p><p>R'hllor gently touched Jon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe time has come for you to  decide whether you want to go back and fight for humanity or if you want  to move on and have your well-deserved rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need me to choose to stay or come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic works only if you\u2019re willing to go back. If I tried to send  you back against your will, your body would work again, but your mind  would still be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember what happened here and everything you said to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just like last time, you will not remember anything. But I  needed you to know all this before asking you to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I still be myself when I return?\u201d</p><p>R'hllor smiled. \u201cGo back from the dead takes its toll, Jon.

I had so little time to stand beside her. It\u2019s not fair that I die now that I\u2019ve found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKings, commoners, men, women, young, old, rich, poor. Death takes all without distinction, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>The being smiled \u201cI know the name of all those who come to this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we are?\u201d</p><p>The being looked around \u201cWe are in the space between life and death.  But you see it as the godswood where you uttered the Night\u2019s Watch vows.  It was in this place that you began your journey to save the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you\u2026 Who are you?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>The being smiled and the fire in its eyes seemed to grow more  intense. \u201cI am the one who gave you back your life when those who  claimed to be your brothers took it away from you.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared at him, his mouth open, haunted \u201cAre you the Red God? R'hllor?\u201d</p><p>The being nodded. \u201cI am. I thought it would be nice to talk to you in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I want from you? Is that still unclear?\u201d  R'hllor took another step toward Jon. \u201cYou have not fulfilled your  destiny, Jon. You still have a very important role to play. I want you  to go back to the living world and get your place back. But just like  the other time, it\u2019s your decision to stay or come back. If you decide  to stay, mankind will have to try to survive the long night until the  three prophesies are reborn. If you decide to return, mankind will have a  chance to win. The Great War for the Dawn has begun and the Great Other  is getting stronger. You saw his servants with your own eyes, just like  the other two chosen. Three were prophesied, Jon. And without you, they  probably will not win this war. \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat prophecy are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaenerys Targaryen, Brandon Stark and you are the three heads of the  dragon. Together, you are Azor Ahai. Together you are the Prince who  was promised. You will defeat the servant of the Great Other and make  sure there will be another dawn. Brandon has access to all the knowledge  you need. Daenerys, bringing the dragons back to your world, reforged  the Lightbringer. And you have the strength and skills to help them  defeat the servants of the Great Other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your servants, Melisandre of Asshai, claimed that Stannis  Baratheon was the Prince that was promised, the Azor Ahai reborn and the  bearer of Lightbringer. She said all these prophecies referred to  Stannis. \u201d</p><p>\u201cMelisandre. Yes, my servant learned from her mistakes how much  prophecy can be dangerous. Something that mortals don\u2019t seem to  understand is that the signs of prophecy should not be interpreted  literally. Even with the visions I sent, my servant didn\u2019t follow the  path she should follow. She was blinded by her own pride and refused to  see what I showed her. I guided her to you and even then, she still  refused to see who you really were. When they took your life, I used  Melisandre as an instrument to resurrect you. Can you imagine my  frustration when, after getting the three promised to live at the same  time, one of them keep dying over and over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t have much control over it, did I?\u201d Said Jon,  indignant at the god\u2019s words. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to fight for my  life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an honorable man and you believe that others can be that way  too. You believe that people can be good and trustworthy. And I even  like that about you, Jon. But once again you were killed because of it.  You trusted the wrong people and once again paid with your life for your  choices.\u201d</p><p>Jon could still feel the echo of the pain he had felt when the poison  had taken effect. \u201cI never imagined Cercei Lannister would be able to  have me killed after everything we showed her. But I couldn\u2019t lie, I had  already bent the knee and pledged the North to Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect reason. Wrong person.\u201d Jon looked at him confused. \u201cI\u2019m  sorry to inform you that the person responsible for your death is much  closer to you than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that someone from my own people would try to kill  me after I\u2019ve got a gigantic army to fight on our side against the army  of the dead?\u201d</p><p>R'hllor shook his head, denying \u201cThe person responsible for your  death thinks that you have usurped what by birthright should be hers and  only hers, the throne of North. And that with you being the heir to the  Iron Throne, she will never have a chance to be queen.\u201d</p><p>Jon looked at R'hllor in disbelief. \u201cNo. That cannot be true. She would never\u2026 she\u2019s my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf sister, or rather, your cousin. And as she herself told you,  she learned many things from Cercei Lannister and Petyr Baelish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That cannot be true. Please tell me you\u2019re wrong, she would not be able\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Jon, but this was not the first time she betrayed her own  family to be a queen. And this time she believes that everyone will  blame Jaime Lannister for your death and that she will get everything  she wants. After all, who would suspect the daughter of the honorable  Ned Stark? Who would accuse the King\u2019s sister of murdering him? With  your death, she thinks the North will hail her as Queen and that the  Lords will break the alliance with Daenerys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted her\u2026\u201d Jon\u2019s heart was devastated. First he had been  murdered by his Night\u2019s Watch brothers for doing what was right. And now  his sister had done the same. \u201cIs Dany in danger? Or Arya or Bran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everyone is alert. And it will not be long until the Three-Eyed Raven finds out who\u2019s the real culprit.\u201d</p><p>Jon breathed in relief.</p><p>R'hllor gently touched Jon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThe time has come for you to  decide whether you want to go back and fight for humanity or if you want  to move on and have your well-deserved rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need me to choose to stay or come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic works only if you\u2019re willing to go back. If I tried to send  you back against your will, your body would work again, but your mind  would still be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember what happened here and everything you said to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just like last time, you will not remember anything. But I  needed you to know all this before asking you to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I still be myself when I return?\u201d</p><p>R'hllor smiled. \u201cGo back from the dead takes its toll, Jon. But don\u2019t  be afraid of what you might lose. Remember everything that awaits you  if you return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to keep fighting.\u201d Jon took a deep breath \u201cI\u2019m ready. You can send me back.\u201d</p><p>R'hllor nodded, pleased \u201cBefore you get back, I have a gift for you.\u201d  he said and pointed to something in Jon\u2019s back, which looked back.</p><p>Jon had never seen those two people, but he would have recognized them anywhere.</p><p>The woman was much like Arya and a wreath of winter roses adorned her  long black hair. The man was slender and had silver curls and violet  eyes like his beloved Dany.</p><p>\u201cMother. Father\u201d he said, touched, tears flooding his eyes.</p><p>Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen smiled, walked up to him and wrapped him in their arms.</p><p>The feeling of being held by his parents was indescribable. \u201cI wish I had known you both.\u201d Jon said, wiping his tears away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you grew up without us and not knowing who you really were.\u201d Lyanna said, her little hands clutching her son\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWe are so proud of you, my son!\u201d said Rhaegar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2026 I have so many questions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the time will come when we will answer them all.\u201d said Rhaegar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be grandparents!\u201d Jon said \u201cDaenerys is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both deserve all the happiness the world can offer. Your fate has always been to find each other.\u201d said Lyanna.</p><p>\u201cJon, you need to go now.\u201d R'hllor said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll always be with you, son.\u201d said his mother kissing his face.</p><p>\u201cWe love you so much.\u201d Rhaegar said and hugged him once more.</p><p>The two then vanished and disappeared. Jon turned to R'hllor. \u201cWhat  did you tell me the first time for me to decide to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that Daenerys Targaryen was coming to meet you and that you would need each other\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled. \u201cAnd now she and our son are waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The Red God raised his hand, passed it in front of Jon\u2019s face, and everything went dark again.</p><p>***</p><p>First, he heard her voice. She whispered softly about how she had  fallen in love with him in Dragonstone. Then the heat and pressure of  her body holding his. And then he felt the soft scent of lavender from  her skin and then her tears wetting his face. But it was only when he  opened his eyes and met her marvelous violet eyes that Jon knew he was  really home.</p></p>",

And when he opened his eyes,  he realized that he was lying in the snow, all dressed in black and  surrounded by weirwood trees. He got up with difficulty, a sharp pain in  his chest made his breathing difficult and within seconds he recognized  the place. This was the same godswood where he and Sam had said their  vows when they entered the Night&rsquo;s Watch. In the distance, above the top  of the trees, he could see that the Wall was still there, majestic and  imposing.</p><p>He tried to remember how he&rsquo;d come to that place.</p><p>He was in the great hall in Winterfell.</p><p>Daenerys was there. So did Arya, Bran, and Sansa. His family was together.</p><p>He was happy because the truth about his birth had been told him and  he finally knew who his parents were. Daenerys and he had decided that  it didn&rsquo;t matter that they were aunt and nephew, that their love was  more important. And besides, that same love had begotten the son Dany  now carried.</p><p>The Northern Lords were making a toast to the alliance between the  North and the Targaryen Queen, still oblivious that their King was, in  fact, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.</p><p>All the people who mattered to him were there, as well as his new  allies, preparing to fight the Night King and his army of dead and&hellip;  and then he began to feel a nuisance in his chest and this nuisance  became pain when he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p><p>Daenerys had supported him when his body collapsed and Sam had tried to help him&hellip; but then&hellip;</p><p>But then everything had gone dark and&hellip; and he had woken up in the forest beyond the Wall.</p><p>There was only one explanation for all that.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>He had been murdered.</p><p><i>&nbsp;Again.  </i></p><p>&ldquo;No! No, no, no&hellip;&rdquo; he shouted &ldquo;I cannot die now!&rdquo; He fell to his  knees in the snow &ldquo;I just found a reason to keep on living, to keep  fighting &hellip; Dany. My Dany! I cannot die now. Right now that I found  her. I cannot leave her alone&hellip; I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll never be able to hold our son  in my arms. My son will never know the face of his father&hellip; just as I  didn&rsquo;t know the face of mine&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Footsteps caught his eye, and as he turned toward the sound, he found  himself in the company of a human-shaped being, but its body was  slender and its skin was red. Its hair was long and looked like the  flames of a fire, and wherever it passed, the snow around it melted. Its  form seemed to flicker as it walked, and Jon couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it  was a man or a woman. The stranger being stopped a few paces away and  Jon could feel the heat emanating from the being on his skin.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you screaming?&rdquo; It said looking directly at Jon, and he realized that its eyes glittered like ember.</p><p>Jon got to his feet &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m angry. I finally found the love of my life and now I&rsquo;ve lost her forever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to love her very much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I love her more than my own life. I had so little time to stand beside her. It&rsquo;s not fair that I die now that I&rsquo;ve found her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kings, commoners, men, women, young, old, rich, poor. Death takes all without distinction, Jon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo;</p><p>The being smiled &ldquo;I know the name of all those who come to this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where we are?&rdquo;</p><p>The being looked around &ldquo;We are in the space between life and death.  But you see it as the godswood where you uttered the Night&rsquo;s Watch vows.
