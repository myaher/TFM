        "question": "Do you think Sandra had a good interview? She basically said eve snaps out of her delusion which is her relationship with v and she\u2019s going to try and work on her marriage with Niko!",
        "answer": "<p>So the first thing that sticks out to me in that interview is that Sandra frequently emphasizes that they haven\u2019t actually figured out most of the season 3 plot. So I think we need to take everything she says in this interview with a grain of salt, because even though Sandra does have some creative control, she\u2019s not the only one, and she could very well change her mind about the way she wants things to go through discussions with Suzanne, Sally, Jodie, etc.<br/></p><p>That said, I don\u2019t think her \u201csnapping out of the delusion\u201d was referring to her having a relationship with Villanelle so much as this particular <i>type </i>of relationship she\u2019s had with her over the course of the second half of the season. Here\u2019s the quote:</p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s against Eve\u2019s nature to <i>really </i>be like Villanelle, to go off on some fantasy. That\u2019s the brutal lesson; Eve kind of wakes up from this thing. It\u2019s like \u201cOh, this whole time I was really just kind of deluding myself.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Eve has essentially been trying to have it all\u2013her job, her relationship with Niko, her control over Villanelle as a pawn in her plan to take down Aaron, and her role as the object of Villanelle\u2019s affections. And we see her act in increasingly heartless ways in order to keep all of these balls in the air. But as Sandra emphasizes, Eve can\u2019t be <i>really </i>like Villanelle, in that she can\u2019t keep hurting the people around her without eventually feeling remorse. I think that\u2019s the delusion that she is waking up from here. It would be completely out of character for Eve to go from \u201ctrouble\u2019s not interested in me\u201d (S1E1) to leaving behind everything she\u2019s ever known and running away with Villanelle to Alaska in the course of 16 episodes. But for a moment she allows herself to consider doing that, and then seeing how Villanelle has manipulated her reminds her who Villanelle really is and the rational side of her brain kicks in. So I don\u2019t believe the delusion here that she refers to is her attraction to Villanelle in general, but more the way she\u2019s been deluding herself about her own behavior and choices.

But it still doesn\u2019t bother her enough to walk away completely (at least until the very last scene of S2).

I think if/when Eve finally does end up with Villanelle, we need to have a sense that the circumstances of her life and of the relationship make it completely inevitable, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.
