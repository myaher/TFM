He was cool and mysterious meanwhile you were just boring old you.</p><p><b>\u201cHow could I ever forget about you?\u201d</b> he asked laughing a bit\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the girl who spilled butterbeer all over herself on the last hogsmeade trip.\u201d<br/></p><p>Of course that\u2019s how he remembered you, you wanted to crawl into a hole and never come out.</p><p>\u201cE-Excuse me.\u201d you quickly hurried past him as you heard a few people that had been nearby snickering.<br/></p><p>Sirius watched you go as confusion crossed his face, he had only meant it as an ice breaker of sorts, he hadn\u2019t meant to upset you.\u2019<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2661\n\n\n\n\u2661\n\n\n\n\u2661\n\n<br/></p><p>Come lunch you could feel that your hunger growing thanks to not having ate anything that morning, sitting down at your houses table once again you took one of the sandwiches supplied and at it quietly as you kept an eye on the ceiling seeing as you weren\u2019t too interested in the conversation your friends were having across the table.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you listening?\u201d your friend Fiona\u2019s voice suddenly reached you.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh yeah, totally.\u201d you tried to play it off like you had been listening.<br/></p><p>\u201cSo you agree, Sirius is the cutest guy in our year.\u201d your other friend Jamie grinned triumphantly.<br/></p><p>You choked on the bite you had just taken, was he haunting you or something?!</p><p>Grabbing your water you quickly downed some as you coughed trying to catch your breath\u00a0\u201cWhy on earth are we talking about something like that?!\u201d.</p><p>\u201cTold you he wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d Jamie snickered\u00a0\u201cAnd we are talking about it since we find them attractive.\u201d<br/></p><p>You sighed as you finished your sandwich\u00a0\u201cAttractive or not, everyone know James and Lily are gonna end up together, Remus is dating his studies, Peter is well, he\u2019s Peter, and Sirius is-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d Sirius cut you off siting beside you.<br/></p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin, meanwhile your two friends seemed to be trying to play it cool.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He asked smirking in your direction<br/></p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re&hellip;\u201d you could feel yourself shaking, why was he here?!<br/></p><p>You felt yourself beginning to slip into a full blown anxiety attack as the room began to spin and your hands suddenly felt tingly despite how tightly you were holding onto your skirt.</p><p>Sirius however, seemed to immediately recognize this\u00a0\u201c(L/N) calm down, i\u2019m not upset.\u201d his voice barely making it you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re..you\u2019re not?\u201d you managed as you closed your eyes to stop the room from spinning.<br/></p><p>\u201cOf course, but (L/N) <b>you need to see a doctor </b>about your anxiety.\u201d he stated almost seeming as if he was worried about you.<br/></p><p>\u201cAnxiety?\u201d Fiona chimed in curiously\u00a0\u201cYou have anxiety (F/N)?\u201d.<br/></p><p>Your heart dropped into your stomach, so much for hiding it, but at least they didn\u2019t know about your meds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really.\u201d you lied\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll send a owl home about it.\u201d another lie.<br/></p><p>This seemed to please your friends, but Sirius still looked skeptical, yet before he could retaliate his friends were calling to him and left with a wave.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you chummy with Sirius?\u201d Jamie asked leaning towards you in anticipation.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not chummy with him.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cCan we just get to potions now before were stuck behind Balski, Avers, and Kenton again?\u201d.<br/></p><p>They both gave a shrug before the the three of you made your war towards class.</p><p>Approaching the classroom the three of you spotted the unthinkable, the marauders were already there as well which was weird seeing as they were usually the last to arrive</p><p>\u201cThis is getting weird..\u201d you mumbled as you held your textbook closer to your chest<br/></p><p>\u201cTwo times in a day.\u201d Jamie added<br/></p><p>\u201cThree actually..\u201d you slumped against the cold wall as you raked a hand through your hair\u00a0<br/></p><p>The four seemed to finally notice the three of you, you could feel Sirius\u2019s eyes on you which made you shift uneasily\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMudblood.\u201d someone called and out of instinct you turned to see who said it.<br/></p><p>Avers had just entered the dungeon and didn\u2019t look too pleased</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth Avers.\u201d you heard Sirius growl.<br/></p><p>The color drained from Avers face as he looked to see the marauders not standing too far away\u00a0\u201cOr what Black?\u201d his voice was shaky despite him trying to put on a tough guy act.</p><p>\u201cOh I could think of a few things.\u201d the marauder growled in response beginning to move towards the slytherin<br/></p><p>You quickly moved between the two of them\u00a0\u201cSirius don\u2019t, that\u2019s what he wants.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAwe the mudblood is trying to protect you how cu-\u201d you didn\u2019t know why, but before Avers could finish his sentence your hand had met his right cheek out of anger.<br/></p><p>Sure you had felt anger towards him before, but you had been too scared to act on it</p><p>\u201cL-Leave him out of this!\u201d you managed as your hands balled into fists.<br/></p><p>Behind you Sirius had a mixture of shock and pride on his face\u00a0</p><p>Avers went to grab your arm, but luckily or you Slughorn had just walked out of his classroom\u00a0\u201cWhat is going on out here?!\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201c(L/N) hit me!\u201d Avers tattled like he was back in primary school.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou called her a mudblood!\u201d Jamie piped up<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Peter echoed from beside Sirius.<br/></p><p>\u201cIs this true Mr.Avers?\u201d Slughorn asked sounding disappointed\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to have to deduct ten points from slytherin for this.\u201d.<br/></p><p>\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Avers growled clearly enraged\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong here professor, she-\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI suggest you hold your tongue young man before you become the sole purpose slytherin loses the house cup this year.\u201d your professor warned.<br/></p><p>You watched as Avers stormed out of the dungeons mumbling threats under his breath as more students began to arrive.</p><p>Sighing you finally looked back to Sirius once you were inside the classroom\u00a0\u201cThanks for standing up for me back there..\u201d.</p><p>He laughed lightly\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like you needed my help though.\u201d.</p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have retaliated like that if he hadn\u2019t brought you into it. It\u2019s one thing for him to mess with me over something as silly as being muggle born, but it\u2019s another for him to attack innocent people who were just trying to help me.\u201d.</p><p>He frowned\u00a0\u201c(L/N) you know you don\u2019t deserve any of this right?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded despite the nagging voice in the back of your head\u00a0\u201cYeah..I sh-\u201d you wee stopped by Sirius\u2019s hand grabbing yours.</p><p><b>\u201cJust smile, I really need to see you smile right now.\u201d</b> he spoke softly, his gray eyes looking into your (E/C) ones.</p><p>You felt your face heat up from the direct contact and managed to give him a small shy smile\u00a0\u2018People are staring..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you look beautiful when you smile.\u201d he smirked and kissed your hand before letting it go.<br/></p><p>You quickly walked back to your desk feeling your face buning, Jamie and Fiona were on either side of you both quietly squealing as they leaned closer to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be the maid of honor at your wedding right?\u201d Fiona joked.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo me!\u201d Jamie whined.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both horrible.\u201d you said sliding down in your chair hiding your face.<br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \n\n<br/></p><p>Weeks had past since the incident and seeing as it was Christmas break, the school was the quietest it ever was which you found to be soothing as you let yourself wonder around the school grounds. You soon came across the whomping willow and admired it from a distance, the violent tree was beautiful, but deadly and preferred life over being pummeled into the ground.</p><p>Hearing a bark you looked around to see a big black dog bounding towards you, you threw your arms up to protect yourself, however when nothing came you slowly lowered them to see the dog simply sitting in front of you with it\u2019s long tongue hanging out of it\u2019s mouth as his mouth was open almost like he was smiling- or her- you weren\u2019t even gonna attempt to check.</p><p>\u201cHello there.\u201d you said slowly bringing you hand out for the dog to sniff.<br/></p><p>He gave it a sniff before licking it which made you laugh\u00a0\u201cWell you\u2019re awfully friendly aren\u2019t you?\u201d scratching under his chin you looked around\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know dogs were allowed here..Are you a stray? Can strays even get on the school grounds?\u201d</p><p>The dog barked again ceasing your questions\u00a0\u201cSorry puppy, just thinking out loud.\u201d sighing you too walking over to a bench and moved the snow before sitting down.</p><p>The dog followed and hopped up beside you\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t have anywhere to go for Christmas either?\u201d you asked.</p><p>The dog tilted his head as if he was confused</p><p>\u201cMy parents are overseas right now seeing my sick grandmother in the states.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cThey were gonna take me too, but I told them it would be too much trouble and that Father needed to be with grandmother during her possibly last few days.\u201d<br/></p><p>the dogs head dropped into your lap as he gave a almost sympathetic sounding whine.</p><p>You stroked his head\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me boy, i\u2019ll be okay, i\u2019m used to being alone anyway.\u201d</p><p>he didn\u2019t seem to like this answer and grabbed your bag before jumping off the bench\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Puppy give that back!\u201d you called as the dog began to run away and thus the chase began<br/></p><p>However about ten minutes later you had lost the dog and felt like your chest was burning from all the cold air you had breathed in</p><p>\u201c(L/N)?\u201d a familiar voice spoke\u00a0<br/></p><p>You looked up to see James and Sirius walking towards you, your bag in Sirius\u2019s hands</p><p>\u201cMy bag!\u201d you said upon seeing it and quickly took it when Sirius handed it over\u00a0\u201cThank you so much, a dog came and ran off with it.\u201d.<br/></p><p>James chuckled\u00a0\u201cSeems like he was a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>You could have sworn you seen Sirius shoot James a death glare</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here? I thought you were going home for Christmas.\u201d you asked knowing Sirius lived with Potter\u2019s now.<br/></p><p>\u201cWell we found your bag and wanted to return it before we left, but aren\u2019t you doing home too?\u201d Sirius asked<br/></p><p>\u201cNo i\u2019m staying here, family stuff and all, but i\u2019ll be okay alone.\u201d you assured them.<br/></p><p>James frowned\u00a0\u201cNobody should be alone on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>You gave a shrug\u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, don\u2019t have any family to go to this year.\u201d</p><p>Sirius and James looked to each other before they both spoke at the same time\u00a0\u201cCome with us than.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both insane..\u201d you looked at them in surprise\u00a0\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>Sirius shrugged\u00a0\u201cThan we get to know each other better over the holiday!\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry (L/N), my parents will love you.\u201d James added<br/></p><p>Before you could protest the two were pulling you along with them and before you knew it your bag was packed and you were heading to the Potters residence\u00a0</p><p>You thumbed through a book you had brought to distract yourself, your leg anxiously bouncing despite your internal protest</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d Sirius asked from across the carriage where he sat.<br/></p><p>\u201cThat obvious?\u201d you sighed as you sat your book down<br/></p><p>You looked to see James was asleep against the wall, his glasses askew. Getting to your feet you walked over and took them off him before placing them on the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really nice (L/N).\u201d Sirius said as he watched you take a blanket from your bag and put it on James.<br/></p><p>\u201cHuman decency.\u201d you shrugged\u00a0\u201cMy parents raised me to treat others like how I wish to be treated, but to also know right from wrong to keep myself from getting hurt.\u201d.</p><p>You sat back down and opened your bag absentmindedly taking out your antidepressants to take one seeing a you had forgot that morning</p><p>\u201cYou take antidepressants?\u201d Sirius asked and you froze<br/></p><p>\u201cY-Yeah..I have since this summer.\u201d you said going to put the medicine back.<br/></p><p><b>\u201cTake your medicine.\u201d</b> he said handing you his pumpkin juice he had purchased.<br/></p><p>You nodded and thanked him before doing as he told you</p><p>\u201cI take them too.\u201d he said as you handed back the drink.<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked surprised.<br/></p><p>He nodded\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the wizard alternative, but it\u2019s still the same thing.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cGuess were both battling our own demons.\u201d you laughed a bit.<br/></p><p>\u201cNot alone though.\u201d he gave you a small smile\u00a0\u201cJames and his family have really helped me to learn i\u2019m not alone&hellip;Maybe that\u2019s why i\u2019m so drawn to you.\u201d.<br/></p><p>You tilted your head like the dog had earlier and Sirius couldn\u2019t help, but laugh, and your poor heart was ready to leap out of your chest at the beautiful sound.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just..The more i\u2019ve been around you the more i\u2019m seeing the real you, and I can tell you\u2019re unhappy.\u201d he sighed\u00a0\u201cIf I had it my way i\u2019d put an end to the dark lord\u2019s army and maybe then all this blood talk finally wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cThey\u2019re monsters.\u201d</b> you added as you looked down to your lap\u00a0\u201cWho could obey such an evil man..?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMy family.\u201d he stated, no emotion in his voice.<br/></p><p>\u201cSirius I didn\u2019t-\u201d you began, but he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright (L/N), not like you asked about them, it was my choice to mention them.\u201d he looked to the window<br/></p><p>You sighed\u00a0\u2018Way to go idiot, why do you even speak?\u2019 you thought picking your book back up</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \n\n<br/></p>",

He was cool and mysterious meanwhile you were just boring old you.</p><p><b>\u201cHow could I ever forget about you?\u201d</b> he asked laughing a bit\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re the girl who spilled butterbeer all over herself on the last hogsmeade trip.\u201d<br></p><p>Of course that\u2019s how he remembered you, you wanted to crawl into a hole and never come out.</p><p>\u201cE-Excuse me.\u201d you quickly hurried past him as you heard a few people that had been nearby snickering.<br></p><p>Sirius watched you go as confusion crossed his face, he had only meant it as an ice breaker of sorts, he hadn\u2019t meant to upset you.\u2019<br></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2661\n\n\n\n\u2661\n\n\n\n\u2661\n\n<br></p><p>Come lunch you could feel that your hunger growing thanks to not having ate anything that morning, sitting down at your houses table once again you took one of the sandwiches supplied and at it quietly as you kept an eye on the ceiling seeing as you weren\u2019t too interested in the conversation your friends were having across the table.</p><p>\u201c(Y/N) are you listening?\u201d your friend Fiona\u2019s voice suddenly reached you.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh yeah, totally.\u201d you tried to play it off like you had been listening.<br></p><p>\u201cSo you agree, Sirius is the cutest guy in our year.\u201d your other friend Jamie grinned triumphantly.<br></p><p>You choked on the bite you had just taken, was he haunting you or something?!</p><p>Grabbing your water you quickly downed some as you coughed trying to catch your breath\u00a0\u201cWhy on earth are we talking about something like that?!\u201d.</p><p>\u201cTold you he wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d Jamie snickered\u00a0\u201cAnd we are talking about it since we find them attractive.\u201d<br></p><p>You sighed as you finished your sandwich\u00a0\u201cAttractive or not, everyone know James and Lily are gonna end up together, Remus is dating his studies, Peter is well, he\u2019s Peter, and Sirius is-\u201d\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d Sirius cut you off siting beside you.<br></p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin, meanwhile your two friends seemed to be trying to play it cool.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He asked smirking in your direction<br></p><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re\u2026\u201d you could feel yourself shaking, why was he here?!<br></p><p>You felt yourself beginning to slip into a full blown anxiety attack as the room began to spin and your hands suddenly felt tingly despite how tightly you were holding onto your skirt.</p><p>Sirius however, seemed to immediately recognize this\u00a0\u201c(L/N) calm down, i\u2019m not upset.\u201d his voice barely making it you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re..you\u2019re not?\u201d you managed as you closed your eyes to stop the room from spinning.<br></p><p>\u201cOf course, but (L/N) <b>you need to see a doctor </b>about your anxiety.\u201d he stated almost seeming as if he was worried about you.<br></p><p>\u201cAnxiety?\u201d Fiona chimed in curiously\u00a0\u201cYou have anxiety (F/N)?\u201d.<br></p><p>Your heart dropped into your stomach, so much for hiding it, but at least they didn\u2019t know about your meds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really.\u201d you lied\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll send a owl home about it.\u201d another lie.<br></p><p>This seemed to please your friends, but Sirius still looked skeptical, yet before he could retaliate his friends were calling to him and left with a wave.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you chummy with Sirius?\u201d Jamie asked leaning towards you in anticipation.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not chummy with him.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cCan we just get to potions now before were stuck behind Balski, Avers, and Kenton again?\u201d.<br></p><p>They both gave a shrug before the the three of you made your war towards class.</p><p>Approaching the classroom the three of you spotted the unthinkable, the marauders were already there as well which was weird seeing as they were usually the last to arrive</p><p>\u201cThis is getting weird..\u201d you mumbled as you held your textbook closer to your chest<br></p><p>\u201cTwo times in a day.\u201d Jamie added<br></p><p>\u201cThree actually..\u201d you slumped against the cold wall as you raked a hand through your hair\u00a0<br></p><p>The four seemed to finally notice the three of you, you could feel Sirius\u2019s eyes on you which made you shift uneasily\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMudblood.\u201d someone called and out of instinct you turned to see who said it.<br></p><p>Avers had just entered the dungeon and didn\u2019t look too pleased</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth Avers.\u201d you heard Sirius growl.<br></p><p>The color drained from Avers face as he looked to see the marauders not standing too far away\u00a0\u201cOr what Black?\u201d his voice was shaky despite him trying to put on a tough guy act.</p><p>\u201cOh I could think of a few things.\u201d the marauder growled in response beginning to move towards the slytherin<br></p><p>You quickly moved between the two of them\u00a0\u201cSirius don\u2019t, that\u2019s what he wants.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAwe the mudblood is trying to protect you how cu-\u201d you didn\u2019t know why, but before Avers could finish his sentence your hand had met his right cheek out of anger.<br></p><p>Sure you had felt anger towards him before, but you had been too scared to act on it</p><p>\u201cL-Leave him out of this!\u201d you managed as your hands balled into fists.<br></p><p>Behind you Sirius had a mixture of shock and pride on his face\u00a0</p><p>Avers went to grab your arm, but luckily or you Slughorn had just walked out of his classroom\u00a0\u201cWhat is going on out here?!\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201c(L/N) hit me!\u201d Avers tattled like he was back in primary school.<br></p><p>\u201cYou called her a mudblood!\u201d Jamie piped up<br></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Peter echoed from beside Sirius.<br></p><p>\u201cIs this true Mr.Avers?\u201d Slughorn asked sounding disappointed\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to have to deduct ten points from slytherin for this.\u201d.<br></p><p>\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Avers growled clearly enraged\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong here professor, she-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI suggest you hold your tongue young man before you become the sole purpose slytherin loses the house cup this year.\u201d your professor warned.<br></p><p>You watched as Avers stormed out of the dungeons mumbling threats under his breath as more students began to arrive.</p><p>Sighing you finally looked back to Sirius once you were inside the classroom\u00a0\u201cThanks for standing up for me back there..\u201d.</p><p>He laughed lightly\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like you needed my help though.\u201d.</p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have retaliated like that if he hadn\u2019t brought you into it. It\u2019s one thing for him to mess with me over something as silly as being muggle born, but it\u2019s another for him to attack innocent people who were just trying to help me.\u201d.</p><p>He frowned\u00a0\u201c(L/N) you know you don\u2019t deserve any of this right?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded despite the nagging voice in the back of your head\u00a0\u201cYeah..I sh-\u201d you wee stopped by Sirius\u2019s hand grabbing yours.</p><p><b>\u201cJust smile, I really need to see you smile right now.\u201d</b> he spoke softly, his gray eyes looking into your (E/C) ones.</p><p>You felt your face heat up from the direct contact and managed to give him a small shy smile\u00a0\u2018People are staring..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you look beautiful when you smile.\u201d he smirked and kissed your hand before letting it go.<br></p><p>You quickly walked back to your desk feeling your face buning, Jamie and Fiona were on either side of you both quietly squealing as they leaned closer to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be the maid of honor at your wedding right?\u201d Fiona joked.<br></p><p>\u201cNo me!\u201d Jamie whined.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both horrible.\u201d you said sliding down in your chair hiding your face.<br></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \n\n<br></p><p>Weeks had past since the incident and seeing as it was Christmas break, the school was the quietest it ever was which you found to be soothing as you let yourself wonder around the school grounds. You soon came across the whomping willow and admired it from a distance, the violent tree was beautiful, but deadly and preferred life over being pummeled into the ground.</p><p>Hearing a bark you looked around to see a big black dog bounding towards you, you threw your arms up to protect yourself, however when nothing came you slowly lowered them to see the dog simply sitting in front of you with it\u2019s long tongue hanging out of it\u2019s mouth as his mouth was open almost like he was smiling- or her- you weren\u2019t even gonna attempt to check.</p><p>\u201cHello there.\u201d you said slowly bringing you hand out for the dog to sniff.<br></p><p>He gave it a sniff before licking it which made you laugh\u00a0\u201cWell you\u2019re awfully friendly aren\u2019t you?\u201d scratching under his chin you looked around\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know dogs were allowed here..Are you a stray? Can strays even get on the school grounds?\u201d</p><p>The dog barked again ceasing your questions\u00a0\u201cSorry puppy, just thinking out loud.\u201d sighing you too walking over to a bench and moved the snow before sitting down.</p><p>The dog followed and hopped up beside you\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t have anywhere to go for Christmas either?\u201d you asked.</p><p>The dog tilted his head as if he was confused</p><p>\u201cMy parents are overseas right now seeing my sick grandmother in the states.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cThey were gonna take me too, but I told them it would be too much trouble and that Father needed to be with grandmother during her possibly last few days.\u201d<br></p><p>the dogs head dropped into your lap as he gave a almost sympathetic sounding whine.</p><p>You stroked his head\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me boy, i\u2019ll be okay, i\u2019m used to being alone anyway.\u201d</p><p>he didn\u2019t seem to like this answer and grabbed your bag before jumping off the bench\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Puppy give that back!\u201d you called as the dog began to run away and thus the chase began<br></p><p>However about ten minutes later you had lost the dog and felt like your chest was burning from all the cold air you had breathed in</p><p>\u201c(L/N)?\u201d a familiar voice spoke\u00a0<br></p><p>You looked up to see James and Sirius walking towards you, your bag in Sirius\u2019s hands</p><p>\u201cMy bag!\u201d you said upon seeing it and quickly took it when Sirius handed it over\u00a0\u201cThank you so much, a dog came and ran off with it.\u201d.<br></p><p>James chuckled\u00a0\u201cSeems like he was a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>You could have sworn you seen Sirius shoot James a death glare</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here? I thought you were going home for Christmas.\u201d you asked knowing Sirius lived with Potter\u2019s now.<br></p><p>\u201cWell we found your bag and wanted to return it before we left, but aren\u2019t you doing home too?\u201d Sirius asked<br></p><p>\u201cNo i\u2019m staying here, family stuff and all, but i\u2019ll be okay alone.\u201d you assured them.<br></p><p>James frowned\u00a0\u201cNobody should be alone on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>You gave a shrug\u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, don\u2019t have any family to go to this year.\u201d</p><p>Sirius and James looked to each other before they both spoke at the same time\u00a0\u201cCome with us than.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both insane..\u201d you looked at them in surprise\u00a0\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>Sirius shrugged\u00a0\u201cThan we get to know each other better over the holiday!\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry (L/N), my parents will love you.\u201d James added<br></p><p>Before you could protest the two were pulling you along with them and before you knew it your bag was packed and you were heading to the Potters residence\u00a0</p><p>You thumbed through a book you had brought to distract yourself, your leg anxiously bouncing despite your internal protest</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d Sirius asked from across the carriage where he sat.<br></p><p>\u201cThat obvious?\u201d you sighed as you sat your book down<br></p><p>You looked to see James was asleep against the wall, his glasses askew. Getting to your feet you walked over and took them off him before placing them on the windowsill.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really nice (L/N).\u201d Sirius said as he watched you take a blanket from your bag and put it on James.<br></p><p>\u201cHuman decency.\u201d you shrugged\u00a0\u201cMy parents raised me to treat others like how I wish to be treated, but to also know right from wrong to keep myself from getting hurt.\u201d.</p><p>You sat back down and opened your bag absentmindedly taking out your antidepressants to take one seeing a you had forgot that morning</p><p>\u201cYou take antidepressants?\u201d Sirius asked and you froze<br></p><p>\u201cY-Yeah..I have since this summer.\u201d you said going to put the medicine back.<br></p><p><b>\u201cTake your medicine.\u201d</b> he said handing you his pumpkin juice he had purchased.<br></p><p>You nodded and thanked him before doing as he told you</p><p>\u201cI take them too.\u201d he said as you handed back the drink.<br></p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked surprised.<br></p><p>He nodded\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the wizard alternative, but it\u2019s still the same thing.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cGuess were both battling our own demons.\u201d you laughed a bit.<br></p><p>\u201cNot alone though.\u201d he gave you a small smile\u00a0\u201cJames and his family have really helped me to learn i\u2019m not alone\u2026Maybe that\u2019s why i\u2019m so drawn to you.\u201d.<br></p><p>You tilted your head like the dog had earlier and Sirius couldn\u2019t help, but laugh, and your poor heart was ready to leap out of your chest at the beautiful sound.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just..The more i\u2019ve been around you the more i\u2019m seeing the real you, and I can tell you\u2019re unhappy.\u201d he sighed\u00a0\u201cIf I had it my way i\u2019d put an end to the dark lord\u2019s army and maybe then all this blood talk finally wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p><b>\u201cThey\u2019re monsters.\u201d</b> you added as you looked down to your lap\u00a0\u201cWho could obey such an evil man..?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy family.\u201d he stated, no emotion in his voice.<br></p><p>\u201cSirius I didn\u2019t-\u201d you began, but he cut you off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright (L/N), not like you asked about them, it was my choice to mention them.\u201d he looked to the window<br></p><p>You sighed\u00a0\u2018Way to go idiot, why do you even speak?\u2019 you thought picking your book back up</p><p>\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \n\n<br></p>",

triumphantly.<br></p><p>You choked on the bite you had just taken, was he haunting you or something?!</p><p>Grabbing your water you quickly downed some as you coughed trying to catch your

here?!<br></p><p>You felt yourself beginning to slip into a full blown anxiety attack as the room began to spin and your hands suddenly felt tingly despite how tightly you were holding onto your skirt.</p><p>Sirius however, seemed to immediately recognize this\u00a0\u201c(L/N) calm down, i\u2019m not upset.\u201d his voice barely making it you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re..you\u2019re not?\u201d

worried about you.<br></p><p>\u201cAnxiety?\u201d Fiona chimed in curiously\u00a0\u201cYou have anxiety (F/N)?\u201d.<br></p><p>Your heart dropped into your stomach, so much for hiding it, but at least they didn\u2019t know about your meds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really.\u201d you lied\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll send a owl home about it.\u201d another lie.<br></p><p>This seemed to please your friends, but Sirius still looked skeptical, yet before he could retaliate his friends were calling to him and left with a wave.</p><p>\u201cSince when are you chummy with Sirius?\u201d Jamie asked leaning towards you in anticipation.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not chummy with him.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cCan we just get to potions now before were stuck behind Balski, Avers, and Kenton again?\u201d.<br></p><p>They both gave a shrug before the the three of you made your war towards class.</p><p>Approaching the classroom the three of you spotted the unthinkable, the marauders were already there as well which was weird seeing as they were usually the last to arrive</p><p>\u201cThis is getting weird..\u201d you mumbled as you held your textbook closer to your chest<br></p><p>\u201cTwo times in a day.\u201d Jamie added<br></p><p>\u201cThree actually..\u201d you slumped against the cold wall as you raked a hand through your hair\u00a0<br></p><p>The four seemed to finally notice the three of you, you could feel Sirius\u2019s eyes on you which made you shift uneasily\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMudblood.\u201d someone called and out of instinct you turned to see who said it.<br></p><p>Avers had just entered the dungeon and didn\u2019t look too pleased</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth Avers.\u201d you heard Sirius growl.<br></p><p>The color drained from Avers face as he looked to see the marauders not standing too far away\u00a0\u201cOr what Black?\u201d his voice was shaky despite him trying to put on a tough guy act.</p><p>\u201cOh I could think of a few things.\u201d the marauder growled in response beginning to move towards the slytherin<br></p><p>You quickly moved between the two of them\u00a0\u201cSirius don\u2019t, that\u2019s what he wants.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cAwe the mudblood is trying to protect you how cu-\u201d you didn\u2019t know why, but before Avers could finish his sentence your hand had met his right cheek out of anger.<br></p><p>Sure you had felt anger towards him before, but you had been too scared to act on it</p><p>\u201cL-Leave him out of this!\u201d you managed as your hands balled into fists.<br></p><p>Behind you Sirius had a mixture of shock and pride on his face\u00a0</p><p>Avers went to grab your arm, but luckily or you Slughorn had just walked out of his classroom\u00a0\u201cWhat is going on out here?!\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201c(L/N) hit me!\u201d Avers tattled like he was back in primary school.<br></p><p>\u201cYou called her a mudblood!\u201d Jamie piped up<br></p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Peter echoed from beside Sirius.<br></p><p>\u201cIs this true Mr.Avers?\u201d Slughorn asked sounding disappointed\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to have to deduct ten points from slytherin for this.\u201d.<br></p><p>\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Avers growled clearly enraged\u00a0\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong here professor, she-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI suggest you hold your tongue young man before you become the sole purpose slytherin loses the house cup this year.\u201d your professor warned.<br></p><p>You watched as Avers stormed out of the dungeons mumbling threats under his breath as more students began to arrive.</p><p>Sighing you finally looked back to Sirius once you were inside the classroom\u00a0\u201cThanks for standing up for me back there..\u201d.</p><p>He laughed lightly\u00a0\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like you needed my help though.\u201d.</p><p>You shook your head\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have retaliated like that if he hadn\u2019t brought you into it. It\u2019s one thing for him to mess with me over something as silly as being muggle born, but it\u2019s another for him to attack innocent people who were just trying to help me.\u201d.</p><p>He frowned\u00a0\u201c(L/N) you know you don\u2019t deserve any of this right?\u201d.</p><p>You nodded despite the nagging voice in the back of your head\u00a0\u201cYeah..I sh-\u201d you wee stopped by Sirius\u2019s hand grabbing yours.</p><p><b>\u201cJust smile, I really need to see you smile right now.\u201d</b> he spoke softly, his gray eyes looking into your (E/C) ones.</p><p>You felt your face heat up from the direct contact and managed to give him a small shy smile\u00a0\u2018People are staring..\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you look beautiful when you smile.\u201d he smirked and kissed your hand before letting it go.<br></p><p>You quickly walked back to your desk feeling your face buning, Jamie and Fiona were on either side of you both quietly squealing as they leaned closer to you.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be the maid of honor at your wedding right?\u201d Fiona joked.<br></p><p>\u201cNo me!\u201d Jamie whined.<br></p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both horrible.\u201d you said sliding down in your chair hiding your face.<br></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2661 \u2661 \u2661 \n\n<br></p><p>Weeks had past since the incident and seeing as it was Christmas break, the school was the quietest it ever was which you found to be soothing as you let yourself wonder around the school grounds. You soon came across the whomping willow and admired it from a distance, the violent tree was beautiful, but deadly and preferred life over being pummeled into the ground.</p><p>Hearing a bark you looked around to see a big black dog bounding towards you, you threw your arms up to protect yourself, however when nothing came you slowly lowered them to see the dog simply sitting in front of you with it\u2019s long tongue hanging out of it\u2019s mouth as his mouth was open almost like he was smiling- or her- you weren\u2019t even gonna attempt to check.</p><p>\u201cHello there.\u201d you said slowly bringing you hand out for the dog to sniff.<br></p><p>He gave it a sniff before licking it which made you laugh\u00a0\u201cWell you\u2019re awfully friendly aren\u2019t you?\u201d scratching under his chin you looked around\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know dogs were allowed here..Are you a stray? Can strays even get on the school grounds?\u201d</p><p>The dog barked again ceasing your questions\u00a0\u201cSorry puppy, just thinking out loud.\u201d sighing you too walking over to a bench and moved the snow before sitting down.</p><p>The dog followed and hopped up beside you\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t have anywhere to go for Christmas either?\u201d you asked.</p><p>The dog tilted his head as if he was confused</p><p>\u201cMy parents are overseas right now seeing my sick grandmother in the states.\u201d you sighed\u00a0\u201cThey were gonna take me too, but I told them it would be too much trouble and that Father needed to be with grandmother during her possibly last few days.\u201d<br></p><p>the dogs head dropped into your lap as he gave a almost sympathetic sounding whine.</p><p>You stroked his head\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me boy, i\u2019ll be okay, i\u2019m used to being alone anyway.\u201d</p><p>he didn\u2019t seem to like this answer and grabbed your bag before jumping off the bench\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey! Puppy give that back!\u201d you called as the dog began to run away and thus the chase began<br></p><p>However about ten minutes later you had lost the dog and felt like your chest was burning from all the cold air you had breathed in</p><p>\u201c(L/N)?\u201d a familiar voice spoke\u00a0<br></p><p>You looked up to see James and Sirius walking towards you, your bag in Sirius\u2019s hands</p><p>\u201cMy bag!\u201d you said upon seeing it and quickly took it when Sirius handed it over\u00a0\u201cThank you so much, a dog came and ran off with it.\u201d.<br></p><p>James chuckled\u00a0\u201cSeems like he was a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>You could have sworn you seen Sirius shoot James a death glare</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here? I thought you were going home for Christmas.\u201d you asked knowing Sirius lived with Potter\u2019s now.<br></p><p>\u201cWell we found your bag and wanted to return it before we left, but aren\u2019t you doing home too?\u201d Sirius asked<br></p><p>\u201cNo i\u2019m staying here, family stuff and all, but i\u2019ll be okay alone.\u201d you assured them.<br></p><p>James frowned\u00a0\u201cNobody should be alone on Christmas.\u201d</p><p>You gave a shrug\u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, don\u2019t have any family to go to this year.\u201d</p><p>Sirius and James looked to each other before they both spoke at the same time\u00a0\u201cCome with us than.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both insane..\u201d you looked at them in surprise\u00a0\u201cYou barely know me.\u201d</p><p>Sirius shrugged\u00a0\u201cThan we get to know each other better over the holiday!\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry (L/N), my parents will love you.\u201d James added<br></p><p>Before you could protest the two were pulling you along with them and before you knew it your bag was packed and you were heading to the Potters residence\u00a0</p><p>You thumbed through a book you had brought to distract yourself, your leg anxiously bouncing despite your internal protest</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d Sirius asked from across the carriage where he sat.<br></p><p>\u201cThat obvious?\u201d you sighed as you sat your book down<br></p><p>You looked to see James was asleep against the wall, his glasses askew.

He was cool and mysterious meanwhile you were just boring old you.</p><p><b>&ldquo;How could I ever forget about you?&rdquo;</b> he asked laughing a bit&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the girl who spilled butterbeer all over herself on the last hogsmeade trip.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Of course that&rsquo;s how he remembered you, you wanted to crawl into a hole and never come out.</p><p>&ldquo;E-Excuse me.&rdquo; you quickly hurried past him as you heard a few people that had been nearby snickering.<br /></p><p>Sirius watched you go as confusion crossed his face, he had only meant it as an ice breaker of sorts, he hadn&rsquo;t meant to upset you.&rsquo;<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9825;\n\n\n\n&#9825;\n\n\n\n&#9825;\n\n<br /></p><p>Come lunch you could feel that your hunger growing thanks to not having ate anything that morning, sitting down at your houses table once again you took one of the sandwiches supplied and at it quietly as you kept an eye on the ceiling seeing as you weren&rsquo;t too interested in the conversation your friends were having across the table.</p><p>&ldquo;(Y/N) are you listening?&rdquo; your friend Fiona&rsquo;s voice suddenly reached you.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Oh yeah, totally.&rdquo; you tried to play it off like you had been listening.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;So you agree, Sirius is the cutest guy in our year.&rdquo; your other friend Jamie grinned triumphantly.<br /></p><p>You choked on the bite you had just taken, was he haunting you or something?!</p><p>Grabbing your water you quickly downed some as you coughed trying to catch your breath&nbsp;&ldquo;Why on earth are we talking about something like that?!&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Told you he wasn&rsquo;t listening.&rdquo; Jamie snickered&nbsp;&ldquo;And we are talking about it since we find them attractive.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You sighed as you finished your sandwich&nbsp;&ldquo;Attractive or not, everyone know James and Lily are gonna end up together, Remus is dating his studies, Peter is well, he&rsquo;s Peter, and Sirius is-&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m what?&rdquo; Sirius cut you off siting beside you.<br /></p><p>You nearly jumped out of your skin, meanwhile your two friends seemed to be trying to play it cool.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; He asked smirking in your direction<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; you could feel yourself shaking, why was he here?!<br /></p><p>You felt yourself beginning to slip into a full blown anxiety attack as the room began to spin and your hands suddenly felt tingly despite how tightly you were holding onto your skirt.</p><p>Sirius however, seemed to immediately recognize this&nbsp;&ldquo;(L/N) calm down, i&rsquo;m not upset.&rdquo; his voice barely making it you.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re..you&rsquo;re not?&rdquo; you managed as you closed your eyes to stop the room from spinning.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Of course, but (L/N) <b>you need to see a doctor </b>about your anxiety.&rdquo; he stated almost seeming as if he was worried about you.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Anxiety?&rdquo; Fiona chimed in curiously&nbsp;&ldquo;You have anxiety (F/N)?&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>Your heart dropped into your stomach, so much for hiding it, but at least they didn&rsquo;t know about your meds.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really.&rdquo; you lied&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a owl home about it.&rdquo; another lie.<br /></p><p>This seemed to please your friends, but Sirius still looked skeptical, yet before he could retaliate his friends were calling to him and left with a wave.</p><p>&ldquo;Since when are you chummy with Sirius?&rdquo; Jamie asked leaning towards you in anticipation.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not chummy with him.&rdquo; you sighed&nbsp;&ldquo;Can we just get to potions now before were stuck behind Balski, Avers, and Kenton again?&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>They both gave a shrug before the the three of you made your war towards class.</p><p>Approaching the classroom the three of you spotted the unthinkable, the marauders were already there as well which was weird seeing as they were usually the last to arrive</p><p>&ldquo;This is getting weird..&rdquo; you mumbled as you held your textbook closer to your chest<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Two times in a day.&rdquo; Jamie added<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Three actually..&rdquo; you slumped against the cold wall as you raked a hand through your hair&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The four seemed to finally notice the three of you, you could feel Sirius&rsquo;s eyes on you which made you shift uneasily&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mudblood.&rdquo; someone called and out of instinct you turned to see who said it.<br /></p><p>Avers had just entered the dungeon and didn&rsquo;t look too pleased</p><p>&ldquo;Watch your mouth Avers.&rdquo; you heard Sirius growl.<br /></p><p>The color drained from Avers face as he looked to see the marauders not standing too far away&nbsp;&ldquo;Or what Black?&rdquo; his voice was shaky despite him trying to put on a tough guy act.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I could think of a few things.&rdquo; the marauder growled in response beginning to move towards the slytherin<br /></p><p>You quickly moved between the two of them&nbsp;&ldquo;Sirius don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s what he wants.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Awe the mudblood is trying to protect you how cu-&rdquo; you didn&rsquo;t know why, but before Avers could finish his sentence your hand had met his right cheek out of anger.<br /></p><p>Sure you had felt anger towards him before, but you had been too scared to act on it</p><p>&ldquo;L-Leave him out of this!&rdquo; you managed as your hands balled into fists.<br /></p><p>Behind you Sirius had a mixture of shock and pride on his face&nbsp;</p><p>Avers went to grab your arm, but luckily or you Slughorn had just walked out of his classroom&nbsp;&ldquo;What is going on out here?!&rdquo; he questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;(L/N) hit me!&rdquo; Avers tattled like he was back in primary school.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You called her a mudblood!&rdquo; Jamie piped up<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Peter echoed from beside Sirius.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is this true Mr.Avers?&rdquo; Slughorn asked sounding disappointed&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to deduct ten points from slytherin for this.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;WHAT!?&rdquo; Avers growled clearly enraged&nbsp;&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t belong here professor, she-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I suggest you hold your tongue young man before you become the sole purpose slytherin loses the house cup this year.&rdquo; your professor warned.<br /></p><p>You watched as Avers stormed out of the dungeons mumbling threats under his breath as more students began to arrive.</p><p>Sighing you finally looked back to Sirius once you were inside the classroom&nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks for standing up for me back there..&rdquo;.</p><p>He laughed lightly&nbsp;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem like you needed my help though.&rdquo;.</p><p>You shook your head&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would have retaliated like that if he hadn&rsquo;t brought you into it. It&rsquo;s one thing for him to mess with me over something as silly as being muggle born, but it&rsquo;s another for him to attack innocent people who were just trying to help me.&rdquo;.</p><p>He frowned&nbsp;&ldquo;(L/N) you know you don&rsquo;t deserve any of this right?&rdquo;.</p><p>You nodded despite the nagging voice in the back of your head&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah..I sh-&rdquo; you wee stopped by Sirius&rsquo;s hand grabbing yours.</p><p><b>&ldquo;Just smile, I really need to see you smile right now.&rdquo;</b> he spoke softly, his gray eyes looking into your (E/C) ones.</p><p>You felt your face heat up from the direct contact and managed to give him a small shy smile&nbsp;&lsquo;People are staring..&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you look beautiful when you smile.&rdquo; he smirked and kissed your hand before letting it go.<br /></p><p>You quickly walked back to your desk feeling your face buning, Jamie and Fiona were on either side of you both quietly squealing as they leaned closer to you.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be the maid of honor at your wedding right?&rdquo; Fiona joked.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No me!&rdquo; Jamie whined.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both horrible.&rdquo; you said sliding down in your chair hiding your face.<br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#9825; &#9825; &#9825; \n\n<br /></p><p>Weeks had past since the incident and seeing as it was Christmas break, the school was the quietest it ever was which you found to be soothing as you let yourself wonder around the school grounds. You soon came across the whomping willow and admired it from a distance, the violent tree was beautiful, but deadly and preferred life over being pummeled into the ground.</p><p>Hearing a bark you looked around to see a big black dog bounding towards you, you threw your arms up to protect yourself, however when nothing came you slowly lowered them to see the dog simply sitting in front of you with it&rsquo;s long tongue hanging out of it&rsquo;s mouth as his mouth was open almost like he was smiling- or her- you weren&rsquo;t even gonna attempt to check.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello there.&rdquo; you said slowly bringing you hand out for the dog to sniff.<br /></p><p>He gave it a sniff before licking it which made you laugh&nbsp;&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re awfully friendly aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; scratching under his chin you looked around&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know dogs were allowed here..Are you a stray? Can strays even get on the school grounds?&rdquo;</p><p>The dog barked again ceasing your questions&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry puppy, just thinking out loud.&rdquo; sighing you too walking over to a bench and moved the snow before sitting down.</p><p>The dog followed and hopped up beside you&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go for Christmas either?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>The dog tilted his head as if he was confused</p><p>&ldquo;My parents are overseas right now seeing my sick grandmother in the states.&rdquo; you sighed&nbsp;&ldquo;They were gonna take me too, but I told them it would be too much trouble and that Father needed to be with grandmother during her possibly last few days.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>the dogs head dropped into your lap as he gave a almost sympathetic sounding whine.</p><p>You stroked his head&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me boy, i&rsquo;ll be okay, i&rsquo;m used to being alone anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>he didn&rsquo;t seem to like this answer and grabbed your bag before jumping off the bench&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! Puppy give that back!&rdquo; you called as the dog began to run away and thus the chase began<br /></p><p>However about ten minutes later you had lost the dog and felt like your chest was burning from all the cold air you had breathed in</p><p>&ldquo;(L/N)?&rdquo; a familiar voice spoke&nbsp;<br /></p><p>You looked up to see James and Sirius walking towards you, your bag in Sirius&rsquo;s hands</p><p>&ldquo;My bag!&rdquo; you said upon seeing it and quickly took it when Sirius handed it over&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you so much, a dog came and ran off with it.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>James chuckled&nbsp;&ldquo;Seems like he was a bad boy.&rdquo;</p><p>You could have sworn you seen Sirius shoot James a death glare</p><p>&ldquo;What are you guys doing here? I thought you were going home for Christmas.&rdquo; you asked knowing Sirius lived with Potter&rsquo;s now.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Well we found your bag and wanted to return it before we left, but aren&rsquo;t you doing home too?&rdquo; Sirius asked<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No i&rsquo;m staying here, family stuff and all, but i&rsquo;ll be okay alone.&rdquo; you assured them.<br /></p><p>James frowned&nbsp;&ldquo;Nobody should be alone on Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>You gave a shrug&nbsp;&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, don&rsquo;t have any family to go to this year.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius and James looked to each other before they both spoke at the same time&nbsp;&ldquo;Come with us than.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both insane..&rdquo; you looked at them in surprise&nbsp;&ldquo;You barely know me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sirius shrugged&nbsp;&ldquo;Than we get to know each other better over the holiday!&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t worry (L/N), my parents will love you.&rdquo; James added<br /></p><p>Before you could protest the two were pulling you along with them and before you knew it your bag was packed and you were heading to the Potters residence&nbsp;</p><p>You thumbed through a book you had brought to distract yourself, your leg anxiously bouncing despite your internal protest</p><p>&ldquo;Nervous?&rdquo; Sirius asked from across the carriage where he sat.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;That obvious?&rdquo; you sighed as you sat your book down<br /></p><p>You looked to see James was asleep against the wall, his glasses askew. Getting to your feet you walked over and took them off him before placing them on the windowsill.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really nice (L/N).&rdquo; Sirius said as he watched you take a blanket from your bag and put it on James.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Human decency.&rdquo; you shrugged&nbsp;&ldquo;My parents raised me to treat others like how I wish to be treated, but to also know right from wrong to keep myself from getting hurt.&rdquo;.</p><p>You sat back down and opened your bag absentmindedly taking out your antidepressants to take one seeing a you had forgot that morning</p><p>&ldquo;You take antidepressants?&rdquo; Sirius asked and you froze<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Y-Yeah..I have since this summer.&rdquo; you said going to put the medicine back.<br /></p><p><b>&ldquo;Take your medicine.&rdquo;</b> he said handing you his pumpkin juice he had purchased.<br /></p><p>You nodded and thanked him before doing as he told you</p><p>&ldquo;I take them too.&rdquo; he said as you handed back the drink.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; you asked surprised.<br /></p><p>He nodded&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wizard alternative, but it&rsquo;s still the same thing.&rdquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess were both battling our own demons.&rdquo; you laughed a bit.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Not alone though.&rdquo; he gave you a small smile&nbsp;&ldquo;James and his family have really helped me to learn i&rsquo;m not alone&hellip;Maybe that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;m so drawn to you.&rdquo;.<br /></p><p>You tilted your head like the dog had earlier and Sirius couldn&rsquo;t help, but laugh, and your poor heart was ready to leap out of your chest at the beautiful sound.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just..The more i&rsquo;ve been around you the more i&rsquo;m seeing the real you, and I can tell you&rsquo;re unhappy.&rdquo; he sighed&nbsp;&ldquo;If I had it my way i&rsquo;d put an end to the dark lord&rsquo;s army and maybe then all this blood talk finally wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p><p><b>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re monsters.&rdquo;</b> you added as you looked down to your lap&nbsp;&ldquo;Who could obey such an evil man..?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My family.&rdquo; he stated, no emotion in his voice.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Sirius I didn&rsquo;t-&rdquo; you began, but he cut you off.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright (L/N), not like you asked about them, it was my choice to mention them.&rdquo; he looked to the window<br /></p><p>You sighed&nbsp;&lsquo;Way to go idiot, why do you even speak?&rsquo; you thought picking your book back up</p><p>\n\n &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#9825; &#9825; &#9825; \n\n<br /></p>",

There\nwere a hundred questions he wanted to ask but how could he when the other boy\nseemed so sad and exhausted. Malfoy hadn\u2019t let go of him as he was put to bed, twisting\nand moaning when he had tried to get out of his grip. The nightmares weren\u2019t\nfar away, they all knew it.

it\u2019s kinda long oops</p><!-- more --><ul><li>James grew up in a very affectionate home, with two parents who loved him a whole lot<br/></li><li>Because of this, he was very unafraid of showing others how much he loved them</li><li>And he never really thought about the fact that other people didn\u2019t have such great parents</li><li>Because his always put him first and made sure he got the best they could provide him</li><li>He wasn\u2019t spoiled <strike>maybe a little</strike> but he had a comfortable and nourishing childhood</li></ul><ul><li>Sirius grew up in the Most Ancient House of Black, which, newsflash, was not very loving</li><li>He was reprimanded most of his childhood for not fitting the\u00a0\u201cmold\u201d boys his age in his class should have</li><li>While other boys his age were learning how to have manners at dinner parties and planning what they would do in the future, he was reading muggle romance novels he stole and teaching himself how to juggle in case it ever comes up in a conversation</li><li>All his friends were forced friendships to build relationships and connections with other high-class families</li><li>So he wasn\u2019t very familiar with the idea that friends or even parents could care very much about you</li><li>Because families to him were just units that helped you survive until you were old enough to live on your own</li></ul><ul><li>Remus grew up with relatively loving parents</li><li>But the whole\u00a0\u201cwerewolf\u201d thing was pretty difficult for them</li><li>So a lot of his childhood was spent them worrying over him and worrying about other people seeing him</li><li>He had very few friends because his parents were afraid of him telling people about his condition or them finding out somehow</li><li>So to them, it was just better for him to be taught at home and not to play with other kids</li><li>He was shown love by his parents, but he eventually just believed he didn\u2019t deserve it because his parents seemed to act like he was a danger to everyone</li></ul><ul><li>\u00a0When James and Sirius met, Sirius was suspicious about why this boy with a full-face grin wanted to
