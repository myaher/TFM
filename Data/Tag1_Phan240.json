The barren path he trudges down is frosted with a sheet of white, thinner than a sleeve of cr\u00eape paper. The route home from Phil\u2019s winds around the town\u2019s park - a generous term for the patch of grass near a Primary school, vaguely upkept by an elderly man in a jumpsuit occasionally seen pulling weeds. The cold, endless winter has left the park dry and brown, a perfect reflection of Dan\u2019s mood. There\u2019s a dilapidated children\u2019s playground at one end of the park, surrounded by a chain link fence. Inside, the metal swings and climbing frames are rusted to the point of danger. It\u2019s doubtful that any sound-minded parents allow their kids to brave them anymore.\u00a0</p><p>As he walks by the skate park at the other end, Dan slows a little, surveying what\u2019s become of it. When he was around seven or eight, Dan would sneak out here to watch Ricky skate with his friends. He\u2019d loiter at the edge of the concrete, pretending to be just passing by. Ricky would yell at him to go home, tell him he was too young to be there and to stop pestering him. Dan recalls the sneer on his brother\u2019s face so clearly, even now. At twelve years old, Ricky was just as mean, just as angry as he is today. It didn\u2019t deter Dan, back then. As a child, all Dan wanted was to be his older brother, to emulate him, or at least to befriend him. </p><!-- more --><p>A thick pulse of sudden wind sweeps over Dan, and he shivers. Without a jacket, the early morning is almost unbearably cold. He shoves his hands as deeply as he can into his shallow jean pockets, and walks on.\u00a0</p><p>Rather than dwell on what awaits him at home, Dan imagines he is back in Phil\u2019s bed, weighted by his soft blue-green duvet, Phil\u2019s silky hair tickling his cheek. Phil gets too close in the night. He doesn\u2019t mean to, but he\u2019s drawn to warmth unconsciously, like a cat sprawling in a sunbeam. Dan had woken up early to the press of his body, to the sighs of his sleep, long fingers resting on his abdomen. He couldn\u2019t stand the touch of him, in the light of day. He\u2019d stolen out of Phil\u2019s bedroom before even Mrs Lester was roused. He wishes he had somewhere else to return to, but having been kicked out of Ozone, and having pissed off Sam and Ben, Dan is officially out of options. He knew he\u2019d have to face Ricky eventually, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less horrific of a reality.</p><p>The walk between his and Phil\u2019s house is maybe ten minutes at the most, but despite his pathetic attempt to dawdle and drag it out, the cold spurs him onwards, and he arrives far too soon. The light is on in Ricky\u2019s bedroom window; he\u2019ll likely be getting ready for work. Dan glances at Ricky\u2019s car, parked in the driveway still, silent, unknowingly the root of all this trouble. Dan takes a deep breath, then lets himself in the front door.</p><p>It takes under a minute for Ricky to appear at the top of the stairs, having heard the door open no doubt. His shirt is half buttoned, and his knee high black socks are the only clothing on his bare shins. At least he\u2019s wearing boxers.</p><p>\u201cYou little shit,\u201d Ricky hisses, then thunders down the stairs. Dan swallows hard, trying to remain composed as he approaches. \u201cThink you can just steal my fucking car? Think I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><p>His hands are already balled into fists.</p><p>\u201cBrought it back, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Ricky grabs him by the shirt and shoves him hard against the door, growling. Dan squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable blow. It doesn\u2019t come straight away. Seconds pass, and still no impact, so Dan opens one eye, meeting Ricky\u2019s glare.</p><p>His brother is breathing hard, chest puffing out. His fist has fallen to his side, though he still has ahold of Dan by the shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re all\u2026\u201d Ricky says, then gestures to Dan\u2019s cheek, making him flinch. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your face?\u201d</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t answer. Whatever he says would make no difference anyway. He wishes Ricky would just get it over with, land his kicks or punches so they can move on. Once he gets his anger out, Ricky\u2019s at least a little easier to deal with. To Dan\u2019s astonishment, Ricky releases him instead. He takes a step back, surveying Dan carefully. </p><p>\u201cSomeone do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t dare reply, but his left shoulder comes up in a small shrug.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck\u2019s it matter, Ricky?\u201d Dan croaks out. \u201cYou pissed off someone got there first?\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s teeth clench. \u201cMum said some kid came round looking for you. Lanky, black hair. Glasses. Was it him?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to swallow the burst of hysterical laughter that surges up. The idea of Phil managing to injure anything larger than the moths he occasionally has to swat for Dan is bonkers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, choosing not to bother trying to explain this.</p><p>\u201cIf it was, I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Ricky says, absurdly. </p><p>Dan can\u2019t understand his brother\u2019s logic \u2013 it\u2019s apparently fine if Dan\u2019s injuries are caused by Ricky himself, but if it\u2019s anyone outside the family, that\u2019s obviously outrageous. But Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to probe Ricky for whatever half-witted explanation he might give, because at that moment, there\u2019s a knock on the other side of the door. Dan feels the three pounds vibrate down his back.</p><p>Ricky stares, deep lines creasing his Neanderthal forehead as he thinks about what to do. He grabs Dan\u2019s arm and yanks him away from the door, then wrenches it open. Dan wonders if he\u2019s forgotten he\u2019s not dressed. At the sight of Phil, standing ashen on his front step, Dan\u2019s blood runs cold. He stumbles forwards, attempting to push Ricky aside, but his brother is stocky, heavy-set. Dan\u2019s always been the twiglet, compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ricky says, drinking in the sight of Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re the nonce who was here the other day. Mum says you had a hand in stealing my car, an\u2019 all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan jumps in quickly. He has a hand hovering over Ricky\u2019s upper arm, primed to hold him back if he tries anything. \u201cNo, that was all me. He\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, his shoulders already slumping in relief at the sight of him. \u201cI woke up and you were gone. Are you alright-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d Ricky says to Phil. He takes a step over the threshold, getting closer to him. \u201cWere you involved in this? Did you see him nick it?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks from Ricky to Dan, at a loss. \u201cI-\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand makes contact with Ricky\u2019s shoulder and pulls hard, forcing him to turn. \u201cRicky, it was me. All me. I stole your keys off the counter, I snuck out while you were in your room, I drove the car to Prom.\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s eyes are fiery and dark. He opens his mouth to retort, to yell perhaps, but then Phil speaks.</p><p>\u201cBut I made him,\u201d he says. Dan could throttle him. \u201cI asked him to take it for the night. I bribed him, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, shut up,\u201d Dan hisses.</p><p>Phil ignores him. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. If you wanna be pissed at anyone it should be me. Dan\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>This last comment is just strange enough to kill Dan\u2019s argument before it forms. Ricky is silent in the face of Phil\u2019s words. He\u2019s squinting at Phil, like he\u2019s trying to figure him out. Phil is dressed bizarrely, in black jogging bottoms, a Halloween jumper, and a galaxy printed jacket. He\u2019s obviously rolled straight out of bed. Even his shoelaces are untied. Did he honestly wake up, realise Dan was gone and run right after him?</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Ricky suddenly declares. </p><p>He turns from Phil, shoving past Dan back into the house. Dan holds his breath, staying perfectly still as he listens to Ricky\u2019s feet pounding up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did we get away with it?\u201d Phil asks into the silence Ricky left them standing in.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to get away with,\u201d Dan replies, tetchy. \u201cThat was really fucking stupid, trying to take the blame like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil just shrugs. It\u2019s infuriating, how lightly he\u2019s taking this. Dan\u2019s heart has only just ceased pounding. \u201cI was so worried when I woke up this morning and you were gone,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI knew you had nowhere else to go but here, back to Ricky. I thought if I came and backed you up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan\u2019s through keeping a lid on the anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking school! My brother isn\u2019t Hardy Jenns or Sam the sound tech. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He lifts up his shirt, exposing his left side, where a patch of raw, shiny pink skin is visible. \u201cYou know what this is? It\u2019s from when I was nine, and I broke Ricky\u2019s CD Walkman by accident, so he picked up Dad\u2019s boiling hot coffee and threw it at me.\u201d Dan lets the shirt fall, then yanks his collar to one side, exposing his big floral tattoo. \u201cI got this done to cover up the scar from Ricky shoving me through a glass door when I was thirteen, right after Dad died, because I chickened out of speaking at the funeral.\u201d Dan sticks out his wrist, exposing more scars, more reminders. \u201cThese are from fights, from him pushing me over, or into doors or walls, and just from being smacked about all my damn life.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a breath, not able to meet Phil\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI have more,\u201d Dan says, voice cracking. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking violent, Phil. You can\u2019t piss him off. I can\u2019t see you be hurt like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil moves closer, so Dan takes a step back. They\u2019re both inside now, which is terrifying in itself for Dan, because Ricky is still upstairs. Dan had done so well keeping Phil from his family until now. He never wanted them to know of his existence, never wanted Phil to so much as be a blip on Ricky\u2019s radar. Dan vaguely notices he\u2019s crying, just from pure overwhelm, but he still doesn\u2019t expect it when Phil\u2019s arms wrap around him. It takes a minute, but eventually he just cant be bothered to resist. Phil is a warm, calm safety blanket. He smells like cinnamon and sweets, and he\u2019s offering himself to Dan, now, when he needs that blanket most, so Dan just melts into it. Phil doesn\u2019t say a word, he just holds tight, letting Dan sniffle and dampen his jacket.</p><p>Eventually Dan pulls free, wiping his sodden face with his sleeve. \u201cYou need to go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on,\u201d Phil replies quickly. He reaches for Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can come home with me again, just grab your stuff and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, stressing the word. He meets Phil\u2019s gaze somehow, though he knows he must look far from ferocious, with his piggy eyes and damp cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t be around you. We need to just\u2026\u201d Dan threads shaky fingers through his hair. He needs a shower, badly. \u201cWe need to spend some time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounds alarmed. \u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d Dan says, shutting him up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m driving you crazy. Things are\u2026 different. You have a girlfriend, and I just don\u2019t fit into that. Let\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d Phil says, frantic. He\u2019s trying to reach for Dan\u2019s hand, but Dan won\u2019t let him take hold. \u201cDan, we can get past this-\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cI have to get to work,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve skipped two shifts already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come in later.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes, begging. \u201cPlease, Phil,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Phil reaches the top of the hill, he\u2019s out of breath. He ran some of the way, and when he couldn\u2019t keep it up, slowed to a sort-of half jog. He spotted Amanda sat on the bench from the bottom of the hill, her thick curls buffeting about in the strong wind. She\u2019s facing away from him, so thankfully doesn\u2019t notice him puffing as he climbs the steep incline towards her.</p><p>At last he reaches her, and immediately begins apologising \u2013 he\u2019s almost an hour late to meet her here. She regards him a little worriedly, her big doe eyes round as she takes him in. She\u2019s wearing gold eyeshadow, making the chocolate-brown of her irises seem even richer.</p><p>\u201c\u2026so so sorry, I just got caught up, and then we sort of got in a fight, and-\u201d</p><p>Amanda holds up her hand to quiet him, alarmed. \u201cFight? Who did you fight with?\u201d</p><p>Phil flops down beside Amanda on the bench, unable to fight for breath standing upright any longer. \u201cDan,\u201d he says. \u201cI was at Dan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Amanda says. She lowers her hand, studying her pink fingernails. \u201cI thought you went home last night.\u201d</p><p>Yesterday evening, Phil had been at Amanda\u2019s house, helping her transport the enormous painting he\u2019d done of her into her bedroom. Her mum wasn\u2019t there, but her younger brothers, Jake and Aidan, had been. At nine and eleven, they were gleeful at having something to tease their sister about:</p><p><i>\u201cIs this your new boyfriend?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid he paint this picture of you?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it cos he lurrves you?\u201d</i></p><p>Phil had endured it with a smile, but their constant presence had not left a great deal of opportunity for him and Amanda to be alone.</p><p><i>\u201cWho looks after them when you and your mum aren\u2019t here?\u201d</i> Phil had asked, furtively, whilst Amanda was cooking the boys\u2019 dinner.</p><p><i>\u201cNobody,\u201d</i> Amanda replied. <i>\u201cSo I\u2019m pretty much always here.\u201d</i></p><p>Distracted as she was by her siblings, Phil spent a lot of the evening sat on Amanda\u2019s sofa, halfway through a Mario Kart race that Jake and Aidan had been too excitable to finish, his mind wandering to things he\u2019d been trying not to think about. Dan. Prom. The fight.</p><p>So, just as the boys were getting into their pyjamas, Phil decided he\u2019d head home. Amanda had her hands full, and despite trying to help her, Phil clearly was only getting in the way. She apologised about it, said they could meet up the next morning at the viewpoint up the hill by the park. Phil kissed her goodbye - on the cheek, her brothers were watching \u2013 and started to walk home. Then, he caught sight of the bus into town idling at the stop. Until that moment, he\u2019d been lying to himself that Dan would be more sensible than hanging out at Ozone for the past three days instead of coming into work or school. But seeing the bus just sat there, as if waiting for him to climb on, Phil couldn\u2019t keep up the pretence. He\u2019d jumped on straight away, barged into the club and found Dan off his face, snogging some creepy sound guy. He\u2019d managed to drag him home to stay over, after a lot of persuading and an almost-fight.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil replies, stretching the truth just a tad. \u201cDan&hellip; came over. After I left yours. This morning I\u2026 went round his for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Amanda nods in a way that screams \u2018bullshit\u2019. \u201cI thought he was pissed at you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s an angry guy.\u201d He settles back into the bench, eyes glazing as he recalls some of this anger. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen his face though, Jesus. Half black and blue from the fight. I still think Hardy got off worse, but I bet Dan\u2019s gonna be wearing that shiner for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Amanda says. \u201cSounds awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he stayed at yours last night?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to her. He feels a quick rush of guilt, but it recedes soon after. \u201cYeah. He was\u2026 upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea why?\u201d</p><p>Phil gnaws his lip. \u201cBecause of the fight, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s following sigh is deep, as if she\u2019s summoned it from a well of despair. \u201cPhil, we need to have a chat.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is just the same as his mum\u2019s was, when she explained that she couldn\u2019t afford to send Phil to art lessons anymore, and that he\u2019d just have to watch online videos, or read books at the library, and teach himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Phil asks, though his heart pounds.</p><p>Amanda sighs again, looking out at the view in front of her. From this spot, high on a hill, at the fringe of an ugly, usually empty car park, the whole of the town is visible. From such a high vantage point, it\u2019s worryingly easy to see the stark difference between the upper side and the lower, sliced as they are by the railway down the middle. On the lower side, Phil\u2019s side, the houses are crushed together, mostly semi-detached, with a few grey blocks of estate flats placed here and there. I\u2019s all residential, pretty much, apart from the odd off-licence lurking ominously on a street corner, it\u2019s neon \u201924-hour\u2019 sign buzzing faintly.</p><p>The other side is quite literally greener, as the gardens of the wealthier people\u2019s houses sprawl, covered in pretty flowers and big ponds. The houses are way up on the furthest reaches of the town, as far from the ugly side as they can get, and the middle is full of neat, modern offices, streets of clothes shops and caf\u00e9s, and of course the big fountain in the midst of it all, right by where Ozone is hidden, half-underground. As Amanda observes all of this, Phil wonders what she must think of it. She detests it, probably. Or maybe just longs to hop across that train track for good.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like me, Phil?\u201d</p><p>He turns to her, dumbfounded. For most, even just to glimpse her from afar would be enough of an answer to that question. \u201cUh\u2026 lots of reasons.\u201d</p><p>She turns to him. She looks worn out, her pretty features drooping. \u201cNo, honestly. I want you to tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Baffled, Phil\u2019s mind begins to reel, collecting all the reasons. He can\u2019t imagine Amanda is asking because of a hidden insecurity \u2013 she must be well aware of how much she is wanted by every female-liking person that catches a whiff of her knock-off perfume.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re funny,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou\u2019re really quite sharp, and sarcastic \u2013 it surprised me at first.\u201d</p><p>She nods, still with that worn-out look masking her face. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd um, you\u2019re gorgeous obviously,\u201d Phil says, blushing. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it. Your hair, and your eyes. And the way you smile - glowing. It\u2019s like you\u2019re three steps ahead of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like a dick,\u201d Amanda says, but she\u2019s smiling now, sort of. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find you just\u2026 super interesting,\u201d Phil confesses. He looks at his hands. \u201cThe life you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. You wanted this impossible thing - to be with the Elite despite your background. And you didn\u2019t let anything stop you. You fought for it.\u201d Phil is quiet for a moment, pensive. The wind sweeps one of Amanda\u2019s curls across his cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t even really get on with the Elite people. But being one of them\u2026 it\u2019s how you cope. It\u2019s like by hiding out with them, pretending to be something you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re escaping everything else.\u201d He glances at her worriedly. \u201cI might be getting this all wrong, feel free to sock me if I\u2019m being a twat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amanda says, shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s bang on, actually. I can\u2019t face my real life for too long, so I go hang out with a bunch of brain-dead morons, tag along to the parties they go to, pretend I\u2019m not\u2026 me.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods. \u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating. I admire your courage to do that every day. It must be so hard to keep it up.\u201d</p><p>Amanda is staring at him again. She looks as if she\u2019s waiting for something to click in Phil\u2019s mind. Phil just cocks his head to one side, totally in the dark. One last time, she heaves a sigh, then brings her hands up to untwist the earring from her left ear. Immediately, Phil is alarmed, and can only sit, wide-eyed, as she untwists the other, too. She holds them out to him in her tiny, pale hand. They look big, dark in her palm. Two blackcurrants in a pool of milk.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Phil,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course I do-\u201d</p><p>She places her other hand, the one not cupping the earrings, on his shoulder. As she leans in, her expression is kind, if a little condescending. \u201cNo. I want you to try and get this for yourself, Phil. I think you need to be the one to realise it, or you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Phil can feel the panic welling up. It\u2019s as if he can feel her slipping through his fingers. Surely there must be some way to hold on to her. He\u2019s already won her once, he can do it again. \u201cI asked you to Prom because I like you, because I want to be with you, because you deserve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I deserve better,\u201d Amanda finishes. \u201cBecause seedy guys are treating me like a piece of ass. Because I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m more than where I come from. Because you want to draw me, to show me that I\u2019m beautiful. To give me fancy things, so I can feel I\u2019m worth them. You want to hold me and kiss me and tell me that I\u2019m precious, and that I\u2019m safe, and that I\u2019m the most important thing to you, even if I don\u2019t matter to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes are watery. He\u2019s so scared of what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s sliced that brown-eyed gaze straight through his forehead, into his soft, mushy mind. </p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Amanda smiles. It\u2019s a gorgeous, radiant smile. She looks down into her hand, where the two black pearls lay, still. \u201cThese aren\u2019t meant for me, Phil. They belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>It takes Phil a moment, and then the penny drops. It drops like a stone into his gut, sending bubbles of hysterical laughter up his gullet, out of his throat. \u201cAre you talking about Dan?\u201d He asks, voice high. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not- I\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>Amanda reaches out, and Phil doesn\u2019t understand why until he feels her sweep away a tear from his cheek. \u201cIt was Dan that you took to Prom, Phil.\u201d Something about her tone is so sure, so unwaveringly honest, that Phil doesn\u2019t try to contradict her. \u201cIt was him you bought the earrings for. It\u2019s him you\u2019re worried about, him you\u2019d fight off a thousand dickheads for. It\u2019s him you want, that you think deserves the world, that you think should be with you. It\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d <i>understand</i>, Phil wants to say. He presses a hand to his forehead, his cheek. He feels warm, despite the wintry chill. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I think?\u201d Amanda asks. She takes hold of his hand, bringing it away from his face, clasping it. \u201cI think you have a huge well of kindness inside of you. I think you\u2019ve stored it up over years. You were waiting for the right person to give it to. And then you met that person, but he was stubborn, and he was defensive, and he wouldn\u2019t accept it. That\u2019s how he is. Fences built up sky high, all around him. So your well, it just kept building up. So much you were bursting with all this untapped, raw love and affection, all of it for him.\u201d </p><p>Amanda pauses. Phil feels his lungs growing tighter, as if he\u2019s climbing the hill again, stuck ascending it forever. He waits, struggling for air, for what she\u2019ll say next.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you saw me,\u201d Amanda says with a soft smile. \u201cAnd I am Dan. In so many ways. We grew up the same. We have the same attitude. We bury our shame in men that abuse us. We even look similar. Our hair. Our eyes. So you convinced yourself that it was me you wanted. That out of nowhere, I was the one for you. You didn\u2019t let yourself think it was Dan, not ever, because of those fences he has, keeping you away.\u201d She squeezes his hand. \u201cDo you think I might be right?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mind is reeling. It\u2019s a ferris wheel, going too fast, and rocking violently in a thunderstorm. The bolts and screws that keep it together are threatening to burst from their grooves. It\u2019s all about to come crashing down. Everything he\u2019s been so sure of, all that\u2019s been driving him for months. He looks at Amanda, tortured. Her smile is still in place. A film star smile, truly. As beautiful as looking straight at a burning, bright star. </p><p>But even though it is dazzling to behold her, windswept and as totally beguiling as she has ever been, deep in his soul, Phil knows. He\u2019s seen a better smile, one that cuts a dimple into a rounded cheek. He\u2019s seen browner eyes, that leak gold and caramel and ochre. He\u2019s felt softer curls against his fingers. He\u2019s heard a rarer, sweeter laugh, and a deeper, richer voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so sorry,\u201d Phil says. It\u2019s utterly gut-wrenching, to know, in his aching, guilty soul, that she is right. \u201cI\u2019ve strung you along all this time&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to, Phil,\u201d Amanda says softly. She presses the earrings into his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I doubt you even know how much you\u2019ve helped me, despite this. You reminded me that people like you exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like me,\u201d Phil scoffs. He shakes his head, eyes stinging. \u201cIdiots that blunder into things they\u2019ve half thought about. People that hurt everyone around them because they\u2019re too pig-headed to see two feet in front of their nose.\u201d</p><p>Amanda squeezes his hand. \u201cPeople that can fall so deeply, excruciatingly in love with someone that they\u2019re blind from it. If the past few days have been any glimpse of how generous, and sweet, and kind you\u2019d be with the person you love\u2026\u201d She shakes her head, eyebrows raised. \u201cDan\u2019s a heck of a lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can be okay with this,\u201d Phil sniffs, trying to ignore the heavy blush fizzing in his cheeks. \u201cWhen you said yes to Prom with me you lost everything. All the work you put in, getting in with the Elites\u2026 it\u2019s all for nothing. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you did me a favour, getting me out of that nightmare.\u201d Amanda smiles, that mischievous glimmer in her gold shadowed eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for me to stand on my own two feet for a while. Don\u2019t worry about me, okay? You\u2019ve got enough to deal with.\u201d She squeezes his hand a final time, and lets go. \u201cI\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s on the doghouse shift, because Louise is pissed at him for skipping work the past few days. She\u2019d had to cover for him when Hardy\u2019s dad came in, apparently, lying that he was ill with flu. The only reason Dan isn\u2019t fired, according to Louise, is because in all the years Dan\u2019s worked here, and all the extra shifts he\u2019s taken on, he\u2019s never before missed work.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you mop the floor tonight too,\u201d Louise shouts to Dan from the kitchen.</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes in secret. \u201cYeah, I will.\u201d</p><p>Privately, Dan suspects that Louise is a little extra pissed off because he refused to explain to her what the actual reason was for his\u00a0 absence. Being the gossip hound she is, Louise took one look at Dan\u2019s bruised face, his split lip, and along with the account she\u2019d gotten from PJ about the incident at Prom (PJ was not there of course, being younger than Dan, but his knowledge was still plentiful as far as Dan can tell thanks to the St Anthony rumour mill), sniffed a scandal. Dan just answered her questions with vague deflections, not wanting to go into the whole drama of it quite yet. She\u2019ll get it out of him eventually, she always does.</p><p>It\u2019s Friday, so the caf\u00e9 is rammed, made worse by the fact that seemingly half of St Anthony\u2019s student body is in here, because half term is next week, and the school decided to make today an inset day as a special treat. Dan hasn\u2019t had a spare minute to clean the milk jugs properly, let alone have a fag break. He\u2019s been on his feet since 10am, and it\u2019s getting dark outside. The windows are opaque with condensation from the non-stop chatter of the students, not to mention the hot coffees Dan keeps churning out for them.</p><p>In a way, Dan is glad he hasn\u2019t had a moment to breathe, because he\u2019s barely holding himself together after the events of the past few days. If he lets his mind wander from the temperature of the milk he\u2019s frothing, or which table has to be cleared next, he\u2019ll start to think of Phil, and what Dan had told him about needing to be apart, and then his heart will ache at the idea of returning to a solitary life, watching Phil hold Amanda\u2019s hand down the school hallway every day. Dan knocks over the pot of demerara sugar packets as he hands a customer a takeaway flat white. The packets spill onto the floor behind the counter, and Dan curses, crouching down to start picking them up. As he does, he hears the annoying tinkle of the bell as yet another person enters.</p><p>\u201cLouise!\u201d He calls. \u201cCould you come serve this customer, please?\u201d</p><p>She bustles out, irritated no doubt because she prefers to be a \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 kind of manager.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, stepping around Dan\u2019s huddled form as she approaches the till. Dan glances up in time to watch as a smile spreads onto her face. \u201cPhil, what can I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dan?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is urgent. </p><p>Dan freezes at the sound of him. Something about Phil\u2019s energy must be a warning sign for Louise, because she sneaks a subtle look down at Dan before responding. Dan shakes his head slowly, begging her to stay silent.</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d Louise says, looking back to Phil. Dan shuffles closer to the wall of the counter, trying not to make a sound. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he come into work today?\u201d Phil asks in that same pressing voice. \u201cHe said he was going to. I need to see him, I have to tell him\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan waits, but he doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cI could take a message for him?\u201d Louise\u2019s voice is gentle. Dan is so grateful for her, in this moment.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell him\u2026\u201d A crack runs through Phil\u2019s words, as though they\u2019re about to splinter apart. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m too late, and it\u2019s my fault, and I\u2019m sorry. And tell him I was blind, and that he\u2019s perfect, and I\u2019ve never actually wanted anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Dan stands up. Phil is wearing a black beanie hat with a Gengar on it, his glasses are beginning to fog up, and he\u2019s got a light haze of stubble on his jaw. His mouth opens a little when he sees Dan, obviously stunned by his sudden appearance. Louise takes a slow step backwards, a wildly excited glint in her eye at the prospect of imminent drama.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart is thrumming at the base of his throat. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>For a seemingly endless few seconds, all Phil does is stare, and Dan wonders if he misheard. </p><p>\u201cDan, I- I couldn\u2019t see it. I wouldn\u2019t let myself.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of vague, irritatingly ambiguous answer that Dan just doesn\u2019t have the patience for right now. The frustration - from this conversation, from the slew of dead ends he\u2019s been facing, from his boring life, from the constant ache in his bruised face - finally boils over. He huffs, rolling his eyes, swiping the pot of sugar up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d He slams the pot of sugar back in its place with a thwack, and pushes through the door at his rear into the kitchen.</p><p>Phil, of course, follows him straight in. \u201cIt makes sense now,\u201d he\u2019s saying, bizarrely. Dan takes him by the arm and drags him out of the kitchen, annoyed. \u201cI think part of me woke up to it when I kissed you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s speaking too loudly, Dan realises a fraction too late. The immediate vicinity of student-packed tables turn in surprise, ears pricking at the words leaving Phil\u2019s mouth. Great, Dan thinks, just what he needs. More fuel for the St Anthony\u2019s gossip train about his extra-curricular activities. He drops Phil\u2019s arm like it\u2019s burning, and shoots him a harsh glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cI thought I told you not to come in here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please listen,\u201d Phil begs. Dan just ignores him, swiping a nearby tray and beginning to angrily load dirty cups onto it from one of the tables of onlookers. The crockery clatters and knocks together, maybe chipping, but Dan can\u2019t find it in himself to care. Phil rambles on, voice raising over the noise. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining myself very well, my mind\u2019s all floopy. Amanda said it so well-\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, Dan drops the tray. A lot of it survives, but a teapot smashes into pieces, which ricochet across the floor. Some of the onlookers clap and jeer, not helping Dan\u2019s growing feelings of vexation. Immediately Phil is on his knees, scrambling to collect the pieces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Dan snaps, dropping to his knees as well. He bats Phil\u2019s hands away from the broken pieces. \u201cYou\u2019ll slice your hand open, let me do it.\u201d</p><p>Phil watches without argument as Dan gathers the larger bits and puts them carefully on the tray. Louise approaches, brandishing a dustpan and brush. She inclines her head, telling them both without words to move aside. As Dan stands, Phil steps towards him, catching hold of his wrists. Dan backs up, but Phil just moves with him, holding tight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it so that you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Phil says. There\u2019s a desperation so deep, so strong in his face that Dan stops trying. He\u2019s going to have to endure, to listen to whatever ridiculous speech Phil is about to give. He sighs, trying uselessly to steel himself for the cut of the jagged knife in Phil\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can find the right words. So here.\u201d</p><p>At first, Dan is baffled. Phil is digging into his jeans pocket, and then he tucks something into Dan\u2019s fist. Slowly, Dan\u2019s eyes lower to it, and he unfurls his fingers. There, laid in the centre of his palm, are two black pearls, fixed onto thin silver stems.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Dan says, locked on the earrings. \u201cDid she not want them?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head. He smells so dreamy, this close. Like fresh rainwater, sweetened with a splash of syrup. \u201cThey\u2019re yours, Dan. They were always yours.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows around a lump of coal lodged in his throat. His heart is doing that strange thrumming again; this time he can feel it right down in his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYou bought these for Amanda,\u201d Dan says, though his voice wobbles, like he\u2019s not sure of that truth.</p><p>Phil smiles very slightly. \u201cI thought so, too. But I was kidding myself, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d He plucks one of the earrings and slips the back off. He\u2019s gentle, almost reverent, as he reaches up, pressing it into Dan\u2019s ear. When it\u2019s fastened, Dan is utterly still, too bemused to move an inch. Phil leans back, a breath of laughter escaping. \u201cAnyone with half a brain could see. These are made for you.\u201d</p><p>Something hot and stinging smarts Dan\u2019s eyes, the back of his nose. \u201cWhat- what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m in love with my best friend,\u201d Phil says. He\u2019s reaching past Dan\u2019s cheek, to fix the other earring in place. \u201cI\u2019m saying I always have been.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s vaguely aware of an audience, watching what has become quite the scene, silently gawping at a confession Dan could not have predicted if he tried. All he can hear are the words Phil just spoke. </p><p><i>In love. </i></p><p><i>In love with my best friend.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat about Amanda?\u201d</p><p>Phil has inched closer now. Too close for friends. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Phil whispers, and then kisses him. </p><p>It\u2019s light, angelic, as if he\u2019s scared Dan\u2019s going to bolt out of the door. It\u2019s such a sweet, gentle kiss that Dan thinks he might die from the softness. Instead he falls in, headfirst, helpless to surrender to the weighty swell of watery affection that swamps around him, drowning him in the warm euphoria of his deepest desire.</p><p><b>(Chapter 11 coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

As a child, all Dan wanted was to be his older brother, to emulate him, or at least to befriend him. </p>[[MORE]]<p>A thick pulse of sudden wind sweeps over Dan, and he shivers. Without a jacket, the early morning is almost unbearably cold. He shoves his hands as deeply as he can into his shallow jean pockets, and walks on.\u00a0</p><p>Rather than dwell on what awaits him at home, Dan imagines he is back in Phil\u2019s bed, weighted by his soft blue-green duvet, Phil\u2019s silky hair tickling his cheek. Phil gets too close in the night. He doesn\u2019t mean to, but he\u2019s drawn to warmth unconsciously, like a cat sprawling in a sunbeam. Dan had woken up early to the press of his body, to the sighs of his sleep, long fingers resting on his abdomen. He couldn\u2019t stand the touch of him, in the light of day. He\u2019d stolen out of Phil\u2019s bedroom before even Mrs Lester was roused. He wishes he had somewhere else to return to, but having been kicked out of Ozone, and having pissed off Sam and Ben, Dan is officially out of options. He knew he\u2019d have to face Ricky eventually, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less horrific of a reality.</p><p>The walk between his and Phil\u2019s house is maybe ten minutes at the most, but despite his pathetic attempt to dawdle and drag it out, the cold spurs him onwards, and he arrives far too soon. The light is on in Ricky\u2019s bedroom window; he\u2019ll likely be getting ready for work. Dan glances at Ricky\u2019s car, parked in the driveway still, silent, unknowingly the root of all this trouble. Dan takes a deep breath, then lets himself in the front door.</p><p>It takes under a minute for Ricky to appear at the top of the stairs, having heard the door open no doubt. His shirt is half buttoned, and his knee high black socks are the only clothing on his bare shins. At least he\u2019s wearing boxers.</p><p>\u201cYou little shit,\u201d Ricky hisses, then thunders down the stairs. Dan swallows hard, trying to remain composed as he approaches. \u201cThink you can just steal my fucking car? Think I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><p>His hands are already balled into fists.</p><p>\u201cBrought it back, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Ricky grabs him by the shirt and shoves him hard against the door, growling. Dan squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable blow. It doesn\u2019t come straight away. Seconds pass, and still no impact, so Dan opens one eye, meeting Ricky\u2019s glare.</p><p>His brother is breathing hard, chest puffing out. His fist has fallen to his side, though he still has ahold of Dan by the shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re all\u2026\u201d Ricky says, then gestures to Dan\u2019s cheek, making him flinch. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your face?\u201d</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t answer. Whatever he says would make no difference anyway. He wishes Ricky would just get it over with, land his kicks or punches so they can move on. Once he gets his anger out, Ricky\u2019s at least a little easier to deal with. To Dan\u2019s astonishment, Ricky releases him instead. He takes a step back, surveying Dan carefully. </p><p>\u201cSomeone do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t dare reply, but his left shoulder comes up in a small shrug.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck\u2019s it matter, Ricky?\u201d Dan croaks out. \u201cYou pissed off someone got there first?\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s teeth clench. \u201cMum said some kid came round looking for you. Lanky, black hair. Glasses. Was it him?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to swallow the burst of hysterical laughter that surges up. The idea of Phil managing to injure anything larger than the moths he occasionally has to swat for Dan is bonkers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, choosing not to bother trying to explain this.</p><p>\u201cIf it was, I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Ricky says, absurdly. </p><p>Dan can\u2019t understand his brother\u2019s logic \u2013 it\u2019s apparently fine if Dan\u2019s injuries are caused by Ricky himself, but if it\u2019s anyone outside the family, that\u2019s obviously outrageous. But Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to probe Ricky for whatever half-witted explanation he might give, because at that moment, there\u2019s a knock on the other side of the door. Dan feels the three pounds vibrate down his back.</p><p>Ricky stares, deep lines creasing his Neanderthal forehead as he thinks about what to do. He grabs Dan\u2019s arm and yanks him away from the door, then wrenches it open. Dan wonders if he\u2019s forgotten he\u2019s not dressed. At the sight of Phil, standing ashen on his front step, Dan\u2019s blood runs cold. He stumbles forwards, attempting to push Ricky aside, but his brother is stocky, heavy-set. Dan\u2019s always been the twiglet, compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ricky says, drinking in the sight of Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re the nonce who was here the other day. Mum says you had a hand in stealing my car, an\u2019 all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan jumps in quickly. He has a hand hovering over Ricky\u2019s upper arm, primed to hold him back if he tries anything. \u201cNo, that was all me. He\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, his shoulders already slumping in relief at the sight of him. \u201cI woke up and you were gone. Are you alright-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d Ricky says to Phil. He takes a step over the threshold, getting closer to him. \u201cWere you involved in this? Did you see him nick it?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks from Ricky to Dan, at a loss. \u201cI-\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand makes contact with Ricky\u2019s shoulder and pulls hard, forcing him to turn. \u201cRicky, it was me. All me. I stole your keys off the counter, I snuck out while you were in your room, I drove the car to Prom.\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s eyes are fiery and dark. He opens his mouth to retort, to yell perhaps, but then Phil speaks.</p><p>\u201cBut I made him,\u201d he says. Dan could throttle him. \u201cI asked him to take it for the night. I bribed him, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, shut up,\u201d Dan hisses.</p><p>Phil ignores him. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. If you wanna be pissed at anyone it should be me. Dan\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>This last comment is just strange enough to kill Dan\u2019s argument before it forms. Ricky is silent in the face of Phil\u2019s words. He\u2019s squinting at Phil, like he\u2019s trying to figure him out. Phil is dressed bizarrely, in black jogging bottoms, a Halloween jumper, and a galaxy printed jacket. He\u2019s obviously rolled straight out of bed. Even his shoelaces are untied. Did he honestly wake up, realise Dan was gone and run right after him?</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Ricky suddenly declares. </p><p>He turns from Phil, shoving past Dan back into the house. Dan holds his breath, staying perfectly still as he listens to Ricky\u2019s feet pounding up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did we get away with it?\u201d Phil asks into the silence Ricky left them standing in.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to get away with,\u201d Dan replies, tetchy. \u201cThat was really fucking stupid, trying to take the blame like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil just shrugs. It\u2019s infuriating, how lightly he\u2019s taking this. Dan\u2019s heart has only just ceased pounding. \u201cI was so worried when I woke up this morning and you were gone,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI knew you had nowhere else to go but here, back to Ricky. I thought if I came and backed you up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan\u2019s through keeping a lid on the anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking school! My brother isn\u2019t Hardy Jenns or Sam the sound tech. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He lifts up his shirt, exposing his left side, where a patch of raw, shiny pink skin is visible. \u201cYou know what this is? It\u2019s from when I was nine, and I broke Ricky\u2019s CD Walkman by accident, so he picked up Dad\u2019s boiling hot coffee and threw it at me.\u201d Dan lets the shirt fall, then yanks his collar to one side, exposing his big floral tattoo. \u201cI got this done to cover up the scar from Ricky shoving me through a glass door when I was thirteen, right after Dad died, because I chickened out of speaking at the funeral.\u201d Dan sticks out his wrist, exposing more scars, more reminders. \u201cThese are from fights, from him pushing me over, or into doors or walls, and just from being smacked about all my damn life.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a breath, not able to meet Phil\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI have more,\u201d Dan says, voice cracking. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking violent, Phil. You can\u2019t piss him off. I can\u2019t see you be hurt like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil moves closer, so Dan takes a step back. They\u2019re both inside now, which is terrifying in itself for Dan, because Ricky is still upstairs. Dan had done so well keeping Phil from his family until now. He never wanted them to know of his existence, never wanted Phil to so much as be a blip on Ricky\u2019s radar. Dan vaguely notices he\u2019s crying, just from pure overwhelm, but he still doesn\u2019t expect it when Phil\u2019s arms wrap around him. It takes a minute, but eventually he just cant be bothered to resist. Phil is a warm, calm safety blanket. He smells like cinnamon and sweets, and he\u2019s offering himself to Dan, now, when he needs that blanket most, so Dan just melts into it. Phil doesn\u2019t say a word, he just holds tight, letting Dan sniffle and dampen his jacket.</p><p>Eventually Dan pulls free, wiping his sodden face with his sleeve. \u201cYou need to go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on,\u201d Phil replies quickly. He reaches for Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can come home with me again, just grab your stuff and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, stressing the word. He meets Phil\u2019s gaze somehow, though he knows he must look far from ferocious, with his piggy eyes and damp cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t be around you. We need to just\u2026\u201d Dan threads shaky fingers through his hair. He needs a shower, badly. \u201cWe need to spend some time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounds alarmed. \u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d Dan says, shutting him up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m driving you crazy. Things are\u2026 different. You have a girlfriend, and I just don\u2019t fit into that. Let\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d Phil says, frantic. He\u2019s trying to reach for Dan\u2019s hand, but Dan won\u2019t let him take hold. \u201cDan, we can get past this-\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cI have to get to work,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve skipped two shifts already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come in later.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes, begging. \u201cPlease, Phil,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Phil reaches the top of the hill, he\u2019s out of breath. He ran some of the way, and when he couldn\u2019t keep it up, slowed to a sort-of half jog. He spotted Amanda sat on the bench from the bottom of the hill, her thick curls buffeting about in the strong wind. She\u2019s facing away from him, so thankfully doesn\u2019t notice him puffing as he climbs the steep incline towards her.</p><p>At last he reaches her, and immediately begins apologising \u2013 he\u2019s almost an hour late to meet her here. She regards him a little worriedly, her big doe eyes round as she takes him in. She\u2019s wearing gold eyeshadow, making the chocolate-brown of her irises seem even richer.</p><p>\u201c\u2026so so sorry, I just got caught up, and then we sort of got in a fight, and-\u201d</p><p>Amanda holds up her hand to quiet him, alarmed. \u201cFight? Who did you fight with?\u201d</p><p>Phil flops down beside Amanda on the bench, unable to fight for breath standing upright any longer. \u201cDan,\u201d he says. \u201cI was at Dan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Amanda says. She lowers her hand, studying her pink fingernails. \u201cI thought you went home last night.\u201d</p><p>Yesterday evening, Phil had been at Amanda\u2019s house, helping her transport the enormous painting he\u2019d done of her into her bedroom. Her mum wasn\u2019t there, but her younger brothers, Jake and Aidan, had been. At nine and eleven, they were gleeful at having something to tease their sister about:</p><p><i>\u201cIs this your new boyfriend?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid he paint this picture of you?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it cos he lurrves you?\u201d</i></p><p>Phil had endured it with a smile, but their constant presence had not left a great deal of opportunity for him and Amanda to be alone.</p><p><i>\u201cWho looks after them when you and your mum aren\u2019t here?\u201d</i> Phil had asked, furtively, whilst Amanda was cooking the boys\u2019 dinner.</p><p><i>\u201cNobody,\u201d</i> Amanda replied. <i>\u201cSo I\u2019m pretty much always here.\u201d</i></p><p>Distracted as she was by her siblings, Phil spent a lot of the evening sat on Amanda\u2019s sofa, halfway through a Mario Kart race that Jake and Aidan had been too excitable to finish, his mind wandering to things he\u2019d been trying not to think about. Dan. Prom. The fight.</p><p>So, just as the boys were getting into their pyjamas, Phil decided he\u2019d head home. Amanda had her hands full, and despite trying to help her, Phil clearly was only getting in the way. She apologised about it, said they could meet up the next morning at the viewpoint up the hill by the park. Phil kissed her goodbye - on the cheek, her brothers were watching \u2013 and started to walk home. Then, he caught sight of the bus into town idling at the stop. Until that moment, he\u2019d been lying to himself that Dan would be more sensible than hanging out at Ozone for the past three days instead of coming into work or school. But seeing the bus just sat there, as if waiting for him to climb on, Phil couldn\u2019t keep up the pretence. He\u2019d jumped on straight away, barged into the club and found Dan off his face, snogging some creepy sound guy. He\u2019d managed to drag him home to stay over, after a lot of persuading and an almost-fight.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil replies, stretching the truth just a tad. \u201cDan\u2026 came over. After I left yours. This morning I\u2026 went round his for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Amanda nods in a way that screams \u2018bullshit\u2019. \u201cI thought he was pissed at you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s an angry guy.\u201d He settles back into the bench, eyes glazing as he recalls some of this anger. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen his face though, Jesus. Half black and blue from the fight. I still think Hardy got off worse, but I bet Dan\u2019s gonna be wearing that shiner for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Amanda says. \u201cSounds awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he stayed at yours last night?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to her. He feels a quick rush of guilt, but it recedes soon after. \u201cYeah. He was\u2026 upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea why?\u201d</p><p>Phil gnaws his lip. \u201cBecause of the fight, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s following sigh is deep, as if she\u2019s summoned it from a well of despair. \u201cPhil, we need to have a chat.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is just the same as his mum\u2019s was, when she explained that she couldn\u2019t afford to send Phil to art lessons anymore, and that he\u2019d just have to watch online videos, or read books at the library, and teach himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Phil asks, though his heart pounds.</p><p>Amanda sighs again, looking out at the view in front of her. From this spot, high on a hill, at the fringe of an ugly, usually empty car park, the whole of the town is visible. From such a high vantage point, it\u2019s worryingly easy to see the stark difference between the upper side and the lower, sliced as they are by the railway down the middle. On the lower side, Phil\u2019s side, the houses are crushed together, mostly semi-detached, with a few grey blocks of estate flats placed here and there. I\u2019s all residential, pretty much, apart from the odd off-licence lurking ominously on a street corner, it\u2019s neon \u201924-hour\u2019 sign buzzing faintly.</p><p>The other side is quite literally greener, as the gardens of the wealthier people\u2019s houses sprawl, covered in pretty flowers and big ponds. The houses are way up on the furthest reaches of the town, as far from the ugly side as they can get, and the middle is full of neat, modern offices, streets of clothes shops and caf\u00e9s, and of course the big fountain in the midst of it all, right by where Ozone is hidden, half-underground. As Amanda observes all of this, Phil wonders what she must think of it. She detests it, probably. Or maybe just longs to hop across that train track for good.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like me, Phil?\u201d</p><p>He turns to her, dumbfounded. For most, even just to glimpse her from afar would be enough of an answer to that question. \u201cUh\u2026 lots of reasons.\u201d</p><p>She turns to him. She looks worn out, her pretty features drooping. \u201cNo, honestly. I want you to tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Baffled, Phil\u2019s mind begins to reel, collecting all the reasons. He can\u2019t imagine Amanda is asking because of a hidden insecurity \u2013 she must be well aware of how much she is wanted by every female-liking person that catches a whiff of her knock-off perfume.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re funny,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou\u2019re really quite sharp, and sarcastic \u2013 it surprised me at first.\u201d</p><p>She nods, still with that worn-out look masking her face. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd um, you\u2019re gorgeous obviously,\u201d Phil says, blushing. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it. Your hair, and your eyes. And the way you smile - glowing. It\u2019s like you\u2019re three steps ahead of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like a dick,\u201d Amanda says, but she\u2019s smiling now, sort of. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find you just\u2026 super interesting,\u201d Phil confesses. He looks at his hands. \u201cThe life you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. You wanted this impossible thing - to be with the Elite despite your background. And you didn\u2019t let anything stop you. You fought for it.\u201d Phil is quiet for a moment, pensive. The wind sweeps one of Amanda\u2019s curls across his cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t even really get on with the Elite people. But being one of them\u2026 it\u2019s how you cope. It\u2019s like by hiding out with them, pretending to be something you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re escaping everything else.\u201d He glances at her worriedly. \u201cI might be getting this all wrong, feel free to sock me if I\u2019m being a twat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amanda says, shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s bang on, actually. I can\u2019t face my real life for too long, so I go hang out with a bunch of brain-dead morons, tag along to the parties they go to, pretend I\u2019m not\u2026 me.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods. \u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating. I admire your courage to do that every day. It must be so hard to keep it up.\u201d</p><p>Amanda is staring at him again. She looks as if she\u2019s waiting for something to click in Phil\u2019s mind. Phil just cocks his head to one side, totally in the dark. One last time, she heaves a sigh, then brings her hands up to untwist the earring from her left ear. Immediately, Phil is alarmed, and can only sit, wide-eyed, as she untwists the other, too. She holds them out to him in her tiny, pale hand. They look big, dark in her palm. Two blackcurrants in a pool of milk.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Phil,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course I do-\u201d</p><p>She places her other hand, the one not cupping the earrings, on his shoulder. As she leans in, her expression is kind, if a little condescending. \u201cNo. I want you to try and get this for yourself, Phil. I think you need to be the one to realise it, or you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Phil can feel the panic welling up. It\u2019s as if he can feel her slipping through his fingers. Surely there must be some way to hold on to her. He\u2019s already won her once, he can do it again. \u201cI asked you to Prom because I like you, because I want to be with you, because you deserve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I deserve better,\u201d Amanda finishes. \u201cBecause seedy guys are treating me like a piece of ass. Because I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m more than where I come from. Because you want to draw me, to show me that I\u2019m beautiful. To give me fancy things, so I can feel I\u2019m worth them. You want to hold me and kiss me and tell me that I\u2019m precious, and that I\u2019m safe, and that I\u2019m the most important thing to you, even if I don\u2019t matter to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes are watery. He\u2019s so scared of what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s sliced that brown-eyed gaze straight through his forehead, into his soft, mushy mind. </p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Amanda smiles. It\u2019s a gorgeous, radiant smile. She looks down into her hand, where the two black pearls lay, still. \u201cThese aren\u2019t meant for me, Phil. They belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>It takes Phil a moment, and then the penny drops. It drops like a stone into his gut, sending bubbles of hysterical laughter up his gullet, out of his throat. \u201cAre you talking about Dan?\u201d He asks, voice high. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not- I\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>Amanda reaches out, and Phil doesn\u2019t understand why until he feels her sweep away a tear from his cheek. \u201cIt was Dan that you took to Prom, Phil.\u201d Something about her tone is so sure, so unwaveringly honest, that Phil doesn\u2019t try to contradict her. \u201cIt was him you bought the earrings for. It\u2019s him you\u2019re worried about, him you\u2019d fight off a thousand dickheads for. It\u2019s him you want, that you think deserves the world, that you think should be with you. It\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d <i>understand</i>, Phil wants to say. He presses a hand to his forehead, his cheek. He feels warm, despite the wintry chill. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I think?\u201d Amanda asks. She takes hold of his hand, bringing it away from his face, clasping it. \u201cI think you have a huge well of kindness inside of you. I think you\u2019ve stored it up over years. You were waiting for the right person to give it to. And then you met that person, but he was stubborn, and he was defensive, and he wouldn\u2019t accept it. That\u2019s how he is. Fences built up sky high, all around him. So your well, it just kept building up. So much you were bursting with all this untapped, raw love and affection, all of it for him.\u201d </p><p>Amanda pauses. Phil feels his lungs growing tighter, as if he\u2019s climbing the hill again, stuck ascending it forever. He waits, struggling for air, for what she\u2019ll say next.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you saw me,\u201d Amanda says with a soft smile. \u201cAnd I am Dan. In so many ways. We grew up the same. We have the same attitude. We bury our shame in men that abuse us. We even look similar. Our hair. Our eyes. So you convinced yourself that it was me you wanted. That out of nowhere, I was the one for you. You didn\u2019t let yourself think it was Dan, not ever, because of those fences he has, keeping you away.\u201d She squeezes his hand. \u201cDo you think I might be right?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mind is reeling. It\u2019s a ferris wheel, going too fast, and rocking violently in a thunderstorm. The bolts and screws that keep it together are threatening to burst from their grooves. It\u2019s all about to come crashing down. Everything he\u2019s been so sure of, all that\u2019s been driving him for months. He looks at Amanda, tortured. Her smile is still in place. A film star smile, truly. As beautiful as looking straight at a burning, bright star. </p><p>But even though it is dazzling to behold her, windswept and as totally beguiling as she has ever been, deep in his soul, Phil knows. He\u2019s seen a better smile, one that cuts a dimple into a rounded cheek. He\u2019s seen browner eyes, that leak gold and caramel and ochre. He\u2019s felt softer curls against his fingers. He\u2019s heard a rarer, sweeter laugh, and a deeper, richer voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so sorry,\u201d Phil says. It\u2019s utterly gut-wrenching, to know, in his aching, guilty soul, that she is right. \u201cI\u2019ve strung you along all this time\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to, Phil,\u201d Amanda says softly. She presses the earrings into his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I doubt you even know how much you\u2019ve helped me, despite this. You reminded me that people like you exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like me,\u201d Phil scoffs. He shakes his head, eyes stinging. \u201cIdiots that blunder into things they\u2019ve half thought about. People that hurt everyone around them because they\u2019re too pig-headed to see two feet in front of their nose.\u201d</p><p>Amanda squeezes his hand. \u201cPeople that can fall so deeply, excruciatingly in love with someone that they\u2019re blind from it. If the past few days have been any glimpse of how generous, and sweet, and kind you\u2019d be with the person you love\u2026\u201d She shakes her head, eyebrows raised. \u201cDan\u2019s a heck of a lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can be okay with this,\u201d Phil sniffs, trying to ignore the heavy blush fizzing in his cheeks. \u201cWhen you said yes to Prom with me you lost everything. All the work you put in, getting in with the Elites\u2026 it\u2019s all for nothing. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you did me a favour, getting me out of that nightmare.\u201d Amanda smiles, that mischievous glimmer in her gold shadowed eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for me to stand on my own two feet for a while. Don\u2019t worry about me, okay? You\u2019ve got enough to deal with.\u201d She squeezes his hand a final time, and lets go. \u201cI\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s on the doghouse shift, because Louise is pissed at him for skipping work the past few days. She\u2019d had to cover for him when Hardy\u2019s dad came in, apparently, lying that he was ill with flu. The only reason Dan isn\u2019t fired, according to Louise, is because in all the years Dan\u2019s worked here, and all the extra shifts he\u2019s taken on, he\u2019s never before missed work.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you mop the floor tonight too,\u201d Louise shouts to Dan from the kitchen.</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes in secret. \u201cYeah, I will.\u201d</p><p>Privately, Dan suspects that Louise is a little extra pissed off because he refused to explain to her what the actual reason was for his\u00a0 absence. Being the gossip hound she is, Louise took one look at Dan\u2019s bruised face, his split lip, and along with the account she\u2019d gotten from PJ about the incident at Prom (PJ was not there of course, being younger than Dan, but his knowledge was still plentiful as far as Dan can tell thanks to the St Anthony rumour mill), sniffed a scandal. Dan just answered her questions with vague deflections, not wanting to go into the whole drama of it quite yet. She\u2019ll get it out of him eventually, she always does.</p><p>It\u2019s Friday, so the caf\u00e9 is rammed, made worse by the fact that seemingly half of St Anthony\u2019s student body is in here, because half term is next week, and the school decided to make today an inset day as a special treat. Dan hasn\u2019t had a spare minute to clean the milk jugs properly, let alone have a fag break. He\u2019s been on his feet since 10am, and it\u2019s getting dark outside. The windows are opaque with condensation from the non-stop chatter of the students, not to mention the hot coffees Dan keeps churning out for them.</p><p>In a way, Dan is glad he hasn\u2019t had a moment to breathe, because he\u2019s barely holding himself together after the events of the past few days. If he lets his mind wander from the temperature of the milk he\u2019s frothing, or which table has to be cleared next, he\u2019ll start to think of Phil, and what Dan had told him about needing to be apart, and then his heart will ache at the idea of returning to a solitary life, watching Phil hold Amanda\u2019s hand down the school hallway every day. Dan knocks over the pot of demerara sugar packets as he hands a customer a takeaway flat white. The packets spill onto the floor behind the counter, and Dan curses, crouching down to start picking them up. As he does, he hears the annoying tinkle of the bell as yet another person enters.</p><p>\u201cLouise!\u201d He calls. \u201cCould you come serve this customer, please?\u201d</p><p>She bustles out, irritated no doubt because she prefers to be a \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 kind of manager.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, stepping around Dan\u2019s huddled form as she approaches the till. Dan glances up in time to watch as a smile spreads onto her face. \u201cPhil, what can I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dan?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is urgent. </p><p>Dan freezes at the sound of him. Something about Phil\u2019s energy must be a warning sign for Louise, because she sneaks a subtle look down at Dan before responding. Dan shakes his head slowly, begging her to stay silent.</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d Louise says, looking back to Phil. Dan shuffles closer to the wall of the counter, trying not to make a sound. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he come into work today?\u201d Phil asks in that same pressing voice. \u201cHe said he was going to. I need to see him, I have to tell him\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan waits, but he doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cI could take a message for him?\u201d Louise\u2019s voice is gentle. Dan is so grateful for her, in this moment.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell him\u2026\u201d A crack runs through Phil\u2019s words, as though they\u2019re about to splinter apart. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m too late, and it\u2019s my fault, and I\u2019m sorry. And tell him I was blind, and that he\u2019s perfect, and I\u2019ve never actually wanted anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Dan stands up. Phil is wearing a black beanie hat with a Gengar on it, his glasses are beginning to fog up, and he\u2019s got a light haze of stubble on his jaw. His mouth opens a little when he sees Dan, obviously stunned by his sudden appearance. Louise takes a slow step backwards, a wildly excited glint in her eye at the prospect of imminent drama.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart is thrumming at the base of his throat. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>For a seemingly endless few seconds, all Phil does is stare, and Dan wonders if he misheard. </p><p>\u201cDan, I- I couldn\u2019t see it. I wouldn\u2019t let myself.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of vague, irritatingly ambiguous answer that Dan just doesn\u2019t have the patience for right now. The frustration - from this conversation, from the slew of dead ends he\u2019s been facing, from his boring life, from the constant ache in his bruised face - finally boils over. He huffs, rolling his eyes, swiping the pot of sugar up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d He slams the pot of sugar back in its place with a thwack, and pushes through the door at his rear into the kitchen.</p><p>Phil, of course, follows him straight in. \u201cIt makes sense now,\u201d he\u2019s saying, bizarrely. Dan takes him by the arm and drags him out of the kitchen, annoyed. \u201cI think part of me woke up to it when I kissed you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s speaking too loudly, Dan realises a fraction too late. The immediate vicinity of student-packed tables turn in surprise, ears pricking at the words leaving Phil\u2019s mouth. Great, Dan thinks, just what he needs. More fuel for the St Anthony\u2019s gossip train about his extra-curricular activities. He drops Phil\u2019s arm like it\u2019s burning, and shoots him a harsh glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cI thought I told you not to come in here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please listen,\u201d Phil begs. Dan just ignores him, swiping a nearby tray and beginning to angrily load dirty cups onto it from one of the tables of onlookers. The crockery clatters and knocks together, maybe chipping, but Dan can\u2019t find it in himself to care. Phil rambles on, voice raising over the noise. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining myself very well, my mind\u2019s all floopy. Amanda said it so well-\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, Dan drops the tray. A lot of it survives, but a teapot smashes into pieces, which ricochet across the floor. Some of the onlookers clap and jeer, not helping Dan\u2019s growing feelings of vexation. Immediately Phil is on his knees, scrambling to collect the pieces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Dan snaps, dropping to his knees as well. He bats Phil\u2019s hands away from the broken pieces. \u201cYou\u2019ll slice your hand open, let me do it.\u201d</p><p>Phil watches without argument as Dan gathers the larger bits and puts them carefully on the tray. Louise approaches, brandishing a dustpan and brush. She inclines her head, telling them both without words to move aside. As Dan stands, Phil steps towards him, catching hold of his wrists. Dan backs up, but Phil just moves with him, holding tight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it so that you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Phil says. There\u2019s a desperation so deep, so strong in his face that Dan stops trying. He\u2019s going to have to endure, to listen to whatever ridiculous speech Phil is about to give. He sighs, trying uselessly to steel himself for the cut of the jagged knife in Phil\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can find the right words. So here.\u201d</p><p>At first, Dan is baffled. Phil is digging into his jeans pocket, and then he tucks something into Dan\u2019s fist. Slowly, Dan\u2019s eyes lower to it, and he unfurls his fingers. There, laid in the centre of his palm, are two black pearls, fixed onto thin silver stems.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Dan says, locked on the earrings. \u201cDid she not want them?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head. He smells so dreamy, this close. Like fresh rainwater, sweetened with a splash of syrup. \u201cThey\u2019re yours, Dan. They were always yours.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows around a lump of coal lodged in his throat. His heart is doing that strange thrumming again; this time he can feel it right down in his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYou bought these for Amanda,\u201d Dan says, though his voice wobbles, like he\u2019s not sure of that truth.</p><p>Phil smiles very slightly. \u201cI thought so, too. But I was kidding myself, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d He plucks one of the earrings and slips the back off. He\u2019s gentle, almost reverent, as he reaches up, pressing it into Dan\u2019s ear. When it\u2019s fastened, Dan is utterly still, too bemused to move an inch. Phil leans back, a breath of laughter escaping. \u201cAnyone with half a brain could see. These are made for you.\u201d</p><p>Something hot and stinging smarts Dan\u2019s eyes, the back of his nose. \u201cWhat- what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m in love with my best friend,\u201d Phil says. He\u2019s reaching past Dan\u2019s cheek, to fix the other earring in place. \u201cI\u2019m saying I always have been.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s vaguely aware of an audience, watching what has become quite the scene, silently gawping at a confession Dan could not have predicted if he tried. All he can hear are the words Phil just spoke. </p><p><i>In love. </i></p><p><i>In love with my best friend.</i></p><p>\u201cWhat about Amanda?\u201d</p><p>Phil has inched closer now. Too close for friends. </p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Phil whispers, and then kisses him. </p><p>It\u2019s light, angelic, as if he\u2019s scared Dan\u2019s going to bolt out of the door. It\u2019s such a sweet, gentle kiss that Dan thinks he might die from the softness. Instead he falls in, headfirst, helpless to surrender to the weighty swell of watery affection that swamps around him, drowning him in the warm euphoria of his deepest desire.</p><p><b>(Chapter 11 coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

The barren path he trudges down is frosted with a sheet of white, thinner than a sleeve of cr\u00eape paper. The route home from Phil\u2019s winds around the town\u2019s park - a generous term for the patch of grass near a Primary school, vaguely upkept by an elderly man in a jumpsuit occasionally seen pulling weeds. The cold, endless winter has left the park dry and brown, a perfect reflection of Dan\u2019s mood. There\u2019s a dilapidated children\u2019s playground at one end of the park, surrounded by a chain link fence. Inside, the metal swings and climbing frames are rusted to the point of danger. It\u2019s doubtful that any sound-minded parents allow their kids to brave them anymore.\u00a0</p><p>As he walks by the skate park at the other end, Dan slows a little, surveying what\u2019s become of it. When he was around seven or eight, Dan would sneak out here to watch Ricky skate with his friends. He\u2019d loiter at the edge of the concrete, pretending to be just passing by. Ricky would yell at him to go home, tell him he was too young to be there and to stop pestering him. Dan recalls the sneer on his brother\u2019s face so clearly, even now. At twelve years old, Ricky was just as mean, just as angry as he is today. It didn\u2019t deter Dan, back then. As a child, all Dan wanted was to be his older brother, to emulate him, or at least to befriend him. </p>[[MORE]]<p>A thick pulse of sudden wind sweeps over Dan, and he shivers. Without a jacket, the early morning is almost unbearably cold. He shoves his hands as deeply as he can into his shallow jean pockets, and walks on.\u00a0</p><p>Rather than dwell on what awaits him at home, Dan imagines he is back in Phil\u2019s bed, weighted by his soft blue-green duvet, Phil\u2019s silky hair tickling his cheek. Phil gets too close in the night. He doesn\u2019t mean to, but he\u2019s drawn to warmth unconsciously, like a cat sprawling in a sunbeam. Dan had woken up early to the press of his body, to the sighs of his sleep, long fingers resting on his abdomen. He couldn\u2019t stand the touch of him, in the light of day. He\u2019d stolen out of Phil\u2019s bedroom before even Mrs Lester was roused. He wishes he had somewhere else to return to, but having been kicked out of Ozone, and having pissed off Sam and Ben, Dan is officially out of options. He knew he\u2019d have to face Ricky eventually, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less horrific of a reality.</p><p>The walk between his and Phil\u2019s house is maybe ten minutes at the most, but despite his pathetic attempt to dawdle and drag it out, the cold spurs him onwards, and he arrives far too soon. The light is on in Ricky\u2019s bedroom window; he\u2019ll likely be getting ready for work. Dan glances at Ricky\u2019s car, parked in the driveway still, silent, unknowingly the root of all this trouble. Dan takes a deep breath, then lets himself in the front door.</p><p>It takes under a minute for Ricky to appear at the top of the stairs, having heard the door open no doubt. His shirt is half buttoned, and his knee high black socks are the only clothing on his bare shins. At least he\u2019s wearing boxers.</p><p>\u201cYou little shit,\u201d Ricky hisses, then thunders down the stairs. Dan swallows hard, trying to remain composed as he approaches. \u201cThink you can just steal my fucking car? Think I wouldn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><p>His hands are already balled into fists.</p><p>\u201cBrought it back, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Ricky grabs him by the shirt and shoves him hard against the door, growling. Dan squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable blow. It doesn\u2019t come straight away. Seconds pass, and still no impact, so Dan opens one eye, meeting Ricky\u2019s glare.</p><p>His brother is breathing hard, chest puffing out. His fist has fallen to his side, though he still has ahold of Dan by the shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re all\u2026\u201d Ricky says, then gestures to Dan\u2019s cheek, making him flinch. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your face?\u201d</p><p>Dan doesn\u2019t answer. Whatever he says would make no difference anyway. He wishes Ricky would just get it over with, land his kicks or punches so they can move on. Once he gets his anger out, Ricky\u2019s at least a little easier to deal with. To Dan\u2019s astonishment, Ricky releases him instead. He takes a step back, surveying Dan carefully. </p><p>\u201cSomeone do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Again, Dan doesn\u2019t dare reply, but his left shoulder comes up in a small shrug.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck\u2019s it matter, Ricky?\u201d Dan croaks out. \u201cYou pissed off someone got there first?\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s teeth clench. \u201cMum said some kid came round looking for you. Lanky, black hair. Glasses. Was it him?\u201d</p><p>Dan struggles to swallow the burst of hysterical laughter that surges up. The idea of Phil managing to injure anything larger than the moths he occasionally has to swat for Dan is bonkers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, choosing not to bother trying to explain this.</p><p>\u201cIf it was, I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Ricky says, absurdly. </p><p>Dan can\u2019t understand his brother\u2019s logic \u2013 it\u2019s apparently fine if Dan\u2019s injuries are caused by Ricky himself, but if it\u2019s anyone outside the family, that\u2019s obviously outrageous. But Dan doesn\u2019t get a chance to probe Ricky for whatever half-witted explanation he might give, because at that moment, there\u2019s a knock on the other side of the door. Dan feels the three pounds vibrate down his back.</p><p>Ricky stares, deep lines creasing his Neanderthal forehead as he thinks about what to do. He grabs Dan\u2019s arm and yanks him away from the door, then wrenches it open. Dan wonders if he\u2019s forgotten he\u2019s not dressed. At the sight of Phil, standing ashen on his front step, Dan\u2019s blood runs cold. He stumbles forwards, attempting to push Ricky aside, but his brother is stocky, heavy-set. Dan\u2019s always been the twiglet, compared to him.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Ricky says, drinking in the sight of Phil. \u201cYou\u2019re the nonce who was here the other day. Mum says you had a hand in stealing my car, an\u2019 all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan jumps in quickly. He has a hand hovering over Ricky\u2019s upper arm, primed to hold him back if he tries anything. \u201cNo, that was all me. He\u2019s got nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan,\u201d Phil says, his shoulders already slumping in relief at the sight of him. \u201cI woke up and you were gone. Are you alright-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOi, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 to you,\u201d Ricky says to Phil. He takes a step over the threshold, getting closer to him. \u201cWere you involved in this? Did you see him nick it?\u201d</p><p>Phil looks from Ricky to Dan, at a loss. \u201cI-\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s hand makes contact with Ricky\u2019s shoulder and pulls hard, forcing him to turn. \u201cRicky, it was me. All me. I stole your keys off the counter, I snuck out while you were in your room, I drove the car to Prom.\u201d</p><p>Ricky\u2019s eyes are fiery and dark. He opens his mouth to retort, to yell perhaps, but then Phil speaks.</p><p>\u201cBut I made him,\u201d he says. Dan could throttle him. \u201cI asked him to take it for the night. I bribed him, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, shut up,\u201d Dan hisses.</p><p>Phil ignores him. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. If you wanna be pissed at anyone it should be me. Dan\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>This last comment is just strange enough to kill Dan\u2019s argument before it forms. Ricky is silent in the face of Phil\u2019s words. He\u2019s squinting at Phil, like he\u2019s trying to figure him out. Phil is dressed bizarrely, in black jogging bottoms, a Halloween jumper, and a galaxy printed jacket. He\u2019s obviously rolled straight out of bed. Even his shoelaces are untied. Did he honestly wake up, realise Dan was gone and run right after him?</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d Ricky suddenly declares. </p><p>He turns from Phil, shoving past Dan back into the house. Dan holds his breath, staying perfectly still as he listens to Ricky\u2019s feet pounding up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2026 did we get away with it?\u201d Phil asks into the silence Ricky left them standing in.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to get away with,\u201d Dan replies, tetchy. \u201cThat was really fucking stupid, trying to take the blame like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil just shrugs. It\u2019s infuriating, how lightly he\u2019s taking this. Dan\u2019s heart has only just ceased pounding. \u201cI was so worried when I woke up this morning and you were gone,\u201d Phil says. \u201cI knew you had nowhere else to go but here, back to Ricky. I thought if I came and backed you up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil!\u201d Dan\u2019s through keeping a lid on the anger. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fucking school! My brother isn\u2019t Hardy Jenns or Sam the sound tech. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d He lifts up his shirt, exposing his left side, where a patch of raw, shiny pink skin is visible. \u201cYou know what this is? It\u2019s from when I was nine, and I broke Ricky\u2019s CD Walkman by accident, so he picked up Dad\u2019s boiling hot coffee and threw it at me.\u201d Dan lets the shirt fall, then yanks his collar to one side, exposing his big floral tattoo. \u201cI got this done to cover up the scar from Ricky shoving me through a glass door when I was thirteen, right after Dad died, because I chickened out of speaking at the funeral.\u201d Dan sticks out his wrist, exposing more scars, more reminders. \u201cThese are from fights, from him pushing me over, or into doors or walls, and just from being smacked about all my damn life.\u201d</p><p>Dan takes a breath, not able to meet Phil\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI have more,\u201d Dan says, voice cracking. \u201cHe\u2019s fucking violent, Phil. You can\u2019t piss him off. I can\u2019t see you be hurt like that.\u201d</p><p>Phil moves closer, so Dan takes a step back. They\u2019re both inside now, which is terrifying in itself for Dan, because Ricky is still upstairs. Dan had done so well keeping Phil from his family until now. He never wanted them to know of his existence, never wanted Phil to so much as be a blip on Ricky\u2019s radar. Dan vaguely notices he\u2019s crying, just from pure overwhelm, but he still doesn\u2019t expect it when Phil\u2019s arms wrap around him. It takes a minute, but eventually he just cant be bothered to resist. Phil is a warm, calm safety blanket. He smells like cinnamon and sweets, and he\u2019s offering himself to Dan, now, when he needs that blanket most, so Dan just melts into it. Phil doesn\u2019t say a word, he just holds tight, letting Dan sniffle and dampen his jacket.</p><p>Eventually Dan pulls free, wiping his sodden face with his sleeve. \u201cYou need to go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, come on,\u201d Phil replies quickly. He reaches for Dan\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can come home with me again, just grab your stuff and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan says, stressing the word. He meets Phil\u2019s gaze somehow, though he knows he must look far from ferocious, with his piggy eyes and damp cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t be around you. We need to just\u2026\u201d Dan threads shaky fingers through his hair. He needs a shower, badly. \u201cWe need to spend some time apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil sounds alarmed. \u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy,\u201d Dan says, shutting him up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m driving you crazy. Things are\u2026 different. You have a girlfriend, and I just don\u2019t fit into that. Let\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d Phil says, frantic. He\u2019s trying to reach for Dan\u2019s hand, but Dan won\u2019t let him take hold. \u201cDan, we can get past this-\u201d</p><p>Dan shakes his head. \u201cI have to get to work,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve skipped two shifts already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can come in later.\u201d</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes, begging. \u201cPlease, Phil,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Phil reaches the top of the hill, he\u2019s out of breath. He ran some of the way, and when he couldn\u2019t keep it up, slowed to a sort-of half jog. He spotted Amanda sat on the bench from the bottom of the hill, her thick curls buffeting about in the strong wind. She\u2019s facing away from him, so thankfully doesn\u2019t notice him puffing as he climbs the steep incline towards her.</p><p>At last he reaches her, and immediately begins apologising \u2013 he\u2019s almost an hour late to meet her here. She regards him a little worriedly, her big doe eyes round as she takes him in. She\u2019s wearing gold eyeshadow, making the chocolate-brown of her irises seem even richer.</p><p>\u201c\u2026so so sorry, I just got caught up, and then we sort of got in a fight, and-\u201d</p><p>Amanda holds up her hand to quiet him, alarmed. \u201cFight? Who did you fight with?\u201d</p><p>Phil flops down beside Amanda on the bench, unable to fight for breath standing upright any longer. \u201cDan,\u201d he says. \u201cI was at Dan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Amanda says. She lowers her hand, studying her pink fingernails. \u201cI thought you went home last night.\u201d</p><p>Yesterday evening, Phil had been at Amanda\u2019s house, helping her transport the enormous painting he\u2019d done of her into her bedroom. Her mum wasn\u2019t there, but her younger brothers, Jake and Aidan, had been. At nine and eleven, they were gleeful at having something to tease their sister about:</p><p><i>\u201cIs this your new boyfriend?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cDid he paint this picture of you?\u201d </i></p><p><i>\u201cIs it cos he lurrves you?\u201d</i></p><p>Phil had endured it with a smile, but their constant presence had not left a great deal of opportunity for him and Amanda to be alone.</p><p><i>\u201cWho looks after them when you and your mum aren\u2019t here?\u201d</i> Phil had asked, furtively, whilst Amanda was cooking the boys\u2019 dinner.</p><p><i>\u201cNobody,\u201d</i> Amanda replied. <i>\u201cSo I\u2019m pretty much always here.\u201d</i></p><p>Distracted as she was by her siblings, Phil spent a lot of the evening sat on Amanda\u2019s sofa, halfway through a Mario Kart race that Jake and Aidan had been too excitable to finish, his mind wandering to things he\u2019d been trying not to think about. Dan. Prom. The fight.</p><p>So, just as the boys were getting into their pyjamas, Phil decided he\u2019d head home. Amanda had her hands full, and despite trying to help her, Phil clearly was only getting in the way. She apologised about it, said they could meet up the next morning at the viewpoint up the hill by the park. Phil kissed her goodbye - on the cheek, her brothers were watching \u2013 and started to walk home. Then, he caught sight of the bus into town idling at the stop. Until that moment, he\u2019d been lying to himself that Dan would be more sensible than hanging out at Ozone for the past three days instead of coming into work or school. But seeing the bus just sat there, as if waiting for him to climb on, Phil couldn\u2019t keep up the pretence. He\u2019d jumped on straight away, barged into the club and found Dan off his face, snogging some creepy sound guy. He\u2019d managed to drag him home to stay over, after a lot of persuading and an almost-fight.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Phil replies, stretching the truth just a tad. \u201cDan\u2026 came over. After I left yours. This morning I\u2026 went round his for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Amanda nods in a way that screams \u2018bullshit\u2019. \u201cI thought he was pissed at you?\u201d</p><p>Phil shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s an angry guy.\u201d He settles back into the bench, eyes glazing as he recalls some of this anger. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen his face though, Jesus. Half black and blue from the fight. I still think Hardy got off worse, but I bet Dan\u2019s gonna be wearing that shiner for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Amanda says. \u201cSounds awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil says, sighing. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he stayed at yours last night?\u201d</p><p>Phil turns to her. He feels a quick rush of guilt, but it recedes soon after. \u201cYeah. He was\u2026 upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea why?\u201d</p><p>Phil gnaws his lip. \u201cBecause of the fight, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Amanda\u2019s following sigh is deep, as if she\u2019s summoned it from a well of despair. \u201cPhil, we need to have a chat.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is just the same as his mum\u2019s was, when she explained that she couldn\u2019t afford to send Phil to art lessons anymore, and that he\u2019d just have to watch online videos, or read books at the library, and teach himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Phil asks, though his heart pounds.</p><p>Amanda sighs again, looking out at the view in front of her. From this spot, high on a hill, at the fringe of an ugly, usually empty car park, the whole of the town is visible. From such a high vantage point, it\u2019s worryingly easy to see the stark difference between the upper side and the lower, sliced as they are by the railway down the middle. On the lower side, Phil\u2019s side, the houses are crushed together, mostly semi-detached, with a few grey blocks of estate flats placed here and there. I\u2019s all residential, pretty much, apart from the odd off-licence lurking ominously on a street corner, it\u2019s neon \u201924-hour\u2019 sign buzzing faintly.</p><p>The other side is quite literally greener, as the gardens of the wealthier people\u2019s houses sprawl, covered in pretty flowers and big ponds. The houses are way up on the furthest reaches of the town, as far from the ugly side as they can get, and the middle is full of neat, modern offices, streets of clothes shops and caf\u00e9s, and of course the big fountain in the midst of it all, right by where Ozone is hidden, half-underground. As Amanda observes all of this, Phil wonders what she must think of it. She detests it, probably. Or maybe just longs to hop across that train track for good.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you like me, Phil?\u201d</p><p>He turns to her, dumbfounded. For most, even just to glimpse her from afar would be enough of an answer to that question. \u201cUh\u2026 lots of reasons.\u201d</p><p>She turns to him. She looks worn out, her pretty features drooping. \u201cNo, honestly. I want you to tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Baffled, Phil\u2019s mind begins to reel, collecting all the reasons. He can\u2019t imagine Amanda is asking because of a hidden insecurity \u2013 she must be well aware of how much she is wanted by every female-liking person that catches a whiff of her knock-off perfume.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re funny,\u201d Phil says. \u201cYou\u2019re really quite sharp, and sarcastic \u2013 it surprised me at first.\u201d</p><p>She nods, still with that worn-out look masking her face. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd um, you\u2019re gorgeous obviously,\u201d Phil says, blushing. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it. Your hair, and your eyes. And the way you smile - glowing. It\u2019s like you\u2019re three steps ahead of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me sound like a dick,\u201d Amanda says, but she\u2019s smiling now, sort of. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find you just\u2026 super interesting,\u201d Phil confesses. He looks at his hands. \u201cThe life you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. You wanted this impossible thing - to be with the Elite despite your background. And you didn\u2019t let anything stop you. You fought for it.\u201d Phil is quiet for a moment, pensive. The wind sweeps one of Amanda\u2019s curls across his cheek. \u201cYou don\u2019t even really get on with the Elite people. But being one of them\u2026 it\u2019s how you cope. It\u2019s like by hiding out with them, pretending to be something you aren\u2019t, you\u2019re escaping everything else.\u201d He glances at her worriedly. \u201cI might be getting this all wrong, feel free to sock me if I\u2019m being a twat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Amanda says, shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s bang on, actually. I can\u2019t face my real life for too long, so I go hang out with a bunch of brain-dead morons, tag along to the parties they go to, pretend I\u2019m not\u2026 me.\u201d</p><p>Phil nods. \u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating. I admire your courage to do that every day. It must be so hard to keep it up.\u201d</p><p>Amanda is staring at him again. She looks as if she\u2019s waiting for something to click in Phil\u2019s mind. Phil just cocks his head to one side, totally in the dark. One last time, she heaves a sigh, then brings her hands up to untwist the earring from her left ear. Immediately, Phil is alarmed, and can only sit, wide-eyed, as she untwists the other, too. She holds them out to him in her tiny, pale hand. They look big, dark in her palm. Two blackcurrants in a pool of milk.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me, Phil,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course I do-\u201d</p><p>She places her other hand, the one not cupping the earrings, on his shoulder. As she leans in, her expression is kind, if a little condescending. \u201cNo. I want you to try and get this for yourself, Phil. I think you need to be the one to realise it, or you won\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d Phil can feel the panic welling up. It\u2019s as if he can feel her slipping through his fingers. Surely there must be some way to hold on to her. He\u2019s already won her once, he can do it again. \u201cI asked you to Prom because I like you, because I want to be with you, because you deserve-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I deserve better,\u201d Amanda finishes. \u201cBecause seedy guys are treating me like a piece of ass. Because I don\u2019t see that I\u2019m more than where I come from. Because you want to draw me, to show me that I\u2019m beautiful. To give me fancy things, so I can feel I\u2019m worth them. You want to hold me and kiss me and tell me that I\u2019m precious, and that I\u2019m safe, and that I\u2019m the most important thing to you, even if I don\u2019t matter to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s eyes are watery. He\u2019s so scared of what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s sliced that brown-eyed gaze straight through his forehead, into his soft, mushy mind. </p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>Amanda smiles. It\u2019s a gorgeous, radiant smile. She looks down into her hand, where the two black pearls lay, still. \u201cThese aren\u2019t meant for me, Phil. They belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>It takes Phil a moment, and then the penny drops. It drops like a stone into his gut, sending bubbles of hysterical laughter up his gullet, out of his throat. \u201cAre you talking about Dan?\u201d He asks, voice high. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not- I\u2019m not-\u201d</p><p>Amanda reaches out, and Phil doesn\u2019t understand why until he feels her sweep away a tear from his cheek. \u201cIt was Dan that you took to Prom, Phil.\u201d Something about her tone is so sure, so unwaveringly honest, that Phil doesn\u2019t try to contradict her. \u201cIt was him you bought the earrings for. It\u2019s him you\u2019re worried about, him you\u2019d fight off a thousand dickheads for. It\u2019s him you want, that you think deserves the world, that you think should be with you. It\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d <i>understand</i>, Phil wants to say. He presses a hand to his forehead, his cheek. He feels warm, despite the wintry chill. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to know what I think?\u201d Amanda asks. She takes hold of his hand, bringing it away from his face, clasping it. \u201cI think you have a huge well of kindness inside of you. I think you\u2019ve stored it up over years. You were waiting for the right person to give it to. And then you met that person, but he was stubborn, and he was defensive, and he wouldn\u2019t accept it. That\u2019s how he is. Fences built up sky high, all around him. So your well, it just kept building up. So much you were bursting with all this untapped, raw love and affection, all of it for him.\u201d </p><p>Amanda pauses. Phil feels his lungs growing tighter, as if he\u2019s climbing the hill again, stuck ascending it forever. He waits, struggling for air, for what she\u2019ll say next.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you saw me,\u201d Amanda says with a soft smile. \u201cAnd I am Dan. In so many ways. We grew up the same. We have the same attitude. We bury our shame in men that abuse us. We even look similar. Our hair. Our eyes. So you convinced yourself that it was me you wanted. That out of nowhere, I was the one for you. You didn\u2019t let yourself think it was Dan, not ever, because of those fences he has, keeping you away.\u201d She squeezes his hand. \u201cDo you think I might be right?\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s mind is reeling. It\u2019s a ferris wheel, going too fast, and rocking violently in a thunderstorm. The bolts and screws that keep it together are threatening to burst from their grooves. It\u2019s all about to come crashing down. Everything he\u2019s been so sure of, all that\u2019s been driving him for months. He looks at Amanda, tortured. Her smile is still in place. A film star smile, truly. As beautiful as looking straight at a burning, bright star. </p><p>But even though it is dazzling to behold her, windswept and as totally beguiling as she has ever been, deep in his soul, Phil knows. He\u2019s seen a better smile, one that cuts a dimple into a rounded cheek. He\u2019s seen browner eyes, that leak gold and caramel and ochre. He\u2019s felt softer curls against his fingers. He\u2019s heard a rarer, sweeter laugh, and a deeper, richer voice. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so sorry,\u201d Phil says. It\u2019s utterly gut-wrenching, to know, in his aching, guilty soul, that she is right. \u201cI\u2019ve strung you along all this time\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to, Phil,\u201d Amanda says softly. She presses the earrings into his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I doubt you even know how much you\u2019ve helped me, despite this. You reminded me that people like you exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like me,\u201d Phil scoffs. He shakes his head, eyes stinging. \u201cIdiots that blunder into things they\u2019ve half thought about. People that hurt everyone around them because they\u2019re too pig-headed to see two feet in front of their nose.\u201d</p><p>Amanda squeezes his hand. \u201cPeople that can fall so deeply, excruciatingly in love with someone that they\u2019re blind from it. If the past few days have been any glimpse of how generous, and sweet, and kind you\u2019d be with the person you love\u2026\u201d She shakes her head, eyebrows raised. \u201cDan\u2019s a heck of a lucky guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can be okay with this,\u201d Phil sniffs, trying to ignore the heavy blush fizzing in his cheeks. \u201cWhen you said yes to Prom with me you lost everything. All the work you put in, getting in with the Elites\u2026 it\u2019s all for nothing. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you did me a favour, getting me out of that nightmare.\u201d Amanda smiles, that mischievous glimmer in her gold shadowed eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for me to stand on my own two feet for a while. Don\u2019t worry about me, okay? You\u2019ve got enough to deal with.\u201d She squeezes his hand a final time, and lets go. \u201cI\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>*</p><p>Dan\u2019s on the doghouse shift, because Louise is pissed at him for skipping work the past few days. She\u2019d had to cover for him when Hardy\u2019s dad came in, apparently, lying that he was ill with flu. The only reason Dan isn\u2019t fired, according to Louise, is because in all the years Dan\u2019s worked here, and all the extra shifts he\u2019s taken on, he\u2019s never before missed work.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you mop the floor tonight too,\u201d Louise shouts to Dan from the kitchen.</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes in secret. \u201cYeah, I will.\u201d</p><p>Privately, Dan suspects that Louise is a little extra pissed off because he refused to explain to her what the actual reason was for his\u00a0 absence. Being the gossip hound she is, Louise took one look at Dan\u2019s bruised face, his split lip, and along with the account she\u2019d gotten from PJ about the incident at Prom (PJ was not there of course, being younger than Dan, but his knowledge was still plentiful as far as Dan can tell thanks to the St Anthony rumour mill), sniffed a scandal. Dan just answered her questions with vague deflections, not wanting to go into the whole drama of it quite yet. She\u2019ll get it out of him eventually, she always does.</p><p>It\u2019s Friday, so the caf\u00e9 is rammed, made worse by the fact that seemingly half of St Anthony\u2019s student body is in here, because half term is next week, and the school decided to make today an inset day as a special treat. Dan hasn\u2019t had a spare minute to clean the milk jugs properly, let alone have a fag break. He\u2019s been on his feet since 10am, and it\u2019s getting dark outside. The windows are opaque with condensation from the non-stop chatter of the students, not to mention the hot coffees Dan keeps churning out for them.</p><p>In a way, Dan is glad he hasn\u2019t had a moment to breathe, because he\u2019s barely holding himself together after the events of the past few days. If he lets his mind wander from the temperature of the milk he\u2019s frothing, or which table has to be cleared next, he\u2019ll start to think of Phil, and what Dan had told him about needing to be apart, and then his heart will ache at the idea of returning to a solitary life, watching Phil hold Amanda\u2019s hand down the school hallway every day. Dan knocks over the pot of demerara sugar packets as he hands a customer a takeaway flat white. The packets spill onto the floor behind the counter, and Dan curses, crouching down to start picking them up. As he does, he hears the annoying tinkle of the bell as yet another person enters.</p><p>\u201cLouise!\u201d He calls. \u201cCould you come serve this customer, please?\u201d</p><p>She bustles out, irritated no doubt because she prefers to be a \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 kind of manager.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, stepping around Dan\u2019s huddled form as she approaches the till. Dan glances up in time to watch as a smile spreads onto her face. \u201cPhil, what can I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dan?\u201d Phil\u2019s voice is urgent. </p><p>Dan freezes at the sound of him. Something about Phil\u2019s energy must be a warning sign for Louise, because she sneaks a subtle look down at Dan before responding. Dan shakes his head slowly, begging her to stay silent.</p><p>\u201cOh, um,\u201d Louise says, looking back to Phil. Dan shuffles closer to the wall of the counter, trying not to make a sound. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a while\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he come into work today?\u201d Phil asks in that same pressing voice. \u201cHe said he was going to. I need to see him, I have to tell him\u2026\u201d</p><p>Dan waits, but he doesn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cI could take a message for him?\u201d Louise\u2019s voice is gentle. Dan is so grateful for her, in this moment.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell him\u2026\u201d A crack runs through Phil\u2019s words, as though they\u2019re about to splinter apart. \u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m too late, and it\u2019s my fault, and I\u2019m sorry. And tell him I was blind, and that he\u2019s perfect, and I\u2019ve never actually wanted anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Dan stands up. Phil is wearing a black beanie hat with a Gengar on it, his glasses are beginning to fog up, and he\u2019s got a light haze of stubble on his jaw. His mouth opens a little when he sees Dan, obviously stunned by his sudden appearance. Louise takes a slow step backwards, a wildly excited glint in her eye at the prospect of imminent drama.</p><p>Dan\u2019s heart is thrumming at the base of his throat. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>For a seemingly endless few seconds, all Phil does is stare, and Dan wonders if he misheard. </p><p>\u201cDan, I- I couldn\u2019t see it. I wouldn\u2019t let myself.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the kind of vague, irritatingly ambiguous answer that Dan just doesn\u2019t have the patience for right now. The frustration - from this conversation, from the slew of dead ends he\u2019s been facing, from his boring life, from the constant ache in his bruised face - finally boils over. He huffs, rolling his eyes, swiping the pot of sugar up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d He slams the pot of sugar back in its place with a thwack, and pushes through the door at his rear into the kitchen.</p><p>Phil, of course, follows him straight in. \u201cIt makes sense now,\u201d he\u2019s saying, bizarrely. Dan takes him by the arm and drags him out of the kitchen, annoyed. \u201cI think part of me woke up to it when I kissed you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s speaking too loudly, Dan realises a fraction too late. The immediate vicinity of student-packed tables turn in surprise, ears pricking at the words leaving Phil\u2019s mouth. Great, Dan thinks, just what he needs. More fuel for the St Anthony\u2019s gossip train about his extra-curricular activities. He drops Phil\u2019s arm like it\u2019s burning, and shoots him a harsh glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d Dan hisses. \u201cI thought I told you not to come in here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan, please listen,\u201d Phil begs. Dan just ignores him, swiping a nearby tray and beginning to angrily load dirty cups onto it from one of the tables of onlookers. The crockery clatters and knocks together, maybe chipping, but Dan can\u2019t find it in himself to care. Phil rambles on, voice raising over the noise. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining myself very well, my mind\u2019s all floopy. Amanda said it so well-\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her name, Dan drops the tray. A lot of it survives, but a teapot smashes into pieces, which ricochet across the floor. Some of the onlookers clap and jeer, not helping Dan\u2019s growing feelings of vexation. Immediately Phil is on his knees, scrambling to collect the pieces. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Dan snaps, dropping to his knees as well. He bats Phil\u2019s hands away from the broken pieces. \u201cYou\u2019ll slice your hand open, let me do it.\u201d</p><p>Phil watches without argument as Dan gathers the larger bits and puts them carefully on the tray. Louise approaches, brandishing a dustpan and brush. She inclines her head, telling them both without words to move aside. As Dan stands, Phil steps towards him, catching hold of his wrists. Dan backs up, but Phil just moves with him, holding tight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it so that you\u2019ll understand,\u201d Phil says. There\u2019s a desperation so deep, so strong in his face that Dan stops trying. He\u2019s going to have to endure, to listen to whatever ridiculous speech Phil is about to give. He sighs, trying uselessly to steel himself for the cut of the jagged knife in Phil\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can find the right words. So here.\u201d</p><p>At first, Dan is baffled. Phil is digging into his jeans pocket, and then he tucks something into Dan\u2019s fist. Slowly, Dan\u2019s eyes lower to it, and he unfurls his fingers. There, laid in the centre of his palm, are two black pearls, fixed onto thin silver stems.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Dan says, locked on the earrings. \u201cDid she not want them?\u201d</p><p>Phil shakes his head. He smells so dreamy, this close. Like fresh rainwater, sweetened with a splash of syrup. \u201cThey\u2019re yours, Dan. They were always yours.\u201d</p><p>Dan swallows around a lump of coal lodged in his throat. His heart is doing that strange thrumming again; this time he can feel it right down in his fingertips. </p><p>\u201cYou bought these for Amanda,\u201d Dan says, though his voice wobbles, like he\u2019s not sure of that truth.</p><p>Phil smiles very slightly. \u201cI thought so, too. But I was kidding myself, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d He plucks one of the earrings and slips the back off. He\u2019s gentle, almost reverent, as he reaches up, pressing it into Dan\u2019s ear. When it\u2019s fastened, Dan is utterly still, too bemused to move an inch. Phil leans back, a breath of laughter escaping. \u201cAnyone with half a brain could see. These are made for you.\u201d</p><p>Something hot and stinging smarts Dan\u2019s eyes, the back of his nose. \u201cWhat- what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m in love with my best friend,\u201d Phil says. He\u2019s reaching past Dan\u2019s cheek, to fix the other earring in place. \u201cI\u2019m saying I always have been.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s vaguely aware of an audience, watching what has become quite the scene, silently gawping at a confession Dan could not have predicted if he tried.

It\u2019s such a sweet, gentle kiss that Dan thinks he might die from the softness. Instead he falls in, headfirst, helpless to surrender to the weighty swell of watery affection that swamps around him, drowning him in the warm euphoria of his deepest desire.</p><p><b>(Chapter 11 coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

The barren path he trudges down is frosted with a sheet of white, thinner than a sleeve of cr&ecirc;pe paper. The route home from Phil&rsquo;s winds around the town&rsquo;s park - a generous term for the patch of grass near a Primary school, vaguely upkept by an elderly man in a jumpsuit occasionally seen pulling weeds. The cold, endless winter has left the park dry and brown, a perfect reflection of Dan&rsquo;s mood. There&rsquo;s a dilapidated children&rsquo;s playground at one end of the park, surrounded by a chain link fence. Inside, the metal swings and climbing frames are rusted to the point of danger. It&rsquo;s doubtful that any sound-minded parents allow their kids to brave them anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>As he walks by the skate park at the other end, Dan slows a little, surveying what&rsquo;s become of it. When he was around seven or eight, Dan would sneak out here to watch Ricky skate with his friends. He&rsquo;d loiter at the edge of the concrete, pretending to be just passing by. Ricky would yell at him to go home, tell him he was too young to be there and to stop pestering him. Dan recalls the sneer on his brother&rsquo;s face so clearly, even now. At twelve years old, Ricky was just as mean, just as angry as he is today. It didn&rsquo;t deter Dan, back then. As a child, all Dan wanted was to be his older brother, to emulate him, or at least to befriend him. </p><p>A thick pulse of sudden wind sweeps over Dan, and he shivers. Without a jacket, the early morning is almost unbearably cold. He shoves his hands as deeply as he can into his shallow jean pockets, and walks on.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than dwell on what awaits him at home, Dan imagines he is back in Phil&rsquo;s bed, weighted by his soft blue-green duvet, Phil&rsquo;s silky hair tickling his cheek. Phil gets too close in the night. He doesn&rsquo;t mean to, but he&rsquo;s drawn to warmth unconsciously, like a cat sprawling in a sunbeam. Dan had woken up early to the press of his body, to the sighs of his sleep, long fingers resting on his abdomen. He couldn&rsquo;t stand the touch of him, in the light of day. He&rsquo;d stolen out of Phil&rsquo;s bedroom before even Mrs Lester was roused. He wishes he had somewhere else to return to, but having been kicked out of Ozone, and having pissed off Sam and Ben, Dan is officially out of options. He knew he&rsquo;d have to face Ricky eventually, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less horrific of a reality.</p><p>The walk between his and Phil&rsquo;s house is maybe ten minutes at the most, but despite his pathetic attempt to dawdle and drag it out, the cold spurs him onwards, and he arrives far too soon. The light is on in Ricky&rsquo;s bedroom window; he&rsquo;ll likely be getting ready for work. Dan glances at Ricky&rsquo;s car, parked in the driveway still, silent, unknowingly the root of all this trouble. Dan takes a deep breath, then lets himself in the front door.</p><p>It takes under a minute for Ricky to appear at the top of the stairs, having heard the door open no doubt. His shirt is half buttoned, and his knee high black socks are the only clothing on his bare shins. At least he&rsquo;s wearing boxers.</p><p>&ldquo;You little shit,&rdquo; Ricky hisses, then thunders down the stairs. Dan swallows hard, trying to remain composed as he approaches. &ldquo;Think you can just steal my fucking car? Think I wouldn&rsquo;t notice?&rdquo;</p><p>His hands are already balled into fists.</p><p>&ldquo;Brought it back, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p><p>Ricky grabs him by the shirt and shoves him hard against the door, growling. Dan squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for the inevitable blow. It doesn&rsquo;t come straight away. Seconds pass, and still no impact, so Dan opens one eye, meeting Ricky&rsquo;s glare.</p><p>His brother is breathing hard, chest puffing out. His fist has fallen to his side, though he still has ahold of Dan by the shirt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all&hellip;&rdquo; Ricky says, then gestures to Dan&rsquo;s cheek, making him flinch. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with your face?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan doesn&rsquo;t answer. Whatever he says would make no difference anyway. He wishes Ricky would just get it over with, land his kicks or punches so they can move on. Once he gets his anger out, Ricky&rsquo;s at least a little easier to deal with. To Dan&rsquo;s astonishment, Ricky releases him instead. He takes a step back, surveying Dan carefully. </p><p>&ldquo;Someone do that to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Again, Dan doesn&rsquo;t dare reply, but his left shoulder comes up in a small shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fuck&rsquo;s it matter, Ricky?&rdquo; Dan croaks out. &ldquo;You pissed off someone got there first?&rdquo;</p><p>Ricky&rsquo;s teeth clench. &ldquo;Mum said some kid came round looking for you. Lanky, black hair. Glasses. Was it him?&rdquo;</p><p>Dan struggles to swallow the burst of hysterical laughter that surges up. The idea of Phil managing to injure anything larger than the moths he occasionally has to swat for Dan is bonkers.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan says, choosing not to bother trying to explain this.</p><p>&ldquo;If it was, I&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; Ricky says, absurdly. </p><p>Dan can&rsquo;t understand his brother&rsquo;s logic &ndash; it&rsquo;s apparently fine if Dan&rsquo;s injuries are caused by Ricky himself, but if it&rsquo;s anyone outside the family, that&rsquo;s obviously outrageous. But Dan doesn&rsquo;t get a chance to probe Ricky for whatever half-witted explanation he might give, because at that moment, there&rsquo;s a knock on the other side of the door. Dan feels the three pounds vibrate down his back.</p><p>Ricky stares, deep lines creasing his Neanderthal forehead as he thinks about what to do. He grabs Dan&rsquo;s arm and yanks him away from the door, then wrenches it open. Dan wonders if he&rsquo;s forgotten he&rsquo;s not dressed. At the sight of Phil, standing ashen on his front step, Dan&rsquo;s blood runs cold. He stumbles forwards, attempting to push Ricky aside, but his brother is stocky, heavy-set. Dan&rsquo;s always been the twiglet, compared to him.</p><p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; Ricky says, drinking in the sight of Phil. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the nonce who was here the other day. Mum says you had a hand in stealing my car, an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan jumps in quickly. He has a hand hovering over Ricky&rsquo;s upper arm, primed to hold him back if he tries anything. &ldquo;No, that was all me. He&rsquo;s got nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; Phil says, his shoulders already slumping in relief at the sight of him. &ldquo;I woke up and you were gone. Are you alright-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oi, I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to you,&rdquo; Ricky says to Phil. He takes a step over the threshold, getting closer to him. &ldquo;Were you involved in this? Did you see him nick it?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil looks from Ricky to Dan, at a loss. &ldquo;I-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s hand makes contact with Ricky&rsquo;s shoulder and pulls hard, forcing him to turn. &ldquo;Ricky, it was me. All me. I stole your keys off the counter, I snuck out while you were in your room, I drove the car to Prom.&rdquo;</p><p>Ricky&rsquo;s eyes are fiery and dark. He opens his mouth to retort, to yell perhaps, but then Phil speaks.</p><p>&ldquo;But I made him,&rdquo; he says. Dan could throttle him. &ldquo;I asked him to take it for the night. I bribed him, actually.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil, shut up,&rdquo; Dan hisses.</p><p>Phil ignores him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault. If you wanna be pissed at anyone it should be me. Dan&rsquo;s been through enough.&rdquo;</p><p>This last comment is just strange enough to kill Dan&rsquo;s argument before it forms. Ricky is silent in the face of Phil&rsquo;s words. He&rsquo;s squinting at Phil, like he&rsquo;s trying to figure him out. Phil is dressed bizarrely, in black jogging bottoms, a Halloween jumper, and a galaxy printed jacket. He&rsquo;s obviously rolled straight out of bed. Even his shoelaces are untied. Did he honestly wake up, realise Dan was gone and run right after him?</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake, I don&rsquo;t have time for this,&rdquo; Ricky suddenly declares. </p><p>He turns from Phil, shoving past Dan back into the house. Dan holds his breath, staying perfectly still as he listens to Ricky&rsquo;s feet pounding up the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Did&hellip; did we get away with it?&rdquo; Phil asks into the silence Ricky left them standing in.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything to get away with,&rdquo; Dan replies, tetchy. &ldquo;That was really fucking stupid, trying to take the blame like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil just shrugs. It&rsquo;s infuriating, how lightly he&rsquo;s taking this. Dan&rsquo;s heart has only just ceased pounding. &ldquo;I was so worried when I woke up this morning and you were gone,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;I knew you had nowhere else to go but here, back to Ricky. I thought if I came and backed you up-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Phil!&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s through keeping a lid on the anger. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t fucking school! My brother isn&rsquo;t Hardy Jenns or Sam the sound tech. He&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo; He lifts up his shirt, exposing his left side, where a patch of raw, shiny pink skin is visible. &ldquo;You know what this is? It&rsquo;s from when I was nine, and I broke Ricky&rsquo;s CD Walkman by accident, so he picked up Dad&rsquo;s boiling hot coffee and threw it at me.&rdquo; Dan lets the shirt fall, then yanks his collar to one side, exposing his big floral tattoo. &ldquo;I got this done to cover up the scar from Ricky shoving me through a glass door when I was thirteen, right after Dad died, because I chickened out of speaking at the funeral.&rdquo; Dan sticks out his wrist, exposing more scars, more reminders. &ldquo;These are from fights, from him pushing me over, or into doors or walls, and just from being smacked about all my damn life.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan takes a breath, not able to meet Phil&rsquo;s eye.</p><p>&ldquo;I have more,&rdquo; Dan says, voice cracking. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fucking violent, Phil. You can&rsquo;t piss him off. I can&rsquo;t see you be hurt like that.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil moves closer, so Dan takes a step back. They&rsquo;re both inside now, which is terrifying in itself for Dan, because Ricky is still upstairs. Dan had done so well keeping Phil from his family until now. He never wanted them to know of his existence, never wanted Phil to so much as be a blip on Ricky&rsquo;s radar. Dan vaguely notices he&rsquo;s crying, just from pure overwhelm, but he still doesn&rsquo;t expect it when Phil&rsquo;s arms wrap around him. It takes a minute, but eventually he just cant be bothered to resist. Phil is a warm, calm safety blanket. He smells like cinnamon and sweets, and he&rsquo;s offering himself to Dan, now, when he needs that blanket most, so Dan just melts into it. Phil doesn&rsquo;t say a word, he just holds tight, letting Dan sniffle and dampen his jacket.</p><p>Eventually Dan pulls free, wiping his sodden face with his sleeve. &ldquo;You need to go,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;No, come on,&rdquo; Phil replies quickly. He reaches for Dan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You can come home with me again, just grab your stuff and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan says, stressing the word. He meets Phil&rsquo;s gaze somehow, though he knows he must look far from ferocious, with his piggy eyes and damp cheeks. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be around you. We need to just&hellip;&rdquo; Dan threads shaky fingers through his hair. He needs a shower, badly. &ldquo;We need to spend some time apart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Phil sounds alarmed. &ldquo;But-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re driving me crazy,&rdquo; Dan says, shutting him up. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m driving you crazy. Things are&hellip; different. You have a girlfriend, and I just don&rsquo;t fit into that. Let&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re my best friend,&rdquo; Phil says, frantic. He&rsquo;s trying to reach for Dan&rsquo;s hand, but Dan won&rsquo;t let him take hold. &ldquo;Dan, we can get past this-&rdquo;</p><p>Dan shakes his head. &ldquo;I have to get to work,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve skipped two shifts already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can come in later.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan lifts his eyes, begging. &ldquo;Please, Phil,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>By the time Phil reaches the top of the hill, he&rsquo;s out of breath. He ran some of the way, and when he couldn&rsquo;t keep it up, slowed to a sort-of half jog. He spotted Amanda sat on the bench from the bottom of the hill, her thick curls buffeting about in the strong wind. She&rsquo;s facing away from him, so thankfully doesn&rsquo;t notice him puffing as he climbs the steep incline towards her.</p><p>At last he reaches her, and immediately begins apologising &ndash; he&rsquo;s almost an hour late to meet her here. She regards him a little worriedly, her big doe eyes round as she takes him in. She&rsquo;s wearing gold eyeshadow, making the chocolate-brown of her irises seem even richer.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;so so sorry, I just got caught up, and then we sort of got in a fight, and-&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda holds up her hand to quiet him, alarmed. &ldquo;Fight? Who did you fight with?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil flops down beside Amanda on the bench, unable to fight for breath standing upright any longer. &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was at Dan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Amanda says. She lowers her hand, studying her pink fingernails. &ldquo;I thought you went home last night.&rdquo;</p><p>Yesterday evening, Phil had been at Amanda&rsquo;s house, helping her transport the enormous painting he&rsquo;d done of her into her bedroom. Her mum wasn&rsquo;t there, but her younger brothers, Jake and Aidan, had been. At nine and eleven, they were gleeful at having something to tease their sister about:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Is this your new boyfriend?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Did he paint this picture of you?&rdquo; </i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is it cos he lurrves you?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Phil had endured it with a smile, but their constant presence had not left a great deal of opportunity for him and Amanda to be alone.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Who looks after them when you and your mum aren&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</i> Phil had asked, furtively, whilst Amanda was cooking the boys&rsquo; dinner.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo;</i> Amanda replied. <i>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m pretty much always here.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Distracted as she was by her siblings, Phil spent a lot of the evening sat on Amanda&rsquo;s sofa, halfway through a Mario Kart race that Jake and Aidan had been too excitable to finish, his mind wandering to things he&rsquo;d been trying not to think about. Dan. Prom. The fight.</p><p>So, just as the boys were getting into their pyjamas, Phil decided he&rsquo;d head home. Amanda had her hands full, and despite trying to help her, Phil clearly was only getting in the way. She apologised about it, said they could meet up the next morning at the viewpoint up the hill by the park. Phil kissed her goodbye - on the cheek, her brothers were watching &ndash; and started to walk home. Then, he caught sight of the bus into town idling at the stop. Until that moment, he&rsquo;d been lying to himself that Dan would be more sensible than hanging out at Ozone for the past three days instead of coming into work or school. But seeing the bus just sat there, as if waiting for him to climb on, Phil couldn&rsquo;t keep up the pretence. He&rsquo;d jumped on straight away, barged into the club and found Dan off his face, snogging some creepy sound guy. He&rsquo;d managed to drag him home to stay over, after a lot of persuading and an almost-fight.</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Phil replies, stretching the truth just a tad. &ldquo;Dan&hellip; came over. After I left yours. This morning I&hellip; went round his for a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda nods in a way that screams &lsquo;bullshit&rsquo;. &ldquo;I thought he was pissed at you?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shrugs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an angry guy.&rdquo; He settles back into the bench, eyes glazing as he recalls some of this anger. &ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve seen his face though, Jesus. Half black and blue from the fight. I still think Hardy got off worse, but I bet Dan&rsquo;s gonna be wearing that shiner for a while.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Amanda says. &ldquo;Sounds awful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Phil says, sighing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really worried about him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, he stayed at yours last night?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil turns to her. He feels a quick rush of guilt, but it recedes soon after. &ldquo;Yeah. He was&hellip; upset.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea why?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil gnaws his lip. &ldquo;Because of the fight, I guess.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda&rsquo;s following sigh is deep, as if she&rsquo;s summoned it from a well of despair. &ldquo;Phil, we need to have a chat.&rdquo;</p><p>Her tone is just the same as his mum&rsquo;s was, when she explained that she couldn&rsquo;t afford to send Phil to art lessons anymore, and that he&rsquo;d just have to watch online videos, or read books at the library, and teach himself.</p><p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; Phil asks, though his heart pounds.</p><p>Amanda sighs again, looking out at the view in front of her. From this spot, high on a hill, at the fringe of an ugly, usually empty car park, the whole of the town is visible. From such a high vantage point, it&rsquo;s worryingly easy to see the stark difference between the upper side and the lower, sliced as they are by the railway down the middle. On the lower side, Phil&rsquo;s side, the houses are crushed together, mostly semi-detached, with a few grey blocks of estate flats placed here and there. I&rsquo;s all residential, pretty much, apart from the odd off-licence lurking ominously on a street corner, it&rsquo;s neon &rsquo;24-hour&rsquo; sign buzzing faintly.</p><p>The other side is quite literally greener, as the gardens of the wealthier people&rsquo;s houses sprawl, covered in pretty flowers and big ponds. The houses are way up on the furthest reaches of the town, as far from the ugly side as they can get, and the middle is full of neat, modern offices, streets of clothes shops and caf&eacute;s, and of course the big fountain in the midst of it all, right by where Ozone is hidden, half-underground. As Amanda observes all of this, Phil wonders what she must think of it. She detests it, probably. Or maybe just longs to hop across that train track for good.</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you like me, Phil?&rdquo;</p><p>He turns to her, dumbfounded. For most, even just to glimpse her from afar would be enough of an answer to that question. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; lots of reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>She turns to him. She looks worn out, her pretty features drooping. &ldquo;No, honestly. I want you to tell me why.&rdquo;</p><p>Baffled, Phil&rsquo;s mind begins to reel, collecting all the reasons. He can&rsquo;t imagine Amanda is asking because of a hidden insecurity &ndash; she must be well aware of how much she is wanted by every female-liking person that catches a whiff of her knock-off perfume.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re funny,&rdquo; Phil says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really quite sharp, and sarcastic &ndash; it surprised me at first.&rdquo;</p><p>She nods, still with that worn-out look masking her face. &ldquo;Uh huh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And um, you&rsquo;re gorgeous obviously,&rdquo; Phil says, blushing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought it. Your hair, and your eyes. And the way you smile - glowing. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re three steps ahead of everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making me sound like a dick,&rdquo; Amanda says, but she&rsquo;s smiling now, sort of. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I find you just&hellip; super interesting,&rdquo; Phil confesses. He looks at his hands. &ldquo;The life you&rsquo;ve chosen for yourself. You wanted this impossible thing - to be with the Elite despite your background. And you didn&rsquo;t let anything stop you. You fought for it.&rdquo; Phil is quiet for a moment, pensive. The wind sweeps one of Amanda&rsquo;s curls across his cheek. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even really get on with the Elite people. But being one of them&hellip; it&rsquo;s how you cope. It&rsquo;s like by hiding out with them, pretending to be something you aren&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re escaping everything else.&rdquo; He glances at her worriedly. &ldquo;I might be getting this all wrong, feel free to sock me if I&rsquo;m being a twat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Amanda says, shrugging. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bang on, actually. I can&rsquo;t face my real life for too long, so I go hang out with a bunch of brain-dead morons, tag along to the parties they go to, pretend I&rsquo;m not&hellip; me.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil nods. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fascinating. I admire your courage to do that every day. It must be so hard to keep it up.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda is staring at him again. She looks as if she&rsquo;s waiting for something to click in Phil&rsquo;s mind. Phil just cocks his head to one side, totally in the dark. One last time, she heaves a sigh, then brings her hands up to untwist the earring from her left ear. Immediately, Phil is alarmed, and can only sit, wide-eyed, as she untwists the other, too. She holds them out to him in her tiny, pale hand. They look big, dark in her palm. Two blackcurrants in a pool of milk.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me, Phil,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>&ldquo;What? Of course I do-&rdquo;</p><p>She places her other hand, the one not cupping the earrings, on his shoulder. As she leans in, her expression is kind, if a little condescending. &ldquo;No. I want you to try and get this for yourself, Phil. I think you need to be the one to realise it, or you won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo; Phil can feel the panic welling up. It&rsquo;s as if he can feel her slipping through his fingers. Surely there must be some way to hold on to her. He&rsquo;s already won her once, he can do it again. &ldquo;I asked you to Prom because I like you, because I want to be with you, because you deserve-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I deserve better,&rdquo; Amanda finishes. &ldquo;Because seedy guys are treating me like a piece of ass. Because I don&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m more than where I come from. Because you want to draw me, to show me that I&rsquo;m beautiful. To give me fancy things, so I can feel I&rsquo;m worth them. You want to hold me and kiss me and tell me that I&rsquo;m precious, and that I&rsquo;m safe, and that I&rsquo;m the most important thing to you, even if I don&rsquo;t matter to anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s eyes are watery. He&rsquo;s so scared of what she&rsquo;s saying. It&rsquo;s as if she&rsquo;s sliced that brown-eyed gaze straight through his forehead, into his soft, mushy mind. </p><p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda smiles. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous, radiant smile. She looks down into her hand, where the two black pearls lay, still. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t meant for me, Phil. They belong to someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>It takes Phil a moment, and then the penny drops. It drops like a stone into his gut, sending bubbles of hysterical laughter up his gullet, out of his throat. &ldquo;Are you talking about Dan?&rdquo; He asks, voice high. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not- I&rsquo;m not-&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda reaches out, and Phil doesn&rsquo;t understand why until he feels her sweep away a tear from his cheek. &ldquo;It was Dan that you took to Prom, Phil.&rdquo; Something about her tone is so sure, so unwaveringly honest, that Phil doesn&rsquo;t try to contradict her. &ldquo;It was him you bought the earrings for. It&rsquo;s him you&rsquo;re worried about, him you&rsquo;d fight off a thousand dickheads for. It&rsquo;s him you want, that you think deserves the world, that you think should be with you. It&rsquo;s not me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; <i>understand</i>, Phil wants to say. He presses a hand to his forehead, his cheek. He feels warm, despite the wintry chill. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to know what I think?&rdquo; Amanda asks. She takes hold of his hand, bringing it away from his face, clasping it. &ldquo;I think you have a huge well of kindness inside of you. I think you&rsquo;ve stored it up over years. You were waiting for the right person to give it to. And then you met that person, but he was stubborn, and he was defensive, and he wouldn&rsquo;t accept it. That&rsquo;s how he is. Fences built up sky high, all around him. So your well, it just kept building up. So much you were bursting with all this untapped, raw love and affection, all of it for him.&rdquo; </p><p>Amanda pauses. Phil feels his lungs growing tighter, as if he&rsquo;s climbing the hill again, stuck ascending it forever. He waits, struggling for air, for what she&rsquo;ll say next.</p><p>&ldquo;And then you saw me,&rdquo; Amanda says with a soft smile. &ldquo;And I am Dan. In so many ways. We grew up the same. We have the same attitude. We bury our shame in men that abuse us. We even look similar. Our hair. Our eyes. So you convinced yourself that it was me you wanted. That out of nowhere, I was the one for you. You didn&rsquo;t let yourself think it was Dan, not ever, because of those fences he has, keeping you away.&rdquo; She squeezes his hand. &ldquo;Do you think I might be right?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s mind is reeling. It&rsquo;s a ferris wheel, going too fast, and rocking violently in a thunderstorm. The bolts and screws that keep it together are threatening to burst from their grooves. It&rsquo;s all about to come crashing down. Everything he&rsquo;s been so sure of, all that&rsquo;s been driving him for months. He looks at Amanda, tortured. Her smile is still in place. A film star smile, truly. As beautiful as looking straight at a burning, bright star. </p><p>But even though it is dazzling to behold her, windswept and as totally beguiling as she has ever been, deep in his soul, Phil knows. He&rsquo;s seen a better smile, one that cuts a dimple into a rounded cheek. He&rsquo;s seen browner eyes, that leak gold and caramel and ochre. He&rsquo;s felt softer curls against his fingers. He&rsquo;s heard a rarer, sweeter laugh, and a deeper, richer voice. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; so sorry,&rdquo; Phil says. It&rsquo;s utterly gut-wrenching, to know, in his aching, guilty soul, that she is right. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve strung you along all this time&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean to, Phil,&rdquo; Amanda says softly. She presses the earrings into his hand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. I doubt you even know how much you&rsquo;ve helped me, despite this. You reminded me that people like you exist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People like me,&rdquo; Phil scoffs. He shakes his head, eyes stinging. &ldquo;Idiots that blunder into things they&rsquo;ve half thought about. People that hurt everyone around them because they&rsquo;re too pig-headed to see two feet in front of their nose.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda squeezes his hand. &ldquo;People that can fall so deeply, excruciatingly in love with someone that they&rsquo;re blind from it. If the past few days have been any glimpse of how generous, and sweet, and kind you&rsquo;d be with the person you love&hellip;&rdquo; She shakes her head, eyebrows raised. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s a heck of a lucky guy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can be okay with this,&rdquo; Phil sniffs, trying to ignore the heavy blush fizzing in his cheeks. &ldquo;When you said yes to Prom with me you lost everything. All the work you put in, getting in with the Elites&hellip; it&rsquo;s all for nothing. Because of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey, you did me a favour, getting me out of that nightmare.&rdquo; Amanda smiles, that mischievous glimmer in her gold shadowed eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be good for me to stand on my own two feet for a while. Don&rsquo;t worry about me, okay? You&rsquo;ve got enough to deal with.&rdquo; She squeezes his hand a final time, and lets go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>*</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s on the doghouse shift, because Louise is pissed at him for skipping work the past few days. She&rsquo;d had to cover for him when Hardy&rsquo;s dad came in, apparently, lying that he was ill with flu. The only reason Dan isn&rsquo;t fired, according to Louise, is because in all the years Dan&rsquo;s worked here, and all the extra shifts he&rsquo;s taken on, he&rsquo;s never before missed work.</p><p>&ldquo;Make sure you mop the floor tonight too,&rdquo; Louise shouts to Dan from the kitchen.</p><p>Dan rolls his eyes in secret. &ldquo;Yeah, I will.&rdquo;</p><p>Privately, Dan suspects that Louise is a little extra pissed off because he refused to explain to her what the actual reason was for his&nbsp; absence. Being the gossip hound she is, Louise took one look at Dan&rsquo;s bruised face, his split lip, and along with the account she&rsquo;d gotten from PJ about the incident at Prom (PJ was not there of course, being younger than Dan, but his knowledge was still plentiful as far as Dan can tell thanks to the St Anthony rumour mill), sniffed a scandal. Dan just answered her questions with vague deflections, not wanting to go into the whole drama of it quite yet. She&rsquo;ll get it out of him eventually, she always does.</p><p>It&rsquo;s Friday, so the caf&eacute; is rammed, made worse by the fact that seemingly half of St Anthony&rsquo;s student body is in here, because half term is next week, and the school decided to make today an inset day as a special treat. Dan hasn&rsquo;t had a spare minute to clean the milk jugs properly, let alone have a fag break. He&rsquo;s been on his feet since 10am, and it&rsquo;s getting dark outside. The windows are opaque with condensation from the non-stop chatter of the students, not to mention the hot coffees Dan keeps churning out for them.</p><p>In a way, Dan is glad he hasn&rsquo;t had a moment to breathe, because he&rsquo;s barely holding himself together after the events of the past few days. If he lets his mind wander from the temperature of the milk he&rsquo;s frothing, or which table has to be cleared next, he&rsquo;ll start to think of Phil, and what Dan had told him about needing to be apart, and then his heart will ache at the idea of returning to a solitary life, watching Phil hold Amanda&rsquo;s hand down the school hallway every day. Dan knocks over the pot of demerara sugar packets as he hands a customer a takeaway flat white. The packets spill onto the floor behind the counter, and Dan curses, crouching down to start picking them up. As he does, he hears the annoying tinkle of the bell as yet another person enters.</p><p>&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; He calls. &ldquo;Could you come serve this customer, please?&rdquo;</p><p>She bustles out, irritated no doubt because she prefers to be a &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; kind of manager.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she says, stepping around Dan&rsquo;s huddled form as she approaches the till. Dan glances up in time to watch as a smile spreads onto her face. &ldquo;Phil, what can I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dan?&rdquo; Phil&rsquo;s voice is urgent. </p><p>Dan freezes at the sound of him. Something about Phil&rsquo;s energy must be a warning sign for Louise, because she sneaks a subtle look down at Dan before responding. Dan shakes his head slowly, begging her to stay silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, um,&rdquo; Louise says, looking back to Phil. Dan shuffles closer to the wall of the counter, trying not to make a sound. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him in a while&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he come into work today?&rdquo; Phil asks in that same pressing voice. &ldquo;He said he was going to. I need to see him, I have to tell him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Dan waits, but he doesn&rsquo;t finish the sentence.</p><p>&ldquo;I could take a message for him?&rdquo; Louise&rsquo;s voice is gentle. Dan is so grateful for her, in this moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Could you tell him&hellip;&rdquo; A crack runs through Phil&rsquo;s words, as though they&rsquo;re about to splinter apart. &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m too late, and it&rsquo;s my fault, and I&rsquo;m sorry. And tell him I was blind, and that he&rsquo;s perfect, and I&rsquo;ve never actually wanted anyone else.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan stands up. Phil is wearing a black beanie hat with a Gengar on it, his glasses are beginning to fog up, and he&rsquo;s got a light haze of stubble on his jaw. His mouth opens a little when he sees Dan, obviously stunned by his sudden appearance. Louise takes a slow step backwards, a wildly excited glint in her eye at the prospect of imminent drama.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s heart is thrumming at the base of his throat. &ldquo;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p><p>For a seemingly endless few seconds, all Phil does is stare, and Dan wonders if he misheard. </p><p>&ldquo;Dan, I- I couldn&rsquo;t see it. I wouldn&rsquo;t let myself.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s the kind of vague, irritatingly ambiguous answer that Dan just doesn&rsquo;t have the patience for right now. The frustration - from this conversation, from the slew of dead ends he&rsquo;s been facing, from his boring life, from the constant ache in his bruised face - finally boils over. He huffs, rolling his eyes, swiping the pot of sugar up from the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for this.&rdquo; He slams the pot of sugar back in its place with a thwack, and pushes through the door at his rear into the kitchen.</p><p>Phil, of course, follows him straight in. &ldquo;It makes sense now,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s saying, bizarrely. Dan takes him by the arm and drags him out of the kitchen, annoyed. &ldquo;I think part of me woke up to it when I kissed you.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s speaking too loudly, Dan realises a fraction too late. The immediate vicinity of student-packed tables turn in surprise, ears pricking at the words leaving Phil&rsquo;s mouth. Great, Dan thinks, just what he needs. More fuel for the St Anthony&rsquo;s gossip train about his extra-curricular activities. He drops Phil&rsquo;s arm like it&rsquo;s burning, and shoots him a harsh glare.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you on about?&rdquo; Dan hisses. &ldquo;I thought I told you not to come in here today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dan, please listen,&rdquo; Phil begs. Dan just ignores him, swiping a nearby tray and beginning to angrily load dirty cups onto it from one of the tables of onlookers. The crockery clatters and knocks together, maybe chipping, but Dan can&rsquo;t find it in himself to care. Phil rambles on, voice raising over the noise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not explaining myself very well, my mind&rsquo;s all floopy. Amanda said it so well-&rdquo;</p><p>At the sound of her name, Dan drops the tray. A lot of it survives, but a teapot smashes into pieces, which ricochet across the floor. Some of the onlookers clap and jeer, not helping Dan&rsquo;s growing feelings of vexation. Immediately Phil is on his knees, scrambling to collect the pieces. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it for fuck&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Dan snaps, dropping to his knees as well. He bats Phil&rsquo;s hands away from the broken pieces. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll slice your hand open, let me do it.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil watches without argument as Dan gathers the larger bits and puts them carefully on the tray. Louise approaches, brandishing a dustpan and brush. She inclines her head, telling them both without words to move aside. As Dan stands, Phil steps towards him, catching hold of his wrists. Dan backs up, but Phil just moves with him, holding tight.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it so that you&rsquo;ll understand,&rdquo; Phil says. There&rsquo;s a desperation so deep, so strong in his face that Dan stops trying. He&rsquo;s going to have to endure, to listen to whatever ridiculous speech Phil is about to give. He sighs, trying uselessly to steel himself for the cut of the jagged knife in Phil&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can find the right words. So here.&rdquo;</p><p>At first, Dan is baffled. Phil is digging into his jeans pocket, and then he tucks something into Dan&rsquo;s fist. Slowly, Dan&rsquo;s eyes lower to it, and he unfurls his fingers. There, laid in the centre of his palm, are two black pearls, fixed onto thin silver stems.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Dan says, locked on the earrings. &ldquo;Did she not want them?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil shakes his head. He smells so dreamy, this close. Like fresh rainwater, sweetened with a splash of syrup. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re yours, Dan. They were always yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan swallows around a lump of coal lodged in his throat. His heart is doing that strange thrumming again; this time he can feel it right down in his fingertips. </p><p>&ldquo;You bought these for Amanda,&rdquo; Dan says, though his voice wobbles, like he&rsquo;s not sure of that truth.</p><p>Phil smiles very slightly. &ldquo;I thought so, too. But I was kidding myself, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; He plucks one of the earrings and slips the back off. He&rsquo;s gentle, almost reverent, as he reaches up, pressing it into Dan&rsquo;s ear. When it&rsquo;s fastened, Dan is utterly still, too bemused to move an inch. Phil leans back, a breath of laughter escaping. &ldquo;Anyone with half a brain could see. These are made for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Something hot and stinging smarts Dan&rsquo;s eyes, the back of his nose. &ldquo;What- what are you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m in love with my best friend,&rdquo; Phil says. He&rsquo;s reaching past Dan&rsquo;s cheek, to fix the other earring in place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying I always have been.&rdquo;</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s vaguely aware of an audience, watching what has become quite the scene, silently gawping at a confession Dan could not have predicted if he tried. All he can hear are the words Phil just spoke. </p><p><i>In love. </i></p><p><i>In love with my best friend.</i></p><p>&ldquo;What about Amanda?&rdquo;</p><p>Phil has inched closer now. Too close for friends. </p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Phil whispers, and then kisses him. </p><p>It&rsquo;s light, angelic, as if he&rsquo;s scared Dan&rsquo;s going to bolt out of the door. It&rsquo;s such a sweet, gentle kiss that Dan thinks he might die from the softness. Instead he falls in, headfirst, helpless to surrender to the weighty swell of watery affection that swamps around him, drowning him in the warm euphoria of his deepest desire.</p><p><b>(Chapter 11 coming next Tuesday at 8pm GMT!)</b></p>",

The barren path he trudges down is frosted with a sheet of white, thinner than a sleeve of cr&ecirc;pe paper. The route home from Phil&rsquo;s winds around the town&rsquo;s park - a generous term for the patch of grass near a Primary school, vaguely upkept by an elderly man in a jumpsuit occasionally seen pulling weeds. The cold, endless winter has left the park dry and brown, a perfect reflection of Dan&rsquo;s mood. There&rsquo;s a dilapidated children&rsquo;s playground at one end of the park, surrounded by a chain link fence. Inside, the metal swings and climbing frames are rusted to the point of danger. It&rsquo;s doubtful that any sound-minded parents allow their kids to brave them anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As he walks by the skate park at the other end, Dan slows a little, surveying what&rsquo;s become of it. When he was around seven or eight, Dan would sneak out here to watch Ricky skate with his friends. He&rsquo;d loiter at the edge of the concrete, pretending to be just passing by. Ricky would yell at him to go home, tell him he was too young to be there and to stop pestering him. Dan recalls the sneer on his brother&rsquo;s face so clearly, even now. At twelve years old, Ricky was just as mean, just as angry as he is today. It didn&rsquo;t deter Dan, back then. As a child, all Dan wanted was to be his older brother, to emulate him, or at least to befriend him. </p>\n</p>",
