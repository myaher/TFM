You placed a bookmark on the page you were currently reading and tiredly walked to the door.\u00a0</p><p>You knew it was about to be six o&rsquo; clock in the morning, but your body wasn&rsquo;t allowing you to sleep the night prior. You suffered with insomnia. You wanted to be able to sleep however every time you tried, you would wake up five minutes later. And to top it all off, you knew you had so much work to do in an hours time. Maybe even in thirty minutes.</p><p>Currently, Tony was still throwing another one of his famous parties. It wasn\u2019t like it was anything foreign, you\u2019ve gotten used to them by now. But you preferred to be left alone in your room. You had made one rule \n\nstrictly clear to Tony.\u00a0</p><p>No one is allowed to come up bothering you.</p><p>However it did puzzle you as to who would be at your door this early. Couldn\u2019t be any of the Avengers, because you&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re all either dead-beat tired, way far off drunk, or just trying to toy with you. It can\u2019t be any of your other friends because they treasure their sleeping time. And Loki, well you&rsquo;re sure Loki wouldn&rsquo;t have come-\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;Oh hey, Loki?&rdquo; you answered surprised when you opened the door.</p><!-- more --><p>He bowed his head. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he asked.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and stepped back to give him room to walk in. He slowly walked in and went to the middle of the room. You slowly closed the door and walked behind your boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alright? You don&rsquo;t usually come over this early-&rdquo;</p><p>He spun around and immediately pressed his lips to yours. You widened your eyes in surprise but then closed them in pleasure. You wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled him closer. This kiss was a bit more rough and desperate compared to his usual gentle and soft ones. He pulled away and looked down.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s early, but this is one of my only chances I get to spend some time with you without an interruption,&rdquo; he muttered.\u00a0</p><p>You frowned. &ldquo;Did something happen back in Asgard?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>He shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he lied, &ldquo;I just want to spend some time with you.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded unconvinced and led him over towards your bed. He sat down and rested his head against the headboard.\u00a0&quot;Did you want to watch a movie? I don&rsquo;t have many but I do have the Harry Potter series, The Fault in Our Stars, Titanic, and the Lego Movie.\u201d</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you my flower,&rdquo; he responded.\u00a0</p><p>You smiled lightly and put in the Lego Movie. It wasn&rsquo;t a sappy chick flick, that you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t like, and it was funny. Plus, something seemed to be bothering him and you wanted to lighten the mood.</p><p>Once it began to start, you crawled onto your bed and sat up next to Loki. You tangle your legs with his and laid your head on his chest. He wrapped his arms around you, providing warmth. You smile and snuggle into his chest as he kissed the top of your head and rests his chin on it. But within fifteen minutes into the movie, your eyelids began to droop. And soon enough, you fell into a deep slumber until later in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Attention Agent Y/L/N! Report to the main corridor right now!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>You jolted awake and immediately grabbed your walkie-talkie from the table on the side of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Be right there,&rdquo; you mumbled and tossed it on the side of your bed. You looked up at Loki to see him peacefully sleeping against the headboard. He&rsquo;s going to have such a pain in his neck when he wakes up. You frown and get off of Loki&rsquo;s lap. You went into your bathroom and changed out of your pajamas and into your regular work attire.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N!&rdquo; your walkie-talkie screamed from your room.</p><p>You groaned and rushed to grab it so Loki was not woken up. You pressed the mic and spoke into it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way, give me one second.&quot;\u00a0</p><p>You clip it to your waist band and tiredly run your brush through your Y/H/C hair. You&rsquo;ve only gotten an hour of sleep and you knew you were not in the mood for any loud noises coming from your walkie-talkie.</p><p>You tiredly rubbed your eyes and yawned. You put your brush down on a table and was about to exit when a hand gripped your wrist. You turned your head and met those familiar pair of green eyes. They looked just as tired as yours but his looked more distressed.\u00a0</p><p>&quot;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go to work. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up as quickly as possible, I don&rsquo;t have that much work,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not that much work, could you not possible stay with me?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>You frowned at his response. &ldquo;Loki, I really want to but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N, would you please report to the main corridor!&rdquo; it yelled once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my damn way! Can a woman not get ready first?!&rdquo; you screamed back into it.</p><p>You took a deep breath, closing your eyes and looking back at Loki. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, baby. I can&rsquo;t stay. I&rsquo;ll see you after work, give me a few hours, okay?&rdquo; you frowned, lightly holding onto his cheek.</p><p>He sighed lightly and nodded looking down. He let go of your wrists and groaned from the pain in his neck.\u00a0</p><p>Knew it.</p><p>You lightly pressed your lips to his and gave him a tight embrace. Before your walkie-talkie was going to go off again, you quickly rushed out of your room.</p><hr><p>You sat at your desk rubbing your temples. You had just completed a week&rsquo;s paperwork done in a day and need a break. You closed your eyes for one second and rested your head on your hand.</p><p>\u00a0All you really wanted to do was get a good nights rest with Loki. He always gave you this warmth that made you feel safe and protected from harm. He was the one that made you feel like you could go to oblivion with. You were about to doze off when a voice rang through the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Y/N!&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s loud booming voice yelled.</p><p>You opened your eyes and gasped in a slight panic from the sudden loud noise but calmed when you saw him. Your head was pounding and you gave him a weak smile. &ldquo;Oh, hey Thor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright, miss?&rdquo; he asked looking at your tired state,&ldquo; You look a bit disheveled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; everything is just-&rdquo; you paused and yawned, but quickly covered your mouth while doing so, &ldquo;Everything is just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, a coffee would be nice,&rdquo; you mumbled, rubbing your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you called as he walked off to get your coffee, going back to work.</p><hr><p>A few hours later you finally finished all your work and can relax for maybe a day or two. You ran your hand through your hair for the millionth time and slowly lowered your head to your desk.</p><p>A loud bang suddenly was on your desk and you immediately raised your head. In front of you was Agent Fury with a bunch of papers stacked and piled on top of each other. A flash of agony showed in your eyes as you stared at the white papers.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best Agent Y/N,&rdquo; he winked with his one available eye,&ldquo; I know you can handle this, right?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed and nodded your head not wanting to disappoint him. He was like a father to you. &ldquo;Yes of course, I&rsquo;ll get to it right away sir,&rdquo; you said forcing a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;This is why you&rsquo;re my favorite,&rdquo; he grinned and walked away. You mentally cried as you grabbed some of the paperwork to get started on.</p><p>Loki then walked in and had a faint smile. &ldquo;Hello my flower,&rdquo; he spoke.</p><p>You smiled upon hearing his name. &ldquo;Hey, is everything alright?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is perfect,&rdquo; he grinned as bent down to press his lips to yours. You smiled into the kiss and pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you in such a good mood?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing my beautiful flower. Come with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>You had a smile present on your face but soon slowly faded into a frown. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; I-&rdquo; you trailed off.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo; he questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm- not with you, but with my job and all the work I have to do yes. I really want to go with you, but if I do not get this done now, I&rsquo;ll be busy for who knows how long else,&rdquo; you frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; was all he said. He nodded and walked out with his head hung low.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, wait!&rdquo; you frowned. But he never came back.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N,&rdquo; Fury called once more carrying more paperwork.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; you groan as he approached your desk once more.</p><hr><p>Finally, it was the end of your work shift.\u00a0Your brain was fried.\u00a0</p><p>No more.\u00a0</p><p>You cannot handle anymore work. Agent Fury kept piling work on your desk from the last hour. You managed to get it all done, however it was a struggle with you not being able to say no.\u00a0</p><p>You finished the last paper and stood up immediately. You cracked your sore knuckles and yawned. You looked at the time and it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it could be. It was only four in the afternoon and the sun was still shining.</p><p>You quickly were about to walk out, but Agent Fury came back.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going Y/L/N?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Fury, I love you to death but I&rsquo;ve been working my ass off the entire last month and this month. I&rsquo;ve taken as much work as I can right now and if do anymore I&rsquo;m going to go crazy&hellip;but&hellip;,&rdquo; you paused, &ldquo;But I need to go see Loki because he&rsquo;s been slightly off and I need to see what&rsquo;s wrong with him. So please, just this once let me have a-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I respect you Y/N, and frankly you&rsquo;re still my favorite because you know how to get the job done. Go see him,&rdquo; he grinned and walked of.</p><p>You let out a huge breath of relief and began to run to the living room where you&rsquo;d expect him to be. But no one was there. You furrowed your eyebrows and searched everywhere in the tower but still no one was around. You stomped your foot once you reached the lab. You&rsquo;d expect at least Bruce to be there of all people. But he wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS, where is everybody?&rdquo; you asked placing your hands on your hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Master Y/L/N everyone has left the Stark tower about four hours ago and has not returned. Master Laufeyson ordered them to earlier while you were away,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, JARVIS,&rdquo; you said and walk out of the lab.</p><p>Was Loki still in the Stark Tower or did he go back to Asgard?</p><p>You knew he wasn&rsquo;t in any of the room that you&rsquo;ve searched in and sighed in defeat going back to your room. You&rsquo;d wait for Thor to come back so that you could ask him to help you locate Loki. After all, he is his brother and he has the power to go to Asgard to search for you.</p><p>You walked tiredly to your room and opened it. It was awfully dark despite the fact that it was still sunny outside. The curtains were closed making so it was dark. The was a lump in your bed and you knew exactly who it was.</p><p>You closed your door and slowly made your way to the curtains, you opened them slightly so you could see better, but so that it was still a bit dark for Loki. You made your way over towards your bed and stood there frowning at your boyfriend. He was wrapped up in your duvet and holding one of your pillows close to his chest.</p><p>His cheeks had little tear stains on them which made your eyes sting from wanting to cry. All Loki wanted to do was hang out with you, his girlfriend. The one who accepted him despite everything his is and what he&rsquo;s done in his past, but you kept pushing him away to do your stupid job. And you would&rsquo;ve been done earlier if it wasn&rsquo;t for Agent Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; you whispered and slowly crawled onto the bed.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and looked at you. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he asked, slowly waking up.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you cry&hellip; I was just really busy and if I didn&rsquo;t get most of that done today then I would be busy for who knows how long and I&rsquo;m just sorry,&rdquo; you spoke all at once.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t crying&hellip;,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>You weakly smiled and rolled your eyes sadly. &ldquo;Loki, you don&rsquo;t have to lie. You&rsquo;re human&hellip; well a God&hellip; but you know what I mean! I&rsquo;m just so sorry. It won&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; you frowned,&ldquo; I must seem like the biggest jackass right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such things about yourself, my love,&rdquo; he whispered sitting up and pulling you onto his lap. &ldquo;I love you for you and you are flawless in my eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and grabbed the back of his neck. You pulled him towards you and pressed your lips against his. You ran your free hand through his black raven hair and giggled as you both fell to your sides while kissing each other. You pulled away and smiled as he laughed.\u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, my flower,&rdquo; he whispered, pushing away the hair out of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; you smiled and snuggled into his chest.</p><p>And later that night you both stayed up watching movies all night and cuddled without any interruptions.</p>",

But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, where is everybody?\u201d you asked placing your hands on your hips.</p><p>\u201cMaster Y/L/N everyone has left the Stark tower about four hours ago and has not returned. Master Laufeyson ordered them to earlier while you were away,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThank you, JARVIS,\u201d you said and walk out of the lab.</p><p>Was Loki still in the Stark Tower or did he go back to Asgard?</p><p>You knew he wasn\u2019t in any of the room that you\u2019ve searched in and sighed in defeat going back to your room. You\u2019d wait for Thor to come back so that you could ask him to help you locate Loki. After all, he is his brother and he has the power to go to Asgard to search for you.</p><p>You walked tiredly to your room and opened it. It was awfully dark despite the fact that it was still sunny outside. The curtains were closed making so it was dark. The was a lump in your bed and you knew exactly who it was.</p><p>You closed your door and slowly made your way to the curtains, you opened them slightly so you could see better, but so that it was still a bit dark for Loki. You made your way over towards your bed and stood there frowning at your boyfriend. He was wrapped up in your duvet and holding one of your pillows close to his chest.</p><p>His cheeks had little tear stains on them which made your eyes sting from wanting to cry. All Loki wanted to do was hang out with you, his girlfriend. The one who accepted him despite everything his is and what he\u2019s done in his past, but you kept pushing him away to do your stupid job. And you would\u2019ve been done earlier if it wasn\u2019t for Agent Fury.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u2026\u201d you whispered and slowly crawled onto the bed.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and looked at you. \u201cY/N?\u201d he asked, slowly waking up.</p><p>\u201cLoki, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you cry\u2026 I was just really busy and if I didn\u2019t get most of that done today then I would be busy for who knows how long and I\u2019m just sorry,\u201d you spoke all at once.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t crying\u2026,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>You weakly smiled and rolled your eyes sadly. \u201cLoki, you don\u2019t have to lie. You\u2019re human\u2026 well a God\u2026 but you know what I mean! I\u2019m just so sorry. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d you frowned,\u201c I must seem like the biggest jackass right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such things about yourself, my love,\u201d he whispered sitting up and pulling you onto his lap. \u201cI love you for you and you are flawless in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>You smiled and grabbed the back of his neck. You pulled him towards you and pressed your lips against his. You ran your free hand through his black raven hair and giggled as you both fell to your sides while kissing each other. You pulled away and smiled as he laughed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, my flower,\u201d he whispered, pushing away the hair out of your face.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d you smiled and snuggled into his chest.</p><p>And later that night you both stayed up watching movies all night and cuddled without any interruptions.</p></p>",

Overall I don\u2019t really like how I wrote this, but I know I took long to get to this. Hopefully you like it.</p><p>Warnings: Sad Loki</p><hr><p>\n\nYou sat on your couch silently reading your book when a soft knock was heard coming from your bedroom door in the tower. You placed a bookmark on the page you were currently reading and tiredly walked to the door.\u00a0</p><p>You knew it was about to be six o\u2019 clock in the morning, but your body wasn\u2019t allowing you to sleep the night prior. You suffered with insomnia. You wanted to be able to sleep however every time you tried, you would wake up five minutes later. And to top it all off, you knew you had so much work to do in an hours time. Maybe even in thirty minutes.</p><p>Currently, Tony was still throwing another one of his famous parties. It wasn\u2019t like it was anything foreign, you\u2019ve gotten used to them by now. But you preferred to be left alone in your room. You had made one rule \n\nstrictly clear to Tony.\u00a0</p><p>No one is allowed to come up bothering you.</p><p>However it did puzzle you as to who would be at your door this early. Couldn\u2019t be any of the Avengers, because you\u2019re sure they\u2019re all either dead-beat tired, way far off drunk, or just trying to toy with you. It can\u2019t be any of your other friends because they treasure their sleeping time. And Loki, well you\u2019re sure Loki wouldn\u2019t have come-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hey, Loki?\u201d you answered surprised when you opened the door.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He bowed his head. \u201cMay I?\u201d he asked.\u00a0</p><p>You nodded and stepped back to give him room to walk in. He slowly walked in and went to the middle of the room. You slowly closed the door and walked behind your boyfriend.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAre you alright? You don\u2019t usually come over this early-\u201d</p><p>He spun around and immediately pressed his lips to yours. You widened your eyes in surprise but then closed them in pleasure. You wrapped your arms around his neck and pulled him closer. This kiss was a bit more rough and desperate compared to his usual gentle and soft ones. He pulled away and looked down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s early, but this is one of my only chances I get to spend some time with you without an interruption,\u201d he muttered.\u00a0</p><p>You frowned. \u201cDid something happen back in Asgard?\u201d you asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he lied, \u201cI just want to spend some time with you.\u201d</p><p>You nodded unconvinced and led him over towards your bed. He sat down and rested his head against the headboard.\u00a0\"Did you want to watch a movie? I don\u2019t have many but I do have the Harry Potter series, The Fault in Our Stars, Titanic, and the Lego Movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you my flower,\u201d he responded.\u00a0</p><p>You smiled lightly and put in the Lego Movie. It wasn\u2019t a sappy chick flick, that you knew he wouldn\u2019t like, and it was funny. Plus, something seemed to be bothering him and you wanted to lighten the mood.</p><p>Once it began to start, you crawled onto your bed and sat up next to Loki. You tangle your legs with his and laid your head on his chest. He wrapped his arms around you, providing warmth. You smile and snuggle into his chest as he kissed the top of your head and rests his chin on it. But within fifteen minutes into the movie, your eyelids began to droop. And soon enough, you fell into a deep slumber until later in the morning.</p><p>\u201c<i>Attention Agent Y/L/N! Report to the main corridor right now!</i>\u201d</p><p>You jolted awake and immediately grabbed your walkie-talkie from the table on the side of your bed.</p><p>\u201cBe right there,\u201d you mumbled and tossed it on the side of your bed. You looked up at Loki to see him peacefully sleeping against the headboard. He\u2019s going to have such a pain in his neck when he wakes up. You frown and get off of Loki\u2019s lap. You went into your bathroom and changed out of your pajamas and into your regular work attire.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAgent Y/L/N!\u201d your walkie-talkie screamed from your room.</p><p>You groaned and rushed to grab it so Loki was not woken up. You pressed the mic and spoke into it. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, give me one second.\"\u00a0</p><p>You clip it to your waist band and tiredly run your brush through your Y/H/C hair. You\u2019ve only gotten an hour of sleep and you knew you were not in the mood for any loud noises coming from your walkie-talkie.</p><p>You tiredly rubbed your eyes and yawned. You put your brush down on a table and was about to exit when a hand gripped your wrist. You turned your head and met those familiar pair of green eyes. They looked just as tired as yours but his looked more distressed.\u00a0</p><p>\"Where are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to work. I\u2019ll try to finish up as quickly as possible, I don\u2019t have that much work,\u201d you said.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not that much work, could you not possible stay with me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>You frowned at his response. \u201cLoki, I really want to but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Y/L/N, would you please report to the main corridor!\u201d it yelled once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my damn way! Can a woman not get ready first?!\u201d you screamed back into it.</p><p>You took a deep breath, closing your eyes and looking back at Loki. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I can\u2019t stay. I\u2019ll see you after work, give me a few hours, okay?\u201d you frowned, lightly holding onto his cheek.</p><p>He sighed lightly and nodded looking down. He let go of your wrists and groaned from the pain in his neck.\u00a0</p><p>Knew it.</p><p>You lightly pressed your lips to his and gave him a tight embrace. Before your walkie-talkie was going to go off again, you quickly rushed out of your room.</p><hr><p>You sat at your desk rubbing your temples. You had just completed a week\u2019s paperwork done in a day and need a break. You closed your eyes for one second and rested your head on your hand.</p><p>\u00a0All you really wanted to do was get a good nights rest with Loki. He always gave you this warmth that made you feel safe and protected from harm. He was the one that made you feel like you could go to oblivion with. You were about to doze off when a voice rang through the room.</p><p>\u201cHello, Y/N!\u201d Thor\u2019s loud booming voice yelled.</p><p>You opened your eyes and gasped in a slight panic from the sudden loud noise but calmed when you saw him. Your head was pounding and you gave him a weak smile. \u201cOh, hey Thor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright, miss?\u201d he asked looking at your tired state,\u201c You look a bit disheveled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 everything is just-\u201d you paused and yawned, but quickly covered your mouth while doing so, \u201cEverything is just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMmm, a coffee would be nice,\u201d you mumbled, rubbing your eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d he grinned.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you called as he walked off to get your coffee, going back to work.</p><hr><p>A few hours later you finally finished all your work and can relax for maybe a day or two. You ran your hand through your hair for the millionth time and slowly lowered your head to your desk.</p><p>A loud bang suddenly was on your desk and you immediately raised your head. In front of you was Agent Fury with a bunch of papers stacked and piled on top of each other. A flash of agony showed in your eyes as you stared at the white papers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best Agent Y/N,\u201d he winked with his one available eye,\u201c I know you can handle this, right?\u201d</p><p>You sighed and nodded your head not wanting to disappoint him. He was like a father to you. \u201cYes of course, I\u2019ll get to it right away sir,\u201d you said forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you\u2019re my favorite,\u201d he grinned and walked away. You mentally cried as you grabbed some of the paperwork to get started on.</p><p>Loki then walked in and had a faint smile. \u201cHello my flower,\u201d he spoke.</p><p>You smiled upon hearing his name. \u201cHey, is everything alright?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything is perfect,\u201d he grinned as bent down to press his lips to yours. You smiled into the kiss and pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you in such a good mood?\u201d you asked.</p><p>\u201cSeeing my beautiful flower. Come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he smiled.</p><p>You had a smile present on your face but soon slowly faded into a frown. \u201cLoki\u2026 I-\u201d you trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201cUhm- not with you, but with my job and all the work I have to do yes. I really want to go with you, but if I do not get this done now, I\u2019ll be busy for who knows how long else,\u201d you frowned.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d was all he said. He nodded and walked out with his head hung low.</p><p>\u201cLoki, wait!\u201d you frowned. But he never came back.</p><p>\u201cAgent Y/L/N,\u201d Fury called once more carrying more paperwork.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d you groan as he approached your desk once more.</p><hr><p>Finally, it was the end of your work shift.\u00a0Your brain was fried.\u00a0</p><p>No more.\u00a0</p><p>You cannot handle anymore work. Agent Fury kept piling work on your desk from the last hour. You managed to get it all done, however it was a struggle with you not being able to say no.\u00a0</p><p>You finished the last paper and stood up immediately. You cracked your sore knuckles and yawned. You looked at the time and it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could be. It was only four in the afternoon and the sun was still shining.</p><p>You quickly were about to walk out, but Agent Fury came back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going Y/L/N?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLook, Fury, I love you to death but I\u2019ve been working my ass off the entire last month and this month. I\u2019ve taken as much work as I can right now and if do anymore I\u2019m going to go crazy\u2026but\u2026,\u201d you paused, \u201cBut I need to go see Loki because he\u2019s been slightly off and I need to see what\u2019s wrong with him. So please, just this once let me have a-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect you Y/N, and frankly you\u2019re still my favorite because you know how to get the job done. Go see him,\u201d he grinned and walked of.</p><p>You let out a huge breath of relief and began to run to the living room where you\u2019d expect him to be. But no one was there. You furrowed your eyebrows and searched everywhere in the tower but still no one was around. You stomped your foot once you reached the lab. You\u2019d expect at least Bruce to be there of all people. But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJARVIS, where is everybody?\u201d you asked placing your hands on your hips.</p><p>\u201cMaster Y/L/N everyone has left the Stark tower about four hours ago and has not returned. Master Laufeyson ordered them to earlier while you were away,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThank you, JARVIS,\u201d you said and walk out of the lab.</p><p>Was Loki still in the Stark Tower or did he go back to Asgard?</p><p>You knew he wasn\u2019t in any of the room that you\u2019ve searched in and sighed in defeat going back to your room.

Plus, something seemed to be bothering him and you wanted to lighten the mood.</p><p>Once it began to start, you crawled onto your bed and sat up next to Loki. You tangle your legs with his and laid your head on his chest. He wrapped his arms around you, providing warmth. You smile and snuggle into his chest as he kissed the top of your head and rests his chin on it. But within fifteen minutes into the movie, your eyelids began to droop. And soon enough, you fell into a deep slumber until later in the morning.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Attention Agent Y/L/N! Report to the main corridor right now!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>You jolted awake and immediately grabbed your walkie-talkie from the table on the side of your bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Be right there,&rdquo; you mumbled and tossed it on the side of your bed. You looked up at Loki to see him peacefully sleeping against the headboard. He&rsquo;s going to have such a pain in his neck when he wakes up. You frown and get off of Loki&rsquo;s lap. You went into your bathroom and changed out of your pajamas and into your regular work attire.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N!&rdquo; your walkie-talkie screamed from your room.</p><p>You groaned and rushed to grab it so Loki was not woken up. You pressed the mic and spoke into it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way, give me one second.\"&nbsp;</p><p>You clip it to your waist band and tiredly run your brush through your Y/H/C hair. You&rsquo;ve only gotten an hour of sleep and you knew you were not in the mood for any loud noises coming from your walkie-talkie.</p><p>You tiredly rubbed your eyes and yawned. You put your brush down on a table and was about to exit when a hand gripped your wrist. You turned your head and met those familiar pair of green eyes. They looked just as tired as yours but his looked more distressed.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I have to go to work. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up as quickly as possible, I don&rsquo;t have that much work,&rdquo; you said.</p><p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not that much work, could you not possible stay with me?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>You frowned at his response. &ldquo;Loki, I really want to but-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N, would you please report to the main corridor!&rdquo; it yelled once more.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my damn way! Can a woman not get ready first?!&rdquo; you screamed back into it.</p><p>You took a deep breath, closing your eyes and looking back at Loki. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, baby. I can&rsquo;t stay. I&rsquo;ll see you after work, give me a few hours, okay?&rdquo; you frowned, lightly holding onto his cheek.</p><p>He sighed lightly and nodded looking down. He let go of your wrists and groaned from the pain in his neck.&nbsp;</p><p>Knew it.</p><p>You lightly pressed your lips to his and gave him a tight embrace. Before your walkie-talkie was going to go off again, you quickly rushed out of your room.</p><hr /><p>You sat at your desk rubbing your temples. You had just completed a week&rsquo;s paperwork done in a day and need a break. You closed your eyes for one second and rested your head on your hand.</p><p>&nbsp;All you really wanted to do was get a good nights rest with Loki. He always gave you this warmth that made you feel safe and protected from harm. He was the one that made you feel like you could go to oblivion with. You were about to doze off when a voice rang through the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, Y/N!&rdquo; Thor&rsquo;s loud booming voice yelled.</p><p>You opened your eyes and gasped in a slight panic from the sudden loud noise but calmed when you saw him. Your head was pounding and you gave him a weak smile. &ldquo;Oh, hey Thor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything alright, miss?&rdquo; he asked looking at your tired state,&ldquo; You look a bit disheveled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; everything is just-&rdquo; you paused and yawned, but quickly covered your mouth while doing so, &ldquo;Everything is just fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like anything?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm, a coffee would be nice,&rdquo; you mumbled, rubbing your eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; he grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you called as he walked off to get your coffee, going back to work.</p><hr /><p>A few hours later you finally finished all your work and can relax for maybe a day or two. You ran your hand through your hair for the millionth time and slowly lowered your head to your desk.</p><p>A loud bang suddenly was on your desk and you immediately raised your head. In front of you was Agent Fury with a bunch of papers stacked and piled on top of each other. A flash of agony showed in your eyes as you stared at the white papers.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my best Agent Y/N,&rdquo; he winked with his one available eye,&ldquo; I know you can handle this, right?&rdquo;</p><p>You sighed and nodded your head not wanting to disappoint him. He was like a father to you. &ldquo;Yes of course, I&rsquo;ll get to it right away sir,&rdquo; you said forcing a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;This is why you&rsquo;re my favorite,&rdquo; he grinned and walked away. You mentally cried as you grabbed some of the paperwork to get started on.</p><p>Loki then walked in and had a faint smile. &ldquo;Hello my flower,&rdquo; he spoke.</p><p>You smiled upon hearing his name. &ldquo;Hey, is everything alright?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is perfect,&rdquo; he grinned as bent down to press his lips to yours. You smiled into the kiss and pulled away.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you in such a good mood?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing my beautiful flower. Come with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he smiled.</p><p>You had a smile present on your face but soon slowly faded into a frown. &ldquo;Loki&hellip; I-&rdquo; you trailed off.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo; he questioned.</p><p>&ldquo;Uhm- not with you, but with my job and all the work I have to do yes. I really want to go with you, but if I do not get this done now, I&rsquo;ll be busy for who knows how long else,&rdquo; you frowned.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; was all he said. He nodded and walked out with his head hung low.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, wait!&rdquo; you frowned. But he never came back.</p><p>&ldquo;Agent Y/L/N,&rdquo; Fury called once more carrying more paperwork.</p><p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; you groan as he approached your desk once more.</p><hr /><p>Finally, it was the end of your work shift.&nbsp;Your brain was fried.&nbsp;</p><p>No more.&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot handle anymore work. Agent Fury kept piling work on your desk from the last hour. You managed to get it all done, however it was a struggle with you not being able to say no.&nbsp;</p><p>You finished the last paper and stood up immediately. You cracked your sore knuckles and yawned. You looked at the time and it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it could be. It was only four in the afternoon and the sun was still shining.</p><p>You quickly were about to walk out, but Agent Fury came back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going Y/L/N?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, Fury, I love you to death but I&rsquo;ve been working my ass off the entire last month and this month. I&rsquo;ve taken as much work as I can right now and if do anymore I&rsquo;m going to go crazy&hellip;but&hellip;,&rdquo; you paused, &ldquo;But I need to go see Loki because he&rsquo;s been slightly off and I need to see what&rsquo;s wrong with him. So please, just this once let me have a-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I respect you Y/N, and frankly you&rsquo;re still my favorite because you know how to get the job done. Go see him,&rdquo; he grinned and walked of.</p><p>You let out a huge breath of relief and began to run to the living room where you&rsquo;d expect him to be. But no one was there. You furrowed your eyebrows and searched everywhere in the tower but still no one was around. You stomped your foot once you reached the lab. You&rsquo;d expect at least Bruce to be there of all people. But he wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>&ldquo;JARVIS, where is everybody?&rdquo; you asked placing your hands on your hips.</p><p>&ldquo;Master Y/L/N everyone has left the Stark tower about four hours ago and has not returned. Master Laufeyson ordered them to earlier while you were away,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, JARVIS,&rdquo; you said and walk out of the lab.</p><p>Was Loki still in the Stark Tower or did he go back to Asgard?</p><p>You knew he wasn&rsquo;t in any of the room that you&rsquo;ve searched in and sighed in defeat going back to your room. You&rsquo;d wait for Thor to come back so that you could ask him to help you locate Loki. After all, he is his brother and he has the power to go to Asgard to search for you.</p><p>You walked tiredly to your room and opened it. It was awfully dark despite the fact that it was still sunny outside. The curtains were closed making so it was dark. The was a lump in your bed and you knew exactly who it was.</p><p>You closed your door and slowly made your way to the curtains, you opened them slightly so you could see better, but so that it was still a bit dark for Loki. You made your way over towards your bed and stood there frowning at your boyfriend. He was wrapped up in your duvet and holding one of your pillows close to his chest.</p><p>His cheeks had little tear stains on them which made your eyes sting from wanting to cry. All Loki wanted to do was hang out with you, his girlfriend. The one who accepted him despite everything his is and what he&rsquo;s done in his past, but you kept pushing him away to do your stupid job. And you would&rsquo;ve been done earlier if it wasn&rsquo;t for Agent Fury.</p><p>&ldquo;Baby&hellip;&rdquo; you whispered and slowly crawled onto the bed.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and looked at you. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; he asked, slowly waking up.</p><p>&ldquo;Loki, I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you cry&hellip; I was just really busy and if I didn&rsquo;t get most of that done today then I would be busy for who knows how long and I&rsquo;m just sorry,&rdquo; you spoke all at once.</p><p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t crying&hellip;,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>You weakly smiled and rolled your eyes sadly. &ldquo;Loki, you don&rsquo;t have to lie. You&rsquo;re human&hellip; well a God&hellip; but you know what I mean! I&rsquo;m just so sorry. It won&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; you frowned,&ldquo; I must seem like the biggest jackass right now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such things about yourself, my love,&rdquo; he whispered sitting up and pulling you onto his lap. &ldquo;I love you for you and you are flawless in my eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>You smiled and grabbed the back of his neck. You pulled him towards you and pressed your lips against his. You ran your free hand through his black raven hair and giggled as you both fell to your sides while kissing each other. You pulled away and smiled as he laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I love you so much, my flower,&rdquo; he whispered, pushing away the hair out of your face.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too,&rdquo; you smiled and snuggled into his chest.</p><p>And later that night you both stayed up watching movies all night and cuddled without any interruptions.</p></p>",

Hopefully you like it.</p>\n<p>Warnings: Sad Loki</p>\n<hr />\n<p>\n\nYou sat on your couch silently reading your book when a soft knock was heard coming from your bedroom door in the tower. You placed a bookmark on the page you were currently reading and tiredly walked to the door.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You knew it was about to be six o&rsquo; clock in the morning, but your body wasn&rsquo;t allowing you to sleep the night prior. You suffered with insomnia. You wanted to be able to sleep however every time you tried, you would wake up five minutes later. And to top it all off, you knew you had so much work to do in an hours time. Maybe even in thirty minutes.</p>\n<p>Currently, Tony was still throwing another one of his famous parties. It wasn&rsquo;t like it was anything foreign, you&rsquo;ve gotten used to them by now. But you preferred to be left alone in your room. You had made one rule \n\nstrictly clear to Tony.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No one is allowed to come up bothering you.</p>\n<p>However it did puzzle you as to who would be at your door this early. Couldn&rsquo;t be any of the Avengers, because you&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;re all either dead-beat tired, way far off drunk, or just trying to toy with you. It can&rsquo;t be any of your other friends because they treasure their sleeping time. And Loki, well you&rsquo;re sure Loki wouldn&rsquo;t have come-&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Oh hey, Loki?&rdquo; you answered surprised when you opened the door.</p>\n</p>",

He spotted some English letters on the rover&rsquo;s side. They were small, but not enough to escape Loki&rsquo;s divine eyesight.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Opportunity Rover.</i>&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;So your name is Opportunity? Of course the humans would give you a name. They would bond with anything if they tried hard enough.&rdquo; Loki laughed dryly.</p><p>Opportunity continued to repeat her message. Loki listened intently before coming up with a theory.</p><p>&ldquo;I assume you&rsquo;re solar powered, right? Your solar panels seem to be down.&rdquo; Loki pursed his lips before shifting his gaze towards the Sun and where Earth should be. &ldquo;I did tell my idiotic brother that the Sun will shine on us again.&rdquo; He looked back at the rover, who lay helplessly under Mars&rsquo; dust. &ldquo;I suppose I can include that on our little promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki picked up Opportunity, being very careful with her parts, and headed towards his ship. Once inside, he stored and secured Oppy safely and started the engines.</p><p>The ship roared to life and soon, it was up in space. Mars became nothing but a speck among other stars and planets. </p><p>&ldquo;I hope the humans won&rsquo;t mind me bringing you back. I mean, there are currently other more serious problems at hand. Now, let&rsquo;s go find my brother and maybe save the universe, yeah?&rdquo;</p></p>",

And who&rsquo;s gonna take over after they&rsquo;re gone? You guessed it: characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, and Doctor Strange.</p><p>Hmmnn&hellip;. all characters who got dusted! Funny how that works, huh?</p><p>These new characters are briefly being pushed aside, to give the old characters one last hurrah before they are replaced. The only NEW characters who DIDN\u2019T get dusted, are characters who didn\u2019t get screentime in Infinity War, like AntMan and Captain Marvel. So they get screentime in Engame instead! (Though I guess the Wasp got dusted&hellip; she\u2019s the only one who breaks this pattern. Does this mean Marvel hates women more than black people, now?)</p><p>Characters like Tchalla, Falcon, Nick Fury, Peter Parker, and the Guardians of the Galaxy are clearly coming back before Endgame is over. The only fault we should be annoyed over is that the original six Avengers were all white in the first place&hellip; and that\u2019s a choice that was made almost ten years ago.<br/></p><p><br/>As for the second one&hellip;.</p><p>Okay. If there are ANY black people in Captain Marvel who are friendly with the main character AT ALL, they could look like &ldquo;side kicks&rdquo; to some people. Because they are not the main character.</p><p>So&hellip;. By this logic, any movie with a white lead CAN&rsquo;T have black characters at all unless they are the villains, or else they&rsquo;re gonna look like &ldquo;side kicks&rdquo; to the hero.</p><p>Oh wait, but that would be racist, because having the only black characters be VILLAINS is anti-black, right? That&rsquo;s fair.</p><p>So lets make sure movies with white leads NEVER have black characters at all.\u00a0</p><p>OH WAIT.</p><p>That would be seen as racist TOO! So let&rsquo;s have the black people be friends with the lead&ndash;</p><p>&hellip;.uh oh. We&rsquo;re back to square one.</p><p>To be fair, it seems the only fix for this, would be to have ONLY all-black superhero movies. And hey, I wouldn&rsquo;t complain about that. We\u2019ve had enough damn white superhero movies. But how likely is it that Hollywood would stop giving white superheroes anymore movies at all? I think the best case scenario is that Black heroes like T'challa can have allies like Everett Ross, and white heroes like Carol can have allies like Maria Rambeau. Because everyone can be friends regardless of race.<br/></p><p>That being said&hellip; it\u2019s obvious why Carol\u2019s friends mostly consist of people like Fury, Maria, and Monica. Nick Fury is&hellip; do I even have to explain this one? He assembles the Avengers. He needs backstory to show why he\u2019s not surprised by aliens anymore. And it\u2019s nice to see him back when he was happier, and having a good time. Especially since his return in Endgame will surely be as solemn and serious as he usually is.</p><p>And the Rambeaus? If you\u2019re not gonna start with a Rambeau-led Captain Marvel movie, then you better at least feature them! And who knows, having them be friends with Carol could easily lead to Monica taking on the Mantle of Captain Marvel later on. Having Maria (Monica\u2019s mother) in Carol\u2019s first film, which takes place in the 90\u2032s, means that Monica herself will be an adult by the time we skip ahead to the present. So we\u2019ll get more of her for sure.</p><p>Plus, though I would have preferred a Monica Captain Marvel film&hellip; It\u2019s already pretty jarring seeing how bad the hate towards Brie\u2019s Captain Marvel is, (from misogynistic men), I can\u2019t even imagine what the bile towards a Monica movie would be like. I honestly don\u2019t know which starting-point is actually better. :-/</p>",

The only fault we should be annoyed over is that the original six Avengers were all white in the first place\u2026 and that\u2019s a choice that was made almost ten years ago.<br></p><p><br>As for the second one\u2026.</p><p>Okay. If there are ANY black people in Captain Marvel who are friendly with the main character AT ALL, they could look like \u201cside kicks\u201d to some people.

By this logic, any movie with a white lead CAN\u2019T have black characters at all unless they are the villains, or else they\u2019re gonna look like \u201cside kicks\u201d to the hero.</p><p>Oh wait, but that would be racist, because having the only black characters be VILLAINS is anti-black, right? That\u2019s fair.</p><p>So lets make sure movies with white leads NEVER have black characters at all.\u00a0</p><p>OH WAIT.</p><p>That would be seen as racist TOO!

We\u2019ve had enough damn white superhero movies. But how likely is it that Hollywood would stop giving white superheroes anymore movies at all? I think the best case scenario is that Black heroes like T'challa can have allies like Everett Ross, and white heroes like Carol can have allies like Maria Rambeau. Because everyone can be friends regardless of race.<br></p><p>That being said\u2026 it\u2019s obvious why Carol\u2019s friends mostly consist of people like Fury, Maria, and Monica. Nick Fury is\u2026 do I even have to explain this one? He assembles the Avengers. He needs backstory to show why he\u2019s not surprised by aliens anymore. And it\u2019s nice to see him back when he was happier, and having a good time. Especially since his return in Endgame will surely be as solemn and serious as he usually is.</p><p>And the Rambeaus? If you\u2019re not gonna start with a Rambeau-led Captain Marvel movie, then you better at least feature them! And who knows, having them be friends with Carol could easily lead to Monica taking on the Mantle of Captain Marvel later on. Having Maria (Monica\u2019s mother) in Carol\u2019s first film, which takes place in the 90\u2032s, means that Monica herself will be an adult by the time we skip ahead to the present. So we\u2019ll get more of her for sure.</p><p>Plus, though I would have preferred a Monica Captain Marvel film\u2026 It\u2019s already pretty jarring seeing how bad the hate towards Brie\u2019s Captain Marvel is, (from misogynistic men), I can\u2019t even imagine what the bile towards a Monica movie would be like. I honestly don\u2019t know which starting-point is actually better. :-/</p>",
