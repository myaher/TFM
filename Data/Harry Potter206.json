When Lyra Lestrange\u2019s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p style='font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;'><i style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><i><b>Word Count: </b>4858</i></p><p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p><p><b>Chapter Eighteen - Administration</b></p><p>Somehow, Severus managed to keep himself up through the night to ensure that Lyra survived the dose of venomous tentacula juice. From his extensive knowledge of potions and poisons he suspected that the witch would be fine but one hand remained firmly in his pocket clutching a bezoar on the slim chance that he was wrong. Every so often his eyes would glance downwards to check that she was still breathing, usually drawn by her stirring in her sleep.</p><p>Severus\u2019 eyes grew heavy as the night passed. The steadiness of Lyra\u2019s breath tempted him to sleep but he found himself on his feet pacing, keeping his blood circulating to keep himself awake. Eventually he gave in to the use of Wideye Potion and took up Lyra\u2019s offer of reading materials, sneaking into her office to browse. There he found her draft report along with the copious amounts of notes she had made over the weeks she had been working on the solution.</p><!-- more --><p>He gathered the sheets of parchment and sat himself down near the sleeping witch. Just flicking through the pages was telling. Her messy scrawl covered the pages notating and questioning her own ideas, constantly refining her thoughts. She had made notes of each meetings she had with Kettleburn, Sprout and himself. He took particular interest in her writings of their meetings together, he smiled to himself as he noted the small doodles of animated love hearts that she must\u2019ve absentmindedly drawn as he taught her. In amongst the pages were evidence of her frustrations with herself, times where her brilliant mind had become stuck highlighted by a furious scribble.</p><p>Severus found himself admiring and falling for the witch even more as he saw into her mind. He took a quill and shared his own insights on her draft. He hoped that her research would be successful knowing the effort and soul she poured into it. For a moment his mind flickered and played with the idea of her researching the Dark Arts. If she truly had a passion for it and invested her time into it, the results would be devastating. He shuddered at the thought and looked back down at the girl. He didn\u2019t believe there was a way she would fall back into it.</p><p>The Potions Master returned her papers and browsed her desk for other reading materials. He felt rather nosy shuffling through the drawers. He stumbled across moving photographs of herself with her family, Bellatrix and Rodolphus holding her as a young child then more recent ones of her with the Malfoy\u2019s. What surprised him the most was the fact that she only treasured photos of her family and that there was an obvious absence of images of her friends.</p><p>As he continued to dig through the drawers he revealed letters from her family and friends, her most frequent correspondent being her cousin Draco with short sentences and mundane topics. There were even letters in Russian which he longed to read, afraid that there might be something hidden in the foreign language but he pushed it aside and moved on to her healing textbooks.</p><p>They were thick and full of jargon, annotated by Lyra\u2019s writing in the margins and any empty space available. He flicked through and noticed that the notes were present on every page. He attempted to decipher the meanings but he admitted defeat as he realised that his knowledge of the human body and all its parts wasn\u2019t as vast as the witch\u2019s.</p><p>The books managed to amuse him until 7.30am when Lyra finally stirred from her sleep. She reached out and called him over, \u201cSev, I didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in amusement at the witch\u2019s dramatic tendencies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you,\u201d he said, taking a seat on her bed. \u201cYou\u2019re also not purple so I don\u2019t have to kill you which is nice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and groggily sat up in bed, \u201cHow\u2019d you manage last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went through your notes and draft,\u201d he replied, \u201cI made a few notes myself and then I attempted to read your healing books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are some extra reading materials for more advanced healers,\u201d she said, \u201cI was hoping it\u2019d give me an edge over other trainees when it comes to apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>Severus\u2019 face fell slightly, understanding that she was still playing with the option of leaving. It was far in the future but the prospect of her leaving saddened him as he doubted that once she left Hogwarts she would still want him. \u201cAre you planning on doing that at the end of the school year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she said, her hands interlocking with his, \u201cBut I have a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly but her words and kind touch didn\u2019t seem to bring him any comfort. She seemed to sense this and leaned forward to give him a peck on the cheek before nuzzling into his shoulder. It was nice to have her near but he still had an unsettling feeling almost as though there was a slight possibility that she might not fully be his.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged but he could definitely feel his body begging to rest. \u201cNothing a potion can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of enjoying one another\u2019s company the two had breakfast and proceeded to teach. Severus required two more hits of Wideye to get himself through the day and sent Lyra a note to let her know that he would be retiring early. He prepared himself for bed as soon as the last class finished but was disrupted by the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher knocking on his office door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a smile, sliding into the room. \u201cSorry to disturb you. I\u2019m just letting you know that I might not be around for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said with a hint of shock. He had been looking forward to spending more time with her, preferably when they would both be awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to St. Mungo\u2019s to trial the treatment,\u201d she explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a few people in a real bad way and they\u2019re desperate for a cure. I\u2019ve been owling them all day. I\u2019ve already let Albus know.\u201d</p><p>Severus was not one to wear his heart on his sleeve but the disappointment was apparent on his face. Lyra took his hand, tangling their fingers together and gave him a firm squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIf you want you could come and help out?\u201d she offered, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d</p><p>The sweetness of her words were enough for Severus\u2019 heart to skip a beat. He leaned down so his face was in front of hers and kissed her on the lips. He felt her smile against his lips and she wrapped her arms around him to embrace him. They parted and she was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on just going to bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to grab dinner and spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a date?\u201d she teased with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cTo the teacher\u2019s lounge? You deserve much better than that.\u201d</p><p>Lyra exhaled a laugh and the two exited his office. \u201cShould I take you on a date?\u201d he asked nervously, \u201cI mean, do you want to?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly at the Potions Professor as they walked, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds of silence he nodded, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Happily, the two headed to the staff room for dinner. They ate and conversed with their colleagues, catching one another up on the latest school gossip and beginning to stress about the upcoming exams. Once they had finished they returned to the dungeons.</p><p>\u201cShower then sleep?\u201d Lyra asked as she began to shed her outer layers.</p><p>\u201cDoes shower mean what you usually mean?\u201d Severus smirked.</p><p>Her tongue darted between her lips and a smile formed, \u201cIt can if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said, his arms began to snake around her torso. He lowered his voice and whispered in her ear to finish his sentence, \u201cFor you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she whispered back. His lips pressed against hers and they kissed. Severus\u2019 hand crept up her shirt and groped her, teasing her breasts. Lyra\u2019s hands found themselves hastily undoing his shirt.</p><p>They were naked before they hit the bathroom, their bodies tangled in a kiss with their hands freely roaming one another\u2019s bodies. Severus guided them in and pushed her towards the sink countertop, his hands gripped the backs of her thighs and lifted her up. Their lips managed to stay attached to one another until Severus\u2019 hand dipped down between her legs and his fingers slid in so easily into her pussy.</p><p>With a few pumps in and out Lyra threw her head back moaning and begging, \u201cPlease, Sev, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted to tease her he decided against it. Instead, his hands moved from her pussy to his cock and guided it in. There was a moan of relief heard from both of them as he filled her. Roughly, he fucked her against the countertop, his hands firm on her thighs and hers were buried in his hair and clutching his back.</p><p>His mouth made its mark on her neck as he sucked and bit hard on her exposed flesh. He wanted her to be his and his alone. One of Lyra\u2019s hands reached down between her legs and began to rub herself to orgasm. He could feel her pussy clench down hard onto his member as she longed for her release.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d he asked possessively.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she moaned, \u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev. Fuck, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>A loud moan escaped her as her orgasm came crashing down. She swore more as she rode her orgasm out, her body convulsing as she came down. Once she finally relaxed, Severus pulled out of her and spun her around so she was leaning on the counter, her ass in the air.</p><p>Severus fingers teased her pussy and lubricated themselves with her arousal. He then pressed a single digit against the puckered star the lay higher up and forced his way in. Easily, it caved to the pressure and Lyra gasped at the intrusion. His other hand spread her cheeks and he admired how the tight little star gave way to his finger. Slowly, he pushed past the tight outer ring until it began to swallow it whole. Once he got it to the knuckle he moved it in and out slowly, watching for the woman\u2019s reaction to the new sensation.</p><p>Her eyes were squeezed tightly and small groans of pleasure fell from her tight lips. He continued to finger the hole before whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re still so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck this tight little hole,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt heat pool at the bottom of her stomach at the vulgarity of his words. All she could manage was to hum in response once again.</p><p>\u201cI want to put my cock in your ass, Lyra,\u201d he continued to tease as he noticed the red tint that appeared on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to shag you speechless.\u201d</p><p>She moaned once again but this time it was from the intrusion of his fingers in her pussy. He had two fingers in her pussy and one in her asshole but it didn\u2019t feel like it was enough. She didn\u2019t feel as full as she did with his cock in her.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a greedy little slut, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he commented as he added another finger into her pussy. He could tell she enjoyed that as her walls spasmed at the name calling.</p><p>Another digit joined the single one in her asshole as the fingers in her cunt rocked in and out of her. It was met with some resistance but he took it slowly, wanting her to enjoy the experience. Lyra\u2019s hands were gripping the basin as his fingers fucked her closer to another orgasm.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she moaned out, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come,\u201d he said simply, stopping his movements.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she groaned, trying to shuffle back onto his fingers.</p><p>He was amused to watch her hump herself on his hands, not seeming to get enough friction as she said his name again. His fingers began to thrust in and out as she whispered his name. Quickly, he brought her to orgasm before he pulled his fingers out of her sex, leaving the two in her ass there and held them up to her face.</p><p>\u201cLook at the mess you\u2019ve made,\u201d he said, making her blush even more. \u201cClean it up.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra\u2019s mouth open and took the soaked fingers into her mouth. She lapped up her juices from his hand as the fingers in her ass began to scissor and stretch her out. She sucked onto them hard as she felt pleasure at the movement.</p><p>\u201cYou have two fingers in your ass,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready for my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Severus guided his cock into her pussy first, allowing her to enjoy the feeling of fullness for a moment. He pressed his fingers down and felt his cock through the wall. He just wanted to shag her brains out already.</p><p>He removed himself from her body, leaving her aching and fetched a bottle of lubricant from under the sink. As wet as she was, he knew it wasn\u2019t enough to suffice a proper shag. Thoroughly, he lubed his cock and then her asshole before pressing the tip at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go slow,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and her head turned around to look at him. He gave her a reassuring smile before pushing the tip in slightly. Her eyes closed in bliss and her head turned to face the wall once more.</p><p>Lyra could feel her asshole stretching to accommodate Severus\u2019 thick member. The sensation was unusual, it didn\u2019t feel painful or sensitive, she just felt as though she was being filled. Her ass was swallowing him so quickly and willingly that soon enough he was buried to the hilt.</p><p>Severus groaned as the tight hole swallowed him whole. The amount of friction was maddening, he wanted to move in and out quickly so he could come but he resisted. Instead, he allowed her to accommodate his size and felt her slowly relax under him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep going, alright love?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and with that he pulled out slowly before thrusting back in. He was wrong about the friction being maddening, it was the slow pace that was driving him more insane. It didn\u2019t help that she clenched a bit when he entered.</p><p>\u201cAre you still ok?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s just strange.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him and he had sucked his lips. He nodded at her and continued the tortuous pace. Eventually, her eyes fell shut and moans escaped her. He took it as an indicator to speed up so he did.</p><p>Slowly, he built his pace until it became a regular rhythm. Once he reached it he knew he wasn\u2019t going to last. He had dragged out his orgasm for so long that when it finally hit him the relief was overwhelming. His pelvis jolted forward has he came into her.</p><p>With a pop he slid out and the two rushed into the shower to clean things up.</p><p>~</p><p>It was an odd feeling to be returning to the place she had resigned from only a few months earlier, particularly with her ex-Professor in tow. They had woken up rather early that day, managing to convince Professor Sprout to allow them to drain her Venomous Tentacula of all its venom. Once they had finished at the Greenhouses the two walked past the anti-apparition boundary and apparated to the reception area of St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.</p><p>The Welcome Witch\u2019s eyebrow raised at the sight of the pair. \u201cTrainee Lestrange,\u201d the witch addressed her, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThompson needed some help with the Psyrot cure,\u201d Lyra replied earning a glare from the blonde. \u201cI\u2019ll just be heading to the second floor with Severus.\u201d</p><p>The wizard followed her as she tugged at his bicep, pulling him towards a set of double doors and down a corridor which lead to a set of rickety old stairs. The portraits all seemed to know her and she acted chipper on their ascent as they asked her how she was fairing. They stepped onto the landing of the second floor and Lyra pushed open the set of double doors which had a sign reading MAGICAL BUGS AND DISEASES.</p><p>The ward was completely full. It was obvious that they had magically extended the boundaries of the walls to accomodate more people. Most of the people in the beds were sleeping, no doubt under the effects of Sleeping Draught due to their affliction of Psyrot. Lyra made her way through with a sense of determination towards a group of young wizards in their signature lime-green robes.</p><p>\u201cLyra Lestrange,\u201d a young, brown-haired wizard addressed her. \u201cPleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and repeated the formalities back to the wizard. \u201cPleasure to see you, Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Professor Snape,\u201d the wizard\u2019s arm stretched outwards, knocking Lyra aside in the process, \u00a0offering his hand to Severus. His eyes didn\u2019t even move to acknowledge the gesture, he noticed Lyra grit her teeth at the man and decided that pleasantries weren\u2019t needed.</p><p>He recognised the boy from his years in his class, Jack Thompson. An arrogant Gryffindor that somehow managed to do well in Potions despite blowing up his cauldron in his third year. Severus\u2019 face remained sour before looking down at the wizard\u2019s hand and back up at him. The look was enough to get Jack to retract his hand and nod.</p><p>Jack turned to Lyra, \u201cSo what\u2019s this cure you\u2019ve thought up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenomous Tentacula venom,\u201d she said, pulling an already diluted sample out of her pocket.</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes, \u201cWe want them to live and not be in more discomfort.\u201d</p><p>Lyra gave a very deep and dramatic sigh, \u201cLook let\u2019s just see if it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Jack gestured towards a patient who was very much conscious, looking terrified at the suggestion. Lyra walked towards the frightened man and squatted in front of him, holding his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die from this, you\u2019ll feel a slight burning sensation and possibly a headache but that should pass. Do you consent to this experiment?\u201d</p><p>The man nodded and Lyra stood up, gesturing for Severus to approach. She passed the vial to him and extracted her wand. Tapping the side of his head, non-verbally she cast \u2018Viscera ostende\u2019 twice to reveal the man\u2019s brain. The sight shocked her, his brain was completely covered in worms, eating through the layers of his brain. She was surprised that the man was still upright.</p><p>With a nod to Severus, he heated the contents of the vial with his wand and held it in front of his face. \u201cInhale deeply,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>The patient followed her directions and his head recoiled. Severus stared at the man\u2019s face as tears began to spill from his eyes in reaction to the burning sensation that would be travelling up through his nose. Lyra watched his brain intently for a reaction.</p><p>Her eyes lit up.</p><p>After a few minutes the worms began to just dissolve in reaction to poison that was now in his bloodstream. Lyra wanted to jump up and down in excitement, to scream and throw herself into the arms of the man that she loved but she restrained herself. Instead she just looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>Her former colleagues were watching too, astounded at the effectiveness of the poison. They were quickly put to work in treating the patients, Severus instructing them on how to heat the vial to an evaporative temperature and Lyra watching on for any ill side effects. Severus went around, assisting the staff in administration but his bedside manner couldn\u2019t compare to that of Lyra\u2019s. He watched her in her element, taking care of those in need and he felt his heart grow fonder. Her kind words and gestures made his thoughts wander to what she would be like as a mother. She would be such a wonderful parent but he felt that smile fade as he thought that he would be an inadequate one.</p><p>Hours passed of the healing team administering Lyra\u2019s treatment for Psyrot. There were no ill side effects that had been observed and Lyra prayed that it would remain that way. She didn\u2019t need to be known as the witch who had killed off ill witches and wizards.</p><p>As the day drew to a close,the team of healers began to disperse, leaving Jack with Severus and Lyra whilst the others went to have dinner. The three of them were interrupted by a gang of journalists, bursting through the door. Somehow, word had gotten out that they had discovered the cure and The Daily Prophet wanted to get the exclusive.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d a young blonde woman with perfect curls framing her face had approached the healers, \u201cYou\u2019ve discovered the cure for Psyrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have,\u201d Jack said confidently.</p><p>He peaked the interest of the journalist who extended a hand to him, \u201cI\u2019m Rita Skeeter, I would love to have exclusive publishing rights to your discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d the wizard replied, allowing Rita to whisk him away and sit him down.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed and watched the wizard, curious as to what he was going to say. Her eyes glanced up at Severus who noticed her inquisitive look and both of their eyes watched the man as he was interviewed.</p><p>\u201cSo, what lead to this breakthrough?\u201d Rita asked.</p><p>\u201cI, um,\u201d he began to stumble through his words, \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in discovering the cure since it first showed. I read a lot of books and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rita nodded, jotting everything down on a roll of parchment. \u201cAnd what is the cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTentacula Venom,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked impressed, \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you inhale it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cStill plagiarising other people\u2019s work, I see,\u201d Severus commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you\u2019ve always been such an awful liar.\u201d</p><p>Rita looked disgusted at Severus, \u201cSo you did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Rita\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cA witch discovered the cure to Psyrot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic isn\u2019t just for wizards,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, dear,\u201d the journalist gestured towards the seat next to her. \u201cCome tell me how you discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would much rather have a reputable journalist cover my story,\u201d Lyra replied, her eyes rolled. \u201cTell The Prophet to send someone better next time.\u201d</p><p>Rita huffed out of the room, her gaggle of colleagues following behind her. Severus felt a smirk creep across his lips in pride of what his - what was Lyra to him? His girlfriend? His lover? The pride faded as he stumbled across those words, unsure of the title the girl had in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Jack asked, confronting the Potions Master.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Lyra snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou ruined everything,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI could\u2019ve been-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined everything?\u201d Lyra cut him off, \u201cJack, you\u2019re nothing. You are completely incapable of independent thought and you\u2019re not going to take credit for my work this time. You can fuck right off.\u201d</p><p>Lyra turned around and left, Severus following closely behind. She ran down the stairs and transfigured her clothes as she went, keen to leave St. Mungo\u2019s behind. The two stumbled onto the streets of London and one of Lyra\u2019s hands found its way into Severus\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you wanna go?\u201d she asked him, turning around her eyes darted over the muggle look Severus had donned. She had never seen him in anything other than his usual midnight blue button up robes. He had a white dress shirt on, hidden under a dark blue pullover jumper and black trench coat. She felt her lower lip be sucked in as she took in his look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lovely Italian restaurant near here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she replied, allowing him to pull her towards their destination.</p><p>They arrived to a busy but quaint little eatery in which they had to wait for a table briefly before sitting together in a little private booth.</p><p>\u201cSo is this what you had in mind for our first date?\u201d she asked with a playful tone.</p><p>\u201cIs that your way to trick me into paying for you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not used to eating with muggles,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am actually,\u201d she replied, \u201cI actually used to come here all the time with some of the other trainees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHe was way above that. He wouldn\u2019t get caught in anything less than magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of the relationship between you too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a positive one,\u201d she said before pausing for a moment. Her lips pursed before continuing. \u201cHe\u2019d take credit for my work and it\u2019s rather sexist at the hospital. They wouldn\u2019t believe that I did anything so they\u2019d put me on paperwork whilst he climbed to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah there are a few female Healers but they\u2019re in rather soft positions,\u201d she said, beginning to play with the rim of her water glass. \u201cNothing too high up unless it\u2019s more caring based positions, like my old boss was Miriam Strout who worked in permanent spell damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Longbottoms,\u201d he replied with a grim face.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s jaw clenched and nodded. Conveniently at that point in time they were interrupted by the waitress. They ordered their meals and a bottle of wine before relaxing back into conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat reporter was a real piece of work,\u201d Lura commented, \u201cI\u2019ve read her articles and books. Complete drivel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your plan for world domination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got that all worked out,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cMy friend, Gustav writes for The Wizarding Post . He\u2019s keen for the exclusive, plus the reach of The Post is much larger than The Prophet so it all works out for me.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with a bottle of red and as soon as it started flowing the conversation followed suit. Genuine smiles were seen on the faces of both parties, lighting up Severus\u2019 usual dark demeanour. Any onlooker would\u2019ve seen the couple and guessed that the two had been together for years, there was just an air of familiarity and comfort that hung around them.</p><p>When their food arrived and they were into their meal, Lyra noticed him eyeing her meal and extended a forkful if pasta to him. He followed the same gesture with his meal, Lyra looking deep into his eyes as she took the pasta into her mouth in an attempt to be seductive but she just ended up laughing, not taking herself too seriously.</p><p>The table was cleared and the waitress arrived with the bill. Lyra reached into her pocket to pull out her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d the wizard asked eyeing her carefully as he too was reaching for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying, Sev,\u201d she said as she flicked open the slender pouch and pulled out some muggle money.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said, pulling out his wad of cash.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go halves?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the suggestion but he relented, allowing the witch to pay for her half of the meal. As they left, Lyra\u2019s hand found its way into Severus\u2019 once more. Silently, they wandered the streets and took in the sights. The falling snow and people walking around. It was nice to just be able to walk around and hold the hands of the one you loved without fear of judgement or being found out.</p><p>Lyra glanced over to her partner and caught his eyes. He had been absentmindedly staring at the girl, allowing her to guide him around. She smiled at him before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Severus stopped in his tracks and his hand released the witch\u2019s. He tucked it away into his transfigured coat. With a small sigh he exhaled, \u201cWe\u2019re probably due to go back to Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>Lyra screwed up her nose, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up at the possibilities that unfurled in her mind. \u201cAnywhere as long as it\u2019s with you,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI know a nice hotel,\u201d she winked before her face fell, \u201cBut I think Lucius knows I have a tendency to go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to mine,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cYou have a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go,\u201d she said, afraid she had touched a nerve. \u201cWe can just head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, extending a hand out to her. With no hesitation Lyra took his hand.</p>",

Eventually he gave in to the use of Wideye Potion and took up Lyra\u2019s offer of reading materials, sneaking into her office to browse. There he found her draft report along with the copious amounts of notes she had made over the weeks she had been working on the solution.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He gathered the sheets of parchment and sat himself down near the sleeping witch. Just flicking through the pages was telling. Her messy scrawl covered the pages notating and questioning her own ideas, constantly refining her thoughts. She had made notes of each meetings she had with Kettleburn, Sprout and himself. He took particular interest in her writings of their meetings together, he smiled to himself as he noted the small doodles of animated love hearts that she must\u2019ve absentmindedly drawn as he taught her. In amongst the pages were evidence of her frustrations with herself, times where her brilliant mind had become stuck highlighted by a furious scribble.</p><p>Severus found himself admiring and falling for the witch even more as he saw into her mind. He took a quill and shared his own insights on her draft. He hoped that her research would be successful knowing the effort and soul she poured into it. For a moment his mind flickered and played with the idea of her researching the Dark Arts. If she truly had a passion for it and invested her time into it, the results would be devastating. He shuddered at the thought and looked back down at the girl. He didn\u2019t believe there was a way she would fall back into it.</p><p>The Potions Master returned her papers and browsed her desk for other reading materials. He felt rather nosy shuffling through the drawers. He stumbled across moving photographs of herself with her family, Bellatrix and Rodolphus holding her as a young child then more recent ones of her with the Malfoy\u2019s. What surprised him the most was the fact that she only treasured photos of her family and that there was an obvious absence of images of her friends.</p><p>As he continued to dig through the drawers he revealed letters from her family and friends, her most frequent correspondent being her cousin Draco with short sentences and mundane topics. There were even letters in Russian which he longed to read, afraid that there might be something hidden in the foreign language but he pushed it aside and moved on to her healing textbooks.</p><p>They were thick and full of jargon, annotated by Lyra\u2019s writing in the margins and any empty space available. He flicked through and noticed that the notes were present on every page. He attempted to decipher the meanings but he admitted defeat as he realised that his knowledge of the human body and all its parts wasn\u2019t as vast as the witch\u2019s.</p><p>The books managed to amuse him until 7.30am when Lyra finally stirred from her sleep. She reached out and called him over, \u201cSev, I didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in amusement at the witch\u2019s dramatic tendencies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you,\u201d he said, taking a seat on her bed. \u201cYou\u2019re also not purple so I don\u2019t have to kill you which is nice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and groggily sat up in bed, \u201cHow\u2019d you manage last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went through your notes and draft,\u201d he replied, \u201cI made a few notes myself and then I attempted to read your healing books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are some extra reading materials for more advanced healers,\u201d she said, \u201cI was hoping it\u2019d give me an edge over other trainees when it comes to apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>Severus\u2019 face fell slightly, understanding that she was still playing with the option of leaving. It was far in the future but the prospect of her leaving saddened him as he doubted that once she left Hogwarts she would still want him. \u201cAre you planning on doing that at the end of the school year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she said, her hands interlocking with his, \u201cBut I have a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly but her words and kind touch didn\u2019t seem to bring him any comfort. She seemed to sense this and leaned forward to give him a peck on the cheek before nuzzling into his shoulder. It was nice to have her near but he still had an unsettling feeling almost as though there was a slight possibility that she might not fully be his.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged but he could definitely feel his body begging to rest. \u201cNothing a potion can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of enjoying one another\u2019s company the two had breakfast and proceeded to teach. Severus required two more hits of Wideye to get himself through the day and sent Lyra a note to let her know that he would be retiring early. He prepared himself for bed as soon as the last class finished but was disrupted by the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher knocking on his office door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a smile, sliding into the room. \u201cSorry to disturb you. I\u2019m just letting you know that I might not be around for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said with a hint of shock. He had been looking forward to spending more time with her, preferably when they would both be awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to St. Mungo\u2019s to trial the treatment,\u201d she explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a few people in a real bad way and they\u2019re desperate for a cure. I\u2019ve been owling them all day. I\u2019ve already let Albus know.\u201d</p><p>Severus was not one to wear his heart on his sleeve but the disappointment was apparent on his face. Lyra took his hand, tangling their fingers together and gave him a firm squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIf you want you could come and help out?\u201d she offered, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d</p><p>The sweetness of her words were enough for Severus\u2019 heart to skip a beat. He leaned down so his face was in front of hers and kissed her on the lips. He felt her smile against his lips and she wrapped her arms around him to embrace him. They parted and she was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on just going to bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to grab dinner and spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a date?\u201d she teased with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cTo the teacher\u2019s lounge? You deserve much better than that.\u201d</p><p>Lyra exhaled a laugh and the two exited his office. \u201cShould I take you on a date?\u201d he asked nervously, \u201cI mean, do you want to?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly at the Potions Professor as they walked, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds of silence he nodded, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Happily, the two headed to the staff room for dinner. They ate and conversed with their colleagues, catching one another up on the latest school gossip and beginning to stress about the upcoming exams. Once they had finished they returned to the dungeons.</p><p>\u201cShower then sleep?\u201d Lyra asked as she began to shed her outer layers.</p><p>\u201cDoes shower mean what you usually mean?\u201d Severus smirked.</p><p>Her tongue darted between her lips and a smile formed, \u201cIt can if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said, his arms began to snake around her torso. He lowered his voice and whispered in her ear to finish his sentence, \u201cFor you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she whispered back. His lips pressed against hers and they kissed. Severus\u2019 hand crept up her shirt and groped her, teasing her breasts. Lyra\u2019s hands found themselves hastily undoing his shirt.</p><p>They were naked before they hit the bathroom, their bodies tangled in a kiss with their hands freely roaming one another\u2019s bodies. Severus guided them in and pushed her towards the sink countertop, his hands gripped the backs of her thighs and lifted her up. Their lips managed to stay attached to one another until Severus\u2019 hand dipped down between her legs and his fingers slid in so easily into her pussy.</p><p>With a few pumps in and out Lyra threw her head back moaning and begging, \u201cPlease, Sev, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted to tease her he decided against it. Instead, his hands moved from her pussy to his cock and guided it in. There was a moan of relief heard from both of them as he filled her. Roughly, he fucked her against the countertop, his hands firm on her thighs and hers were buried in his hair and clutching his back.</p><p>His mouth made its mark on her neck as he sucked and bit hard on her exposed flesh. He wanted her to be his and his alone. One of Lyra\u2019s hands reached down between her legs and began to rub herself to orgasm. He could feel her pussy clench down hard onto his member as she longed for her release.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d he asked possessively.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she moaned, \u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev. Fuck, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>A loud moan escaped her as her orgasm came crashing down. She swore more as she rode her orgasm out, her body convulsing as she came down. Once she finally relaxed, Severus pulled out of her and spun her around so she was leaning on the counter, her ass in the air.</p><p>Severus fingers teased her pussy and lubricated themselves with her arousal. He then pressed a single digit against the puckered star the lay higher up and forced his way in. Easily, it caved to the pressure and Lyra gasped at the intrusion. His other hand spread her cheeks and he admired how the tight little star gave way to his finger. Slowly, he pushed past the tight outer ring until it began to swallow it whole. Once he got it to the knuckle he moved it in and out slowly, watching for the woman\u2019s reaction to the new sensation.</p><p>Her eyes were squeezed tightly and small groans of pleasure fell from her tight lips. He continued to finger the hole before whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re still so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck this tight little hole,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt heat pool at the bottom of her stomach at the vulgarity of his words. All she could manage was to hum in response once again.</p><p>\u201cI want to put my cock in your ass, Lyra,\u201d he continued to tease as he noticed the red tint that appeared on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to shag you speechless.\u201d</p><p>She moaned once again but this time it was from the intrusion of his fingers in her pussy. He had two fingers in her pussy and one in her asshole but it didn\u2019t feel like it was enough. She didn\u2019t feel as full as she did with his cock in her.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a greedy little slut, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he commented as he added another finger into her pussy. He could tell she enjoyed that as her walls spasmed at the name calling.</p><p>Another digit joined the single one in her asshole as the fingers in her cunt rocked in and out of her. It was met with some resistance but he took it slowly, wanting her to enjoy the experience. Lyra\u2019s hands were gripping the basin as his fingers fucked her closer to another orgasm.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she moaned out, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come,\u201d he said simply, stopping his movements.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she groaned, trying to shuffle back onto his fingers.</p><p>He was amused to watch her hump herself on his hands, not seeming to get enough friction as she said his name again. His fingers began to thrust in and out as she whispered his name. Quickly, he brought her to orgasm before he pulled his fingers out of her sex, leaving the two in her ass there and held them up to her face.</p><p>\u201cLook at the mess you\u2019ve made,\u201d he said, making her blush even more. \u201cClean it up.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra\u2019s mouth open and took the soaked fingers into her mouth. She lapped up her juices from his hand as the fingers in her ass began to scissor and stretch her out. She sucked onto them hard as she felt pleasure at the movement.</p><p>\u201cYou have two fingers in your ass,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready for my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Severus guided his cock into her pussy first, allowing her to enjoy the feeling of fullness for a moment. He pressed his fingers down and felt his cock through the wall. He just wanted to shag her brains out already.</p><p>He removed himself from her body, leaving her aching and fetched a bottle of lubricant from under the sink. As wet as she was, he knew it wasn\u2019t enough to suffice a proper shag. Thoroughly, he lubed his cock and then her asshole before pressing the tip at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go slow,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and her head turned around to look at him. He gave her a reassuring smile before pushing the tip in slightly. Her eyes closed in bliss and her head turned to face the wall once more.</p><p>Lyra could feel her asshole stretching to accommodate Severus\u2019 thick member. The sensation was unusual, it didn\u2019t feel painful or sensitive, she just felt as though she was being filled. Her ass was swallowing him so quickly and willingly that soon enough he was buried to the hilt.</p><p>Severus groaned as the tight hole swallowed him whole. The amount of friction was maddening, he wanted to move in and out quickly so he could come but he resisted. Instead, he allowed her to accommodate his size and felt her slowly relax under him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep going, alright love?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and with that he pulled out slowly before thrusting back in. He was wrong about the friction being maddening, it was the slow pace that was driving him more insane. It didn\u2019t help that she clenched a bit when he entered.</p><p>\u201cAre you still ok?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s just strange.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him and he had sucked his lips. He nodded at her and continued the tortuous pace. Eventually, her eyes fell shut and moans escaped her. He took it as an indicator to speed up so he did.</p><p>Slowly, he built his pace until it became a regular rhythm. Once he reached it he knew he wasn\u2019t going to last. He had dragged out his orgasm for so long that when it finally hit him the relief was overwhelming. His pelvis jolted forward has he came into her.</p><p>With a pop he slid out and the two rushed into the shower to clean things up.</p><p>~</p><p>It was an odd feeling to be returning to the place she had resigned from only a few months earlier, particularly with her ex-Professor in tow. They had woken up rather early that day, managing to convince Professor Sprout to allow them to drain her Venomous Tentacula of all its venom. Once they had finished at the Greenhouses the two walked past the anti-apparition boundary and apparated to the reception area of St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.</p><p>The Welcome Witch\u2019s eyebrow raised at the sight of the pair. \u201cTrainee Lestrange,\u201d the witch addressed her, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThompson needed some help with the Psyrot cure,\u201d Lyra replied earning a glare from the blonde. \u201cI\u2019ll just be heading to the second floor with Severus.\u201d</p><p>The wizard followed her as she tugged at his bicep, pulling him towards a set of double doors and down a corridor which lead to a set of rickety old stairs. The portraits all seemed to know her and she acted chipper on their ascent as they asked her how she was fairing. They stepped onto the landing of the second floor and Lyra pushed open the set of double doors which had a sign reading MAGICAL BUGS AND DISEASES.</p><p>The ward was completely full. It was obvious that they had magically extended the boundaries of the walls to accomodate more people. Most of the people in the beds were sleeping, no doubt under the effects of Sleeping Draught due to their affliction of Psyrot. Lyra made her way through with a sense of determination towards a group of young wizards in their signature lime-green robes.</p><p>\u201cLyra Lestrange,\u201d a young, brown-haired wizard addressed her. \u201cPleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and repeated the formalities back to the wizard. \u201cPleasure to see you, Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Professor Snape,\u201d the wizard\u2019s arm stretched outwards, knocking Lyra aside in the process, \u00a0offering his hand to Severus. His eyes didn\u2019t even move to acknowledge the gesture, he noticed Lyra grit her teeth at the man and decided that pleasantries weren\u2019t needed.</p><p>He recognised the boy from his years in his class, Jack Thompson. An arrogant Gryffindor that somehow managed to do well in Potions despite blowing up his cauldron in his third year. Severus\u2019 face remained sour before looking down at the wizard\u2019s hand and back up at him. The look was enough to get Jack to retract his hand and nod.</p><p>Jack turned to Lyra, \u201cSo what\u2019s this cure you\u2019ve thought up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenomous Tentacula venom,\u201d she said, pulling an already diluted sample out of her pocket.</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes, \u201cWe want them to live and not be in more discomfort.\u201d</p><p>Lyra gave a very deep and dramatic sigh, \u201cLook let\u2019s just see if it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Jack gestured towards a patient who was very much conscious, looking terrified at the suggestion. Lyra walked towards the frightened man and squatted in front of him, holding his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die from this, you\u2019ll feel a slight burning sensation and possibly a headache but that should pass. Do you consent to this experiment?\u201d</p><p>The man nodded and Lyra stood up, gesturing for Severus to approach. She passed the vial to him and extracted her wand. Tapping the side of his head, non-verbally she cast \u2018Viscera ostende\u2019 twice to reveal the man\u2019s brain. The sight shocked her, his brain was completely covered in worms, eating through the layers of his brain. She was surprised that the man was still upright.</p><p>With a nod to Severus, he heated the contents of the vial with his wand and held it in front of his face. \u201cInhale deeply,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>The patient followed her directions and his head recoiled. Severus stared at the man\u2019s face as tears began to spill from his eyes in reaction to the burning sensation that would be travelling up through his nose. Lyra watched his brain intently for a reaction.</p><p>Her eyes lit up.</p><p>After a few minutes the worms began to just dissolve in reaction to poison that was now in his bloodstream. Lyra wanted to jump up and down in excitement, to scream and throw herself into the arms of the man that she loved but she restrained herself. Instead she just looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>Her former colleagues were watching too, astounded at the effectiveness of the poison. They were quickly put to work in treating the patients, Severus instructing them on how to heat the vial to an evaporative temperature and Lyra watching on for any ill side effects. Severus went around, assisting the staff in administration but his bedside manner couldn\u2019t compare to that of Lyra\u2019s. He watched her in her element, taking care of those in need and he felt his heart grow fonder. Her kind words and gestures made his thoughts wander to what she would be like as a mother. She would be such a wonderful parent but he felt that smile fade as he thought that he would be an inadequate one.</p><p>Hours passed of the healing team administering Lyra\u2019s treatment for Psyrot. There were no ill side effects that had been observed and Lyra prayed that it would remain that way. She didn\u2019t need to be known as the witch who had killed off ill witches and wizards.</p><p>As the day drew to a close,the team of healers began to disperse, leaving Jack with Severus and Lyra whilst the others went to have dinner. The three of them were interrupted by a gang of journalists, bursting through the door. Somehow, word had gotten out that they had discovered the cure and The Daily Prophet wanted to get the exclusive.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d a young blonde woman with perfect curls framing her face had approached the healers, \u201cYou\u2019ve discovered the cure for Psyrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have,\u201d Jack said confidently.</p><p>He peaked the interest of the journalist who extended a hand to him, \u201cI\u2019m Rita Skeeter, I would love to have exclusive publishing rights to your discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d the wizard replied, allowing Rita to whisk him away and sit him down.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed and watched the wizard, curious as to what he was going to say. Her eyes glanced up at Severus who noticed her inquisitive look and both of their eyes watched the man as he was interviewed.</p><p>\u201cSo, what lead to this breakthrough?\u201d Rita asked.</p><p>\u201cI, um,\u201d he began to stumble through his words, \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in discovering the cure since it first showed. I read a lot of books and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rita nodded, jotting everything down on a roll of parchment. \u201cAnd what is the cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTentacula Venom,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked impressed, \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you inhale it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cStill plagiarising other people\u2019s work, I see,\u201d Severus commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you\u2019ve always been such an awful liar.\u201d</p><p>Rita looked disgusted at Severus, \u201cSo you did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Rita\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cA witch discovered the cure to Psyrot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic isn\u2019t just for wizards,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, dear,\u201d the journalist gestured towards the seat next to her. \u201cCome tell me how you discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would much rather have a reputable journalist cover my story,\u201d Lyra replied, her eyes rolled. \u201cTell The Prophet to send someone better next time.\u201d</p><p>Rita huffed out of the room, her gaggle of colleagues following behind her. Severus felt a smirk creep across his lips in pride of what his - what was Lyra to him? His girlfriend? His lover? The pride faded as he stumbled across those words, unsure of the title the girl had in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Jack asked, confronting the Potions Master.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Lyra snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou ruined everything,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI could\u2019ve been-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined everything?\u201d Lyra cut him off, \u201cJack, you\u2019re nothing. You are completely incapable of independent thought and you\u2019re not going to take credit for my work this time. You can fuck right off.\u201d</p><p>Lyra turned around and left, Severus following closely behind. She ran down the stairs and transfigured her clothes as she went, keen to leave St. Mungo\u2019s behind. The two stumbled onto the streets of London and one of Lyra\u2019s hands found its way into Severus\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you wanna go?\u201d she asked him, turning around her eyes darted over the muggle look Severus had donned. She had never seen him in anything other than his usual midnight blue button up robes. He had a white dress shirt on, hidden under a dark blue pullover jumper and black trench coat. She felt her lower lip be sucked in as she took in his look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lovely Italian restaurant near here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she replied, allowing him to pull her towards their destination.</p><p>They arrived to a busy but quaint little eatery in which they had to wait for a table briefly before sitting together in a little private booth.</p><p>\u201cSo is this what you had in mind for our first date?\u201d she asked with a playful tone.</p><p>\u201cIs that your way to trick me into paying for you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not used to eating with muggles,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am actually,\u201d she replied, \u201cI actually used to come here all the time with some of the other trainees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHe was way above that. He wouldn\u2019t get caught in anything less than magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of the relationship between you too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a positive one,\u201d she said before pausing for a moment. Her lips pursed before continuing. \u201cHe\u2019d take credit for my work and it\u2019s rather sexist at the hospital. They wouldn\u2019t believe that I did anything so they\u2019d put me on paperwork whilst he climbed to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah there are a few female Healers but they\u2019re in rather soft positions,\u201d she said, beginning to play with the rim of her water glass. \u201cNothing too high up unless it\u2019s more caring based positions, like my old boss was Miriam Strout who worked in permanent spell damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Longbottoms,\u201d he replied with a grim face.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s jaw clenched and nodded. Conveniently at that point in time they were interrupted by the waitress. They ordered their meals and a bottle of wine before relaxing back into conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat reporter was a real piece of work,\u201d Lura commented, \u201cI\u2019ve read her articles and books. Complete drivel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your plan for world domination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got that all worked out,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cMy friend, Gustav writes for The Wizarding Post . He\u2019s keen for the exclusive, plus the reach of The Post is much larger than The Prophet so it all works out for me.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with a bottle of red and as soon as it started flowing the conversation followed suit. Genuine smiles were seen on the faces of both parties, lighting up Severus\u2019 usual dark demeanour. Any onlooker would\u2019ve seen the couple and guessed that the two had been together for years, there was just an air of familiarity and comfort that hung around them.</p><p>When their food arrived and they were into their meal, Lyra noticed him eyeing her meal and extended a forkful if pasta to him. He followed the same gesture with his meal, Lyra looking deep into his eyes as she took the pasta into her mouth in an attempt to be seductive but she just ended up laughing, not taking herself too seriously.</p><p>The table was cleared and the waitress arrived with the bill. Lyra reached into her pocket to pull out her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d the wizard asked eyeing her carefully as he too was reaching for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying, Sev,\u201d she said as she flicked open the slender pouch and pulled out some muggle money.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said, pulling out his wad of cash.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go halves?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the suggestion but he relented, allowing the witch to pay for her half of the meal. As they left, Lyra\u2019s hand found its way into Severus\u2019 once more. Silently, they wandered the streets and took in the sights. The falling snow and people walking around. It was nice to just be able to walk around and hold the hands of the one you loved without fear of judgement or being found out.</p><p>Lyra glanced over to her partner and caught his eyes. He had been absentmindedly staring at the girl, allowing her to guide him around. She smiled at him before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Severus stopped in his tracks and his hand released the witch\u2019s. He tucked it away into his transfigured coat. With a small sigh he exhaled, \u201cWe\u2019re probably due to go back to Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>Lyra screwed up her nose, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up at the possibilities that unfurled in her mind. \u201cAnywhere as long as it\u2019s with you,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI know a nice hotel,\u201d she winked before her face fell, \u201cBut I think Lucius knows I have a tendency to go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to mine,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cYou have a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go,\u201d she said, afraid she had touched a nerve. \u201cWe can just head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, extending a hand out to her. With no hesitation Lyra took his hand.</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange\u2019s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves.

From his extensive knowledge of potions and poisons he suspected that the witch would be fine but one hand remained firmly in his pocket clutching a bezoar on the slim chance that he was wrong. Every so often his eyes would glance downwards to check that she was still breathing, usually drawn by her stirring in her sleep.</p><p>Severus\u2019 eyes grew heavy as the night passed. The steadiness of Lyra\u2019s breath tempted him to sleep but he found himself on his feet pacing, keeping his blood circulating to keep himself awake. Eventually he gave in to the use of Wideye Potion and took up Lyra\u2019s offer of reading materials, sneaking into her office to browse. There he found her draft report along with the copious amounts of notes she had made over the weeks she had been working on the solution.</p>[[MORE]]<p>He gathered the sheets of parchment and sat himself down near the sleeping witch. Just flicking through the pages was telling. Her messy scrawl covered the pages notating and questioning her own ideas, constantly refining her thoughts. She had made notes of each meetings she had with Kettleburn, Sprout and himself. He took particular interest in her writings of their meetings together, he smiled to himself as he noted the small doodles of animated love hearts that she must\u2019ve absentmindedly drawn as he taught her. In amongst the pages were evidence of her frustrations with herself, times where her brilliant mind had become stuck highlighted by a furious scribble.</p><p>Severus found himself admiring and falling for the witch even more as he saw into her mind. He took a quill and shared his own insights on her draft. He hoped that her research would be successful knowing the effort and soul she poured into it. For a moment his mind flickered and played with the idea of her researching the Dark Arts. If she truly had a passion for it and invested her time into it, the results would be devastating. He shuddered at the thought and looked back down at the girl. He didn\u2019t believe there was a way she would fall back into it.</p><p>The Potions Master returned her papers and browsed her desk for other reading materials. He felt rather nosy shuffling through the drawers. He stumbled across moving photographs of herself with her family, Bellatrix and Rodolphus holding her as a young child then more recent ones of her with the Malfoy\u2019s. What surprised him the most was the fact that she only treasured photos of her family and that there was an obvious absence of images of her friends.</p><p>As he continued to dig through the drawers he revealed letters from her family and friends, her most frequent correspondent being her cousin Draco with short sentences and mundane topics. There were even letters in Russian which he longed to read, afraid that there might be something hidden in the foreign language but he pushed it aside and moved on to her healing textbooks.</p><p>They were thick and full of jargon, annotated by Lyra\u2019s writing in the margins and any empty space available. He flicked through and noticed that the notes were present on every page. He attempted to decipher the meanings but he admitted defeat as he realised that his knowledge of the human body and all its parts wasn\u2019t as vast as the witch\u2019s.</p><p>The books managed to amuse him until 7.30am when Lyra finally stirred from her sleep. She reached out and called him over, \u201cSev, I didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in amusement at the witch\u2019s dramatic tendencies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you,\u201d he said, taking a seat on her bed. \u201cYou\u2019re also not purple so I don\u2019t have to kill you which is nice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back and groggily sat up in bed, \u201cHow\u2019d you manage last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went through your notes and draft,\u201d he replied, \u201cI made a few notes myself and then I attempted to read your healing books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are some extra reading materials for more advanced healers,\u201d she said, \u201cI was hoping it\u2019d give me an edge over other trainees when it comes to apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>Severus\u2019 face fell slightly, understanding that she was still playing with the option of leaving. It was far in the future but the prospect of her leaving saddened him as he doubted that once she left Hogwarts she would still want him. \u201cAre you planning on doing that at the end of the school year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she said, her hands interlocking with his, \u201cBut I have a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly but her words and kind touch didn\u2019t seem to bring him any comfort. She seemed to sense this and leaned forward to give him a peck on the cheek before nuzzling into his shoulder. It was nice to have her near but he still had an unsettling feeling almost as though there was a slight possibility that she might not fully be his.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged but he could definitely feel his body begging to rest. \u201cNothing a potion can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments of enjoying one another\u2019s company the two had breakfast and proceeded to teach. Severus required two more hits of Wideye to get himself through the day and sent Lyra a note to let her know that he would be retiring early. He prepared himself for bed as soon as the last class finished but was disrupted by the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher knocking on his office door.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a smile, sliding into the room. \u201cSorry to disturb you. I\u2019m just letting you know that I might not be around for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said with a hint of shock. He had been looking forward to spending more time with her, preferably when they would both be awake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to St. Mungo\u2019s to trial the treatment,\u201d she explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a few people in a real bad way and they\u2019re desperate for a cure. I\u2019ve been owling them all day. I\u2019ve already let Albus know.\u201d</p><p>Severus was not one to wear his heart on his sleeve but the disappointment was apparent on his face. Lyra took his hand, tangling their fingers together and gave him a firm squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIf you want you could come and help out?\u201d she offered, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d</p><p>The sweetness of her words were enough for Severus\u2019 heart to skip a beat. He leaned down so his face was in front of hers and kissed her on the lips. He felt her smile against his lips and she wrapped her arms around him to embrace him. They parted and she was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was planning on just going to bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want to grab dinner and spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a date?\u201d she teased with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cTo the teacher\u2019s lounge? You deserve much better than that.\u201d</p><p>Lyra exhaled a laugh and the two exited his office. \u201cShould I take you on a date?\u201d he asked nervously, \u201cI mean, do you want to?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly at the Potions Professor as they walked, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds of silence he nodded, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Happily, the two headed to the staff room for dinner. They ate and conversed with their colleagues, catching one another up on the latest school gossip and beginning to stress about the upcoming exams. Once they had finished they returned to the dungeons.</p><p>\u201cShower then sleep?\u201d Lyra asked as she began to shed her outer layers.</p><p>\u201cDoes shower mean what you usually mean?\u201d Severus smirked.</p><p>Her tongue darted between her lips and a smile formed, \u201cIt can if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said, his arms began to snake around her torso. He lowered his voice and whispered in her ear to finish his sentence, \u201cFor you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she whispered back. His lips pressed against hers and they kissed. Severus\u2019 hand crept up her shirt and groped her, teasing her breasts. Lyra\u2019s hands found themselves hastily undoing his shirt.</p><p>They were naked before they hit the bathroom, their bodies tangled in a kiss with their hands freely roaming one another\u2019s bodies. Severus guided them in and pushed her towards the sink countertop, his hands gripped the backs of her thighs and lifted her up. Their lips managed to stay attached to one another until Severus\u2019 hand dipped down between her legs and his fingers slid in so easily into her pussy.</p><p>With a few pumps in and out Lyra threw her head back moaning and begging, \u201cPlease, Sev, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted to tease her he decided against it. Instead, his hands moved from her pussy to his cock and guided it in. There was a moan of relief heard from both of them as he filled her. Roughly, he fucked her against the countertop, his hands firm on her thighs and hers were buried in his hair and clutching his back.</p><p>His mouth made its mark on her neck as he sucked and bit hard on her exposed flesh. He wanted her to be his and his alone. One of Lyra\u2019s hands reached down between her legs and began to rub herself to orgasm. He could feel her pussy clench down hard onto his member as she longed for her release.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she breathed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d he asked possessively.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she moaned, \u201cI\u2019m yours, Sev. Fuck, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>A loud moan escaped her as her orgasm came crashing down. She swore more as she rode her orgasm out, her body convulsing as she came down. Once she finally relaxed, Severus pulled out of her and spun her around so she was leaning on the counter, her ass in the air.</p><p>Severus fingers teased her pussy and lubricated themselves with her arousal. He then pressed a single digit against the puckered star the lay higher up and forced his way in. Easily, it caved to the pressure and Lyra gasped at the intrusion. His other hand spread her cheeks and he admired how the tight little star gave way to his finger. Slowly, he pushed past the tight outer ring until it began to swallow it whole. Once he got it to the knuckle he moved it in and out slowly, watching for the woman\u2019s reaction to the new sensation.</p><p>Her eyes were squeezed tightly and small groans of pleasure fell from her tight lips. He continued to finger the hole before whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re still so tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she hummed.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck this tight little hole,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt heat pool at the bottom of her stomach at the vulgarity of his words. All she could manage was to hum in response once again.</p><p>\u201cI want to put my cock in your ass, Lyra,\u201d he continued to tease as he noticed the red tint that appeared on her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to shag you speechless.\u201d</p><p>She moaned once again but this time it was from the intrusion of his fingers in her pussy. He had two fingers in her pussy and one in her asshole but it didn\u2019t feel like it was enough. She didn\u2019t feel as full as she did with his cock in her.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a greedy little slut, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he commented as he added another finger into her pussy. He could tell she enjoyed that as her walls spasmed at the name calling.</p><p>Another digit joined the single one in her asshole as the fingers in her cunt rocked in and out of her. It was met with some resistance but he took it slowly, wanting her to enjoy the experience. Lyra\u2019s hands were gripping the basin as his fingers fucked her closer to another orgasm.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she moaned out, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come,\u201d he said simply, stopping his movements.</p><p>\u201cSev,\u201d she groaned, trying to shuffle back onto his fingers.</p><p>He was amused to watch her hump herself on his hands, not seeming to get enough friction as she said his name again. His fingers began to thrust in and out as she whispered his name. Quickly, he brought her to orgasm before he pulled his fingers out of her sex, leaving the two in her ass there and held them up to her face.</p><p>\u201cLook at the mess you\u2019ve made,\u201d he said, making her blush even more. \u201cClean it up.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra\u2019s mouth open and took the soaked fingers into her mouth. She lapped up her juices from his hand as the fingers in her ass began to scissor and stretch her out. She sucked onto them hard as she felt pleasure at the movement.</p><p>\u201cYou have two fingers in your ass,\u201d he said, \u201cDo you think you\u2019re ready for my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Severus guided his cock into her pussy first, allowing her to enjoy the feeling of fullness for a moment. He pressed his fingers down and felt his cock through the wall. He just wanted to shag her brains out already.</p><p>He removed himself from her body, leaving her aching and fetched a bottle of lubricant from under the sink. As wet as she was, he knew it wasn\u2019t enough to suffice a proper shag. Thoroughly, he lubed his cock and then her asshole before pressing the tip at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go slow,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and her head turned around to look at him. He gave her a reassuring smile before pushing the tip in slightly. Her eyes closed in bliss and her head turned to face the wall once more.</p><p>Lyra could feel her asshole stretching to accommodate Severus\u2019 thick member. The sensation was unusual, it didn\u2019t feel painful or sensitive, she just felt as though she was being filled. Her ass was swallowing him so quickly and willingly that soon enough he was buried to the hilt.</p><p>Severus groaned as the tight hole swallowed him whole. The amount of friction was maddening, he wanted to move in and out quickly so he could come but he resisted. Instead, he allowed her to accommodate his size and felt her slowly relax under him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to keep going, alright love?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded and with that he pulled out slowly before thrusting back in. He was wrong about the friction being maddening, it was the slow pace that was driving him more insane. It didn\u2019t help that she clenched a bit when he entered.</p><p>\u201cAre you still ok?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s just strange.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him and he had sucked his lips. He nodded at her and continued the tortuous pace. Eventually, her eyes fell shut and moans escaped her. He took it as an indicator to speed up so he did.</p><p>Slowly, he built his pace until it became a regular rhythm. Once he reached it he knew he wasn\u2019t going to last. He had dragged out his orgasm for so long that when it finally hit him the relief was overwhelming. His pelvis jolted forward has he came into her.</p><p>With a pop he slid out and the two rushed into the shower to clean things up.</p><p>~</p><p>It was an odd feeling to be returning to the place she had resigned from only a few months earlier, particularly with her ex-Professor in tow. They had woken up rather early that day, managing to convince Professor Sprout to allow them to drain her Venomous Tentacula of all its venom. Once they had finished at the Greenhouses the two walked past the anti-apparition boundary and apparated to the reception area of St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.</p><p>The Welcome Witch\u2019s eyebrow raised at the sight of the pair. \u201cTrainee Lestrange,\u201d the witch addressed her, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThompson needed some help with the Psyrot cure,\u201d Lyra replied earning a glare from the blonde. \u201cI\u2019ll just be heading to the second floor with Severus.\u201d</p><p>The wizard followed her as she tugged at his bicep, pulling him towards a set of double doors and down a corridor which lead to a set of rickety old stairs. The portraits all seemed to know her and she acted chipper on their ascent as they asked her how she was fairing. They stepped onto the landing of the second floor and Lyra pushed open the set of double doors which had a sign reading MAGICAL BUGS AND DISEASES.</p><p>The ward was completely full. It was obvious that they had magically extended the boundaries of the walls to accomodate more people. Most of the people in the beds were sleeping, no doubt under the effects of Sleeping Draught due to their affliction of Psyrot. Lyra made her way through with a sense of determination towards a group of young wizards in their signature lime-green robes.</p><p>\u201cLyra Lestrange,\u201d a young, brown-haired wizard addressed her. \u201cPleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and repeated the formalities back to the wizard. \u201cPleasure to see you, Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Professor Snape,\u201d the wizard\u2019s arm stretched outwards, knocking Lyra aside in the process, \u00a0offering his hand to Severus. His eyes didn\u2019t even move to acknowledge the gesture, he noticed Lyra grit her teeth at the man and decided that pleasantries weren\u2019t needed.</p><p>He recognised the boy from his years in his class, Jack Thompson. An arrogant Gryffindor that somehow managed to do well in Potions despite blowing up his cauldron in his third year. Severus\u2019 face remained sour before looking down at the wizard\u2019s hand and back up at him. The look was enough to get Jack to retract his hand and nod.</p><p>Jack turned to Lyra, \u201cSo what\u2019s this cure you\u2019ve thought up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenomous Tentacula venom,\u201d she said, pulling an already diluted sample out of her pocket.</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes, \u201cWe want them to live and not be in more discomfort.\u201d</p><p>Lyra gave a very deep and dramatic sigh, \u201cLook let\u2019s just see if it\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Jack gestured towards a patient who was very much conscious, looking terrified at the suggestion. Lyra walked towards the frightened man and squatted in front of him, holding his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die from this, you\u2019ll feel a slight burning sensation and possibly a headache but that should pass. Do you consent to this experiment?\u201d</p><p>The man nodded and Lyra stood up, gesturing for Severus to approach. She passed the vial to him and extracted her wand. Tapping the side of his head, non-verbally she cast \u2018Viscera ostende\u2019 twice to reveal the man\u2019s brain. The sight shocked her, his brain was completely covered in worms, eating through the layers of his brain. She was surprised that the man was still upright.</p><p>With a nod to Severus, he heated the contents of the vial with his wand and held it in front of his face. \u201cInhale deeply,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>The patient followed her directions and his head recoiled. Severus stared at the man\u2019s face as tears began to spill from his eyes in reaction to the burning sensation that would be travelling up through his nose. Lyra watched his brain intently for a reaction.</p><p>Her eyes lit up.</p><p>After a few minutes the worms began to just dissolve in reaction to poison that was now in his bloodstream. Lyra wanted to jump up and down in excitement, to scream and throw herself into the arms of the man that she loved but she restrained herself. Instead she just looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>Her former colleagues were watching too, astounded at the effectiveness of the poison. They were quickly put to work in treating the patients, Severus instructing them on how to heat the vial to an evaporative temperature and Lyra watching on for any ill side effects. Severus went around, assisting the staff in administration but his bedside manner couldn\u2019t compare to that of Lyra\u2019s. He watched her in her element, taking care of those in need and he felt his heart grow fonder. Her kind words and gestures made his thoughts wander to what she would be like as a mother. She would be such a wonderful parent but he felt that smile fade as he thought that he would be an inadequate one.</p><p>Hours passed of the healing team administering Lyra\u2019s treatment for Psyrot. There were no ill side effects that had been observed and Lyra prayed that it would remain that way. She didn\u2019t need to be known as the witch who had killed off ill witches and wizards.</p><p>As the day drew to a close,the team of healers began to disperse, leaving Jack with Severus and Lyra whilst the others went to have dinner. The three of them were interrupted by a gang of journalists, bursting through the door. Somehow, word had gotten out that they had discovered the cure and The Daily Prophet wanted to get the exclusive.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d a young blonde woman with perfect curls framing her face had approached the healers, \u201cYou\u2019ve discovered the cure for Psyrot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we have,\u201d Jack said confidently.</p><p>He peaked the interest of the journalist who extended a hand to him, \u201cI\u2019m Rita Skeeter, I would love to have exclusive publishing rights to your discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d the wizard replied, allowing Rita to whisk him away and sit him down.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s eyes narrowed and watched the wizard, curious as to what he was going to say. Her eyes glanced up at Severus who noticed her inquisitive look and both of their eyes watched the man as he was interviewed.</p><p>\u201cSo, what lead to this breakthrough?\u201d Rita asked.</p><p>\u201cI, um,\u201d he began to stumble through his words, \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in discovering the cure since it first showed. I read a lot of books and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Rita nodded, jotting everything down on a roll of parchment. \u201cAnd what is the cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTentacula Venom,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked impressed, \u201cHow did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you inhale it,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cStill plagiarising other people\u2019s work, I see,\u201d Severus commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you\u2019ve always been such an awful liar.\u201d</p><p>Rita looked disgusted at Severus, \u201cSo you did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lyra said.</p><p>Rita\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cA witch discovered the cure to Psyrot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic isn\u2019t just for wizards,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, dear,\u201d the journalist gestured towards the seat next to her. \u201cCome tell me how you discovered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would much rather have a reputable journalist cover my story,\u201d Lyra replied, her eyes rolled. \u201cTell The Prophet to send someone better next time.\u201d</p><p>Rita huffed out of the room, her gaggle of colleagues following behind her. Severus felt a smirk creep across his lips in pride of what his - what was Lyra to him? His girlfriend? His lover? The pride faded as he stumbled across those words, unsure of the title the girl had in his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d Jack asked, confronting the Potions Master.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Lyra snorted.</p><p>\u201cYou ruined everything,\u201d Jack said, \u201cI could\u2019ve been-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ruined everything?\u201d Lyra cut him off, \u201cJack, you\u2019re nothing. You are completely incapable of independent thought and you\u2019re not going to take credit for my work this time. You can fuck right off.\u201d</p><p>Lyra turned around and left, Severus following closely behind. She ran down the stairs and transfigured her clothes as she went, keen to leave St. Mungo\u2019s behind. The two stumbled onto the streets of London and one of Lyra\u2019s hands found its way into Severus\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you wanna go?\u201d she asked him, turning around her eyes darted over the muggle look Severus had donned. She had never seen him in anything other than his usual midnight blue button up robes. He had a white dress shirt on, hidden under a dark blue pullover jumper and black trench coat. She felt her lower lip be sucked in as she took in his look.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lovely Italian restaurant near here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she replied, allowing him to pull her towards their destination.</p><p>They arrived to a busy but quaint little eatery in which they had to wait for a table briefly before sitting together in a little private booth.</p><p>\u201cSo is this what you had in mind for our first date?\u201d she asked with a playful tone.</p><p>\u201cIs that your way to trick me into paying for you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not used to eating with muggles,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am actually,\u201d she replied, \u201cI actually used to come here all the time with some of the other trainees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cHe was way above that. He wouldn\u2019t get caught in anything less than magical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the nature of the relationship between you too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a positive one,\u201d she said before pausing for a moment. Her lips pursed before continuing. \u201cHe\u2019d take credit for my work and it\u2019s rather sexist at the hospital. They wouldn\u2019t believe that I did anything so they\u2019d put me on paperwork whilst he climbed to the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, yeah there are a few female Healers but they\u2019re in rather soft positions,\u201d she said, beginning to play with the rim of her water glass. \u201cNothing too high up unless it\u2019s more caring based positions, like my old boss was Miriam Strout who worked in permanent spell damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Longbottoms,\u201d he replied with a grim face.</p><p>Lyra\u2019s jaw clenched and nodded. Conveniently at that point in time they were interrupted by the waitress. They ordered their meals and a bottle of wine before relaxing back into conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat reporter was a real piece of work,\u201d Lura commented, \u201cI\u2019ve read her articles and books. Complete drivel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your plan for world domination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got that all worked out,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cMy friend, Gustav writes for The Wizarding Post . He\u2019s keen for the exclusive, plus the reach of The Post is much larger than The Prophet so it all works out for me.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived with a bottle of red and as soon as it started flowing the conversation followed suit. Genuine smiles were seen on the faces of both parties, lighting up Severus\u2019 usual dark demeanour. Any onlooker would\u2019ve seen the couple and guessed that the two had been together for years, there was just an air of familiarity and comfort that hung around them.</p><p>When their food arrived and they were into their meal, Lyra noticed him eyeing her meal and extended a forkful if pasta to him. He followed the same gesture with his meal, Lyra looking deep into his eyes as she took the pasta into her mouth in an attempt to be seductive but she just ended up laughing, not taking herself too seriously.</p><p>The table was cleared and the waitress arrived with the bill. Lyra reached into her pocket to pull out her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d the wizard asked eyeing her carefully as he too was reaching for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying, Sev,\u201d she said as she flicked open the slender pouch and pulled out some muggle money.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said, pulling out his wad of cash.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go halves?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the suggestion but he relented, allowing the witch to pay for her half of the meal. As they left, Lyra\u2019s hand found its way into Severus\u2019 once more. Silently, they wandered the streets and took in the sights. The falling snow and people walking around. It was nice to just be able to walk around and hold the hands of the one you loved without fear of judgement or being found out.</p><p>Lyra glanced over to her partner and caught his eyes. He had been absentmindedly staring at the girl, allowing her to guide him around. She smiled at him before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>Severus stopped in his tracks and his hand released the witch\u2019s. He tucked it away into his transfigured coat. With a small sigh he exhaled, \u201cWe\u2019re probably due to go back to Hogwarts.\u201d</p><p>Lyra screwed up her nose, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be back until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up at the possibilities that unfurled in her mind. \u201cAnywhere as long as it\u2019s with you,\u201d she grinned. \u201cI know a nice hotel,\u201d she winked before her face fell, \u201cBut I think Lucius knows I have a tendency to go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go back to mine,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cYou have a place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go,\u201d she said, afraid she had touched a nerve. \u201cWe can just head back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, extending a hand out to her. With no hesitation Lyra took his hand.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>Summary:&nbsp;The daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange is a Healer who finds herself not only haunted by her past but also questioning her choice in career. When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p><p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p><p><i><b>Word Count: </b>4858</i></p><p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p><p><b>Chapter Eighteen - Administration</b></p><p>Somehow, Severus managed to keep himself up through the night to ensure that Lyra survived the dose of venomous tentacula juice. From his extensive knowledge of potions and poisons he suspected that the witch would be fine but one hand remained firmly in his pocket clutching a bezoar on the slim chance that he was wrong. Every so often his eyes would glance downwards to check that she was still breathing, usually drawn by her stirring in her sleep.</p><p>Severus&rsquo; eyes grew heavy as the night passed. The steadiness of Lyra&rsquo;s breath tempted him to sleep but he found himself on his feet pacing, keeping his blood circulating to keep himself awake. Eventually he gave in to the use of Wideye Potion and took up Lyra&rsquo;s offer of reading materials, sneaking into her office to browse. There he found her draft report along with the copious amounts of notes she had made over the weeks she had been working on the solution.</p><p>He gathered the sheets of parchment and sat himself down near the sleeping witch. Just flicking through the pages was telling. Her messy scrawl covered the pages notating and questioning her own ideas, constantly refining her thoughts. She had made notes of each meetings she had with Kettleburn, Sprout and himself. He took particular interest in her writings of their meetings together, he smiled to himself as he noted the small doodles of animated love hearts that she must&rsquo;ve absentmindedly drawn as he taught her. In amongst the pages were evidence of her frustrations with herself, times where her brilliant mind had become stuck highlighted by a furious scribble.</p><p>Severus found himself admiring and falling for the witch even more as he saw into her mind. He took a quill and shared his own insights on her draft. He hoped that her research would be successful knowing the effort and soul she poured into it. For a moment his mind flickered and played with the idea of her researching the Dark Arts. If she truly had a passion for it and invested her time into it, the results would be devastating. He shuddered at the thought and looked back down at the girl. He didn&rsquo;t believe there was a way she would fall back into it.</p><p>The Potions Master returned her papers and browsed her desk for other reading materials. He felt rather nosy shuffling through the drawers. He stumbled across moving photographs of herself with her family, Bellatrix and Rodolphus holding her as a young child then more recent ones of her with the Malfoy&rsquo;s. What surprised him the most was the fact that she only treasured photos of her family and that there was an obvious absence of images of her friends.</p><p>As he continued to dig through the drawers he revealed letters from her family and friends, her most frequent correspondent being her cousin Draco with short sentences and mundane topics. There were even letters in Russian which he longed to read, afraid that there might be something hidden in the foreign language but he pushed it aside and moved on to her healing textbooks.</p><p>They were thick and full of jargon, annotated by Lyra&rsquo;s writing in the margins and any empty space available. He flicked through and noticed that the notes were present on every page. He attempted to decipher the meanings but he admitted defeat as he realised that his knowledge of the human body and all its parts wasn&rsquo;t as vast as the witch&rsquo;s.</p><p>The books managed to amuse him until 7.30am when Lyra finally stirred from her sleep. She reached out and called him over, &ldquo;Sev, I didn&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled in amusement at the witch&rsquo;s dramatic tendencies. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; he said, taking a seat on her bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re also not purple so I don&rsquo;t have to kill you which is nice.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled back and groggily sat up in bed, &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you manage last night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I went through your notes and draft,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I made a few notes myself and then I attempted to read your healing books.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those are some extra reading materials for more advanced healers,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was hoping it&rsquo;d give me an edge over other trainees when it comes to apprenticeship.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus&rsquo; face fell slightly, understanding that she was still playing with the option of leaving. It was far in the future but the prospect of her leaving saddened him as he doubted that once she left Hogwarts she would still want him. &ldquo;Are you planning on doing that at the end of the school year?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; she said, her hands interlocking with his, &ldquo;But I have a reason to stay.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled faintly but her words and kind touch didn&rsquo;t seem to bring him any comfort. She seemed to sense this and leaned forward to give him a peck on the cheek before nuzzling into his shoulder. It was nice to have her near but he still had an unsettling feeling almost as though there was a slight possibility that she might not fully be his.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>He shrugged but he could definitely feel his body begging to rest. &ldquo;Nothing a potion can&rsquo;t fix.&rdquo;</p><p>After a few moments of enjoying one another&rsquo;s company the two had breakfast and proceeded to teach. Severus required two more hits of Wideye to get himself through the day and sent Lyra a note to let her know that he would be retiring early. He prepared himself for bed as soon as the last class finished but was disrupted by the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher knocking on his office door.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said with a smile, sliding into the room. &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you. I&rsquo;m just letting you know that I might not be around for the weekend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; he said with a hint of shock. He had been looking forward to spending more time with her, preferably when they would both be awake.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heading to St. Mungo&rsquo;s to trial the treatment,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a few people in a real bad way and they&rsquo;re desperate for a cure. I&rsquo;ve been owling them all day. I&rsquo;ve already let Albus know.&rdquo;</p><p>Severus was not one to wear his heart on his sleeve but the disappointment was apparent on his face. Lyra took his hand, tangling their fingers together and gave him a firm squeeze.</p><p>&ldquo;If you want you could come and help out?&rdquo; she offered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving until the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You want me to come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.&rdquo;</p><p>The sweetness of her words were enough for Severus&rsquo; heart to skip a beat. He leaned down so his face was in front of hers and kissed her on the lips. He felt her smile against his lips and she wrapped her arms around him to embrace him. They parted and she was still smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you eaten?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I was planning on just going to bed,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you want to grab dinner and spend the night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that a date?&rdquo; she teased with a smirk.</p><p>&ldquo;To the teacher&rsquo;s lounge? You deserve much better than that.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra exhaled a laugh and the two exited his office. &ldquo;Should I take you on a date?&rdquo; he asked nervously, &ldquo;I mean, do you want to?&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled sweetly at the Potions Professor as they walked, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p>After a few seconds of silence he nodded, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>Happily, the two headed to the staff room for dinner. They ate and conversed with their colleagues, catching one another up on the latest school gossip and beginning to stress about the upcoming exams. Once they had finished they returned to the dungeons.</p><p>&ldquo;Shower then sleep?&rdquo; Lyra asked as she began to shed her outer layers.</p><p>&ldquo;Does shower mean what you usually mean?&rdquo; Severus smirked.</p><p>Her tongue darted between her lips and a smile formed, &ldquo;It can if you wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, his arms began to snake around her torso. He lowered his voice and whispered in her ear to finish his sentence, &ldquo;For you to be mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours,&rdquo; she whispered back. His lips pressed against hers and they kissed. Severus&rsquo; hand crept up her shirt and groped her, teasing her breasts. Lyra&rsquo;s hands found themselves hastily undoing his shirt.</p><p>They were naked before they hit the bathroom, their bodies tangled in a kiss with their hands freely roaming one another&rsquo;s bodies. Severus guided them in and pushed her towards the sink countertop, his hands gripped the backs of her thighs and lifted her up. Their lips managed to stay attached to one another until Severus&rsquo; hand dipped down between her legs and his fingers slid in so easily into her pussy.</p><p>With a few pumps in and out Lyra threw her head back moaning and begging, &ldquo;Please, Sev, just fuck me.&rdquo;</p><p>As much as he wanted to tease her he decided against it. Instead, his hands moved from her pussy to his cock and guided it in. There was a moan of relief heard from both of them as he filled her. Roughly, he fucked her against the countertop, his hands firm on her thighs and hers were buried in his hair and clutching his back.</p><p>His mouth made its mark on her neck as he sucked and bit hard on her exposed flesh. He wanted her to be his and his alone. One of Lyra&rsquo;s hands reached down between her legs and began to rub herself to orgasm. He could feel her pussy clench down hard onto his member as she longed for her release.</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who do you belong to?&rdquo; he asked possessively.</p><p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours, Sev. Fuck, I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come for me,&rdquo; he growled.</p><p>A loud moan escaped her as her orgasm came crashing down. She swore more as she rode her orgasm out, her body convulsing as she came down. Once she finally relaxed, Severus pulled out of her and spun her around so she was leaning on the counter, her ass in the air.</p><p>Severus fingers teased her pussy and lubricated themselves with her arousal. He then pressed a single digit against the puckered star the lay higher up and forced his way in. Easily, it caved to the pressure and Lyra gasped at the intrusion. His other hand spread her cheeks and he admired how the tight little star gave way to his finger. Slowly, he pushed past the tight outer ring until it began to swallow it whole. Once he got it to the knuckle he moved it in and out slowly, watching for the woman&rsquo;s reaction to the new sensation.</p><p>Her eyes were squeezed tightly and small groans of pleasure fell from her tight lips. He continued to finger the hole before whispering, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still so tight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; she hummed.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to fuck this tight little hole,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She felt heat pool at the bottom of her stomach at the vulgarity of his words. All she could manage was to hum in response once again.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to put my cock in your ass, Lyra,&rdquo; he continued to tease as he noticed the red tint that appeared on her cheeks. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to shag you speechless.&rdquo;</p><p>She moaned once again but this time it was from the intrusion of his fingers in her pussy. He had two fingers in her pussy and one in her asshole but it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was enough. She didn&rsquo;t feel as full as she did with his cock in her.</p><p>&ldquo;More,&rdquo; she begged.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a greedy little slut, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he commented as he added another finger into her pussy. He could tell she enjoyed that as her walls spasmed at the name calling.</p><p>Another digit joined the single one in her asshole as the fingers in her cunt rocked in and out of her. It was met with some resistance but he took it slowly, wanting her to enjoy the experience. Lyra&rsquo;s hands were gripping the basin as his fingers fucked her closer to another orgasm.</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she moaned out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to make me come again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then come,&rdquo; he said simply, stopping his movements.</p><p>&ldquo;Sev,&rdquo; she groaned, trying to shuffle back onto his fingers.</p><p>He was amused to watch her hump herself on his hands, not seeming to get enough friction as she said his name again. His fingers began to thrust in and out as she whispered his name. Quickly, he brought her to orgasm before he pulled his fingers out of her sex, leaving the two in her ass there and held them up to her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at the mess you&rsquo;ve made,&rdquo; he said, making her blush even more. &ldquo;Clean it up.&rdquo;</p><p>Hesitantly, Lyra&rsquo;s mouth open and took the soaked fingers into her mouth. She lapped up her juices from his hand as the fingers in her ass began to scissor and stretch her out. She sucked onto them hard as she felt pleasure at the movement.</p><p>&ldquo;You have two fingers in your ass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;re ready for my cock?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she hissed.</p><p>Severus guided his cock into her pussy first, allowing her to enjoy the feeling of fullness for a moment. He pressed his fingers down and felt his cock through the wall. He just wanted to shag her brains out already.</p><p>He removed himself from her body, leaving her aching and fetched a bottle of lubricant from under the sink. As wet as she was, he knew it wasn&rsquo;t enough to suffice a proper shag. Thoroughly, he lubed his cock and then her asshole before pressing the tip at the entrance.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go slow,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She nodded and her head turned around to look at him. He gave her a reassuring smile before pushing the tip in slightly. Her eyes closed in bliss and her head turned to face the wall once more.</p><p>Lyra could feel her asshole stretching to accommodate Severus&rsquo; thick member. The sensation was unusual, it didn&rsquo;t feel painful or sensitive, she just felt as though she was being filled. Her ass was swallowing him so quickly and willingly that soon enough he was buried to the hilt.</p><p>Severus groaned as the tight hole swallowed him whole. The amount of friction was maddening, he wanted to move in and out quickly so he could come but he resisted. Instead, he allowed her to accommodate his size and felt her slowly relax under him.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep going, alright love?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She nodded and with that he pulled out slowly before thrusting back in. He was wrong about the friction being maddening, it was the slow pace that was driving him more insane. It didn&rsquo;t help that she clenched a bit when he entered.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you still ok?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she mumbled, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just strange.&rdquo;</p><p>She looked back at him and he had sucked his lips. He nodded at her and continued the tortuous pace. Eventually, her eyes fell shut and moans escaped her. He took it as an indicator to speed up so he did.</p><p>Slowly, he built his pace until it became a regular rhythm. Once he reached it he knew he wasn&rsquo;t going to last. He had dragged out his orgasm for so long that when it finally hit him the relief was overwhelming. His pelvis jolted forward has he came into her.</p><p>With a pop he slid out and the two rushed into the shower to clean things up.</p><p>~</p><p>It was an odd feeling to be returning to the place she had resigned from only a few months earlier, particularly with her ex-Professor in tow. They had woken up rather early that day, managing to convince Professor Sprout to allow them to drain her Venomous Tentacula of all its venom. Once they had finished at the Greenhouses the two walked past the anti-apparition boundary and apparated to the reception area of St. Mungo&rsquo;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.</p><p>The Welcome Witch&rsquo;s eyebrow raised at the sight of the pair. &ldquo;Trainee Lestrange,&rdquo; the witch addressed her, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thompson needed some help with the Psyrot cure,&rdquo; Lyra replied earning a glare from the blonde. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just be heading to the second floor with Severus.&rdquo;</p><p>The wizard followed her as she tugged at his bicep, pulling him towards a set of double doors and down a corridor which lead to a set of rickety old stairs. The portraits all seemed to know her and she acted chipper on their ascent as they asked her how she was fairing. They stepped onto the landing of the second floor and Lyra pushed open the set of double doors which had a sign reading MAGICAL BUGS AND DISEASES.</p><p>The ward was completely full. It was obvious that they had magically extended the boundaries of the walls to accomodate more people. Most of the people in the beds were sleeping, no doubt under the effects of Sleeping Draught due to their affliction of Psyrot. Lyra made her way through with a sense of determination towards a group of young wizards in their signature lime-green robes.</p><p>&ldquo;Lyra Lestrange,&rdquo; a young, brown-haired wizard addressed her. &ldquo;Pleasure to see you.&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded and repeated the formalities back to the wizard. &ldquo;Pleasure to see you, Thompson.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Professor Snape,&rdquo; the wizard&rsquo;s arm stretched outwards, knocking Lyra aside in the process, &nbsp;offering his hand to Severus. His eyes didn&rsquo;t even move to acknowledge the gesture, he noticed Lyra grit her teeth at the man and decided that pleasantries weren&rsquo;t needed.</p><p>He recognised the boy from his years in his class, Jack Thompson. An arrogant Gryffindor that somehow managed to do well in Potions despite blowing up his cauldron in his third year. Severus&rsquo; face remained sour before looking down at the wizard&rsquo;s hand and back up at him. The look was enough to get Jack to retract his hand and nod.</p><p>Jack turned to Lyra, &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s this cure you&rsquo;ve thought up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Venomous Tentacula venom,&rdquo; she said, pulling an already diluted sample out of her pocket.</p><p>Jack rolled his eyes, &ldquo;We want them to live and not be in more discomfort.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra gave a very deep and dramatic sigh, &ldquo;Look let&rsquo;s just see if it&rsquo;ll work.&rdquo;</p><p>Jack gestured towards a patient who was very much conscious, looking terrified at the suggestion. Lyra walked towards the frightened man and squatted in front of him, holding his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to die from this, you&rsquo;ll feel a slight burning sensation and possibly a headache but that should pass. Do you consent to this experiment?&rdquo;</p><p>The man nodded and Lyra stood up, gesturing for Severus to approach. She passed the vial to him and extracted her wand. Tapping the side of his head, non-verbally she cast &lsquo;Viscera ostende&rsquo; twice to reveal the man&rsquo;s brain. The sight shocked her, his brain was completely covered in worms, eating through the layers of his brain. She was surprised that the man was still upright.</p><p>With a nod to Severus, he heated the contents of the vial with his wand and held it in front of his face. &ldquo;Inhale deeply,&rdquo; she instructed.</p><p>The patient followed her directions and his head recoiled. Severus stared at the man&rsquo;s face as tears began to spill from his eyes in reaction to the burning sensation that would be travelling up through his nose. Lyra watched his brain intently for a reaction.</p><p>Her eyes lit up.</p><p>After a few minutes the worms began to just dissolve in reaction to poison that was now in his bloodstream. Lyra wanted to jump up and down in excitement, to scream and throw herself into the arms of the man that she loved but she restrained herself. Instead she just looked up at him and smiled.</p><p>Her former colleagues were watching too, astounded at the effectiveness of the poison. They were quickly put to work in treating the patients, Severus instructing them on how to heat the vial to an evaporative temperature and Lyra watching on for any ill side effects. Severus went around, assisting the staff in administration but his bedside manner couldn&rsquo;t compare to that of Lyra&rsquo;s. He watched her in her element, taking care of those in need and he felt his heart grow fonder. Her kind words and gestures made his thoughts wander to what she would be like as a mother. She would be such a wonderful parent but he felt that smile fade as he thought that he would be an inadequate one.</p><p>Hours passed of the healing team administering Lyra&rsquo;s treatment for Psyrot. There were no ill side effects that had been observed and Lyra prayed that it would remain that way. She didn&rsquo;t need to be known as the witch who had killed off ill witches and wizards.</p><p>As the day drew to a close,the team of healers began to disperse, leaving Jack with Severus and Lyra whilst the others went to have dinner. The three of them were interrupted by a gang of journalists, bursting through the door. Somehow, word had gotten out that they had discovered the cure and The Daily Prophet wanted to get the exclusive.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; a young blonde woman with perfect curls framing her face had approached the healers, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve discovered the cure for Psyrot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, we have,&rdquo; Jack said confidently.</p><p>He peaked the interest of the journalist who extended a hand to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rita Skeeter, I would love to have exclusive publishing rights to your discovery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; the wizard replied, allowing Rita to whisk him away and sit him down.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and watched the wizard, curious as to what he was going to say. Her eyes glanced up at Severus who noticed her inquisitive look and both of their eyes watched the man as he was interviewed.</p><p>&ldquo;So, what lead to this breakthrough?&rdquo; Rita asked.</p><p>&ldquo;I, um,&rdquo; he began to stumble through his words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been interested in discovering the cure since it first showed. I read a lot of books and stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>Rita nodded, jotting everything down on a roll of parchment. &ldquo;And what is the cure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tentacula Venom,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She looked impressed, &ldquo;How did you manage that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you inhale it,&rdquo; Jack said.</p><p>&ldquo;Still plagiarising other people&rsquo;s work, I see,&rdquo; Severus commented, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame you&rsquo;ve always been such an awful liar.&rdquo;</p><p>Rita looked disgusted at Severus, &ldquo;So you did it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Lyra said.</p><p>Rita&rsquo;s eyes widened, &ldquo;A witch discovered the cure to Psyrot?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Magic isn&rsquo;t just for wizards,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course not, dear,&rdquo; the journalist gestured towards the seat next to her. &ldquo;Come tell me how you discovered it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would much rather have a reputable journalist cover my story,&rdquo; Lyra replied, her eyes rolled. &ldquo;Tell The Prophet to send someone better next time.&rdquo;</p><p>Rita huffed out of the room, her gaggle of colleagues following behind her. Severus felt a smirk creep across his lips in pride of what his - what was Lyra to him? His girlfriend? His lover? The pride faded as he stumbled across those words, unsure of the title the girl had in his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you do that?&rdquo; Jack asked, confronting the Potions Master.</p><p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Lyra snorted.</p><p>&ldquo;You ruined everything,&rdquo; Jack said, &ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve been-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I ruined everything?&rdquo; Lyra cut him off, &ldquo;Jack, you&rsquo;re nothing. You are completely incapable of independent thought and you&rsquo;re not going to take credit for my work this time. You can fuck right off.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra turned around and left, Severus following closely behind. She ran down the stairs and transfigured her clothes as she went, keen to leave St. Mungo&rsquo;s behind. The two stumbled onto the streets of London and one of Lyra&rsquo;s hands found its way into Severus&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you wanna go?&rdquo; she asked him, turning around her eyes darted over the muggle look Severus had donned. She had never seen him in anything other than his usual midnight blue button up robes. He had a white dress shirt on, hidden under a dark blue pullover jumper and black trench coat. She felt her lower lip be sucked in as she took in his look.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lovely Italian restaurant near here,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she replied, allowing him to pull her towards their destination.</p><p>They arrived to a busy but quaint little eatery in which they had to wait for a table briefly before sitting together in a little private booth.</p><p>&ldquo;So is this what you had in mind for our first date?&rdquo; she asked with a playful tone.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that your way to trick me into paying for you?&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not used to eating with muggles,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;I am actually,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I actually used to come here all the time with some of the other trainees.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jack?&rdquo;</p><p>She laughed, &ldquo;He was way above that. He wouldn&rsquo;t get caught in anything less than magical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the nature of the relationship between you too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a positive one,&rdquo; she said before pausing for a moment. Her lips pursed before continuing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d take credit for my work and it&rsquo;s rather sexist at the hospital. They wouldn&rsquo;t believe that I did anything so they&rsquo;d put me on paperwork whilst he climbed to the top.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it really that bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean, yeah there are a few female Healers but they&rsquo;re in rather soft positions,&rdquo; she said, beginning to play with the rim of her water glass. &ldquo;Nothing too high up unless it&rsquo;s more caring based positions, like my old boss was Miriam Strout who worked in permanent spell damage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Longbottoms,&rdquo; he replied with a grim face.</p><p>Lyra&rsquo;s jaw clenched and nodded. Conveniently at that point in time they were interrupted by the waitress. They ordered their meals and a bottle of wine before relaxing back into conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;That reporter was a real piece of work,&rdquo; Lura commented, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read her articles and books. Complete drivel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about your plan for world domination?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already got that all worked out,&rdquo; she said smugly. &ldquo;My friend, Gustav writes for The Wizarding Post . He&rsquo;s keen for the exclusive, plus the reach of The Post is much larger than The Prophet so it all works out for me.&rdquo;</p><p>The waitress arrived with a bottle of red and as soon as it started flowing the conversation followed suit. Genuine smiles were seen on the faces of both parties, lighting up Severus&rsquo; usual dark demeanour. Any onlooker would&rsquo;ve seen the couple and guessed that the two had been together for years, there was just an air of familiarity and comfort that hung around them.</p><p>When their food arrived and they were into their meal, Lyra noticed him eyeing her meal and extended a forkful if pasta to him. He followed the same gesture with his meal, Lyra looking deep into his eyes as she took the pasta into her mouth in an attempt to be seductive but she just ended up laughing, not taking herself too seriously.</p><p>The table was cleared and the waitress arrived with the bill. Lyra reached into her pocket to pull out her purse.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; the wizard asked eyeing her carefully as he too was reaching for his wallet.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying, Sev,&rdquo; she said as she flicked open the slender pouch and pulled out some muggle money.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to,&rdquo; he said, pulling out his wad of cash.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go halves?&rdquo;</p><p>His eyes narrowed at the suggestion but he relented, allowing the witch to pay for her half of the meal. As they left, Lyra&rsquo;s hand found its way into Severus&rsquo; once more. Silently, they wandered the streets and took in the sights. The falling snow and people walking around. It was nice to just be able to walk around and hold the hands of the one you loved without fear of judgement or being found out.</p><p>Lyra glanced over to her partner and caught his eyes. He had been absentmindedly staring at the girl, allowing her to guide him around. She smiled at him before asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo;</p><p>Severus stopped in his tracks and his hand released the witch&rsquo;s. He tucked it away into his transfigured coat. With a small sigh he exhaled, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re probably due to go back to Hogwarts.&rdquo;</p><p>Lyra screwed up her nose, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to be back until tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes lit up at the possibilities that unfurled in her mind. &ldquo;Anywhere as long as it&rsquo;s with you,&rdquo; she grinned. &ldquo;I know a nice hotel,&rdquo; she winked before her face fell, &ldquo;But I think Lucius knows I have a tendency to go there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We could go back to mine,&rdquo; he offered.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was my parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to go,&rdquo; she said, afraid she had touched a nerve. &ldquo;We can just head back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said, extending a hand out to her. With no hesitation Lyra took his hand.</p>",

When Lyra Lestrange&rsquo;s old headmaster offers her a position as Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher she finds herself thrown into an adventure involving a secret affair with a colleague, discovering the cure for a disease and dealing with students cursing themselves. Who knew that being a Hogwarts Professor was such a rollercoaster?</i></p>\n<p><i>Set in the school year of 1990-1991 with the prospect of a sequel, or two, on the horizon.</i></p>\n<p><i><b>Word Count: </b>4858</i></p>\n<p><i>Multichapter Fic (Expected to be around 30-35 chapters with a planned sequel which will take place during the Harry Potter Books)</i></p>\n<p><b>Chapter Eighteen - Administration</b></p>\n<p>Somehow, Severus managed to keep himself up through the night to ensure that Lyra survived the dose of venomous tentacula juice. From his extensive knowledge of potions and poisons he suspected that the witch would be fine but one hand remained firmly in his pocket clutching a bezoar on the slim chance that he was wrong. Every so often his eyes would glance downwards to check that she was still breathing, usually drawn by her stirring in her sleep.</p>\n<p>Severus&rsquo; eyes grew heavy as the night passed. The steadiness of Lyra&rsquo;s breath tempted him to sleep but he found himself on his feet pacing, keeping his blood circulating to keep himself awake. Eventually he gave in to the use of Wideye Potion and took up Lyra&rsquo;s offer of reading materials, sneaking into her office to browse. There he found her draft report along with the copious amounts of notes she had made over the weeks she had been working on the solution.</p>\n</p>",
