And that life is gonna end at sunrise, when she will finally let herself burn. But then a stranger shows up at the beach and changes everything.</small></p><p><small><i>Vampire AU, Modern AU, A few mentions of Ramsay, suicide attempt (sorta?), soulmates (sorta?), instant love</i></small></p></blockquote><p>There was something magical about sunrises. Maybe it was because not that many people would ever witness one. Maybe it was because they were the promise of a new beginning, of a new day filled with new chances and possibilities. Maybe it was the fact that for almost a thousand years Sansa had never seen one.</p><p>But today she would. She would stay here on the beach to watch the sun climb higher and higher. She would watch the bright colours taking over the night sky. She would wait for the burning fire to consume her and to end the way too long and way too miserable life she had known.</p><p>And this time she would not crawl back at the last possible minute, like she had done so many times before, hoping against better judgement that maybe there was still something worth living for after what Ramsay Bolton had done to her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t made for this life. She wasn\u2019t made to live in darkness and to shy away from the light. She wasn\u2019t made to lure innocent humans into her trap so she could fill her unending appetite for blood. </p><p>She was s summer child. She loved playing in the sun with her siblings. She loved creating flower crowns. She loved swimming in the cold lake near their house.</p><p>And even though it was almost a thousand years ago since she had seen the sun and her siblings she still missed them every day.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d </p><p>Sansa looked up when someone appeared next to her. </p><!-- more --><p>The boy was out of breath and his skin covered in sweat and the black curls glued to his forehead showed that he was probably running for quite some time already. \u201cUsually I have the beach for myself at this time of the day.\u201d He smiled however and he took a few deep breaths while he followed her glance to the horizon in the far distance. \u201cAre you here to see the sun rise?\u201d Without an invitation he sat down next to her. </p><p>Sansa saw the vein in his neck beating and the smell of his blood made her throat dry.</p><p>She had tried everything she could to prevent herself from harming anyone. She had stolen bags from the blood bank, even though she knew there were patients who needed the blood a lot more than her. And before that she had tried to live on animal blood, but she had hardly been able to keep it down.</p><p>So eventually she had always lost control and had killed more people that she could bear.</p><p>It was only because of her own cowardice that she had allowed herself to live this long.</p><p>\u201cMostly I\u2019m the quiet one.\u201d The boy leaned back on his elbows. He didn\u2019t seem to care about the sand and his sweat mingling. \u201cBut I get it, sometimes we just don\u2019t wanna talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m a monster.\u201d Sansa blurted the words out. She didn\u2019t really know why. Maybe it was her version of a confession on a death bed. Not that she had the illusion she would be welcomed in Heaven, if it even existed. \u201cI&rsquo;ve lived almost a thousand years and killed more people than I can count.\u201d At least someone would know she had eventually done the right thing. Although she doubted if he would believe her. \u201cI came here to burn in the sun. I came here to die.\u201d</p><p>The boy kept silent. He pulled his knees up and pressed them to his chest. A visible shiver went through him when he wrapped his arms around his legs.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m just making something up. You think I\u2019m crazy and belong in an asylum. But it\u2019s true.\u201d Sansa felt tears stinging in her eyes, but fought them. She was not gonna die crying. She was gonna die with her back straight and her chin up. \u201cI should have done it right away when I discovered what I became, what Ramsay made me.\u201d She shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve lived for so much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been lonely.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice trembled. </p><p>\u201cPeople like me don\u2019t have friends.\u201d Sansa let out a deep sigh. \u201cYou can\u2019t be friends with people when you can never tell them who you are.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cAnd as soon as you tell them the truth they run away screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d The stranger turned his head towards her. His eyes were beautiful, but it was the deep frown on his forehead that caught her attention.</p><p>A smile spread across Sansa\u2019s face. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cBut you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna kill me?\u201d The boy kept his glance locked with hers. \u201cWill I be your very last victim?\u201d</p><p>Sansa thought about that question for a moment. \u201cI think I can control myself until I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one would miss me if you would.\u201d His voice was nothing but a weak whisper and Sansa furrowed her eyebrows and cocked her head.</p><p>\u201cNo one? You don\u2019t have a nice and pretty girl waiting for you in your bed? Or a father and mother worried about your early morning runs?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy mother died when giving birth to me. My father sent me away to boarding school because I looked too much like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the pretty girl?\u201d </p><p>The boy shrugged. \u201cLike I said. I\u2019m not really a talker.

She had stolen bags from the blood bank, even though she knew there were patients who needed the blood a lot more than her. And before that she had tried to live on animal blood, but she had hardly been able to keep it down.</p><p>So eventually she had always lost control and had killed more people that she could bear.</p><p>It was only because of her own cowardice that she had allowed herself to live this long.</p><p>&ldquo;Mostly I&rsquo;m the quiet one.&rdquo; The boy leaned back on his elbows. He didn&rsquo;t seem to care about the sand and his sweat mingling. &ldquo;But I get it, sometimes we just don&rsquo;t wanna talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a monster.&rdquo; Sansa blurted the words out. She didn&rsquo;t really know why. Maybe it was her version of a confession on a death bed. Not that she had the illusion she would be welcomed in Heaven, if it even existed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived almost a thousand years and killed more people than I can count.&rdquo; At least someone would know she had eventually done the right thing. Although she doubted if he would believe her. &ldquo;I came here to burn in the sun. I came here to die.&rdquo;</p><p>The boy kept silent. He pulled his knees up and pressed them to his chest. A visible shiver went through him when he wrapped his arms around his legs.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m just making something up. You think I&rsquo;m crazy and belong in an asylum. But it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Sansa felt tears stinging in her eyes, but fought them. She was not gonna die crying. She was gonna die with her back straight and her chin up. &ldquo;I should have done it right away when I discovered what I became, what Ramsay made me.&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;ve lived for so much longer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must&rsquo;ve been lonely.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s voice trembled. </p><p>&ldquo;People like me don&rsquo;t have friends.&rdquo; Sansa let out a deep sigh. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be friends with people when you can never tell them who you are.&rdquo; She paused for a moment. &ldquo;And as soon as you tell them the truth they run away screaming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The stranger turned his head towards her. His eyes were beautiful, but it was the deep frown on his forehead that caught her attention.</p><p>A smile spread across Sansa&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She swallowed. &ldquo;But you should.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you gonna kill me?&rdquo; The boy kept his glance locked with hers. &ldquo;Will I be your very last victim?&rdquo;</p><p>Sansa thought about that question for a moment. &ldquo;I think I can control myself until I&rsquo;ll die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one would miss me if you would.&rdquo; His voice was nothing but a weak whisper and Sansa furrowed her eyebrows and cocked her head.</p><p>&ldquo;No one?
