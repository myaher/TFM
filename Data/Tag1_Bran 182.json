The show introduces the novel concept\nthat the Three-Eyed Raven is both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE6qT8OckB0\">Brynden Rivers</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kliN5IyD0wI&amp;t=1m11s\">Bran Stark</a>\n(chalking up any ???? as \u201c<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek_BcOj_Tgg\">difficult to explain</a></i>\u201d\nalso known as, this is never getting explained in the show, forget about it).\nObviously, neither of them is a raven with three eyes, but that\u2019s their\nsymbolic figure which everyone associates with these two characters anyway\n(#A).</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6a9925aa012187982dc7a969743cfee8/tumblr_inline_pke1iezVAe1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The fourth clip show what Bran will learn\nat the cave, to look into the past. There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"/></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit).

It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>\u2019,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would\u2019ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br/></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran&rsquo;s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There\u2019s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned\u2019s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon\u2019s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn\u2019t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the \u201ctime machine\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctravelling\u201d on).

The first clip is a weirwood Heart Tree over a cave\nentrance, which is how the place proper is depicted, and the second clip is a\nmyriad of roots crisscrossing, typical of the inside layout of said cave. These\ntwo are very upfront, the real deal looks exactly like that after all.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2dc03e6f23ac3240c4a2d0ed121b0ada/tumblr_inline_pke1hb5jaz1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The third clip shows who Bran will meet and\nwho he will become, the Three-Eyed Raven.

There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit).

It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>\u2019,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would\u2019ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran\u2019s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There\u2019s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned\u2019s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon\u2019s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn\u2019t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the \u201ctime machine\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctravelling\u201d on).

There\u2019s a close-up to the raven\u2019s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying \u201c<i>you\u2019ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>\u201d).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that\u2019s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he\u2019s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won\u2019t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran\u2019s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he\u2019s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it \u00a0suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since \u201ccrows\u201d (Brothers of the Night\u2019s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn\u2019t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They\u2019re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that\u2019s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran\u2019s three flashbacks about his\nfather\u2019s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned\u2019s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn\u2019t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn\u2019t fit). It corresponds to Bran\u2019s Winterfell flasback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBz54ql-u0\">Home</a></i>\u2019, where Ned is\nsparring with Benjen (training for battle) and Lyanna shows up to hang out for\na bit (highlighting the bond between the siblings), as well as Bran\u2019s first Tower\nof Joy flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aO_CsqfBAo\">Oathbreaker</a></i>\u2019, where Ned\nfights against the Kingsguard with the objective of rescuing Lyanna \n(B1)\n\n.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/37fad0d846ad719ca5d16e05fb0eb8df/tumblr_inline_pke1n8jp9t1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"288\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb32f1ab4fcb43f3b6933651b9dd790/tumblr_inline_pke1r1vTjr1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"288\"></figure><p>The sixth clip feature Ned while he\u2019s\nimprisoned at the Black Cells in King\u2019s Landing, the fire bursting to life in\nthe background and reflected in his eyes (#B2); an allegory of Ned witnessing\nJon\u2019s birth (he is half a fire child after all, I know, urgh, poor boy) and\nhis promise to Lyanna which has held him \u201ccaptive\u201d for half of his life (this\nbinding motif is more obvious in the books, as Ned thinks about Lyanna and this\npromise frequently). It corresponds to Bran\u2019s flashback in \u2018<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>\u2019,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would\u2019ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran\u2019s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There\u2019s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned\u2019s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon\u2019s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It\u2019s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon\u2019s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned\u2019s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran\u2019s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn\u2019t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the \u201ctime machine\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctravelling\u201d on). This tree motif is\nrepeated in subsequent visions for the same reasons.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c78c38a6d2d07fe4d13f53c261d7820c/tumblr_inline_pke1syLqzI1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa63e0657bee4dde3b76225a2ceeaa18/tumblr_inline_pke1z1uhEc1rrj926_1280.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2560\" data-orig-height=\"720\"></figure><p>The seventh clip is a frozen wasteland, with\nreally busy clouds in the sky and the sunrise with the sun hanging really low while it goes from\n\u201cright to left\u201d, which is an allegory for time going back in the \u201ctrue north\u201d\nduring winter (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxRcXHI_tI\">a very <i>good</i> one</a>).

It\nalso suggests that while all visions are being accessed through the Weirwood\nNetwork, the ones for the Night King\u2019s visions were accessible because they are\n\u201crecorded\u201d within the network (the raven touches the tree), Ned\u2019s visions were accessible\ndue to being buried in the Winterfell Crypts which the Winterfell\u2019s weirwood Heart\nTree most likely is connected to (the raven goes through the Winterfell Crypts).</p><p><b>#B3:</b> Bran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ&amp;t=3m\">returns\nhere</a> shortly after and there is <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvqFXOB.jpg\">this</a>\ngesture, which may either be a signal that the pact was broken by men and / or\nthat the Night King seeks the pact once again.</p><h2>\n\nTHIRD VISION : present\n\n</h2><p>The third vision is composed of three clips,\nthe first sets timing which is the present and the other two set the focus subjects,\nwhich also detail how Bran uses his powers in season 7.

There&rsquo;s a close-up to the raven&rsquo;s claw taking\nimpulse and taking off, a reference to the jumping and flying motif that Bran\nhas (more apparent in the books, but the show kept Brynden saying &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>&rdquo;).\nThen, the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, metaphorical travelling through\ntime as that&rsquo;s a funerary crypt, representative of the past. As a side-note, the\nfact that these are the Winterfell Crypts, where all Starks are buried, is\nsuggestive that the past that he&rsquo;s going to be looking into is tied to House Stark.</p><p><b>#A:</b> Rivers is identified as the Three-Eyed <i>Crow</i>, though he has raven messengers instead. Unless this is a case\nof the show changing book concepts because the dumb general audience might get\nconfused (Asha being renamed Yara, so she won&rsquo;t be confounded with Osha), then\nthis suggests that a mashup streamlining took place somewhere.</p><p>In the books, this suggests that Bran&rsquo;s\nfinal form is the Three-Eyed <i>Raven</i>,\nbecause he&rsquo;s the important character in the narrative, as well as Bran surpassing\nRivers as a greenseer, since ravens are portrayed as superior to crows. Furthermore, it &nbsp;suggests that Rivers will die in the cave\nwhile Bran will go back to Winterfell, since &ldquo;crows&rdquo; (Brothers of the Night&rsquo;s\nWatch) are bound to the Wall for life (the roots of the Three-Eyed Cave are\nshackles for Rivers as well) while ravens (messenger ravens) are taken to other\nplaces inside cages (Bran too is bound as a cripple and has to be taken\nsomewhere by others) but will fly home when released. Moreover, it suggests that the abnormal\ntalking raven at the Wall has something to do with this streamlining, since he\nhas been linked to Rivers before (at least once, in <i>Jon I ~ ADWD</i>), yet he was cut entirely from the show (and only an\nidiot wouldn&rsquo;t add a talking bird, <a href=\"https://ohmy.disney.com/quiz/2015/06/28/quiz-which-disney-animal-sidekick-are-you/\">which\nhas huge potential in turning into a mascot and sell ridiculous amounts of\nmerchandise</a>, unless the gains were bigger than the losses)</p><h2>\n\nSECOND VISION : past\n\n</h2><p>The second vision is composed of nine clips,\ndetailing what Bran is going to be looking at in season 6. This one can be\ndivided into two major groups, one centred in Ned and one centred in the White\nWalkers, for the sake of simplification that is what I did. They&rsquo;re actually\npretty extra and pretty stupid if taken at first value (and this episode was\nwritten by GRRM, so that&rsquo;s unlikely), so they beg the viewer to put their\ntinfoil hat on and analyse the epileptic trees, so I did.</p><p>\n\n<b>EDDARD STARK\n\n</b></p><p>The first two clips show Eddard Stark and\nhis role in R+L=J, roughly corresponding to Bran&rsquo;s three flashbacks about his\nfather&rsquo;s past which all feature Lyanna. Though separated by the audio-visual\ncue, these clips follow the raven flying down the Winterfell Crypts, which highly\nsuggested that the visions that would follow would be about House Stark,\nspecifically of people that were buried there. Accordingly, these two clips are\nabout Ned as well as Lyanna, which are both Starks buried at the Winterfell\nCrypts.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d96eda3c1733179e699bbc2bd894a963/tumblr_inline_pke1ktATtA1rrj926_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The fifth clip is Ned sharpening Ice, an\nallegory for Ned&rsquo;s going to war for the sake of his sister. To sharpen a sword\nis to prepare it for battle and adding this scene specifically is especially glaring\nbecause Ice is a Valyrian steel sword which doesn&rsquo;t need to be sharpened in the\nfirst place (they also bothered to film a new scene instead of repurposing the\nclip where Ned cleans Ice with an oilcloth from the very first episode - <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TpwBWyZ.png\">even their hands are switched</a> - because\nthat thematic wouldn&rsquo;t fit). It corresponds to Bran&rsquo;s Winterfell flasback in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yBz54ql-u0\">Home</a></i>&rsquo;, where Ned is\nsparring with Benjen (training for battle) and Lyanna shows up to hang out for\na bit (highlighting the bond between the siblings), as well as Bran&rsquo;s first Tower\nof Joy flashback in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aO_CsqfBAo\">Oathbreaker</a></i>&rsquo;, where Ned\nfights against the Kingsguard with the objective of rescuing Lyanna \n(B1)\n\n.<br /></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/37fad0d846ad719ca5d16e05fb0eb8df/tumblr_inline_pke1n8jp9t1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cdb32f1ab4fcb43f3b6933651b9dd790/tumblr_inline_pke1r1vTjr1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The sixth clip feature Ned while he&rsquo;s\nimprisoned at the Black Cells in King&rsquo;s Landing, the fire bursting to life in\nthe background and reflected in his eyes (#B2); an allegory of Ned witnessing\nJon&rsquo;s birth (he is half a fire child after all, I know, urgh, poor boy) and\nhis promise to Lyanna which has held him &ldquo;captive&rdquo; for half of his life (this\nbinding motif is more obvious in the books, as Ned thinks about Lyanna and this\npromise frequently). It corresponds to Bran&rsquo;s flashback in &lsquo;<i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiiP9JX1wHw\">The Winds of Winter</a></i>&rsquo;,\nwhere Ned goes up the staircase as Lyanna is screaming from giving birth (her\ndress is also bloody, which means she just did it, otherwise she would&rsquo;ve been\ncleaned by whatever attendant there) as well as Lyanna asking Ned to protect the\nnew-born Jon.<br /></p><p><b>#B1:</b> I was told that the original script for this would be more extensive, including \na scene with<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_and_the_Rose#cite_note-Vanity_Fair_article-6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bran&rsquo;s\nuncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children, so one more notch on the bedpost</a>.<b><br /></b></p><p><b>#B2:</b> There&rsquo;s some eye thing going here. The fire is reflected in Ned&rsquo;s\neyes, the correspondent scene has a focus on Jon&rsquo;s eyes both as a baby and as an\nadult (even in the scripts). It&rsquo;s worth noting that in the show, they changed Jon&rsquo;s\neye-colour from grey (like Ned&rsquo;s) to brown (and cast Lyanna with brown eyes).\nThere might be something dumb about eye-colour in season 8.</p><p>\n\n<b>WHITE WALKERS\n\n</b></p><p>The following four clips show stuff from\nBeyond the Wall, corresponding to Bran&rsquo;s flashbacks about the Night King / White\nWalkers / Wights. These are presented differently from the ones with Ned,\nbecause they need to establish a time context which wasn&rsquo;t needed with him (we\nknew when he lived). They do so through the visual cue of the sun travelling\nthrough the sky in the background of the weirwood Heart Three over the Three-Eyed\nCave (like the &ldquo;time machine&rdquo; that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;travelling&rdquo; on). This tree motif is\nrepeated in subsequent visions for the same reasons.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c78c38a6d2d07fe4d13f53c261d7820c/tumblr_inline_pke1syLqzI1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa63e0657bee4dde3b76225a2ceeaa18/tumblr_inline_pke1z1uhEc1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>The seventh clip is a frozen wasteland, with\nreally busy clouds in the sky and the sunrise with the sun hanging really low while it goes from\n&ldquo;right to left&rdquo;, which is an allegory for time going back in the &ldquo;true north&rdquo;\nduring winter (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXxRcXHI_tI\">a very <i>good</i> one</a>).

At the time those visions were shown, the audience &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t know&rdquo; how\nthese visions are being accessed (yes, Bran touched the tree, but nothing else&hellip;\nand the show audience should be &ldquo;flying blind&rdquo; without the book information). It\nalso suggests that while all visions are being accessed through the Weirwood\nNetwork, the ones for the Night King&rsquo;s visions were accessible because they are\n&ldquo;recorded&rdquo; within the network (the raven touches the tree), Ned&rsquo;s visions were accessible\ndue to being buried in the Winterfell Crypts which the Winterfell&rsquo;s weirwood Heart\nTree most likely is connected to (the raven goes through the Winterfell Crypts).</p><p><b>#B3:</b> Bran <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtS9PPMK_WQ&amp;t=3m\">returns\nhere</a> shortly after and there is <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/mvqFXOB.jpg\">this</a>\ngesture, which may either be a signal that the pact was broken by men and / or\nthat the Night King seeks the pact once again.</p><h2>\n\nTHIRD VISION : present\n\n</h2><p>The third vision is composed of three clips,\nthe first sets timing which is the present and the other two set the focus subjects,\nwhich also detail how Bran uses his powers in season 7.

The first suggests that Bran &lsquo;<i>seeing</i>&rsquo; will resolve the conflict with the\nNight King / White Walkers / Wights and we know that in his case, &lsquo;<i>seeing</i>&rsquo; also means looking into the past\nand learning things that resolve the present. The second suggests that Bran &lsquo;<i>screaming</i>&rsquo; will resolve the conflict\nwith Danielle / dragons, which sounds dumb until you realise the sound of Bran &lsquo;<i>screaming</i>&rsquo; leaks into the sound of dragon&rsquo;s\n&lsquo;<i>screeching</i>&rsquo; and we know that in his\ncase, a human-animal transition also means skinchanging (and &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;ll never walk again, but you will fly</i>&rdquo;\nas well as Bran&rsquo;s wish to be a knight and he can be a <i>dragonknight</i> &#10024;).</p><p><b>D2:</b> This shtick of the sun travelling from &ldquo;left to right&rdquo; is the\nequivalent of a day, with the sunrise at the left and the sunset at the right.\nIn this vision cluster, the sunrise was used to lynchpin the origins of Night\nKing / White Walkers / Wights and which is also known as <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Long_Night#The_War_for_the_Dawn\">The\nWar for the Dawn</a>, while the sunset comes after <i>everything</i>, The &ldquo;day&rdquo; started after a Long Night and as such, this suggests\nthat another Long Night is coming again at the end of Game of Thrones.</p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>In &lsquo;<i>The\nLion and the Rose</i>&rsquo;, Bran stops at a weirwood Heart Tree beyond the Wall and\nhe has his first vision cluster (the video for the whole thing can be watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gh0-4hOzyw\">here</a>). While this vision\ncluster should be seen as a whole, as it actually metaphorically shows the same\nthing as the other prophetic vision Bran has later. The first two major subsets\nare the most developed, with the other two major subsets just a hint for what&rsquo;s\nto come, as those will be expanded through other visions Bran will have.</p>\n<p>This cluster vision is a set of eighteen distinct\nvideo clips, with about half of them being repurposed from past scenes (though\nthere are a few new ones). This can be divided into four mutually exclusive\nsubsets, as they are punctuated by an audio-visual cue: a black fade-out and a\nwhite flash-in, followed by a drum-like sound effect (this audio-visual cue is\nused recurrently from that point forward when Bran trips out). These divisions\nactually neatly list what things Bran is going to be looking at each season from\nthis point forth.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> I attach a few observations with # before them at the end of each\nsection, these are just speculation based on things and not really part of this\nexercise.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31c113b590979cab013f6ed5ca69f667/tumblr_inline_pke2s2Pnvy1rrj926_1280.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <i>subtle</i><br /></p>\n</p>",

        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really see a chance of them &lsquo;winning&rsquo;. We might see that the existence of the WW is more complicated than meets the eye. Showwise they are an experiment of the CotF gone awry and this means they have to be stopped and probably will. </p><p>But as you I&rsquo;m not that invested in the defeat of the WW. I&rsquo;m curious as to <b>how</b> they will be defeated and what kind of sacrifice will be necessary, but I&rsquo;m quite sure that GRRM intended for the other side of fire to be problematic as well (eternal winter against eternal summer, both are no good news). Showwise I think they gave us a hint that the elimination of the Night King might solve the problem. To me it would make sense if they try to remove the dragonglass dagger from his heart and release him to death - which he might even want. I don&rsquo;t think killing him will be as easy as beheading him with a Valyrian sword. Valyrian swords can hurt WW but I doubt the same holds true for the NK. So, they will have to undo whatever it was the CotF did to the Night King. I really hope that Bran will get the most important role in that plot. He is the one with magical abilities. He should be the one to finish the NK. I suppose the weirwood or some other holy place might be important as well for this.</p><p>Bookwise I think balance has to be restored. Which might mean that all the magic of the CotF has to be destroyed and then also the magic from the fire side, because I picture it like some kind of scales : everytime the scales tip too far in one direction the other side grows stronger as well. There was a Long Night before and there was the fire and blood magic of the Valyrians. My hunch is (and I have talked about this with <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a>) that Bloodraven vanished beyond the wall on the search for immortality (because villains always want immortality) and began to orchestrate the revival of magic possibly by tricking the CotF about his real intentions. I strongly suspect that the tragedy of Summerhall where Aegon V died in the attempt to hatch dragons is somehow connected to Bloodraven. At that time the scales were not so far out of balance that dragons could be burn. We see the WW back and strong in the prologue of AGOT and the first episode. So, the scales have been triggered. At the end of the book - framing the events between ice and fire btw - the dragons are born. By then the scales are off.</p><p>So, my idea would be that they will have to eliminate all magic. So my idea is the following - and please note that this is just a hunch, based on my belief that ice and fire are both bad news and that one aspect of bittersweet will be that magic will be gone. In LotR the Elves know that the defeat of Sauron will mean that their magic will vanish as well, although it even is in essential good magic. I think it is a bit more complicated with ASOIAF : ice and fire magic are both bad, or rather very dangerous but it is possible to do good with them - like Jon&rsquo;s resurrection. </p><p>So, I think the solution might be to try to eliminate the magic of both sides simultaneously. For example : Use the dragons to destroy the weirwood as it is there that the magic of the CotF linger, undo the making of the NK to get rid of the wights and then kill the dragons - for example with weirwood arrows and spears collected before the destruction of course. </p><p>I only fear a bit for Jon in that case, because it is quite possible that the end of magic means his death. </p><p>Losing magic even though it has been depicted as dangerous time and again would be somewhat sad, as it is in LotR and might count as 'bittersweet&rsquo;.</p><p>I doubt we&rsquo;ll get an open end like a stalemate or  even the WW winning. What would be the point? GRRM does not write pointless nor is his apparent grit a sign of nihilism. It is all about choices, and the choice to destroy magic to save the world might come down to be very hard indeed.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",

So, they will have to undo whatever it was the CotF did to the Night King. I really hope that Bran will get the most important role in that plot. He is the one with magical abilities. He should be the one to finish the NK. I suppose the weirwood or some other holy place might be important as well for this.</p><p>Bookwise I think balance has to be restored. Which might mean that all the magic of the CotF has to be destroyed and then also the magic from the fire side, because I picture it like some kind of scales : everytime the scales tip too far in one direction the other side grows stronger as well. There was a Long Night before and there was the fire and blood magic of the Valyrians. My hunch is (and I have talked about this with <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mToi2Gb5I2BdvTUkmqqh-wg\">@lady-in-a-song</a>) that Bloodraven vanished beyond the wall on the search for immortality (because villains always want immortality) and began to orchestrate the revival of magic possibly by tricking the CotF about his real intentions. I strongly suspect that the tragedy of Summerhall where Aegon V died in the attempt to hatch dragons is somehow connected to Bloodraven. At that time the scales were not so far out of balance that dragons could be burn. We see the WW back and strong in the prologue of AGOT and the first episode. So, the scales have been triggered. At the end of the book - framing the events between ice and fire btw - the dragons are born. By then the scales are off.</p><p>So, my idea would be that they will have to eliminate all magic. So my idea is the following - and please note that this is just a hunch, based on my belief that ice and fire are both bad news and that one aspect of bittersweet will be that magic will be gone. In LotR the Elves know that the defeat of Sauron will mean that their magic will vanish as well, although it even is in essential good magic. I think it is a bit more complicated with ASOIAF : ice and fire magic are both bad, or rather very dangerous but it is possible to do good with them - like Jon\u2019s resurrection. </p><p>So, I think the solution might be to try to eliminate the magic of both sides simultaneously. For example : Use the dragons to destroy the weirwood as it is there that the magic of the CotF linger, undo the making of the NK to get rid of the wights and then kill the dragons - for example with weirwood arrows and spears collected before the destruction of course. </p><p>I only fear a bit for Jon in that case, because it is quite possible that the end of magic means his death. </p><p>Losing magic even though it has been depicted as dangerous time and again would be somewhat sad, as it is in LotR and might count as 'bittersweet\u2019.</p><p>I doubt we\u2019ll get an open end like a stalemate or  even the WW winning. What would be the point? GRRM does not write pointless nor is his apparent grit a sign of nihilism. It is all about choices, and the choice to destroy magic to save the world might come down to be very hard indeed.</p><p>Thanks for the ask!</p>",
