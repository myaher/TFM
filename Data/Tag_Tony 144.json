        "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d she stared at the man, utterly lost with what he began to say the moment things calmed down. She bet it had to do with both cultural differences and her lack of understanding what was \u2018In\u2019 with everyone else.</p><p>Since the end of the Shikon, which she and her friends had won the battle against Naraku, Kagome had returned home changed in more ways than she thought possible. Apparently, the prolonged exposure to Naraku\u2019s miasma had been lethal enough to alter her. Giving her abilities a more spider-like qualities.</p><p>Much to her disgust.</p><p>After everything, she went through and survived, she didn\u2019t take too kindly to learning via the powers that are, that she herself would be more spider-like.</p><p>So when she was returned home, and realized that there was no going back, it was then that some old friends approached her. And more or less turned her into a superhero. It made for keeping the more supernatural elements of Tokyo in line easier to understand for the public eye.</p><p>Only this time, she ended up in New York and crossing paths with the city\u2019s own heroes. Including another spider based hero.</p><p>Turning to said hero, just a tad taller than herself, she attempted to communicate with them silently. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was to get a definition of what the man was saying, or to get him to leave her alone.</p><p>The young man in question scratched at the back of his head, shrugging as he chuckled beneath his own mask. \u201cHaha-ah\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p><p>Turning to the armored man, she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cCan you repeat that please? This time use words I can understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse words\u2026 Are you serious?\u201d the suit landed with a heavy clunk, the face plate lifting and the entire helmet retracting to reveal the man beneath. \u201cYou\u2019re how old, and don\u2019t know what a meme is?\u201d</p><p>Brows furrowing, Kagome shook her head. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA meme.\u201d when his brows furrowed, lips screwing at her continued lack of response, he narrowed his eyes. \u201cA meme! An online movement that spreads like virus!\u201d</p><p>Blanching, Kagome leaned back. \u201cYou should see a doctor for that!\u201d</p><p>A few of the other heroes off to the side attempted to cover their amusement at her response. Snorting and coughing to outright hide their laughter, one whipping away when the man turned on them to level them with a glare. The others were far too interested in watching the proceedings.</p><p>\u201cNot an STD!\u201d the man all but exploded, cheeks uncharacteristically flushed in slight embarrassment. No thanks to a teenie bopper. \u201cAn online trend! Something that pretty much teens redo and remake to continue it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d she remembers Souta showing her some things he thought she might find funny on the internet. The ones where student were remaking a famous anime character\u2019s signature battle move amused her. Kam-mama-something or other. \u201cAnd what was the one you mentioned again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTide Pod Challenge!\u201d he ran an armored hand over his face, sighing at having to explain the joke to a teen of all people. It was no longer funny. And he wasn\u2019t enjoying how it was being turned against him.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of such a challenge.\u201d Kagome tapped at her chin, thankful that the mask she had been supplied with covered the upper half of her face and not her entire face. She wasn\u2019t sure how the other teen did it, breathing and speaking through the tight material. \u201cIs it anything like that ice bucket challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the other teen finally jumped in, arms waving about and drawing her attention. \u201cTide Pods are these little packets you put in a dishwasher, they contain soaps. Apparently some people thought their new design made them look\u2026 delicious? And then challenged themselves and others to eating one?\u201d</p><p>Kagome reeled back once more. \u201cWhat? Why?!\u201d she spun about to face the man again, lips dipped down in a frown as the mask did hinder the use of facial expressions. \u201cYou think I did something stupid and dangerous to get these\u2026 these\u2026 these spider abilities?!\u201d she waved her hands the teen next to her. \u201cThat he started something and I thought, \u2018why not, seems fun\u2019 and followed suit?!\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes blinked widely down at her, obviously not ready for the outburst. \u201cWell\u2026 you teens are crazy. I mean, her ran around in old sweaters and wrestling masks when he first started out. Like that hid his identity. Right, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Hey, hey, hey!\u201d the teen leaned in closer, raising a hand in an attempt to hinder her from hearing his words. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid, we already all know.\u201d the man gave the red and blue clad teen a pointed look. With a shake of his head, he turned to look at her again. \u201cLook, shouldn\u2019t you be all\u2026 magical girl with glittery powers and as far away from spider for a teen hero from Tokyo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagical girls are for entertainment in the form of manga or anime. Last I checked this is real life.\u201d arms curling in on herself as she eyed him from head to toe. \u201cUnless you are into that sort of thing\u2026 and it is the reason you need to see a doctor\u2026\u201d</p><p>At this point the others stopped fighting in holding back their laughter. As for the teen next to her, he was now making a sound that was a cross between a cough and wheeze. Shaking her head, she began to turn when she felt the beginnings of magic gathering in the air. The cultural differences was too much on top of readjusting to all that she missed while time traveling.</p><p>\u201cMiko. It\u2019s a pleasure to see you again.\u201d a tall man stepped through a spinning and sparking portal, smiling as he made his way to where they all stood.</p><p>Smiling in return, Kagome bowed to the man. \u201cDoctor Strange. I do believe this one belongs to you.\u201d she pulled a black pouch from the loose belt around her waist to give to him.</p><p>\u201cWait. You know this brat?\u201d the man turned to the doctor in question. He thumbed towards her in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cStark.\u201d he gave a slight nod in greeting. \u201cAnd yes. We travel in the same circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa.\u201d Stark waved his hands as he made the short distance between him and the doctor. \u201cYou travel in the same circles with magical spider girl here?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Doctor Strange shook his head as he tucked the black pouch securely beneath his cloak. \u201cThe rare few of use that take up the mantel to protect this world from the more mystical get to know one another rather quickly. The Miko here, is one such individual.\u201d her attention returned to said young woman with a smile. \u201cAgain, thank you for the assistance on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I was of assistance.\u201d she offered a respectful bow to the man. \u201cWould it be too much to ask for some help back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d he shook his head, turning to face the empty space he had appeared from just a few minutes ago. His hands were already in the familiar motions that was part of the spell he was casting. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she spun about to face the others she had crossed paths with on this latest\u2026 mission. She was still unsure what to call these superhero outings. \u201cIt was a pleasure meeting you all.

He still got embarrassed at being reminded of all the times he hugged Tony by accident.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2026 another spider hero\u2026\u201d Clint chuckled as he shook his head, fingers quickly tapping away at his cell to send the pictures he took to the others, much to Tony\u2019s chagrin. \u201cOne that can trip you up and not even on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll cross paths again. Seems like a sweet kid.\u201d Natasha commented as the began to make their way back to the Avengers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only saying that because she tripped Tony up.\u201d Clint remarked, chuckling at the amused look the redheaded woman gave him.</p><p>\u201cEither way, you know Fury\u2019s gonna want to know all that we can on her.\u201d they continued on until they reached their respective motorcycles. \u201cThat she can trip Tony is just a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kid?\u201d Clint watched as his preferred partner started up her bike.</p><p>\u201cAgain, a bonus. Albeit an adorable one.\u201d the flipped their sunglasses down and took off down the street. Hoping the next time they did meet the girl, it would prove just as entertaining.</p>",
                "content": "<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo; she stared at the man, utterly lost with what he began to say the moment things calmed down. She bet it had to do with both cultural differences and her lack of understanding what was &lsquo;In&rsquo; with everyone else.</p><p>Since the end of the Shikon, which she and her friends had won the battle against Naraku, Kagome had returned home changed in more ways than she thought possible. Apparently, the prolonged exposure to Naraku&rsquo;s miasma had been lethal enough to alter her. Giving her abilities a more spider-like qualities.</p><p>Much to her disgust.</p><p>After everything, she went through and survived, she didn&rsquo;t take too kindly to learning via the powers that are, that she herself would be more spider-like.</p><p>So when she was returned home, and realized that there was no going back, it was then that some old friends approached her. And more or less turned her into a superhero. It made for keeping the more supernatural elements of Tokyo in line easier to understand for the public eye.</p><p>Only this time, she ended up in New York and crossing paths with the city&rsquo;s own heroes. Including another spider based hero.</p><p>Turning to said hero, just a tad taller than herself, she attempted to communicate with them silently. She wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was to get a definition of what the man was saying, or to get him to leave her alone.</p><p>The young man in question scratched at the back of his head, shrugging as he chuckled beneath his own mask. &ldquo;Haha-ah&hellip; yeah.&rdquo;</p><p>Turning to the armored man, she crossed her arms over her chest. &ldquo;Can you repeat that please? This time use words I can understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Use words&hellip; Are you serious?&rdquo; the suit landed with a heavy clunk, the face plate lifting and the entire helmet retracting to reveal the man beneath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re how old, and don&rsquo;t know what a meme is?&rdquo;</p><p>Brows furrowing, Kagome shook her head. &ldquo;Sorry. I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A meme.&rdquo; when his brows furrowed, lips screwing at her continued lack of response, he narrowed his eyes. &ldquo;A meme! An online movement that spreads like virus!&rdquo;</p><p>Blanching, Kagome leaned back. &ldquo;You should see a doctor for that!&rdquo;</p><p>A few of the other heroes off to the side attempted to cover their amusement at her response. Snorting and coughing to outright hide their laughter, one whipping away when the man turned on them to level them with a glare. The others were far too interested in watching the proceedings.</p><p>&ldquo;Not an STD!&rdquo; the man all but exploded, cheeks uncharacteristically flushed in slight embarrassment. No thanks to a teenie bopper. &ldquo;An online trend! Something that pretty much teens redo and remake to continue it on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; she remembers Souta showing her some things he thought she might find funny on the internet. The ones where student were remaking a famous anime character&rsquo;s signature battle move amused her. Kam-mama-something or other. &ldquo;And what was the one you mentioned again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tide Pod Challenge!&rdquo; he ran an armored hand over his face, sighing at having to explain the joke to a teen of all people. It was no longer funny. And he wasn&rsquo;t enjoying how it was being turned against him.</p><p>&ldquo;Never heard of such a challenge.&rdquo; Kagome tapped at her chin, thankful that the mask she had been supplied with covered the upper half of her face and not her entire face. She wasn&rsquo;t sure how the other teen did it, breathing and speaking through the tight material. &ldquo;Is it anything like that ice bucket challenge?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the other teen finally jumped in, arms waving about and drawing her attention. &ldquo;Tide Pods are these little packets you put in a dishwasher, they contain soaps. Apparently some people thought their new design made them look&hellip; delicious? And then challenged themselves and others to eating one?&rdquo;</p><p>Kagome reeled back once more. &ldquo;What? Why?!&rdquo; she spun about to face the man again, lips dipped down in a frown as the mask did hinder the use of facial expressions. &ldquo;You think I did something stupid and dangerous to get these&hellip; these&hellip; these spider abilities?!&rdquo; she waved her hands the teen next to her. &ldquo;That he started something and I thought, &lsquo;why not, seems fun&rsquo; and followed suit?!&rdquo;</p><p>Brown eyes blinked widely down at her, obviously not ready for the outburst. &ldquo;Well&hellip; you teens are crazy. I mean, her ran around in old sweaters and wrestling masks when he first started out. Like that hid his identity. Right, buddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!&rdquo; the teen leaned in closer, raising a hand in an attempt to hinder her from hearing his words. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, we already all know.&rdquo; the man gave the red and blue clad teen a pointed look. With a shake of his head, he turned to look at her again. &ldquo;Look, shouldn&rsquo;t you be all&hellip; magical girl with glittery powers and as far away from spider for a teen hero from Tokyo?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Magical girls are for entertainment in the form of manga or anime. Last I checked this is real life.&rdquo; arms curling in on herself as she eyed him from head to toe. &ldquo;Unless you are into that sort of thing&hellip; and it is the reason you need to see a doctor&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>At this point the others stopped fighting in holding back their laughter. As for the teen next to her, he was now making a sound that was a cross between a cough and wheeze. Shaking her head, she began to turn when she felt the beginnings of magic gathering in the air. The cultural differences was too much on top of readjusting to all that she missed while time traveling.</p><p>&ldquo;Miko. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to see you again.&rdquo; a tall man stepped through a spinning and sparking portal, smiling as he made his way to where they all stood.</p><p>Smiling in return, Kagome bowed to the man. &ldquo;Doctor Strange. I do believe this one belongs to you.&rdquo; she pulled a black pouch from the loose belt around her waist to give to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. You know this brat?&rdquo; the man turned to the doctor in question. He thumbed towards her in disbelief.</p><p>&ldquo;Stark.&rdquo; he gave a slight nod in greeting. &ldquo;And yes. We travel in the same circles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, whoa.&rdquo; Stark waved his hands as he made the short distance between him and the doctor. &ldquo;You travel in the same circles with magical spider girl here?&rdquo;</p><p>With a sigh, Doctor Strange shook his head as he tucked the black pouch securely beneath his cloak. &ldquo;The rare few of use that take up the mantel to protect this world from the more mystical get to know one another rather quickly. The Miko here, is one such individual.&rdquo; her attention returned to said young woman with a smile. &ldquo;Again, thank you for the assistance on this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I was of assistance.&rdquo; she offered a respectful bow to the man. &ldquo;Would it be too much to ask for some help back home?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; he shook his head, turning to face the empty space he had appeared from just a few minutes ago. His hands were already in the familiar motions that was part of the spell he was casting. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she spun about to face the others she had crossed paths with on this latest&hellip; mission. She was still unsure what to call these superhero outings. &ldquo;It was a pleasure meeting you all. Ja ne!&rdquo; with a bow, she joined Doctor Strange to stepping through the portal back to Tokyo.</p><p>&ldquo;So, how do it feel to be out-sassed by a teenie bopper magical girl, Tony?&rdquo; Natasha smirked as she strolled over to the other man, leaning against the still suited man.</p><p>&ldquo;Stuff it, Natasha.&rdquo; Tony waved a hand as if to shoo her away.</p><p>Clint chuckled, leaning into Natasha&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s still embarrassed and blushing!&rdquo; he was quick to whip out his cell phone and snapping a few pictures. &ldquo;Gotta save these. It&rsquo;s not every day that the great Tony Stark gets embarrassed by a teen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speaking of teens&hellip;&rdquo; Natasha trailed off, lifting her chin in the direction of their own teen superhero. &ldquo;You okay there, Spider-Man?&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing the lilting and teasing tone, Spider-Man jumped back to attention, scanning the others as they all stared at him. &ldquo;Yeah.
