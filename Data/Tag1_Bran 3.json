I\u2019ve adored watching Sansa grow and I wanted to see her be the one to bring down Cersei more so than Dany because Sansa had a history and relationship with Cersei that Dany didn\u2019t. I wanted her to be the Queen\u00a0\u2018younger and prettier\u2019 who takes the throne from Cersei LIKE THE SEVEN FACED GOD DAMN PROPHECY.

And that\u2019s not to say we haven\u2019t seen glimpses of Sansa being a good ruler and caring for her people - we have - but they were glimpses, always in the background, mostly used to points of arguments between her and Dany or her and Jon. Compare the three\u00a0\u201cKing/Queen in the North!\u201d scenes. For Robb and Jon, they were chosen by their people. They made no claim or push for royalty or independence - the North loved them and chose them.

We don\u2019t see anyone CHOOSING her as the Queen apart from herself and her own brother (if he\u2019s even still that) giving her the okay about it. Even the knight sworn to protect her has left her side! We don\u2019t really see Sansa do anything this season that really showed her lessons and growth be for anything heroic - aside from giving the North independence. She\u2019s mainly there as a rival for Dany, then not doing anything in the crypt - even at the Battle of Blackwater she was trying to keep everyones spirits up! - and then becoming an Oathbreaker and all her family leaving her again.</p><p>Tl;dr - Bran deserved better.
