In fact, Show!Sansa goes as far as to condemn the Umbers and the Karstarks as <i><b>traitors</b></i> and argued their lands be given to <i><b>loyal lords</b></i>. <br/></p><p>You\u2019d think the bannermen would know show!Sansa does not tread lightly around treason, but I guess because she disagreed with Jon, like, twice I guess, they thought she was radical enough to usurp her own brother for her claim. </p><p><strike>Not to mention they don\u2019t even hold a secret meeting or try to spin Sansa into this discretely or treat it as the big-fucking-deal it is, they actually brought up an usurpation plot on open court, which in itself is ridiculous because anyone could have just walked in and witnessed treason, and SOMEONE, Arya, did walk in.</strike></p><p>And what\u2019s worst, the script insinuates that Sansa is actually considering this. In their time and age and setting, this was an <i>OUTRAGEOUS</i> and treasonous claim to make! so! for! Sansa! to! not! have! said! anything! is! <i>nearly</i>! as! outrageous! </p><p>Arya\u2019s reaction \u201cmaybe we should kill these traitors\u201d is a bit too cruel on the political side, but not entirely radical and a maybe a more fitting reaction than Sansa\u2019s, but it is still super INSULTING to Arya\u2019s character to once again reduce her as an impulsive killer this is just not Arya at all. Her character is painfully warped to fit their drama needs and not even consistent with the show plot.</p><p>Then again, I get Show!Sansa\u2019s point of view: \u201c<i>We need these lords\u2019 support, so therefore we must graciously brush off their </i><i><b>suggestion of a coup</b> to keep in their good faith.\u201d</i></p><p>But the show is treating the bannermen as modern representatives who are giving in support to their leader;<b> </b>it\u2019s not like that. <b>The bannermen answer to their Liege for protection, not the other way around. </b></p><p>By breaking the political groundwork on which the North works and then dumbing down the Lords of the North, the show has staged a very shaky base for the Sansa-Arya drama to rely on.</p><p>That dumb and unstable and inconsistent plot being that Arya believes Sansa is power-hungry enough usurp their brother, while Sansa believes her sister is . . \u00a0. trying to kill her. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"260\" data-orig-height=\"195\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a757406c495dc00ca4b956d448d41e4/tumblr_inline_pjidldZ9hu1v7vbmq_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"260\" data-orig-height=\"195\"/></figure><p>There is a lot to unload here.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"964\" data-orig-height=\"1146\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/98e24a0ef182655d543a2cfce3e02512/tumblr_inline_pjidl5Byt01v7vbmq_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"964\" data-orig-height=\"1146\"/></figure><p>Sansa does not handle it well, but it is not set up well for her to react correctly in the first place. The show treats this as a reasonable possibility, in which all Sansa has to do is kindly decline. </p><p>I\u2019m NOT saying Sansa\u2019s point of view is entirely wrong, she has a good point. The North must stay united to face winter, and she must thread carefully, but she did not handle it well.</p><p>Here is a similar situation that actually took place in Fire and Blood so you can have an idea of what Sansa could have done instead:</p><p>Quick briefing: 15 year old King Jaehaerys ran off to Dragonstone with his sister Alysanne and eloped against the wishes of his mother, the Regent Queen, and his Ruling Hand, Lord Rogar Baratheon. </p><p>Instead of being reasonable, the angry Rogar Baratheon (<strike>PRIVATELY AS PLOYS ARE FUCKING DONE</strike>) insists that Jaehaerys must be set aside as a Maester and concocts a plan to put his niece Aerea Targaryen on the throne. </p><p>His plan did not get far, and it failed in every attempt to usurp Jaehaerys or put Aerea on the throne. Rogar is brought to court to answer for his treason. </p><p>Jaehaerys acts wisely, and askin to what Sansa could have done to avoid war and resolve the conflict:</p><ul><li>King Jaehaerys ACKNOWLEDGES that Rogar had ill intentions and spoke treasonous words, but also admits that \u201cwords are wind\u201d and that because the usurpation never took place, there is no need to punish a treason that never took place.<br/></li><li>King Jaehaerys STRIPS the Hand of the King office forever from Rogar and, </li><li>Instead of brushing off his treason entirely, PARDONS HIM in front of the court, and URGES Rogar to abide by his peace and swear fealty to him and his queen</li><li>When Rogar asked what happened to the men who did take action in a coup, Jaehaerys exiled them (not as hard as the Night\u2019s Watch for life) and vowed to pardon them after ten years</li><li>When Rogar asked is the king needed hostages to ensure loyalty, Jaehaerys made a kind and graceful show of his dragon before proceeding to say that no hostages were needed. This was an unspoken threat \u201cwhilst [Jaehaerys] rides him, every man, maid and child in the Stormlands is [his] hostage.\u201d</li></ul><p>In her case, Sansa might had the power to be reasonably angry against them, bid them to never speak of it again, take a couple hostages as to avoid the satisfying \u201ccutting heads off.\u201d </p><p>But I guess drama gotta drama and girls gotta have a standoff for any nice encounter, so \u2026 politically and culturally speaking, Arya was right, but the show did not make a good point to show how big of a deal their suggestion really was, so Sansa\u2019s reaction can also be interpreted as reasonable to the viewer and I wouldn\u2019t blame them. </p><p>There is also this section:</p><p><i>\u201cSansa gets ticked off watching her sister and Brienne spar in the courtyard, and worries Brienne might be an ally for her sister should Arya turn on Sansa. \u201cSansa is not happy about it\u201d the script reads. Furthermore: \u201cThis disturbs Sansa; <b>the woman she thought was her dedicated protector is actually a time share.</b>\u201d That\u2019s why Sansa abruptly, and unkindly, sends Brienne away.\u201d</i></p><p>which is also pretty big YIKES and I\u2019m not going to even poke it with a stick or try to dissect it just because how utterly YIKES it is. </p><p>Conclusion? Sansa and Arya Stark are awesome characters (that love each other!) who have been sliced off and sloppily rebooted to fit the show\u2019s drama needs, and this plot does nothing to favor one character on another and only acts as a cheap time-waster to keep us \u201con the edge of our seats.\u201d </p>",

Her character is painfully warped to fit their drama needs and not even consistent with the show plot.</p><p>Then again, I get Show!Sansa\u2019s point of view: \u201c<i>We need these lords\u2019 support, so therefore we must graciously brush off their </i><i><b>suggestion of a coup</b> to keep in their good faith.\u201d</i></p><p>But the show is treating the bannermen as modern representatives who are giving in support to their leader;<b> </b>it\u2019s not like that. <b>The bannermen answer to their Liege for protection, not the other way around. </b></p><p>By breaking the political groundwork on which the North works and then dumbing down the Lords of the North, the show has staged a very shaky base for the Sansa-Arya drama to rely on.</p><p>That dumb and unstable and inconsistent plot being that Arya believes Sansa is power-hungry enough usurp their brother, while Sansa believes her sister is . . \u00a0. trying to kill her. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"260\" data-orig-height=\"195\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a757406c495dc00ca4b956d448d41e4/tumblr_inline_pjidldZ9hu1v7vbmq_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"260\" data-orig-height=\"195\"></figure><p>There is a lot to unload here.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"964\" data-orig-height=\"1146\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/98e24a0ef182655d543a2cfce3e02512/tumblr_inline_pjidl5Byt01v7vbmq_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"964\" data-orig-height=\"1146\"></figure><p>Sansa does not handle it well, but it is not set up well for her to react correctly in the first place. The show treats this as a reasonable possibility, in which all Sansa has to do is kindly decline. </p><p>I\u2019m NOT saying Sansa\u2019s point of view is entirely wrong, she has a good point. The North must stay united to face winter, and she must thread carefully, but she did not handle it well.</p><p>Here is a similar situation that actually took place in Fire and Blood so you can have an idea of what Sansa could have done instead:</p><p>Quick briefing: 15 year old King Jaehaerys ran off to Dragonstone with his sister Alysanne and eloped against the wishes of his mother, the Regent Queen, and his Ruling Hand, Lord Rogar Baratheon. </p><p>Instead of being reasonable, the angry Rogar Baratheon (<strike>PRIVATELY AS PLOYS ARE FUCKING DONE</strike>) insists that Jaehaerys must be set aside as a Maester and concocts a plan to put his niece Aerea Targaryen on the throne. </p><p>His plan did not get far, and it failed in every attempt to usurp Jaehaerys or put Aerea on the throne. Rogar is brought to court to answer for his treason. </p><p>Jaehaerys acts wisely, and askin to what Sansa could have done to avoid war and resolve the conflict:</p><ul><li>King Jaehaerys ACKNOWLEDGES that Rogar had ill intentions and spoke treasonous words, but also admits that \u201cwords are wind\u201d and that because the usurpation never took place, there is no need to punish a treason that never took place.<br></li><li>King Jaehaerys STRIPS the Hand of the King office forever from Rogar and, </li><li>Instead of brushing off his treason entirely, PARDONS HIM in front of the court, and URGES Rogar to abide by his peace and swear fealty to him and his queen</li><li>When Rogar asked what happened to the men who did take action in a coup, Jaehaerys exiled them (not as hard as the Night\u2019s Watch for life) and vowed to pardon them after ten years</li><li>When Rogar asked is the king needed hostages to ensure loyalty, Jaehaerys made a kind and graceful show of his dragon before proceeding to say that no hostages were needed. This was an unspoken threat \u201cwhilst [Jaehaerys] rides him, every man, maid and child in the Stormlands is [his] hostage.\u201d</li></ul><p>In her case, Sansa might had the power to be reasonably angry against them, bid them to never speak of it again, take a couple hostages as to avoid the satisfying \u201ccutting heads off.\u201d </p><p>But I guess drama gotta drama and girls gotta have a standoff for any nice encounter, so \u2026 politically and culturally speaking, Arya was right, but the show did not make a good point to show how big of a deal their suggestion really was, so Sansa\u2019s reaction can also be interpreted as reasonable to the viewer and I wouldn\u2019t blame them. </p><p>There is also this section:</p><p><i>\u201cSansa gets ticked off watching her sister and Brienne spar in the courtyard, and worries Brienne might be an ally for her sister should Arya turn on Sansa. \u201cSansa is not happy about it\u201d the script reads. Furthermore: \u201cThis disturbs Sansa; <b>the woman she thought was her dedicated protector is actually a time share.</b>\u201d That\u2019s why Sansa abruptly, and unkindly, sends Brienne away.\u201d</i></p><p>which is also pretty big YIKES and I\u2019m not going to even poke it with a stick or try to dissect it just because how utterly YIKES it is. </p><p>Conclusion? Sansa and Arya Stark are awesome characters (that love each other!) who have been sliced off and sloppily rebooted to fit the show\u2019s drama needs, and this plot does nothing to favor one character on another and only acts as a cheap time-waster to keep us \u201con the edge of our seats.\u201d </p>",

Sansa! to! not! have! said! anything! is! <i>nearly</i>! as! outrageous! </p><p>Arya&rsquo;s reaction &ldquo;maybe we should kill these traitors&rdquo; is a bit too cruel on the political side, but not entirely radical and a maybe a more fitting reaction than Sansa&rsquo;s, but it is still super INSULTING to Arya&rsquo;s character to once again reduce her as an impulsive killer this is just not Arya at all. Her character is painfully warped to fit their drama needs and not even consistent with the show plot.</p><p>Then again, I get Show!Sansa&rsquo;s point of view: &ldquo;<i>We need these lords&rsquo; support, so therefore we must graciously brush off their </i><i><b>suggestion of a coup</b> to keep in their good faith.&rdquo;</i></p><p>But the show is treating the bannermen as modern representatives who are giving in support to their leader;<b> </b>it&rsquo;s not like that. <b>The bannermen answer to their Liege for protection, not the other way around. </b></p><p>By breaking the political groundwork on which the North works and then dumbing down the Lords of the North, the show has staged a very shaky base for the Sansa-Arya drama to rely on.</p><p>That dumb and unstable and inconsistent plot being that Arya believes Sansa is power-hungry enough usurp their brother, while Sansa believes her sister is . . &nbsp;. trying to kill her. </p><figure><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a757406c495dc00ca4b956d448d41e4/tumblr_inline_pjidldZ9hu1v7vbmq_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is a lot to unload here.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/98e24a0ef182655d543a2cfce3e02512/tumblr_inline_pjidl5Byt01v7vbmq_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Sansa does not handle it well, but it is not set up well for her to react correctly in the first place. The show treats this as a reasonable possibility, in which all Sansa has to do is kindly decline. </p><p>I&rsquo;m NOT saying Sansa&rsquo;s point of view is entirely wrong, she has a good point. The North must stay united to face winter, and she must thread carefully, but she did not handle it well.</p><p>Here is a similar situation that actually took place in Fire and Blood so you can have an idea of what Sansa could have done instead:</p><p>Quick briefing: 15 year old King Jaehaerys ran off to Dragonstone with his sister Alysanne and eloped against the wishes of his mother, the Regent Queen, and his Ruling Hand, Lord Rogar Baratheon. </p><p>Instead of being reasonable, the angry Rogar Baratheon (<strike>PRIVATELY AS PLOYS ARE FUCKING DONE</strike>) insists that Jaehaerys must be set aside as a Maester and concocts a plan to put his niece Aerea Targaryen on the throne. </p><p>His plan did not get far, and it failed in every attempt to usurp Jaehaerys or put Aerea on the throne. Rogar is brought to court to answer for his treason. </p><p>Jaehaerys acts wisely, and askin to what Sansa could have done to avoid war and resolve the conflict:</p><ul><li>King Jaehaerys ACKNOWLEDGES that Rogar had ill intentions and spoke treasonous words, but also admits that &ldquo;words are wind&rdquo; and that because the usurpation never took place, there is no need to punish a treason that never took place.<br /></li><li>King Jaehaerys STRIPS the Hand of the King office forever from Rogar and, </li><li>Instead of brushing off his treason entirely, PARDONS HIM in front of the court, and URGES Rogar to abide by his peace and swear fealty to him and his queen</li><li>When Rogar asked what happened to the men who did take action in a coup, Jaehaerys exiled them (not as hard as the Night&rsquo;s Watch for life) and vowed to pardon them after ten years</li><li>When Rogar asked is the king needed hostages to ensure loyalty, Jaehaerys made a kind and graceful show of his dragon before proceeding to say that no hostages were needed. This was an unspoken threat &ldquo;whilst [Jaehaerys] rides him, every man, maid and child in the Stormlands is [his] hostage.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>In her case, Sansa might had the power to be reasonably angry against them, bid them to never speak of it again, take a couple hostages as to avoid the satisfying &ldquo;cutting heads off.&rdquo; </p><p>But I guess drama gotta drama and girls gotta have a standoff for any nice encounter, so &hellip; politically and culturally speaking, Arya was right, but the show did not make a good point to show how big of a deal their suggestion really was, so Sansa&rsquo;s reaction can also be interpreted as reasonable to the viewer and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame them. </p><p>There is also this section:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Sansa gets ticked off watching her sister and Brienne spar in the courtyard, and worries Brienne might be an ally for her sister should Arya turn on Sansa. &ldquo;Sansa is not happy about it&rdquo; the script reads. Furthermore: &ldquo;This disturbs Sansa; <b>the woman she thought was her dedicated protector is actually a time share.</b>&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why Sansa abruptly, and unkindly, sends Brienne away.&rdquo;</i></p><p>which is also pretty big YIKES and I&rsquo;m not going to even poke it with a stick or try to dissect it just because how utterly YIKES it is. </p><p>Conclusion? Sansa and Arya Stark are awesome characters (that love each other!) who have been sliced off and sloppily rebooted to fit the show&rsquo;s drama needs, and this plot does nothing to favor one character on another and only acts as a cheap time-waster to keep us &ldquo;on the edge of our seats.&rdquo; </p>",
