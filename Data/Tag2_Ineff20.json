Crowley asking aziraphale to run away with him. Aziraphale FULLY tearing up because of how much it hurts him to say no. I hate it. when the show first got leaked I only managed to see up to here before the first code got cut off and I had to go outside and scream and punch a hedge. I HATE it</p><p><b>5) Nazi church:</b> I know we&rsquo;ve sort of got over this at this point but I would like to reiterate: CROWLEY RAN INTO A FUCKING CHURCH TO SAVE AZIRAPHALE FROM A GANG OF FUCKING NAZIS, THREW AN ENTIRE AIR RAID OFF COURSE TO HAVE THEM BOMB THE CHURCH INSTEAD, AND STILL TOOK THE TIME TO SAVE AZIRAPHALE&rsquo;S STUPID BOOKS. this is literally the moment Douglas and Michael said aziraphale realised he was in love with crowley!!!!!!! i! am!! feral!!!!</p><p><b>4) 1967, aka the holy water scene:</b> seven words. You Go Too Fast For Me, Crowley</p><p><b>3) when Crowley is drunk in the bar and aziraphale finds him:</b> bro I cannot even begin to articulate what this scene makes me feel&hellip;.like I probably could if I took some time but two slow dancers by mitski is playing as I&rsquo;m writing this and i&rsquo;m about to have a heart attack so like. just trust me. it Does It To Me every time. everything about it like. this was the moment it went from subtext to just being Right Fucking There&hellip;.. the music&hellip;.. David&rsquo;s ACTING&hellip;&hellip; &ldquo;I lost my best friend&rdquo;&hellip;.. &ldquo;WHEREVER YOU ARE, I&rsquo;LL COME TO YOU&rdquo;??????? it&rsquo;s so much man I can&rsquo;t even think about it just trust me it&rsquo;s the best scene in the show shut up</p><p><b>2) when they&rsquo;re sat on a bench in tadfield waiting for the bus:</b> I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again: THE ABSOLUTE REPRESSION OF IT ALL!!!!!! my heart ACHES just thinking about aziraphale&rsquo;s face journeys after crowley invites him to stay with him. the YEARNING. the FEAR. the TENDERNESS. this is the one scene I still can&rsquo;t watch without tearing up. it&rsquo;s fucking unreal man. the track that plays behind it is called &ldquo;life after death&rdquo; and it makes me crave exactly that but without the life part</p><p><b>1) &ldquo;to the world&rdquo;: </b>THAT CERTAIN NIGHT&hellip; THE NIGHT WE MET&hellip; THERE WAS MAGIC ABROAD IN THE AIR&hellip;..

No, don\u2019t answer. We should get you cleaned up first. The miracle way or the human way?\u2019<br/></p><p>\u2018You offering to do the dirty work, angel?\u2019 Crowley looked surprised behind his designer (part of the new collection, which oddly, looked almost exactly like the previous one but cost twice as much) sunglasses. \u2018I thought you were utterly and imperishably opposed to frivolous miracles or something to that effect.\u2019</p><p>\u2018This is no frivolous matter,\u2019 Aziraphale looked affronted by the thought, and also seemed to determinedly ignore the fact that Crowley had indeed perfectly quoted him, haughty tone and all. He concentrated carefully, and within minutes, every millimetre of Crowley was pristine.</p><p>The demon looked down and tutted at the new shoes and tie that had so miraculously appeared on his person. \u2018Angel. We\u2019ve talked about this. I don\u2019t go updating your wardrobe* even though it desperately needs it.\u2019(*The anymore was left unsaid, they both clearly remembered the absolute disaster of a row they\u2019d had when Crowley had replaced his favourite angel\u2019s tartan tie and trousers with leather and studs.)</p><p>\u2018Oh yes, terribly sorry,\u2019 Aziraphale sheepishly returned them to normal. He flipped the Closed sign to face outwards and bolted the shop door, despite having only just opened, and led Crowley into the back room, dithering about between the coffee maker and the wine before finally settling on the coffee maker and pulling out some alcoholised coffee additive. \u2018Sit down, dear, sit, and tell me all about what in the world happened.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Not much to tell,\u2019 Crowley shrugged, watching the angel fuss with the coffee cups as he waited for the coffee to brew fondly. He thought it was incredibly endearing the way the angel still made such a fuss over such a silly thing as coffee to offer well, what amounted to his only guest that ever dropped by. He knew it was simply a deeply-ingrained part of who the angel was to be a good host, but Crowley hoped at least some of it was out of care and deference to Crowley himself.</p><p>\u2018Well, tell me the not much anyways,\u2019 Aziraphale prompted, pouring and spiking their coffees and heading over to perch on the sofa next to Crowley, handing him the coffee.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/19143349\"><b>Keep reading on AO3</b></a>!]</p>",
