Nothing says Orcs can&rsquo;t be charismatic, of course, but if that is his Elvish side poking through that could be a cheeky hint.</p><p>It would be even more interesting to know how Fjord himself would react to finding this out though. Right now Fjord&rsquo;s story is also very much about self-acceptance, and specifically about accepting his orc side while having grown up in a mostly human society where people would poke fun at him.&nbsp;</p><p>I think he&rsquo;s quite curious about his orc heritage and we&rsquo;ve seen him wanting to talk to orcs to learn more, so I think this background is quite an important part of his identity and story. But suddenly he&rsquo;s going to learn he&rsquo;s a quarter elf, too? What does that mean for his identity? He&rsquo;s going to be such a confused boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I do wonder what other traits he picked up with this background though, because jeez, this is a mixed bag ancestry.

Most of what we think we know, we only know through the rose-colored glasses of Nott. I do trust Nott\u2019s judgement, especially as a victim of bullying most of her life which would probably mean she has a good nose for sniffing out insincerity. But we also know she can be\u2026 hyperbolic at times.\u00a0</p><p>Do I think Yeza is a kind man? Yes. But I don\u2019t know how streetwise he is. We don\u2019t know why Yeza was working with the Cerberus Assembly on their research. Was he coerced? Or was it voluntary? If it was voluntary, was it because he didn\u2019t care about the potential harmful consequences of his work, and the military uses? Or was he oblivious and ignorant to it?\u00a0</p><p>I think in that last case, we would have a bit of bumbling Yeza; One who is kind, caring and book-smart but maybe not very wise at all. A bit oblivious. I think that Yeza would be very relieved to be rescued, but maybe not even realize how much trouble he was potentially in. I also think he wouldn\u2019t give two shits that his wife is a goblin now, because all that matters is that she\u2019s back. Can you imagine having a loved one come back from the dead, but just in another body? You have to be extraordinarily callous to reject them, and I really don\u2019t think Yeza is.\u00a0</p><p>However, if Yeza was coerced to work with the Assembly, he\u2019d maybe be whole lot less ignorant. He\u2019d also very grateful to be rescued, because he\u2019d know exactly what shitstorm he\u2019d landed in. On the other hand, he might also be suspicious of being suddenly released; who are these people he\u2019s never seen before? Why do they care about him and want to free him? Are they with the Assembly? Or is this another trick by the Kryn?\u00a0</p><p>And also, if he was immediately introduced to his \u2018dead wife\u2019, now returned as Goblin\u2026. Well, how can he be sure she\u2019s actually who she claims she is? What if it is a ploy to gain his trust?\u00a0Their first few conversations might be\u2026 strained, to say the least.\u00a0</p><p>As for Nott, I think the time for deception has kind of come and gone, whatever she had planned. Jester has made references to Yeza through sending that his wife is looking for him. Nott screamed to a full court of people that Yeza is her husband. If Yeza were to be freed by the Kryn because the M9 did them such a great favour, there\u2019s a high chance they might mention he\u2019s being released because his wife requested it.\u00a0</p><p>I still think Nott is feeling incredibly apprehensive about the whole thing, so might slink into the background at first, or maybe even use disguise self to make herself look like Veth.

We don&rsquo;t know why Yeza was working with the Cerberus Assembly on their research. Was he coerced? Or was it voluntary? If it was voluntary, was it because he didn&rsquo;t care about the potential harmful consequences of his work, and the military uses? Or was he oblivious and ignorant to it?&nbsp;</p><p>I think in that last case, we would have a bit of bumbling Yeza; One who is kind, caring and book-smart but maybe not very wise at all. A bit oblivious. I think that Yeza would be very relieved to be rescued, but maybe not even realize how much trouble he was potentially in. I also think he wouldn&rsquo;t give two shits that his wife is a goblin now, because all that matters is that she&rsquo;s back. Can you imagine having a loved one come back from the dead, but just in another body? You have to be extraordinarily callous to reject them, and I really don&rsquo;t think Yeza is.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if Yeza was coerced to work with the Assembly, he&rsquo;d maybe be whole lot less ignorant. He&rsquo;d also very grateful to be rescued, because he&rsquo;d know exactly what shitstorm he&rsquo;d landed in. On the other hand, he might also be suspicious of being suddenly released; who are these people he&rsquo;s never seen before? Why do they care about him and want to free him? Are they with the Assembly? Or is this another trick by the Kryn?&nbsp;</p><p>And also, if he was immediately introduced to his &lsquo;dead wife&rsquo;, now returned as Goblin&hellip;. Well, how can he be sure she&rsquo;s actually who she claims she is? What if it is a ploy to gain his trust?&nbsp;Their first few conversations might be&hellip; strained, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>As for Nott, I think the time for deception has kind of come and gone, whatever she had planned. Jester has made references to Yeza through sending that his wife is looking for him. Nott screamed to a full court of people that Yeza is her husband. If Yeza were to be freed by the Kryn because the M9 did them such a great favour, there&rsquo;s a high chance they might mention he&rsquo;s being released because his wife requested it.&nbsp;</p><p>I still think Nott is feeling incredibly apprehensive about the whole thing, so might slink into the background at first, or maybe even use disguise self to make herself look like Veth. But overall, she just&hellip; has to be honest eventually.</p>",
