The feather bed beneath her was too\nfluffy, the furs piled on top of her were too plush. Everything was too soft.</p><p>What a ridiculous predicament to be in. </p><p>Giving up on sleep, she shoved the covers aside and stood\nup, familiarizing her feet with the cold stone floor. <i>That\u2019s better</i>, she thought to herself. She slipped on the loose dress\nSansa had made for her, letting the garment slip over her shift. Arya didn\u2019t\nknow if she should be offended or grateful that her sister had made her such a\nsimple garment \u2013 it had no laces or clasps, similar to something a child would\nwear. Still, it allowed her to dress herself quickly and (if she was honest)\ndidn\u2019t look terrible on her. </p><p>She pulled on her boots and a heavy cloak before slipping\ninto the corridor. She didn\u2019t know where she was going, only that she needed to\nmove. She decided a walk along the battlements would do her good. </p><p>If the posted guards were surprised to see her stalking the perimeter\nof the castle in the middle of the night, they didn\u2019t show it. After everything\nthey\u2019d heard, it was hard to imagine much that would surprise them. She paused\na long moment at her favorite spot, from which she could see the full moon\nreflected in the hot springs in the Godswood. Most of the trees were bare of\nleaves, their naked branches spreading like veins against the sky. The image\nunsettled her.</p><p>Turning away, she caught sight of the forge. Despite the\nhour, smoke poured from the chimney in a steady stream. <i>What is he doing up at this hour?</i> Pulling her hood up, she changed\ncourse.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant to sneak up on him, but she was used to making\nno noise and he was making an awful lot of it when she pulled the door open and\nslipped inside. The gust of cold air made him turn his head just in time to see\nher silhouette doused in moonlight. </p><p>He nearly dropped the sword he was holding.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she chuckled, pulling her hood back so the fire\ncould illuminate her face properly. </p><p>\u201cGods, Arya. I thought the Stranger had finally come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if have any say in it.\u201d She realized her words too\nlate, hoping he wouldn\u2019t see the furious blush that flooded her cheeks. \u201cWhat\nare you doing up so late?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the sword he\u2019d been working on, examining\nhis progress with a discerning eye. \u201cI could ask you the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>That piqued his interest. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d she insisted. He motioned for her to go on\nthough, so she unfastened her cloak and hung it by the door, perching on one of\nthe work benches behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s my bed. I can\u2019t get comfortable. Everything\nis too\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoft,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cI know the feeling.\u201d<br/><br/>\nShe let out a short breath. \u201cI\u2019d go sleep on the ground in the Godswood if I\ndidn\u2019t think I\u2019d freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing we need is for you to join the ranks of the\ndead. We\u2019d be doomed,\u201d he said, setting the sword down and turning to look at\nher. Whatever he had been about to say never made it past his lips. Instead he\npaused, taking her in from head to toe. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>Arya didn\u2019t know why, but the question made her defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s\na dress, you idiot. Sansa made it for me.\u201d</p><p>Gendry balked. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get on than my breeches,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I <i>am</i> a woman, in case you forgot. I\u2019m\nallowed to wear a dress every once in a while. I can still kill a man while\nwearing a gown.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be struggling to pull his eyes away from the\ngarment in question. <i>I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d\nbe so damn shocked</i>, she thought bitterly. <i>It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got on a tiara.</i></p><p>\u201cTrust me Arya, nobody\u2019s forgotten that you\u2019re a woman,\u201d he\ngrumbled, peeling his eyes away and returning his attention to the sword on his\nwork bench. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d She had meant for it to be\nteasing, but the question came out biting instead. </p><p>\u201cGods, Arya\u2026do we have to do this now?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what <i>this</i>\nwas, but she very much wanted to find out. \u201cYes, Gendry, we do. What did you\nmean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re damn distracting! I spend most of the time I\u2019m\nwith you wishing you wore dresses so I could stop thinking terrible thoughts\nabout you, and then you show up here in a dress and it\u2019s no better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m not quite ladylike enough for you, <i>your lordship</i>,\u201d she spat, blood starting\nto boil. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to put on a finer gown next time we\u2019re sparring. Perhaps\nit will help you think less <i>terribly </i>of\nme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, Arya! Are you even listening to me? I\u2019m the terrible\none, not you.\u201d His voice had cracked on the last word and she realized he wasn\u2019t\nmad at her, but himself. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t think about you the way I do. You\u2019re my\nfriend, and a lady. I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about\u2026 what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the damn time,\u201d he breathed, running his hands over his\nshort hair. She was filled with the sudden impulse to do the same. It looked\nsoft\u2026</p><p>She closed her eyes, knowing she wouldn\u2019t be able to gather\nher thoughts with his bright blue eyes on her. \u201cWhat\u2026 do you think about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing you, for one thing\u2026\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open, immediately finding his. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d Even as she said it her heart strained against\nthe confines of her ribs. This could change everything between them, and yet\nher better sense couldn\u2019t talk her out of it. \u201cI want you to.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stillness, in which she realized he\nwas going to turn her down. Her heart barely had time to sink before he crossed\nthe space between them in two strides and granted her wish. It was everything\nand nothing like she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>His lips were firm against hers, taking and giving in equal\nmeasure as his big hands came to cradle the sides of her face. It was desperate\nand reverent all at once, as though he were begging the blessings of the gods\nwith his lips on hers. </p><p>She snaked her arms around his neck, desperately trying to\nbring him closer in any way she could. Their chests collided and she remembered\nthat there was nothing soft about him there. Absentmindedly, she let one hand\ndrift up to the black fuzz at the back of his neck and ran her fingers through\nit. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t as prickly as she\u2019d expected, and he moaned a\nlittle bit into her mouth when she tried to tug at it. </p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d She was teasing, but her labored breathing made\nit sound far less cocky than normal.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her throat, right where she would place\nher dagger to kill someone, and her breath hitched. \u201cJust wondering why you\nfelt the need to rip my hair out,\u201d he mumbled against her skin. His kisses\nstarted traveling lower and lower, towards the divot between her collarbones. </p><p>Arya felt like she was floating, relying purely on instinct\nas all sense took its leave. \u201cYou should grow it out again,\u201d she whispered,\ngasping when he tugged her braid in retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s soft.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against the base of her throat and what little\nsense she had left escaped her. \u201cAs m\u2019lady wishes.\u201d</p>",

I&rsquo;m\nallowed to wear a dress every once in a while. I can still kill a man while\nwearing a gown.&rdquo;</p><p>He seemed to be struggling to pull his eyes away from the\ngarment in question. <i>I didn&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;d\nbe so damn shocked</i>, she thought bitterly. <i>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve got on a tiara.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Trust me Arya, nobody&rsquo;s forgotten that you&rsquo;re a woman,&rdquo; he\ngrumbled, peeling his eyes away and returning his attention to the sword on his\nwork bench. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even if I wanted to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; She had meant for it to be\nteasing, but the question came out biting instead. </p><p>&ldquo;Gods, Arya&hellip;do we have to do this now?&rdquo;</p><p>She didn&rsquo;t know what <i>this</i>\nwas, but she very much wanted to find out. &ldquo;Yes, Gendry, we do. What did you\nmean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean you&rsquo;re damn distracting! I spend most of the time I&rsquo;m\nwith you wishing you wore dresses so I could stop thinking terrible thoughts\nabout you, and then you show up here in a dress and it&rsquo;s no better!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;m not quite ladylike enough for you, <i>your lordship</i>,&rdquo; she spat, blood starting\nto boil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be sure to put on a finer gown next time we&rsquo;re sparring. Perhaps\nit will help you think less <i>terribly </i>of\nme.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gods, Arya! Are you even listening to me? I&rsquo;m the terrible\none, not you.&rdquo; His voice had cracked on the last word and she realized he wasn&rsquo;t\nmad at her, but himself. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think about you the way I do. You&rsquo;re my\nfriend, and a lady. I shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about&hellip; what I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You think about me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the damn time,&rdquo; he breathed, running his hands over his\nshort hair. She was filled with the sudden impulse to do the same. It looked\nsoft&hellip;</p><p>She closed her eyes, knowing she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to gather\nher thoughts with his bright blue eyes on her. &ldquo;What&hellip; do you think about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kissing you, for one thing&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Her eyes flew open, immediately finding his. &ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Kiss me.&rdquo; Even as she said it her heart strained against\nthe confines of her ribs. This could change everything between them, and yet\nher better sense couldn&rsquo;t talk her out of it. &ldquo;I want you to.&rdquo;</p><p>There was a moment of stillness, in which she realized he\nwas going to turn her down. Her heart barely had time to sink before he crossed\nthe space between them in two strides and granted her wish. It was everything\nand nothing like she&rsquo;d imagined.</p><p>His lips were firm against hers, taking and giving in equal\nmeasure as his big hands came to cradle the sides of her face. It was desperate\nand reverent all at once, as though he were begging the blessings of the gods\nwith his lips on hers. </p><p>She snaked her arms around his neck, desperately trying to\nbring him closer in any way she could. Their chests collided and she remembered\nthat there was nothing soft about him there. Absentmindedly, she let one hand\ndrift up to the black fuzz at the back of his neck and ran her fingers through\nit. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t as prickly as she&rsquo;d expected, and he moaned a\nlittle bit into her mouth when she tried to tug at it. </p><p>&ldquo;Problem?&rdquo; She was teasing, but her labored breathing made\nit sound far less cocky than normal.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her throat, right where she would place\nher dagger to kill someone, and her breath hitched. &ldquo;Just wondering why you\nfelt the need to rip my hair out,&rdquo; he mumbled against her skin. His kisses\nstarted traveling lower and lower, towards the divot between her collarbones. </p><p>Arya felt like she was floating, relying purely on instinct\nas all sense took its leave. &ldquo;You should grow it out again,&rdquo; she whispered,\ngasping when he tugged her braid in retaliation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soft.&rdquo;</p><p>He chuckled against the base of her throat and what little\nsense she had left escaped her. &ldquo;As m&rsquo;lady wishes.&rdquo;</p>",

So sorry, if no one cares about this promo anymore.<br/></p><p>I\u2019m going to be talking about what I think the Crypt promo is hinting or foreshadowing at. But first\u2026</p><p>It is very interesting Sansa is made to be in the center at the end, especially since Jon is at first in the center - standing between both Arya and Sansa as the three meet up. </p><p>But then as they walk to their statues, he moves around Sansa to be on her side, which puts her in the center. This is a 100% deliberate choice, they could\u2019ve easily had them all walk straight towards their own statues with no rearrangements.</p><p>They literally have Jon stay behind Arya and Sansa and then move around Sansa, so he wouldn\u2019t be in the center.</p><p>So why? </p><p>One reasoning, is that it might actually be to avoid certain Targaryen imagery &ndash; specifically Aegon the Conqueror who in official art (?) and fan art is often flanked on both sides by his two-sister-wives. </p><p>The second, I imagined Jon being in the center, flanked on either side by his sisters, my mind went to Aegon and his sister-wives\u2026 so perhaps, it\u2019s best to avoid that idea altogether. Especially if you don\u2019t want your audience to be weirded out by Jon and Sansa (if I think what is happening is happening).</p><p>It could also be that visually Sansa is the tallest one, so it creates more of a symmetrical aesthetic.</p><p>Especially, when both Jon and Arya draw their swords to face the upcoming danger.</p><p>If Sansa was on the side as both Jon and Arya pull out their swords, that would\u2019ve sideline her from the action \u2013 keeping her in the center, keeps her in the scene.</p><p>It could also just be to cement the idea that Sansa is a major player to this season and to the end of the story.</p><p>Basically, from just a promo standpoint, it makes sense to put Sansa in the center, though this promo is all about Jon. Either just to avoid certain Targaryen visuals or to reinforce already existing ideas.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go into some of the story/plot-driven reasons for this promo and its choices (foreshadowing).</p><hr><!-- more --><figure data-orig-width=\"1500\" data-orig-height=\"843\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f92f3fb68a8327bdef7cfcaf30fc5fa/tumblr_inline_pnlim8goVd1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1500\" data-orig-height=\"843\"/></figure><p><br/>One idea (and I\u2019ve seen this a lot) is that this promo is hinting at the Winterfell Crypts residents waking up and attacking.

But this moment could also just be showing that Sansa is more vulnerable to outside threats, but nonetheless is protected by the Stark family.<br/></p><p>The two Starks that might be viewed by outsiders as \u201cwild-cards,\u201d the King who bent the knee and the girl who grew up to be a \u201cFaceless assassin,\u201d have no hesitation in standing against the upcoming threat and protecting their own.</p><p>The Starks are a unit or pack. </p><p>Also, while I\u2019ve brought it up, it is important to note that Jon was in the center, but moved to Sansa\u2019s side. This might be a stretch, but this might indicate that Jon is not the key to get the Stark Alliance.</p><p>Daenerys and her camp (as well as Cersei) both focused on Jon being the key to getting the North (which makes sense, he was the King). But Jon moving to the side, putting Sansa center and front, shows the audience who the central figure to the Stark Family is.</p><p>Which leads into the idea, that Sansa is central to the Starks\u2019 Future.</p><p>Multiple times she has been referred to as the Key to the North and has been viewed as the legitimate heir to Winterfell. And both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton (and Littlefinger) believed whoever sired a child with Sansa, would be in control of Winterfell as that child would be the future Lord.</p><p>So, Sansa is definitely a key to the future of House Starks in several ways.</p><p>The real interesting thing though, is this promo isn\u2019t about Sansa or even House Stark as a whole.</p><p>It\u2019s all about Jon.</p><p>All the lines pertain to him and it\u2019s about who he really is and his story, and yet Sansa still gets a lot of attention. More so than Arya, as the time between them isn\u2019t split evenly. Hinting that Sansa plays an important part to who Jon currently is, but also where his story and future are going.</p><p>And I know I keep repeating this, but it\u2019s odd to make Sansa the central character in the end \u2013 as</p><p>A. The Promo isn\u2019t about her<br/>B. Jon is a more central character to the story</p><p>But really a main idea that I think some people are overlooking, is that Jon is heavily connected to the Starks and their present and future. He is an integral part to the Stark Pack. </p><hr><p><b> The Intro Walks of Jon, Sansa and Arya.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"425\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34ad74068ea5014aa491ec6d81da8b55/tumblr_inline_pnlisdQenn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"425\"/></figure><p><b>Jon\u2019s 1<sup>st</sup> walk is 17/18 seconds long<br/></b><b>Jon\u2019s 2<sup>nd</sup> walk is 9 seconds long\u00a0</b></p><p><b>26/27 seconds altogether</b></p><p>He gets the most time and two separate walks to boot.</p><p>This makes sense, as he is the focus of this promo and is one of the biggest focuses of the show\u2019s overall story. </p><p>Jon walks right past Lyanna\u2019s statue. This is a reflection of Jon always wanting to know who his mother was, but was blind (lied to) about the truth. He walks right past the truth and his real mother and later pauses and stares directly at the man (Ned) he based so much on who he is now. </p><p>It is telling that Lyanna\u2019s line is spoken before Ned\u2019s though. </p><p>Indicating, that Jon will learn of his true parentage, falter in his identity, only to be reminded (by Ned\u2019s line) that he\u2019s never been a Stark in name and yet, has always been a Stark in blood. \u00a0</p><p>When Ned\u2019s Line is spoken and Jon is looking at Ned\u2019s Statue, it really does come across that Ned is directly talking to Jon in that moment. While Sansa also looks at Catelyn\u2019s statue, it\u2019s different as we don\u2019t get the impression she can hear Catelyn\u2019s words.</p><p>Jon can hear Ned\u2019s words. </p><p>Also Lyanna\u2019s line, while I think is reminding us of who \u201cJon really is\u201d isn\u2019t the one where she told Ned that Jon was Aegon Targaryen, instead it\u2019s her begging Ned to protect Jon.</p><p>Though Robert, who Lyanna afraid would hurt her child, is now gone. So who is this past plead about now? The Starks? Maybe. Or perhaps, another Targaryen who might see Jon as a threat. </p><p>Lyanna\u2019s line is also interesting, because her pleading is connected to Jon being taken in by Ned and Ned claiming him as his son, which caused a rift in Ned\u2019s marriage and in the Stark family. </p><p>Finally, I think both Lyanna and Ned are indicators of who Jon will choose in the end. Jon is a Stark through Lyanna, but also chooses to be a Stark through the father he chooses. </p><p>This is further emphasized by the statue of Jon in the end. As in the books, the statues are really only reserved for the former Kings and Lords of Winterfell, but will get to that in a bit.</p><p>Jon\u2019s parentage reveal will have a big impact on Jon, as it should. </p><p>A big portion of Jon\u2019s identity is constructed around him thinking Ned is his father and he himself is a bastard. Learning that he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s son is going to shake Jon\u2019s world, no matter what, but also learning that he is a Targaryen and has a claim to the Iron Throne is a whole other thing on top of that. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ce38cf4d47891c56c1a7758556420b2/tumblr_inline_pnliv8hX8G1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\"/></figure><p>Before Jon\u2019s first walk ends, he looks back and pauses, almost as though he heard the feather fall, only to turn back to continue forward.<br/></p><p>This could be interpreted as many different things, but for me it really comes down to Jon \u201chearing\u201d Lyanna. Everyone is so focused on Rhaegar being Jon\u2019s father, that they forget Lyanna is the mother Jon never knew he had and has wanted from the very beginning.</p><p>I think there will be a moment where Jon is in front of Lyanna\u2019s statue, perhaps finding a connection to a woman he never noticed all the times he was in the Crypts of Winterfell as a child. Always so focus on the Old Kings of Winterfell and how he would never be one. </p><p>Jon turning back to continue walking leads into Sansa\u2019s walk beginning \u2013 at first this makes it seem as though she is just following him down the same corridor, but she is not.</p><p>But nonetheless, the feather falling ends Jon\u2019s walk and begins Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6005e8cebeee20f974853bb3c7bbf74d/tumblr_inline_pnlittzooe1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\"/></figure><p><b>Sansa\u2019s Solo Walk is 6/7 seconds long</b><br/></p><p>Her walk is less \u201cdynamic\u201d than Jon\u2019s, less overall shots and plot info being laid out, but she looks back onto her mother\u2019s statue as we begin to hear Catelyn\u2019s voice and the beginning of her quote &ndash;</p><p>\u201cAll this horror that has come to my family\u2026\u201d</p><p>Catelyn\u2019s full quote is about how all the tragedies that have fallen upon the Starks was because she couldn\u2019t love Jon. </p><p>What has happened to the Starks has nothing to do with the fact that Catelyn ostracized Jon, but it is still an important character moment for Catelyn and one of the few lines she has about Jon. </p><p>It also puts a certain idea into the audience\u2019s head \u2013</p><p>The salvation for the Stark family, the future where they won\u2019t be the victims of countless tragedies, is contingent on them embracing and loving Jon.</p><p>However, unlike Cat, who couldn\u2019t love Jon because she thought he was Ned\u2019s son, the Stark children (Arya and Sansa), might have the opposite problem. </p><p>Finding it difficult to accept Jon when they find out \u201che\u2019s not one of them.\u201d Though that might be more Arya and less Sansa, but will get into that in a bit. </p><p>I would like to point out that both this teaser and the Tapestry one, bring to the forefront the pain Catelyn felt for Ned bringing Jon home and the rift it caused in their relationship.</p><p>You could easily bring up Jon\u2019s parentage without that aspect, so it\u2019s interesting that idea keeps being mentioned. But back to the walk -</p><p>Jon\u2019s walk ends with him looking back as the feather (Lyanna) fell to the ground.</p><p>Sansa in the show has been associated with both the feather and Lyanna\u2019s statue as well as sporting if not the same hairstyle in the promo, one very similar to Lyanna\u2019s when she was married to Rhaegar. Possibly indicating a bridal future for Sansa, but also -</p><p>That Jon\u2019s connection to the Starks are through his mother and Sansa (possibly his future wife).</p><p>Overall the emphasis on the feather is quite interesting.</p><p>Though it makes sense, since it\u2019s the only iconic item to Lyanna Stark within the active narrative of show, the blue rose is hinted at in the promos, backgrounds, and extra featurettes of the show, but it\u2019s not as prevalent in the show as it is in the books.</p><p>When I first watched the promo, I really thought Sansa was going to pick the feather up from the ground \u2013</p><p>Showing the connection between Lyanna, Jon, and Sansa, as while as telling us that Sansa will carry on Lyanna\u2019s dying wish of protecting Jon. And connecting aunt and niece as connections for Jon to his Stark family.</p><p>The first part of Catelyn\u2019s quote is the end of Sansa\u2019s walk, but the second part is the beginning of Arya\u2019s quote.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96a2a70d2885010f5da8e0a6f8e4946e/tumblr_inline_pnliwt84Mn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\"/></figure><p><b>Arya\u2019s Solo Walk is about 4 seconds \u2013</b><br/></p><p>Arya\u2019s walk is shorter than both Jon and Sansa\u2019s and she doesn\u2019t look at any statues (past figures).

And Arya has grown a strong sense of place with her identity as a Stark and seeking revenge for those who\u2019ve wrong the Starks in the past.</p><p>She slaughtered the Freys for the Starks and was more than willing to behead the Northern Lords in order to protect Jon.</p><p>While that last one might indicate Arya would never \u201cturn\u201d on Jon, it also shows that Arya\u2019s loyalty might not be exactly to who Jon is now, but to her memory of him. To her family.</p><p>If she feels he doesn\u2019t have the same loyalty, then\u2026.</p><p>Arya is also not exactly the most open person anymore, nor understanding \u2013 especially when it comes to political games or shows.</p><p>Sansa might be willing to give Dany Winterfell or at least be willing to say as much and bear and grin it, but Arya might have a harder time swallowing her tongue. </p><p>While Jon and Sansa take after who Ned really was, someone who was quite capable of deceiving those he loved and doing dishonorable things for a greater purpose. Arya (and Robb) seem to take after the image of who their father was, the honorable man who never strayed from the path of what he believed was right (though Arya is a much darker and twisted take on that idea)</p><p>And Arya also has gained some of Catelyn\u2019s less than admirable traits, so&hellip;</p><p>Plus, Catelyn\u2019s struggle was that she couldn\u2019t love Jon, because she believed he was Ned\u2019s bastard. So, it would be interesting that Arya might struggle with her relationship with Jon, because he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s bastard.</p><p>Perhaps not that literally, but &ndash;</p><p>Arya and Jon always got along, as the two outsider children and Arya found comfort in Jon being different in how she thought she was different (though arguably young Arya was likely projecting onto Jon).</p><p>But Jon being revealed to not being her brother and him possibly playing the political game and showing more loyalty to Dany, even just for show, might not go over well with Arya.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying Arya is going to hurt Jon, but there might be some tense moments. Especially since\u2026</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion has been built up so much by the fans and the characters within the show as being this wonderful and sweet reunion to happen - so there being tension between these two wouldn\u2019t surprise me.</p><p>But while I think this might a struggle for Arya and the seed for some tense moments, Arya will protect her family, no matter what. </p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d120a1f92dd3f8446b08e509da913c12/tumblr_inline_pnlj0blZIB1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\"/></figure><p><br/>The Statues in the crypt are great in my opinion. Doing the wonderful surface-level job of hinting at their deaths (like many of the season promos have done). Especially since, Jon and Sansa, walked past fallen characters who now have their own statues.<br/></p><p>Perhaps this is telling us these three will die in the upcoming battle, or perhaps the statues are telling us who will be remembered in history. </p><p>You can\u2019t have a legacy until your dead (and you will die in the end).</p><p>Jon, Sansa and Arya will be remembered. The Statues to me don\u2019t really signify their upcoming deaths, but that they are immortalized by their actions and the present for future generations.\u00a0</p><p>Bran being absent is very telling. Showing us what role, he might play in this story.</p><p>Bran and his story are strongly tied to magic and the Night King, his own absence from the trailer and his lack of statue, indicates that while he might be integral to defeating the Others (him, not dragons), he won\u2019t have a role to play afterwards.</p><p>He might not be remembered as an important figure in history or at least not in the political history. While Jon, Sansa and Arya will be remembered just as Arya remembered Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys.</p><p>Its also possible, Bran might get his own promo highlighting his importance to the story, but separating him from the Stark narrative.</p><p>Basically, I believe, the statues are telling us who will be important in the history books. Those three will be the ones who future generations remember when they\u2019re playing with each other as kids and who the future songs will be about.</p><p><b>The Torches Going Out</b></p><p>This is far from new. The candles, torches or fireplaces going out representing the Others and Winter coming has been a stable to GOT promos, since pretty much the beginning. But it\u2019s also starting to take on a different meaning, or not different, but clearer.</p><p>Fire may destroy the wights, but we\u2019ve seen within the show itself that even dragon fire is nothing to the Night King. Fire (the dragons) aren\u2019t effective when it comes to White Walkers.</p><p>Actually, and this is random, but when I saw this and when I was thinking about it, I thought of the matching phone game \u2013 Empires &amp; Puzzles. In the game,</p><p>Fire is effective against Nature and Nature is effective Ice and Ice is effective against Fire.</p><p>Fire (dragons) can destroy the Weirwood Trees (Winterfell)</p><p>The Weirwood Trees (Bran) can destroy the White Walkers</p><p>The White Walkers can destroy the Dragons</p><p>Similar to the Tapestry Promo, this may be less of a war between two opposing force, but three forces.</p><p>Either way I think promo worked really well and I\u2019m excited to seeing the Starks once more (which is the true goal of a promo). Sorry for the messy writing and analysis.\u00a0</p>",

They can\u2019t find amongst themselves, when they have Jon to protect.</p><p>But yet, the promo doesn\u2019t end indicating that Sansa and Arya will protect Jon. But instead, that Jon and Arya will protect Sansa.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1554\" data-orig-height=\"840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d74e2f21aa68cdaf6458840e618897da/tumblr_inline_pnliq3z7Eo1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1554\" data-orig-height=\"840\"></figure><p><br>The idea of Sansa potentially being kidnapped is a possibility and Arya and Jon drawing their swords to protect her, could be hinting at this. But this moment could also just be showing that Sansa is more vulnerable to outside threats, but nonetheless is protected by the Stark family.<br></p><p>The two Starks that might be viewed by outsiders as \u201cwild-cards,\u201d the King who bent the knee and the girl who grew up to be a \u201cFaceless assassin,\u201d have no hesitation in standing against the upcoming threat and protecting their own.</p><p>The Starks are a unit or pack. </p><p>Also, while I\u2019ve brought it up, it is important to note that Jon was in the center, but moved to Sansa\u2019s side. This might be a stretch, but this might indicate that Jon is not the key to get the Stark Alliance.</p><p>Daenerys and her camp (as well as Cersei) both focused on Jon being the key to getting the North (which makes sense, he was the King). But Jon moving to the side, putting Sansa center and front, shows the audience who the central figure to the Stark Family is.</p><p>Which leads into the idea, that Sansa is central to the Starks\u2019 Future.</p><p>Multiple times she has been referred to as the Key to the North and has been viewed as the legitimate heir to Winterfell. And both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton (and Littlefinger) believed whoever sired a child with Sansa, would be in control of Winterfell as that child would be the future Lord.</p><p>So, Sansa is definitely a key to the future of House Starks in several ways.</p><p>The real interesting thing though, is this promo isn\u2019t about Sansa or even House Stark as a whole.</p><p>It\u2019s all about Jon.</p><p>All the lines pertain to him and it\u2019s about who he really is and his story, and yet Sansa still gets a lot of attention. More so than Arya, as the time between them isn\u2019t split evenly. Hinting that Sansa plays an important part to who Jon currently is, but also where his story and future are going.</p><p>And I know I keep repeating this, but it\u2019s odd to make Sansa the central character in the end \u2013 as</p><p>A. The Promo isn\u2019t about her<br>B. Jon is a more central character to the story</p><p>But really a main idea that I think some people are overlooking, is that Jon is heavily connected to the Starks and their present and future. He is an integral part to the Stark Pack. </p><hr><p><b> The Intro Walks of Jon, Sansa and Arya.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"425\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34ad74068ea5014aa491ec6d81da8b55/tumblr_inline_pnlisdQenn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"425\"></figure><p><b>Jon\u2019s 1<sup>st</sup> walk is 17/18 seconds long<br></b><b>Jon\u2019s 2<sup>nd</sup> walk is 9 seconds long\u00a0</b></p><p><b>26/27 seconds altogether</b></p><p>He gets the most time and two separate walks to boot.</p><p>This makes sense, as he is the focus of this promo and is one of the biggest focuses of the show\u2019s overall story. </p><p>Jon walks right past Lyanna\u2019s statue. This is a reflection of Jon always wanting to know who his mother was, but was blind (lied to) about the truth. He walks right past the truth and his real mother and later pauses and stares directly at the man (Ned) he based so much on who he is now. </p><p>It is telling that Lyanna\u2019s line is spoken before Ned\u2019s though. </p><p>Indicating, that Jon will learn of his true parentage, falter in his identity, only to be reminded (by Ned\u2019s line) that he\u2019s never been a Stark in name and yet, has always been a Stark in blood. \u00a0</p><p>When Ned\u2019s Line is spoken and Jon is looking at Ned\u2019s Statue, it really does come across that Ned is directly talking to Jon in that moment. While Sansa also looks at Catelyn\u2019s statue, it\u2019s different as we don\u2019t get the impression she can hear Catelyn\u2019s words.</p><p>Jon can hear Ned\u2019s words. </p><p>Also Lyanna\u2019s line, while I think is reminding us of who \u201cJon really is\u201d isn\u2019t the one where she told Ned that Jon was Aegon Targaryen, instead it\u2019s her begging Ned to protect Jon.</p><p>Though Robert, who Lyanna afraid would hurt her child, is now gone. So who is this past plead about now? The Starks? Maybe. Or perhaps, another Targaryen who might see Jon as a threat. </p><p>Lyanna\u2019s line is also interesting, because her pleading is connected to Jon being taken in by Ned and Ned claiming him as his son, which caused a rift in Ned\u2019s marriage and in the Stark family. </p><p>Finally, I think both Lyanna and Ned are indicators of who Jon will choose in the end. Jon is a Stark through Lyanna, but also chooses to be a Stark through the father he chooses. </p><p>This is further emphasized by the statue of Jon in the end. As in the books, the statues are really only reserved for the former Kings and Lords of Winterfell, but will get to that in a bit.</p><p>Jon\u2019s parentage reveal will have a big impact on Jon, as it should. </p><p>A big portion of Jon\u2019s identity is constructed around him thinking Ned is his father and he himself is a bastard. Learning that he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s son is going to shake Jon\u2019s world, no matter what, but also learning that he is a Targaryen and has a claim to the Iron Throne is a whole other thing on top of that. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ce38cf4d47891c56c1a7758556420b2/tumblr_inline_pnliv8hX8G1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\"></figure><p>Before Jon\u2019s first walk ends, he looks back and pauses, almost as though he heard the feather fall, only to turn back to continue forward.<br></p><p>This could be interpreted as many different things, but for me it really comes down to Jon \u201chearing\u201d Lyanna. Everyone is so focused on Rhaegar being Jon\u2019s father, that they forget Lyanna is the mother Jon never knew he had and has wanted from the very beginning.</p><p>I think there will be a moment where Jon is in front of Lyanna\u2019s statue, perhaps finding a connection to a woman he never noticed all the times he was in the Crypts of Winterfell as a child. Always so focus on the Old Kings of Winterfell and how he would never be one. </p><p>Jon turning back to continue walking leads into Sansa\u2019s walk beginning \u2013 at first this makes it seem as though she is just following him down the same corridor, but she is not.</p><p>But nonetheless, the feather falling ends Jon\u2019s walk and begins Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6005e8cebeee20f974853bb3c7bbf74d/tumblr_inline_pnlittzooe1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\"></figure><p><b>Sansa\u2019s Solo Walk is 6/7 seconds long</b><br></p><p>Her walk is less \u201cdynamic\u201d than Jon\u2019s, less overall shots and plot info being laid out, but she looks back onto her mother\u2019s statue as we begin to hear Catelyn\u2019s voice and the beginning of her quote \u2013</p><p>\u201cAll this horror that has come to my family\u2026\u201d</p><p>Catelyn\u2019s full quote is about how all the tragedies that have fallen upon the Starks was because she couldn\u2019t love Jon. </p><p>What has happened to the Starks has nothing to do with the fact that Catelyn ostracized Jon, but it is still an important character moment for Catelyn and one of the few lines she has about Jon. </p><p>It also puts a certain idea into the audience\u2019s head \u2013</p><p>The salvation for the Stark family, the future where they won\u2019t be the victims of countless tragedies, is contingent on them embracing and loving Jon.</p><p>However, unlike Cat, who couldn\u2019t love Jon because she thought he was Ned\u2019s son, the Stark children (Arya and Sansa), might have the opposite problem. </p><p>Finding it difficult to accept Jon when they find out \u201che\u2019s not one of them.\u201d Though that might be more Arya and less Sansa, but will get into that in a bit. </p><p>I would like to point out that both this teaser and the Tapestry one, bring to the forefront the pain Catelyn felt for Ned bringing Jon home and the rift it caused in their relationship.</p><p>You could easily bring up Jon\u2019s parentage without that aspect, so it\u2019s interesting that idea keeps being mentioned. But back to the walk -</p><p>Jon\u2019s walk ends with him looking back as the feather (Lyanna) fell to the ground.</p><p>Sansa in the show has been associated with both the feather and Lyanna\u2019s statue as well as sporting if not the same hairstyle in the promo, one very similar to Lyanna\u2019s when she was married to Rhaegar. Possibly indicating a bridal future for Sansa, but also -</p><p>That Jon\u2019s connection to the Starks are through his mother and Sansa (possibly his future wife).</p><p>Overall the emphasis on the feather is quite interesting.</p><p>Though it makes sense, since it\u2019s the only iconic item to Lyanna Stark within the active narrative of show, the blue rose is hinted at in the promos, backgrounds, and extra featurettes of the show, but it\u2019s not as prevalent in the show as it is in the books.</p><p>When I first watched the promo, I really thought Sansa was going to pick the feather up from the ground \u2013</p><p>Showing the connection between Lyanna, Jon, and Sansa, as while as telling us that Sansa will carry on Lyanna\u2019s dying wish of protecting Jon. And connecting aunt and niece as connections for Jon to his Stark family.</p><p>The first part of Catelyn\u2019s quote is the end of Sansa\u2019s walk, but the second part is the beginning of Arya\u2019s quote.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96a2a70d2885010f5da8e0a6f8e4946e/tumblr_inline_pnliwt84Mn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\"></figure><p><b>Arya\u2019s Solo Walk is about 4 seconds \u2013</b><br></p><p>Arya\u2019s walk is shorter than both Jon and Sansa\u2019s and she doesn\u2019t look at any statues (past figures).

And Arya has grown a strong sense of place with her identity as a Stark and seeking revenge for those who\u2019ve wrong the Starks in the past.</p><p>She slaughtered the Freys for the Starks and was more than willing to behead the Northern Lords in order to protect Jon.</p><p>While that last one might indicate Arya would never \u201cturn\u201d on Jon, it also shows that Arya\u2019s loyalty might not be exactly to who Jon is now, but to her memory of him. To her family.</p><p>If she feels he doesn\u2019t have the same loyalty, then\u2026.</p><p>Arya is also not exactly the most open person anymore, nor understanding \u2013 especially when it comes to political games or shows.</p><p>Sansa might be willing to give Dany Winterfell or at least be willing to say as much and bear and grin it, but Arya might have a harder time swallowing her tongue. </p><p>While Jon and Sansa take after who Ned really was, someone who was quite capable of deceiving those he loved and doing dishonorable things for a greater purpose. Arya (and Robb) seem to take after the image of who their father was, the honorable man who never strayed from the path of what he believed was right (though Arya is a much darker and twisted take on that idea)</p><p>And Arya also has gained some of Catelyn\u2019s less than admirable traits, so\u2026</p><p>Plus, Catelyn\u2019s struggle was that she couldn\u2019t love Jon, because she believed he was Ned\u2019s bastard. So, it would be interesting that Arya might struggle with her relationship with Jon, because he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s bastard.</p><p>Perhaps not that literally, but \u2013</p><p>Arya and Jon always got along, as the two outsider children and Arya found comfort in Jon being different in how she thought she was different (though arguably young Arya was likely projecting onto Jon).</p><p>But Jon being revealed to not being her brother and him possibly playing the political game and showing more loyalty to Dany, even just for show, might not go over well with Arya.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying Arya is going to hurt Jon, but there might be some tense moments. Especially since\u2026</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion has been built up so much by the fans and the characters within the show as being this wonderful and sweet reunion to happen - so there being tension between these two wouldn\u2019t surprise me.</p><p>But while I think this might a struggle for Arya and the seed for some tense moments, Arya will protect her family, no matter what. </p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d120a1f92dd3f8446b08e509da913c12/tumblr_inline_pnlj0blZIB1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\"></figure><p><br>The Statues in the crypt are great in my opinion.

The Statues to me don\u2019t really signify their upcoming deaths, but that they are immortalized by their actions and the present for future generations.\u00a0</p><p>Bran being absent is very telling. Showing us what role, he might play in this story.</p><p>Bran and his story are strongly tied to magic and the Night King, his own absence from the trailer and his lack of statue, indicates that while he might be integral to defeating the Others (him, not dragons), he won\u2019t have a role to play afterwards.</p><p>He might not be remembered as an important figure in history or at least not in the political history. While Jon, Sansa and Arya will be remembered just as Arya remembered Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys.</p><p>Its also possible, Bran might get his own promo highlighting his importance to the story, but separating him from the Stark narrative.</p><p>Basically, I believe, the statues are telling us who will be important in the history books. Those three will be the ones who future generations remember when they\u2019re playing with each other as kids and who the future songs will be about.</p><p><b>The Torches Going Out</b></p><p>This is far from new.

So sorry, if no one cares about this promo anymore.<br></p><p>I\u2019m going to be talking about what I think the Crypt promo is hinting or foreshadowing at. But first\u2026</p><p>It is very interesting Sansa is made to be in the center at the end, especially since Jon is at first in the center - standing between both Arya and Sansa as the three meet up. </p><p>But then as they walk to their statues, he moves around Sansa to be on her side, which puts her in the center. This is a 100% deliberate choice, they could\u2019ve easily had them all walk straight towards their own statues with no rearrangements.</p><p>They literally have Jon stay behind Arya and Sansa and then move around Sansa, so he wouldn\u2019t be in the center.</p><p>So why? </p><p>One reasoning, is that it might actually be to avoid certain Targaryen imagery \u2013 specifically Aegon the Conqueror who in official art (?) and fan art is often flanked on both sides by his two-sister-wives. </p><p>The second, I imagined Jon being in the center, flanked on either side by his sisters, my mind went to Aegon and his sister-wives\u2026 so perhaps, it\u2019s best to avoid that idea altogether.

This might be a stretch, but this might indicate that Jon is not the key to get the Stark Alliance.</p><p>Daenerys and her camp (as well as Cersei) both focused on Jon being the key to getting the North (which makes sense, he was the King). But Jon moving to the side, putting Sansa center and front, shows the audience who the central figure to the Stark Family is.</p><p>Which leads into the idea, that Sansa is central to the Starks\u2019 Future.</p><p>Multiple times she has been referred to as the Key to the North and has been viewed as the legitimate heir to Winterfell. And both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton (and Littlefinger) believed whoever sired a child with Sansa, would be in control of Winterfell as that child would be the future Lord.</p><p>So, Sansa is definitely a key to the future of House Starks in several ways.</p><p>The real interesting thing though, is this promo isn\u2019t about Sansa or even House Stark as a whole.</p><p>It\u2019s all about Jon.</p><p>All the lines pertain to him and it\u2019s about who he really is and his story, and yet Sansa still gets a lot of attention. More so than Arya, as the time between them isn\u2019t split evenly. Hinting that Sansa plays an important part to who Jon currently is, but also where his story and future are going.</p><p>And I know I keep repeating this, but it\u2019s odd to make Sansa the central character in the end \u2013 as</p><p>A. The Promo isn\u2019t about her<br>B. Jon is a more central character to the story</p><p>But really a main idea that I think some people are overlooking, is that Jon is heavily connected to the Starks and their present and future.

This is a reflection of Jon always wanting to know who his mother was, but was blind (lied to) about the truth. He walks right past the truth and his real mother and later pauses and stares directly at the man (Ned) he based so much on who he is now. </p><p>It is telling that Lyanna\u2019s line is spoken before Ned\u2019s though. </p><p>Indicating, that Jon will learn of his true parentage, falter in his identity, only to be reminded (by Ned\u2019s line) that he\u2019s never been a Stark in name and yet, has always been a Stark in blood. \u00a0</p><p>When Ned\u2019s Line is spoken and Jon is looking at Ned\u2019s Statue, it really does come across that Ned is directly talking to Jon in that moment. While Sansa also looks at Catelyn\u2019s statue, it\u2019s different as we don\u2019t get the impression she can hear Catelyn\u2019s words.</p><p>Jon can hear Ned\u2019s words. </p><p>Also Lyanna\u2019s line, while I think is reminding us of who \u201cJon really is\u201d isn\u2019t the one where she told Ned that Jon was Aegon Targaryen, instead it\u2019s her begging Ned to protect Jon.</p><p>Though Robert, who Lyanna afraid would hurt her child, is now gone. So who is this past plead about now? The Starks? Maybe. Or perhaps, another Targaryen who might see Jon as a threat. </p><p>Lyanna\u2019s line is also interesting, because her pleading is connected to Jon being taken in by Ned and Ned claiming him as his son, which caused a rift in Ned\u2019s marriage and in the Stark family. </p><p>Finally, I think both Lyanna and Ned are indicators of who Jon will choose in the end. Jon is a Stark through Lyanna, but also chooses to be a Stark through the father he chooses. </p><p>This is further emphasized by the statue of Jon in the end. As in the books, the statues are really only reserved for the former Kings and Lords of Winterfell, but will get to that in a bit.</p><p>Jon\u2019s parentage reveal will have a big impact on Jon, as it should. </p><p>A big portion of Jon\u2019s identity is constructed around him thinking Ned is his father and he himself is a bastard. Learning that he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s son is going to shake Jon\u2019s world, no matter what, but also learning that he is a Targaryen and has a claim to the Iron Throne is a whole other thing on top of that. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ce38cf4d47891c56c1a7758556420b2/tumblr_inline_pnliv8hX8G1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1153\" data-orig-height=\"615\"></figure><p>Before Jon\u2019s first walk ends, he looks back and pauses, almost as though he heard the feather fall, only to turn back to continue forward.<br></p><p>This could be interpreted as many different things, but for me it really comes down to Jon \u201chearing\u201d Lyanna. Everyone is so focused on Rhaegar being Jon\u2019s father, that they forget Lyanna is the mother Jon never knew he had and has wanted from the very beginning.</p><p>I think there will be a moment where Jon is in front of Lyanna\u2019s statue, perhaps finding a connection to a woman he never noticed all the times he was in the Crypts of Winterfell as a child. Always so focus on the Old Kings of Winterfell and how he would never be one. </p><p>Jon turning back to continue walking leads into Sansa\u2019s walk beginning \u2013 at first this makes it seem as though she is just following him down the same corridor, but she is not.</p><p>But nonetheless, the feather falling ends Jon\u2019s walk and begins Sansa\u2019s.\u00a0</p><figure data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6005e8cebeee20f974853bb3c7bbf74d/tumblr_inline_pnlittzooe1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"590\" data-orig-height=\"350\"></figure><p><b>Sansa\u2019s Solo Walk is 6/7 seconds long</b><br></p><p>Her walk is less \u201cdynamic\u201d than Jon\u2019s, less overall shots and plot info being laid out, but she looks back onto her mother\u2019s statue as we begin to hear Catelyn\u2019s voice and the beginning of her quote \u2013</p><p>\u201cAll this horror that has come to my family\u2026\u201d</p><p>Catelyn\u2019s full quote is about how all the tragedies that have fallen upon the Starks was because she couldn\u2019t love Jon. </p><p>What has happened to the Starks has nothing to do with the fact that Catelyn ostracized Jon, but it is still an important character moment for Catelyn and one of the few lines she has about Jon. </p><p>It also puts a certain idea into the audience\u2019s head \u2013</p><p>The salvation for the Stark family, the future where they won\u2019t be the victims of countless tragedies, is contingent on them embracing and loving Jon.</p><p>However, unlike Cat, who couldn\u2019t love Jon because she thought he was Ned\u2019s son, the Stark children (Arya and Sansa), might have the opposite problem. </p><p>Finding it difficult to accept Jon when they find out \u201che\u2019s not one of them.\u201d Though that might be more Arya and less Sansa, but will get into that in a bit. </p><p>I would like to point out that both this teaser and the Tapestry one, bring to the forefront the pain Catelyn felt for Ned bringing Jon home and the rift it caused in their relationship.</p><p>You could easily bring up Jon\u2019s parentage without that aspect, so it\u2019s interesting that idea keeps being mentioned. But back to the walk -</p><p>Jon\u2019s walk ends with him looking back as the feather (Lyanna) fell to the ground.</p><p>Sansa in the show has been associated with both the feather and Lyanna\u2019s statue as well as sporting if not the same hairstyle in the promo, one very similar to Lyanna\u2019s when she was married to Rhaegar. Possibly indicating a bridal future for Sansa, but also -</p><p>That Jon\u2019s connection to the Starks are through his mother and Sansa (possibly his future wife).</p><p>Overall the emphasis on the feather is quite interesting.</p><p>Though it makes sense, since it\u2019s the only iconic item to Lyanna Stark within the active narrative of show, the blue rose is hinted at in the promos, backgrounds, and extra featurettes of the show, but it\u2019s not as prevalent in the show as it is in the books.</p><p>When I first watched the promo, I really thought Sansa was going to pick the feather up from the ground \u2013</p><p>Showing the connection between Lyanna, Jon, and Sansa, as while as telling us that Sansa will carry on Lyanna\u2019s dying wish of protecting Jon. And connecting aunt and niece as connections for Jon to his Stark family.</p><p>The first part of Catelyn\u2019s quote is the end of Sansa\u2019s walk, but the second part is the beginning of Arya\u2019s quote.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96a2a70d2885010f5da8e0a6f8e4946e/tumblr_inline_pnliwt84Mn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2276\" data-orig-height=\"1242\"></figure><p><b>Arya\u2019s Solo Walk is about 4 seconds \u2013</b><br></p><p>Arya\u2019s walk is shorter than both Jon and Sansa\u2019s and she doesn\u2019t look at any statues (past figures).

And Arya has grown a strong sense of place with her identity as a Stark and seeking revenge for those who\u2019ve wrong the Starks in the past.</p><p>She slaughtered the Freys for the Starks and was more than willing to behead the Northern Lords in order to protect Jon.</p><p>While that last one might indicate Arya would never \u201cturn\u201d on Jon, it also shows that Arya\u2019s loyalty might not be exactly to who Jon is now, but to her memory of him. To her family.</p><p>If she feels he doesn\u2019t have the same loyalty, then\u2026.</p><p>Arya is also not exactly the most open person anymore, nor understanding \u2013 especially when it comes to political games or shows.</p><p>Sansa might be willing to give Dany Winterfell or at least be willing to say as much and bear and grin it, but Arya might have a harder time swallowing her tongue. </p><p>While Jon and Sansa take after who Ned really was, someone who was quite capable of deceiving those he loved and doing dishonorable things for a greater purpose. Arya (and Robb) seem to take after the image of who their father was, the honorable man who never strayed from the path of what he believed was right (though Arya is a much darker and twisted take on that idea)</p><p>And Arya also has gained some of Catelyn\u2019s less than admirable traits, so\u2026</p><p>Plus, Catelyn\u2019s struggle was that she couldn\u2019t love Jon, because she believed he was Ned\u2019s bastard. So, it would be interesting that Arya might struggle with her relationship with Jon, because he\u2019s not Ned\u2019s bastard.</p><p>Perhaps not that literally, but \u2013</p><p>Arya and Jon always got along, as the two outsider children and Arya found comfort in Jon being different in how she thought she was different (though arguably young Arya was likely projecting onto Jon).</p><p>But Jon being revealed to not being her brother and him possibly playing the political game and showing more loyalty to Dany, even just for show, might not go over well with Arya.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying Arya is going to hurt Jon, but there might be some tense moments. Especially since\u2026</p><p>Jon and Arya\u2019s reunion has been built up so much by the fans and the characters within the show as being this wonderful and sweet reunion to happen - so there being tension between these two wouldn\u2019t surprise me.</p><p>But while I think this might a struggle for Arya and the seed for some tense moments, Arya will protect her family, no matter what. </p><hr><figure data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d120a1f92dd3f8446b08e509da913c12/tumblr_inline_pnlj0blZIB1qg9ixw_1280.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"644\" data-orig-height=\"410\"></figure><p><br>The Statues in the crypt are great in my opinion.

Showing us what role, he might play in this story.</p><p>Bran and his story are strongly tied to magic and the Night King, his own absence from the trailer and his lack of statue, indicates that while he might be integral to defeating the Others (him, not dragons), he won\u2019t have a role to play afterwards.</p><p>He might not be remembered as an important figure in history or at least not in the political history.

And both Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton (and Littlefinger) believed whoever sired a child with Sansa, would be in control of Winterfell as that child would be the future Lord.</p><p>So, Sansa is definitely a key to the future of House Starks in several ways.</p><p>The real interesting thing though, is this promo isn&rsquo;t about Sansa or even House Stark as a whole.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all about Jon.</p><p>All the lines pertain to him and it&rsquo;s about who he really is and his story, and yet Sansa still gets a lot of attention. More so than Arya, as the time between them isn&rsquo;t split evenly. Hinting that Sansa plays an important part to who Jon currently is, but also where his story and future are going.</p><p>And I know I keep repeating this, but it&rsquo;s odd to make Sansa the central character in the end &ndash; as</p><p>A. The Promo isn&rsquo;t about her<br />B. Jon is a more central character to the story</p><p>But really a main idea that I think some people are overlooking, is that Jon is heavily connected to the Starks and their present and future. He is an integral part to the Stark Pack. </p><hr /><p><b> The Intro Walks of Jon, Sansa and Arya.</b></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34ad74068ea5014aa491ec6d81da8b55/tumblr_inline_pnlisdQenn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Jon&rsquo;s 1<sup>st</sup> walk is 17/18 seconds long<br /></b><b>Jon&rsquo;s 2<sup>nd</sup> walk is 9 seconds long&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>26/27 seconds altogether</b></p><p>He gets the most time and two separate walks to boot.</p><p>This makes sense, as he is the focus of this promo and is one of the biggest focuses of the show&rsquo;s overall story. </p><p>Jon walks right past Lyanna&rsquo;s statue. This is a reflection of Jon always wanting to know who his mother was, but was blind (lied to) about the truth. He walks right past the truth and his real mother and later pauses and stares directly at the man (Ned) he based so much on who he is now. </p><p>It is telling that Lyanna&rsquo;s line is spoken before Ned&rsquo;s though. </p><p>Indicating, that Jon will learn of his true parentage, falter in his identity, only to be reminded (by Ned&rsquo;s line) that he&rsquo;s never been a Stark in name and yet, has always been a Stark in blood. &nbsp;</p><p>When Ned&rsquo;s Line is spoken and Jon is looking at Ned&rsquo;s Statue, it really does come across that Ned is directly talking to Jon in that moment. While Sansa also looks at Catelyn&rsquo;s statue, it&rsquo;s different as we don&rsquo;t get the impression she can hear Catelyn&rsquo;s words.</p><p>Jon can hear Ned&rsquo;s words. </p><p>Also Lyanna&rsquo;s line, while I think is reminding us of who &ldquo;Jon really is&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the one where she told Ned that Jon was Aegon Targaryen, instead it&rsquo;s her begging Ned to protect Jon.</p><p>Though Robert, who Lyanna afraid would hurt her child, is now gone. So who is this past plead about now? The Starks? Maybe. Or perhaps, another Targaryen who might see Jon as a threat. </p><p>Lyanna&rsquo;s line is also interesting, because her pleading is connected to Jon being taken in by Ned and Ned claiming him as his son, which caused a rift in Ned&rsquo;s marriage and in the Stark family. </p><p>Finally, I think both Lyanna and Ned are indicators of who Jon will choose in the end. Jon is a Stark through Lyanna, but also chooses to be a Stark through the father he chooses. </p><p>This is further emphasized by the statue of Jon in the end. As in the books, the statues are really only reserved for the former Kings and Lords of Winterfell, but will get to that in a bit.</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s parentage reveal will have a big impact on Jon, as it should. </p><p>A big portion of Jon&rsquo;s identity is constructed around him thinking Ned is his father and he himself is a bastard. Learning that he&rsquo;s not Ned&rsquo;s son is going to shake Jon&rsquo;s world, no matter what, but also learning that he is a Targaryen and has a claim to the Iron Throne is a whole other thing on top of that. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ce38cf4d47891c56c1a7758556420b2/tumblr_inline_pnliv8hX8G1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Before Jon&rsquo;s first walk ends, he looks back and pauses, almost as though he heard the feather fall, only to turn back to continue forward.<br /></p><p>This could be interpreted as many different things, but for me it really comes down to Jon &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; Lyanna. Everyone is so focused on Rhaegar being Jon&rsquo;s father, that they forget Lyanna is the mother Jon never knew he had and has wanted from the very beginning.</p><p>I think there will be a moment where Jon is in front of Lyanna&rsquo;s statue, perhaps finding a connection to a woman he never noticed all the times he was in the Crypts of Winterfell as a child. Always so focus on the Old Kings of Winterfell and how he would never be one. </p><p>Jon turning back to continue walking leads into Sansa&rsquo;s walk beginning &ndash; at first this makes it seem as though she is just following him down the same corridor, but she is not.</p><p>But nonetheless, the feather falling ends Jon&rsquo;s walk and begins Sansa&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6005e8cebeee20f974853bb3c7bbf74d/tumblr_inline_pnlittzooe1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Sansa&rsquo;s Solo Walk is 6/7 seconds long</b><br /></p><p>Her walk is less &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; than Jon&rsquo;s, less overall shots and plot info being laid out, but she looks back onto her mother&rsquo;s statue as we begin to hear Catelyn&rsquo;s voice and the beginning of her quote &ndash;</p><p>&ldquo;All this horror that has come to my family&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn&rsquo;s full quote is about how all the tragedies that have fallen upon the Starks was because she couldn&rsquo;t love Jon. </p><p>What has happened to the Starks has nothing to do with the fact that Catelyn ostracized Jon, but it is still an important character moment for Catelyn and one of the few lines she has about Jon. </p><p>It also puts a certain idea into the audience&rsquo;s head &ndash;</p><p>The salvation for the Stark family, the future where they won&rsquo;t be the victims of countless tragedies, is contingent on them embracing and loving Jon.</p><p>However, unlike Cat, who couldn&rsquo;t love Jon because she thought he was Ned&rsquo;s son, the Stark children (Arya and Sansa), might have the opposite problem. </p><p>Finding it difficult to accept Jon when they find out &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not one of them.&rdquo; Though that might be more Arya and less Sansa, but will get into that in a bit. </p><p>I would like to point out that both this teaser and the Tapestry one, bring to the forefront the pain Catelyn felt for Ned bringing Jon home and the rift it caused in their relationship.</p><p>You could easily bring up Jon&rsquo;s parentage without that aspect, so it&rsquo;s interesting that idea keeps being mentioned. But back to the walk -</p><p>Jon&rsquo;s walk ends with him looking back as the feather (Lyanna) fell to the ground.</p><p>Sansa in the show has been associated with both the feather and Lyanna&rsquo;s statue as well as sporting if not the same hairstyle in the promo, one very similar to Lyanna&rsquo;s when she was married to Rhaegar. Possibly indicating a bridal future for Sansa, but also -</p><p>That Jon&rsquo;s connection to the Starks are through his mother and Sansa (possibly his future wife).</p><p>Overall the emphasis on the feather is quite interesting.</p><p>Though it makes sense, since it&rsquo;s the only iconic item to Lyanna Stark within the active narrative of show, the blue rose is hinted at in the promos, backgrounds, and extra featurettes of the show, but it&rsquo;s not as prevalent in the show as it is in the books.</p><p>When I first watched the promo, I really thought Sansa was going to pick the feather up from the ground &ndash;</p><p>Showing the connection between Lyanna, Jon, and Sansa, as while as telling us that Sansa will carry on Lyanna&rsquo;s dying wish of protecting Jon. And connecting aunt and niece as connections for Jon to his Stark family.</p><p>The first part of Catelyn&rsquo;s quote is the end of Sansa&rsquo;s walk, but the second part is the beginning of Arya&rsquo;s quote.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96a2a70d2885010f5da8e0a6f8e4946e/tumblr_inline_pnliwt84Mn1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><b>Arya&rsquo;s Solo Walk is about 4 seconds &ndash;</b><br /></p><p>Arya&rsquo;s walk is shorter than both Jon and Sansa&rsquo;s and she doesn&rsquo;t look at any statues (past figures). So, you might think there&rsquo;s less to discuss.</p><p>However, the second part of Catelyn&rsquo;s voiceover is over Arya&rsquo;s walk.</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s all because I couldn&rsquo;t love a motherless child.&rdquo;</p><p>Catelyn line being over both Arya and Sansa, connects the two sisters to not only Catelyn, but also Jon and put forth the challenge of them being better than their mother in how they treat him.</p><p>However, the part of how Catelyn couldn&rsquo;t love Jon, could be hinting at a future struggle for Arya.</p><p>Arya has certainly changed from the girl she used to be.</p><p>In many ways, her world view has become more than a bit severe. And Arya has grown a strong sense of place with her identity as a Stark and seeking revenge for those who&rsquo;ve wrong the Starks in the past.</p><p>She slaughtered the Freys for the Starks and was more than willing to behead the Northern Lords in order to protect Jon.</p><p>While that last one might indicate Arya would never &ldquo;turn&rdquo; on Jon, it also shows that Arya&rsquo;s loyalty might not be exactly to who Jon is now, but to her memory of him. To her family.</p><p>If she feels he doesn&rsquo;t have the same loyalty, then&hellip;.</p><p>Arya is also not exactly the most open person anymore, nor understanding &ndash; especially when it comes to political games or shows.</p><p>Sansa might be willing to give Dany Winterfell or at least be willing to say as much and bear and grin it, but Arya might have a harder time swallowing her tongue. </p><p>While Jon and Sansa take after who Ned really was, someone who was quite capable of deceiving those he loved and doing dishonorable things for a greater purpose. Arya (and Robb) seem to take after the image of who their father was, the honorable man who never strayed from the path of what he believed was right (though Arya is a much darker and twisted take on that idea)</p><p>And Arya also has gained some of Catelyn&rsquo;s less than admirable traits, so&hellip;</p><p>Plus, Catelyn&rsquo;s struggle was that she couldn&rsquo;t love Jon, because she believed he was Ned&rsquo;s bastard. So, it would be interesting that Arya might struggle with her relationship with Jon, because he&rsquo;s not Ned&rsquo;s bastard.</p><p>Perhaps not that literally, but &ndash;</p><p>Arya and Jon always got along, as the two outsider children and Arya found comfort in Jon being different in how she thought she was different (though arguably young Arya was likely projecting onto Jon).</p><p>But Jon being revealed to not being her brother and him possibly playing the political game and showing more loyalty to Dany, even just for show, might not go over well with Arya.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying Arya is going to hurt Jon, but there might be some tense moments. Especially since&hellip;</p><p>Jon and Arya&rsquo;s reunion has been built up so much by the fans and the characters within the show as being this wonderful and sweet reunion to happen - so there being tension between these two wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me.</p><p>But while I think this might a struggle for Arya and the seed for some tense moments, Arya will protect her family, no matter what. </p><hr /><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d120a1f92dd3f8446b08e509da913c12/tumblr_inline_pnlj0blZIB1qg9ixw_1280.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><br />The Statues in the crypt are great in my opinion. Doing the wonderful surface-level job of hinting at their deaths (like many of the season promos have done). Especially since, Jon and Sansa, walked past fallen characters who now have their own statues.<br /></p><p>Perhaps this is telling us these three will die in the upcoming battle, or perhaps the statues are telling us who will be remembered in history. </p><p>You can&rsquo;t have a legacy until your dead (and you will die in the end).</p><p>Jon, Sansa and Arya will be remembered. The Statues to me don&rsquo;t really signify their upcoming deaths, but that they are immortalized by their actions and the present for future generations.&nbsp;</p><p>Bran being absent is very telling. Showing us what role, he might play in this story.</p><p>Bran and his story are strongly tied to magic and the Night King, his own absence from the trailer and his lack of statue, indicates that while he might be integral to defeating the Others (him, not dragons), he won&rsquo;t have a role to play afterwards.</p><p>He might not be remembered as an important figure in history or at least not in the political history. While Jon, Sansa and Arya will be remembered just as Arya remembered Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys.</p><p>Its also possible, Bran might get his own promo highlighting his importance to the story, but separating him from the Stark narrative.</p><p>Basically, I believe, the statues are telling us who will be important in the history books. Those three will be the ones who future generations remember when they&rsquo;re playing with each other as kids and who the future songs will be about.</p><p><b>The Torches Going Out</b></p><p>This is far from new. The candles, torches or fireplaces going out representing the Others and Winter coming has been a stable to GOT promos, since pretty much the beginning. But it&rsquo;s also starting to take on a different meaning, or not different, but clearer.</p><p>Fire may destroy the wights, but we&rsquo;ve seen within the show itself that even dragon fire is nothing to the Night King. Fire (the dragons) aren&rsquo;t effective when it comes to White Walkers.</p><p>Actually, and this is random, but when I saw this and when I was thinking about it, I thought of the matching phone game &ndash; Empires &amp; Puzzles. In the game,</p><p>Fire is effective against Nature and Nature is effective Ice and Ice is effective against Fire.</p><p>Fire (dragons) can destroy the Weirwood Trees (Winterfell)</p><p>The Weirwood Trees (Bran) can destroy the White Walkers</p><p>The White Walkers can destroy the Dragons</p><p>Similar to the Tapestry Promo, this may be less of a war between two opposing force, but three forces.</p><p>Either way I think promo worked really well and I&rsquo;m excited to seeing the Starks once more (which is the true goal of a promo). Sorry for the messy writing and analysis.&nbsp;</p></p>",
                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\"><p><a href=\"#\"><img src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/images/inline_placeholder.png\" width=\"18\" height=\"14\"/></a></p></figure>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to talk about promo since I first saw it, but work has been overwhelming and I needed time to write my thoughts down. So sorry, if no one cares about this promo anymore.<br /></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to be talking about what I think the Crypt promo is hinting or foreshadowing at. But first&hellip;</p>\n<p>It is very interesting Sansa is made to be in the center at the end, especially since Jon is at first in the center - standing between both Arya and Sansa as the three meet up. </p>\n<p>But then as they walk to their statues, he moves around Sansa to be on her side, which puts her in the center. This is a 100% deliberate choice, they could&rsquo;ve easily had them all walk straight towards their own statues with no rearrangements.</p>\n<p>They literally have Jon stay behind Arya and Sansa and then move around Sansa, so he wouldn&rsquo;t be in the center.</p>\n<p>So why? </p>\n<p>One reasoning, is that it might actually be to avoid certain Targaryen imagery &ndash; specifically Aegon the Conqueror who in official art (?) and fan art is often flanked on both sides by his two-sister-wives. </p>\n<p>The second, I imagined Jon being in the center, flanked on either side by his sisters, my mind went to Aegon and his sister-wives&hellip; so perhaps, it&rsquo;s best to avoid that idea altogether. Especially if you don&rsquo;t want your audience to be weirded out by Jon and Sansa (if I think what is happening is happening).</p>\n<p>It could also be that visually Sansa is the tallest one, so it creates more of a symmetrical aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Especially, when both Jon and Arya draw their swords to face the upcoming danger.</p>\n<p>If Sansa was on the side as both Jon and Arya pull out their swords, that would&rsquo;ve sideline her from the action &ndash; keeping her in the center, keeps her in the scene.</p>\n<p>It could also just be to cement the idea that Sansa is a major player to this season and to the end of the story.</p>\n<p>Basically, from just a promo standpoint, it makes sense to put Sansa in the center, though this promo is all about Jon. Either just to avoid certain Targaryen visuals or to reinforce already existing ideas.</p>\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s go into some of the story/plot-driven reasons for this promo and its choices (foreshadowing).</p>\n<hr />\n</p>",

Arya had always found the phrase disgusting.</p><p>Now she understood it.</p><p>&ldquo;Arry.&rdquo; He said it so low she almost didn&rsquo;t hear it, as if\nhe hadn&rsquo;t realized he was speaking.</p><p>Time stood still. The constant movement in the courtyard\nceased. Everything that wasn&rsquo;t the two of them momentarily stopped existing.</p><p>He was dead. She had spent so long thinking he was dead. And\nyet, there he stood in mountain of furs, cheeks reddened by the howling wind.\nHe was older, taller, different in a thousand miniscule ways, but still\nhimself. He was more handsome, she realized. </p><p>Or maybe she was just less blind to it. </p><p>&ldquo;Welcome to Winterfell,&rdquo; she managed. He had made it to her\nhome, just as she&rsquo;d planned a lifetime ago. It didn&rsquo;t matter that it had taken\nso damn long, or that he had come to serve under the wrong brother, or that he was\nseeing her beloved home in such a sorry state. All that mattered was that he\nwas there, alive.</p><p>And the sight of him made her feel as though there were\nbutterflies in her stomach. </p><p>They both stood there in the middle of the courtyard, each\nof them too scared to move and break whatever spell hung in the air between\nthem.</p><p>It was Gendry who summoned his courage first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m\nlate, m&rsquo;lady.&rdquo;</p><p>The butterflies started beating their wings even faster and\na grin lit Arya&rsquo;s face up. &ldquo;Stupid Bull&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered before launching herself\nat him like a wolf pouncing on its prey. </p><p>She was grateful for the inordinate amount of clothing he\nwore when she realized that it was the only that had prevented her from\ncrashing headlong into a wall of solid muscle. <i>He&rsquo;s strong</i>, she remembered, wrapping her arms around him and\nburying her face in his chest. <i>Stronger\nthan before.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>They both were. </p><p>One of his arms held her tightly around the shoulders while\nhe stroked her hair with the other hand. She had a thousand questions for him\nbubbling up in her head, and she was sure he had even more, but for now all she\nwanted was this moment. She wanted to feel his hand in her hair and his strong\nchest against her cheek for just a second longer.</p><p>The real world would come crashing back to them in a moment,\nbut for now she wanted to enjoy the butterflies, lest they be the last ones she\never encountered in the realm of the living.</p>",
