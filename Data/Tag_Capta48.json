If you are still taking requests, can you do a continuation of Home where Brie kind of gets sad because of all the hate she is getting (she doesn\u2019t deserve it) and the reader comforts her together with the rest of the mcu cast especially Hemsworth and Cheadle. Thank you.</p><p>Anonymous:<b>\u00a0</b>i loved your Home one shot! can you do one where brie and her non famous girlfriend are hanging out at Disneyland with the other cast after she is done with press</p><p><b>Pairing: </b>Brie x reader</p><p><b>A/N:</b>\u00a0Wooow I\u2019m posting this much later than I meant to.

You groan slightly, snuggling closer to Brie. She pulls you in towards her, pressing a kiss to your neck before she leans over you and kisses you on the lips. You hum into the kiss and she pulls back, smiling softly at you.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she says with a slight rasp to her voice. You lift a hand to tuck a strand of her short hair behind her ear and out of her face.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, baby,\u201d you reply to her before reaching towards your phone. You glance at the time and then back at Brie. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up, I\u2019m supposed to be meeting some friends for breakfast.\u201d Brie immediately pouts.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat? No! Stay here and cuddle with me!\u201d You attempt to remove her arms from around you but she only tightens them. You huff and playfully glare at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie. I swear I\u2019ll be back so quickly you\u2019ll barely realise I\u2019ve gone. Then we can cuddle for as long as you want.\u201d Brie seems to contemplate your words for a moment before reluctantly releasing you from her hold.</p><p>\u201cFine. But you better be ready to cuddle me the second you get back.\u201d You chuckle at her and kiss the pout off her lips before getting out of bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>As promised, breakfast is only a quick outing and you\u2019re back at the house fairly quickly. You make your way to the bedroom where you assume Brie still is. Your confusion peaks, however, when you notice the curtains are drawn shut, the room shrouded in darkness. You can see Brie\u2019s figure sitting on the bed and her laptop in front of her shines some light onto her features.<br/></p><p>\u201cUhh. Babe, this is very ominous, don\u2019t you think?\u201d You startle Brie and immediately notice when she swipes at her face, clearly wiping away tears.</p><p>\u201cBrie?\u201d You automatically rush to her, placing yourself on the bed in front of her and resting your hands on her face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You wipe at the tears she missed and watch her closely, trying to focus on her eyes through the dark of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says weakly. You give her a disbelieving look.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine to me. What happened?\u201d You speak gently and she sighs as another tear rolls down her cheek. You wipe it away with your thumb and wait patiently before Brie grabs her laptop and shows you the screen.</p><p>She\u2019s got Youtube open, and she\u2019s searched her own name in the search bar. You look at some of the videos listed on the page. They range from \u2018How Brie Larson is ruining the MCU\u2019 to \u2018Proof that the Avengers cast hate Brie Larson\u2019. You sigh and look at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, what were even doing looking at this stuff? You know it\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d She shrugs weakly and you shut her laptop and put it aside.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were gone, I went on Twitter and saw all these guys posting about me and how Don and Chris clearly hate me.\u201d You place your hand on Brie\u2019s thigh to comfort her and she drops her hand onto of yours, tracing the back of your hand with her thumb. \u201cI mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I guess it just hit me hard today. Especially when I saw all the videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you should extend that stay away from social media then, hm?\u201d You say gently. Brie sadly hums in response and wraps you in a tight embrace.</p><p>Since the end of the press tour, Brie had been overwhelmed with the amount of attention she\u2019d received, both good and bad, and had decided on a much needed break from social media. You knew that as she\u2019d gotten more popular, she\u2019d had difficulty dealing with the attention because of her introverted nature, and she needed these breaks from time to time.</p><p>\u201cHey, how about we go out and do something today? We can forget all about the trolls of the internet for a little while.\u201d You kiss Brie on the cheek and she leans into your body more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Y/N. I\u2019m just really not in the mood today.\u201d She pulls away from your embrace and stands, rubbing her face with her hand before she smiles at you sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You stand up to join her, taking her hands in your own and holding them between you.</p><p>\u201cBrie, you have absolutely nothing to apologise for. You hear me?\u201d Your words are gentle and you see the smallest of smiles cross her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she nods. Her eyes hold a warmth for you as she holds your gaze. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna jump in the shower. Maybe it\u2019ll make me feel a little better.\u201d You nod at her and watch her walk into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>When you hear the shower turn on you pull your phone out, going through your contacts and finding the name you were after. You bite your lip in hesitation for a second before hitting the call button and holding the phone to your ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d You hear Chris Hemsworth answer after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris!\u201d You say. At some point around the time of the world premiere for Endgame, you and the majority of the cast had all exchanged numbers, and right now you were glad that happened.</p><p>\u201cY/N! How\u2019s it going? What can I do for you?\u201d Hemsworth was a person you absolutely loved to talk to. No matter what the circumstance, he always had such a positive energy and you know he helped Brie out a lot when it came to her introduction to the MCU.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in LA right now, yeah?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cI am! I just got back from Australia, like, two days ago.\u201d You breath a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Uh, listen, Brie\u2019s really not having a great day today. She found some videos online saying that the whole Avengers cast hates her and that she\u2019s ruining the MCU.\u201d</p><p>You hear Hemsworth mutter an \u201coh shit\u201d before you continue.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind maybe coming by to talk to her? I have a feeling it\u2019ll make her feel better hearing that it\u2019s all bullshit from one of you guys instead of just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Chris immediately exclaims. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll try do one better. Let me make some calls and I\u2019ll be \u2018round soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>Brie comes out of the bathroom and walks to the kitchen, where she finds you drinking a cup of coffee. She watches you for a moment and you offer her an affectionate smile before nodding your head in the direction of another mug sitting on the countertop.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s for you,\u201d you say and she smiles gratefully, walking further into the kitchen to pick the mug up and take a sip from it.</p><p>\n\u201cMm, I so needed this. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d You both continue drinking your coffees in relative silence for a while. You can see the shower has made Brie feel a little better, but her eyebrows are drawn together and you can see she is still stuck in her own thoughts.</p><p>\nYou glance at your phone to see if Hemsworth has texted you. At the lack of messages on your phone, you put it down on the countertop and look back at Brie. She draws her lower lip between her teeth, completely lost in her own thoughts, and you sigh, hoping Hemsworth gets here soon.</p><p>Right on cue, you hear your doorbell ring and Brie\u2019s head snaps towards the door. She looks back at you in question.</p><p>\u201cAre we expecting anyone today?\u201d She asks and you shrug as she makes her way to your front door and opens it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You hear Hemsworth shout in greeting before you see him step inside to hug Brie. She returns the hug before pulling back with a confused look on her face.</p><p>\u201cHemsworth. What brings you here?\u201d She asks, though you can already see a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not excited to see me?\u201d Chris says. His mouth turns to form a deep frown. Brie laughs at him before shoving him arm lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Chris chuckles and his smile finds its way back to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, a little birdie might have told me that you were having a pretty rough morning. So I\u2019m here to make sure you still have an amazing day. Let\u2019s go!\u201d He exclaims as he gestures with his arm for you and Brie to follow him before he disappears out the door again. Brie turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou called him?\u201d You shrug, thankfully sensing that Brie wasn\u2019t mad at you for calling Hemsworth. You walk towards her and her eyes study you carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou were breaking my heart,\u201d you say and you see her eyes begin to swim with tears. \u201cPlus, I\u2019d say the fact that he dropped everything to get here so quickly kinda proves he doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Brie lets out a laugh and quickly wipes at her eyes before her tears can properly fall.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Hemsworth says insistently, coming back through the door. \u201cGeez, at least you\u2019re not going around telling everyone you\u2019re the fastest avenger, eh?\u201d He offers a cheeky wink to Brie before dodging a punch she has aimed at his arm.</p><p>Brie shakes her head and laughs, grabbing your hand as the two of you follow him out.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>You and Brie find yourselves sitting in the backseat of Chris\u2019 car, and he drives for a little while before Brie finally speaks up.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you taking us?\u201d Chris smiles at you both through his rear-view mirror.</p><p>\u201cOnly the happiest place on earth, duh! Where else would I be taking you?\u201d Brie looks at you for a moment, her brow furrowing in confusion before she turns to Chris again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me we\u2019re going to Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep! It\u2019s guaranteed to cheer you up the second we get there. And on top of that, I might have also called in some of the squad who could make it.\u201d Brie\u2019s mouth drops open slightly.</p><p>\u201cWait, really? You\u2019re really all doing this because I was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Of course. We\u2019re a family, you know.\u201d Brie smiles a disbelieving smile and you see more tears form in her eyes. You take her hand and squeeze it in reassurance. \u201cBesides, you know all the haters are just jealous of our friendship. Let\u2019s be real. All banter aside, we are the two strongest avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>The car slows down and you look to see that you have arrived. Hemsworth parks the car and the three of you get out.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re meeting everyone near the side of the entrance, over this way.\u201d You follow him down near the entrance where he leads you to the group, who are trying to be subtle to avoid the attention of fans before they even get inside the park.</p><p>Everyone immediately cheers in greeting as you join them. The group consists of Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Don Cheadle. Everyone hugs one another before deciding to head into the park.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m at Disneyland right now without my kids. This is awesome,\u201d Paul says, earning a laugh from the group as you all pay for your tickets and enter the park. You begin walking down Main Street, USA and, to no one\u2019s surprise, fans immediately begin recognising the group.</p><p>They all are happy to oblige when fans ask to take a quick photo, and you stand back and admire the group of people you regularly get to associate with. You all make your way through the park, stopping to get ice cream and to purchase Mickey Mouse ears which you all proudly wear.</p><p>You and Brie walk hand in hand with the rest of the group and you look over to Brie to find a huge smile on her face. Your heart warms at the sight and you mirror the smile on your own face.</p><p>Because you had arrived partway through the day, you are all aware that you have limited time to go on rides and hang out with each other before the fireworks show starts later in the evening. You all decide to head to Tomorrowland first, of course heading straight for Space Mountain and some of the other rides.</p><p>Hemsworth insists that everyone has to get a photo together with Mickie and Minnie, which turns out to be difficult with he size of the group but also a great deal of fun choosing which poses to go with.</p><p>As you continue walking through Disneyland, you and Brie continue to walk contently with each other, trailing towards the back of the group. Mackie and Sebastian are acting as unofficial leaders for the day, leading the pack from one place to another while everyone else loudly talks among themselves.</p><p>Somewhere between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Cheadle breaks away from his conversation with Evans to drop back and join you and Brie.</p><p>\u201cHey. Listen, Brie. You know anything those guys have to say online is bullshit, right? I mean, you\u2019ve got to know how much we all love you.\u201d Brie takes in a deep breath and sighs, looking at Cheadle.</p><p>\u201cI do know. I guess it just really got to me today, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d Cheadle nods, complete sincerity in his tone. \u201cThey\u2019re only coming for you because you\u2019re a strong woman standing up for what\u2019s right and they\u2019re just threatened by you. That\u2019s literally all it is. I\u2019d probably even take it as a compliment if I were you.\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good way of looking at it. Thanks, Don. It means a lot.\u201d Your group stops walking so some fans can get photos and Brie takes the opportunity to hug Cheadle.</p><p>\n\u201cAny time, Brie.\u201d He smiles at her before Evans calls him back over. The group starts moving again and Scarlett drops back to walk with you two now.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve been stopped a lot for photos, but it\u2019s actually kind of a nice break after that press tour, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Brie quickly nods.</p><p>\u201cOh, one hundred percent. That press tour was on a whole other level.\u201d You know how tough press tours can be for Brie, and she practically did back-to-back press tours for Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame, two of the biggest movies in the past year.</p><p>You\u2019d only travelled with her for part of the Endgame press tour, so while you\u2019d been at home you\u2019d received a lot of phone calls and FaceTimes from Brie, many of which she would break down in tears because of just how exhausted she was. She also missed having you by her side, which is why she\u2019d asked you to join her during the Endgame tour.</p><p>\u201cOkay guys! Let\u2019s stop to eat some food, then we\u2019re heading to Space Mountain again before the fireworks. Sound good?\u201d Mackie announces to the group, receiving a positive answer as he leads them towards the nearest restaurant.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p><br/></p><p>After going on Space Mountain again, you and the cast head off to find the perfect spot to sit and watch the fireworks together.<br/><br/>\n\u201cBrie,\u201d you hear from behind you as Hemsworth runs up to you and Brie. \u201cCan we get a selfie?\u201d He points at his phone and offers a grin.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brie happily agrees. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for? Instagram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m planning on putting up some photos that are just a massive \u2018fuck you\u2019 to all the guys hating on you and saying we don\u2019t like you. Plus, our whole group is just full of really hot people. I kinda want to use that for the likes, you know?\u201d Brie laughs and shakes her head before her and Chris pose for a selfie, still both proudly wearing their Mickey ears.</p><p>Eventually, everyone decides on a spot to sit and watch the fireworks. Brie sits off slightly to the side of everyone else to give you both a little privacy, and gestures for you to sit between her legs in front of her. You do and she doesn\u2019t waste any time wrapping her arms comfortably around your waist.</p><p>When the fireworks begin, Brie pulls you in closer and you lean into her body, feeling her chin coming to rest on your shoulder. Your hands rest on top of hers as you watch the show.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you hear Brie say next to your ear. You turn your head slightly to look at her.</p><p>\n\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor everything. You turned a pretty shitty day into one that I completely loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s no problem, Brie. But it definitely wasn\u2019t just me who did all of this.\u201d Brie presses her lips to your shoulder and you can feel the smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. But we both know that if it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be so happy right now.\u201d You shrug lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell. You know I would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, this is gonna sound super sappy, but you\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met and I\u2019m so glad I get to call you mine.\u201d You chuckle, a smile plastered on your face and you turn to capture Brie\u2019s lips in a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you mumble against her lips. The corners of Brie\u2019s eyes crinkle as she grins at you.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",

Everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says weakly. You give her a disbelieving look.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine to me. What happened?\u201d You speak gently and she sighs as another tear rolls down her cheek. You wipe it away with your thumb and wait patiently before Brie grabs her laptop and shows you the screen.</p><p>She\u2019s got Youtube open, and she\u2019s searched her own name in the search bar. You look at some of the videos listed on the page. They range from \u2018How Brie Larson is ruining the MCU\u2019 to \u2018Proof that the Avengers cast hate Brie Larson\u2019. You sigh and look at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, what were even doing looking at this stuff? You know it\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d She shrugs weakly and you shut her laptop and put it aside.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were gone, I went on Twitter and saw all these guys posting about me and how Don and Chris clearly hate me.\u201d You place your hand on Brie\u2019s thigh to comfort her and she drops her hand onto of yours, tracing the back of your hand with her thumb. \u201cI mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I guess it just hit me hard today. Especially when I saw all the videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you should extend that stay away from social media then, hm?\u201d You say gently. Brie sadly hums in response and wraps you in a tight embrace.</p><p>Since the end of the press tour, Brie had been overwhelmed with the amount of attention she\u2019d received, both good and bad, and had decided on a much needed break from social media. You knew that as she\u2019d gotten more popular, she\u2019d had difficulty dealing with the attention because of her introverted nature, and she needed these breaks from time to time.</p><p>\u201cHey, how about we go out and do something today? We can forget all about the trolls of the internet for a little while.\u201d You kiss Brie on the cheek and she leans into your body more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Y/N. I\u2019m just really not in the mood today.\u201d She pulls away from your embrace and stands, rubbing her face with her hand before she smiles at you sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You stand up to join her, taking her hands in your own and holding them between you.</p><p>\u201cBrie, you have absolutely nothing to apologise for. You hear me?\u201d Your words are gentle and you see the smallest of smiles cross her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she nods. Her eyes hold a warmth for you as she holds your gaze. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna jump in the shower. Maybe it\u2019ll make me feel a little better.\u201d You nod at her and watch her walk into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>When you hear the shower turn on you pull your phone out, going through your contacts and finding the name you were after. You bite your lip in hesitation for a second before hitting the call button and holding the phone to your ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d You hear Chris Hemsworth answer after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris!\u201d You say. At some point around the time of the world premiere for Endgame, you and the majority of the cast had all exchanged numbers, and right now you were glad that happened.</p><p>\u201cY/N! How\u2019s it going? What can I do for you?\u201d Hemsworth was a person you absolutely loved to talk to. No matter what the circumstance, he always had such a positive energy and you know he helped Brie out a lot when it came to her introduction to the MCU.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in LA right now, yeah?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cI am! I just got back from Australia, like, two days ago.\u201d You breath a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Uh, listen, Brie\u2019s really not having a great day today. She found some videos online saying that the whole Avengers cast hates her and that she\u2019s ruining the MCU.\u201d</p><p>You hear Hemsworth mutter an \u201coh shit\u201d before you continue.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind maybe coming by to talk to her? I have a feeling it\u2019ll make her feel better hearing that it\u2019s all bullshit from one of you guys instead of just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Chris immediately exclaims. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll try do one better. Let me make some calls and I\u2019ll be \u2018round soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Brie comes out of the bathroom and walks to the kitchen, where she finds you drinking a cup of coffee. She watches you for a moment and you offer her an affectionate smile before nodding your head in the direction of another mug sitting on the countertop.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s for you,\u201d you say and she smiles gratefully, walking further into the kitchen to pick the mug up and take a sip from it.</p><p>\n\u201cMm, I so needed this. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d You both continue drinking your coffees in relative silence for a while. You can see the shower has made Brie feel a little better, but her eyebrows are drawn together and you can see she is still stuck in her own thoughts.</p><p>\nYou glance at your phone to see if Hemsworth has texted you. At the lack of messages on your phone, you put it down on the countertop and look back at Brie. She draws her lower lip between her teeth, completely lost in her own thoughts, and you sigh, hoping Hemsworth gets here soon.</p><p>Right on cue, you hear your doorbell ring and Brie\u2019s head snaps towards the door. She looks back at you in question.</p><p>\u201cAre we expecting anyone today?\u201d She asks and you shrug as she makes her way to your front door and opens it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You hear Hemsworth shout in greeting before you see him step inside to hug Brie. She returns the hug before pulling back with a confused look on her face.</p><p>\u201cHemsworth. What brings you here?\u201d She asks, though you can already see a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not excited to see me?\u201d Chris says. His mouth turns to form a deep frown. Brie laughs at him before shoving him arm lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Chris chuckles and his smile finds its way back to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, a little birdie might have told me that you were having a pretty rough morning. So I\u2019m here to make sure you still have an amazing day. Let\u2019s go!\u201d He exclaims as he gestures with his arm for you and Brie to follow him before he disappears out the door again. Brie turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou called him?\u201d You shrug, thankfully sensing that Brie wasn\u2019t mad at you for calling Hemsworth. You walk towards her and her eyes study you carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou were breaking my heart,\u201d you say and you see her eyes begin to swim with tears. \u201cPlus, I\u2019d say the fact that he dropped everything to get here so quickly kinda proves he doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Brie lets out a laugh and quickly wipes at her eyes before her tears can properly fall.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Hemsworth says insistently, coming back through the door. \u201cGeez, at least you\u2019re not going around telling everyone you\u2019re the fastest avenger, eh?\u201d He offers a cheeky wink to Brie before dodging a punch she has aimed at his arm.</p><p>Brie shakes her head and laughs, grabbing your hand as the two of you follow him out.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You and Brie find yourselves sitting in the backseat of Chris\u2019 car, and he drives for a little while before Brie finally speaks up.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you taking us?\u201d Chris smiles at you both through his rear-view mirror.</p><p>\u201cOnly the happiest place on earth, duh! Where else would I be taking you?\u201d Brie looks at you for a moment, her brow furrowing in confusion before she turns to Chris again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me we\u2019re going to Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep! It\u2019s guaranteed to cheer you up the second we get there. And on top of that, I might have also called in some of the squad who could make it.\u201d Brie\u2019s mouth drops open slightly.</p><p>\u201cWait, really? You\u2019re really all doing this because I was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Of course. We\u2019re a family, you know.\u201d Brie smiles a disbelieving smile and you see more tears form in her eyes. You take her hand and squeeze it in reassurance. \u201cBesides, you know all the haters are just jealous of our friendship. Let\u2019s be real. All banter aside, we are the two strongest avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>The car slows down and you look to see that you have arrived. Hemsworth parks the car and the three of you get out.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re meeting everyone near the side of the entrance, over this way.\u201d You follow him down near the entrance where he leads you to the group, who are trying to be subtle to avoid the attention of fans before they even get inside the park.</p><p>Everyone immediately cheers in greeting as you join them. The group consists of Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Don Cheadle. Everyone hugs one another before deciding to head into the park.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m at Disneyland right now without my kids. This is awesome,\u201d Paul says, earning a laugh from the group as you all pay for your tickets and enter the park. You begin walking down Main Street, USA and, to no one\u2019s surprise, fans immediately begin recognising the group.</p><p>They all are happy to oblige when fans ask to take a quick photo, and you stand back and admire the group of people you regularly get to associate with. You all make your way through the park, stopping to get ice cream and to purchase Mickey Mouse ears which you all proudly wear.</p><p>You and Brie walk hand in hand with the rest of the group and you look over to Brie to find a huge smile on her face. Your heart warms at the sight and you mirror the smile on your own face.</p><p>Because you had arrived partway through the day, you are all aware that you have limited time to go on rides and hang out with each other before the fireworks show starts later in the evening. You all decide to head to Tomorrowland first, of course heading straight for Space Mountain and some of the other rides.</p><p>Hemsworth insists that everyone has to get a photo together with Mickie and Minnie, which turns out to be difficult with he size of the group but also a great deal of fun choosing which poses to go with.</p><p>As you continue walking through Disneyland, you and Brie continue to walk contently with each other, trailing towards the back of the group. Mackie and Sebastian are acting as unofficial leaders for the day, leading the pack from one place to another while everyone else loudly talks among themselves.</p><p>Somewhere between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Cheadle breaks away from his conversation with Evans to drop back and join you and Brie.</p><p>\u201cHey. Listen, Brie. You know anything those guys have to say online is bullshit, right? I mean, you\u2019ve got to know how much we all love you.\u201d Brie takes in a deep breath and sighs, looking at Cheadle.</p><p>\u201cI do know. I guess it just really got to me today, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d Cheadle nods, complete sincerity in his tone. \u201cThey\u2019re only coming for you because you\u2019re a strong woman standing up for what\u2019s right and they\u2019re just threatened by you. That\u2019s literally all it is. I\u2019d probably even take it as a compliment if I were you.\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good way of looking at it. Thanks, Don. It means a lot.\u201d Your group stops walking so some fans can get photos and Brie takes the opportunity to hug Cheadle.</p><p>\n\u201cAny time, Brie.\u201d He smiles at her before Evans calls him back over. The group starts moving again and Scarlett drops back to walk with you two now.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve been stopped a lot for photos, but it\u2019s actually kind of a nice break after that press tour, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Brie quickly nods.</p><p>\u201cOh, one hundred percent. That press tour was on a whole other level.\u201d You know how tough press tours can be for Brie, and she practically did back-to-back press tours for Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame, two of the biggest movies in the past year.</p><p>You\u2019d only travelled with her for part of the Endgame press tour, so while you\u2019d been at home you\u2019d received a lot of phone calls and FaceTimes from Brie, many of which she would break down in tears because of just how exhausted she was. She also missed having you by her side, which is why she\u2019d asked you to join her during the Endgame tour.</p><p>\u201cOkay guys! Let\u2019s stop to eat some food, then we\u2019re heading to Space Mountain again before the fireworks. Sound good?\u201d Mackie announces to the group, receiving a positive answer as he leads them towards the nearest restaurant.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After going on Space Mountain again, you and the cast head off to find the perfect spot to sit and watch the fireworks together.<br><br>\n\u201cBrie,\u201d you hear from behind you as Hemsworth runs up to you and Brie. \u201cCan we get a selfie?\u201d He points at his phone and offers a grin.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brie happily agrees. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for? Instagram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m planning on putting up some photos that are just a massive \u2018fuck you\u2019 to all the guys hating on you and saying we don\u2019t like you. Plus, our whole group is just full of really hot people. I kinda want to use that for the likes, you know?\u201d Brie laughs and shakes her head before her and Chris pose for a selfie, still both proudly wearing their Mickey ears.</p><p>Eventually, everyone decides on a spot to sit and watch the fireworks. Brie sits off slightly to the side of everyone else to give you both a little privacy, and gestures for you to sit between her legs in front of her. You do and she doesn\u2019t waste any time wrapping her arms comfortably around your waist.</p><p>When the fireworks begin, Brie pulls you in closer and you lean into her body, feeling her chin coming to rest on your shoulder. Your hands rest on top of hers as you watch the show.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you hear Brie say next to your ear. You turn your head slightly to look at her.</p><p>\n\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor everything. You turned a pretty shitty day into one that I completely loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s no problem, Brie. But it definitely wasn\u2019t just me who did all of this.\u201d Brie presses her lips to your shoulder and you can feel the smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. But we both know that if it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be so happy right now.\u201d You shrug lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell. You know I would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, this is gonna sound super sappy, but you\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met and I\u2019m so glad I get to call you mine.\u201d You chuckle, a smile plastered on your face and you turn to capture Brie\u2019s lips in a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you mumble against her lips. The corners of Brie\u2019s eyes crinkle as she grins at you.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",

You groan slightly, snuggling closer to Brie. She pulls you in towards her, pressing a kiss to your neck before she leans over you and kisses you on the lips. You hum into the kiss and she pulls back, smiling softly at you.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she says with a slight rasp to her voice. You lift a hand to tuck a strand of her short hair behind her ear and out of her face.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, baby,\u201d you reply to her before reaching towards your phone. You glance at the time and then back at Brie. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up, I\u2019m supposed to be meeting some friends for breakfast.\u201d Brie immediately pouts.</p><p>\n\u201cWhat? No! Stay here and cuddle with me!\u201d You attempt to remove her arms from around you but she only tightens them. You huff and playfully glare at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie. I swear I\u2019ll be back so quickly you\u2019ll barely realise I\u2019ve gone. Then we can cuddle for as long as you want.\u201d Brie seems to contemplate your words for a moment before reluctantly releasing you from her hold.</p><p>\u201cFine. But you better be ready to cuddle me the second you get back.\u201d You chuckle at her and kiss the pout off her lips before getting out of bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>As promised, breakfast is only a quick outing and you\u2019re back at the house fairly quickly. You make your way to the bedroom where you assume Brie still is. Your confusion peaks, however, when you notice the curtains are drawn shut, the room shrouded in darkness. You can see Brie\u2019s figure sitting on the bed and her laptop in front of her shines some light onto her features.<br></p><p>\u201cUhh. Babe, this is very ominous, don\u2019t you think?\u201d You startle Brie and immediately notice when she swipes at her face, clearly wiping away tears.</p><p>\u201cBrie?\u201d You automatically rush to her, placing yourself on the bed in front of her and resting your hands on her face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d You wipe at the tears she missed and watch her closely, trying to focus on her eyes through the dark of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says weakly. You give her a disbelieving look.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine to me. What happened?\u201d You speak gently and she sighs as another tear rolls down her cheek. You wipe it away with your thumb and wait patiently before Brie grabs her laptop and shows you the screen.</p><p>She\u2019s got Youtube open, and she\u2019s searched her own name in the search bar. You look at some of the videos listed on the page. They range from \u2018How Brie Larson is ruining the MCU\u2019 to \u2018Proof that the Avengers cast hate Brie Larson\u2019. You sigh and look at her.</p><p>\u201cBrie, what were even doing looking at this stuff? You know it\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d She shrugs weakly and you shut her laptop and put it aside.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were gone, I went on Twitter and saw all these guys posting about me and how Don and Chris clearly hate me.\u201d You place your hand on Brie\u2019s thigh to comfort her and she drops her hand onto of yours, tracing the back of your hand with her thumb. \u201cI mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I guess it just hit me hard today. Especially when I saw all the videos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you should extend that stay away from social media then, hm?\u201d You say gently. Brie sadly hums in response and wraps you in a tight embrace.</p><p>Since the end of the press tour, Brie had been overwhelmed with the amount of attention she\u2019d received, both good and bad, and had decided on a much needed break from social media. You knew that as she\u2019d gotten more popular, she\u2019d had difficulty dealing with the attention because of her introverted nature, and she needed these breaks from time to time.</p><p>\u201cHey, how about we go out and do something today? We can forget all about the trolls of the internet for a little while.\u201d You kiss Brie on the cheek and she leans into your body more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Y/N. I\u2019m just really not in the mood today.\u201d She pulls away from your embrace and stands, rubbing her face with her hand before she smiles at you sadly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You stand up to join her, taking her hands in your own and holding them between you.</p><p>\u201cBrie, you have absolutely nothing to apologise for. You hear me?\u201d Your words are gentle and you see the smallest of smiles cross her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she nods. Her eyes hold a warmth for you as she holds your gaze. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna jump in the shower. Maybe it\u2019ll make me feel a little better.\u201d You nod at her and watch her walk into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>When you hear the shower turn on you pull your phone out, going through your contacts and finding the name you were after. You bite your lip in hesitation for a second before hitting the call button and holding the phone to your ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d You hear Chris Hemsworth answer after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chris!\u201d You say. At some point around the time of the world premiere for Endgame, you and the majority of the cast had all exchanged numbers, and right now you were glad that happened.</p><p>\u201cY/N! How\u2019s it going? What can I do for you?\u201d Hemsworth was a person you absolutely loved to talk to. No matter what the circumstance, he always had such a positive energy and you know he helped Brie out a lot when it came to her introduction to the MCU.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in LA right now, yeah?\u201d You ask.</p><p>\u201cI am! I just got back from Australia, like, two days ago.\u201d You breath a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Uh, listen, Brie\u2019s really not having a great day today. She found some videos online saying that the whole Avengers cast hates her and that she\u2019s ruining the MCU.\u201d</p><p>You hear Hemsworth mutter an \u201coh shit\u201d before you continue.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind maybe coming by to talk to her? I have a feeling it\u2019ll make her feel better hearing that it\u2019s all bullshit from one of you guys instead of just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Chris immediately exclaims. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll try do one better. Let me make some calls and I\u2019ll be \u2018round soon, yeah?\u201d</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>Brie comes out of the bathroom and walks to the kitchen, where she finds you drinking a cup of coffee. She watches you for a moment and you offer her an affectionate smile before nodding your head in the direction of another mug sitting on the countertop.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s for you,\u201d you say and she smiles gratefully, walking further into the kitchen to pick the mug up and take a sip from it.</p><p>\n\u201cMm, I so needed this. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d You both continue drinking your coffees in relative silence for a while. You can see the shower has made Brie feel a little better, but her eyebrows are drawn together and you can see she is still stuck in her own thoughts.</p><p>\nYou glance at your phone to see if Hemsworth has texted you. At the lack of messages on your phone, you put it down on the countertop and look back at Brie. She draws her lower lip between her teeth, completely lost in her own thoughts, and you sigh, hoping Hemsworth gets here soon.</p><p>Right on cue, you hear your doorbell ring and Brie\u2019s head snaps towards the door. She looks back at you in question.</p><p>\u201cAre we expecting anyone today?\u201d She asks and you shrug as she makes her way to your front door and opens it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You hear Hemsworth shout in greeting before you see him step inside to hug Brie. She returns the hug before pulling back with a confused look on her face.</p><p>\u201cHemsworth. What brings you here?\u201d She asks, though you can already see a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not excited to see me?\u201d Chris says. His mouth turns to form a deep frown. Brie laughs at him before shoving him arm lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d Chris chuckles and his smile finds its way back to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, a little birdie might have told me that you were having a pretty rough morning. So I\u2019m here to make sure you still have an amazing day. Let\u2019s go!\u201d He exclaims as he gestures with his arm for you and Brie to follow him before he disappears out the door again. Brie turns to look at you.</p><p>\u201cYou called him?\u201d You shrug, thankfully sensing that Brie wasn\u2019t mad at you for calling Hemsworth. You walk towards her and her eyes study you carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou were breaking my heart,\u201d you say and you see her eyes begin to swim with tears. \u201cPlus, I\u2019d say the fact that he dropped everything to get here so quickly kinda proves he doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Brie lets out a laugh and quickly wipes at her eyes before her tears can properly fall.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Hemsworth says insistently, coming back through the door. \u201cGeez, at least you\u2019re not going around telling everyone you\u2019re the fastest avenger, eh?\u201d He offers a cheeky wink to Brie before dodging a punch she has aimed at his arm.</p><p>Brie shakes her head and laughs, grabbing your hand as the two of you follow him out.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>You and Brie find yourselves sitting in the backseat of Chris\u2019 car, and he drives for a little while before Brie finally speaks up.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are you taking us?\u201d Chris smiles at you both through his rear-view mirror.</p><p>\u201cOnly the happiest place on earth, duh! Where else would I be taking you?\u201d Brie looks at you for a moment, her brow furrowing in confusion before she turns to Chris again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me we\u2019re going to Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep! It\u2019s guaranteed to cheer you up the second we get there. And on top of that, I might have also called in some of the squad who could make it.\u201d Brie\u2019s mouth drops open slightly.</p><p>\u201cWait, really? You\u2019re really all doing this because I was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Of course. We\u2019re a family, you know.\u201d Brie smiles a disbelieving smile and you see more tears form in her eyes. You take her hand and squeeze it in reassurance. \u201cBesides, you know all the haters are just jealous of our friendship. Let\u2019s be real. All banter aside, we are the two strongest avengers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>The car slows down and you look to see that you have arrived. Hemsworth parks the car and the three of you get out.</p><p>\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re meeting everyone near the side of the entrance, over this way.\u201d You follow him down near the entrance where he leads you to the group, who are trying to be subtle to avoid the attention of fans before they even get inside the park.</p><p>Everyone immediately cheers in greeting as you join them. The group consists of Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd and Don Cheadle. Everyone hugs one another before deciding to head into the park.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m at Disneyland right now without my kids. This is awesome,\u201d Paul says, earning a laugh from the group as you all pay for your tickets and enter the park. You begin walking down Main Street, USA and, to no one\u2019s surprise, fans immediately begin recognising the group.</p><p>They all are happy to oblige when fans ask to take a quick photo, and you stand back and admire the group of people you regularly get to associate with. You all make your way through the park, stopping to get ice cream and to purchase Mickey Mouse ears which you all proudly wear.</p><p>You and Brie walk hand in hand with the rest of the group and you look over to Brie to find a huge smile on her face. Your heart warms at the sight and you mirror the smile on your own face.</p><p>Because you had arrived partway through the day, you are all aware that you have limited time to go on rides and hang out with each other before the fireworks show starts later in the evening. You all decide to head to Tomorrowland first, of course heading straight for Space Mountain and some of the other rides.</p><p>Hemsworth insists that everyone has to get a photo together with Mickie and Minnie, which turns out to be difficult with he size of the group but also a great deal of fun choosing which poses to go with.</p><p>As you continue walking through Disneyland, you and Brie continue to walk contently with each other, trailing towards the back of the group. Mackie and Sebastian are acting as unofficial leaders for the day, leading the pack from one place to another while everyone else loudly talks among themselves.</p><p>Somewhere between Fantasyland and Frontierland, Cheadle breaks away from his conversation with Evans to drop back and join you and Brie.</p><p>\u201cHey. Listen, Brie. You know anything those guys have to say online is bullshit, right? I mean, you\u2019ve got to know how much we all love you.\u201d Brie takes in a deep breath and sighs, looking at Cheadle.</p><p>\u201cI do know. I guess it just really got to me today, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d Cheadle nods, complete sincerity in his tone. \u201cThey\u2019re only coming for you because you\u2019re a strong woman standing up for what\u2019s right and they\u2019re just threatened by you. That\u2019s literally all it is. I\u2019d probably even take it as a compliment if I were you.\u201d Brie laughs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good way of looking at it. Thanks, Don. It means a lot.\u201d Your group stops walking so some fans can get photos and Brie takes the opportunity to hug Cheadle.</p><p>\n\u201cAny time, Brie.\u201d He smiles at her before Evans calls him back over. The group starts moving again and Scarlett drops back to walk with you two now.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve been stopped a lot for photos, but it\u2019s actually kind of a nice break after that press tour, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Brie quickly nods.</p><p>\u201cOh, one hundred percent. That press tour was on a whole other level.\u201d You know how tough press tours can be for Brie, and she practically did back-to-back press tours for Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame, two of the biggest movies in the past year.</p><p>You\u2019d only travelled with her for part of the Endgame press tour, so while you\u2019d been at home you\u2019d received a lot of phone calls and FaceTimes from Brie, many of which she would break down in tears because of just how exhausted she was. She also missed having you by her side, which is why she\u2019d asked you to join her during the Endgame tour.</p><p>\u201cOkay guys! Let\u2019s stop to eat some food, then we\u2019re heading to Space Mountain again before the fireworks. Sound good?\u201d Mackie announces to the group, receiving a positive answer as he leads them towards the nearest restaurant.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>After going on Space Mountain again, you and the cast head off to find the perfect spot to sit and watch the fireworks together.<br><br>\n\u201cBrie,\u201d you hear from behind you as Hemsworth runs up to you and Brie. \u201cCan we get a selfie?\u201d He points at his phone and offers a grin.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Brie happily agrees. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for? Instagram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m planning on putting up some photos that are just a massive \u2018fuck you\u2019 to all the guys hating on you and saying we don\u2019t like you. Plus, our whole group is just full of really hot people. I kinda want to use that for the likes, you know?\u201d Brie laughs and shakes her head before her and Chris pose for a selfie, still both proudly wearing their Mickey ears.</p><p>Eventually, everyone decides on a spot to sit and watch the fireworks. Brie sits off slightly to the side of everyone else to give you both a little privacy, and gestures for you to sit between her legs in front of her. You do and she doesn\u2019t waste any time wrapping her arms comfortably around your waist.</p><p>When the fireworks begin, Brie pulls you in closer and you lean into her body, feeling her chin coming to rest on your shoulder. Your hands rest on top of hers as you watch the show.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d you hear Brie say next to your ear. You turn your head slightly to look at her.</p><p>\n\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor everything. You turned a pretty shitty day into one that I completely loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s no problem, Brie. But it definitely wasn\u2019t just me who did all of this.\u201d Brie presses her lips to your shoulder and you can feel the smile on your face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. But we both know that if it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be so happy right now.\u201d You shrug lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell. You know I would do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, this is gonna sound super sappy, but you\u2019re the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met and I\u2019m so glad I get to call you mine.\u201d You chuckle, a smile plastered on your face and you turn to capture Brie\u2019s lips in a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d you mumble against her lips. The corners of Brie\u2019s eyes crinkle as she grins at you.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>",
                "content": "<p><b>Requests:&nbsp;</b></p><p>Anonymous: So I just read Home and you did absolutely wonderful. I felt so much fluff, I was grinning the whole time. If you are still taking requests, can you do a continuation of Home where Brie kind of gets sad because of all the hate she is getting (she doesn&rsquo;t deserve it) and the reader comforts her together with the rest of the mcu cast especially Hemsworth and Cheadle. Thank you.</p><p>Anonymous:<b>&nbsp;</b>i loved your Home one shot! can you do one where brie and her non famous girlfriend are hanging out at Disneyland with the other cast after she is done with press</p><p><b>Pairing: </b>Brie x reader</p><p><b>A/N:</b>&nbsp;Wooow I&rsquo;m posting this much later than I meant to. Thank you both for the love and for the requests!! I love both of these requests and thought they would kinda work well together so here it is! Enjoy!!</p><figure data-tumblr-media-id=\"0\" class=\"tmblr-full\"></figure><p>The feeling of strong arms wrapping around you wakes you up. You groan slightly, snuggling closer to Brie. She pulls you in towards her, pressing a kiss to your neck before she leans over you and kisses you on the lips. You hum into the kiss and she pulls back, smiling softly at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; she says with a slight rasp to her voice. You lift a hand to tuck a strand of her short hair behind her ear and out of her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, baby,&rdquo; you reply to her before reaching towards your phone. You glance at the time and then back at Brie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get up, I&rsquo;m supposed to be meeting some friends for breakfast.&rdquo; Brie immediately pouts.</p><p>\n&ldquo;What? No! Stay here and cuddle with me!&rdquo; You attempt to remove her arms from around you but she only tightens them. You huff and playfully glare at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Brie. I swear I&rsquo;ll be back so quickly you&rsquo;ll barely realise I&rsquo;ve gone. Then we can cuddle for as long as you want.&rdquo; Brie seems to contemplate your words for a moment before reluctantly releasing you from her hold.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. But you better be ready to cuddle me the second you get back.&rdquo; You chuckle at her and kiss the pout off her lips before getting out of bed.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a deal.&rdquo;</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>As promised, breakfast is only a quick outing and you&rsquo;re back at the house fairly quickly. You make your way to the bedroom where you assume Brie still is. Your confusion peaks, however, when you notice the curtains are drawn shut, the room shrouded in darkness. You can see Brie&rsquo;s figure sitting on the bed and her laptop in front of her shines some light onto her features.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Uhh. Babe, this is very ominous, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; You startle Brie and immediately notice when she swipes at her face, clearly wiping away tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Brie?&rdquo; You automatically rush to her, placing yourself on the bed in front of her and resting your hands on her face. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; You wipe at the tears she missed and watch her closely, trying to focus on her eyes through the dark of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Everything&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she says weakly. You give her a disbelieving look.</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look fine to me. What happened?&rdquo; You speak gently and she sighs as another tear rolls down her cheek. You wipe it away with your thumb and wait patiently before Brie grabs her laptop and shows you the screen.</p><p>She&rsquo;s got Youtube open, and she&rsquo;s searched her own name in the search bar. You look at some of the videos listed on the page. They range from &lsquo;How Brie Larson is ruining the MCU&rsquo; to &lsquo;Proof that the Avengers cast hate Brie Larson&rsquo;. You sigh and look at her.</p><p>&ldquo;Brie, what were even doing looking at this stuff? You know it&rsquo;s all bullshit.&rdquo; She shrugs weakly and you shut her laptop and put it aside.</p><p>&ldquo;While you were gone, I went on Twitter and saw all these guys posting about me and how Don and Chris clearly hate me.&rdquo; You place your hand on Brie&rsquo;s thigh to comfort her and she drops her hand onto of yours, tracing the back of your hand with her thumb. &ldquo;I mean, I kind of knew it was happening. I guess it just hit me hard today. Especially when I saw all the videos.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like you should extend that stay away from social media then, hm?&rdquo; You say gently. Brie sadly hums in response and wraps you in a tight embrace.</p><p>Since the end of the press tour, Brie had been overwhelmed with the amount of attention she&rsquo;d received, both good and bad, and had decided on a much needed break from social media. You knew that as she&rsquo;d gotten more popular, she&rsquo;d had difficulty dealing with the attention because of her introverted nature, and she needed these breaks from time to time.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, how about we go out and do something today? We can forget all about the trolls of the internet for a little while.&rdquo; You kiss Brie on the cheek and she leans into your body more.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Y/N. I&rsquo;m just really not in the mood today.&rdquo; She pulls away from your embrace and stands, rubbing her face with her hand before she smiles at you sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; You stand up to join her, taking her hands in your own and holding them between you.</p><p>&ldquo;Brie, you have absolutely nothing to apologise for. You hear me?&rdquo; Your words are gentle and you see the smallest of smiles cross her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she nods. Her eyes hold a warmth for you as she holds your gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gonna jump in the shower. Maybe it&rsquo;ll make me feel a little better.&rdquo; You nod at her and watch her walk into the bathroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>When you hear the shower turn on you pull your phone out, going through your contacts and finding the name you were after. You bite your lip in hesitation for a second before hitting the call button and holding the phone to your ear.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; You hear Chris Hemsworth answer after a few moments.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Chris!&rdquo; You say.

She also missed having you by her side, which is why she&rsquo;d asked you to join her during the Endgame tour.</p><p>&ldquo;Okay guys! Let&rsquo;s stop to eat some food, then we&rsquo;re heading to Space Mountain again before the fireworks. Sound good?&rdquo; Mackie announces to the group, receiving a positive answer as he leads them towards the nearest restaurant.</p><p><br /></p><hr /><p><br /></p><p>After going on Space Mountain again, you and the cast head off to find the perfect spot to sit and watch the fireworks together.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;Brie,&rdquo; you hear from behind you as Hemsworth runs up to you and Brie. &ldquo;Can we get a selfie?&rdquo; He points at his phone and offers a grin.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Brie happily agrees. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this for? Instagram?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;m planning on putting up some photos that are just a massive &lsquo;fuck you&rsquo; to all the guys hating on you and saying we don&rsquo;t like you. Plus, our whole group is just full of really hot people. I kinda want to use that for the likes, you know?&rdquo; Brie laughs and shakes her head before her and Chris pose for a selfie, still both proudly wearing their Mickey ears.</p><p>Eventually, everyone decides on a spot to sit and watch the fireworks. Brie sits off slightly to the side of everyone else to give you both a little privacy, and gestures for you to sit between her legs in front of her. You do and she doesn&rsquo;t waste any time wrapping her arms comfortably around your waist.</p><p>When the fireworks begin, Brie pulls you in closer and you lean into her body, feeling her chin coming to rest on your shoulder. Your hands rest on top of hers as you watch the show.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; you hear Brie say next to your ear. You turn your head slightly to look at her.</p><p>\n&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For everything. You turned a pretty shitty day into one that I completely loved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s no problem, Brie. But it definitely wasn&rsquo;t just me who did all of this.&rdquo; Brie presses her lips to your shoulder and you can feel the smile on your face.</p><p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. But we both know that if it weren&rsquo;t for you, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so happy right now.&rdquo; You shrug lightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well. You know I would do anything for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God, this is gonna sound super sappy, but you&rsquo;re the most amazing person I&rsquo;ve ever met and I&rsquo;m so glad I get to call you mine.&rdquo; You chuckle, a smile plastered on your face and you turn to capture Brie&rsquo;s lips in a kiss.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; you mumble against her lips. The corners of Brie&rsquo;s eyes crinkle as she grins at you.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>",

If you are still taking requests, can you do a continuation of Home where Brie kind of gets sad because of all the hate she is getting (she doesn&rsquo;t deserve it) and the reader comforts her together with the rest of the mcu cast especially Hemsworth and Cheadle. Thank you.</p>\n<p>Anonymous:<b>&nbsp;</b>i loved your Home one shot! can you do one where brie and her non famous girlfriend are hanging out at Disneyland with the other cast after she is done with press</p>\n<p><b>Pairing: </b>Brie x reader</p>\n<p><b>A/N:</b>&nbsp;Wooow I&rsquo;m posting this much later than I meant to. Thank you both for the love and for the requests!! I love both of these requests and thought they would kinda work well together so here it is!

Get out!<br><br>\nI love photography and philosophy, so you will find some cool pics and random quotes.<br><br>\nI love powerful scenes, with strong women and a nice script.<br><br>\nI'm not a huge fan of movie theaters. My anxiety hates a room full of strangers and loud sounds...Ironically, because\nI have been working in the music industry for at least 15 years.<br><br>\nI'm such an easy-going person, if you call me 'ignorant' or wtvr; name calling does not make me read your argument...Try to educate me, I'm open for it.<br><br>\nThat's not all, but that's it for now.",

Carol Danvers x Talos, Platonic! Carol Danvers x Peter Parker, Platonic! Carol Danvers x Nick Fury</p><p>Summary: (SPOILER WARNING) After Carol returns to Earth she finds out that both Maria and Monica were lost in the snap. She and the other Avengers successfully kill Thanos, but Carol goes overboard in a fit of rage. She manages to calm down, going into space to help out those who were affected by the snap. She now helps planets whenever she can, while drowning herself in her own sorrows and self pity. Abruptly, the Avengers need her help with Thanos from another timeline and she realizes that they reversed the snap, giving her a chance to see her lover and daughter again.\u00a0</p><p>Word Count: 1,923</p><p>Writer\u2019s Note: Lot\u2019s of angst, a sad Carol but there will be fluff too :). It\u2019s a bit disjointed, but we all needed this in Endgame people I hope I delivered.\u00a0</p><hr><!-- more --><p>Carol glances down at the grass as she watches Tony and Pepper embrace. She would have flown through the galaxy, battling the stars, Kree and rogues all over again just to take Maria in her arms. But, all she came home to was dust, ash and a burnt pan where she assumed Maria was cooking. Tears escaped her, along with the glow of her hands that can with the frustration and anger she felt. She grabbed Maria\u2019s cellphone, calling Monica, yet she didn\u2019t answer. Her boyfriend, Tom picked up, frantic about Monica crumbling to dust in front of him. Carol let the anger consume her wholly, firing a photon blast through the ceiling of Maria\u2019s kitchen before leaping into the air with a bone curdling scream.\u00a0</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have me,\u201d Carol says to the Avengers numbly.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cLook, new girl,\u201d Rhodey starts,\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019re all about that superhero life but what-\u201d<br/></p><p>Carol cut him off.</p><p>\u201cYou think I wanted to be out there! Away from my family while they disappeared? I\u2019m getting that son of a bitch whether you\u2019re with me or not.\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve\u2019s jaw tightens but he nods.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, let\u2019s get the son of a bitch,\u201d he agreed.\u00a0<br/></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They caught Thanos alone. He was cooking something when Carol busted through his hut. All fire, hardly waiting for the avengers to catch up with her. A few photon blasts knocked him to the floor and Carol was on him again, arms firmly around his neck. Steve, Rhodey, Natasha, and Thor arrive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve asked.<br/></p><p>Carol\u2019s grip on Thanos tightened, nearly strangling him to death.</p><p>\u201cAnswer. Him,\u201d she growled.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cGone- I-I destroyed them,\u201d Thanos said,\u00a0\u201ci-if y-you\u2019re here now then, I was successful-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnit!\u201d Carol roared.<br/></p><p>It happened quickly. Thor tried to rush in first, eyes glowing blue with the lightning of Stormbreaker around him. Carol\u2019s move was swift, snapping Thanos\u2019 neck before Thor could reach. She let the titan\u2019s lifeless body drop, as Thor chopped off his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fuck was that!\u201d Rhodey shouted.<br/></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better that way,\u201d Carol said bluntly,\u00a0\u201cI avenged our family, friends, half of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Steve started.<br/></p><p>Carol didn\u2019t listen as she flew back into the air.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Talos found Carol in a bar on planet Krylor, drowning herself in the sorrows of whatever fine drinks she could get her hands on. He cringed when he found her, hunched over the bar with a friend, in silver armor, Brunnhilde.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo the new Queen of New Asguard!\u201d Carol beams as she downs her drink in one gulp.\u00a0</p><p>Brunnhilde gives Captain Marvel a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him,\u201d she says,\u00a0\u201call he does is drink and play&ndash; what are those things you mortals use to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVideo Games,\u201d Carol bellows.</p><p>She finally notices Talos glaring at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you needed me you could have&ndash;\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaged you. You\u2019re always in between planets, even got a new hair cut,\u201d Talos says as he sits next to Carol.</p><p>Carol runs a quick hand through her now short hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had that hair for over twenty five years, it got in the way and I needed a change,\u201d she says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Talos says before looking to Brunnhilde,\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re in company of a Queen, eh?\u201d</p><p>Carol nods,\u00a0\u201cTalos, Brunnhilde. My best friend, saved him back in\u00a0\u201895. Brunnhilde, Queen of New Asguard, met her back&ndash;\u201d</p><p>Carol cut herself off, staring down at the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFive years ago,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Talos glares between the two women. Brunnhilde takes the hint and rises from the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, New Asguard isn\u2019t going to govern itself,\u201d she says.</p><p>Before Brunnhilde leaves she puts a hand on Talos\u2019 shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d<br/></p><p>Talos gives her a sharp nod before stalking out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, is everyone all right?\u201d Carol asks.\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hanging in there Carol, better than we were a few years ago. Thanks to you,\u201d Talos says.<br/></p><p>Carol shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I can do now. Krylor still needs supplies&ndash; I\u2019m so close to finding more harvests for them. I need to.\u201d<br/></p><p>She rises, but Talos stops her.</p><p>\u201cCarol. Breathe,\u201d he instructs.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Carol gives him a hard look and sits back down, twirling the drink in her cup around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou lied you know,\u201d he says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not your best friend.\u201d<br/></p><p>Carol scoffs,\u00a0\u201cjust take the complement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know where I\u2019m getting at,\u201d he banters,\u00a0\u201cremember when I went through that head of yours?

She puts a hand on her face and exhales.</p><p>\u201cSay it, tell me,\u201d Talos whispers.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Carol chuckles, wiping her damp and red eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making me do this?\u201d she asks.<br/></p><p>Talos\u2019 eyes soften as he squeezes Carol\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou may be the strongest I\u2019ve ever known Carol, but you\u2019re still human. Still flesh and bone, you don\u2019t need to hold your emotions in anymore.

Maria\u2019s house was in fine condition, even the hole Carol blew in the roof five years prior was gone. The door swung open and there she was, Maria Rambeau. Her fellow pilot, partner, best friend, lover. Her home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC-Carol&ndash; oh God&ndash;\u201d Maria cried.</p><p>Carol ran up to her, taking the woman up into her arms in a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s you, I missed your hugs,\u201d Carol whispered into Maria\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cCarol, I&ndash; I thought you were&ndash;\u201d</p><p>Maria broke down as Carol pulled back to see her face. Her hair got longer, now coming down past her neck. Carol admired the muscle in her lover\u2019s arms as well, noticing how tight she held on.

For the both of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d she declared,\u00a0\u201cand I won\u2019t leave and let anything like that happened again.\u201d</p><p>Maria put on a weak smile and that was all it took for Carol to kiss her.

She would have flown through the galaxy, battling the stars, Kree and rogues all over again just to take Maria in her arms. But, all she came home to was dust, ash and a burnt pan where she assumed Maria was cooking. Tears escaped her, along with the glow of her hands that can with the frustration and anger she felt. She grabbed Maria\u2019s cellphone, calling Monica, yet she didn\u2019t answer. Her boyfriend, Tom picked up, frantic about Monica crumbling to dust in front of him. Carol let the anger consume her wholly, firing a photon blast through the ceiling of Maria\u2019s kitchen before leaping into the air with a bone curdling scream.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have me,\u201d Carol says to the Avengers numbly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLook, new girl,\u201d Rhodey starts,\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019re all about that superhero life but what-\u201d<br></p><p>Carol cut him off.</p><p>\u201cYou think I wanted to be out there! Away from my family while they disappeared? I\u2019m getting that son of a bitch whether you\u2019re with me or not.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve\u2019s jaw tightens but he nods.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, let\u2019s get the son of a bitch,\u201d he agreed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2026</p><p>They caught Thanos alone. He was cooking something when Carol busted through his hut. All fire, hardly waiting for the avengers to catch up with her. A few photon blasts knocked him to the floor and Carol was on him again, arms firmly around his neck. Steve, Rhodey, Natasha, and Thor arrive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve asked.<br></p><p>Carol\u2019s grip on Thanos tightened, nearly strangling him to death.</p><p>\u201cAnswer.

Thor tried to rush in first, eyes glowing blue with the lightning of Stormbreaker around him. Carol\u2019s move was swift, snapping Thanos\u2019 neck before Thor could reach. She let the titan\u2019s lifeless body drop, as Thor chopped off his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fuck was that!\u201d Rhodey shouted.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better that way,\u201d Carol said bluntly,\u00a0\u201cI avenged our family, friends, half of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Steve started.<br></p><p>Carol didn\u2019t listen as she flew back into the air.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Talos found Carol in a bar on planet Krylor, drowning herself in the sorrows of whatever fine drinks she could get her hands on. He cringed when he found her, hunched over the bar with a friend, in silver armor, Brunnhilde.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo the new Queen of New Asguard!\u201d Carol beams as she downs her drink in one gulp.\u00a0</p><p>Brunnhilde gives Captain Marvel a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him,\u201d she says,\u00a0\u201call he does is drink and play\u2013 what are those things you mortals use to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVideo Games,\u201d Carol bellows.</p><p>She finally notices Talos glaring at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you needed me you could have\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaged you.

Brunnhilde takes the hint and rises from the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, New Asguard isn\u2019t going to govern itself,\u201d she says.</p><p>Before Brunnhilde leaves she puts a hand on Talos\u2019 shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d<br></p><p>Talos gives her a sharp nod before stalking out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, is everyone all right?\u201d Carol asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hanging in there Carol, better than we were a few years ago. Thanks to you,\u201d Talos says.<br></p><p>Carol shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I can do now. Krylor still needs supplies\u2013 I\u2019m so close to finding more harvests for them.

She puts a hand on her face and exhales.</p><p>\u201cSay it, tell me,\u201d Talos whispers.\u00a0<br></p><p>Carol chuckles, wiping her damp and red eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making me do this?\u201d she asks.<br></p><p>Talos\u2019 eyes soften as he squeezes Carol\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou may be the strongest I\u2019ve ever known Carol, but you\u2019re still human.

She put her fist against her mouth to keep her composure.</p><p>\u201cF-Fury\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo see her,\u201d he said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d want some explaining, especially with that haircut.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughs and wipes her tears.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Fury,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>Nick shrugged and gasped when Carol pulled him into her arms.

Maria\u2019s house was in fine condition, even the hole Carol blew in the roof five years prior was gone. The door swung open and there she was, Maria Rambeau. Her fellow pilot, partner, best friend, lover. Her home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC-Carol\u2013 oh God\u2013\u201d Maria cried.</p><p>Carol ran up to her, taking the woman up into her arms in a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s you, I missed your hugs,\u201d Carol whispered into Maria\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cCarol, I\u2013 I thought you were\u2013\u201d</p><p>Maria broke down as Carol pulled back to see her face. Her hair got longer, now coming down past her neck. Carol admired the muscle in her lover\u2019s arms as well, noticing how tight she held on. She almost came to tears too, but she had to be strong now. For the both of them.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d she declared,\u00a0\u201cand I won\u2019t leave and let anything like that happened again.\u201d</p><p>Maria put on a weak smile and that was all it took for Carol to kiss her. Her hands found themselves around Maria\u2019s waist, while Maria ran her hands through Carol\u2019s now short hair.\u00a0</p><p>Maria pulled back breathlessly and gazed fondly into Carol\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHaircut?\u201d</p><p>Carol chuckled,\u00a0\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Maria touched Carol\u2019s cheek and gave it a quick once over.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s going to take some getting used to,\u201d Maria said before betting her lip.\u00a0</p><p>Carol caught the hint and slyly grinned.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d she said before capturing Maria\u2019s lips again.<br></p><p>The kiss grew more heated as Carol\u2019s hand went to Maria\u2019s thigh and Maria\u2019s went to Carol\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cC-Carol, Carol, baby\u2013look at me,\u201d Maria said.<br></p><p>Carol pulled away, eyes screwed shut before opening them again.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI-I need you,\u201d Carol whispered.<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got time, OK?\u201d<br></p><p>Carol nodded and threw her arms around Maria again.\u00a0</p></p>",

Carol Danvers x Talos, Platonic! Carol Danvers x Peter Parker, Platonic! Carol Danvers x Nick Fury</p><p>Summary: (SPOILER WARNING) After Carol returns to Earth she finds out that both Maria and Monica were lost in the snap. She and the other Avengers successfully kill Thanos, but Carol goes overboard in a fit of rage. She manages to calm down, going into space to help out those who were affected by the snap. She now helps planets whenever she can, while drowning herself in her own sorrows and self pity. Abruptly, the Avengers need her help with Thanos from another timeline and she realizes that they reversed the snap, giving her a chance to see her lover and daughter again.\u00a0</p><p>Word Count: 1,923</p><p>Writer\u2019s Note: Lot\u2019s of angst, a sad Carol but there will be fluff too :). It\u2019s a bit disjointed, but we all needed this in Endgame people I hope I delivered.\u00a0</p><hr>[[MORE]]<p>Carol glances down at the grass as she watches Tony and Pepper embrace. She would have flown through the galaxy, battling the stars, Kree and rogues all over again just to take Maria in her arms. But, all she came home to was dust, ash and a burnt pan where she assumed Maria was cooking. Tears escaped her, along with the glow of her hands that can with the frustration and anger she felt. She grabbed Maria\u2019s cellphone, calling Monica, yet she didn\u2019t answer. Her boyfriend, Tom picked up, frantic about Monica crumbling to dust in front of him. Carol let the anger consume her wholly, firing a photon blast through the ceiling of Maria\u2019s kitchen before leaping into the air with a bone curdling scream.\u00a0</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have me,\u201d Carol says to the Avengers numbly.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cLook, new girl,\u201d Rhodey starts,\u00a0\u201cwe\u2019re all about that superhero life but what-\u201d<br></p><p>Carol cut him off.</p><p>\u201cYou think I wanted to be out there! Away from my family while they disappeared? I\u2019m getting that son of a bitch whether you\u2019re with me or not.\u201d<br></p><p>Steve\u2019s jaw tightens but he nods.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, let\u2019s get the son of a bitch,\u201d he agreed.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2026</p><p>They caught Thanos alone. He was cooking something when Carol busted through his hut. All fire, hardly waiting for the avengers to catch up with her. A few photon blasts knocked him to the floor and Carol was on him again, arms firmly around his neck. Steve, Rhodey, Natasha, and Thor arrive.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhere are the stones?\u201d Steve asked.<br></p><p>Carol\u2019s grip on Thanos tightened, nearly strangling him to death.</p><p>\u201cAnswer. Him,\u201d she growled.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cGone- I-I destroyed them,\u201d Thanos said,\u00a0\u201ci-if y-you\u2019re here now then, I was successful-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnit!\u201d Carol roared.<br></p><p>It happened quickly. Thor tried to rush in first, eyes glowing blue with the lightning of Stormbreaker around him. Carol\u2019s move was swift, snapping Thanos\u2019 neck before Thor could reach. She let the titan\u2019s lifeless body drop, as Thor chopped off his head.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe fuck was that!\u201d Rhodey shouted.<br></p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s better that way,\u201d Carol said bluntly,\u00a0\u201cI avenged our family, friends, half of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol,\u201d Steve started.<br></p><p>Carol didn\u2019t listen as she flew back into the air.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Talos found Carol in a bar on planet Krylor, drowning herself in the sorrows of whatever fine drinks she could get her hands on. He cringed when he found her, hunched over the bar with a friend, in silver armor, Brunnhilde.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTo the new Queen of New Asguard!\u201d Carol beams as she downs her drink in one gulp.\u00a0</p><p>Brunnhilde gives Captain Marvel a small smile.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him,\u201d she says,\u00a0\u201call he does is drink and play\u2013 what are those things you mortals use to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVideo Games,\u201d Carol bellows.</p><p>She finally notices Talos glaring at her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIf you needed me you could have\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaged you. You\u2019re always in between planets, even got a new hair cut,\u201d Talos says as he sits next to Carol.</p><p>Carol runs a quick hand through her now short hair.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI had that hair for over twenty five years, it got in the way and I needed a change,\u201d she says.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Talos says before looking to Brunnhilde,\u00a0\u201cyou\u2019re in company of a Queen, eh?\u201d</p><p>Carol nods,\u00a0\u201cTalos, Brunnhilde. My best friend, saved him back in\u00a0\u201895. Brunnhilde, Queen of New Asguard, met her back\u2013\u201d</p><p>Carol cut herself off, staring down at the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFive years ago,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>Talos glares between the two women. Brunnhilde takes the hint and rises from the bar.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, New Asguard isn\u2019t going to govern itself,\u201d she says.</p><p>Before Brunnhilde leaves she puts a hand on Talos\u2019 shoulder.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d<br></p><p>Talos gives her a sharp nod before stalking out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSeriously, is everyone all right?\u201d Carol asks.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re hanging in there Carol, better than we were a few years ago. Thanks to you,\u201d Talos says.<br></p><p>Carol shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I can do now. Krylor still needs supplies\u2013 I\u2019m so close to finding more harvests for them. I need to.\u201d<br></p><p>She rises, but Talos stops her.</p><p>\u201cCarol. Breathe,\u201d he instructs.\u00a0<br></p><p>Carol gives him a hard look and sits back down, twirling the drink in her cup around.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou lied you know,\u201d he says,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not your best friend.\u201d<br></p><p>Carol scoffs,\u00a0\u201cjust take the complement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know where I\u2019m getting at,\u201d he banters,\u00a0\u201cremember when I went through that head of yours? Fogged up memories of flying aircrafts, cart racing and long karaoke nights with\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Carol warns, cutting Talos off.\u00a0<br></p><p>Talos purses his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to talk about her eventually,\u201d he suggests,\u00a0\u201cmy wife and daughter miss them too-\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cTalos,\u201d Carol says, voice teetering on the edge of cracking,\u00a0\u201cPlease all I can think about is\u2013\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>Carol cuts herself off with a silent sob. She puts a hand on her face and exhales.</p><p>\u201cSay it, tell me,\u201d Talos whispers.\u00a0<br></p><p>Carol chuckles, wiping her damp and red eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making me do this?\u201d she asks.<br></p><p>Talos\u2019 eyes soften as he squeezes Carol\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou may be the strongest I\u2019ve ever known Carol, but you\u2019re still human. Still flesh and bone, you don\u2019t need to hold your emotions in anymore. I thought you got Yon-Rogg out of your head already?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI thought I did, but I could never stop thinking about them. I loved Maria, fuck I still do but\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Carol cut herself off again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Talos urges,\u00a0\u201cwhat are you thinking?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI have this dream of seeing them again,\u201d Carol reflects,\u00a0\u201cGod, Lieutenant Trouble\u2019s really grown now, I didn\u2019t even get to formally meet her boyfriend yet\u2013 and Maria\u2013 I just want her in my arms again. I want to be home with her again.\u201d\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cWill you ever go back?\u201d Talos asks,\u00a0\u201cto Earth, I mean just as a temporary stay?\u201d<br></p><p>Carol shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that Talos, the Avengers have Earth covered and I have the rest of the galaxy there\u2019s no need to\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Carol gets cut off by the beeping of her phone, Natasha lent her one when she last visited Earth. Her eyes widened as she took it out.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI have to get to Earth, now,\u201d she says.<br></p><p>Talos is up with her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Carol,\u201d he says.<br></p><p>She doesn\u2019t need it, they both know that. But, Carol accepts it anyway and embraces Talos tightly.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Talos.\u201d<br></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Carol went binary in a millisecond while crashing through Thanos\u2019 warships. She surveyed the battlefield, looking for this Thanos from another timeline.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cDanvers, we could use an assist,\u201d Steve says.\u00a0</p><p>Carol nods, swooping down and spotting Spiderman, clutching onto the gauntlet for dear life.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHi there, I-I\u2019m Peter Parker,\u201d he croaks.<br></p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes softened for a moment. Here was this kid in the middle of a battlefield, bruised and afraid. God, he reminded her of Monica when she fell off of her bike years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHey Peter Parker, got something for me?\u201d she asks.<br></p><p>Peter gets up and hands the gauntlet off to Carol, eyeing her in a mixture of admiration and concern.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cum, uh ms\u2013what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>Carol grinned at him as she took the gauntlet and tucked it under her arm.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d She declares.<br></p><p>Peter frowns,\u00a0\u201cah, of course you used the fake name\u2013 Cap, how are you gonna get through that alone?\u201d</p><p>Carol turns toward the battle field, all of Thanos\u2019 army waiting and Thanos himself.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell, Peter\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got help,\u201d a voice says.<br></p><p>Carol turns as the other heroines joined her.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d Okoye says.</p><p>Carol nods and flies forward, eyes glows as she pushes through.\u00a0</p><p>Thanos collides with her, the gauntlet flying from her grip as Carol recovers slightly. The titan goes for it, but she stops him, gripping his arms tightly in an act to subdue him. Thanos cringes and headbutts her. Carol doesn\u2019t flinch before aiming to knock Thanos across the field.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCaptain Marvel look ou\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Peter\u2019s plea didn\u2019t get to Carol in time as Thanos peeled the power stone from his gauntlet, using it against her.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u201cVel\u2013Captain Marvel,\u201d Peter pleas, shaking Carol helplessly.</p><p>Carol hops up, taking notice of Peter. His eyes were red, and face tear stained.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cParker, what happened,\u201d Carol demanded, softly, yet firmly.<br></p><p>\u201cM-Mr Stark he\u2013 he used the stones h-he\u2019s\u2013\u201d<br></p><p>Carol\u2019s face grew white with shock and pain. Her fists clenched. She could have saved Stark again, but she was reckless. Again she couldn\u2019t keep the ones she cared for safe. She watches Peter break down in sobs. She\u2019s seen this before. Monica always ran to her while growing up, searching for her mother\u2019s comfort. She does the only think she knows how to do in this situation. She brought Peter into her arms, rubbing his back and soothing him as he cried into her chest.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Carol watched from Stark\u2019s porch as the eulogy ended. She kept her hands clasped together to keep them from trembling.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t lie to me, Fury,\u201d she growled.<br></p><p>Nick walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here aren\u2019t I,\u201d he said in a matter of fact fashion,\u00a0\u201ceverybody Thanos snapped from existence has returned.\u201d<br></p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes glossed as the tears rose up again. She put her fist against her mouth to keep her composure.</p><p>\u201cF-Fury\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo see her,\u201d he said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d want some explaining, especially with that haircut.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughs and wipes her tears.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Fury,\u201d she said.\u00a0</p><p>Nick shrugged and gasped when Carol pulled him into her arms. He returned it fully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnytime Avenger, we could road trip for old times\u2013\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Carol shot up into the air.</p><p>\u201cSorry Fury, but I\u2019ve been dreaming of this moment for five years,\u201d Carol shouted before zipping off.\u00a0<br></p><p>\u2026</p><p>Carol landed awkwardly, her black suit a little scorched and tattered from the trip, but she didn\u2019t care. Maria\u2019s house was in fine condition, even the hole Carol blew in the roof five years prior was gone. The door swung open and there she was, Maria Rambeau. Her fellow pilot, partner, best friend, lover. Her home.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cC-Carol\u2013 oh God\u2013\u201d Maria cried.</p><p>Carol ran up to her, taking the woman up into her arms in a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cI-It\u2019s you, I missed your hugs,\u201d Carol whispered into Maria\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cCarol, I\u2013 I thought you were\u2013\u201d</p><p>Maria broke down as Carol pulled back to see her face. Her hair got longer, now coming down past her neck. Carol admired the muscle in her lover\u2019s arms as well, noticing how tight she held on.

It&rsquo;s a bit disjointed, but we all needed this in Endgame people I hope I delivered.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>Carol glances down at the grass as she watches Tony and Pepper embrace. She would have flown through the galaxy, battling the stars, Kree and rogues all over again just to take Maria in her arms. But, all she came home to was dust, ash and a burnt pan where she assumed Maria was cooking. Tears escaped her, along with the glow of her hands that can with the frustration and anger she felt. She grabbed Maria&rsquo;s cellphone, calling Monica, yet she didn&rsquo;t answer. Her boyfriend, Tom picked up, frantic about Monica crumbling to dust in front of him. Carol let the anger consume her wholly, firing a photon blast through the ceiling of Maria&rsquo;s kitchen before leaping into the air with a bone curdling scream.&nbsp;</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have me,&rdquo; Carol says to the Avengers numbly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Look, new girl,&rdquo; Rhodey starts,&nbsp;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re all about that superhero life but what-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol cut him off.</p><p>&ldquo;You think I wanted to be out there! Away from my family while they disappeared? I&rsquo;m getting that son of a bitch whether you&rsquo;re with me or not.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve&rsquo;s jaw tightens but he nods.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, let&rsquo;s get the son of a bitch,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>They caught Thanos alone. He was cooking something when Carol busted through his hut. All fire, hardly waiting for the avengers to catch up with her. A few photon blasts knocked him to the floor and Carol was on him again, arms firmly around his neck. Steve, Rhodey, Natasha, and Thor arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are the stones?&rdquo; Steve asked.<br /></p><p>Carol&rsquo;s grip on Thanos tightened, nearly strangling him to death.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer. Him,&rdquo; she growled.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gone- I-I destroyed them,&rdquo; Thanos said,&nbsp;&ldquo;i-if y-you&rsquo;re here now then, I was successful-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damnit!&rdquo; Carol roared.<br /></p><p>It happened quickly. Thor tried to rush in first, eyes glowing blue with the lightning of Stormbreaker around him. Carol&rsquo;s move was swift, snapping Thanos&rsquo; neck before Thor could reach. She let the titan&rsquo;s lifeless body drop, as Thor chopped off his head.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The fuck was that!&rdquo; Rhodey shouted.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better that way,&rdquo; Carol said bluntly,&nbsp;&ldquo;I avenged our family, friends, half of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Carol,&rdquo; Steve started.<br /></p><p>Carol didn&rsquo;t listen as she flew back into the air.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Talos found Carol in a bar on planet Krylor, drowning herself in the sorrows of whatever fine drinks she could get her hands on. He cringed when he found her, hunched over the bar with a friend, in silver armor, Brunnhilde.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;To the new Queen of New Asguard!&rdquo; Carol beams as she downs her drink in one gulp.&nbsp;</p><p>Brunnhilde gives Captain Marvel a small smile.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about him,&rdquo; she says,&nbsp;&ldquo;all he does is drink and play&ndash; what are those things you mortals use to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Video Games,&rdquo; Carol bellows.</p><p>She finally notices Talos glaring at her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;If you needed me you could have&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Paged you. You&rsquo;re always in between planets, even got a new hair cut,&rdquo; Talos says as he sits next to Carol.</p><p>Carol runs a quick hand through her now short hair.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I had that hair for over twenty five years, it got in the way and I needed a change,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; Talos says before looking to Brunnhilde,&nbsp;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re in company of a Queen, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol nods,&nbsp;&ldquo;Talos, Brunnhilde. My best friend, saved him back in&nbsp;&lsquo;95. Brunnhilde, Queen of New Asguard, met her back&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Carol cut herself off, staring down at the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Five years ago,&rdquo; she whispers.</p><p>Talos glares between the two women. Brunnhilde takes the hint and rises from the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, New Asguard isn&rsquo;t going to govern itself,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Before Brunnhilde leaves she puts a hand on Talos&rsquo; shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Talos gives her a sharp nod before stalking out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously, is everyone all right?&rdquo; Carol asks.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hanging in there Carol, better than we were a few years ago. Thanks to you,&rdquo; Talos says.<br /></p><p>Carol shrugs.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I can do now. Krylor still needs supplies&ndash; I&rsquo;m so close to finding more harvests for them. I need to.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>She rises, but Talos stops her.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol. Breathe,&rdquo; he instructs.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Carol gives him a hard look and sits back down, twirling the drink in her cup around.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You lied you know,&rdquo; he says,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your best friend.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol scoffs,&nbsp;&ldquo;just take the complement.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think you know where I&rsquo;m getting at,&rdquo; he banters,&nbsp;&ldquo;remember when I went through that head of yours? Fogged up memories of flying aircrafts, cart racing and long karaoke nights with&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Carol warns, cutting Talos off.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Talos purses his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to talk about her eventually,&rdquo; he suggests,&nbsp;&ldquo;my wife and daughter miss them too-&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Talos,&rdquo; Carol says, voice teetering on the edge of cracking,&nbsp;&ldquo;Please all I can think about is&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Carol cuts herself off with a silent sob. She puts a hand on her face and exhales.</p><p>&ldquo;Say it, tell me,&rdquo; Talos whispers.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Carol chuckles, wiping her damp and red eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are you making me do this?&rdquo; she asks.<br /></p><p>Talos&rsquo; eyes soften as he squeezes Carol&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;You may be the strongest I&rsquo;ve ever known Carol, but you&rsquo;re still human. Still flesh and bone, you don&rsquo;t need to hold your emotions in anymore. I thought you got Yon-Rogg out of your head already?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I thought I did, but I could never stop thinking about them. I loved Maria, fuck I still do but&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol cut herself off again.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Talos urges,&nbsp;&ldquo;what are you thinking?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I have this dream of seeing them again,&rdquo; Carol reflects,&nbsp;&ldquo;God, Lieutenant Trouble&rsquo;s really grown now, I didn&rsquo;t even get to formally meet her boyfriend yet&ndash; and Maria&ndash; I just want her in my arms again. I want to be home with her again.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Will you ever go back?&rdquo; Talos asks,&nbsp;&ldquo;to Earth, I mean just as a temporary stay?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol shakes her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt that Talos, the Avengers have Earth covered and I have the rest of the galaxy there&rsquo;s no need to&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol gets cut off by the beeping of her phone, Natasha lent her one when she last visited Earth. Her eyes widened as she took it out.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I have to get to Earth, now,&rdquo; she says.<br /></p><p>Talos is up with her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Be careful, Carol,&rdquo; he says.<br /></p><p>She doesn&rsquo;t need it, they both know that. But, Carol accepts it anyway and embraces Talos tightly.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Talos.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Carol went binary in a millisecond while crashing through Thanos&rsquo; warships. She surveyed the battlefield, looking for this Thanos from another timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Danvers, we could use an assist,&rdquo; Steve says.&nbsp;</p><p>Carol nods, swooping down and spotting Spiderman, clutching onto the gauntlet for dear life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hi there, I-I&rsquo;m Peter Parker,&rdquo; he croaks.<br /></p><p>Carol&rsquo;s eyes softened for a moment. Here was this kid in the middle of a battlefield, bruised and afraid. God, he reminded her of Monica when she fell off of her bike years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Peter Parker, got something for me?&rdquo; she asks.<br /></p><p>Peter gets up and hands the gauntlet off to Carol, eyeing her in a mixture of admiration and concern.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;um, uh ms&ndash;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol grinned at him as she took the gauntlet and tucked it under her arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Captain Marvel,&rdquo; She declares.<br /></p><p>Peter frowns,&nbsp;&ldquo;ah, of course you used the fake name&ndash; Cap, how are you gonna get through that alone?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol turns toward the battle field, all of Thanos&rsquo; army waiting and Thanos himself.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Peter&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got help,&rdquo; a voice says.<br /></p><p>Carol turns as the other heroines joined her.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Go ahead, we&rsquo;ve got your back,&rdquo; Okoye says.</p><p>Carol nods and flies forward, eyes glows as she pushes through.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanos collides with her, the gauntlet flying from her grip as Carol recovers slightly. The titan goes for it, but she stops him, gripping his arms tightly in an act to subdue him. Thanos cringes and headbutts her. Carol doesn&rsquo;t flinch before aiming to knock Thanos across the field.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Captain Marvel look ou&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Peter&rsquo;s plea didn&rsquo;t get to Carol in time as Thanos peeled the power stone from his gauntlet, using it against her.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Vel&ndash;Captain Marvel,&rdquo; Peter pleas, shaking Carol helplessly.</p><p>Carol hops up, taking notice of Peter. His eyes were red, and face tear stained.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Parker, what happened,&rdquo; Carol demanded, softly, yet firmly.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;M-Mr Stark he&ndash; he used the stones h-he&rsquo;s&ndash;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol&rsquo;s face grew white with shock and pain. Her fists clenched. She could have saved Stark again, but she was reckless. Again she couldn&rsquo;t keep the ones she cared for safe. She watches Peter break down in sobs. She&rsquo;s seen this before. Monica always ran to her while growing up, searching for her mother&rsquo;s comfort. She does the only think she knows how to do in this situation. She brought Peter into her arms, rubbing his back and soothing him as he cried into her chest.</p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Carol watched from Stark&rsquo;s porch as the eulogy ended. She kept her hands clasped together to keep them from trembling.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;D-Don&rsquo;t lie to me, Fury,&rdquo; she growled.<br /></p><p>Nick walked over to her.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here aren&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; he said in a matter of fact fashion,&nbsp;&ldquo;everybody Thanos snapped from existence has returned.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol&rsquo;s eyes glossed as the tears rose up again. She put her fist against her mouth to keep her composure.</p><p>&ldquo;F-Fury&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go see her,&rdquo; he said,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d want some explaining, especially with that haircut.&rdquo;</p><p>Carol laughs and wipes her tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Fury,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick shrugged and gasped when Carol pulled him into her arms. He returned it fully.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Anytime Avenger, we could road trip for old times&ndash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Carol shot up into the air.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Fury, but I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of this moment for five years,&rdquo; Carol shouted before zipping off.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&hellip;</p><p>Carol landed awkwardly, her black suit a little scorched and tattered from the trip, but she didn&rsquo;t care. Maria&rsquo;s house was in fine condition, even the hole Carol blew in the roof five years prior was gone. The door swung open and there she was, Maria Rambeau. Her fellow pilot, partner, best friend, lover. Her home.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;C-Carol&ndash; oh God&ndash;&rdquo; Maria cried.</p><p>Carol ran up to her, taking the woman up into her arms in a warm embrace.</p><p>&ldquo;I-It&rsquo;s you, I missed your hugs,&rdquo; Carol whispered into Maria&rsquo;s neck.</p><p>&ldquo;Carol, I&ndash; I thought you were&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>Maria broke down as Carol pulled back to see her face. Her hair got longer, now coming down past her neck. Carol admired the muscle in her lover&rsquo;s arms as well, noticing how tight she held on. She almost came to tears too, but she had to be strong now. For the both of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now,&rdquo; she declared,&nbsp;&ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t leave and let anything like that happened again.&rdquo;</p><p>Maria put on a weak smile and that was all it took for Carol to kiss her. Her hands found themselves around Maria&rsquo;s waist, while Maria ran her hands through Carol&rsquo;s now short hair.&nbsp;</p><p>Maria pulled back breathlessly and gazed fondly into Carol&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Haircut?&rdquo;</p><p>Carol chuckled,&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p><p>Maria touched Carol&rsquo;s cheek and gave it a quick once over.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I do, but it&rsquo;s going to take some getting used to,&rdquo; Maria said before betting her lip.&nbsp;</p><p>Carol caught the hint and slyly grinned.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; she said before capturing Maria&rsquo;s lips again.<br /></p><p>The kiss grew more heated as Carol&rsquo;s hand went to Maria&rsquo;s thigh and Maria&rsquo;s went to Carol&rsquo;s chest.</p><p>&ldquo;C-Carol, Carol, baby&ndash;look at me,&rdquo; Maria said.<br /></p><p>Carol pulled away, eyes screwed shut before opening them again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I-I need you,&rdquo; Carol whispered.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got time, OK?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Carol nodded and threw her arms around Maria again.&nbsp;</p></p>",

You weren\u2019t complaining and you promised that you were going to try to play pretend along with everybody so that you could return to your normal life, whatever your normal life was like five years ago.</p><p>Kylee, your best friend, invited you to come to the carnival with her boyfriend, Xavier and you agreed, hoping you would be reminded of the good old times you spent with Kylee. You three went on a couple rides together and the roller coasters were able to fit all of you three so splitting up the group wasn\u2019t a problem. After going on a couple rides, Kylee wanted to ride the Ferris wheel since she wanted to watch the romantic sunset with Xavier, claiming that it would be an amazing view since the Ferris wheel overlooked a glossy lake. </p><p>Before you got in line for the Ferris wheel, you got cotton candy and Kylee watched Xavier attempt to win a stuffed animal for her by throwing darts at balloons. Afterward, you guys went to board the Ferris wheel and to your disappointment, the Ferris wheel booths could only hold two people at a time so you allowed Kylee to go with Xavier. When you boarded onto the booth, the ride operator told you that you weren\u2019t allowed to be alone in your booth and a girl boarded the booth, sitting next to you. </p><p>At first, you felt a bit uncomfortable about being on a ride with a stranger but the girl was actually quite pretty. She wore a crocodile green jacket with jean shorts with a blue and red t-shirt. Her hair was cut in a short pixie bob cut and she radiated big lesbian energy. For some reason, she looked vaguely familiar but you couldn\u2019t recall where you saw her before. </p><p>\u201cYour shirt is really patriotic,\u201d You blurted out by accident as the ride started, the booth slowly ascending. The girl turned towards you, appearing to be pleasantly surprised as she tugged at the ends of her jacket.</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t notice that! I guess I\u2019m just used to wearing these colors. I\u2019m Carol by the way,\u201d Carol stuck out a hand, her smile shining brighter than the light of the sun and stars combined. You shook her hand, smiling back as the panic mode in your brain turned on, reminding you that you hadn\u2019t talked with a pretty girl in ages. The last time you flirted with somebody, you stumbled over your words and ended up ruining the moment so you silently promised yourself that you were going to stay calm during this interaction.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m Y/n! Um, how\u2019s your day going?\u201d You attempted to start a conversation to ease the slowly eroding tension since you knew that silence with strangers always made you uncomfortable. As the ride briefly stopped to let some more people on, the booth rocked slightly, causing a piece of Carol\u2019s hair to fall on her forehead. She casually pushed the hair back and you tried not to seem like that simple gesture stole your oxygen supply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been exploring the town for a bit. I haven\u2019t been here in a while because of traveling,\u201d Carol stared off into the distance, taking in the view of the town as she wistfully replied.</p><p>\u201cTo where? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Carol turned back to face you again, her lips curling into another small smile as you asked the question. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say somewhere very far from here. What are you here for?\u201d Her eyes flashed with a spark of something undetectable, possibly mischief or affection (although there is not much of a difference between those two), as she asked. </p><p>\u201cA friend invited me to come with her and her boyfriend. I wish this was a double date but as you can probably tell, I don\u2019t have a partner to ride romantic Ferris wheel rides with,\u201d You joked, hoping that she enjoyed sarcastic humor and to your delight, your remark earned a giggle from her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, same here. My girlfriend broke up with me because I was \u2018too liberal\u2019 for her,\u201d Carol explained, using air quotes to emphasize the absurdity of the accusation and rolled her eyes as she continued to explain. \u201cAll I did was try to advocate for equal rights but I guess she didn\u2019t care and thought that equal rights don\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOuch, that sucks big time,\u201d You offered a sympathetic remark just as the Ferris wheel abruptly halted to a stop. Your booth was at the very top of the Ferris wheel and it was swinging back and forth due to the sudden stop. You glanced down at the ground to see the operator pushing buttons and pulling levers at the operating station, clearly panicking.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess this means we\u2019re stuck here together\u201d You commented, not particularly anxious about being stuck in a Ferris wheel with a very attractive and sweet girl. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Hey, can I have some of that cotton candy? It looks delicious,\u201d Carol glanced at the cotton candy then looking up at you, an innocent, child-like look in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d You grabbed a tuft of cotton candy from the cone of cotton candy in your hand and handed it to Carol. Carol excitedly put the cotton candy in her mouth and ate it, smiling the whole time. </p><p>\u201cMm, this is amazing! I think this is the best cotton candy I\u2019ve ever had in my life!\u201d Carol commented, her smile widened as the sweetness of the cotton candy registering in her taste buds. </p><p>\u201cIt really is amazing,\u201d You agreed, staring off into the distance and silently admiring the view. The sun was slowly sinking into the horizon and the sunset reflected into the smooth surface of the water\u2019s lake. The view was as breathtaking as Kylee promised and you breathlessly thought aloud, \u201cThe view is really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite honestly, I think you\u2019re prettier than the sunset,\u201d Carol quipped casually and then she noticed your intense blush spreading across your cheeks. Instinctively, she brought her hands up to her mouth and gasped, \u201cDid I just say that out loud? Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I know you\u2019re single and I respect that and I\u2019m so sorry I said that. It totally just slipped from my mouth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay! Don\u2019t worry about it. And actually, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2018the one\u2019 for a while but you know, since people dissolved and came back after five years, it\u2019s hard to find somebody among all this chaos,\u201d You lightheartedly replied, trying to laugh off the slightly harrowing topic you accidentally brought up. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah I\u2019m sorry. These past few years have been difficult,\u201d Carol admitted, seeming to be a little lost in her memories of the past few years. You noticed how uncomfortable how quickly Carol\u2019s demeanor changed at the mention of the dusting. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s really okay. I, uh, think you\u2019re really pretty too,\u201d You bashfully flirted, feeling the blush returning to your face. Carol\u2019s beautiful smile returned as she beamed at your remark.</p><p>\u201cIf we ever get off this thing, do you maybe want to ride the carousel or something together? I would love to get to know you better. You\u2019re a really cool person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! But if we\u2019re stuck up here forever, you better not finish all our food supply within the next twenty-two minutes,\u201d You dramatically shielded your cotton candy from Carol, gaining a laugh from her. </p><p>\u201cNo worries. Even if I do finish our food supply, I can always scale the side of this giant wheel with you in my arms and safely land on the ground,\u201d Carol retorted, a dead serious expression on her face that broke into delight when you broke out in wheezing laughter. </p><p>\u201cSound romantic,\u201d You responded, grinning as Carol laughed along with you. Abruptly, the booth lurched forward as the Ferris wheel began working again. Your hand accidentally landed onto Carol\u2019s as you almost crashed into her. You quickly apologized and you two sat silently in the booth, glancing shyly at each other as the booth reached the bottom of the Ferris wheel. </p><p>As you got off of the Ferris wheel, you saw Kylee and she quickly ran over to you, \u201cYou\u2019re okay! I was worried about you! That was really scary. Xavier and I are going to get some hot dogs to calm down before going on any other rides. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>You glanced over at Carol, who was expectantly waiting for you by the exit of the Ferris wheel and answered, \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll pass. I promised somebody a carousel ride.\u201d </p><p>~</p><p>please feel free to send requests! check out my marvel page on my blog for more marvel fics!</p>",

I wish this was a double date but as you can probably tell, I don\u2019t have a partner to ride romantic Ferris wheel rides with,\u201d You joked, hoping that she enjoyed sarcastic humor and to your delight, your remark earned a giggle from her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, same here. My girlfriend broke up with me because I was \u2018too liberal\u2019 for her,\u201d Carol explained, using air quotes to emphasize the absurdity of the accusation and rolled her eyes as she continued to explain. \u201cAll I did was try to advocate for equal rights but I guess she didn\u2019t care and thought that equal rights don\u2019t matter.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOuch, that sucks big time,\u201d You offered a sympathetic remark just as the Ferris wheel abruptly halted to a stop. Your booth was at the very top of the Ferris wheel and it was swinging back and forth due to the sudden stop. You glanced down at the ground to see the operator pushing buttons and pulling levers at the operating station, clearly panicking.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess this means we\u2019re stuck here together\u201d You commented, not particularly anxious about being stuck in a Ferris wheel with a very attractive and sweet girl. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Hey, can I have some of that cotton candy? It looks delicious,\u201d Carol glanced at the cotton candy then looking up at you, an innocent, child-like look in her eyes. </p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d You grabbed a tuft of cotton candy from the cone of cotton candy in your hand and handed it to Carol. Carol excitedly put the cotton candy in her mouth and ate it, smiling the whole time. </p><p>\u201cMm, this is amazing! I think this is the best cotton candy I\u2019ve ever had in my life!\u201d Carol commented, her smile widened as the sweetness of the cotton candy registering in her taste buds. </p><p>\u201cIt really is amazing,\u201d You agreed, staring off into the distance and silently admiring the view. The sun was slowly sinking into the horizon and the sunset reflected into the smooth surface of the water\u2019s lake. The view was as breathtaking as Kylee promised and you breathlessly thought aloud, \u201cThe view is really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite honestly, I think you\u2019re prettier than the sunset,\u201d Carol quipped casually and then she noticed your intense blush spreading across your cheeks. Instinctively, she brought her hands up to her mouth and gasped, \u201cDid I just say that out loud? Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I know you\u2019re single and I respect that and I\u2019m so sorry I said that. It totally just slipped from my mouth.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay! Don\u2019t worry about it. And actually, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2018the one\u2019 for a while but you know, since people dissolved and came back after five years, it\u2019s hard to find somebody among all this chaos,\u201d You lightheartedly replied, trying to laugh off the slightly harrowing topic you accidentally brought up. </p><p>\u201cOh, yeah I\u2019m sorry. These past few years have been difficult,\u201d Carol admitted, seeming to be a little lost in her memories of the past few years. You noticed how uncomfortable how quickly Carol\u2019s demeanor changed at the mention of the dusting. </p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s really okay. I, uh, think you\u2019re really pretty too,\u201d You bashfully flirted, feeling the blush returning to your face. Carol\u2019s beautiful smile returned as she beamed at your remark.</p><p>\u201cIf we ever get off this thing, do you maybe want to ride the carousel or something together? I would love to get to know you better. You\u2019re a really cool person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! But if we\u2019re stuck up here forever, you better not finish all our food supply within the next twenty-two minutes,\u201d You dramatically shielded your cotton candy from Carol, gaining a laugh from her. </p><p>\u201cNo worries. Even if I do finish our food supply, I can always scale the side of this giant wheel with you in my arms and safely land on the ground,\u201d Carol retorted, a dead serious expression on her face that broke into delight when you broke out in wheezing laughter. </p><p>\u201cSound romantic,\u201d You responded, grinning as Carol laughed along with you. Abruptly, the booth lurched forward as the Ferris wheel began working again. Your hand accidentally landed onto Carol\u2019s as you almost crashed into her. You quickly apologized and you two sat silently in the booth, glancing shyly at each other as the booth reached the bottom of the Ferris wheel. </p><p>As you got off of the Ferris wheel, you saw Kylee and she quickly ran over to you, \u201cYou\u2019re okay! I was worried about you! That was really scary. Xavier and I are going to get some hot dogs to calm down before going on any other rides. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>You glanced over at Carol, who was expectantly waiting for you by the exit of the Ferris wheel and answered, \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll pass. I promised somebody a carousel ride.\u201d </p><p>~</p><p>please feel free to send requests! check out my marvel page on my blog for more marvel fics!</p></p>",

You weren\u2019t complaining and you promised that you were going to try to play pretend along with everybody so that you could return to your normal life, whatever your normal life was like five years ago.</p><p>Kylee, your best friend, invited you to come to the carnival with her boyfriend, Xavier and you agreed, hoping you would be reminded of the good old times you spent with Kylee. You three went on a couple rides together and the roller coasters were able to fit all of you three so splitting up the group wasn\u2019t a problem. After going on a couple rides, Kylee wanted to ride the Ferris wheel since she wanted to watch the romantic sunset with Xavier, claiming that it would be an amazing view since the Ferris wheel overlooked a glossy lake. </p><p>Before you got in line for the Ferris wheel, you got cotton candy and Kylee watched Xavier attempt to win a stuffed animal for her by throwing darts at balloons. Afterward, you guys went to board the Ferris wheel and to your disappointment, the Ferris wheel booths could only hold two people at a time so you allowed Kylee to go with Xavier. When you boarded onto the booth, the ride operator told you that you weren\u2019t allowed to be alone in your booth and a girl boarded the booth, sitting next to you. </p><p>At first, you felt a bit uncomfortable about being on a ride with a stranger but the girl was actually quite pretty. She wore a crocodile green jacket with jean shorts with a blue and red t-shirt. Her hair was cut in a short pixie bob cut and she radiated big lesbian energy. For some reason, she looked vaguely familiar but you couldn\u2019t recall where you saw her before. </p><p>\u201cYour shirt is really patriotic,\u201d You blurted out by accident as the ride started, the booth slowly ascending. The girl turned towards you, appearing to be pleasantly surprised as she tugged at the ends of her jacket.</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t notice that! I guess I\u2019m just used to wearing these colors. I\u2019m Carol by the way,\u201d Carol stuck out a hand, her smile shining brighter than the light of the sun and stars combined. You shook her hand, smiling back as the panic mode in your brain turned on, reminding you that you hadn\u2019t talked with a pretty girl in ages. The last time you flirted with somebody, you stumbled over your words and ended up ruining the moment so you silently promised yourself that you were going to stay calm during this interaction.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m Y/n! Um, how\u2019s your day going?\u201d You attempted to start a conversation to ease the slowly eroding tension since you knew that silence with strangers always made you uncomfortable. As the ride briefly stopped to let some more people on, the booth rocked slightly, causing a piece of Carol\u2019s hair to fall on her forehead. She casually pushed the hair back and you tried not to seem like that simple gesture stole your oxygen supply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been exploring the town for a bit. I haven\u2019t been here in a while because of traveling,\u201d Carol stared off into the distance, taking in the view of the town as she wistfully replied.</p><p>\u201cTo where? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d Carol turned back to face you again, her lips curling into another small smile as you asked the question. </p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say somewhere very far from here.
