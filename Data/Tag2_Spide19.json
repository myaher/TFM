                "content": "<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; Peter helped you sit down - on the roof of a hospital, of all places - and immediately ripped his mask off, kneeling next to you.<br /></p><p>You groaned in pain, reaching down and grabbing hold of your ankle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; you told him, face scrunching up in slight pain for a moment. Peter bit his lip nervously.</p><p>&ldquo;Karen, call Mister Stark.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Calling Mister Stark.&rdquo;</p><p>The beeping of the phone ringing filled the empty silence around you, and, for once, you couldn&rsquo;t be mad at Peter for calling Tony. Usually, if ever you accompanied Peter on one of his patrols and you winded up getting injured, you&rsquo;d beg for him not to call for fear of the man never letting you out again. Nevertheless, you figured now was as good a time as any to let him know how badly you&rsquo;d messed up your ankle.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Pete. Everything alright?</i>&rdquo; You looked up as Tony&rsquo;s voice sounded from Peter&rsquo;s suit. The kid looked as nervous as he could be, if you were being honest, which would have been amusing were you not in agonising pain.</p><p>&ldquo;Uh, I-I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Peter said, and you shook your head.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s <i>fine</i>, Tony. I just busted up my ankle, is all.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>The both of you heard a dry chuckle on the other end of the phone and what sounded like a bit of shuffling round.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;&rsquo;Is all&rsquo;,&rdquo;</i> he replied, sarcasm dripping from his voice.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you manage that?&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; Peter piped up.&nbsp;&ldquo;I told her she could make the jump from one building to the other, but she almost fell and I had to swing down to catch her&hellip;&rdquo; He winced at Tony&rsquo;s sigh.<br /></p><p><i>&ldquo;Stay on the </i>ground<i>, kids. Isn&rsquo;t that what I said?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>Peter moved to assure him.&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, I just said-&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault, yeah, I know. Except, </i>I&rsquo;m <i>saying the blame lies with the </i>both <i>of you. Tell me, Y/N, how&rsquo;d you get on the roof in the first place? I&rsquo;m guessing Peter forced you up there, right?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>You rolled your eyes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony, I&rsquo;m in <i>pain</i>, here.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Yeah, and I&rsquo;m in the car and on my way. But, you&rsquo;re getting it once I find you. You can&rsquo;t endanger your life like this.&rdquo; </i>You could hear the scolding tone in his voice as both you and Peter glanced at each other, wincing.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Peter, have you got something to wrap her ankle with?&rdquo;</i></p><p>Peter stood to his feet, shuffling inside a pocket in his suit you didn&rsquo;t even know he had and pulling out a roll of bandages. You rose an eyebrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;What the hell, Pete?&rdquo;</p><p>Your best friend gave you a look.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, come <i>on</i>, Y/N; this isn&rsquo;t the first time something like this has happened. I come prepared on every patrol.&rdquo; He knelt back down next to you and sighed.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got bandages, Tony.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Right, okay. You know how to wrap her ankle with it?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;No, but I can try.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Pe</i>ter!&rdquo; you said indignantly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not letting some <i>novice </i>wrap my ankle!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You could practically <i>hear</i>Tony roll his eyes.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Just let him do it, Y/N. It&rsquo;s not difficult, and I&rsquo;ll be there soon, anyways.&rdquo;</i></p><p>You sighed, glancing at Peter before nodding.&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine, but be careful. It hurts.&rdquo; Peter offered a small smile before moving down to your feet and slowly working on taking off your shoe and sock and wrapping your ankle - which was all shades of purple and brown, now - in the bandage. Granted, it was a difficult process, and by the time he&rsquo;d finished it you had silent tears running down your cheeks, but he immediately went to hug you as soon as he&rsquo;d finished.</p><p><i>&ldquo;Everything done? You both alright? Y/N?&rdquo;</i><br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; you said quietly, a sniffle accompanying it.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Y/N,&rdquo; Peter said, leaning his head against yours.&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Pete.
