What are you\u2013 why\u2013 huh?&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Lovely to see you too, dear,&rdquo; my mum said, inviting herself into my flat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I blinked several times, shutting the door behind her. &ldquo;It has&hellip; how did you even know where I lived?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She took off her expensive-looking coat and I watched as her eyes scanned the room, searching for a place to hang it. She decided on hanging it on her arm, holding it to her chest, as if there was nowhere good enough for it. </p><!-- more --><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It wasn&rsquo;t very difficult,&ldquo; she said, a judgemental expression on her face, eyeballing my flat. &quot;No help from you, might I add. You&rsquo;ve never invited me over.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to come,&ldquo; I admitted, leading her to the kitchen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I motioned for her to take a seat on the stool as I put the kettle on, knowing she&rsquo;d want a cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You never asked, so how would you know?&rdquo; she countered, resting her hands on the countertop hesitantly. &ldquo;Besides, I didn&rsquo;t come here to make you feel bad\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Oh, that was just a plus&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;\u2013I came to invite you to my wedding,&rdquo; she finished, making me stop my actions for a moment. My back was to her, so I couldn&rsquo;t see her face, but I was taken aback myself and tried not to show it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re marrying Isaac?&ldquo; I asked, finally turning around, my face expressionless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I am,&rdquo; she said, a small smile on her lips. &ldquo;He proposed a few days ago.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and my mouth formed an &lsquo;O&rsquo; shape. I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I was feeling weird about this whole thing. It&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t like Isaac \u2013 he was a lovely man who cared about my mother. In fact, he was the only person who could set her down from her high horse and make her seem more human-like. It was just so random, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I thought it would be fitting, seeing as you&rsquo;re my only child, for you to be my maid of honour,&ldquo; she said, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard the kettle whistle and accepted the distraction, deciding to fill our mugs with water. I was adding the milk when she cleared her throat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s rude not to respond, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, making me roll my eyes. Same old mum.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Congratulations,&ldquo; I answered, turning around and setting a cup of tea before her. &quot;When&rsquo;s the wedding?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Next week,&ldquo; she said, making me raise my eyebrows with surprise. &quot;Being wealthy has its perks. We&rsquo;ve already planned most things. It&rsquo;s in Hawaii. A week long. I&rsquo;m hoping you can make it?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My jaw dropped. &ldquo;Hawaii?!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Yes, dear. I&rsquo;ve already got everything sorted out. Including your tickets. Will you come?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, but you said tickets as in more than one. Who are you expecting me to bring?&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I know you don&rsquo;t tell me much on our weekly phone calls, but I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re with someone,&rdquo; she said, sure of herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, actually I'm\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Bring them with you,&ldquo; she said sternly. &quot;I don&rsquo;t want you to show up\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Alone and embarrass all of your rich upper-class friends?&ldquo; I finished, holding my mug and smiling knowingly at my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t put words into my mouth, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, narrowing her gaze before wrapping her hands around her own mug. &ldquo;I just want everyone to know you&rsquo;re doing well. Even if it means bringing that blonde-headed girl with you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;What\u2013 Who are you talking about? What girl?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pointed a finger over her shoulder. &ldquo;The framed photo? Of you and that blonde? She&rsquo;s your girlfriend, right?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I almost choked on my tea. &ldquo;You mean Brie? She&rsquo;s not\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll try not to be too offended by the fact that you hid this from me,&ldquo; she interrupted, once again not listening to a word I was saying. &quot;It&rsquo;s very like you to not tell me anything important happening in your life\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Mum! That&rsquo;s completely\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;\u2013but I&rsquo;m happy for you, Y/N. And I&rsquo;m excited to meet her. I know I&rsquo;ll probably only be introduced at the actual wedding but\u2013&quot;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Mum, she&rsquo;s not\u2013!&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;\u2013I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you arranged a meeting before then,&rdquo; she finished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed through gritted teeth. This was one of the reasons she was so <i>infuriating </i>to me. She never listened to a word I said, instead choosing to listen to what she wanted. This was one of the reasons I distanced myself from her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re with someone,&ldquo; she added as an afterthought. &quot;I wasn&rsquo;t sure you would be, considering&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Considering what exactly?&ldquo; I asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, you&rsquo;ve not exactly achieved a lot, have you?&rdquo; she said knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m a school councillor and I help teenagers get through difficult times,&ldquo; I said proudly. &quot;I think I&rsquo;ve achieved quite a bit if it means making someone&rsquo;s day easier. It&rsquo;s a rewarding career.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stifled a smile. &ldquo;If you say so, Y/N&hellip; look, I know I don&rsquo;t say it much, but I&rsquo;m proud of you. Technically I haven&rsquo;t seen you both together, but to <i>know</i> that you&rsquo;re in a relationship is a good thing. I&rsquo;m excited to meet this 'Brie&rsquo; woman.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I paused, finding it odd to see her staring at me with a sense of pride. She suddenly chose to express her feelings when she thought I was in a relationship? I hated that I felt like that little girl I once was, trying her very hardest to make her mum proud. Because now I felt the need to do it again, even though I knew I didn&rsquo;t need to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Darling, I&rsquo;m home!&ldquo; Brie&rsquo;s familiar voice called through the flat, followed by the sound of the front door shutting and her laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that you shared flat with her,&rdquo; my mum noted, smiling over the rim of her cup before taking a sip. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I facepalmed at the sound of Brie&rsquo;s footsteps nearing us. It was a bit between us \u2013 pretending we were a married couple because we&rsquo;d been living together for two years now. Right now though, I could see how my mum thought otherwise&hellip;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, I have the funniest\u2013 oh! I&rsquo;m sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t aware we had company,&ldquo; Brie said upon entering the kitchen. A friendly smile was on her lips as she dropped her bag by the counter and stood by my side, opposite my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Brie, this is my&hellip; <i>mum</i>,&rdquo; I mumbled, gripping my mug. &ldquo;Mum, this is Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie gave my mum her perfectly angelic smile and outstretched her hand over the counter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Lovely to finally meet you, Brie,&ldquo; my mum said, and it was the first time I&rsquo;d seen her smile without it being because of something business-related or Isaac. She shook Brie&rsquo;s hand, saying, &quot;Y/N here never mentioned your existence, but it&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled, looping her arm through mine and pulling me close. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. It took me a while to dig basic facts out of this one when we first met. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, too, though, Miss Y/L/N. Y/N&rsquo;s actually mentioned you a few times, so it&rsquo;s nice to put a face to a name.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum seemed surprised at this, as she shot me a look. She looked back to Brie, smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Please, call me Y/M/N, Brie.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked between the two, the agitation I was feeling towards my mum slowly disappearing as I saw her looking genuinely happy and, dare I say it&hellip; proud? Was this finally a way to make her actually <i>see </i>me?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&rdquo;&hellip;Y/N will share the details with you but you <i>must </i>attend our wedding next week.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. &quot;Wow, really? I mean, we&rsquo;ve only just met and\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re important to Y/N, so you&rsquo;re now important to me,&ldquo; my mum cut her off, before standing up. I won&rsquo;t accept anything other than a yes.&rdquo; She was adamant, though her tone was lighthearted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie laughed. &ldquo;Okay, I guess that&rsquo;s a yes. Especially if it means I get to see this one in a dress.&rdquo; She nudged me playfully, making me smile a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Tickets are already taken care of,&ldquo; my mum said, reaching into her coat pocket before setting two sets of tickets on the counter. Brie looked to me with surprise. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say at this point. &quot;I must get going now, but thank you for the tea, Y/N,&rdquo; my mum said, finishing her last sip before standing up. She looked to me with a genuine smile and sense of pride, making me feel lighter. Was I actually impressing her? Just because I had a (what she thought to be) girlfriend? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Er, yeah, no problem, mum,&ldquo; I said, letting go of Brie and leading my mum to the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;It was a pleasure to meet you, too, Brie,&rdquo; my mum added as I opened the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Congratulations on your engagement, Y/M/N,&ldquo; Brie said, smiling. &quot;Thank you again, for inviting us.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum returned the smile, making me do a double take. She was actually <i>happy. </i>She stopped at the doorway, looking between us both, before nodding at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re a lovely couple,&ldquo; she complimented, and it was probably the third time in my life she&rsquo;d paid me a compliment. &quot;I can&rsquo;t wait for my friends to see you both.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled. &ldquo;What? Wait, d'you think\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thanks, mum,&ldquo; I interrupted Brie, instead intertwining our fingers for my mum to see. I looked to Brie, giving her a look. &quot;D'you want to say thank you, <i>darling</i>?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie seemed to understand, though I could sense her confusion. Nonetheless, she plastered a smile on her face and pulled me close, looking to my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said, flashing my mum her signature Brie smile, though her cheeks were now a little pink. &quot;And thank you for stopping by.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum pulled us both in for a brief hug, making me freeze up with shock. She wasn&rsquo;t the touchiest of people, so this was definitely a rarity. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;I think we should meet up before the wedding,&ldquo; she said when she pulled away. &quot;How would you girls like to come to dinner at mine? Tomorrow night? Y/N, you know the address.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was taken aback at her invite. She was thinking about <i>me</i>. Wanting to know <i>me</i>. What alternate universe was I on? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Sure thing, mum, we&rsquo;ll be there,&ldquo; I said to her. Was I that desperate for an ounce of my mum&rsquo;s attention that I&rsquo;d lie to her? I guess so. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Yeah, we&rsquo;ll see you then,&rdquo; Brie added, smiling, though I saw her spare me a confused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Perfect. I&rsquo;ll see you then.&ldquo; My mum gave me one last look over before turning to leave. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed the door behind her before releasing a breath, feeling the tension in my chest unknot. Same effect, as always. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Care to share what just happened, <i>sweetie</i>?&rdquo; Brie said in a teasing high-pitched voice, raising our intertwined hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;My mum happened,&ldquo; I groaned, going to the couch to flop onto it face-first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, why does your mum think we&rsquo;re dating? It now makes sense why she would suddenly invite me to Hawaii when I just met her, but yeah, I&rsquo;m a little lost still.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard Brie&rsquo;s voice get closer and I assumed she was sat on the chair beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Because she likes to think she has the perfect daughter when she doesn&rsquo;t,&ldquo; I said, my voice slightly muffled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed before sitting up, meeting Brie&rsquo;s concerned gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; she just came out of nowhere. She&rsquo;s never even been here. She&rsquo;s getting married and wants me to be the maid of honour so she can impress all of her rich snobby friends. And she thinks we&rsquo;re dating because she saw a photo of us and didn&rsquo;t listen to me when I tried to tell her we weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Well, you might want to tell her otherwise because she thinks we&rsquo;re going to her wedding&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled awkwardly. &quot;Maybe because we are&hellip;?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Oh, come on,&ldquo; I said, trying to sound convincing, &quot;it won&rsquo;t be bad! She already thinks we&rsquo;re together and I&rsquo;ve never seen her look so proud of me before. Did you know that was the first hug she&rsquo;s given me in three years?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie widened her eyes. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. &ldquo;She and I aren&rsquo;t very close&hellip; she cares too much about what other people think of her. Of me. I left as soon as I could afford to and have been fine ever since. We talk every now and then, but nothing meaningful&hellip; she&rsquo;s my mum, though, and I guess I want her to be proud of me. This is the first time she&rsquo;s been remotely interested in my life. She invited me to dinner tomorrow! She&rsquo;s never done that!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Y/N, that sucks and I&rsquo;m really sorry,&ldquo; Brie started, a frown on her lips, &quot;but this is crazy. We can&rsquo;t just be girlfriends to impress her. You can&rsquo;t lie to her.&rdquo; She avoided my eyes, her cheeks growing pink, making me wonder why she was suddenly so embarrassed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Oh, I can,&ldquo; I said, nodding my head. &quot;Look, it won&rsquo;t be long. Just her engagement party and the wedding and it&rsquo;s done. Plus it&rsquo;s in Hawaii, so it&rsquo;ll be like a holiday! I just want her to be proud of me. It won&rsquo;t be hard, I mean, we&rsquo;re already close and how many times have people thought we&rsquo;re a couple?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She quirked an eyebrow. &ldquo;Never?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;The mail man!&ldquo; I pointed out, a little unconvincingly. &quot;Remember? He thought we were girlfriends.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;He was also sent to prison for perving on the neighbours,&ldquo; she added, studying me curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waved my hand dismissively. &quot;Prison, shmison. Look, I&rsquo;ll love you forever if you do this one thing for me.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Oh, so you don&rsquo;t love me forever now?&ldquo; she asked teasingly, a smile tugging at her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;You know I do,&rdquo; I said, returning the smile. &ldquo;Come on. What could go wrong?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, watching me. I smiled hopefully, moving closer to her and resting my hands on hers. She sighed, rolling her eyes, as if to distract from her now red cheeks.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Fine, I&rsquo;ll do it,&ldquo; she gave in, making me grin and jump on her, pulling her in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0&quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you!&rdquo; I said, kissing her face several times. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She laughed, shoving me off her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, idiot. Now. I need the rundown on your mother. She&rsquo;s a&hellip; <i>unique</i> character.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded, a grin on my lips. &ldquo;You got it.</p>",

What are you\u2013 why\u2013 huh?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Lovely to see you too, dear,\u201d my mum said, inviting herself into my flat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I blinked several times, shutting the door behind her. \u201cIt has\u2026 how did you even know where I lived?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She took off her expensive-looking coat and I watched as her eyes scanned the room, searching for a place to hang it. She decided on hanging it on her arm, holding it to her chest, as if there was nowhere good enough for it. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It wasn\u2019t very difficult,\u201c she said, a judgemental expression on her face, eyeballing my flat. \"No help from you, might I add. You\u2019ve never invited me over.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to come,\u201c I admitted, leading her to the kitchen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I motioned for her to take a seat on the stool as I put the kettle on, knowing she\u2019d want a cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You never asked, so how would you know?\u201d she countered, resting her hands on the countertop hesitantly. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t come here to make you feel bad\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that was just a plus\u2026\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013I came to invite you to my wedding,\u201d she finished, making me stop my actions for a moment. My back was to her, so I couldn\u2019t see her face, but I was taken aback myself and tried not to show it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re marrying Isaac?\u201c I asked, finally turning around, my face expressionless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I am,\u201d she said, a small smile on her lips. \u201cHe proposed a few days ago.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and my mouth formed an \u2018O\u2019 shape. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was feeling weird about this whole thing. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t like Isaac \u2013 he was a lovely man who cared about my mother. In fact, he was the only person who could set her down from her high horse and make her seem more human-like. It was just so random, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought it would be fitting, seeing as you\u2019re my only child, for you to be my maid of honour,\u201c she said, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard the kettle whistle and accepted the distraction, deciding to fill our mugs with water. I was adding the milk when she cleared her throat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s rude not to respond, Y/N,\u201d she said, making me roll my eyes. Same old mum.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Congratulations,\u201c I answered, turning around and setting a cup of tea before her. \"When\u2019s the wedding?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Next week,\u201c she said, making me raise my eyebrows with surprise. \"Being wealthy has its perks. We\u2019ve already planned most things. It\u2019s in Hawaii. A week long. I\u2019m hoping you can make it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My jaw dropped. \u201cHawaii?!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, dear. I\u2019ve already got everything sorted out. Including your tickets. Will you come?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I guess that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, but you said tickets as in more than one. Who are you expecting me to bring?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know you don\u2019t tell me much on our weekly phone calls, but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re with someone,\u201d she said, sure of herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, actually I'm\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Bring them with you,\u201c she said sternly. \"I don\u2019t want you to show up\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Alone and embarrass all of your rich upper-class friends?\u201c I finished, holding my mug and smiling knowingly at my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Don\u2019t put words into my mouth, Y/N,\u201d she said, narrowing her gaze before wrapping her hands around her own mug. \u201cI just want everyone to know you\u2019re doing well. Even if it means bringing that blonde-headed girl with you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cWhat\u2013 Who are you talking about? What girl?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pointed a finger over her shoulder. \u201cThe framed photo? Of you and that blonde? She\u2019s your girlfriend, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I almost choked on my tea. \u201cYou mean Brie? She\u2019s not\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019ll try not to be too offended by the fact that you hid this from me,\u201c she interrupted, once again not listening to a word I was saying. \"It\u2019s very like you to not tell me anything important happening in your life\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum! That\u2019s completely\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013but I\u2019m happy for you, Y/N. And I\u2019m excited to meet her. I know I\u2019ll probably only be introduced at the actual wedding but\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum, she\u2019s not\u2013!\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013I\u2019d appreciate it if you arranged a meeting before then,\u201d she finished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed through gritted teeth. This was one of the reasons she was so <i>infuriating </i>to me. She never listened to a word I said, instead choosing to listen to what she wanted. This was one of the reasons I distanced myself from her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re with someone,\u201c she added as an afterthought. \"I wasn\u2019t sure you would be, considering\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Considering what exactly?\u201c I asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you\u2019ve not exactly achieved a lot, have you?\u201d she said knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m a school councillor and I help teenagers get through difficult times,\u201c I said proudly. \"I think I\u2019ve achieved quite a bit if it means making someone\u2019s day easier. It\u2019s a rewarding career.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stifled a smile. \u201cIf you say so, Y/N\u2026 look, I know I don\u2019t say it much, but I\u2019m proud of you. Technically I haven\u2019t seen you both together, but to <i>know</i> that you\u2019re in a relationship is a good thing. I\u2019m excited to meet this 'Brie\u2019 woman.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I paused, finding it odd to see her staring at me with a sense of pride. She suddenly chose to express her feelings when she thought I was in a relationship? I hated that I felt like that little girl I once was, trying her very hardest to make her mum proud. Because now I felt the need to do it again, even though I knew I didn\u2019t need to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Darling, I\u2019m home!\u201c Brie\u2019s familiar voice called through the flat, followed by the sound of the front door shutting and her laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I wasn\u2019t aware that you shared flat with her,\u201d my mum noted, smiling over the rim of her cup before taking a sip. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I facepalmed at the sound of Brie\u2019s footsteps nearing us. It was a bit between us \u2013 pretending we were a married couple because we\u2019d been living together for two years now. Right now though, I could see how my mum thought otherwise\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, I have the funniest\u2013 oh! I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t aware we had company,\u201c Brie said upon entering the kitchen. A friendly smile was on her lips as she dropped her bag by the counter and stood by my side, opposite my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie, this is my\u2026 <i>mum</i>,\u201d I mumbled, gripping my mug. \u201cMum, this is Brie\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie gave my mum her perfectly angelic smile and outstretched her hand over the counter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Lovely to finally meet you, Brie,\u201c my mum said, and it was the first time I\u2019d seen her smile without it being because of something business-related or Isaac. She shook Brie\u2019s hand, saying, \"Y/N here never mentioned your existence, but it\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled, looping her arm through mine and pulling me close. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. It took me a while to dig basic facts out of this one when we first met. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, too, though, Miss Y/L/N. Y/N\u2019s actually mentioned you a few times, so it\u2019s nice to put a face to a name.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum seemed surprised at this, as she shot me a look. She looked back to Brie, smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Please, call me Y/M/N, Brie.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked between the two, the agitation I was feeling towards my mum slowly disappearing as I saw her looking genuinely happy and, dare I say it\u2026 proud? Was this finally a way to make her actually <i>see </i>me?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201d\u2026Y/N will share the details with you but you <i>must </i>attend our wedding next week.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. \"Wow, really? I mean, we\u2019ve only just met and\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re important to Y/N, so you\u2019re now important to me,\u201c my mum cut her off, before standing up. I won\u2019t accept anything other than a yes.\u201d She was adamant, though her tone was lighthearted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie laughed. \u201cOkay, I guess that\u2019s a yes. Especially if it means I get to see this one in a dress.\u201d She nudged me playfully, making me smile a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Tickets are already taken care of,\u201c my mum said, reaching into her coat pocket before setting two sets of tickets on the counter. Brie looked to me with surprise. I didn\u2019t know what to say at this point. \"I must get going now, but thank you for the tea, Y/N,\u201d my mum said, finishing her last sip before standing up. She looked to me with a genuine smile and sense of pride, making me feel lighter. Was I actually impressing her? Just because I had a (what she thought to be) girlfriend? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Er, yeah, no problem, mum,\u201c I said, letting go of Brie and leading my mum to the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It was a pleasure to meet you, too, Brie,\u201d my mum added as I opened the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Congratulations on your engagement, Y/M/N,\u201c Brie said, smiling. \"Thank you again, for inviting us.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum returned the smile, making me do a double take. She was actually <i>happy. </i>She stopped at the doorway, looking between us both, before nodding at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re a lovely couple,\u201c she complimented, and it was probably the third time in my life she\u2019d paid me a compliment. \"I can\u2019t wait for my friends to see you both.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cWhat? Wait, d'you think\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, mum,\u201c I interrupted Brie, instead intertwining our fingers for my mum to see. I looked to Brie, giving her a look. \"D'you want to say thank you, <i>darling</i>?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie seemed to understand, though I could sense her confusion. Nonetheless, she plastered a smile on her face and pulled me close, looking to my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, Y/M/N,\u201c she said, flashing my mum her signature Brie smile, though her cheeks were now a little pink. \"And thank you for stopping by.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum pulled us both in for a brief hug, making me freeze up with shock. She wasn\u2019t the touchiest of people, so this was definitely a rarity. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I think we should meet up before the wedding,\u201c she said when she pulled away. \"How would you girls like to come to dinner at mine? Tomorrow night? Y/N, you know the address.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was taken aback at her invite. She was thinking about <i>me</i>. Wanting to know <i>me</i>. What alternate universe was I on? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Sure thing, mum, we\u2019ll be there,\u201c I said to her. Was I that desperate for an ounce of my mum\u2019s attention that I\u2019d lie to her? I guess so. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, we\u2019ll see you then,\u201d Brie added, smiling, though I saw her spare me a confused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Perfect. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201c My mum gave me one last look over before turning to leave. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed the door behind her before releasing a breath, feeling the tension in my chest unknot. Same effect, as always. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Care to share what just happened, <i>sweetie</i>?\u201d Brie said in a teasing high-pitched voice, raising our intertwined hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"My mum happened,\u201c I groaned, going to the couch to flop onto it face-first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, why does your mum think we\u2019re dating? It now makes sense why she would suddenly invite me to Hawaii when I just met her, but yeah, I\u2019m a little lost still.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard Brie\u2019s voice get closer and I assumed she was sat on the chair beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Because she likes to think she has the perfect daughter when she doesn\u2019t,\u201c I said, my voice slightly muffled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed before sitting up, meeting Brie\u2019s concerned gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 she just came out of nowhere. She\u2019s never even been here. She\u2019s getting married and wants me to be the maid of honour so she can impress all of her rich snobby friends. And she thinks we\u2019re dating because she saw a photo of us and didn\u2019t listen to me when I tried to tell her we weren\u2019t.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you might want to tell her otherwise because she thinks we\u2019re going to her wedding\u2026\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled awkwardly. \"Maybe because we are\u2026?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. \u201cY/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, come on,\u201c I said, trying to sound convincing, \"it won\u2019t be bad! She already thinks we\u2019re together and I\u2019ve never seen her look so proud of me before. Did you know that was the first hug she\u2019s given me in three years?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie widened her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cShe and I aren\u2019t very close\u2026 she cares too much about what other people think of her. Of me. I left as soon as I could afford to and have been fine ever since. We talk every now and then, but nothing meaningful\u2026 she\u2019s my mum, though, and I guess I want her to be proud of me. This is the first time she\u2019s been remotely interested in my life. She invited me to dinner tomorrow! She\u2019s never done that!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, that sucks and I\u2019m really sorry,\u201c Brie started, a frown on her lips, \"but this is crazy. We can\u2019t just be girlfriends to impress her. You can\u2019t lie to her.\u201d She avoided my eyes, her cheeks growing pink, making me wonder why she was suddenly so embarrassed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I can,\u201c I said, nodding my head. \"Look, it won\u2019t be long. Just her engagement party and the wedding and it\u2019s done. Plus it\u2019s in Hawaii, so it\u2019ll be like a holiday! I just want her to be proud of me. It won\u2019t be hard, I mean, we\u2019re already close and how many times have people thought we\u2019re a couple?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She quirked an eyebrow. \u201cNever?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"The mail man!\u201c I pointed out, a little unconvincingly. \"Remember? He thought we were girlfriends.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"He was also sent to prison for perving on the neighbours,\u201c she added, studying me curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waved my hand dismissively. \"Prison, shmison. Look, I\u2019ll love you forever if you do this one thing for me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, so you don\u2019t love me forever now?\u201c she asked teasingly, a smile tugging at her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You know I do,\u201d I said, returning the smile. \u201cCome on. What could go wrong?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, watching me. I smiled hopefully, moving closer to her and resting my hands on hers. She sighed, rolling her eyes, as if to distract from her now red cheeks.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Fine, I\u2019ll do it,\u201c she gave in, making me grin and jump on her, pulling her in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d I said, kissing her face several times. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She laughed, shoving me off her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, idiot. Now. I need the rundown on your mother. She\u2019s a\u2026 <i>unique</i> character.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded, a grin on my lips. \u201cYou got it.</p>",

What are you\u2013 why\u2013 huh?\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Lovely to see you too, dear,\u201d my mum said, inviting herself into my flat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I blinked several times, shutting the door behind her. \u201cIt has\u2026 how did you even know where I lived?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She took off her expensive-looking coat and I watched as her eyes scanned the room, searching for a place to hang it. She decided on hanging it on her arm, holding it to her chest, as if there was nowhere good enough for it. </p>[[MORE]]<p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It wasn\u2019t very difficult,\u201c she said, a judgemental expression on her face, eyeballing my flat. \"No help from you, might I add. You\u2019ve never invited me over.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to come,\u201c I admitted, leading her to the kitchen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I motioned for her to take a seat on the stool as I put the kettle on, knowing she\u2019d want a cup of tea. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You never asked, so how would you know?\u201d she countered, resting her hands on the countertop hesitantly. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t come here to make you feel bad\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that was just a plus\u2026\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013I came to invite you to my wedding,\u201d she finished, making me stop my actions for a moment. My back was to her, so I couldn\u2019t see her face, but I was taken aback myself and tried not to show it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re marrying Isaac?\u201c I asked, finally turning around, my face expressionless. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I am,\u201d she said, a small smile on her lips. \u201cHe proposed a few days ago.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded and my mouth formed an \u2018O\u2019 shape. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was feeling weird about this whole thing. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t like Isaac \u2013 he was a lovely man who cared about my mother. In fact, he was the only person who could set her down from her high horse and make her seem more human-like. It was just so random, I guess. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I thought it would be fitting, seeing as you\u2019re my only child, for you to be my maid of honour,\u201c she said, meeting my eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard the kettle whistle and accepted the distraction, deciding to fill our mugs with water. I was adding the milk when she cleared her throat. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It\u2019s rude not to respond, Y/N,\u201d she said, making me roll my eyes. Same old mum.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Congratulations,\u201c I answered, turning around and setting a cup of tea before her. \"When\u2019s the wedding?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Next week,\u201c she said, making me raise my eyebrows with surprise. \"Being wealthy has its perks. We\u2019ve already planned most things. It\u2019s in Hawaii. A week long. I\u2019m hoping you can make it?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My jaw dropped. \u201cHawaii?!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, dear. I\u2019ve already got everything sorted out. Including your tickets. Will you come?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I guess that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, but you said tickets as in more than one. Who are you expecting me to bring?\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I know you don\u2019t tell me much on our weekly phone calls, but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re with someone,\u201d she said, sure of herself. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, actually I'm\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Bring them with you,\u201c she said sternly. \"I don\u2019t want you to show up\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Alone and embarrass all of your rich upper-class friends?\u201c I finished, holding my mug and smiling knowingly at my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Don\u2019t put words into my mouth, Y/N,\u201d she said, narrowing her gaze before wrapping her hands around her own mug. \u201cI just want everyone to know you\u2019re doing well. Even if it means bringing that blonde-headed girl with you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cWhat\u2013 Who are you talking about? What girl?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pointed a finger over her shoulder. \u201cThe framed photo? Of you and that blonde? She\u2019s your girlfriend, right?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I almost choked on my tea. \u201cYou mean Brie? She\u2019s not\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019ll try not to be too offended by the fact that you hid this from me,\u201c she interrupted, once again not listening to a word I was saying. \"It\u2019s very like you to not tell me anything important happening in your life\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum! That\u2019s completely\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013but I\u2019m happy for you, Y/N. And I\u2019m excited to meet her. I know I\u2019ll probably only be introduced at the actual wedding but\u2013\"</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Mum, she\u2019s not\u2013!\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"\u2013I\u2019d appreciate it if you arranged a meeting before then,\u201d she finished. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed through gritted teeth. This was one of the reasons she was so <i>infuriating </i>to me. She never listened to a word I said, instead choosing to listen to what she wanted. This was one of the reasons I distanced myself from her. </p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re with someone,\u201c she added as an afterthought. \"I wasn\u2019t sure you would be, considering\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Considering what exactly?\u201c I asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you\u2019ve not exactly achieved a lot, have you?\u201d she said knowingly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I\u2019m a school councillor and I help teenagers get through difficult times,\u201c I said proudly. \"I think I\u2019ve achieved quite a bit if it means making someone\u2019s day easier. It\u2019s a rewarding career.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She stifled a smile. \u201cIf you say so, Y/N\u2026 look, I know I don\u2019t say it much, but I\u2019m proud of you. Technically I haven\u2019t seen you both together, but to <i>know</i> that you\u2019re in a relationship is a good thing. I\u2019m excited to meet this 'Brie\u2019 woman.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I paused, finding it odd to see her staring at me with a sense of pride. She suddenly chose to express her feelings when she thought I was in a relationship? I hated that I felt like that little girl I once was, trying her very hardest to make her mum proud. Because now I felt the need to do it again, even though I knew I didn\u2019t need to. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Darling, I\u2019m home!\u201c Brie\u2019s familiar voice called through the flat, followed by the sound of the front door shutting and her laughter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I wasn\u2019t aware that you shared flat with her,\u201d my mum noted, smiling over the rim of her cup before taking a sip. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I facepalmed at the sound of Brie\u2019s footsteps nearing us. It was a bit between us \u2013 pretending we were a married couple because we\u2019d been living together for two years now. Right now though, I could see how my mum thought otherwise\u2026</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, I have the funniest\u2013 oh! I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t aware we had company,\u201c Brie said upon entering the kitchen. A friendly smile was on her lips as she dropped her bag by the counter and stood by my side, opposite my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Brie, this is my\u2026 <i>mum</i>,\u201d I mumbled, gripping my mug. \u201cMum, this is Brie\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie gave my mum her perfectly angelic smile and outstretched her hand over the counter. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Lovely to finally meet you, Brie,\u201c my mum said, and it was the first time I\u2019d seen her smile without it being because of something business-related or Isaac. She shook Brie\u2019s hand, saying, \"Y/N here never mentioned your existence, but it\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled, looping her arm through mine and pulling me close. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. It took me a while to dig basic facts out of this one when we first met. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, too, though, Miss Y/L/N. Y/N\u2019s actually mentioned you a few times, so it\u2019s nice to put a face to a name.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum seemed surprised at this, as she shot me a look. She looked back to Brie, smiling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Please, call me Y/M/N, Brie.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I looked between the two, the agitation I was feeling towards my mum slowly disappearing as I saw her looking genuinely happy and, dare I say it\u2026 proud? Was this finally a way to make her actually <i>see </i>me?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201d\u2026Y/N will share the details with you but you <i>must </i>attend our wedding next week.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. \"Wow, really? I mean, we\u2019ve only just met and\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re important to Y/N, so you\u2019re now important to me,\u201c my mum cut her off, before standing up. I won\u2019t accept anything other than a yes.\u201d She was adamant, though her tone was lighthearted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie laughed. \u201cOkay, I guess that\u2019s a yes. Especially if it means I get to see this one in a dress.\u201d She nudged me playfully, making me smile a little. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Tickets are already taken care of,\u201c my mum said, reaching into her coat pocket before setting two sets of tickets on the counter. Brie looked to me with surprise. I didn\u2019t know what to say at this point. \"I must get going now, but thank you for the tea, Y/N,\u201d my mum said, finishing her last sip before standing up. She looked to me with a genuine smile and sense of pride, making me feel lighter. Was I actually impressing her? Just because I had a (what she thought to be) girlfriend? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Er, yeah, no problem, mum,\u201c I said, letting go of Brie and leading my mum to the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"It was a pleasure to meet you, too, Brie,\u201d my mum added as I opened the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Congratulations on your engagement, Y/M/N,\u201c Brie said, smiling. \"Thank you again, for inviting us.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum returned the smile, making me do a double take. She was actually <i>happy. </i>She stopped at the doorway, looking between us both, before nodding at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You\u2019re a lovely couple,\u201c she complimented, and it was probably the third time in my life she\u2019d paid me a compliment. \"I can\u2019t wait for my friends to see you both.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie chuckled. \u201cWhat? Wait, d'you think\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thanks, mum,\u201c I interrupted Brie, instead intertwining our fingers for my mum to see. I looked to Brie, giving her a look. \"D'you want to say thank you, <i>darling</i>?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie seemed to understand, though I could sense her confusion. Nonetheless, she plastered a smile on her face and pulled me close, looking to my mum. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, Y/M/N,\u201c she said, flashing my mum her signature Brie smile, though her cheeks were now a little pink. \"And thank you for stopping by.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0My mum pulled us both in for a brief hug, making me freeze up with shock. She wasn\u2019t the touchiest of people, so this was definitely a rarity. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"I think we should meet up before the wedding,\u201c she said when she pulled away. \"How would you girls like to come to dinner at mine? Tomorrow night? Y/N, you know the address.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was taken aback at her invite. She was thinking about <i>me</i>. Wanting to know <i>me</i>. What alternate universe was I on? </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Sure thing, mum, we\u2019ll be there,\u201c I said to her. Was I that desperate for an ounce of my mum\u2019s attention that I\u2019d lie to her? I guess so. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Yeah, we\u2019ll see you then,\u201d Brie added, smiling, though I saw her spare me a confused glance. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Perfect. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201c My mum gave me one last look over before turning to leave. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I closed the door behind her before releasing a breath, feeling the tension in my chest unknot. Same effect, as always. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Care to share what just happened, <i>sweetie</i>?\u201d Brie said in a teasing high-pitched voice, raising our intertwined hands. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"My mum happened,\u201c I groaned, going to the couch to flop onto it face-first. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, why does your mum think we\u2019re dating? It now makes sense why she would suddenly invite me to Hawaii when I just met her, but yeah, I\u2019m a little lost still.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I heard Brie\u2019s voice get closer and I assumed she was sat on the chair beside me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Because she likes to think she has the perfect daughter when she doesn\u2019t,\u201c I said, my voice slightly muffled.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N\u2026\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I sighed before sitting up, meeting Brie\u2019s concerned gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 she just came out of nowhere. She\u2019s never even been here. She\u2019s getting married and wants me to be the maid of honour so she can impress all of her rich snobby friends. And she thinks we\u2019re dating because she saw a photo of us and didn\u2019t listen to me when I tried to tell her we weren\u2019t.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you might want to tell her otherwise because she thinks we\u2019re going to her wedding\u2026\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I smiled awkwardly. \"Maybe because we are\u2026?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie raised her eyebrows. \u201cY/N?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, come on,\u201c I said, trying to sound convincing, \"it won\u2019t be bad! She already thinks we\u2019re together and I\u2019ve never seen her look so proud of me before. Did you know that was the first hug she\u2019s given me in three years?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Brie widened her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded. \u201cShe and I aren\u2019t very close\u2026 she cares too much about what other people think of her. Of me. I left as soon as I could afford to and have been fine ever since. We talk every now and then, but nothing meaningful\u2026 she\u2019s my mum, though, and I guess I want her to be proud of me. This is the first time she\u2019s been remotely interested in my life. She invited me to dinner tomorrow! She\u2019s never done that!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Y/N, that sucks and I\u2019m really sorry,\u201c Brie started, a frown on her lips, \"but this is crazy. We can\u2019t just be girlfriends to impress her. You can\u2019t lie to her.\u201d She avoided my eyes, her cheeks growing pink, making me wonder why she was suddenly so embarrassed. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I can,\u201c I said, nodding my head. \"Look, it won\u2019t be long. Just her engagement party and the wedding and it\u2019s done. Plus it\u2019s in Hawaii, so it\u2019ll be like a holiday! I just want her to be proud of me. It won\u2019t be hard, I mean, we\u2019re already close and how many times have people thought we\u2019re a couple?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She quirked an eyebrow. \u201cNever?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"The mail man!\u201c I pointed out, a little unconvincingly. \"Remember? He thought we were girlfriends.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"He was also sent to prison for perving on the neighbours,\u201c she added, studying me curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I waved my hand dismissively. \"Prison, shmison. Look, I\u2019ll love you forever if you do this one thing for me.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, so you don\u2019t love me forever now?\u201c she asked teasingly, a smile tugging at her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"You know I do,\u201d I said, returning the smile. \u201cCome on. What could go wrong?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She pursed her lips, watching me. I smiled hopefully, moving closer to her and resting my hands on hers. She sighed, rolling her eyes, as if to distract from her now red cheeks.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Fine, I\u2019ll do it,\u201c she gave in, making me grin and jump on her, pulling her in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d I said, kissing her face several times. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0She laughed, shoving me off her. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, idiot. Now. I need the rundown on your mother. She\u2019s a\u2026 <i>unique</i> character.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I nodded, a grin on my lips. \u201cYou got it.</p>",

What are you&ndash; why&ndash; huh?&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Lovely to see you too, dear,&rdquo; my mum said, inviting herself into my flat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked several times, shutting the door behind her. &ldquo;It has&hellip; how did you even know where I lived?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her expensive-looking coat and I watched as her eyes scanned the room, searching for a place to hang it. She decided on hanging it on her arm, holding it to her chest, as if there was nowhere good enough for it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It wasn&rsquo;t very difficult,&ldquo; she said, a judgemental expression on her face, eyeballing my flat. \"No help from you, might I add. You&rsquo;ve never invited me over.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to come,&ldquo; I admitted, leading her to the kitchen. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I motioned for her to take a seat on the stool as I put the kettle on, knowing she&rsquo;d want a cup of tea. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You never asked, so how would you know?&rdquo; she countered, resting her hands on the countertop hesitantly. &ldquo;Besides, I didn&rsquo;t come here to make you feel bad&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Oh, that was just a plus&hellip;&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"&ndash;I came to invite you to my wedding,&rdquo; she finished, making me stop my actions for a moment. My back was to her, so I couldn&rsquo;t see her face, but I was taken aback myself and tried not to show it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re marrying Isaac?&ldquo; I asked, finally turning around, my face expressionless. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am,&rdquo; she said, a small smile on her lips. &ldquo;He proposed a few days ago.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded and my mouth formed an &lsquo;O&rsquo; shape. I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I was feeling weird about this whole thing. It&rsquo;s not like I didn&rsquo;t like Isaac &ndash; he was a lovely man who cared about my mother. In fact, he was the only person who could set her down from her high horse and make her seem more human-like. It was just so random, I guess. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I thought it would be fitting, seeing as you&rsquo;re my only child, for you to be my maid of honour,&ldquo; she said, meeting my eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the kettle whistle and accepted the distraction, deciding to fill our mugs with water. I was adding the milk when she cleared her throat. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s rude not to respond, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, making me roll my eyes. Same old mum.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Congratulations,&ldquo; I answered, turning around and setting a cup of tea before her. \"When&rsquo;s the wedding?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Next week,&ldquo; she said, making me raise my eyebrows with surprise. \"Being wealthy has its perks. We&rsquo;ve already planned most things. It&rsquo;s in Hawaii. A week long. I&rsquo;m hoping you can make it?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My jaw dropped. &ldquo;Hawaii?!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Yes, dear. I&rsquo;ve already got everything sorted out. Including your tickets. Will you come?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I guess that wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, but you said tickets as in more than one. Who are you expecting me to bring?&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I know you don&rsquo;t tell me much on our weekly phone calls, but I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re with someone,&rdquo; she said, sure of herself. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, actually I'm&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bring them with you,&ldquo; she said sternly. \"I don&rsquo;t want you to show up&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Alone and embarrass all of your rich upper-class friends?&ldquo; I finished, holding my mug and smiling knowingly at my mum. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t put words into my mouth, Y/N,&rdquo; she said, narrowing her gaze before wrapping her hands around her own mug. &ldquo;I just want everyone to know you&rsquo;re doing well. Even if it means bringing that blonde-headed girl with you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I furrowed my eyebrows. &ldquo;What&ndash; Who are you talking about? What girl?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed a finger over her shoulder. &ldquo;The framed photo? Of you and that blonde? She&rsquo;s your girlfriend, right?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I almost choked on my tea. &ldquo;You mean Brie? She&rsquo;s not&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ll try not to be too offended by the fact that you hid this from me,&ldquo; she interrupted, once again not listening to a word I was saying. \"It&rsquo;s very like you to not tell me anything important happening in your life&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mum! That&rsquo;s completely&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"&ndash;but I&rsquo;m happy for you, Y/N. And I&rsquo;m excited to meet her. I know I&rsquo;ll probably only be introduced at the actual wedding but&ndash;\"</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mum, she&rsquo;s not&ndash;!&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"&ndash;I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you arranged a meeting before then,&rdquo; she finished. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed through gritted teeth. This was one of the reasons she was so <i>infuriating </i>to me. She never listened to a word I said, instead choosing to listen to what she wanted. This was one of the reasons I distanced myself from her. </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re with someone,&ldquo; she added as an afterthought. \"I wasn&rsquo;t sure you would be, considering&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Considering what exactly?&ldquo; I asked, raising an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, you&rsquo;ve not exactly achieved a lot, have you?&rdquo; she said knowingly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m a school councillor and I help teenagers get through difficult times,&ldquo; I said proudly. \"I think I&rsquo;ve achieved quite a bit if it means making someone&rsquo;s day easier. It&rsquo;s a rewarding career.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stifled a smile. &ldquo;If you say so, Y/N&hellip; look, I know I don&rsquo;t say it much, but I&rsquo;m proud of you. Technically I haven&rsquo;t seen you both together, but to <i>know</i> that you&rsquo;re in a relationship is a good thing. I&rsquo;m excited to meet this 'Brie&rsquo; woman.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I paused, finding it odd to see her staring at me with a sense of pride. She suddenly chose to express her feelings when she thought I was in a relationship? I hated that I felt like that little girl I once was, trying her very hardest to make her mum proud. Because now I felt the need to do it again, even though I knew I didn&rsquo;t need to. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Darling, I&rsquo;m home!&ldquo; Brie&rsquo;s familiar voice called through the flat, followed by the sound of the front door shutting and her laughter. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I wasn&rsquo;t aware that you shared flat with her,&rdquo; my mum noted, smiling over the rim of her cup before taking a sip. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I facepalmed at the sound of Brie&rsquo;s footsteps nearing us. It was a bit between us &ndash; pretending we were a married couple because we&rsquo;d been living together for two years now. Right now though, I could see how my mum thought otherwise&hellip;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, I have the funniest&ndash; oh! I&rsquo;m sorry, I wasn&rsquo;t aware we had company,&ldquo; Brie said upon entering the kitchen. A friendly smile was on her lips as she dropped her bag by the counter and stood by my side, opposite my mum. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Brie, this is my&hellip; <i>mum</i>,&rdquo; I mumbled, gripping my mug. &ldquo;Mum, this is Brie&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie gave my mum her perfectly angelic smile and outstretched her hand over the counter. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Lovely to finally meet you, Brie,&ldquo; my mum said, and it was the first time I&rsquo;d seen her smile without it being because of something business-related or Isaac. She shook Brie&rsquo;s hand, saying, \"Y/N here never mentioned your existence, but it&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie chuckled, looping her arm through mine and pulling me close. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. It took me a while to dig basic facts out of this one when we first met. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you, too, though, Miss Y/L/N. Y/N&rsquo;s actually mentioned you a few times, so it&rsquo;s nice to put a face to a name.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum seemed surprised at this, as she shot me a look. She looked back to Brie, smiling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Please, call me Y/M/N, Brie.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I looked between the two, the agitation I was feeling towards my mum slowly disappearing as I saw her looking genuinely happy and, dare I say it&hellip; proud? Was this finally a way to make her actually <i>see </i>me?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;&hellip;Y/N will share the details with you but you <i>must </i>attend our wedding next week.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie raised her eyebrows. \"Wow, really? I mean, we&rsquo;ve only just met and&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re important to Y/N, so you&rsquo;re now important to me,&ldquo; my mum cut her off, before standing up. I won&rsquo;t accept anything other than a yes.&rdquo; She was adamant, though her tone was lighthearted. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie laughed. &ldquo;Okay, I guess that&rsquo;s a yes. Especially if it means I get to see this one in a dress.&rdquo; She nudged me playfully, making me smile a little. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Tickets are already taken care of,&ldquo; my mum said, reaching into her coat pocket before setting two sets of tickets on the counter. Brie looked to me with surprise. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say at this point. \"I must get going now, but thank you for the tea, Y/N,&rdquo; my mum said, finishing her last sip before standing up. She looked to me with a genuine smile and sense of pride, making me feel lighter. Was I actually impressing her? Just because I had a (what she thought to be) girlfriend? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Er, yeah, no problem, mum,&ldquo; I said, letting go of Brie and leading my mum to the door. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was a pleasure to meet you, too, Brie,&rdquo; my mum added as I opened the door. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Congratulations on your engagement, Y/M/N,&ldquo; Brie said, smiling. \"Thank you again, for inviting us.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum returned the smile, making me do a double take. She was actually <i>happy. </i>She stopped at the doorway, looking between us both, before nodding at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re a lovely couple,&ldquo; she complimented, and it was probably the third time in my life she&rsquo;d paid me a compliment. \"I can&rsquo;t wait for my friends to see you both.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie chuckled. &ldquo;What? Wait, d'you think&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thanks, mum,&ldquo; I interrupted Brie, instead intertwining our fingers for my mum to see. I looked to Brie, giving her a look. \"D'you want to say thank you, <i>darling</i>?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie seemed to understand, though I could sense her confusion. Nonetheless, she plastered a smile on her face and pulled me close, looking to my mum. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you, Y/M/N,&ldquo; she said, flashing my mum her signature Brie smile, though her cheeks were now a little pink. \"And thank you for stopping by.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mum pulled us both in for a brief hug, making me freeze up with shock. She wasn&rsquo;t the touchiest of people, so this was definitely a rarity. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"I think we should meet up before the wedding,&ldquo; she said when she pulled away. \"How would you girls like to come to dinner at mine? Tomorrow night? Y/N, you know the address.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was taken aback at her invite. She was thinking about <i>me</i>. Wanting to know <i>me</i>. What alternate universe was I on? </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sure thing, mum, we&rsquo;ll be there,&ldquo; I said to her. Was I that desperate for an ounce of my mum&rsquo;s attention that I&rsquo;d lie to her? I guess so. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yeah, we&rsquo;ll see you then,&rdquo; Brie added, smiling, though I saw her spare me a confused glance. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Perfect. I&rsquo;ll see you then.&ldquo; My mum gave me one last look over before turning to leave. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I closed the door behind her before releasing a breath, feeling the tension in my chest unknot. Same effect, as always. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Care to share what just happened, <i>sweetie</i>?&rdquo; Brie said in a teasing high-pitched voice, raising our intertwined hands. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"My mum happened,&ldquo; I groaned, going to the couch to flop onto it face-first. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, why does your mum think we&rsquo;re dating? It now makes sense why she would suddenly invite me to Hawaii when I just met her, but yeah, I&rsquo;m a little lost still.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I heard Brie&rsquo;s voice get closer and I assumed she was sat on the chair beside me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Because she likes to think she has the perfect daughter when she doesn&rsquo;t,&ldquo; I said, my voice slightly muffled.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed before sitting up, meeting Brie&rsquo;s concerned gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip; she just came out of nowhere. She&rsquo;s never even been here. She&rsquo;s getting married and wants me to be the maid of honour so she can impress all of her rich snobby friends. And she thinks we&rsquo;re dating because she saw a photo of us and didn&rsquo;t listen to me when I tried to tell her we weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, you might want to tell her otherwise because she thinks we&rsquo;re going to her wedding&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I smiled awkwardly. \"Maybe because we are&hellip;?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Y/N?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Oh, come on,&ldquo; I said, trying to sound convincing, \"it won&rsquo;t be bad! She already thinks we&rsquo;re together and I&rsquo;ve never seen her look so proud of me before. Did you know that was the first hug she&rsquo;s given me in three years?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brie widened her eyes. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded. &ldquo;She and I aren&rsquo;t very close&hellip; she cares too much about what other people think of her. Of me. I left as soon as I could afford to and have been fine ever since. We talk every now and then, but nothing meaningful&hellip; she&rsquo;s my mum, though, and I guess I want her to be proud of me. This is the first time she&rsquo;s been remotely interested in my life. She invited me to dinner tomorrow! She&rsquo;s never done that!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Y/N, that sucks and I&rsquo;m really sorry,&ldquo; Brie started, a frown on her lips, \"but this is crazy. We can&rsquo;t just be girlfriends to impress her. You can&rsquo;t lie to her.&rdquo; She avoided my eyes, her cheeks growing pink, making me wonder why she was suddenly so embarrassed. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Oh, I can,&ldquo; I said, nodding my head. \"Look, it won&rsquo;t be long. Just her engagement party and the wedding and it&rsquo;s done. Plus it&rsquo;s in Hawaii, so it&rsquo;ll be like a holiday! I just want her to be proud of me. It won&rsquo;t be hard, I mean, we&rsquo;re already close and how many times have people thought we&rsquo;re a couple?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She quirked an eyebrow. &ldquo;Never?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"The mail man!&ldquo; I pointed out, a little unconvincingly. \"Remember? He thought we were girlfriends.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"He was also sent to prison for perving on the neighbours,&ldquo; she added, studying me curiously. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I waved my hand dismissively. \"Prison, shmison. Look, I&rsquo;ll love you forever if you do this one thing for me.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Oh, so you don&rsquo;t love me forever now?&ldquo; she asked teasingly, a smile tugging at her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"You know I do,&rdquo; I said, returning the smile. &ldquo;Come on. What could go wrong?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She pursed her lips, watching me. I smiled hopefully, moving closer to her and resting my hands on hers. She sighed, rolling her eyes, as if to distract from her now red cheeks.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Fine, I&rsquo;ll do it,&ldquo; she gave in, making me grin and jump on her, pulling her in for a hug. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!&rdquo; I said, kissing her face several times. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed, shoving me off her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, idiot. Now. I need the rundown on your mother. She&rsquo;s a&hellip; <i>unique</i> character.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I nodded, a grin on my lips. &ldquo;You got it.</p>",
