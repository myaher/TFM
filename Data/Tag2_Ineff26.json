Not how I want to eat every day, mind, but it\u2019s good for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the wine was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked it up in Italy&hellip;oh, a few years back.\u201d</p><p>They pack up the leavings of their lunch, looking more like choreographed dancers than picnickers.</p><p>Actually, they look like an angel and a demon who have spent six thousand years dancing around each other, each trying to work the other out. Maybe it <i>is</i> choreography.</p><p>Since the not end of the world they\u2019ve fallen into a bit of a pattern: lunch dates (though neither of them dares call what they\u2019re doing \u201cdating\u201d), evenings in Aziraphale\u2019s back room or watching Crowley\u2019s telly (Crowley introduces Aziraphale to a great many movies, and is taken aback by the angel\u2019s overwhelming addiction to <i>Star Wars</i>. \u201cIt\u2019s light vs. dark!\u201d he says, eyebrows lifted high.), \u00a0going places for fun instead of for work (just last week they\u2019d met up in San Francisco, and after sunset Crowley had flicked his wrist and covered the Golden Gate Bridge with a rainbow of colored lights. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the pretty decorations,\u201d he insists. \u201cJust think of the electricity that\u2019s using up.\u201d Aziraphale smiles knowingly, mutters \u201cwho\u2019s the soft one now?\u201d under his breath.).</p><p>Their dance brings them closer to each other every day.</p><p>Is it possible for the not quite end of the world to bring a beginning instead?</p><!-- more --><p>Back at the car, Aziraphale\u2019s face lights up with sudden inspiration. \u201cDo you think I could, ah, drive?\u201d</p><p>Crowley\u2019s face remains unreadable. The sunglasses help with this, of course, but he\u2019s become formidable at schooling his features over the millenia. \u201cDrive?\u201d he repeats. \u201cThe Bentley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always make it look like so much fun. And it\u2019s been such a lovely day\u2026\u201d</p><p>Thankful that the sunglasses hide his eyeroll, Crowley says, \u201cStop, stop. Don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your eyes all wide and impossible to say no to.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale takes a little hop-step toward the car, and then another. \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d He sounds rather like a small child asking if it\u2019s time to cut his birthday cake.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, angel. We\u2019re going to find a nice empty car park for you to practice in, alright? I haven\u2019t seen you drive once, and it\u2019s been over a century since the automobile was invented.\u201d</p><p>Crestfallen, Aziraphale mumbles, \u201cI drove the motorbike.\u201d</p><p>Crowley actually snorts. \u201cThat was Madame Tracy driving, and you know it. You just miracled it to go faster.\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale looks at his toes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Crowley opens the passenger door and ushers Aziraphale into the car. \u201cNow, come on, don\u2019t pout. You can give it a go. Just, well, not here. Too many trees. And cars.\u201d A duck splashes on the pond. \u201cAnd ducks.\u201d He shuts the door and saunters around to the other side.</p><p>. + . + . + .</p><p>He\u2019s trying. He really is trying. But Aziraphale is not helping.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this button do, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadlamps. But it\u2019s daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the radio. I think you should just focus on driving and let me deal with the music. Or better yet, we leave it off and minimize your distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s the radio, Aziraphale. I\u2019ve seen you work it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks different from over here!\u201d</p><p>Crowley groans.</p><p>Aziraphale runs his hands over the steering wheel. \u201cWhich pedal makes us go again?\u201d</p><p>Crowley goes the kind of still you don\u2019t generally find in living things, and Aziraphale titters. \u201cJust a joke.\u201d He looks at his feet. \u201cMostly.\u201d</p><p>Crowley groans.</p><p>But then he looks at Aziraphale again. He\u2019s sitting contentedly in the driver\u2019s seat, taking everything in, touching all the levers and buttons, resting his palms on the steering wheel. Crowley is reminded of Aziraphale in his bookshop, occasionally reaching out to touch the spine of a book as he walks by.</p><p>So Crowley just watches. He notices the tiny smile on Aziraphale\u2019s face, the way his eyes light up when he holds the steering wheel. The way he peeks in the mirror, then glances at Crowley to see if he\u2019s watching.</p><p>He makes no move to actually start the car.</p><p>After half an hour of sitting in the car&ndash;mostly in comfortable silence, but with a bit of intermittent chatter from Aziraphale: \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d \u201cMy they make these things complicated, don\u2019t they.\u201d&ndash;he turns to Crowley. His smile is somewhat embarrassed. But before he says anything Crowley says, \u201cAlright then, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d says Aziraphale, visibly relieved. \u201cI thought it was about the driving, but really it was about, well&ndash;\u201d He turns a bit pink.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s heart quickens. But hope, he learned long ago, is too painful a thing. Still, his traitorous mouth says, \u201cAziraphale?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale looks at his lap. \u201cYou,\u201d he says softly. \u201cIt was about you.\u201d</p><p>The air in the car, pleasant and comfortable only moments before, suddenly feels stifling. Suffocating. Crowley doesn\u2019t actually need to breathe, but that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>\u201cFor decades now I\u2019ve watched you sit here, slicing through traffic, easing your way through the world. This car, it\u2019s&ndash;well, it\u2019s <i>you</i>, Crowley. I can feel you in every switch and button, can feel your palms under mine on the steering wheel. I\u2019m surprised your reflection doesn\u2019t peer back at me from the mirror. And this seat, ah,\u201d He blushes again, and Crowley thinks he might not go on, but then he looks up and says, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a hug, you fiend.\u201d</p><p>Crowley has never heard such affection.</p><p>After taking a moment to be sure he can trust his voice, he says, \u201cThere are other ways to hug, you know. Better ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d says Aziraphale. Then, eyebrows raised, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Slow and tentative, Crowley stretches out his arm until his hand is resting, palm up, on Aziraphale\u2019s knee. Aziraphale looks from the inviting palm to Crowley\u2019s face, a question in his eyes. Crowley nods. Without looking away Aziraphale slips his hand into Crowley\u2019s, fingers effortlessly lacing together.</p><p>Crowley wants to say something. He wants to tell his best friend that being together like this makes him feel whole in a way he\u2019s been aching for since the dawn of creation. That the feel of their palms pressed together makes him yearn for more, to feel endless skin against his own with nothing getting in the way, especially not any of their angelic or demonic hangups.</p><p>But he can\u2019t say any of that. Not yet. If he tries to speak right now he\u2019ll just say something cool, or something that sounds like he\u2019s trying desperately to be cool. Probably the latter.</p><p>So he just takes off his sunglasses. Hopefully Aziraphale can see.</p><p>He is rewarded with one of Aziraphale\u2019s blinding smiles. It almost hurts his eyes. \u201cI like when you do that,\u201d Aziraphale says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d</p>",

The way he peeks in the mirror, then glances at Crowley to see if he\u2019s watching.</p><p>He makes no move to actually start the car.</p><p>After half an hour of sitting in the car\u2013mostly in comfortable silence, but with a bit of intermittent chatter from Aziraphale: \u201cWhat about this one?\u201d \u201cMy they make these things complicated, don\u2019t they.\u201d\u2013he turns to Crowley. His smile is somewhat embarrassed. But before he says anything Crowley says, \u201cAlright then, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d says Aziraphale, visibly relieved. \u201cI thought it was about the driving, but really it was about, well\u2013\u201d He turns a bit pink.</p><p>Crowley\u2019s heart quickens. But hope, he learned long ago, is too painful a thing. Still, his traitorous mouth says, \u201cAziraphale?\u201d</p><p>Aziraphale looks at his lap. \u201cYou,\u201d he says softly. \u201cIt was about you.\u201d</p><p>The air in the car, pleasant and comfortable only moments before, suddenly feels stifling. Suffocating. Crowley doesn\u2019t actually need to breathe, but that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>\u201cFor decades now I\u2019ve watched you sit here, slicing through traffic, easing your way through the world. This car, it\u2019s\u2013well, it\u2019s <i>you</i>, Crowley. I can feel you in every switch and button, can feel your palms under mine on the steering wheel. I\u2019m surprised your reflection doesn\u2019t peer back at me from the mirror. And this seat, ah,\u201d He blushes again, and Crowley thinks he might not go on, but then he looks up and says, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a hug, you fiend.\u201d</p><p>Crowley has never heard such affection.</p><p>After taking a moment to be sure he can trust his voice, he says, \u201cThere are other ways to hug, you know. Better ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d says Aziraphale. Then, eyebrows raised, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Slow and tentative, Crowley stretches out his arm until his hand is resting, palm up, on Aziraphale\u2019s knee. Aziraphale looks from the inviting palm to Crowley\u2019s face, a question in his eyes. Crowley nods. Without looking away Aziraphale slips his hand into Crowley\u2019s, fingers effortlessly lacing together.</p><p>Crowley wants to say something. He wants to tell his best friend that being together like this makes him feel whole in a way he\u2019s been aching for since the dawn of creation. That the feel of their palms pressed together makes him yearn for more, to feel endless skin against his own with nothing getting in the way, especially not any of their angelic or demonic hangups.</p><p>But he can\u2019t say any of that. Not yet. If he tries to speak right now he\u2019ll just say something cool, or something that sounds like he\u2019s trying desperately to be cool. Probably the latter.</p><p>So he just takes off his sunglasses. Hopefully Aziraphale can see.</p><p>He is rewarded with one of Aziraphale\u2019s blinding smiles. It almost hurts his eyes. \u201cI like when you do that,\u201d Aziraphale says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d</p>",

Not how I want to eat every day, mind, but it&rsquo;s good for a change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the wine was good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I picked it up in Italy&hellip;oh, a few years back.&rdquo;</p><p>They pack up the leavings of their lunch, looking more like choreographed dancers than picnickers.</p><p>Actually, they look like an angel and a demon who have spent six thousand years dancing around each other, each trying to work the other out. Maybe it <i>is</i> choreography.</p><p>Since the not end of the world they&rsquo;ve fallen into a bit of a pattern: lunch dates (though neither of them dares call what they&rsquo;re doing &ldquo;dating&rdquo;), evenings in Aziraphale&rsquo;s back room or watching Crowley&rsquo;s telly (Crowley introduces Aziraphale to a great many movies, and is taken aback by the angel&rsquo;s overwhelming addiction to <i>Star Wars</i>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s light vs. dark!&rdquo; he says, eyebrows lifted high.), &nbsp;going places for fun instead of for work (just last week they&rsquo;d met up in San Francisco, and after sunset Crowley had flicked his wrist and covered the Golden Gate Bridge with a rainbow of colored lights. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for the pretty decorations,&rdquo; he insists. &ldquo;Just think of the electricity that&rsquo;s using up.&rdquo; Aziraphale smiles knowingly, mutters &ldquo;who&rsquo;s the soft one now?&rdquo; under his breath.).</p><p>Their dance brings them closer to each other every day.</p><p>Is it possible for the not quite end of the world to bring a beginning instead?</p><p>Back at the car, Aziraphale&rsquo;s face lights up with sudden inspiration. &ldquo;Do you think I could, ah, drive?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley&rsquo;s face remains unreadable. The sunglasses help with this, of course, but he&rsquo;s become formidable at schooling his features over the millenia. &ldquo;Drive?&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;The Bentley?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You always make it look like so much fun. And it&rsquo;s been such a lovely day&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Thankful that the sunglasses hide his eyeroll, Crowley says, &ldquo;Stop, stop. Don&rsquo;t look at me like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With your eyes all wide and impossible to say no to.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale takes a little hop-step toward the car, and then another. &ldquo;Is that a yes?&rdquo; He sounds rather like a small child asking if it&rsquo;s time to cut his birthday cake.</p><p>&ldquo;Slow down, angel. We&rsquo;re going to find a nice empty car park for you to practice in, alright? I haven&rsquo;t seen you drive once, and it&rsquo;s been over a century since the automobile was invented.&rdquo;</p><p>Crestfallen, Aziraphale mumbles, &ldquo;I drove the motorbike.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley actually snorts. &ldquo;That was Madame Tracy driving, and you know it. You just miracled it to go faster.&rdquo;</p><p>Aziraphale looks at his toes. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley opens the passenger door and ushers Aziraphale into the car. &ldquo;Now, come on, don&rsquo;t pout. You can give it a go. Just, well, not here. Too many trees. And cars.&rdquo; A duck splashes on the pond. &ldquo;And ducks.&rdquo; He shuts the door and saunters around to the other side.</p><p>. + . + . + .</p><p>He&rsquo;s trying. He really is trying. But Aziraphale is not helping.</p><p>&ldquo;What does this button do, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Headlamps. But it&rsquo;s daylight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right. And this one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the radio. I think you should just focus on driving and let me deal with the music. Or better yet, we leave it off and minimize your distractions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s the radio, Aziraphale. I&rsquo;ve seen you work it before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It looks different from over here!&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley groans.</p><p>Aziraphale runs his hands over the steering wheel. &ldquo;Which pedal makes us go again?&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley goes the kind of still you don&rsquo;t generally find in living things, and Aziraphale titters. &ldquo;Just a joke.&rdquo; He looks at his feet. &ldquo;Mostly.&rdquo;</p><p>Crowley groans.</p><p>But then he looks at Aziraphale again. He&rsquo;s sitting contentedly in the driver&rsquo;s seat, taking everything in, touching all the levers and buttons, resting his palms on the steering wheel.
