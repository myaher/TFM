        "body": "<p><i>You don&rsquo;t have to be a hero to save the world</i></p><p><i>It doesn&rsquo;t make you a narcissist to love yourself</i></p><p><i>It feels like nothing is easy it&rsquo;ll never be</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s alright, let it out, talk to me</i></p><p>Tony let out a shaky breath as he slumped against his workbench. He could try his hardest to do good, to be good, but nothing would ever erase his past of destruction and death. He could never forget it, either, the news certainly would never let him forget. He was tired of being crucified for everything. The things he did do and the things he didn\u2019t do, it was always his fault. Today he wasn\u2019t fast enough, an innocent life was lost. Another family, torn apart because he wasn\u2019t good enough. Cap had told him to evacuate the building sooner, but Clint needed evac off the roof of the same building that was half collapsed already and going down faster than he could run. Tony, of course, caught him and dropped him off on the ground safely. He looped back around to get the rest of the civilians out of the top floor. He got all but one. And the headlines read \u201cIronman left man for dead\u201d and \u201cTony Stark heartless in the face of destruction\u201d. Instead of going to medical to get his ribs tapped and head checked out, he went straight to the lab to watch the news. It didn\u2019t matter that he saved over 15 people from the building or that he blasted that weeks monster in the face or stayed as long as he could to help pick up the pieces or that he\u2019s giving thousands of dollars towards rebuilding the city and individual funds for people who lost their property or loved ones. Someone was dead because of him. </p><p>\u201cJarvis, find out who it was that was lost in the building and make sure all funeral expenses are covered.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d </p><p>The lab doors slid open silently. Tony was aware that someone came in and sat next to him, he just didn\u2019t bother looking at who it was. </p><p>\u201cYou should go to medical, solnyshko.\u201d Bucky, of course.</p><p>\u201cI should have saved him.\u201d Bucky didn\u2019t say anything else, just held him until his voice was raw from screaming and sobbing. </p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t have to be a prodigy to be unique</i></p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t have to know what to say or what to think</i></p><p><i>You don&rsquo;t have to be anybody you can never be</i></p><p><i>That&rsquo;s alright, let it out, talk to me</i></p><p>Tony stumbled, slightly, into the communal kitchen clutching his favorite Star Wars mug after 48 straight hours spent in the lab upgrading the teams equipment and getting back-logged work for SI done. He was the equivalent of a zombie at this point. Eyes blurring slightly, shaky legs and the pounding headache that usually accompany these binges. He went right to the coffee pot to pour himself some sweet, sweet caffeine. </p><p>\u201cStark, are you finished with those stun arrows yet?\u201d Clint dropped down from the top of the fridge effectively scaring Tony so bad that the boiling hot coffee sloshed over his hand. </p><p>\u201cJesus! Clint you\u2019re going to kill me one of these days.\u201d Tony hissed as he wiped his burnt hand on his shirt. </p><p>Clint shrugged. \u201cArrows?\u201d Tony shook his head, he still hasn\u2019t managed to get the voltage correct. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were some super genius and you can\u2019t figure out these arrows?\u201d </p><p>Did Tony say that out loud? Maybe he isn\u2019t as recovered from that concussion as he thought if he\u2019s speaking without realizing it. He also might need sleep soon. Clint snorted. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame a concussion for you not thinking before you speak. That\u2019s just a Stark thing, no filter.\u201d Tony, for once, had nothing to say. So he just blinked at Clint and then put his mug in the sink. He\u2019ll get coffee somewhere else. He turned to flee the kitchen with a heavy feeling in his chest. But before he could step out completely he stopped and said:</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Birdbrain, I\u2019ll get your arrows finished.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back into the elevator to go back down to the lab. </p><p>\u201cSir, I would recommend that you sleep for at least 10 hours, not go back to the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard Legolas, arrows, J. To the lab.\u201d Jarvis didn\u2019t respond other than to start the elevator down. Tony let out a sigh, in reality nothing sounded better than face planting into his bed. Who needs sleep when your team needs gear to keep them safe? Not Tony, that&rsquo;s for sure. Howard Stark only cared about himself, a bottle of scotch, and Captain America. Tony cares about a hell of a lot more than that and he&rsquo;ll be damned if he\u2019ll let sleep drag him down. He stood up a little straighter and rolled his shoulders. He could do this, arrows and then sleep. Tony stepped back into the lab and got to work. </p><p>Turns out, he cannot do this. He has been shocked and burnt more times in the last hour than he has in the last month alone. With a frustrated growl he swiped the contents off the desk onto the floor. Taking in the state of his red and raw hands, he clenched them into fists. The pain made him focus, clearing the haziness in his mind. He jumped violently when hands connected with his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cShh. I think it\u2019s time you get up to bed.\u201d Tony\u2019s anxiety lessened upon hearing Bucky\u2019s voice and almost completely vanished when he started to rub circles into the hard knots within Tony\u2019s shoulders. He didn\u2019t register that they were walking out of the lab until the doors opened. Tony jerked out of Bucky\u2019s hold. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Bucko, I have work to do.\u201d Tony gave him a forced smile and he couldn\u2019t quite name the emotion that came over Bucky\u2019s face. Almost disappointment, but sadder. That\u2019s okay, Tony knew he was a disappointment. </p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve been up almost 40 hours straight. You need sleep, not to mention medical attention.\u201d </p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t meet his gaze, instead looking at the mess in his lab. The blueprints for Clint\u2019s arrows and their failed prototypes littered on the floor. </p><p>\u201cClint needs arrows.\u201d It was said without any malice, just defeat. This shouldn\u2019t be so hard, he was a genius for fucks sake. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Bucky waited until the inventor looked at him, \u201cit\u2019s hard because you need sleep and food. Clint\u2019s arrows can wait until you\u2019ve slept, gotten food, and your hands looked at. And if he says anything about it, I\u2019ll kick his ass. C\u2019mon, solnyshko, let me take care of you.\u201d </p><p><i>Anxiety tossing turning in your sleep</i></p><p><i>Even if you run away you still see them in your dreams</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s so dark tonight but you&rsquo;ll survive certainly</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s alright, come inside, and talk to me</i></p><p>Tony slept for exactly four hours and 17 minutes. He woke up with a scream dying on his lips and sweat soaking through his shirt. Apparently, even sleep deprived, his mind was still a cruel bastard. His shirt felt like a wet noose slowly making its way up to his neck. He could feel his ridiculously soft sheets beneath him, but his mind was screaming that he was on rocky and hard ground. Tony tumbled out of the bed onto the floor while gasping for breath. He couldn\u2019t hear Jarvis telling him where he was, what time it was or the weather outside. All he could hear were bombs going off and his harsh breathing. Tony clawed off his shirt, not registering that his hands were wrapped and he tapped the arc reactor rapidly as the walls of his room closed in on him.</p><p><i>We can talk here on the floor</i></p><p><i>On the phone, if you prefer</i></p><p><i>I&rsquo;ll be here until you&rsquo;re okay</i></p><p>Jarvis must\u2019ve alerted Bucky to Tony\u2019s panic attack because he was suddenly there grabbing his hands gently. </p><p>\u201cTony, hey, it\u2019s alright. Can you try to match my breathing? In and out.\u201d Bucky placed both of Tony\u2019s hands on his chest, exaggerating his breathing in an attempt to calm Tony\u2019s own rapid breathing. It took awhile, but eventually Tony sagged and calmed down. Bucky moved so he could pull Tony into his lap.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want me to, doll.\u201d \u00a0</p><p><i>Let your words release your pain</i></p><p><i>You and I will share the weight</i></p><p><i>Growing stronger day by day</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bucky lowered the book he was reading to peer up at Tony. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tony repeated with a little exasperation leaking into his voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite. What for, solnyshko?\u201d Tony started tapping the arc reactor casing gently. </p><p>\u201cBeing a mess.\u201d Bucky arched an eyebrow and reached forward to snag one of Tony\u2019s wrists to pull him down into his lap. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, doll, but you\u2019re talking to a man who&rsquo;s had his brains scrambled for the last 70 years.\u201d Tony huffed and looked away.</p><p>\u201cBut you handle it so well.\u201d Bucky snorted</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not really. Sometimes I wake up still feeling like the Asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wake up feeling like I\u2019m still hooked up to a car battery.\u201d Tony leaned on Bucky\u2019s chest and Bucky held him closer. </p><p>\u201cLooks like we both have burdens to bare. Not alone, though. Not anymore.\u201d </p><p><i>It&rsquo;s so dark outside tonight</i></p><p><i>Build a fire warm and bright</i></p><p><i>And the wind it howls and bites</i></p><p><i>Bite it back with all your might</i></p><p>Bucky found Tony on the roof. It was the dead of night and slightly chilly and why on earth was Tony even out here? </p><p>\u201cI hate it, you know?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice made Bucky\u2019s steps falter. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Bucky walked the distance to Tony and sat down next to the man who hadn\u2019t looked at him once. </p><p>\u201cI hate that I can never take back all of the things I did. I was an awful person, still might be an awful person. But I try, yeah? I give pieces of myself away in hopes that that will rectify the things I\u2019ve done. But I\u2019ve realized that don\u2019t have anything left, nothing good enough anyways, and I\u2019m just so damn tired.\u201d Bucky took a moment to look at Tony, not that he hadn\u2019t already committed this man to his memory, but he did see how tired he was. Dark circles under his eyes, slumped shoulders, glazed far off stare, and he was so pale. When Bucky spoke he made sure his voice was soft, but firm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never run out of pieces, your body will give them back to you without your consent to keep on giving. Other people will throw them at you, damaged and unclean and then it will be your job to fix them up to give them away again.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes finally drifted to look at Bucky. \u201cSometimes, you&rsquo;ll pick up the fallen and forgotten pieces of yourself and place them next to your heart to never forget who and what they were given to and you will never give those pieces away again. There is no such thing as giving away too many pieces of yourself, you\u2019ll still have them, they may be broken and dirty and old but they are still yours and they are still good enough.\u201d Tony\u2019s tears were silent as he nodded. </p><p>\u201cYou sound so sure.\u201d Bucky looked away, a sad smile dancing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still picking up and polishing off my own pieces.\u201d Tony\u2019s hand moved to rest on top of his and they sat in silence. </p><p><i>Anxiety tossing turning in your sleep</i></p><p><i>Even if you run away you still see them in your dreams</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s so dark tonight</i></p><p><i>It looks nice, fall asleep</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s alright, come inside, and talk to me</i></p><p>\u201cTony, come to bed, doll.\u201d </p><p>And for once, Tony didn\u2019t worry about any nightmares plaguing him in his sleep. He didn\u2019t worry about all the work he still had to do. He didn\u2019t have to worry about his demons clawing their way up from his personal hell when Bucky was there to help him keep them at bay. Tony shut down his work and got up to follow the love of his life to bed. </p>",

He could try his hardest to do good, to be good, but nothing would ever erase his past of destruction and death. He could never forget it, either, the news certainly would never let him forget. He was tired of being crucified for everything. The things he did do and the things he didn\u2019t do, it was always his fault. Today he wasn\u2019t fast enough, an innocent life was lost. Another family, torn apart because he wasn\u2019t good enough. Cap had told him to evacuate the building sooner, but Clint needed evac off the roof of the same building that was half collapsed already and going down faster than he could run. Tony, of course, caught him and dropped him off on the ground safely. He looped back around to get the rest of the civilians out of the top floor. He got all but one. And the headlines read \u201cIronman left man for dead\u201d and \u201cTony Stark heartless in the face of destruction\u201d. Instead of going to medical to get his ribs tapped and head checked out, he went straight to the lab to watch the news. It didn\u2019t matter that he saved over 15 people from the building or that he blasted that weeks monster in the face or stayed as long as he could to help pick up the pieces or that he\u2019s giving thousands of dollars towards rebuilding the city and individual funds for people who lost their property or loved ones. Someone was dead because of him. </p><p>\u201cJarvis, find out who it was that was lost in the building and make sure all funeral expenses are covered.\u201d </p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d </p><p>The lab doors slid open silently. Tony was aware that someone came in and sat next to him, he just didn\u2019t bother looking at who it was. </p><p>\u201cYou should go to medical, solnyshko.\u201d Bucky, of course.</p><p>\u201cI should have saved him.\u201d Bucky didn\u2019t say anything else, just held him until his voice was raw from screaming and sobbing. </p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to be a prodigy to be unique</i></p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to know what to say or what to think</i></p><p><i>You don\u2019t have to be anybody you can never be</i></p><p><i>That\u2019s alright, let it out, talk to me</i></p><p>Tony stumbled, slightly, into the communal kitchen clutching his favorite Star Wars mug after 48 straight hours spent in the lab upgrading the teams equipment and getting back-logged work for SI done. He was the equivalent of a zombie at this point. Eyes blurring slightly, shaky legs and the pounding headache that usually accompany these binges. He went right to the coffee pot to pour himself some sweet, sweet caffeine. </p><p>\u201cStark, are you finished with those stun arrows yet?\u201d Clint dropped down from the top of the fridge effectively scaring Tony so bad that the boiling hot coffee sloshed over his hand. </p><p>\u201cJesus! Clint you\u2019re going to kill me one of these days.\u201d Tony hissed as he wiped his burnt hand on his shirt. </p><p>Clint shrugged. \u201cArrows?\u201d Tony shook his head, he still hasn\u2019t managed to get the voltage correct. </p><p>\u201cI thought you were some super genius and you can\u2019t figure out these arrows?\u201d </p><p>Did Tony say that out loud? Maybe he isn\u2019t as recovered from that concussion as he thought if he\u2019s speaking without realizing it. He also might need sleep soon. Clint snorted. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame a concussion for you not thinking before you speak. That\u2019s just a Stark thing, no filter.\u201d Tony, for once, had nothing to say. So he just blinked at Clint and then put his mug in the sink. He\u2019ll get coffee somewhere else. He turned to flee the kitchen with a heavy feeling in his chest. But before he could step out completely he stopped and said:</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Birdbrain, I\u2019ll get your arrows finished.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back into the elevator to go back down to the lab. </p><p>\u201cSir, I would recommend that you sleep for at least 10 hours, not go back to the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard Legolas, arrows, J. To the lab.\u201d Jarvis didn\u2019t respond other than to start the elevator down. Tony let out a sigh, in reality nothing sounded better than face planting into his bed. Who needs sleep when your team needs gear to keep them safe? Not Tony, that\u2019s for sure. Howard Stark only cared about himself, a bottle of scotch, and Captain America. Tony cares about a hell of a lot more than that and he\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019ll let sleep drag him down. He stood up a little straighter and rolled his shoulders. He could do this, arrows and then sleep. Tony stepped back into the lab and got to work. </p><p>Turns out, he cannot do this. He has been shocked and burnt more times in the last hour than he has in the last month alone. With a frustrated growl he swiped the contents off the desk onto the floor. Taking in the state of his red and raw hands, he clenched them into fists. The pain made him focus, clearing the haziness in his mind. He jumped violently when hands connected with his shoulders. </p><p>\u201cShh. I think it\u2019s time you get up to bed.\u201d Tony\u2019s anxiety lessened upon hearing Bucky\u2019s voice and almost completely vanished when he started to rub circles into the hard knots within Tony\u2019s shoulders. He didn\u2019t register that they were walking out of the lab until the doors opened. Tony jerked out of Bucky\u2019s hold. </p><p>\u201cSorry, Bucko, I have work to do.\u201d Tony gave him a forced smile and he couldn\u2019t quite name the emotion that came over Bucky\u2019s face. Almost disappointment, but sadder. That\u2019s okay, Tony knew he was a disappointment. </p><p>\u201cTony, you\u2019ve been up almost 40 hours straight. You need sleep, not to mention medical attention.\u201d </p><p>Tony couldn\u2019t meet his gaze, instead looking at the mess in his lab. The blueprints for Clint\u2019s arrows and their failed prototypes littered on the floor. </p><p>\u201cClint needs arrows.\u201d It was said without any malice, just defeat. This shouldn\u2019t be so hard, he was a genius for fucks sake. </p><p>\u201cTony,\u201d Bucky waited until the inventor looked at him, \u201cit\u2019s hard because you need sleep and food. Clint\u2019s arrows can wait until you\u2019ve slept, gotten food, and your hands looked at. And if he says anything about it, I\u2019ll kick his ass. C\u2019mon, solnyshko, let me take care of you.\u201d </p><p><i>Anxiety tossing turning in your sleep</i></p><p><i>Even if you run away you still see them in your dreams</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s so dark tonight but you\u2019ll survive certainly</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s alright, come inside, and talk to me</i></p><p>Tony slept for exactly four hours and 17 minutes. He woke up with a scream dying on his lips and sweat soaking through his shirt. Apparently, even sleep deprived, his mind was still a cruel bastard. His shirt felt like a wet noose slowly making its way up to his neck. He could feel his ridiculously soft sheets beneath him, but his mind was screaming that he was on rocky and hard ground. Tony tumbled out of the bed onto the floor while gasping for breath. He couldn\u2019t hear Jarvis telling him where he was, what time it was or the weather outside. All he could hear were bombs going off and his harsh breathing. Tony clawed off his shirt, not registering that his hands were wrapped and he tapped the arc reactor rapidly as the walls of his room closed in on him.</p><p><i>We can talk here on the floor</i></p><p><i>On the phone, if you prefer</i></p><p><i>I\u2019ll be here until you\u2019re okay</i></p><p>Jarvis must\u2019ve alerted Bucky to Tony\u2019s panic attack because he was suddenly there grabbing his hands gently. </p><p>\u201cTony, hey, it\u2019s alright. Can you try to match my breathing? In and out.\u201d Bucky placed both of Tony\u2019s hands on his chest, exaggerating his breathing in an attempt to calm Tony\u2019s own rapid breathing. It took awhile, but eventually Tony sagged and calmed down. Bucky moved so he could pull Tony into his lap.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want me to, doll.\u201d \u00a0</p><p><i>Let your words release your pain</i></p><p><i>You and I will share the weight</i></p><p><i>Growing stronger day by day</i></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Bucky lowered the book he was reading to peer up at Tony. </p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tony repeated with a little exasperation leaking into his voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite. What for, solnyshko?\u201d Tony started tapping the arc reactor casing gently. </p><p>\u201cBeing a mess.\u201d Bucky arched an eyebrow and reached forward to snag one of Tony\u2019s wrists to pull him down into his lap. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, doll, but you\u2019re talking to a man who\u2019s had his brains scrambled for the last 70 years.\u201d Tony huffed and looked away.</p><p>\u201cBut you handle it so well.\u201d Bucky snorted</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not really. Sometimes I wake up still feeling like the Asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wake up feeling like I\u2019m still hooked up to a car battery.\u201d Tony leaned on Bucky\u2019s chest and Bucky held him closer. </p><p>\u201cLooks like we both have burdens to bare. Not alone, though. Not anymore.\u201d </p><p><i>It\u2019s so dark outside tonight</i></p><p><i>Build a fire warm and bright</i></p><p><i>And the wind it howls and bites</i></p><p><i>Bite it back with all your might</i></p><p>Bucky found Tony on the roof. It was the dead of night and slightly chilly and why on earth was Tony even out here? </p><p>\u201cI hate it, you know?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice made Bucky\u2019s steps falter. After a moment\u2019s hesitation Bucky walked the distance to Tony and sat down next to the man who hadn\u2019t looked at him once. </p><p>\u201cI hate that I can never take back all of the things I did. I was an awful person, still might be an awful person. But I try, yeah? I give pieces of myself away in hopes that that will rectify the things I\u2019ve done. But I\u2019ve realized that don\u2019t have anything left, nothing good enough anyways, and I\u2019m just so damn tired.\u201d Bucky took a moment to look at Tony, not that he hadn\u2019t already committed this man to his memory, but he did see how tired he was. Dark circles under his eyes, slumped shoulders, glazed far off stare, and he was so pale. When Bucky spoke he made sure his voice was soft, but firm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never run out of pieces, your body will give them back to you without your consent to keep on giving. Other people will throw them at you, damaged and unclean and then it will be your job to fix them up to give them away again.\u201d Tony\u2019s eyes finally drifted to look at Bucky. \u201cSometimes, you\u2019ll pick up the fallen and forgotten pieces of yourself and place them next to your heart to never forget who and what they were given to and you will never give those pieces away again. There is no such thing as giving away too many pieces of yourself, you\u2019ll still have them, they may be broken and dirty and old but they are still yours and they are still good enough.\u201d Tony\u2019s tears were silent as he nodded. </p><p>\u201cYou sound so sure.\u201d Bucky looked away, a sad smile dancing on his lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still picking up and polishing off my own pieces.\u201d Tony\u2019s hand moved to rest on top of his and they sat in silence. </p><p><i>Anxiety tossing turning in your sleep</i></p><p><i>Even if you run away you still see them in your dreams</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s so dark tonight</i></p><p><i>It looks nice, fall asleep</i></p><p><i>It\u2019s alright, come inside, and talk to me</i></p><p>\u201cTony, come to bed, doll.\u201d </p><p>And for once, Tony didn\u2019t worry about any nightmares plaguing him in his sleep. He didn\u2019t worry about all the work he still had to do. He didn\u2019t have to worry about his demons clawing their way up from his personal hell when Bucky was there to help him keep them at bay. Tony shut down his work and got up to follow the love of his life to bed. </p>",

Other people will throw them at you, damaged and unclean and then it will be your job to fix them up to give them away again.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s eyes finally drifted to look at Bucky. &ldquo;Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll pick up the fallen and forgotten pieces of yourself and place them next to your heart to never forget who and what they were given to and you will never give those pieces away again. There is no such thing as giving away too many pieces of yourself, you&rsquo;ll still have them, they may be broken and dirty and old but they are still yours and they are still good enough.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s tears were silent as he nodded. </p><p>&ldquo;You sound so sure.&rdquo; Bucky looked away, a sad smile dancing on his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m still picking up and polishing off my own pieces.&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s hand moved to rest on top of his and they sat in silence. </p><p><i>Anxiety tossing turning in your sleep</i></p><p><i>Even if you run away you still see them in your dreams</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s so dark tonight</i></p><p><i>It looks nice, fall asleep</i></p><p><i>It&rsquo;s alright, come inside, and talk to me</i></p><p>&ldquo;Tony, come to bed, doll.&rdquo; </p><p>And for once, Tony didn&rsquo;t worry about any nightmares plaguing him in his sleep. He didn&rsquo;t worry about all the work he still had to do. He didn&rsquo;t have to worry about his demons clawing their way up from his personal hell when Bucky was there to help him keep them at bay. Tony shut down his work and got up to follow the love of his life to bed. </p>",
