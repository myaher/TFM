        "answer": "<p>There are many reasons <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201703/the-psychology-hate\" target=\"_blank\">why we dislike/hate someone</a> and what you mentioned is one of them which is actually referring to the phenomenon called projection.</p><p>\u201c<i>Psychological projection is a defense mechanism people subconsciously \nemploy in order to cope with difficult feelings or emotions. \nPsychological projection involves projecting undesirable feelings or \nemotions onto someone else, rather than admitting to or dealing with the\n unwanted feelings.</i>\u201d [2]<br/></p><p>So because it\u2019s a subconscious defense mechanism, it\u2019s naturally sth that everyone do to an extent. Loki has used projection in situations that he was emotionally distraught and mentally unstable. In Thor 1 Loki projects all of his self-loathing to the Jotuns. Before the revelation about his parentage, unlike Thor, he doesn\u2019t show any intense feelings or hatred toward Jotuns. He uses them in his plan and regards them as inferiors whose lives don\u2019t matter. His mindset is what he has learnt in his society. Then he finds out that he is one of the monsters and he was supposed to be used to bring peace with them. He realizes that he couldn\u2019t ever be worthy in Odin\u2019s eye because of what he is.

This is called neurotic projection where \nyour negative impulses are projected onto others[3]. <br /></p><p>There is another type of projection called complementary projection.</p><p>\n&ldquo;<i>This is a form of projection where one assumes that others share the \nsame opinions, impulses, and thoughts as you, that they are just as \nexcited about a particular issue or angered by an issue as you are.</i>&rdquo; [3]<br /></p><p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m not your brother. I never was.</i>&rdquo;</p><p>This line is complementary projection imo. Loki never says <i>Thor is not his brother</i>. He doesn&rsquo;t disown Thor from himself. <i>He disowns himself from Thor</i>. Loki thinks because of his race, he is not and has never been Thor&rsquo;s brother and equal to him and he believes if Thor finds out he thinks the same. That Loki isn&rsquo;t his brother. So he projects his thought and feeling about the matter on Thor and utter these words before Thor does.<br /></p><p>Loki also uses projection a lot in Avengers. They are not only a sign of the tortures he went through but also shows how the events of the first movie affected his mental state and how deeply he is hurt. There&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://lucianalight.tumblr.com/post/177368731403/do-you-have-any-thoughts-on-lokis-line-freedom\" target=\"_blank\">his line about freedom</a> which is a projection of his life and also his predicament. <a href=\"https://lucianalight.tumblr.com/post/178190948968/lokidlaufeyson-they-are-a-lost-people-how-have-i\" target=\"_blank\">His talk with The Other about people of Earth</a> which is actually a projection of how he feels and what&rsquo;s been done to him. And then <a href=\"https://lucianalight.tumblr.com/post/178154462418/do-you-think-that-what-loki-says-to-natasha-in\" target=\"_blank\">his speech to Natasha</a> that is as much about her as it is about himself.</p><p>In TDW there is also a moment in the boat scene where Loki projects his guilt about Frigga&rsquo;s death on Thor.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Trust? Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>These were all the instances I remember that Loki used projection. I think he has legitimate reasons for his dislike of people in other situations and they&rsquo;re not projection.<br /></p><p><a href=\"https://lucianalight.tumblr.com/post/178604710758/odins-family-dynamic-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">Odin on the other hand is a textbook narcissist</a>. <br /></p><p>\n&ldquo;<i>Narcissists project their own traits, actions, values, fears, fantasies,\n hates, motives, and distorted self-beliefs onto others. People with NPD\n habitually <a href=\"https://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/05/09/the-narcissist-parents-psychological-warfare-parentifying-idealizing-and-scapegoating/\" target=\"_blank\">idealize and scapegoat</a>, assigning either positive or negative traits to those around them.</i>&rdquo; [4]\n\n<br /></p><p>Psychological projection can be negative and positive[3].Thor as the golden child is the projection of everything Odin wishes to see in himself and Loki as the scapegoat \nis the shadow side of the narcissist, representing his underlying feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing\n\n[4]. Also narcissists are renowned for using psychological projection to blame\n other people, even when it is entirely apparent that they are the ones \nin the wrong[5]. So yes, Odin definitely uses projection all the time. He blames Hela for what she&rsquo;d done, for things he had taught her. He projects all his wrongdoings on only her. Just like he blames Loki for everything that happened and just assumes the worst of him without even questioning him what happened to him. So him imprisoning Hela and Loki is because he projects all he doesn&rsquo;t like about himself on them and casting it out.</p><p>Thank you for sending such an interesting ask! :)<br /></p><p><b>Sources:</b></p><p>[1] \n<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nurturing-self-compassion/201703/the-psychology-hate\" target=\"_blank\">The Psychology of Hate <br /></a></p><p>[2] \n<a href=\"https://www.everydayhealth.com/emotional-health/psychological-projection-dealing-with-undesirable-emotions/\" target=\"_blank\">Psychological Projection: Dealing With Undesirable Emotions</a> <br /></p><p>[3] \n<a href=\"https://psychologenie.com/understanding-psychological-projection-theory-with-examples\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding the Psychological Projection Theory With Examples <br /></a></p><p>[4] <a href=\"https://narcissistfamilyfiles.com/2017/10/03/narcissistics-fun-house-mirrors-projection/\" target=\"_blank\">The Narcissist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fun House&rsquo; of Mirrors and Projection</a> <br /></p><p>[5] \n<a href=\"https://www.learning-mind.com/what-is-psychological-projection/\" target=\"_blank\">What is psychological projection?\n\n</a><br /></p>",

In other news, Christmas requests for this year\u2019s 25 Days of Christmas will be opening soon so keep an eye out! I also wanted to thank everyone who made my day by buying me a cup of coffee on <a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/astouract\">ko-fi.com/astouract</a>. It means the world to me! Thank you lovely people!! </p><p>-</p><p>Pushing open the door to your room, you released a sigh you\u2019d been holding onto all evening. You wanted nothing more than to get the makeup off of your face and to slip out of your tight-ass dress. Your heels were the first to come off, lazily tossed onto the floor as a thought popped into your mind. Only, it wasn\u2019t your own. </p><p>\u201c<i>How did it go</i>?\u201d The voice asked, and you instantly knew who it was. </p><p>\u201c<i>The family get-together? Oh, wonderful as usual.</i>\u201d Your jacket was next, shrugged off and thrown onto your bed before you sat down. </p><p>There was silence for a few moments, and a sound in your doorway alerted you to Loki\u2019s presence as you began to pull out bobby pins from your hair.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d He asked smoothly, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest. He wore a grey sweater with black jeans, and you couldn\u2019t help but be a bit jealous about how comfortable he looked. Meanwhile, your arms were going tired from holding them up for so long&ndash; just to search for all the tiny pins. </p><p>Loki chuckled softly, shaking his head at you. \u201cHere, pet, let me help.\u201d He was at your side in seconds, sinking down onto the mattress beside you and tangling his fingers in your hair. One by one he gingerly released each strand, and you leaned back ever-so-slightly into his touch. </p><p>\u201cSo, how was it <i>really</i>?\u201d He asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d You groaned, \u201cTerrible. My mother was even more judgemental than usual, and my father just kept on nodding at everything she said. That\u2019s not even mentioning the rest of my family, half of which thinks I\u2019m lying about my career&ndash;the other half just thinks I\u2019m insane and unstable.\u201d</p><p>Loki let another tuft of hair fall, guiding it down onto your shoulder with his hand. You felt his fingertips on your bare skin, only briefly before he brought them back up. \u201cWhat could there be to be judgemental about?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, suppressing a shiver as his fingers combed through your hair to make sure every pin was out. \u201cThe fact that I dropped every aspiration that they ever had for me, that I quit school and am now living with multiple men&ndash;oh, and they still aren\u2019t over the fact that their daughter is \u2018some kind of mutant.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Loki paused, resting his hands on your shoulders. \u201cThey called you that?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, you let yourself lean back on him completely, welcoming the warmth radiating off of his body. \u201cYeah, not exactly the Parents of the Year, huh?\u201d</p><p>You felt his hands move down to your arms, absentmindedly tracing patterns on your skin. He didn\u2019t say anything, but you knew what he was thinking&ndash;he knew exactly how you felt, and worse. It had taken him a long time to accept himself for who he was, and even now, you knew there was still a part of him that hated it. </p><p>\u201cBut I guess that\u2019s something we have in common.\u201d You stated, willing yourself to get up and open your dresser to look for something more comfortable to wear. You always tried to dress as professional as you could for the family \u201cget-togethers,\u201d in hopes that someone would take you more seriously. </p><p>You glanced back at Loki, who was leaning back against your headboard. His gaze was already focused on you, and you smiled sheepishly as you walked towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Clothes in-hand, you stepped into the bathroom to change. </p><p>The thought of undressing in front of Loki was utterly embarrassing; even though you\u2019d been intimate before, it was always in your head. Your own hand working yourself up to his words in your mind late at night, and vice versa. He\u2019d never seen your body, never touched you&hellip; So getting changed in front of him would be incredibly awkward. </p><p>At least, that was what you thought, until you realized the zipper on the back of the black dress you wore was stuck. With a frustrated groan, you pattered back into your room, your arms contorted to try to get the zipper unstuck yourself. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d You confessed upon seeing Loki\u2019s amused expression. </p><p>He chuckled, rising to his feet and taking his time to get to where you stood. \u201cAnd why should I do that? That dress looks stunning on you.\u201d You heard the humor in his voice, teasing you as his fingers found the zipper. </p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t think it suited me at all.\u201d He released the tiny piece of metal to brush your hair out of the way, and for a moment you wondered if you\u2019d ever get out of the expensive fabric. </p><p>Loki made a low noise, toying with the little mechanism once more. \u201cIt suits you, trust me. Although&hellip;\u201d </p><p>He paused, and you felt him lean over your shoulder until his lips just barely brushed against the shell of your ear. You couldn\u2019t disguise the shiver that ran through your body like electricity, alerting you to every slight move he made. You could feel his breath on your skin, his hair brushing over your bare shoulder. You could <i>feel</i> his arrogant smirk. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather it was green.\u201d</p><p>He returned to his previous stance, skillful fingers working at the stubborn zipper. God, how long could it take to unstick it? </p><p>\u201c<i>Or maybe gold</i>,\u201d his voice said in your mind. </p><p>\u201c<i>Why green and gold</i>?\u201d You responded, and then you understood. They were Loki\u2019s colors. Turning in his arms to face him, he dropped his hands back to his sides. Something mischievous sparkled in his green eyes as he studied you, as if expecting something from you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You questioned. </p><p>He took a step forward, leading you backwards. \u201cWaiting on you, pet.\u201d</p><p>You gaped stupidly at him, your heart about to beat out of your chest. \u201cWaiting for what?\u201d Another step backwards, and you came into contact with the wall. </p><p>He smiled sweetly, as if you were no more than a naive child. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how often you think about me? Us?\u201d His hands moved to settle on your waist. \u201cI hear every thought like a prayer. Every wish, every daydream, every&hellip; Fantasy.\u201d </p><p>You took in a shaky breath, trying to calm yourself down through the longing in the pit of your stomach. His thumbs slipped under the hem of your shirt, and one of his legs went between yours. \u201cAnd this is one of them&hellip; Isn\u2019t it?\u201d He asked lowly. </p><p>Your gaze flickered from his eyes to his pink lips, and you had to restrain yourself from tangling your fingers in his hair. It wasn\u2019t slicked back like it so often was, it was soft and wavy and <i>perfect</i>. The corners of his lips turned upwards in a superior grin, as if he\u2019d heard your impulsive thoughts, and he twisted on his heel to leave. </p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just keep on waiting, then.\u201d Loki\u2019s gaze dragged down your body, and you involuntarily released a quiet whimper as he ghosted his fingertips across your stomach. </p><p>\u201cBut that isn\u2019t what you really want&hellip; Is it?\u201d He asked lowly.</p><p>Gulping down your hesitation, you shook your head. \u201cNo,\u201d You confessed, snaking an arm up to grip the neck of his sweater, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d </p><p>Before you could think your way out of it, you tugged him close and his lips crashed onto your own.

In other news, Christmas requests for this year\u2019s 25 Days of Christmas will be opening soon so keep an eye out! I also wanted to thank everyone who made my day by buying me a cup of coffee on <a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/astouract\">ko-fi.com/astouract</a>. It means the world to me! Thank you lovely people!! </p><p>-</p><p>Pushing open the door to your room, you released a sigh you\u2019d been holding onto all evening. You wanted nothing more than to get the makeup off of your face and to slip out of your tight-ass dress. Your heels were the first to come off, lazily tossed onto the floor as a thought popped into your mind. Only, it wasn\u2019t your own. </p><p>\u201c<i>How did it go</i>?\u201d The voice asked, and you instantly knew who it was. </p><p>\u201c<i>The family get-together? Oh, wonderful as usual.</i>\u201d Your jacket was next, shrugged off and thrown onto your bed before you sat down. </p><p>There was silence for a few moments, and a sound in your doorway alerted you to Loki\u2019s presence as you began to pull out bobby pins from your hair.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d He asked smoothly, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest. He wore a grey sweater with black jeans, and you couldn\u2019t help but be a bit jealous about how comfortable he looked. Meanwhile, your arms were going tired from holding them up for so long\u2013 just to search for all the tiny pins. </p><p>Loki chuckled softly, shaking his head at you. \u201cHere, pet, let me help.\u201d He was at your side in seconds, sinking down onto the mattress beside you and tangling his fingers in your hair. One by one he gingerly released each strand, and you leaned back ever-so-slightly into his touch. </p><p>\u201cSo, how was it <i>really</i>?\u201d He asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d You groaned, \u201cTerrible. My mother was even more judgemental than usual, and my father just kept on nodding at everything she said. That\u2019s not even mentioning the rest of my family, half of which thinks I\u2019m lying about my career\u2013the other half just thinks I\u2019m insane and unstable.\u201d</p><p>Loki let another tuft of hair fall, guiding it down onto your shoulder with his hand. You felt his fingertips on your bare skin, only briefly before he brought them back up. \u201cWhat could there be to be judgemental about?\u201d</p><p>You shrugged, suppressing a shiver as his fingers combed through your hair to make sure every pin was out. \u201cThe fact that I dropped every aspiration that they ever had for me, that I quit school and am now living with multiple men\u2013oh, and they still aren\u2019t over the fact that their daughter is \u2018some kind of mutant.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Loki paused, resting his hands on your shoulders. \u201cThey called you that?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, you let yourself lean back on him completely, welcoming the warmth radiating off of his body. \u201cYeah, not exactly the Parents of the Year, huh?\u201d</p><p>You felt his hands move down to your arms, absentmindedly tracing patterns on your skin. He didn\u2019t say anything, but you knew what he was thinking\u2013he knew exactly how you felt, and worse. It had taken him a long time to accept himself for who he was, and even now, you knew there was still a part of him that hated it. </p><p>\u201cBut I guess that\u2019s something we have in common.\u201d You stated, willing yourself to get up and open your dresser to look for something more comfortable to wear. You always tried to dress as professional as you could for the family \u201cget-togethers,\u201d in hopes that someone would take you more seriously. </p><p>You glanced back at Loki, who was leaning back against your headboard. His gaze was already focused on you, and you smiled sheepishly as you walked towards the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Clothes in-hand, you stepped into the bathroom to change. </p><p>The thought of undressing in front of Loki was utterly embarrassing; even though you\u2019d been intimate before, it was always in your head. Your own hand working yourself up to his words in your mind late at night, and vice versa. He\u2019d never seen your body, never touched you\u2026 So getting changed in front of him would be incredibly awkward. </p><p>At least, that was what you thought, until you realized the zipper on the back of the black dress you wore was stuck. With a frustrated groan, you pattered back into your room, your arms contorted to try to get the zipper unstuck yourself. </p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d You confessed upon seeing Loki\u2019s amused expression. </p><p>He chuckled, rising to his feet and taking his time to get to where you stood. \u201cAnd why should I do that? That dress looks stunning on you.\u201d You heard the humor in his voice, teasing you as his fingers found the zipper. </p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t think it suited me at all.\u201d He released the tiny piece of metal to brush your hair out of the way, and for a moment you wondered if you\u2019d ever get out of the expensive fabric. </p><p>Loki made a low noise, toying with the little mechanism once more. \u201cIt suits you, trust me. Although\u2026\u201d </p><p>He paused, and you felt him lean over your shoulder until his lips just barely brushed against the shell of your ear. You couldn\u2019t disguise the shiver that ran through your body like electricity, alerting you to every slight move he made. You could feel his breath on your skin, his hair brushing over your bare shoulder. You could <i>feel</i> his arrogant smirk. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather it was green.\u201d</p><p>He returned to his previous stance, skillful fingers working at the stubborn zipper. God, how long could it take to unstick it? </p><p>\u201c<i>Or maybe gold</i>,\u201d his voice said in your mind. </p><p>\u201c<i>Why green and gold</i>?\u201d You responded, and then you understood. They were Loki\u2019s colors. Turning in his arms to face him, he dropped his hands back to his sides. Something mischievous sparkled in his green eyes as he studied you, as if expecting something from you. </p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You questioned. </p><p>He took a step forward, leading you backwards. \u201cWaiting on you, pet.\u201d</p><p>You gaped stupidly at him, your heart about to beat out of your chest. \u201cWaiting for what?\u201d Another step backwards, and you came into contact with the wall. </p><p>He smiled sweetly, as if you were no more than a naive child. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know how often you think about me? Us?\u201d His hands moved to settle on your waist. \u201cI hear every thought like a prayer. Every wish, every daydream, every\u2026 Fantasy.\u201d </p><p>You took in a shaky breath, trying to calm yourself down through the longing in the pit of your stomach. His thumbs slipped under the hem of your shirt, and one of his legs went between yours. \u201cAnd this is one of them\u2026 Isn\u2019t it?\u201d He asked lowly. </p><p>Your gaze flickered from his eyes to his pink lips, and you had to restrain yourself from tangling your fingers in his hair. It wasn\u2019t slicked back like it so often was, it was soft and wavy and <i>perfect</i>. The corners of his lips turned upwards in a superior grin, as if he\u2019d heard your impulsive thoughts, and he twisted on his heel to leave. </p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just keep on waiting, then.\u201d Loki\u2019s gaze dragged down your body, and you involuntarily released a quiet whimper as he ghosted his fingertips across your stomach. </p><p>\u201cBut that isn\u2019t what you really want\u2026 Is it?\u201d He asked lowly.</p><p>Gulping down your hesitation, you shook your head. \u201cNo,\u201d You confessed, snaking an arm up to grip the neck of his sweater, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d </p><p>Before you could think your way out of it, you tugged him close and his lips crashed onto your own. He tasted of mint, and something sweet, and <i>goddamn</i> he knew what he was doing. One hand pinned you to the wall, while the other cunningly traveled up your torso to cup your bare breasts. </p><p>\u201cHad you anticipated this?\u201d He asked against the skin on your neck, groaning lowly in response to your soft whimpers.</p><p>It was a mess of lips and hands, his mouth on your jawline driving you mad as he rolled his hips into yours.

In other news, Christmas requests for this year&rsquo;s 25 Days of Christmas will be opening soon so keep an eye out! I also wanted to thank everyone who made my day by buying me a cup of coffee on <a href=\"http://ko-fi.com/astouract\">ko-fi.com/astouract</a>. It means the world to me! Thank you lovely people!! </p><p>-</p><p>Pushing open the door to your room, you released a sigh you&rsquo;d been holding onto all evening. You wanted nothing more than to get the makeup off of your face and to slip out of your tight-ass dress. Your heels were the first to come off, lazily tossed onto the floor as a thought popped into your mind. Only, it wasn&rsquo;t your own. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>How did it go</i>?&rdquo; The voice asked, and you instantly knew who it was. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>The family get-together? Oh, wonderful as usual.</i>&rdquo; Your jacket was next, shrugged off and thrown onto your bed before you sat down. </p><p>There was silence for a few moments, and a sound in your doorway alerted you to Loki&rsquo;s presence as you began to pull out bobby pins from your hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Want to talk about it?&rdquo; He asked smoothly, leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest. He wore a grey sweater with black jeans, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but be a bit jealous about how comfortable he looked. Meanwhile, your arms were going tired from holding them up for so long&ndash; just to search for all the tiny pins. </p><p>Loki chuckled softly, shaking his head at you. &ldquo;Here, pet, let me help.&rdquo; He was at your side in seconds, sinking down onto the mattress beside you and tangling his fingers in your hair. One by one he gingerly released each strand, and you leaned back ever-so-slightly into his touch. </p><p>&ldquo;So, how was it <i>really</i>?&rdquo; He asked softly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my God,&rdquo; You groaned, &ldquo;Terrible. My mother was even more judgemental than usual, and my father just kept on nodding at everything she said. That&rsquo;s not even mentioning the rest of my family, half of which thinks I&rsquo;m lying about my career&ndash;the other half just thinks I&rsquo;m insane and unstable.&rdquo;</p><p>Loki let another tuft of hair fall, guiding it down onto your shoulder with his hand. You felt his fingertips on your bare skin, only briefly before he brought them back up. &ldquo;What could there be to be judgemental about?&rdquo;</p><p>You shrugged, suppressing a shiver as his fingers combed through your hair to make sure every pin was out. &ldquo;The fact that I dropped every aspiration that they ever had for me, that I quit school and am now living with multiple men&ndash;oh, and they still aren&rsquo;t over the fact that their daughter is &lsquo;some kind of mutant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Loki paused, resting his hands on your shoulders. &ldquo;They called you that?&rdquo;</p><p>Nodding, you let yourself lean back on him completely, welcoming the warmth radiating off of his body. &ldquo;Yeah, not exactly the Parents of the Year, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>You felt his hands move down to your arms, absentmindedly tracing patterns on your skin. He didn&rsquo;t say anything, but you knew what he was thinking&ndash;he knew exactly how you felt, and worse. It had taken him a long time to accept himself for who he was, and even now, you knew there was still a part of him that hated it. </p><p>&ldquo;But I guess that&rsquo;s something we have in common.&rdquo; You stated, willing yourself to get up and open your dresser to look for something more comfortable to wear. You always tried to dress as professional as you could for the family &ldquo;get-togethers,&rdquo; in hopes that someone would take you more seriously. </p><p>You glanced back at Loki, who was leaning back against your headboard. His gaze was already focused on you, and you smiled sheepishly as you walked towards the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo; Clothes in-hand, you stepped into the bathroom to change. </p><p>The thought of undressing in front of Loki was utterly embarrassing; even though you&rsquo;d been intimate before, it was always in your head. Your own hand working yourself up to his words in your mind late at night, and vice versa. He&rsquo;d never seen your body, never touched you&hellip; So getting changed in front of him would be incredibly awkward. </p><p>At least, that was what you thought, until you realized the zipper on the back of the black dress you wore was stuck. With a frustrated groan, you pattered back into your room, your arms contorted to try to get the zipper unstuck yourself. </p><p>&ldquo;I need your help,&rdquo; You confessed upon seeing Loki&rsquo;s amused expression. </p><p>He chuckled, rising to his feet and taking his time to get to where you stood. &ldquo;And why should I do that? That dress looks stunning on you.&rdquo; You heard the humor in his voice, teasing you as his fingers found the zipper. </p><p>&ldquo;Really? I didn&rsquo;t think it suited me at all.&rdquo; He released the tiny piece of metal to brush your hair out of the way, and for a moment you wondered if you&rsquo;d ever get out of the expensive fabric. </p><p>Loki made a low noise, toying with the little mechanism once more. &ldquo;It suits you, trust me. Although&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p>He paused, and you felt him lean over your shoulder until his lips just barely brushed against the shell of your ear. You couldn&rsquo;t disguise the shiver that ran through your body like electricity, alerting you to every slight move he made. You could feel his breath on your skin, his hair brushing over your bare shoulder. You could <i>feel</i> his arrogant smirk. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather it was green.&rdquo;</p><p>He returned to his previous stance, skillful fingers working at the stubborn zipper. God, how long could it take to unstick it? </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Or maybe gold</i>,&rdquo; his voice said in your mind. </p><p>&ldquo;<i>Why green and gold</i>?&rdquo; You responded, and then you understood. They were Loki&rsquo;s colors. Turning in his arms to face him, he dropped his hands back to his sides. Something mischievous sparkled in his green eyes as he studied you, as if expecting something from you. </p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; You questioned. </p><p>He took a step forward, leading you backwards. &ldquo;Waiting on you, pet.&rdquo;</p><p>You gaped stupidly at him, your heart about to beat out of your chest. &ldquo;Waiting for what?&rdquo; Another step backwards, and you came into contact with the wall. </p><p>He smiled sweetly, as if you were no more than a naive child. &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t know how often you think about me? Us?&rdquo; His hands moved to settle on your waist. &ldquo;I hear every thought like a prayer. Every wish, every daydream, every&hellip; Fantasy.&rdquo; </p><p>You took in a shaky breath, trying to calm yourself down through the longing in the pit of your stomach. His thumbs slipped under the hem of your shirt, and one of his legs went between yours. &ldquo;And this is one of them&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He asked lowly. </p><p>Your gaze flickered from his eyes to his pink lips, and you had to restrain yourself from tangling your fingers in his hair. It wasn&rsquo;t slicked back like it so often was, it was soft and wavy and <i>perfect</i>. The corners of his lips turned upwards in a superior grin, as if he&rsquo;d heard your impulsive thoughts, and he twisted on his heel to leave. </p><p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll just keep on waiting, then.&rdquo; Loki&rsquo;s gaze dragged down your body, and you involuntarily released a quiet whimper as he ghosted his fingertips across your stomach. </p><p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t what you really want&hellip; Is it?&rdquo; He asked lowly.</p><p>Gulping down your hesitation, you shook your head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; You confessed, snaking an arm up to grip the neck of his sweater, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; </p><p>Before you could think your way out of it, you tugged him close and his lips crashed onto your own.
