You weren&rsquo;t sure what it was, but it was a habit you had ever since you were in high school. However, something felt off when you woke up. You looked to the space on the bed next to you, frowning when you saw that it was empty. Of course, your husband was down in the lab again. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You had been married to Tony for years, and you knew that he had a habit of staying up late in his lab when he was depressed or anxious, or his PTSD was affecting him. So, you got up and slipped on a sweater to help fight off the cold air, and you got in the elevator, taking it down to his lab. Once you were down into his lab and the doors opened, you stepped into the lab and looked around to see if you could find Tony. He was sitting at one of the tables, a pencil in his hand and a cup of coffee in the other, heavy bags under his eyes. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He didn&rsquo;t even bother to look up at you, being too focused on his work as his hand-scribbled lines and messy notes on the paper, hunched over the table. Walking over to him, you wrapped your arms around his stomach and laid your head on his shoulder. &ldquo;Hey, baby.&rdquo; You whispered, sitting up straight as he did. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo;<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I know.&ldquo; Tony sighed a bit, finishing off his cup off coffee and setting his pencil down. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;How much coffee have you had?&rdquo; You asked, kissing his neck affectionately. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m on my second pot.&ldquo; Tony looked down at his work. &quot;I&rsquo;m almost done, I&rsquo;ll go to bed when it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo; Drowsy was dripping from his voice. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Then I&rsquo;ll stay up with you.&ldquo; You knew that Tony didn&rsquo;t like when his sleeping habits affected yours, and you staying up was a good attempt to getting him to go to bed with you. \u00a0<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No- I&rsquo;ll be fine. You should go back to bed.&rdquo; Tony leaned back a little into your touch. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll go back to bed when you do.&ldquo; You kissed the back of his neck. &quot;You need sleep.&rdquo; Tony let out a sigh and turned to face you. His eyes were droopy and the bags under his eyes looked even worse up front. You kissed the corner of Tony&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Come to bed with me, honey. Your work will be here in the morning.&rdquo; <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;But I&rsquo;m almost finished with it.&ldquo; He seemed to be holding back a bit, leaning against the table. You pulled him down into a tight hug, running your fingers through his hair. He wrapped his arms around you and nuzzled into your neck. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Tell me what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; You whispered, kissing the top of his head. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m worried if I sleep, I&rsquo;ll have a bad dream.&ldquo; He whispered, his hands a little shaky as he gripped onto you. <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Even if you have a bad dream, I&rsquo;m right here for you. You&rsquo;re safe with me.&rdquo; You continued to run your fingers through his hair, his other hand rubbing his back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo; After a few minutes, Tony pulled back and smiled down at you before looking up and yawning. You chuckled a little and kissed his cheek and grabbed his hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head to bed.&rdquo; Tony nodded and linked your fingers together. The two of you walked together to the elevator and went to your bedroom together. You slipped off your sweater and slid into bed, Tony taking off his pants and his shirt and crawling under the blanket next to you. He wrapped his arms around your waist and laid his head on your stomach. Soon enough, the two of you passed out together, holding each other close. <br/></p>",

Rhodey follows it, sucking in air, breaking out in a coughing fit when his lungs actually get air. </p><p>&ldquo;There we go. Copy me.&rdquo; </p><p>A hand, threading through his, pressing it against a chest. He picks up the scent of hot metal. Tony. The breath out is loud and pointed, and Rhodey follows. </p><p>In. Out. </p><p>Repeat. </p><p>The world comes back together, him sprawled on the floor, half on Tony as he kneels beside him. </p><p>They stay, wrapped together. The Compound is deathly silent, a tomb of memories and regrets. </p><p>&ldquo;Wanna talk about it?&rdquo; Tony&rsquo;s arm is around him, fingers tapping what Rhodey knows is the first line of JARVIS&rsquo; code. Again and again. </p><p>It&rsquo;s been years, but the ache has not dulled for either of them. </p><p>That&rsquo;s why Rhodey is here, lying in front of the War Machine armour. Because the first lesson he&rsquo;s taught Tony all those years ago, the one his Mama taught him as a black man in a whites country was that you always get back up. </p><p>He needs this, needs to get back in the armour. </p><p>Needs to protect Tony, because he hadn&rsquo;t before, he&rsquo;d failed him again and again. He wasn&rsquo;t <i>enough</i>.</p><p>And Tony has ended up in Siberia, left alone with a broken literal and figurative heart. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking too hard honey bear.&rdquo; Tony shifted, looking at him with eyes far too old and too broken. &ldquo;Spill. I thought you weren&rsquo;t gonna try this without me.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I had a nightmare.&rdquo; Rhodey said. There&rsquo;s no one here, no one except FRIDAY and Tony. No one to see how goddamn <i>weak</i> he is. &ldquo;Back at MIT.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Fun days huh?&rdquo; Tony said teasingly, but he doesn&rsquo;t smile.

It was the opposite of the traditional bucket list activities because those were the sort of acrobatic feats that Clint did on the regular: first in the circus, and second as a spy/assassin/superhero. Jumping out of a plane? He did that all the time. He bungee jumped in order to get a shot on someone who was out of range once. He&rsquo;d traveled all over the world, ate all different kinds of cuisine, and played pretty much every game known to mankind. </p><p>The only thing left then, was meeting&ndash; or sleeping with&ndash; celebrities. Tony Stark was on that list long before Clint had joined Shield, but come on, he was on everybody&rsquo;s list. He was the celebrity exception you could sleep with! And many people had. Of course then Clint met him and he was in a committed relationship, which sucked but you know, yay for him. It was fine, Clint was on a team with Tony and it turned out that he was not only gorgeous but a good person. What a jackass. Then Tony and Rumiko broke up, and Tony spent more time with the team than ever. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Tony said mildly, which was very generous considering Clint had half of his face bandaged and was drinking coffee straight out of the pot. </p><p>&ldquo;Just peachy. Did you know we have pain nerves all over our face? That seems like a design flaw.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it up with God if I ever see him again.&rdquo; </p><p>Clint nodded, taking a gulp. He was pretty sure it spilled on his shirt, but he didn&rsquo;t bother to check. At this point it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. &ldquo;You do that. It\u2019s late though. Isn&rsquo;t it late? What are you doing up at this probably late hour?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; he said with a shrug. &ldquo;Was messing around in the &lsquo;shop.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Want some company?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re up for it?&rdquo; Tony asked with a pointed look at Clint&rsquo;s bandaged face. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a precaution. I can probably take it off now.&rdquo; As soon as he said it, he set the coffee pot to the side and gingerly peeled it off. The skin under it looked tender, but ultimately healed. So long as he didn&rsquo;t rub it against anything, he&rsquo;d be fine&ndash; not even a scar to show for it. &ldquo;See? Good as new. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He chugged the rest of the coffee in the pot before they left, and all the while Tony just smiled, amused. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked when the elevator doors opened and showed something vaguely humanoid shaped. Body armor maybe? It didn&rsquo;t look enough like tech to be a new iteration of the Iron Man suit. </p><p>&ldquo;Hm? Oh, body armor,&rdquo; Tony confirmed. &ldquo;For you actually, did you want to model it? It might strike some inspiration.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve heard that line before. 'Come up and be my model&rsquo;,&rdquo; Clint said in a high pitched voice. &ldquo;'Shh no one needs to know&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p><p>Tony muffled a laugh in his hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible, never say it again.&rdquo; He tossed the half made jacket at Clint, who caught it and slid it on. </p><p>He rolled his shoulders. &ldquo;Not really made to size.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Not yet, no. It&rsquo;s a prototype. Before the prototype even; it&rsquo;s in the fetus stage of life. I need help visualizing it.&rdquo; Indeed, Tony&rsquo;s eyes looked half in their own little world, but the other half was intently focused on Clint&rsquo;s body, and that was a nice little thrill for him even if he intellectually knew that it was because of the tech and not him. He was going to enjoy it and nothing could stop him. </p><p>Now how the hell they went from bantering about the jacket and its possible future to making out on the workshop table, Clint wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure but he did have an idea. Mostly in that Tony looked more fuckable than usual with his eyes gleaming with excitement and practically bursting out of his thin and greasy tank top. And Clint had very little in the way of self control, so of course he kissed him! The unbelievable part was that Tony kissed him back. </p><p>So they were kissing&ndash; lots of tongue, Clint was a fan&ndash; and everything was going great because Tony was sitting on the workshop table and Clint was standing in front of him in the space between his legs so their bodies were pressed together. Of course that was when Steve fucking Rogers walked into the 'shop to talk to Tony about something before his morning run, and he couldn&rsquo;t just see them and leave, oh no. That was unacceptable, evidently. Instead he had to loudly say, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; </p><p>Clint and Tony&rsquo;s mouths separated with a wet sound, and Clint turned to glare at him. &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve seen people kiss before Cap. Now shoo.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How long has this been going on?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;About ten minutes,&rdquo; Tony said, leaning back lazily on one of his hands. </p><p>Steve rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Not that, I meant you two. When did you get together?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Ten minutes,&rdquo; they both said, giving Steve varying looks for how stupid they thought this was&ndash; which was little more than an extension of how annoyed they were to be interrupted. </p><p>&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure whatever it is can wait an hour or two.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Steve looked between the two of them, his 'I demand answers&rsquo; look turning into one of his trademark confused puppy looks. &ldquo;Yeah. It can wait. But only until later today,&rdquo; he added, pointing a finger at Tony. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not getting out of this entirely.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Aye aye, Captain.&rdquo; Steve left, and as soon as the door closed behind him, Tony said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what it is I&rsquo;m trying to get out of.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;That makes it all the more genius of you. Can we go back to sucking face now?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One sec,&rdquo; Tony said, putting a hand on Clint&rsquo;s chest to stop him from moving in automatically&ndash; which he&rsquo;d done because he hadn&rsquo;t expected Tony to actually say anything in response. &ldquo;We are together, right?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Yeah. Dating, committed, exclusive, whatever the fuck you want to call it that boils down to I like you but also don&rsquo;t like sharing.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an asshole,&rdquo; Tony said, but he was laughing and pulling Clint back in when he said it, so how much could he have really meant it? </p><p>*</p><p>Nat&rsquo;s eyes went between the two of them the next morning&ndash; well, afternoon, but it was when they surfaced after a little bit of sex and a little bit more of sleep. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s one off your bucket list?&rdquo; she asked Clint. </p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an asshole,&rdquo; Clint said, yawning widely. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she talking about?&rdquo; Tony asked curiously. </p><p>&ldquo;Sleeping with you was on my bucket list.&rdquo; He dumped the rest of the coffee in the pot into something that was probably a bowl given how large it was, and started a fresh pot. &ldquo;Next up is managing to keep ahold of you until I kick the bucket.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dork.&rdquo; It should have been an insult, but there was so much fondness in his voice that it didn\u2019t register as such. </p>",

It was the opposite of the traditional bucket list activities because those were the sort of acrobatic feats that Clint did on the regular: first in the circus, and second as a spy/assassin/superhero. Jumping out of a plane? He did that all the time. He bungee jumped in order to get a shot on someone who was out of range once. He\u2019d traveled all over the world, ate all different kinds of cuisine, and played pretty much every game known to mankind. </p><p>The only thing left then, was meeting\u2013 or sleeping with\u2013 celebrities. Tony Stark was on that list long before Clint had joined Shield, but come on, he was on everybody\u2019s list. He was the celebrity exception you could sleep with! And many people had. Of course then Clint met him and he was in a committed relationship, which sucked but you know, yay for him. It was fine, Clint was on a team with Tony and it turned out that he was not only gorgeous but a good person. What a jackass. Then Tony and Rumiko broke up, and Tony spent more time with the team than ever. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony said mildly, which was very generous considering Clint had half of his face bandaged and was drinking coffee straight out of the pot. </p><p>\u201cJust peachy. Did you know we have pain nerves all over our face? That seems like a design flaw.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring it up with God if I ever see him again.\u201d </p><p>Clint nodded, taking a gulp. He was pretty sure it spilled on his shirt, but he didn\u2019t bother to check. At this point it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. \u201cYou do that. It\u2019s late though. Isn\u2019t it late? What are you doing up at this probably late hour?\u201d </p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cWas messing around in the \u2018shop.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWant some company?\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re up for it?\u201d Tony asked with a pointed look at Clint\u2019s bandaged face. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a precaution. I can probably take it off now.\u201d As soon as he said it, he set the coffee pot to the side and gingerly peeled it off. The skin under it looked tender, but ultimately healed. So long as he didn\u2019t rub it against anything, he\u2019d be fine\u2013 not even a scar to show for it. \u201cSee? Good as new. Let\u2019s go.\u201d He chugged the rest of the coffee in the pot before they left, and all the while Tony just smiled, amused. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked when the elevator doors opened and showed something vaguely humanoid shaped. Body armor maybe? It didn\u2019t look enough like tech to be a new iteration of the Iron Man suit. </p><p>\u201cHm? Oh, body armor,\u201d Tony confirmed. \u201cFor you actually, did you want to model it? It might strike some inspiration.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that line before. 'Come up and be my model\u2019,\u201d Clint said in a high pitched voice. \u201c'Shh no one needs to know\u2019.\u201d </p><p>Tony muffled a laugh in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible, never say it again.\u201d He tossed the half made jacket at Clint, who caught it and slid it on. </p><p>He rolled his shoulders. \u201cNot really made to size.\u201d </p><p>\u201cNot yet, no. It\u2019s a prototype. Before the prototype even; it\u2019s in the fetus stage of life. I need help visualizing it.\u201d Indeed, Tony\u2019s eyes looked half in their own little world, but the other half was intently focused on Clint\u2019s body, and that was a nice little thrill for him even if he intellectually knew that it was because of the tech and not him. He was going to enjoy it and nothing could stop him. </p><p>Now how the hell they went from bantering about the jacket and its possible future to making out on the workshop table, Clint wasn\u2019t entirely sure but he did have an idea. Mostly in that Tony looked more fuckable than usual with his eyes gleaming with excitement and practically bursting out of his thin and greasy tank top. And Clint had very little in the way of self control, so of course he kissed him! The unbelievable part was that Tony kissed him back. </p><p>So they were kissing\u2013 lots of tongue, Clint was a fan\u2013 and everything was going great because Tony was sitting on the workshop table and Clint was standing in front of him in the space between his legs so their bodies were pressed together. Of course that was when Steve fucking Rogers walked into the 'shop to talk to Tony about something before his morning run, and he couldn\u2019t just see them and leave, oh no. That was unacceptable, evidently. Instead he had to loudly say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d </p><p>Clint and Tony\u2019s mouths separated with a wet sound, and Clint turned to glare at him. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve seen people kiss before Cap. Now shoo.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d </p><p>\u201cAbout ten minutes,\u201d Tony said, leaning back lazily on one of his hands. </p><p>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cNot that, I meant you two. When did you get together?\u201d </p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d they both said, giving Steve varying looks for how stupid they thought this was\u2013 which was little more than an extension of how annoyed they were to be interrupted. </p><p>\u201cNow go,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m sure whatever it is can wait an hour or two.\u201d </p><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Steve looked between the two of them, his 'I demand answers\u2019 look turning into one of his trademark confused puppy looks. \u201cYeah. It can wait. But only until later today,\u201d he added, pointing a finger at Tony. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting out of this entirely.\u201d </p><p>\u201cAye aye, Captain.\u201d Steve left, and as soon as the door closed behind him, Tony said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it is I\u2019m trying to get out of.\u201d </p><p>\u201cThat makes it all the more genius of you.
