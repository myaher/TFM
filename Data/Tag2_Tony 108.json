        "body": "<p>Tony peers through the curtains above the kitchen sink, smirking as Harley and Peter cannonball into the pool, laughing and splashing happily. They\u2019ve been inseparable since Peter and his aunt had moved in next door three years ago. Peter was just on the edge of 14, weeks from his birthday and upon meeting Harley had found a friend for life.</p><p>It\u2019s three weeks to Peter\u2019s 17th birthday and Tony and May have been planning his party for months. The vintage VW Bug he\u2019s purchased for Peter would be an extravagant gift if it wasn\u2019t a rusted out junker that would need a full year of work to get it operational.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"332\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba23a9f8c45d69806ef82c8c36ca893/tumblr_inline_po86eoMotc1svcrbn_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"332\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure><p>He had told May of his plans to have he and Peter work on the vehicle together so the kid would learn practical skills in mechanical engineering, a topic he knew fascinated Peter. He\u2019d assured her he\u2019d cover the cost of parts, and so long as Peter kept his grades up, he\u2019d get the keys to the vehicle the day he turned 18.</p><p>He\u2019d done the same thing for Harley and the two years of hard work had paid off\u2014the shiny cherry red 76 Camaro was parked in the driveway and had earned Harley a full ride to the local technical college and the offer of a job from a local garage. </p><p>He hopes that Peter will have as much fun working on the car with him; the kid is naturally curious and staggeringly smart, so Tony\u2019s sure he\u2019ll pick up quickly on the skills needed to repair the vehicle that\u2019s now waiting in the garage, covered by a tarp, just waiting to be revealed on his birthday. </p><p>The screeching of the screen door draws his attention to where Peter is careening around the corner, eyes going wide as his wet feet slip on the tile. He watches in slow motion as Peter falls forward, right for the sharp corner of the granite countertop. </p><p>He\u2019s moving before he realizes it, grabbing Peter\u2019s arms and hauling him up, mere breaths before he slams into the unforgiving stone. His heart beats too fast as he holds onto the kid for just a beat longer than normal, one hand plastered to the wet skin of his back. </p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathes, pulling back to run an assessing gaze over Peter, free hand tangling in those soft brown curls. \u201cYou gotta slow down kid, I don\u2019t want to have to take you to the hospital again. Your Aunt almost murdered me last time.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushes and nods, glancing away as he bites his lip, \u201cSorry Tony,\u201d he murmurs, looking up through his lashes at Tony. He worries at his lower lip with his teeth and Tony watches as it turns a rosy shade of pink at the attention, wet and shiny and something curls warm and wanting through his gut. </p><p>Clearing his throat he steps back and pats the kid\u2019s shoulder awkwardly, \u201cGreat, uh, dinner in thirty,\u201d he mutters before turning away and attempting to focus his attention on the chicken kebabs he had been working on. </p><p>He listens to Peter rustling through the fridge for a snack before he disappears back out to the pool, laughing loudly at something Harley says too softly for him to hear. Glancing out the window, he watches as Peter throws his head back, eyes shut as he laughs, stepping back and then swaying as he loses his balance on the edge of the pool and promptly falls in with a shriek. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t help the laugh that bursts out, affection warm in his chest. He continues skewering chicken and vegetables, the earlier moment with Peter pushed far from his mind. </p><p>The further from his mind, the better.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>His old friend insomnia makes a vicious return for him and he finds himself wandering the house nearly every night for two weeks, somehow managing to survive on three hours a night, exhaustion sinking deep into his bones. </p><p>He\u2019s in his study for the fourth night in a row this week working on sketches for zero emission engines he\u2019s been tinkering with lately and despite his mind numbing exhaustion he\u2019s getting further on them than he has in the past year. </p><p>Footsteps creak on the floor behind him and he turns, smiling tiredly when he sees Peter, hovering in the doorway, the long sleeves of his sweater hanging to his knuckles, looking small in the oversized fabric. He gives Tony a weak smile and waves before shuffling over and peering down at the sketch, thin fingers trailing over the paper slowly. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Tony asks, studying the young man, noting the dark circles beneath his eyes, much like his own. </p><p>Peter nods and leans on the desk, head bowed. \u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d he murmurs hoarsely, \u201cabout Uncle Ben.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach swoops at the admission; Peter and his Uncle had been out for ice cream when a mugger murdered Ben for five bucks, leaving a twelve year old Peter to watch the man bleed out on the pavement. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he offers quietly, heart plummeting when Peter shakes his head and makes a soft broken noise. When his shoulders shake Tony grabs his hand and tugs, pulling him down into his lap so he can wrap his arms firmly around Peter. </p><p>Tiny hiccuping sobs make Peter\u2019s shoulders shake and Tony feels like his chest will crack under the strain of the sorrow inside him. He holds Peter tighter and tucks his head under his chin, lips pressing to his hair as Peter cries. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay sweetheart, you\u2019re safe, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Tony croons, hand making slow circles over his back. Tony rocks him, blinking rapidly against the tears making his throat thick, nose burying in his soft locks as he inhales the warm clean scent he instantly identifies as <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>His fingers push through Peter\u2019s hair, tugging gently before coming back to slide through again, over and over, soothing and gentle. He hears Peter\u2019s breathing hitch and pulls him closer, \u201c\u2018S that feel good?\u201d he asks, hoping that he\u2019s not hurting the kid or overstepping by offering this gentle comfort. </p><p>Peter nods and squirms in his lap and Tony tugs on his hair, \u201cJust relax kid, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he murmurs, running his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair, thumb making small circles behind his ear. Peter shudders and makes a soft noise that sounds like a moan and it occurs to him suddenly, that this is inappropriate. </p><p>When he stops caressing Peter the boy makes a low, displeased sound and arches into his hand, \u201cFeels good,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cplease?\u201d</p><p>And who is Tony to deny him? </p><p>He nods unsteadily and resumes, heat building under his skin when Peter sighs and rolls his hips, another sound coming from the boy that\u2019s positively filthy. He can hear Peter\u2019s breathing growing uneven, hot on his skin where his face is pressed to Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>His nails drag through Peter\u2019s hair, some dark, hungry part of him wanting to hear those sounds again, and he\u2019s rewarded with a whimper from Peter, hand curling and digging into Tony\u2019s shoulder as his hips stutter upward. A quick glance down shows him the kid is hard; swallowing hard, he closes his eyes and tells himself he\u2019s just being comforting. </p><p>It\u2019s a lie, but it\u2019s one he needs to tell. </p><p>\u201cS-sorry,\u201d Peter whispers breathily, still clutching desperately to Tony\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor what kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M not a kid,\u201d is the petulant reply, followed by a soft whine when Tony tugs on his hair experimentally. Peter goes still on his lap, breathing too fast and uneven to be anything but arousal. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony asks, fingers resuming their trail through his hair and against his skin. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u2019s just&hellip;my hair,\u201d Peter gasps, whimpering again when Tony tugs lightly. </p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, voice low and hot and Christ, he\u2019s going to hell for how it makes his cock twitch to hear Peter\u2019s breath hitch, hot and wet against his throat. </p><p>\u201cMmmhmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels good?\u201d</p><p>Peter gasps when Tony\u2019s nails scratch at his scalp, hips jolting, \u201cY-Yes, yes, <i>please</i>,\u201d he whines and <i>fuck</i>, Tony\u2019s a goner. </p><p>His free hand slides under Peter\u2019s sweater so he can drag his nails down his back, biting back a groan when the kid shudders and moans, arching into him, soft pleas whispered in his ear. \u201cPlease\u2026.Mr. Stark, please,\u201d he begs, voice cracking and shit, he should stop, this isn&rsquo;t right and he knows that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry kid,\u201d he grinds out, \u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d he whispers, but his hands remain on Peter and neither of them move as Peter whines and shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His hand tightens in Peter\u2019s hair, the one at his back pressing hard in counterpoint and Peter gasps, face pressing into his neck with wet, hot breathy moans. </p><p>\u201cPlease Tony, please.\u201d</p><p>Cursing himself, he presses his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, \u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetheart, shhh, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re so good Peter, c\u2019mon sweetheart, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he rambles, feeling it when Peter shudders and moans, hips rolling up into nothing. He pets and rubs Peter, heat in his cheeks and burning low in his gut and to his shame, he realizes he too is hard. </p><p>It\u2019s just biology he tells himself, a reaction to having a pretty, aroused boy in his lap, begging to cum. It\u2019s not Peter&hellip;it can\u2019t be, because then he\u2019d be a goddamn monster. </p><p>He tugs too hard on Peter\u2019s hair and feels it a moment later when the kid cries out, the sound muffled against his throat as he sobs, hips hitching, and cums. Cursing, Tony grits his teeth as Peter\u2019s hips push down against his erection, stars blooming behind his lids at the near painful pleasure he gets from his jeans rubbing into his cock.</p><p>Peter pants against his neck and Tony can feel the tears the boy has shed, apparently overcome with pleasure. A sick wave of pride swells within him that he\u2019s made Peter feel so good he\u2019s left in tears, and that same thing makes him wonder what it would be like to do it again, except this time, with Peter spread out beneath him so he can watch him plead and cry. </p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s breathing evens out and Tony can feel him go lax in his arms, sleepy little noises making him smile. He adjusts his grip and stands, holding Peter as he ascends the stairs slowly, steps steady and quiet. He pauses for a moment, considering what the most responsible option is here, and after a moment of hesitation, heads to the end of the hallway to his bedroom. </p><p>When he tries to put Peter down and pull away, the young man makes a sleepy noise of protest and wraps his hand in Tony\u2019s T-shirt, holding onto him tightly. \u201cStay,\u201d he slurs, eyes opening in a soft flutter, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Tony wavers for a minute and then nods, \u201cOkay kid, lemme just get you under the covers,\u201d he murmurs, gently guiding Peter\u2019s lax limbs beneath his sheets. Peter curls up and smiles sleepily at him and the sight leaves Tony momentarily breathless. </p><p>He stares at him, motionless for a moment before shaking his head and stripping quickly. He tosses his T-shirt aside and pulls on soft cotton pants, stilling when he glances up and finds Peter watching him through hooded eyes. He\u2019s seen that look on the faces of other pretty young things before he takes them to bed, but to see it now on the face of someone he considers family, whose never looked at him like that before, it makes his gut twist. </p><p>He debates not getting into bed, thinks that he should take the safer route(<b><i>hah</i></b>\u2014<i>nothing</i> is safe anymore now that he knows what Peter sounds like when he cums) and go back down to his office but Peter pouts at him and holds out a hand and he\u2019s weak, so, so <i>weak</i>, so he slides beneath the covers and moments later Peter is snuggling into him with a soft contented sound.</p><p>Pressing his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, he rubs a hand over his spine slowly, \u201cSleep sweetheart,\u201d he encourages, eyes falling shut as Peter wriggles and then sighs, tucking his face into Tony\u2019s throat. </p><p>\u201cNight Tony,\u201d he whispers, breath warm on his skin. </p><p>Tony shivers, hands tightening on him, \u201cNight kid.\u201d</p><hr><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It turns into a routine; Peter stays the night, can\u2019t sleep, and winds up in his bed before the night is through. There\u2019s no repeat of that first time in his office\u2014he\u2019s painfully careful when touching Peter now, but he sees it in his eyes, a yearning for more, and he can\u2019t deny that despite his best efforts, the memory is now at the forefront of his thoughts when he jacks off. </p><p>He knows it isn\u2019t normal, isn\u2019t safe, but he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop. He can\u2019t resist when Peter comes to him with pleading eyes and dark circles beneath his eyes. </p><p>Eventually though it\u2019s not just about insomnia, because Peter comes to his room after Harley falls asleep and slides into his bed, and if he\u2019s honest with himself it\u2019s the best sleep he\u2019s gotten in years. He shouldn\u2019t let it continue, he knows that, and yet he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop it. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Predictably, Peter is ecstatic upon receiving his car, launching himself into Tony\u2019s arms with a grin of delight, babbling thanks as Tony laughs and hugs him back, fingers curling in soft curls to hold him closer, tighter. May\u2019s eyes sparkle and Harley grins, and it all feels&hellip;right. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He\u2019s in the middle of explaining something, head under the hood of the car while he waits for Peter to find the wrench he needs, when suddenly there\u2019s a warm presence at his back. He realizes with a stutter that Peter\u2019s pressed against him, peering over his shoulder at the engine, one hand bracing in between his shoulders as the other sets down the wrench on the engine block. </p><p>Thing is, Peter doesn\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the issue?\u201d Peter asks in his ear and he realizes he\u2019s stopped talking, heat crawling up his face when Peter leans over further, hips pressing into Tony\u2019s as his fingers dig into his back. He represses a shudder at the touch and nods, goes back to explaining what they\u2019re fixing and why. </p><p>Tries to put it out of his mind. </p><p>Except, it happens again.</p><p>The next time they\u2019re working on the car it seems like Peter brushes into or against him any chance he can, hands lingering unnecessarily while he gazes at Tony through hooded eyes. </p><p>He ignores it, or does his best to anyway, but it\u2019s hard to ignore when the kid is in his bed every night he stays over. He\u2019d say something to May about changing her shifts, but he knows they pay more for third shift, and there\u2019s a very large part of him that doesn\u2019t want it to stop because then he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep so he says nothing. </p><p>It\u2019s just Peter he tries to reason, the kid he\u2019s known since his voice was cracking, the kid who is, essentially, family. It\u2019s just an infatuation, he assures himself, nothing to worry about. </p><p>Except he can\u2019t get it out of his head, the sounds he made, the way he gasped Tony\u2019s name, the shudder he\u2019d felt beneath his palms as he came. </p><p>It\u2019s a goddamn nightmare is what it is. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Everything comes to a head one evening while he and Peter work on the Bug\u2014May at work and Harley on a date. Tony has worked hard to avoid being alone like this with Peter\u2014but still hasn\u2019t managed to keep him from his bed. </p><p>He offhandedly orders Peter to stop fucking around with the box cutter, head beneath the hood of the car while he twists at the bolt he\u2019s been trying to loosen for five minutes when he hears Peter curse. When he comes up, he finds Peter shirtless, fabric wrapped around his palm where he\u2019s apparently cut himself. </p><p>Panic sluices through Tony and he slams the hood of the car shut, grabs Peter and makes him sit, ignoring his protests of <i>I\u2019m fine Tony, honestly</i>, in favor of grabbing his first aid kit and stool. Tossing the kit on the hood, he slides his glasses up his nose and unwraps the shirt, grimacing in sympathy. </p><p>It\u2019s a deep cut, but not too long, half an inch and easily taken care of. He cleans it, eyes shooting up to Peter\u2019s face when he hisses, shaking his head when he looks back down at the wound. </p><p>\u201cI told you to be careful,\u201d he mutters. </p><p>\u201cI was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm, that\u2019s why I\u2019m bandaging up your hand, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly, doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine,\u201d Tony replies through clenched teeth, his carefully held control wavering at the sight of Peter\u2019s blood on his hands. \u201cI tell you to do something while we\u2019re working, you do it. There are dangerous tools in here and if I tell you to stop touching something, you need to <i>listen</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea well, you\u2019re not my dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands still, anger and disbelief surging up within him as he lifts his gaze to find Peter staring down at him defiantly. He\u2019s almost proud of the kid, for showing that kind of defiance to a person he\u2019s normally so deferential with, but it\u2019s not enough to override the annoyance. </p><p>\u201cGood thing you\u2019re not my kid then, or I\u2019d bend you over the hood of this car and turn your ass red.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushes pink, swallowing hard as a broken noise hitches out of his throat. Tony\u2019s gaze is hungry on his lips, bitten red and wet from where he\u2019s licked them, parted around breathless little pants. His pupils eat up the warm brown of his irises, eyes glazed with lust and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe you <i>want</i> me to punish you,\u201d Tony muses, gaze flickering over the lithe muscular planes of Peter\u2019s chest, skin creamy under the pale lights in the garage, nipples blush pink and hard. \u201cHmm, is that what you want kid? You need a spanking?\u201d</p><p>At this Peter whines and the blush on his cheeks extends down to his chest and it\u2019s such a pretty sight it makes Tony\u2019s gut twist with the urge to dirty him up. Surging forward, he grabs the back of Peter\u2019s neck and hauls him to his feet, spinning him around so his chest is pressed to the cold metal, grinning when he gasps and arches away from the sensation.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is pressed to the side and when Tony\u2019s hand slips under him to tug at his belt, Peter whispers, \u201cYea daddy, ruin me,\u201d and <i>fuck</i>, Tony loses it. Growling, he bends down and bites the back of Peter\u2019s neck, hand shoving into his jeans and briefs to close around the kids cock, a low groan rumbling out of his chest at the feel of his hot, wet skin. </p><p>Peter whines and arches his hips, <i>daddy</i> falling from his wet, shiny lips. Tony leaves another mark on his shoulder as he starts stroking him, heat surging in his veins as Peter writhes and moans, ass pressing back into Tony\u2019s groin. </p><p>He wants to see Peter\u2019s face, needs it, so he pulls back and turns the kid, shoving him back so his shoulders hit the metal with a dull clang, surging down to kiss him before he\u2019s fully able to protest the loss of Tony\u2019s hand on his cock. Peter mewls into the kiss, desperate and loud as Tony licks into his mouth, just as desperate as the kid.</p><p>His hands fumble with Peter\u2019s belt and jeans for a moment before he\u2019s got them pulled down his thighs, freeing his cock so he finally gets a look at it. Groaning, he wraps his hand around it and strokes slowly as he pulls on Peter\u2019s hair, tugging his head back so he can mark up his throat too. </p><p>\u201cLook at you sweetheart, all wet and moaning for daddy,\u201d he pants, \u201cyou daddy\u2019s desperate little slut?\u201d he demands, grinning against Peter\u2019s throat when he moans and nods, hips rolling up so his cock slides through Tony\u2019s hand. </p><p>He digs in with avaricious pleasure, mouth sliding down to leave deep red marks on the creamy skin of Peter\u2019s chest. \u201cGonna mark you up baby, let everyone know who you belong to,\u201d he rasps, heat curling through his belly when Peter nods and arches, pleading in soft breathy gasps. </p><p>Stroking Peter\u2019s cock a little faster, he focuses his attention on those pretty little nipples, sucking and biting until they\u2019re red, swollen and so sensitive that Peter sobs at the slightest touch. He pulls back a moment just to admire the sight beneath him; hair in disarray, lips bitten and wet, marks all over his skin, cock leaking hard in his grasp\u2026</p><p>\u201cChrist kid, I aughta take a picture, you\u2019re a goddamn work of art,\u201d he groans, brows rising when Peter nods and moans, hips arching into his hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease? Please,\u201d Peter begs brokenly and Tony\u2019s mouth goes dry; hand fumbling into his back pocket he pulls out his phone and opens the camera, snaps a few pictures and then pauses, switches it to the video function with a low burning of guilt and shame in the back of his throat.</p><p>Holding the phone in one hand and Peter\u2019s cock in the other, he strokes him, wrist twisting and thumb digging into the red, throbbing head hard enough to have Peter arching up off the rusted metal beneath him, more cum pulsing out as his thighs quiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna&hellip;please!\u201d</p><p>Tony groans softly and nods, jerking him faster, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, come for daddy, let me hear you,\u201d he demands throatily, his own cock hard behind his zipper. He focuses his attention on the head of Peter\u2019s cock and is rewarded when the boy cries out, high and sharp before breaking into breathless gasps as he comes, thighs shaking and head thrown back in ecstasy. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, look at you, you\u2019re so goddamn pretty,\u201d Tony whispered, stroking Peter till he was shaking and whimpering, looking up through tear stained eyes and begging for him to stop. His hand is coated in cum as he hurriedly undoes his jeans and pulls out his cock, stepping closer so he\u2019s between Peter\u2019s spread thighs as he strokes his own cock. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a mess baby,\u201d Tony whispers hoarsely, hips jolting as he strokes his cock faster. Peter watches him through hooded eyes, sweat and cum on his chest, a hungry look in his eyes as he follows the motion of Tony\u2019s hand over his cock. </p><p>\u201cYou like that? Seeing what you do to daddy?\u201d </p><p>Peter nods and leans up a little, \u201cYea daddy, I like it.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, wrist twisting as heat builds in his gut\u2014he\u2019s so close. \u201cCan I\u2014shit&hellip;can I come on you baby?\u201d he asks, needing desperately to see his pretty boy all covered in his cum. </p><p>Peter nods and leans back on his elbows, grinning when Tony moans and steps even closer. The wet sound of his hand on his cock is loud in the small confines of the garage and he thinks distantly that it\u2019s a good thing the neighbors aren\u2019t too close or they\u2019d be getting an earful. </p><p>\u201cCome on daddy, cum on me,\u201d Peter whispers, staring up at him with big wide eyes and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it takes for Tony to start coming. Ropes of cum land on Peter\u2019s chest before the kid sits up suddenly and opens his mouth, the sight so dirty and depraved it rips a groan from Tony\u2019s chest. </p><p>He jerks himself harder, cursing as his cum splashes into Peter\u2019s mouth, down over his petal pink lips and over his chin. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, oh god, oh you look so good,\u201d he groans, head falling back as Peter suddenly surges forward to close his lips around the head of Tony\u2019s cock. Slim fingers join his in stroking his cock and the wet heat of his mouth has him coming undone again, loud groans echoing off the cinder block walls. </p><p>When he\u2019s shuddering from sensitivity he gently pushes Peter away, smiling down at him as he swipes his thumb under his lip and pushes it into his mouth so Peter can suck his cum off it. Peter hums and looks up at him, doe eyed and fucked out and he shivers, knowing that this is a mistake he can\u2019t take back, and one he\u2019s already thinking of repeating.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good Tony,\u201d the boy whispers, leaning back on his elbows as Tony ends the video recording and slides his phone and then cock away. </p><p>The sound of an engine rumbling drags his attention away from Peter and out the garage window to where Harley is parking his car in the driveway. Pure panic sluices thorough him\u2014\u201cHarley\u2019s back, we gotta clean you up,\u201d he tells Peter frantically. </p><p>They stumble and knock into each other as Tony grabs a greasy rag and wipes it over Peter\u2019s chest, shoving his bloody shirt at him, \u201cPut it on!\u201d he hisses, panic rising when the engine outside shuts off. They have mere moments before Harley walks in and they\u2019re not going to make it, and oh god, what\u2019s he done? </p><p>He glances at Peter who still looks fucked out despite the grease and blood on his shirt, and shit, he shouldn\u2019t enjoy it as much as he does, but he guesses that now he knows\u2014he\u2019s deeply fucked up.</p><p>The door crashes open just as he and Peter bend back over the engine of the car, talking too fast, but it doesn\u2019t matter because then Harley is plopping on the stool and regailing them with the story of his date. It takes a few minute before he realizes Peter\u2019s shirt is stained with blood and then they\u2019re going into the house for a change of clothes and he\u2019s alone, suddenly, and the reality of the last hour crashes down on him. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He manages to avoid being alone with Peter for three days before they wind up in the kitchen together at 2am. Peter is sitting on the island, fingers wrapped around a mug of cocoa when he walks in, pausing for a moment before shuffling over to make himself a drink. </p><p>\u201cDoes it help?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, frowning, \u201cDoes what help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alcohol. Does it help you forget what we did?\u201d</p><p>Tony stills, heart clenching painfully in his chest. He drops his head and exhales slowly before putting aside the whiskey and reaching for a mug\u2014cocoa is sounding better by the minute. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to forget,\u201d he murmurs, popping the k-cup into the Keurig and setting it to run before he turns around. Peter is eyeing him skeptically, the hurt in the back of his gaze making Tony\u2019s brow furrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I hurt you,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019ve just been\u2026\u201d he trails off and runs a hand through his hair, \u201cthinking. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a noncommittal sound and sips his cocoa, \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asks softly, hopefully. </p><p>\u201cChrist, Pete, yea I enjoyed it,\u201d he says with a disbelieving laugh, \u201cthat\u2019s part of the issue. You\u2019re seventeen, a kid, and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld? Too mature? Not good enough?\u201d Peter supplies dryly, \u201cdo I get an opinion at all about this?\u201d he asks sharply and the words cut into Tony like little barbs. \u201cOr are you going to decide what\u2019s best for me just because you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Tony shakes his head and sighs, \u201cShit I\u2019m too tired for this,\u201d he mutters and then drops his hand, smiles tiredly at Peter and waves a hand, \u201cGo on. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him for moment and then shrugs a shoulder, \u201cI liked what happened, a lot. I\u2019ve wanted it to happen for a while, but I knew you didn\u2019t see me like that. I understand if you think I\u2019m not ready for sex or a relationship, but, well, I\u2019ve waited this long, I can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach plummets at that because shit, that\u2019s exactly what he doesn\u2019t want. He doesn\u2019t want to string Peter along for years while he gets comfortable with the idea of fucking a teenager, but he doesn\u2019t want to let him go either. He loves the kid, more than is appropriate, and he just has to figure out what the hell he\u2019s supposed to do now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to wait for me Peter, that\u2019s not fair to you,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing a hand over his face again. </p><p>\u201cWhat if&hellip;we took it slow?\u201d Peter offers and he glances up to find the kid watching him with a wary, hopeful expression. </p><p>Tony contemplates that while he sips his cocoa; in a year Peter would be headed off to MIT and be 18, finally on his own and ready to experience the wild world of college life. Can they make that, plus a long distance relationship work? </p><p>He scoffs at himself, because really, he already knows he\u2019s going to try, because it\u2019s <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>Setting aside his mug he stands up from where he\u2019s been leaning on the counter and crosses the short distance between them, hands landing gently on Peter\u2019s knees. He watches as the boy goes wide eyed and then slowly pushes his knees apart, hands sliding up his thighs to his hips.</p><p>Peter gasps softly, lips pink and inviting, and Tony leans up till his lips are very neatly pressed against them. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you want baby,\u201d Tony murmurs, watching as Peter shudders, eyes drooping with lust. Lithe arms wind around his shoulders and his hands at Peter\u2019s waist drag him closer\u2014hip to hip so he can feel the erection the kid is already sporting. </p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Tony nods and kisses him softly, \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>Peter melts into his kiss, sighing happily as Tony presses against him, hands demanding and firm on his body. They abandon cocoa for Tony\u2019s bed, and despite the urge for more, Tony takes his time in kissing Peter, running his hands over his body till he\u2019s as familiar with it as he is his own. </p><p>Peter falls asleep after Tony wrings his body dry with his hands and mouth, body lax in that way that can only come from hard physical labor or extremely satisfying orgasms. Tony watches him sleep, fingers running through his hair slowly, a faint smile on his lips. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a mistake, maybe it\u2019ll end badly, or maybe\u2026</p><p>Maybe it\u2019ll be the best thing he\u2019s ever done.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>ayyyyyeeeee, it\u2019s daddy tony!!

He continues skewering chicken and vegetables, the earlier moment with Peter pushed far from his mind. </p><p>The further from his mind, the better.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>His old friend insomnia makes a vicious return for him and he finds himself wandering the house nearly every night for two weeks, somehow managing to survive on three hours a night, exhaustion sinking deep into his bones. </p><p>He\u2019s in his study for the fourth night in a row this week working on sketches for zero emission engines he\u2019s been tinkering with lately and despite his mind numbing exhaustion he\u2019s getting further on them than he has in the past year. </p><p>Footsteps creak on the floor behind him and he turns, smiling tiredly when he sees Peter, hovering in the doorway, the long sleeves of his sweater hanging to his knuckles, looking small in the oversized fabric. He gives Tony a weak smile and waves before shuffling over and peering down at the sketch, thin fingers trailing over the paper slowly. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Tony asks, studying the young man, noting the dark circles beneath his eyes, much like his own. </p><p>Peter nods and leans on the desk, head bowed. \u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d he murmurs hoarsely, \u201cabout Uncle Ben.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach swoops at the admission; Peter and his Uncle had been out for ice cream when a mugger murdered Ben for five bucks, leaving a twelve year old Peter to watch the man bleed out on the pavement. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he offers quietly, heart plummeting when Peter shakes his head and makes a soft broken noise. When his shoulders shake Tony grabs his hand and tugs, pulling him down into his lap so he can wrap his arms firmly around Peter. </p><p>Tiny hiccuping sobs make Peter\u2019s shoulders shake and Tony feels like his chest will crack under the strain of the sorrow inside him. He holds Peter tighter and tucks his head under his chin, lips pressing to his hair as Peter cries. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay sweetheart, you\u2019re safe, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Tony croons, hand making slow circles over his back. Tony rocks him, blinking rapidly against the tears making his throat thick, nose burying in his soft locks as he inhales the warm clean scent he instantly identifies as <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>His fingers push through Peter\u2019s hair, tugging gently before coming back to slide through again, over and over, soothing and gentle. He hears Peter\u2019s breathing hitch and pulls him closer, \u201c\u2018S that feel good?\u201d he asks, hoping that he\u2019s not hurting the kid or overstepping by offering this gentle comfort. </p><p>Peter nods and squirms in his lap and Tony tugs on his hair, \u201cJust relax kid, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he murmurs, running his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair, thumb making small circles behind his ear. Peter shudders and makes a soft noise that sounds like a moan and it occurs to him suddenly, that this is inappropriate. </p><p>When he stops caressing Peter the boy makes a low, displeased sound and arches into his hand, \u201cFeels good,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cplease?\u201d</p><p>And who is Tony to deny him? </p><p>He nods unsteadily and resumes, heat building under his skin when Peter sighs and rolls his hips, another sound coming from the boy that\u2019s positively filthy. He can hear Peter\u2019s breathing growing uneven, hot on his skin where his face is pressed to Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>His nails drag through Peter\u2019s hair, some dark, hungry part of him wanting to hear those sounds again, and he\u2019s rewarded with a whimper from Peter, hand curling and digging into Tony\u2019s shoulder as his hips stutter upward. A quick glance down shows him the kid is hard; swallowing hard, he closes his eyes and tells himself he\u2019s just being comforting. </p><p>It\u2019s a lie, but it\u2019s one he needs to tell. </p><p>\u201cS-sorry,\u201d Peter whispers breathily, still clutching desperately to Tony\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor what kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M not a kid,\u201d is the petulant reply, followed by a soft whine when Tony tugs on his hair experimentally. Peter goes still on his lap, breathing too fast and uneven to be anything but arousal. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony asks, fingers resuming their trail through his hair and against his skin. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u2019s just\u2026my hair,\u201d Peter gasps, whimpering again when Tony tugs lightly. </p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, voice low and hot and Christ, he\u2019s going to hell for how it makes his cock twitch to hear Peter\u2019s breath hitch, hot and wet against his throat. </p><p>\u201cMmmhmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels good?\u201d</p><p>Peter gasps when Tony\u2019s nails scratch at his scalp, hips jolting, \u201cY-Yes, yes, <i>please</i>,\u201d he whines and <i>fuck</i>, Tony\u2019s a goner. </p><p>His free hand slides under Peter\u2019s sweater so he can drag his nails down his back, biting back a groan when the kid shudders and moans, arching into him, soft pleas whispered in his ear. \u201cPlease\u2026.Mr. Stark, please,\u201d he begs, voice cracking and shit, he should stop, this isn\u2019t right and he knows that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry kid,\u201d he grinds out, \u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d he whispers, but his hands remain on Peter and neither of them move as Peter whines and shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His hand tightens in Peter\u2019s hair, the one at his back pressing hard in counterpoint and Peter gasps, face pressing into his neck with wet, hot breathy moans. </p><p>\u201cPlease Tony, please.\u201d</p><p>Cursing himself, he presses his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, \u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetheart, shhh, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re so good Peter, c\u2019mon sweetheart, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he rambles, feeling it when Peter shudders and moans, hips rolling up into nothing. He pets and rubs Peter, heat in his cheeks and burning low in his gut and to his shame, he realizes he too is hard. </p><p>It\u2019s just biology he tells himself, a reaction to having a pretty, aroused boy in his lap, begging to cum. It\u2019s not Peter\u2026it can\u2019t be, because then he\u2019d be a goddamn monster. </p><p>He tugs too hard on Peter\u2019s hair and feels it a moment later when the kid cries out, the sound muffled against his throat as he sobs, hips hitching, and cums. Cursing, Tony grits his teeth as Peter\u2019s hips push down against his erection, stars blooming behind his lids at the near painful pleasure he gets from his jeans rubbing into his cock.</p><p>Peter pants against his neck and Tony can feel the tears the boy has shed, apparently overcome with pleasure. A sick wave of pride swells within him that he\u2019s made Peter feel so good he\u2019s left in tears, and that same thing makes him wonder what it would be like to do it again, except this time, with Peter spread out beneath him so he can watch him plead and cry. </p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s breathing evens out and Tony can feel him go lax in his arms, sleepy little noises making him smile. He adjusts his grip and stands, holding Peter as he ascends the stairs slowly, steps steady and quiet. He pauses for a moment, considering what the most responsible option is here, and after a moment of hesitation, heads to the end of the hallway to his bedroom. </p><p>When he tries to put Peter down and pull away, the young man makes a sleepy noise of protest and wraps his hand in Tony\u2019s T-shirt, holding onto him tightly. \u201cStay,\u201d he slurs, eyes opening in a soft flutter, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Tony wavers for a minute and then nods, \u201cOkay kid, lemme just get you under the covers,\u201d he murmurs, gently guiding Peter\u2019s lax limbs beneath his sheets. Peter curls up and smiles sleepily at him and the sight leaves Tony momentarily breathless. </p><p>He stares at him, motionless for a moment before shaking his head and stripping quickly. He tosses his T-shirt aside and pulls on soft cotton pants, stilling when he glances up and finds Peter watching him through hooded eyes. He\u2019s seen that look on the faces of other pretty young things before he takes them to bed, but to see it now on the face of someone he considers family, whose never looked at him like that before, it makes his gut twist. </p><p>He debates not getting into bed, thinks that he should take the safer route(<b><i>hah</i></b>\u2014<i>nothing</i> is safe anymore now that he knows what Peter sounds like when he cums) and go back down to his office but Peter pouts at him and holds out a hand and he\u2019s weak, so, so <i>weak</i>, so he slides beneath the covers and moments later Peter is snuggling into him with a soft contented sound.</p><p>Pressing his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, he rubs a hand over his spine slowly, \u201cSleep sweetheart,\u201d he encourages, eyes falling shut as Peter wriggles and then sighs, tucking his face into Tony\u2019s throat. </p><p>\u201cNight Tony,\u201d he whispers, breath warm on his skin. </p><p>Tony shivers, hands tightening on him, \u201cNight kid.\u201d</p><hr><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It turns into a routine; Peter stays the night, can\u2019t sleep, and winds up in his bed before the night is through. There\u2019s no repeat of that first time in his office\u2014he\u2019s painfully careful when touching Peter now, but he sees it in his eyes, a yearning for more, and he can\u2019t deny that despite his best efforts, the memory is now at the forefront of his thoughts when he jacks off. </p><p>He knows it isn\u2019t normal, isn\u2019t safe, but he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop. He can\u2019t resist when Peter comes to him with pleading eyes and dark circles beneath his eyes. </p><p>Eventually though it\u2019s not just about insomnia, because Peter comes to his room after Harley falls asleep and slides into his bed, and if he\u2019s honest with himself it\u2019s the best sleep he\u2019s gotten in years. He shouldn\u2019t let it continue, he knows that, and yet he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop it. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Predictably, Peter is ecstatic upon receiving his car, launching himself into Tony\u2019s arms with a grin of delight, babbling thanks as Tony laughs and hugs him back, fingers curling in soft curls to hold him closer, tighter. May\u2019s eyes sparkle and Harley grins, and it all feels\u2026right. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He\u2019s in the middle of explaining something, head under the hood of the car while he waits for Peter to find the wrench he needs, when suddenly there\u2019s a warm presence at his back. He realizes with a stutter that Peter\u2019s pressed against him, peering over his shoulder at the engine, one hand bracing in between his shoulders as the other sets down the wrench on the engine block. </p><p>Thing is, Peter doesn\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the issue?\u201d Peter asks in his ear and he realizes he\u2019s stopped talking, heat crawling up his face when Peter leans over further, hips pressing into Tony\u2019s as his fingers dig into his back. He represses a shudder at the touch and nods, goes back to explaining what they\u2019re fixing and why. </p><p>Tries to put it out of his mind. </p><p>Except, it happens again.</p><p>The next time they\u2019re working on the car it seems like Peter brushes into or against him any chance he can, hands lingering unnecessarily while he gazes at Tony through hooded eyes. </p><p>He ignores it, or does his best to anyway, but it\u2019s hard to ignore when the kid is in his bed every night he stays over. He\u2019d say something to May about changing her shifts, but he knows they pay more for third shift, and there\u2019s a very large part of him that doesn\u2019t want it to stop because then he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep so he says nothing. </p><p>It\u2019s just Peter he tries to reason, the kid he\u2019s known since his voice was cracking, the kid who is, essentially, family. It\u2019s just an infatuation, he assures himself, nothing to worry about. </p><p>Except he can\u2019t get it out of his head, the sounds he made, the way he gasped Tony\u2019s name, the shudder he\u2019d felt beneath his palms as he came. </p><p>It\u2019s a goddamn nightmare is what it is. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Everything comes to a head one evening while he and Peter work on the Bug\u2014May at work and Harley on a date. Tony has worked hard to avoid being alone like this with Peter\u2014but still hasn\u2019t managed to keep him from his bed. </p><p>He offhandedly orders Peter to stop fucking around with the box cutter, head beneath the hood of the car while he twists at the bolt he\u2019s been trying to loosen for five minutes when he hears Peter curse. When he comes up, he finds Peter shirtless, fabric wrapped around his palm where he\u2019s apparently cut himself. </p><p>Panic sluices through Tony and he slams the hood of the car shut, grabs Peter and makes him sit, ignoring his protests of <i>I\u2019m fine Tony, honestly</i>, in favor of grabbing his first aid kit and stool. Tossing the kit on the hood, he slides his glasses up his nose and unwraps the shirt, grimacing in sympathy. </p><p>It\u2019s a deep cut, but not too long, half an inch and easily taken care of. He cleans it, eyes shooting up to Peter\u2019s face when he hisses, shaking his head when he looks back down at the wound. </p><p>\u201cI told you to be careful,\u201d he mutters. </p><p>\u201cI was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm, that\u2019s why I\u2019m bandaging up your hand, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly, doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine,\u201d Tony replies through clenched teeth, his carefully held control wavering at the sight of Peter\u2019s blood on his hands. \u201cI tell you to do something while we\u2019re working, you do it. There are dangerous tools in here and if I tell you to stop touching something, you need to <i>listen</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea well, you\u2019re not my dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands still, anger and disbelief surging up within him as he lifts his gaze to find Peter staring down at him defiantly. He\u2019s almost proud of the kid, for showing that kind of defiance to a person he\u2019s normally so deferential with, but it\u2019s not enough to override the annoyance. </p><p>\u201cGood thing you\u2019re not my kid then, or I\u2019d bend you over the hood of this car and turn your ass red.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushes pink, swallowing hard as a broken noise hitches out of his throat. Tony\u2019s gaze is hungry on his lips, bitten red and wet from where he\u2019s licked them, parted around breathless little pants. His pupils eat up the warm brown of his irises, eyes glazed with lust and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe you <i>want</i> me to punish you,\u201d Tony muses, gaze flickering over the lithe muscular planes of Peter\u2019s chest, skin creamy under the pale lights in the garage, nipples blush pink and hard. \u201cHmm, is that what you want kid? You need a spanking?\u201d</p><p>At this Peter whines and the blush on his cheeks extends down to his chest and it\u2019s such a pretty sight it makes Tony\u2019s gut twist with the urge to dirty him up. Surging forward, he grabs the back of Peter\u2019s neck and hauls him to his feet, spinning him around so his chest is pressed to the cold metal, grinning when he gasps and arches away from the sensation.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is pressed to the side and when Tony\u2019s hand slips under him to tug at his belt, Peter whispers, \u201cYea daddy, ruin me,\u201d and <i>fuck</i>, Tony loses it. Growling, he bends down and bites the back of Peter\u2019s neck, hand shoving into his jeans and briefs to close around the kids cock, a low groan rumbling out of his chest at the feel of his hot, wet skin. </p><p>Peter whines and arches his hips, <i>daddy</i> falling from his wet, shiny lips. Tony leaves another mark on his shoulder as he starts stroking him, heat surging in his veins as Peter writhes and moans, ass pressing back into Tony\u2019s groin. </p><p>He wants to see Peter\u2019s face, needs it, so he pulls back and turns the kid, shoving him back so his shoulders hit the metal with a dull clang, surging down to kiss him before he\u2019s fully able to protest the loss of Tony\u2019s hand on his cock. Peter mewls into the kiss, desperate and loud as Tony licks into his mouth, just as desperate as the kid.</p><p>His hands fumble with Peter\u2019s belt and jeans for a moment before he\u2019s got them pulled down his thighs, freeing his cock so he finally gets a look at it. Groaning, he wraps his hand around it and strokes slowly as he pulls on Peter\u2019s hair, tugging his head back so he can mark up his throat too. </p><p>\u201cLook at you sweetheart, all wet and moaning for daddy,\u201d he pants, \u201cyou daddy\u2019s desperate little slut?\u201d he demands, grinning against Peter\u2019s throat when he moans and nods, hips rolling up so his cock slides through Tony\u2019s hand. </p><p>He digs in with avaricious pleasure, mouth sliding down to leave deep red marks on the creamy skin of Peter\u2019s chest. \u201cGonna mark you up baby, let everyone know who you belong to,\u201d he rasps, heat curling through his belly when Peter nods and arches, pleading in soft breathy gasps. </p><p>Stroking Peter\u2019s cock a little faster, he focuses his attention on those pretty little nipples, sucking and biting until they\u2019re red, swollen and so sensitive that Peter sobs at the slightest touch. He pulls back a moment just to admire the sight beneath him; hair in disarray, lips bitten and wet, marks all over his skin, cock leaking hard in his grasp\u2026</p><p>\u201cChrist kid, I aughta take a picture, you\u2019re a goddamn work of art,\u201d he groans, brows rising when Peter nods and moans, hips arching into his hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease? Please,\u201d Peter begs brokenly and Tony\u2019s mouth goes dry; hand fumbling into his back pocket he pulls out his phone and opens the camera, snaps a few pictures and then pauses, switches it to the video function with a low burning of guilt and shame in the back of his throat.</p><p>Holding the phone in one hand and Peter\u2019s cock in the other, he strokes him, wrist twisting and thumb digging into the red, throbbing head hard enough to have Peter arching up off the rusted metal beneath him, more cum pulsing out as his thighs quiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026please!\u201d</p><p>Tony groans softly and nods, jerking him faster, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, come for daddy, let me hear you,\u201d he demands throatily, his own cock hard behind his zipper. He focuses his attention on the head of Peter\u2019s cock and is rewarded when the boy cries out, high and sharp before breaking into breathless gasps as he comes, thighs shaking and head thrown back in ecstasy. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, look at you, you\u2019re so goddamn pretty,\u201d Tony whispered, stroking Peter till he was shaking and whimpering, looking up through tear stained eyes and begging for him to stop. His hand is coated in cum as he hurriedly undoes his jeans and pulls out his cock, stepping closer so he\u2019s between Peter\u2019s spread thighs as he strokes his own cock. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a mess baby,\u201d Tony whispers hoarsely, hips jolting as he strokes his cock faster. Peter watches him through hooded eyes, sweat and cum on his chest, a hungry look in his eyes as he follows the motion of Tony\u2019s hand over his cock. </p><p>\u201cYou like that? Seeing what you do to daddy?\u201d </p><p>Peter nods and leans up a little, \u201cYea daddy, I like it.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, wrist twisting as heat builds in his gut\u2014he\u2019s so close. \u201cCan I\u2014shit\u2026can I come on you baby?\u201d he asks, needing desperately to see his pretty boy all covered in his cum. </p><p>Peter nods and leans back on his elbows, grinning when Tony moans and steps even closer. The wet sound of his hand on his cock is loud in the small confines of the garage and he thinks distantly that it\u2019s a good thing the neighbors aren\u2019t too close or they\u2019d be getting an earful. </p><p>\u201cCome on daddy, cum on me,\u201d Peter whispers, staring up at him with big wide eyes and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it takes for Tony to start coming. Ropes of cum land on Peter\u2019s chest before the kid sits up suddenly and opens his mouth, the sight so dirty and depraved it rips a groan from Tony\u2019s chest. </p><p>He jerks himself harder, cursing as his cum splashes into Peter\u2019s mouth, down over his petal pink lips and over his chin. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, oh god, oh you look so good,\u201d he groans, head falling back as Peter suddenly surges forward to close his lips around the head of Tony\u2019s cock. Slim fingers join his in stroking his cock and the wet heat of his mouth has him coming undone again, loud groans echoing off the cinder block walls. </p><p>When he\u2019s shuddering from sensitivity he gently pushes Peter away, smiling down at him as he swipes his thumb under his lip and pushes it into his mouth so Peter can suck his cum off it. Peter hums and looks up at him, doe eyed and fucked out and he shivers, knowing that this is a mistake he can\u2019t take back, and one he\u2019s already thinking of repeating.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good Tony,\u201d the boy whispers, leaning back on his elbows as Tony ends the video recording and slides his phone and then cock away. </p><p>The sound of an engine rumbling drags his attention away from Peter and out the garage window to where Harley is parking his car in the driveway. Pure panic sluices thorough him\u2014\u201cHarley\u2019s back, we gotta clean you up,\u201d he tells Peter frantically. </p><p>They stumble and knock into each other as Tony grabs a greasy rag and wipes it over Peter\u2019s chest, shoving his bloody shirt at him, \u201cPut it on!\u201d he hisses, panic rising when the engine outside shuts off. They have mere moments before Harley walks in and they\u2019re not going to make it, and oh god, what\u2019s he done? </p><p>He glances at Peter who still looks fucked out despite the grease and blood on his shirt, and shit, he shouldn\u2019t enjoy it as much as he does, but he guesses that now he knows\u2014he\u2019s deeply fucked up.</p><p>The door crashes open just as he and Peter bend back over the engine of the car, talking too fast, but it doesn\u2019t matter because then Harley is plopping on the stool and regailing them with the story of his date. It takes a few minute before he realizes Peter\u2019s shirt is stained with blood and then they\u2019re going into the house for a change of clothes and he\u2019s alone, suddenly, and the reality of the last hour crashes down on him. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He manages to avoid being alone with Peter for three days before they wind up in the kitchen together at 2am. Peter is sitting on the island, fingers wrapped around a mug of cocoa when he walks in, pausing for a moment before shuffling over to make himself a drink. </p><p>\u201cDoes it help?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, frowning, \u201cDoes what help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alcohol. Does it help you forget what we did?\u201d</p><p>Tony stills, heart clenching painfully in his chest. He drops his head and exhales slowly before putting aside the whiskey and reaching for a mug\u2014cocoa is sounding better by the minute. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to forget,\u201d he murmurs, popping the k-cup into the Keurig and setting it to run before he turns around. Peter is eyeing him skeptically, the hurt in the back of his gaze making Tony\u2019s brow furrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I hurt you,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019ve just been\u2026\u201d he trails off and runs a hand through his hair, \u201cthinking. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a noncommittal sound and sips his cocoa, \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asks softly, hopefully. </p><p>\u201cChrist, Pete, yea I enjoyed it,\u201d he says with a disbelieving laugh, \u201cthat\u2019s part of the issue. You\u2019re seventeen, a kid, and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld? Too mature? Not good enough?\u201d Peter supplies dryly, \u201cdo I get an opinion at all about this?\u201d he asks sharply and the words cut into Tony like little barbs. \u201cOr are you going to decide what\u2019s best for me just because you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Tony shakes his head and sighs, \u201cShit I\u2019m too tired for this,\u201d he mutters and then drops his hand, smiles tiredly at Peter and waves a hand, \u201cGo on. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him for moment and then shrugs a shoulder, \u201cI liked what happened, a lot. I\u2019ve wanted it to happen for a while, but I knew you didn\u2019t see me like that. I understand if you think I\u2019m not ready for sex or a relationship, but, well, I\u2019ve waited this long, I can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach plummets at that because shit, that\u2019s exactly what he doesn\u2019t want. He doesn\u2019t want to string Peter along for years while he gets comfortable with the idea of fucking a teenager, but he doesn\u2019t want to let him go either. He loves the kid, more than is appropriate, and he just has to figure out what the hell he\u2019s supposed to do now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to wait for me Peter, that\u2019s not fair to you,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing a hand over his face again. </p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2026we took it slow?\u201d Peter offers and he glances up to find the kid watching him with a wary, hopeful expression. </p><p>Tony contemplates that while he sips his cocoa; in a year Peter would be headed off to MIT and be 18, finally on his own and ready to experience the wild world of college life. Can they make that, plus a long distance relationship work? </p><p>He scoffs at himself, because really, he already knows he\u2019s going to try, because it\u2019s <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>Setting aside his mug he stands up from where he\u2019s been leaning on the counter and crosses the short distance between them, hands landing gently on Peter\u2019s knees. He watches as the boy goes wide eyed and then slowly pushes his knees apart, hands sliding up his thighs to his hips.</p><p>Peter gasps softly, lips pink and inviting, and Tony leans up till his lips are very neatly pressed against them. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you want baby,\u201d Tony murmurs, watching as Peter shudders, eyes drooping with lust. Lithe arms wind around his shoulders and his hands at Peter\u2019s waist drag him closer\u2014hip to hip so he can feel the erection the kid is already sporting. </p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Tony nods and kisses him softly, \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>Peter melts into his kiss, sighing happily as Tony presses against him, hands demanding and firm on his body. They abandon cocoa for Tony\u2019s bed, and despite the urge for more, Tony takes his time in kissing Peter, running his hands over his body till he\u2019s as familiar with it as he is his own. </p><p>Peter falls asleep after Tony wrings his body dry with his hands and mouth, body lax in that way that can only come from hard physical labor or extremely satisfying orgasms. Tony watches him sleep, fingers running through his hair slowly, a faint smile on his lips. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a mistake, maybe it\u2019ll end badly, or maybe\u2026</p><p>Maybe it\u2019ll be the best thing he\u2019s ever done.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>ayyyyyeeeee, it\u2019s daddy tony!!

They\u2019ve been inseparable since Peter and his aunt had moved in next door three years ago. Peter was just on the edge of 14, weeks from his birthday and upon meeting Harley had found a friend for life.</p><p>It\u2019s three weeks to Peter\u2019s 17th birthday and Tony and May have been planning his party for months. The vintage VW Bug he\u2019s purchased for Peter would be an extravagant gift if it wasn\u2019t a rusted out junker that would need a full year of work to get it operational.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"332\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba23a9f8c45d69806ef82c8c36ca893/tumblr_inline_po86eoMotc1svcrbn_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"332\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>He had told May of his plans to have he and Peter work on the vehicle together so the kid would learn practical skills in mechanical engineering, a topic he knew fascinated Peter. He\u2019d assured her he\u2019d cover the cost of parts, and so long as Peter kept his grades up, he\u2019d get the keys to the vehicle the day he turned 18.</p><p>He\u2019d done the same thing for Harley and the two years of hard work had paid off\u2014the shiny cherry red 76 Camaro was parked in the driveway and had earned Harley a full ride to the local technical college and the offer of a job from a local garage. </p><p>He hopes that Peter will have as much fun working on the car with him; the kid is naturally curious and staggeringly smart, so Tony\u2019s sure he\u2019ll pick up quickly on the skills needed to repair the vehicle that\u2019s now waiting in the garage, covered by a tarp, just waiting to be revealed on his birthday. </p><p>The screeching of the screen door draws his attention to where Peter is careening around the corner, eyes going wide as his wet feet slip on the tile. He watches in slow motion as Peter falls forward, right for the sharp corner of the granite countertop. </p><p>He\u2019s moving before he realizes it, grabbing Peter\u2019s arms and hauling him up, mere breaths before he slams into the unforgiving stone. His heart beats too fast as he holds onto the kid for just a beat longer than normal, one hand plastered to the wet skin of his back. </p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he breathes, pulling back to run an assessing gaze over Peter, free hand tangling in those soft brown curls. \u201cYou gotta slow down kid, I don\u2019t want to have to take you to the hospital again. Your Aunt almost murdered me last time.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushes and nods, glancing away as he bites his lip, \u201cSorry Tony,\u201d he murmurs, looking up through his lashes at Tony. He worries at his lower lip with his teeth and Tony watches as it turns a rosy shade of pink at the attention, wet and shiny and something curls warm and wanting through his gut. </p><p>Clearing his throat he steps back and pats the kid\u2019s shoulder awkwardly, \u201cGreat, uh, dinner in thirty,\u201d he mutters before turning away and attempting to focus his attention on the chicken kebabs he had been working on. </p><p>He listens to Peter rustling through the fridge for a snack before he disappears back out to the pool, laughing loudly at something Harley says too softly for him to hear. Glancing out the window, he watches as Peter throws his head back, eyes shut as he laughs, stepping back and then swaying as he loses his balance on the edge of the pool and promptly falls in with a shriek. </p><p>Tony can\u2019t help the laugh that bursts out, affection warm in his chest. He continues skewering chicken and vegetables, the earlier moment with Peter pushed far from his mind. </p><p>The further from his mind, the better.\u00a0</p>[[MORE]]<p>His old friend insomnia makes a vicious return for him and he finds himself wandering the house nearly every night for two weeks, somehow managing to survive on three hours a night, exhaustion sinking deep into his bones. </p><p>He\u2019s in his study for the fourth night in a row this week working on sketches for zero emission engines he\u2019s been tinkering with lately and despite his mind numbing exhaustion he\u2019s getting further on them than he has in the past year. </p><p>Footsteps creak on the floor behind him and he turns, smiling tiredly when he sees Peter, hovering in the doorway, the long sleeves of his sweater hanging to his knuckles, looking small in the oversized fabric. He gives Tony a weak smile and waves before shuffling over and peering down at the sketch, thin fingers trailing over the paper slowly. </p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Tony asks, studying the young man, noting the dark circles beneath his eyes, much like his own. </p><p>Peter nods and leans on the desk, head bowed. \u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d he murmurs hoarsely, \u201cabout Uncle Ben.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach swoops at the admission; Peter and his Uncle had been out for ice cream when a mugger murdered Ben for five bucks, leaving a twelve year old Peter to watch the man bleed out on the pavement. </p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he offers quietly, heart plummeting when Peter shakes his head and makes a soft broken noise. When his shoulders shake Tony grabs his hand and tugs, pulling him down into his lap so he can wrap his arms firmly around Peter. </p><p>Tiny hiccuping sobs make Peter\u2019s shoulders shake and Tony feels like his chest will crack under the strain of the sorrow inside him. He holds Peter tighter and tucks his head under his chin, lips pressing to his hair as Peter cries. </p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay sweetheart, you\u2019re safe, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Tony croons, hand making slow circles over his back. Tony rocks him, blinking rapidly against the tears making his throat thick, nose burying in his soft locks as he inhales the warm clean scent he instantly identifies as <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>His fingers push through Peter\u2019s hair, tugging gently before coming back to slide through again, over and over, soothing and gentle. He hears Peter\u2019s breathing hitch and pulls him closer, \u201c\u2018S that feel good?\u201d he asks, hoping that he\u2019s not hurting the kid or overstepping by offering this gentle comfort. </p><p>Peter nods and squirms in his lap and Tony tugs on his hair, \u201cJust relax kid, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he murmurs, running his fingers through Peter\u2019s hair, thumb making small circles behind his ear. Peter shudders and makes a soft noise that sounds like a moan and it occurs to him suddenly, that this is inappropriate. </p><p>When he stops caressing Peter the boy makes a low, displeased sound and arches into his hand, \u201cFeels good,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cplease?\u201d</p><p>And who is Tony to deny him? </p><p>He nods unsteadily and resumes, heat building under his skin when Peter sighs and rolls his hips, another sound coming from the boy that\u2019s positively filthy. He can hear Peter\u2019s breathing growing uneven, hot on his skin where his face is pressed to Tony\u2019s neck. </p><p>His nails drag through Peter\u2019s hair, some dark, hungry part of him wanting to hear those sounds again, and he\u2019s rewarded with a whimper from Peter, hand curling and digging into Tony\u2019s shoulder as his hips stutter upward. A quick glance down shows him the kid is hard; swallowing hard, he closes his eyes and tells himself he\u2019s just being comforting. </p><p>It\u2019s a lie, but it\u2019s one he needs to tell. </p><p>\u201cS-sorry,\u201d Peter whispers breathily, still clutching desperately to Tony\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor what kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018M not a kid,\u201d is the petulant reply, followed by a soft whine when Tony tugs on his hair experimentally. Peter goes still on his lap, breathing too fast and uneven to be anything but arousal. </p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tony asks, fingers resuming their trail through his hair and against his skin. </p><p>\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u2019s just\u2026my hair,\u201d Peter gasps, whimpering again when Tony tugs lightly. </p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d he asks, voice low and hot and Christ, he\u2019s going to hell for how it makes his cock twitch to hear Peter\u2019s breath hitch, hot and wet against his throat. </p><p>\u201cMmmhmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels good?\u201d</p><p>Peter gasps when Tony\u2019s nails scratch at his scalp, hips jolting, \u201cY-Yes, yes, <i>please</i>,\u201d he whines and <i>fuck</i>, Tony\u2019s a goner. </p><p>His free hand slides under Peter\u2019s sweater so he can drag his nails down his back, biting back a groan when the kid shudders and moans, arching into him, soft pleas whispered in his ear. \u201cPlease\u2026.Mr. Stark, please,\u201d he begs, voice cracking and shit, he should stop, this isn\u2019t right and he knows that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry kid,\u201d he grinds out, \u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d he whispers, but his hands remain on Peter and neither of them move as Peter whines and shakes his head. </p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, <i>please</i>.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His hand tightens in Peter\u2019s hair, the one at his back pressing hard in counterpoint and Peter gasps, face pressing into his neck with wet, hot breathy moans. </p><p>\u201cPlease Tony, please.\u201d</p><p>Cursing himself, he presses his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, \u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetheart, shhh, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re so good Peter, c\u2019mon sweetheart, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he rambles, feeling it when Peter shudders and moans, hips rolling up into nothing. He pets and rubs Peter, heat in his cheeks and burning low in his gut and to his shame, he realizes he too is hard. </p><p>It\u2019s just biology he tells himself, a reaction to having a pretty, aroused boy in his lap, begging to cum. It\u2019s not Peter\u2026it can\u2019t be, because then he\u2019d be a goddamn monster. </p><p>He tugs too hard on Peter\u2019s hair and feels it a moment later when the kid cries out, the sound muffled against his throat as he sobs, hips hitching, and cums. Cursing, Tony grits his teeth as Peter\u2019s hips push down against his erection, stars blooming behind his lids at the near painful pleasure he gets from his jeans rubbing into his cock.</p><p>Peter pants against his neck and Tony can feel the tears the boy has shed, apparently overcome with pleasure. A sick wave of pride swells within him that he\u2019s made Peter feel so good he\u2019s left in tears, and that same thing makes him wonder what it would be like to do it again, except this time, with Peter spread out beneath him so he can watch him plead and cry. </p><p>Eventually Peter\u2019s breathing evens out and Tony can feel him go lax in his arms, sleepy little noises making him smile. He adjusts his grip and stands, holding Peter as he ascends the stairs slowly, steps steady and quiet. He pauses for a moment, considering what the most responsible option is here, and after a moment of hesitation, heads to the end of the hallway to his bedroom. </p><p>When he tries to put Peter down and pull away, the young man makes a sleepy noise of protest and wraps his hand in Tony\u2019s T-shirt, holding onto him tightly. \u201cStay,\u201d he slurs, eyes opening in a soft flutter, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>Tony wavers for a minute and then nods, \u201cOkay kid, lemme just get you under the covers,\u201d he murmurs, gently guiding Peter\u2019s lax limbs beneath his sheets. Peter curls up and smiles sleepily at him and the sight leaves Tony momentarily breathless. </p><p>He stares at him, motionless for a moment before shaking his head and stripping quickly. He tosses his T-shirt aside and pulls on soft cotton pants, stilling when he glances up and finds Peter watching him through hooded eyes. He\u2019s seen that look on the faces of other pretty young things before he takes them to bed, but to see it now on the face of someone he considers family, whose never looked at him like that before, it makes his gut twist. </p><p>He debates not getting into bed, thinks that he should take the safer route(<b><i>hah</i></b>\u2014<i>nothing</i> is safe anymore now that he knows what Peter sounds like when he cums) and go back down to his office but Peter pouts at him and holds out a hand and he\u2019s weak, so, so <i>weak</i>, so he slides beneath the covers and moments later Peter is snuggling into him with a soft contented sound.</p><p>Pressing his lips to Peter\u2019s hair, he rubs a hand over his spine slowly, \u201cSleep sweetheart,\u201d he encourages, eyes falling shut as Peter wriggles and then sighs, tucking his face into Tony\u2019s throat. </p><p>\u201cNight Tony,\u201d he whispers, breath warm on his skin. </p><p>Tony shivers, hands tightening on him, \u201cNight kid.\u201d</p><hr><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It turns into a routine; Peter stays the night, can\u2019t sleep, and winds up in his bed before the night is through. There\u2019s no repeat of that first time in his office\u2014he\u2019s painfully careful when touching Peter now, but he sees it in his eyes, a yearning for more, and he can\u2019t deny that despite his best efforts, the memory is now at the forefront of his thoughts when he jacks off. </p><p>He knows it isn\u2019t normal, isn\u2019t safe, but he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop. He can\u2019t resist when Peter comes to him with pleading eyes and dark circles beneath his eyes. </p><p>Eventually though it\u2019s not just about insomnia, because Peter comes to his room after Harley falls asleep and slides into his bed, and if he\u2019s honest with himself it\u2019s the best sleep he\u2019s gotten in years. He shouldn\u2019t let it continue, he knows that, and yet he can\u2019t quite bring himself to stop it. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Predictably, Peter is ecstatic upon receiving his car, launching himself into Tony\u2019s arms with a grin of delight, babbling thanks as Tony laughs and hugs him back, fingers curling in soft curls to hold him closer, tighter. May\u2019s eyes sparkle and Harley grins, and it all feels\u2026right. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He\u2019s in the middle of explaining something, head under the hood of the car while he waits for Peter to find the wrench he needs, when suddenly there\u2019s a warm presence at his back. He realizes with a stutter that Peter\u2019s pressed against him, peering over his shoulder at the engine, one hand bracing in between his shoulders as the other sets down the wrench on the engine block. </p><p>Thing is, Peter doesn\u2019t move. </p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the issue?\u201d Peter asks in his ear and he realizes he\u2019s stopped talking, heat crawling up his face when Peter leans over further, hips pressing into Tony\u2019s as his fingers dig into his back. He represses a shudder at the touch and nods, goes back to explaining what they\u2019re fixing and why. </p><p>Tries to put it out of his mind. </p><p>Except, it happens again.</p><p>The next time they\u2019re working on the car it seems like Peter brushes into or against him any chance he can, hands lingering unnecessarily while he gazes at Tony through hooded eyes. </p><p>He ignores it, or does his best to anyway, but it\u2019s hard to ignore when the kid is in his bed every night he stays over. He\u2019d say something to May about changing her shifts, but he knows they pay more for third shift, and there\u2019s a very large part of him that doesn\u2019t want it to stop because then he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep so he says nothing. </p><p>It\u2019s just Peter he tries to reason, the kid he\u2019s known since his voice was cracking, the kid who is, essentially, family. It\u2019s just an infatuation, he assures himself, nothing to worry about. </p><p>Except he can\u2019t get it out of his head, the sounds he made, the way he gasped Tony\u2019s name, the shudder he\u2019d felt beneath his palms as he came. </p><p>It\u2019s a goddamn nightmare is what it is. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Everything comes to a head one evening while he and Peter work on the Bug\u2014May at work and Harley on a date. Tony has worked hard to avoid being alone like this with Peter\u2014but still hasn\u2019t managed to keep him from his bed. </p><p>He offhandedly orders Peter to stop fucking around with the box cutter, head beneath the hood of the car while he twists at the bolt he\u2019s been trying to loosen for five minutes when he hears Peter curse. When he comes up, he finds Peter shirtless, fabric wrapped around his palm where he\u2019s apparently cut himself. </p><p>Panic sluices through Tony and he slams the hood of the car shut, grabs Peter and makes him sit, ignoring his protests of <i>I\u2019m fine Tony, honestly</i>, in favor of grabbing his first aid kit and stool. Tossing the kit on the hood, he slides his glasses up his nose and unwraps the shirt, grimacing in sympathy. </p><p>It\u2019s a deep cut, but not too long, half an inch and easily taken care of. He cleans it, eyes shooting up to Peter\u2019s face when he hisses, shaking his head when he looks back down at the wound. </p><p>\u201cI told you to be careful,\u201d he mutters. </p><p>\u201cI was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmhm, that\u2019s why I\u2019m bandaging up your hand, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, honestly, doesn\u2019t even hurt that bad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine,\u201d Tony replies through clenched teeth, his carefully held control wavering at the sight of Peter\u2019s blood on his hands. \u201cI tell you to do something while we\u2019re working, you do it. There are dangerous tools in here and if I tell you to stop touching something, you need to <i>listen</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYea well, you\u2019re not my dad.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s hands still, anger and disbelief surging up within him as he lifts his gaze to find Peter staring down at him defiantly. He\u2019s almost proud of the kid, for showing that kind of defiance to a person he\u2019s normally so deferential with, but it\u2019s not enough to override the annoyance. </p><p>\u201cGood thing you\u2019re not my kid then, or I\u2019d bend you over the hood of this car and turn your ass red.\u201d</p><p>Peter flushes pink, swallowing hard as a broken noise hitches out of his throat. Tony\u2019s gaze is hungry on his lips, bitten red and wet from where he\u2019s licked them, parted around breathless little pants. His pupils eat up the warm brown of his irises, eyes glazed with lust and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut. </p><p>\u201cOr maybe you <i>want</i> me to punish you,\u201d Tony muses, gaze flickering over the lithe muscular planes of Peter\u2019s chest, skin creamy under the pale lights in the garage, nipples blush pink and hard. \u201cHmm, is that what you want kid? You need a spanking?\u201d</p><p>At this Peter whines and the blush on his cheeks extends down to his chest and it\u2019s such a pretty sight it makes Tony\u2019s gut twist with the urge to dirty him up. Surging forward, he grabs the back of Peter\u2019s neck and hauls him to his feet, spinning him around so his chest is pressed to the cold metal, grinning when he gasps and arches away from the sensation.</p><p>Peter\u2019s cheek is pressed to the side and when Tony\u2019s hand slips under him to tug at his belt, Peter whispers, \u201cYea daddy, ruin me,\u201d and <i>fuck</i>, Tony loses it. Growling, he bends down and bites the back of Peter\u2019s neck, hand shoving into his jeans and briefs to close around the kids cock, a low groan rumbling out of his chest at the feel of his hot, wet skin. </p><p>Peter whines and arches his hips, <i>daddy</i> falling from his wet, shiny lips. Tony leaves another mark on his shoulder as he starts stroking him, heat surging in his veins as Peter writhes and moans, ass pressing back into Tony\u2019s groin. </p><p>He wants to see Peter\u2019s face, needs it, so he pulls back and turns the kid, shoving him back so his shoulders hit the metal with a dull clang, surging down to kiss him before he\u2019s fully able to protest the loss of Tony\u2019s hand on his cock. Peter mewls into the kiss, desperate and loud as Tony licks into his mouth, just as desperate as the kid.</p><p>His hands fumble with Peter\u2019s belt and jeans for a moment before he\u2019s got them pulled down his thighs, freeing his cock so he finally gets a look at it. Groaning, he wraps his hand around it and strokes slowly as he pulls on Peter\u2019s hair, tugging his head back so he can mark up his throat too. </p><p>\u201cLook at you sweetheart, all wet and moaning for daddy,\u201d he pants, \u201cyou daddy\u2019s desperate little slut?\u201d he demands, grinning against Peter\u2019s throat when he moans and nods, hips rolling up so his cock slides through Tony\u2019s hand. </p><p>He digs in with avaricious pleasure, mouth sliding down to leave deep red marks on the creamy skin of Peter\u2019s chest. \u201cGonna mark you up baby, let everyone know who you belong to,\u201d he rasps, heat curling through his belly when Peter nods and arches, pleading in soft breathy gasps. </p><p>Stroking Peter\u2019s cock a little faster, he focuses his attention on those pretty little nipples, sucking and biting until they\u2019re red, swollen and so sensitive that Peter sobs at the slightest touch. He pulls back a moment just to admire the sight beneath him; hair in disarray, lips bitten and wet, marks all over his skin, cock leaking hard in his grasp\u2026</p><p>\u201cChrist kid, I aughta take a picture, you\u2019re a goddamn work of art,\u201d he groans, brows rising when Peter nods and moans, hips arching into his hand. </p><p>\u201cPlease? Please,\u201d Peter begs brokenly and Tony\u2019s mouth goes dry; hand fumbling into his back pocket he pulls out his phone and opens the camera, snaps a few pictures and then pauses, switches it to the video function with a low burning of guilt and shame in the back of his throat.</p><p>Holding the phone in one hand and Peter\u2019s cock in the other, he strokes him, wrist twisting and thumb digging into the red, throbbing head hard enough to have Peter arching up off the rusted metal beneath him, more cum pulsing out as his thighs quiver.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026please!\u201d</p><p>Tony groans softly and nods, jerking him faster, \u201cC\u2019mon baby, come for daddy, let me hear you,\u201d he demands throatily, his own cock hard behind his zipper. He focuses his attention on the head of Peter\u2019s cock and is rewarded when the boy cries out, high and sharp before breaking into breathless gasps as he comes, thighs shaking and head thrown back in ecstasy. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, look at you, you\u2019re so goddamn pretty,\u201d Tony whispered, stroking Peter till he was shaking and whimpering, looking up through tear stained eyes and begging for him to stop. His hand is coated in cum as he hurriedly undoes his jeans and pulls out his cock, stepping closer so he\u2019s between Peter\u2019s spread thighs as he strokes his own cock. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a mess baby,\u201d Tony whispers hoarsely, hips jolting as he strokes his cock faster. Peter watches him through hooded eyes, sweat and cum on his chest, a hungry look in his eyes as he follows the motion of Tony\u2019s hand over his cock. </p><p>\u201cYou like that? Seeing what you do to daddy?\u201d </p><p>Peter nods and leans up a little, \u201cYea daddy, I like it.\u201d</p><p>Tony groans, wrist twisting as heat builds in his gut\u2014he\u2019s so close. \u201cCan I\u2014shit\u2026can I come on you baby?\u201d he asks, needing desperately to see his pretty boy all covered in his cum. </p><p>Peter nods and leans back on his elbows, grinning when Tony moans and steps even closer. The wet sound of his hand on his cock is loud in the small confines of the garage and he thinks distantly that it\u2019s a good thing the neighbors aren\u2019t too close or they\u2019d be getting an earful. </p><p>\u201cCome on daddy, cum on me,\u201d Peter whispers, staring up at him with big wide eyes and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all it takes for Tony to start coming. Ropes of cum land on Peter\u2019s chest before the kid sits up suddenly and opens his mouth, the sight so dirty and depraved it rips a groan from Tony\u2019s chest. </p><p>He jerks himself harder, cursing as his cum splashes into Peter\u2019s mouth, down over his petal pink lips and over his chin. </p><p>\u201cFuck baby, oh god, oh you look so good,\u201d he groans, head falling back as Peter suddenly surges forward to close his lips around the head of Tony\u2019s cock. Slim fingers join his in stroking his cock and the wet heat of his mouth has him coming undone again, loud groans echoing off the cinder block walls. </p><p>When he\u2019s shuddering from sensitivity he gently pushes Peter away, smiling down at him as he swipes his thumb under his lip and pushes it into his mouth so Peter can suck his cum off it. Peter hums and looks up at him, doe eyed and fucked out and he shivers, knowing that this is a mistake he can\u2019t take back, and one he\u2019s already thinking of repeating.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good Tony,\u201d the boy whispers, leaning back on his elbows as Tony ends the video recording and slides his phone and then cock away. </p><p>The sound of an engine rumbling drags his attention away from Peter and out the garage window to where Harley is parking his car in the driveway. Pure panic sluices thorough him\u2014\u201cHarley\u2019s back, we gotta clean you up,\u201d he tells Peter frantically. </p><p>They stumble and knock into each other as Tony grabs a greasy rag and wipes it over Peter\u2019s chest, shoving his bloody shirt at him, \u201cPut it on!\u201d he hisses, panic rising when the engine outside shuts off. They have mere moments before Harley walks in and they\u2019re not going to make it, and oh god, what\u2019s he done? </p><p>He glances at Peter who still looks fucked out despite the grease and blood on his shirt, and shit, he shouldn\u2019t enjoy it as much as he does, but he guesses that now he knows\u2014he\u2019s deeply fucked up.</p><p>The door crashes open just as he and Peter bend back over the engine of the car, talking too fast, but it doesn\u2019t matter because then Harley is plopping on the stool and regailing them with the story of his date. It takes a few minute before he realizes Peter\u2019s shirt is stained with blood and then they\u2019re going into the house for a change of clothes and he\u2019s alone, suddenly, and the reality of the last hour crashes down on him. </p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He manages to avoid being alone with Peter for three days before they wind up in the kitchen together at 2am. Peter is sitting on the island, fingers wrapped around a mug of cocoa when he walks in, pausing for a moment before shuffling over to make himself a drink. </p><p>\u201cDoes it help?\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, frowning, \u201cDoes what help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alcohol. Does it help you forget what we did?\u201d</p><p>Tony stills, heart clenching painfully in his chest. He drops his head and exhales slowly before putting aside the whiskey and reaching for a mug\u2014cocoa is sounding better by the minute. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to forget,\u201d he murmurs, popping the k-cup into the Keurig and setting it to run before he turns around. Peter is eyeing him skeptically, the hurt in the back of his gaze making Tony\u2019s brow furrow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I hurt you,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI\u2019ve just been\u2026\u201d he trails off and runs a hand through his hair, \u201cthinking. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Peter makes a noncommittal sound and sips his cocoa, \u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asks softly, hopefully. </p><p>\u201cChrist, Pete, yea I enjoyed it,\u201d he says with a disbelieving laugh, \u201cthat\u2019s part of the issue. You\u2019re seventeen, a kid, and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld? Too mature? Not good enough?\u201d Peter supplies dryly, \u201cdo I get an opinion at all about this?\u201d he asks sharply and the words cut into Tony like little barbs. \u201cOr are you going to decide what\u2019s best for me just because you\u2019re older?\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Tony shakes his head and sighs, \u201cShit I\u2019m too tired for this,\u201d he mutters and then drops his hand, smiles tiredly at Peter and waves a hand, \u201cGo on. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Peter stares at him for moment and then shrugs a shoulder, \u201cI liked what happened, a lot. I\u2019ve wanted it to happen for a while, but I knew you didn\u2019t see me like that. I understand if you think I\u2019m not ready for sex or a relationship, but, well, I\u2019ve waited this long, I can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s stomach plummets at that because shit, that\u2019s exactly what he doesn\u2019t want. He doesn\u2019t want to string Peter along for years while he gets comfortable with the idea of fucking a teenager, but he doesn\u2019t want to let him go either. He loves the kid, more than is appropriate, and he just has to figure out what the hell he\u2019s supposed to do now. </p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to wait for me Peter, that\u2019s not fair to you,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing a hand over his face again. </p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2026we took it slow?\u201d Peter offers and he glances up to find the kid watching him with a wary, hopeful expression. </p><p>Tony contemplates that while he sips his cocoa; in a year Peter would be headed off to MIT and be 18, finally on his own and ready to experience the wild world of college life. Can they make that, plus a long distance relationship work? </p><p>He scoffs at himself, because really, he already knows he\u2019s going to try, because it\u2019s <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>Setting aside his mug he stands up from where he\u2019s been leaning on the counter and crosses the short distance between them, hands landing gently on Peter\u2019s knees. He watches as the boy goes wide eyed and then slowly pushes his knees apart, hands sliding up his thighs to his hips.</p><p>Peter gasps softly, lips pink and inviting, and Tony leans up till his lips are very neatly pressed against them. </p><p>\u201cWhatever you want baby,\u201d Tony murmurs, watching as Peter shudders, eyes drooping with lust. Lithe arms wind around his shoulders and his hands at Peter\u2019s waist drag him closer\u2014hip to hip so he can feel the erection the kid is already sporting. </p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Tony nods and kisses him softly, \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>Peter melts into his kiss, sighing happily as Tony presses against him, hands demanding and firm on his body. They abandon cocoa for Tony\u2019s bed, and despite the urge for more, Tony takes his time in kissing Peter, running his hands over his body till he\u2019s as familiar with it as he is his own. </p><p>Peter falls asleep after Tony wrings his body dry with his hands and mouth, body lax in that way that can only come from hard physical labor or extremely satisfying orgasms. Tony watches him sleep, fingers running through his hair slowly, a faint smile on his lips. </p><p>Maybe it\u2019s a mistake, maybe it\u2019ll end badly, or maybe\u2026</p><p>Maybe it\u2019ll be the best thing he\u2019s ever done.\u00a0</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>ayyyyyeeeee, it\u2019s daddy tony!!

Peter was just on the edge of 14, weeks from his birthday and upon meeting Harley had found a friend for life.</p><p>It&rsquo;s three weeks to Peter&rsquo;s 17th birthday and Tony and May have been planning his party for months.

He&rsquo;d assured her he&rsquo;d cover the cost of parts, and so long as Peter kept his grades up, he&rsquo;d get the keys to the vehicle the day he turned 18.</p><p>He&rsquo;d done the same thing for Harley and the two years of hard work had paid off&mdash;the shiny cherry red 76 Camaro was parked in the driveway and had earned Harley a full ride to the local technical college and the offer of a job from a local garage. </p><p>He hopes that Peter will have as much fun working on the car with him; the kid is naturally curious and staggeringly smart, so Tony&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;ll pick up quickly on the skills needed to repair the vehicle that&rsquo;s now waiting in the garage, covered by a tarp, just waiting to be revealed on his birthday. </p><p>The screeching of the screen door draws his attention to where Peter is careening around the corner, eyes going wide as his wet feet slip on the tile. He watches in slow motion as Peter falls forward, right for the sharp corner of the granite countertop. </p><p>He&rsquo;s moving before he realizes it, grabbing Peter&rsquo;s arms and hauling him up, mere breaths before he slams into the unforgiving stone. His heart beats too fast as he holds onto the kid for just a beat longer than normal, one hand plastered to the wet skin of his back. </p><p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; he breathes, pulling back to run an assessing gaze over Peter, free hand tangling in those soft brown curls. &ldquo;You gotta slow down kid, I don&rsquo;t want to have to take you to the hospital again. Your Aunt almost murdered me last time.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter flushes and nods, glancing away as he bites his lip, &ldquo;Sorry Tony,&rdquo; he murmurs, looking up through his lashes at Tony. He worries at his lower lip with his teeth and Tony watches as it turns a rosy shade of pink at the attention, wet and shiny and something curls warm and wanting through his gut. </p><p>Clearing his throat he steps back and pats the kid&rsquo;s shoulder awkwardly, &ldquo;Great, uh, dinner in thirty,&rdquo; he mutters before turning away and attempting to focus his attention on the chicken kebabs he had been working on. </p><p>He listens to Peter rustling through the fridge for a snack before he disappears back out to the pool, laughing loudly at something Harley says too softly for him to hear. Glancing out the window, he watches as Peter throws his head back, eyes shut as he laughs, stepping back and then swaying as he loses his balance on the edge of the pool and promptly falls in with a shriek. </p><p>Tony can&rsquo;t help the laugh that bursts out, affection warm in his chest. He continues skewering chicken and vegetables, the earlier moment with Peter pushed far from his mind. </p><p>The further from his mind, the better.&nbsp;</p><p>His old friend insomnia makes a vicious return for him and he finds himself wandering the house nearly every night for two weeks, somehow managing to survive on three hours a night, exhaustion sinking deep into his bones. </p><p>He&rsquo;s in his study for the fourth night in a row this week working on sketches for zero emission engines he&rsquo;s been tinkering with lately and despite his mind numbing exhaustion he&rsquo;s getting further on them than he has in the past year. </p><p>Footsteps creak on the floor behind him and he turns, smiling tiredly when he sees Peter, hovering in the doorway, the long sleeves of his sweater hanging to his knuckles, looking small in the oversized fabric. He gives Tony a weak smile and waves before shuffling over and peering down at the sketch, thin fingers trailing over the paper slowly. </p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo; Tony asks, studying the young man, noting the dark circles beneath his eyes, much like his own. </p><p>Peter nods and leans on the desk, head bowed. &ldquo;I had a nightmare,&rdquo; he murmurs hoarsely, &ldquo;about Uncle Ben.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s stomach swoops at the admission; Peter and his Uncle had been out for ice cream when a mugger murdered Ben for five bucks, leaving a twelve year old Peter to watch the man bleed out on the pavement. </p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; he offers quietly, heart plummeting when Peter shakes his head and makes a soft broken noise. When his shoulders shake Tony grabs his hand and tugs, pulling him down into his lap so he can wrap his arms firmly around Peter. </p><p>Tiny hiccuping sobs make Peter&rsquo;s shoulders shake and Tony feels like his chest will crack under the strain of the sorrow inside him. He holds Peter tighter and tucks his head under his chin, lips pressing to his hair as Peter cries. </p><p>&ldquo;Shhh, it&rsquo;s okay sweetheart, you&rsquo;re safe, I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; Tony croons, hand making slow circles over his back. Tony rocks him, blinking rapidly against the tears making his throat thick, nose burying in his soft locks as he inhales the warm clean scent he instantly identifies as <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>His fingers push through Peter&rsquo;s hair, tugging gently before coming back to slide through again, over and over, soothing and gentle. He hears Peter&rsquo;s breathing hitch and pulls him closer, &ldquo;&lsquo;S that feel good?&rdquo; he asks, hoping that he&rsquo;s not hurting the kid or overstepping by offering this gentle comfort. </p><p>Peter nods and squirms in his lap and Tony tugs on his hair, &ldquo;Just relax kid, I&rsquo;ve got you,&rdquo; he murmurs, running his fingers through Peter&rsquo;s hair, thumb making small circles behind his ear. Peter shudders and makes a soft noise that sounds like a moan and it occurs to him suddenly, that this is inappropriate. </p><p>When he stops caressing Peter the boy makes a low, displeased sound and arches into his hand, &ldquo;Feels good,&rdquo; he murmurs, &ldquo;please?&rdquo;</p><p>And who is Tony to deny him? </p><p>He nods unsteadily and resumes, heat building under his skin when Peter sighs and rolls his hips, another sound coming from the boy that&rsquo;s positively filthy. He can hear Peter&rsquo;s breathing growing uneven, hot on his skin where his face is pressed to Tony&rsquo;s neck. </p><p>His nails drag through Peter&rsquo;s hair, some dark, hungry part of him wanting to hear those sounds again, and he&rsquo;s rewarded with a whimper from Peter, hand curling and digging into Tony&rsquo;s shoulder as his hips stutter upward. A quick glance down shows him the kid is hard; swallowing hard, he closes his eyes and tells himself he&rsquo;s just being comforting. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a lie, but it&rsquo;s one he needs to tell. </p><p>&ldquo;S-sorry,&rdquo; Peter whispers breathily, still clutching desperately to Tony&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;For what kid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M not a kid,&rdquo; is the petulant reply, followed by a soft whine when Tony tugs on his hair experimentally. Peter goes still on his lap, breathing too fast and uneven to be anything but arousal. </p><p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Tony asks, fingers resuming their trail through his hair and against his skin. </p><p>&ldquo;Y-yeah&hellip;&rsquo;s just&hellip;my hair,&rdquo; Peter gasps, whimpering again when Tony tugs lightly. </p><p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; he asks, voice low and hot and Christ, he&rsquo;s going to hell for how it makes his cock twitch to hear Peter&rsquo;s breath hitch, hot and wet against his throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Mmmhmmm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Feels good?&rdquo;</p><p>Peter gasps when Tony&rsquo;s nails scratch at his scalp, hips jolting, &ldquo;Y-Yes, yes, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; he whines and <i>fuck</i>, Tony&rsquo;s a goner. </p><p>His free hand slides under Peter&rsquo;s sweater so he can drag his nails down his back, biting back a groan when the kid shudders and moans, arching into him, soft pleas whispered in his ear. &ldquo;Please&hellip;.Mr. Stark, please,&rdquo; he begs, voice cracking and shit, he should stop, this isn&rsquo;t right and he knows that.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry kid,&rdquo; he grinds out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop,&rdquo; he whispers, but his hands remain on Peter and neither of them move as Peter whines and shakes his head. </p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, <i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His hand tightens in Peter&rsquo;s hair, the one at his back pressing hard in counterpoint and Peter gasps, face pressing into his neck with wet, hot breathy moans. </p><p>&ldquo;Please Tony, please.&rdquo;</p><p>Cursing himself, he presses his lips to Peter&rsquo;s hair, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay sweetheart, shhh, you&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;re so good Peter, c&rsquo;mon sweetheart, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he rambles, feeling it when Peter shudders and moans, hips rolling up into nothing. He pets and rubs Peter, heat in his cheeks and burning low in his gut and to his shame, he realizes he too is hard. </p><p>It&rsquo;s just biology he tells himself, a reaction to having a pretty, aroused boy in his lap, begging to cum. It&rsquo;s not Peter&hellip;it can&rsquo;t be, because then he&rsquo;d be a goddamn monster. </p><p>He tugs too hard on Peter&rsquo;s hair and feels it a moment later when the kid cries out, the sound muffled against his throat as he sobs, hips hitching, and cums. Cursing, Tony grits his teeth as Peter&rsquo;s hips push down against his erection, stars blooming behind his lids at the near painful pleasure he gets from his jeans rubbing into his cock.</p><p>Peter pants against his neck and Tony can feel the tears the boy has shed, apparently overcome with pleasure. A sick wave of pride swells within him that he&rsquo;s made Peter feel so good he&rsquo;s left in tears, and that same thing makes him wonder what it would be like to do it again, except this time, with Peter spread out beneath him so he can watch him plead and cry. </p><p>Eventually Peter&rsquo;s breathing evens out and Tony can feel him go lax in his arms, sleepy little noises making him smile. He adjusts his grip and stands, holding Peter as he ascends the stairs slowly, steps steady and quiet. He pauses for a moment, considering what the most responsible option is here, and after a moment of hesitation, heads to the end of the hallway to his bedroom. </p><p>When he tries to put Peter down and pull away, the young man makes a sleepy noise of protest and wraps his hand in Tony&rsquo;s T-shirt, holding onto him tightly. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he slurs, eyes opening in a soft flutter, &ldquo;please.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony wavers for a minute and then nods, &ldquo;Okay kid, lemme just get you under the covers,&rdquo; he murmurs, gently guiding Peter&rsquo;s lax limbs beneath his sheets. Peter curls up and smiles sleepily at him and the sight leaves Tony momentarily breathless. </p><p>He stares at him, motionless for a moment before shaking his head and stripping quickly. He tosses his T-shirt aside and pulls on soft cotton pants, stilling when he glances up and finds Peter watching him through hooded eyes. He&rsquo;s seen that look on the faces of other pretty young things before he takes them to bed, but to see it now on the face of someone he considers family, whose never looked at him like that before, it makes his gut twist. </p><p>He debates not getting into bed, thinks that he should take the safer route(<b><i>hah</i></b>&mdash;<i>nothing</i> is safe anymore now that he knows what Peter sounds like when he cums) and go back down to his office but Peter pouts at him and holds out a hand and he&rsquo;s weak, so, so <i>weak</i>, so he slides beneath the covers and moments later Peter is snuggling into him with a soft contented sound.</p><p>Pressing his lips to Peter&rsquo;s hair, he rubs a hand over his spine slowly, &ldquo;Sleep sweetheart,&rdquo; he encourages, eyes falling shut as Peter wriggles and then sighs, tucking his face into Tony&rsquo;s throat. </p><p>&ldquo;Night Tony,&rdquo; he whispers, breath warm on his skin. </p><p>Tony shivers, hands tightening on him, &ldquo;Night kid.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It turns into a routine; Peter stays the night, can&rsquo;t sleep, and winds up in his bed before the night is through. There&rsquo;s no repeat of that first time in his office&mdash;he&rsquo;s painfully careful when touching Peter now, but he sees it in his eyes, a yearning for more, and he can&rsquo;t deny that despite his best efforts, the memory is now at the forefront of his thoughts when he jacks off. </p><p>He knows it isn&rsquo;t normal, isn&rsquo;t safe, but he can&rsquo;t quite bring himself to stop. He can&rsquo;t resist when Peter comes to him with pleading eyes and dark circles beneath his eyes. </p><p>Eventually though it&rsquo;s not just about insomnia, because Peter comes to his room after Harley falls asleep and slides into his bed, and if he&rsquo;s honest with himself it&rsquo;s the best sleep he&rsquo;s gotten in years. He shouldn&rsquo;t let it continue, he knows that, and yet he can&rsquo;t quite bring himself to stop it. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Predictably, Peter is ecstatic upon receiving his car, launching himself into Tony&rsquo;s arms with a grin of delight, babbling thanks as Tony laughs and hugs him back, fingers curling in soft curls to hold him closer, tighter. May&rsquo;s eyes sparkle and Harley grins, and it all feels&hellip;right. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He&rsquo;s in the middle of explaining something, head under the hood of the car while he waits for Peter to find the wrench he needs, when suddenly there&rsquo;s a warm presence at his back. He realizes with a stutter that Peter&rsquo;s pressed against him, peering over his shoulder at the engine, one hand bracing in between his shoulders as the other sets down the wrench on the engine block. </p><p>Thing is, Peter doesn&rsquo;t move. </p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the issue?&rdquo; Peter asks in his ear and he realizes he&rsquo;s stopped talking, heat crawling up his face when Peter leans over further, hips pressing into Tony&rsquo;s as his fingers dig into his back. He represses a shudder at the touch and nods, goes back to explaining what they&rsquo;re fixing and why. </p><p>Tries to put it out of his mind. </p><p>Except, it happens again.</p><p>The next time they&rsquo;re working on the car it seems like Peter brushes into or against him any chance he can, hands lingering unnecessarily while he gazes at Tony through hooded eyes. </p><p>He ignores it, or does his best to anyway, but it&rsquo;s hard to ignore when the kid is in his bed every night he stays over. He&rsquo;d say something to May about changing her shifts, but he knows they pay more for third shift, and there&rsquo;s a very large part of him that doesn&rsquo;t want it to stop because then he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sleep so he says nothing. </p><p>It&rsquo;s just Peter he tries to reason, the kid he&rsquo;s known since his voice was cracking, the kid who is, essentially, family. It&rsquo;s just an infatuation, he assures himself, nothing to worry about. </p><p>Except he can&rsquo;t get it out of his head, the sounds he made, the way he gasped Tony&rsquo;s name, the shudder he&rsquo;d felt beneath his palms as he came. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a goddamn nightmare is what it is. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Everything comes to a head one evening while he and Peter work on the Bug&mdash;May at work and Harley on a date. Tony has worked hard to avoid being alone like this with Peter&mdash;but still hasn&rsquo;t managed to keep him from his bed. </p><p>He offhandedly orders Peter to stop fucking around with the box cutter, head beneath the hood of the car while he twists at the bolt he&rsquo;s been trying to loosen for five minutes when he hears Peter curse. When he comes up, he finds Peter shirtless, fabric wrapped around his palm where he&rsquo;s apparently cut himself. </p><p>Panic sluices through Tony and he slams the hood of the car shut, grabs Peter and makes him sit, ignoring his protests of <i>I&rsquo;m fine Tony, honestly</i>, in favor of grabbing his first aid kit and stool. Tossing the kit on the hood, he slides his glasses up his nose and unwraps the shirt, grimacing in sympathy. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a deep cut, but not too long, half an inch and easily taken care of. He cleans it, eyes shooting up to Peter&rsquo;s face when he hisses, shaking his head when he looks back down at the wound. </p><p>&ldquo;I told you to be careful,&rdquo; he mutters. </p><p>&ldquo;I was!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mmhm, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m bandaging up your hand, hmm?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, honestly, doesn&rsquo;t even hurt that bad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fine,&rdquo; Tony replies through clenched teeth, his carefully held control wavering at the sight of Peter&rsquo;s blood on his hands. &ldquo;I tell you to do something while we&rsquo;re working, you do it. There are dangerous tools in here and if I tell you to stop touching something, you need to <i>listen</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yea well, you&rsquo;re not my dad.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s hands still, anger and disbelief surging up within him as he lifts his gaze to find Peter staring down at him defiantly. He&rsquo;s almost proud of the kid, for showing that kind of defiance to a person he&rsquo;s normally so deferential with, but it&rsquo;s not enough to override the annoyance. </p><p>&ldquo;Good thing you&rsquo;re not my kid then, or I&rsquo;d bend you over the hood of this car and turn your ass red.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter flushes pink, swallowing hard as a broken noise hitches out of his throat. Tony&rsquo;s gaze is hungry on his lips, bitten red and wet from where he&rsquo;s licked them, parted around breathless little pants. His pupils eat up the warm brown of his irises, eyes glazed with lust and it hits Tony like a punch to the gut. </p><p>&ldquo;Or maybe you <i>want</i> me to punish you,&rdquo; Tony muses, gaze flickering over the lithe muscular planes of Peter&rsquo;s chest, skin creamy under the pale lights in the garage, nipples blush pink and hard. &ldquo;Hmm, is that what you want kid? You need a spanking?&rdquo;</p><p>At this Peter whines and the blush on his cheeks extends down to his chest and it&rsquo;s such a pretty sight it makes Tony&rsquo;s gut twist with the urge to dirty him up. Surging forward, he grabs the back of Peter&rsquo;s neck and hauls him to his feet, spinning him around so his chest is pressed to the cold metal, grinning when he gasps and arches away from the sensation.</p><p>Peter&rsquo;s cheek is pressed to the side and when Tony&rsquo;s hand slips under him to tug at his belt, Peter whispers, &ldquo;Yea daddy, ruin me,&rdquo; and <i>fuck</i>, Tony loses it. Growling, he bends down and bites the back of Peter&rsquo;s neck, hand shoving into his jeans and briefs to close around the kids cock, a low groan rumbling out of his chest at the feel of his hot, wet skin. </p><p>Peter whines and arches his hips, <i>daddy</i> falling from his wet, shiny lips. Tony leaves another mark on his shoulder as he starts stroking him, heat surging in his veins as Peter writhes and moans, ass pressing back into Tony&rsquo;s groin. </p><p>He wants to see Peter&rsquo;s face, needs it, so he pulls back and turns the kid, shoving him back so his shoulders hit the metal with a dull clang, surging down to kiss him before he&rsquo;s fully able to protest the loss of Tony&rsquo;s hand on his cock. Peter mewls into the kiss, desperate and loud as Tony licks into his mouth, just as desperate as the kid.</p><p>His hands fumble with Peter&rsquo;s belt and jeans for a moment before he&rsquo;s got them pulled down his thighs, freeing his cock so he finally gets a look at it. Groaning, he wraps his hand around it and strokes slowly as he pulls on Peter&rsquo;s hair, tugging his head back so he can mark up his throat too. </p><p>&ldquo;Look at you sweetheart, all wet and moaning for daddy,&rdquo; he pants, &ldquo;you daddy&rsquo;s desperate little slut?&rdquo; he demands, grinning against Peter&rsquo;s throat when he moans and nods, hips rolling up so his cock slides through Tony&rsquo;s hand. </p><p>He digs in with avaricious pleasure, mouth sliding down to leave deep red marks on the creamy skin of Peter&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Gonna mark you up baby, let everyone know who you belong to,&rdquo; he rasps, heat curling through his belly when Peter nods and arches, pleading in soft breathy gasps. </p><p>Stroking Peter&rsquo;s cock a little faster, he focuses his attention on those pretty little nipples, sucking and biting until they&rsquo;re red, swollen and so sensitive that Peter sobs at the slightest touch. He pulls back a moment just to admire the sight beneath him; hair in disarray, lips bitten and wet, marks all over his skin, cock leaking hard in his grasp&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Christ kid, I aughta take a picture, you&rsquo;re a goddamn work of art,&rdquo; he groans, brows rising when Peter nods and moans, hips arching into his hand. </p><p>&ldquo;Please? Please,&rdquo; Peter begs brokenly and Tony&rsquo;s mouth goes dry; hand fumbling into his back pocket he pulls out his phone and opens the camera, snaps a few pictures and then pauses, switches it to the video function with a low burning of guilt and shame in the back of his throat.</p><p>Holding the phone in one hand and Peter&rsquo;s cock in the other, he strokes him, wrist twisting and thumb digging into the red, throbbing head hard enough to have Peter arching up off the rusted metal beneath him, more cum pulsing out as his thighs quiver.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna&hellip;please!&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans softly and nods, jerking him faster, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon baby, come for daddy, let me hear you,&rdquo; he demands throatily, his own cock hard behind his zipper. He focuses his attention on the head of Peter&rsquo;s cock and is rewarded when the boy cries out, high and sharp before breaking into breathless gasps as he comes, thighs shaking and head thrown back in ecstasy. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck baby, look at you, you&rsquo;re so goddamn pretty,&rdquo; Tony whispered, stroking Peter till he was shaking and whimpering, looking up through tear stained eyes and begging for him to stop. His hand is coated in cum as he hurriedly undoes his jeans and pulls out his cock, stepping closer so he&rsquo;s between Peter&rsquo;s spread thighs as he strokes his own cock. </p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a mess baby,&rdquo; Tony whispers hoarsely, hips jolting as he strokes his cock faster. Peter watches him through hooded eyes, sweat and cum on his chest, a hungry look in his eyes as he follows the motion of Tony&rsquo;s hand over his cock. </p><p>&ldquo;You like that? Seeing what you do to daddy?&rdquo; </p><p>Peter nods and leans up a little, &ldquo;Yea daddy, I like it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony groans, wrist twisting as heat builds in his gut&mdash;he&rsquo;s so close. &ldquo;Can I&mdash;shit&hellip;can I come on you baby?&rdquo; he asks, needing desperately to see his pretty boy all covered in his cum. </p><p>Peter nods and leans back on his elbows, grinning when Tony moans and steps even closer. The wet sound of his hand on his cock is loud in the small confines of the garage and he thinks distantly that it&rsquo;s a good thing the neighbors aren&rsquo;t too close or they&rsquo;d be getting an earful. </p><p>&ldquo;Come on daddy, cum on me,&rdquo; Peter whispers, staring up at him with big wide eyes and that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s all it takes for Tony to start coming. Ropes of cum land on Peter&rsquo;s chest before the kid sits up suddenly and opens his mouth, the sight so dirty and depraved it rips a groan from Tony&rsquo;s chest. </p><p>He jerks himself harder, cursing as his cum splashes into Peter&rsquo;s mouth, down over his petal pink lips and over his chin. </p><p>&ldquo;Fuck baby, oh god, oh you look so good,&rdquo; he groans, head falling back as Peter suddenly surges forward to close his lips around the head of Tony&rsquo;s cock. Slim fingers join his in stroking his cock and the wet heat of his mouth has him coming undone again, loud groans echoing off the cinder block walls. </p><p>When he&rsquo;s shuddering from sensitivity he gently pushes Peter away, smiling down at him as he swipes his thumb under his lip and pushes it into his mouth so Peter can suck his cum off it. Peter hums and looks up at him, doe eyed and fucked out and he shivers, knowing that this is a mistake he can&rsquo;t take back, and one he&rsquo;s already thinking of repeating.</p><p>&ldquo;You taste good Tony,&rdquo; the boy whispers, leaning back on his elbows as Tony ends the video recording and slides his phone and then cock away. </p><p>The sound of an engine rumbling drags his attention away from Peter and out the garage window to where Harley is parking his car in the driveway. Pure panic sluices thorough him&mdash;&ldquo;Harley&rsquo;s back, we gotta clean you up,&rdquo; he tells Peter frantically. </p><p>They stumble and knock into each other as Tony grabs a greasy rag and wipes it over Peter&rsquo;s chest, shoving his bloody shirt at him, &ldquo;Put it on!&rdquo; he hisses, panic rising when the engine outside shuts off. They have mere moments before Harley walks in and they&rsquo;re not going to make it, and oh god, what&rsquo;s he done? </p><p>He glances at Peter who still looks fucked out despite the grease and blood on his shirt, and shit, he shouldn&rsquo;t enjoy it as much as he does, but he guesses that now he knows&mdash;he&rsquo;s deeply fucked up.</p><p>The door crashes open just as he and Peter bend back over the engine of the car, talking too fast, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because then Harley is plopping on the stool and regailing them with the story of his date. It takes a few minute before he realizes Peter&rsquo;s shirt is stained with blood and then they&rsquo;re going into the house for a change of clothes and he&rsquo;s alone, suddenly, and the reality of the last hour crashes down on him. </p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>He manages to avoid being alone with Peter for three days before they wind up in the kitchen together at 2am. Peter is sitting on the island, fingers wrapped around a mug of cocoa when he walks in, pausing for a moment before shuffling over to make himself a drink. </p><p>&ldquo;Does it help?&rdquo;</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, frowning, &ldquo;Does what help?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The alcohol. Does it help you forget what we did?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony stills, heart clenching painfully in his chest. He drops his head and exhales slowly before putting aside the whiskey and reaching for a mug&mdash;cocoa is sounding better by the minute. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to forget,&rdquo; he murmurs, popping the k-cup into the Keurig and setting it to run before he turns around. Peter is eyeing him skeptically, the hurt in the back of his gaze making Tony&rsquo;s brow furrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I hurt you,&rdquo; he murmurs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off and runs a hand through his hair, &ldquo;thinking. A lot.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter makes a noncommittal sound and sips his cocoa, &ldquo;Did you enjoy it?&rdquo; he asks softly, hopefully. </p><p>&ldquo;Christ, Pete, yea I enjoyed it,&rdquo; he says with a disbelieving laugh, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s part of the issue. You&rsquo;re seventeen, a kid, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Old? Too mature? Not good enough?&rdquo; Peter supplies dryly, &ldquo;do I get an opinion at all about this?&rdquo; he asks sharply and the words cut into Tony like little barbs. &ldquo;Or are you going to decide what&rsquo;s best for me just because you&rsquo;re older?&rdquo;</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over his face, Tony shakes his head and sighs, &ldquo;Shit I&rsquo;m too tired for this,&rdquo; he mutters and then drops his hand, smiles tiredly at Peter and waves a hand, &ldquo;Go on. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter stares at him for moment and then shrugs a shoulder, &ldquo;I liked what happened, a lot. I&rsquo;ve wanted it to happen for a while, but I knew you didn&rsquo;t see me like that. I understand if you think I&rsquo;m not ready for sex or a relationship, but, well, I&rsquo;ve waited this long, I can wait until you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony&rsquo;s stomach plummets at that because shit, that&rsquo;s exactly what he doesn&rsquo;t want. He doesn&rsquo;t want to string Peter along for years while he gets comfortable with the idea of fucking a teenager, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to let him go either. He loves the kid, more than is appropriate, and he just has to figure out what the hell he&rsquo;s supposed to do now. </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to wait for me Peter, that&rsquo;s not fair to you,&rdquo; he murmurs, rubbing a hand over his face again. </p><p>&ldquo;What if&hellip;we took it slow?&rdquo; Peter offers and he glances up to find the kid watching him with a wary, hopeful expression. </p><p>Tony contemplates that while he sips his cocoa; in a year Peter would be headed off to MIT and be 18, finally on his own and ready to experience the wild world of college life. Can they make that, plus a long distance relationship work? </p><p>He scoffs at himself, because really, he already knows he&rsquo;s going to try, because it&rsquo;s <i>Peter</i>. </p><p>Setting aside his mug he stands up from where he&rsquo;s been leaning on the counter and crosses the short distance between them, hands landing gently on Peter&rsquo;s knees. He watches as the boy goes wide eyed and then slowly pushes his knees apart, hands sliding up his thighs to his hips.</p><p>Peter gasps softly, lips pink and inviting, and Tony leans up till his lips are very neatly pressed against them. </p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you want baby,&rdquo; Tony murmurs, watching as Peter shudders, eyes drooping with lust. Lithe arms wind around his shoulders and his hands at Peter&rsquo;s waist drag him closer&mdash;hip to hip so he can feel the erection the kid is already sporting. </p><p>&ldquo;Promise?&rdquo;</p><p>Tony nods and kisses him softly, &ldquo;Promise.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter melts into his kiss, sighing happily as Tony presses against him, hands demanding and firm on his body. They abandon cocoa for Tony&rsquo;s bed, and despite the urge for more, Tony takes his time in kissing Peter, running his hands over his body till he&rsquo;s as familiar with it as he is his own. </p><p>Peter falls asleep after Tony wrings his body dry with his hands and mouth, body lax in that way that can only come from hard physical labor or extremely satisfying orgasms. Tony watches him sleep, fingers running through his hair slowly, a faint smile on his lips. </p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a mistake, maybe it&rsquo;ll end badly, or maybe&hellip;</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be the best thing he&rsquo;s ever done.&nbsp;</p><p>~~~~~~~</p><p>ayyyyyeeeee, it&rsquo;s daddy tony!!

                "content_abstract": "<p>\n<p>Tony peers through the curtains above the kitchen sink, smirking as Harley and Peter cannonball into the pool, laughing and splashing happily. They&rsquo;ve been inseparable since Peter and his aunt had moved in next door three years ago. Peter was just on the edge of 14, weeks from his birthday and upon meeting Harley had found a friend for life.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s three weeks to Peter&rsquo;s 17th birthday and Tony and May have been planning his party for months. The vintage VW Bug he&rsquo;s purchased for Peter would be an extravagant gift if it wasn&rsquo;t a rusted out junker that would need a full year of work to get it operational.</p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ba23a9f8c45d69806ef82c8c36ca893/tumblr_inline_po86eoMotc1svcrbn_540.png\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>He had told May of his plans to have he and Peter work on the vehicle together so the kid would learn practical skills in mechanical engineering, a topic he knew fascinated Peter. He&rsquo;d assured her he&rsquo;d cover the cost of parts, and so long as Peter kept his grades up, he&rsquo;d get the keys to the vehicle the day he turned 18.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d done the same thing for Harley and the two years of hard work had paid off&mdash;the shiny cherry red 76 Camaro was parked in the driveway and had earned Harley a full ride to the local technical college and the offer of a job from a local garage. </p>\n<p>He hopes that Peter will have as much fun working on the car with him; the kid is naturally curious and staggeringly smart, so Tony&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;ll pick up quickly on the skills needed to repair the vehicle that&rsquo;s now waiting in the garage, covered by a tarp, just waiting to be revealed on his birthday. </p>\n<p>The screeching of the screen door draws his attention to where Peter is careening around the corner, eyes going wide as his wet feet slip on the tile. He watches in slow motion as Peter falls forward, right for the sharp corner of the granite countertop. </p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s moving before he realizes it, grabbing Peter&rsquo;s arms and hauling him up, mere breaths before he slams into the unforgiving stone. His heart beats too fast as he holds onto the kid for just a beat longer than normal, one hand plastered to the wet skin of his back. </p>\n<p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; he breathes, pulling back to run an assessing gaze over Peter, free hand tangling in those soft brown curls. &ldquo;You gotta slow down kid, I don&rsquo;t want to have to take you to the hospital again. Your Aunt almost murdered me last time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peter flushes and nods, glancing away as he bites his lip, &ldquo;Sorry Tony,&rdquo; he murmurs, looking up through his lashes at Tony. He worries at his lower lip with his teeth and Tony watches as it turns a rosy shade of pink at the attention, wet and shiny and something curls warm and wanting through his gut. </p>\n<p>Clearing his throat he steps back and pats the kid&rsquo;s shoulder awkwardly, &ldquo;Great, uh, dinner in thirty,&rdquo; he mutters before turning away and attempting to focus his attention on the chicken kebabs he had been working on. </p>\n<p>He listens to Peter rustling through the fridge for a snack before he disappears back out to the pool, laughing loudly at something Harley says too softly for him to hear. Glancing out the window, he watches as Peter throws his head back, eyes shut as he laughs, stepping back and then swaying as he loses his balance on the edge of the pool and promptly falls in with a shriek. </p>\n<p>Tony can&rsquo;t help the laugh that bursts out, affection warm in his chest. He continues skewering chicken and vegetables, the earlier moment with Peter pushed far from his mind. </p>\n<p>The further from his mind, the better.&nbsp;</p>\n</p>",
