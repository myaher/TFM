        "body": "<p><i>A/N: What the fuck am I even doing???</i></p><p>\n\nYou gaze out of the window of your bed chambers, watching the snow fall. It is winter, for the High North to Dorne. Not at all the season for your wedding. And yet here you stand in the most gorgeous dress in all the seven kingdoms. Because the King wants you to be his wife before the True War begins. And thus the maids prep you for a cold winter wedding. They make sure your hair falls down in loose ringlets. And they deck you out in jewelry of white and red gold. They hang a white clock with your father\u2019s red griffin over your shoulders. \u201cMy Lady looks beautiful.\u201d One of the maids says. You heave a sigh and rip your eyes from the window. \u201cThank you Bella.\u201d You say softly. \u201cNow come my lady. The King is waiting.\u201d The other maid urges you out of the door.\u00a0</p><!-- more --><p>A litter bring you to the enormous sept of Balor. When you step out, the air is warm, much to your surprise. You look up and find the three Dragon\u2019s chained up by the sept. Rheagal is decked out in royal armour, but Drogon and Viserion are not. Their bodies warm the air around the sept. Your father approaches. His red hair is turning white, but his green eyes still search your soul. You take his hands. His bad hand, with two fingers missing. But better a bad hand than greyscale. \u201cI love you father.\u201d You say. \u201cI love you too.\u201d He replies.<b><br/></b></p><p>Your father leads you into the sept. It is packed. The whole court and half the realms nobility is present for the royal wedding. You squeeze your father\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d He says softly. \u201cI hope you are are right.\u201d You mumble. \u201cThe old gods and the new know I am.\u201d Your father replies. He leads you to the altar.<br/>The King looks nothing like the Valyrian\u2019s that came before him. He is dark and rather sullen looking. He looks all parts a Stark, like his mother. He smiles at you and still looks like someone kicked his favorite pup. Not that said pup would get kicked. The albino direwolf lays at the King\u2019s feet. The beast is huge and his red eyes peer at you, knowingly. It scares you a little. \u201cBe unafraid.\u201d Your father whispers. He steps away from you. You feel as if you are standing on the edge of an abyss. An abyss found in the King\u2019s eyes as well as in those red, haunting eyes of his direwolf. </p><p>The King extends a hand to you. You take it, but your hand quivers a little in his. His expression is apologetic. You avoid his eyes, looking at your the edge of your dress. You feel that the king\u2019s palm begins to sweat.</p><p>The High Septon calls for silence. \u201cEveryone, everyone, please quiet yourselves.\u201d He calls, his voice carrying loudly. \u201cToday, my lords and ladies, you have gathered to see the King wed.\u201d He sounds rather self important. \u201cToday, the Father, Mother, Maiden, Smith, Warrior, Crone and Stranger smile down upon the King and our new Queen.\u201d He announces. You fluster a little upon hearing someone call you queen. The crowd cheers and claps. You peer at the King from the side of your eyes. His pale cheeks are pink as raspberries. There is something very insecure in his grey eyes.</p><p>The High Septon drones on and on. You barely pay attention to him. You look alternately at your father and the King. Your father smiles encouragingly at you. The King seems just as nervous as you feel. That warms you a little to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you will now take each other\u2019s hands.\u201d The High Septon says. There is distaste on his face. Something smug creeps into the muscles of the King\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d You mutter under your breath. \u201cI do not think he appreciates my request for the old vows.\u201d The King says smugly. You can\u2019t help a little laugh. \u201cNow repeat after me&hellip;\u201d The High Septon says, but he doesn\u2019t have to demonstrate. Your father has informed you of the practises of the North, where the King grew up. \u201cI am his and he is mine.\u201d You say. \u201cI am hers and she is mine.\u201d Jon says simultaneously. </p><p>\u201cYou may now bring the bride under your protection.\u201d The High Septon says, looking less disdained. Oberyn Martell, Hand of the King hands the King a large, heavy looking cloak. It is black and white. A black background and the white three headed dragon that is the King\u2019s personal sigil. The cloak is indeed heavy as it is wrapped around your shoulders, covering the red griffins. \u201cI declare you now Husband and Wife. Your Grace, you may kiss the bride.\u201d The High Septon announces. The King puts his fingers under your chin, making you look him into his steely grey eyes. For moment your heart stand still. From up close there is a lavender gleam in his eyes, but only when the right light shines upon his face. Which it does. For a split second you are utterly in love with him. But then his lips are cold on yours. He is more Stark than Targaryen. You fear him a little.</p><p>There is a big feast in the red keep. Festivities are huge, but the King seems dismayed. He complains rather loudly to his Hand and your father. Money should not be spend on festivites when there is war about to be waged. Oberyn tells the King it is important to be festive to keep the spirits high. This makes the King glower until Oberyn gets up and sit down beside Tyrion Lannister. You avoid your royal husband for a good while after that. You chatter with Lady Sansa and Brienne and Margaery Tyrell. </p><p>The night grows older and you actually want to just go to bed. But that is of course not how weddings work. You sit in your ornate seat and wait it out. You even nod off a little bit, your knees pulled up to your chest under your dress. You can\u2019t hear Lady Arya teasing her cousin about how cute his new wife looks asleep on her own wedding feast. That is where the King calls an end to the feast.</p><p>\u201cGo to your chambers and sleep. In the next few days we will be riding for the North!\u201d He calls out.</p><p>Gently the King wakes you. He has refused the commensing of bedding ceremony. Everyone has been send away. </p><p>You look around, blinking a little. \u201cMy .. my king, where is everyone?\u201d You mutter. \u201cPlease.. Call me Jon.\u201d The King mumbles in return. He seems so shy now that is it just the two of you. \u201cA-alright\u2026 Jon.\u201d You say. He offers you a hand. \u201cThe night is dark and full of terrors, but I will protect you.\u201d He says softly. You can\u2019t help but fluster. You take his hand and he helps you to your feet. He too, is flustered. </p><p>He leads you to the royal bedchambers. You have your own, of course, but tonight, you sleep with him. Tonight is the wedding night after all. Just the thought of it makes you nervous. You truly have no idea what to expect. </p><p>The King\u2019s bed is huge, made of ebon wood and laden with sheets and pillows and whatever else may keep him warm. There is a fire in the hearth and Ghost lays in front of his, seemingly asleep. \u201cIs it to your liking, my lady?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cY-yeah&hellip;\u201d You mumble in reply. Jon gently clasps you shoulders and makes you turn your back on him. He unlaces the intricate fastenings of your dress and hangs the expensive piece of clothing away. You feel very exposed in only your small clothes. Jon coughs dryly and you turn back to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to .. we&hellip;\u201d He mumbles. \u201cNo, we will&hellip;\u201d You shake your head. You\u2019ve decided you will perform your wifely duties to him for as long as he is in the capitol. If the King falls in war, at least there will likely be an heir. \u201cOh \u2026 okay.\u201d Jon seems a bit surprised.<br/>He takes off his black doublet and silk white jerkin. He is broad and pale and well groomed. You find, a little to your own shock, that you desire him. But it is beyond your control. Your body is pumping hormones into your bloodstream. You feel your core warm a little. You take off your corset. Jon\u2019s eyes widen. He puts his hands on your hips and draws you close. He does not look at your breasts, but in your eyes instead. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He whispers. You oblige, although your nerves are rapid firing. <br/>You can\u2019t help but freeze a little as Jon kisses you. Yet you melt soon enough. Shyly you return the kiss. Jon is warmer this time. More dragon, less direwolf. It is more pleasant this time. He holds you gently and his lips are smooth under yours. He starts backing you off to the bed. You break the kiss, startled. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d There is insecurity in Jon\u2019s voice. \u201cN-no.\u201d You mutter, stumbling back, sitting down hard on the bed. Rather unintentionally you put yourself at an height with Jon\u2019s crotch. Jon looks down on you, lavender shining in his eyes again. You gaze up at him, trying your best not to seem all too meek. You can\u2019t help but notice the bulge in his breeches. </p><p>Jon sit down beside you. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks gently. You nod, although not wholeheartedly. It seems rather futile to you to tell your husband you feel insecure. He already knows. But he too knows your determination to prefer your duty to him. \u201cJust tell me when I\u2026.\u201d He begins. You put a finger on his lips. \u201cNo, I must do this. You know that as well as I.\u201d You tell him. There is a mild nod from him. <br/>He scoots closer to you. He gently pulls you in his lap. You straddle him, like Margaery Tyrell advised you. Jon gives you a look of surprise. He seems pleased, which gives you some confidence. You take his face with both hands, smushing it a little. The result of it makes you giggle, Jon just looks so silly. He laughs in response and you relax your grip, his face taking back a more normal expression. For a moment you laugh together. Then you lean down to kiss him. Happily Jon kisses back. </p><p>You are beginning to warm to the king. To your husband. And he warms under your touch.</p><p>His hands explore your back as you exchange kisses you. You moan softly and Jon seems to growl playfully in response. You begin to desire him in earnest, even though you are still rather shy towards the hardness of his cock, which is pressed against you small clothes and throbs through the leather of Jon\u2019s breeches. You know his desire is fierce and undeniable. It is in the way he kisses you and in the way he holds you. And you let him, not uncomfortable with it. </p><p>Jon\u2019s lips wander to your jaw. You moan softly. Jon nips at your skin. You gasp. \u201cAh Jon.\u201d You press yourself against him. The heat between your thighs rises. Jon can feel it to. His hands slide down your back and tug at your small clothes. One hand slips in and cups one buttock. There is a pleased murr from Jon\u2019s lips. You lean in to kiss him again. Eagerly Jon welcomes yours with his own. This is how your wedding should have been. It is perfect and full of desire. You moan and he moans back at you. You slowly press your body against his. Lustily, Jon gropes at your ass. You moan a little and grind against him. Jon breaks the kiss to groan. He wraps his arms around you and flips you over, onto the bed. You gasp in surprise, but without aversion.<br/>Jon nests himself between your thighs. But not after taking off his breeches. His cock is outlined in his small clothes. You feel the heat of him through your own small clothes. You draw him down into a kiss. You slide your hands down his strong back and shyly touch his ass. Your Royal Husband has a very nice ass. You give it a light squeeze. Jon chuckles darkly. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d He teases. You fluster a little. \u201cY-yeah&hellip;\u201d You mumbles. Jon chuckles and noses at your throat. His lips wander down and lower. He leaves a few hickies on your neck and throat. You can\u2019t help but moan out for him. Still his lips wander lower, until he finds your nipples. You cry out his name as he suckles one nipple into his mouth. Lavishly he sucks on the hardening little bud, only to switch to the other. Playfully he bites. You gasp, pleasure searching through your spine. \u201cAh more, please.\u201d You encourage him. Jon uses his teeth again. You arch your back in the pleasure it brings you. <br/>Lower and lower his mouth trails. You grow feverishly hot. Jon drags down your small clothes with his teeth. You press your thighs together to hide your core, still a bit shy. But Jon gently presses your legs apart. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d He purrs. You have no time to react. His mouth presses against your folds. You are a little confused, but overwhelmed with pleasure. Jon\u2019s mouth feels so good. His tongue flicks out and parts your folds. He runs his tongue against the pearl in the top of your folds. You arch your back and cry out for him. Your mind is spinning, the pleasure greater than you dared imagine. You never felt anything like this before.Your hands claw at the sheets. Jon softly laps at your core. His pace is slow and steady. Ever so gently he is pushing you to that secret point of peaking. He is patient in doing so. He keeps at it until he feels all your muscles tense. Then he suckles down on the pearl. Your mind whites out, pleasure washing your consciousness away. All your muscles tightens and then release. The waves of your climax lap at your entire being. You moan and call out for Jon. Call out for more. </p><p>Jon takes off his own small clothes. You can\u2019t keep your eyes off of him, a bit to your shame. Jon is well shaped and throbbing visibly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d He asks. You can only nod. He comes back to your thighs. First he kisses you. Then he presses one finger into your wet core. And a second. You arch your back, your pleasure rising, despite the slight pain. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks. You nod a little. Jon retracts his fingers.<br/>He lines his cock up with your core. You tense up a little. Jon pushes in. Your natural barrier is barely giving him trouble. It is common in women with proclivity for horse riding, Jon isn\u2019t bothered in the least. It hurts a little bit, but the pleasure is overwhelming you. Jon is gentle and inches in slowly. You put your arms around him and pull him in for a kiss.<br/>Slowly Jon\u2019s pelvis starts rocking. Pain and pleasure mingles in your belly. You love it. You need more. \u201cJ-Jon\u2026 please.. Harder.\u201d You whimper. Your husband, of course, complies. He starts to fuck you in earnest. His flesh slaps noisily against your. You moan in unison. \u201cThis is so good.\u201d You murmur. \u201cYes, yes it is.\u201d Jon whispers in agreement.<br/>He fucks you. There is no other word for it. He is consummating the marriage for all it is worth. \u201cI\u2019ll will surely give you a son now.\u201d You whisper to him. That makes him chuckle. He kisses you slowly. He thrusts slower, so you can keep kissing without your teeth clattering together. You trail your fingers down your back, teasingly pinching his ass. Jon sniggers and nips at your lower lip. You moan loudly. \u201cGive it to me, my king.\u201d You purr. Jon hesitates not a moment. He pounds into you with reckless abandon. You tighten around his cock. \u201cTogether.\u201d You whisper. Jon can only nod. His climax is already taking him over. You tighten more and then untense, letting everything go. As does Jon. He spends himself inside you.</p><p>You watch the snow fall on the courtyards of Maegor\u2019s holdfast. Standing by one of the windows of your personal chambers in the maiden\u2019s vault. \u201cHow are you, my queen?\u201d You look up to find Tyrion Lannister waddling towards you. You place hand over your slightly swollen belly. \u201cI am scared.\u201d You say. \u201cJon could be dead\u2026 The war could be lost and we might soon all be dead.\u201d You gaze at the dark horizon. \u201cThey have dragon\u2019s, my queen, that must count for something.\u201d Tyrion says.</p>",

You look up and find the three Dragon\u2019s chained up by the sept. Rheagal is decked out in royal armour, but Drogon and Viserion are not. Their bodies warm the air around the sept. Your father approaches. His red hair is turning white, but his green eyes still search your soul. You take his hands. His bad hand, with two fingers missing. But better a bad hand than greyscale. \u201cI love you father.\u201d You say. \u201cI love you too.\u201d He replies.<b><br></b></p><p>Your father leads you into the sept. It is packed. The whole court and half the realms nobility is present for the royal wedding. You squeeze your father\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d He says softly. \u201cI hope you are are right.\u201d You mumble. \u201cThe old gods and the new know I am.\u201d Your father replies. He leads you to the altar.<br>The King looks nothing like the Valyrian\u2019s that came before him. He is dark and rather sullen looking. He looks all parts a Stark, like his mother. He smiles at you and still looks like someone kicked his favorite pup. Not that said pup would get kicked. The albino direwolf lays at the King\u2019s feet. The beast is huge and his red eyes peer at you, knowingly. It scares you a little. \u201cBe unafraid.\u201d Your father whispers. He steps away from you. You feel as if you are standing on the edge of an abyss. An abyss found in the King\u2019s eyes as well as in those red, haunting eyes of his direwolf. </p><p>The King extends a hand to you. You take it, but your hand quivers a little in his. His expression is apologetic. You avoid his eyes, looking at your the edge of your dress. You feel that the king\u2019s palm begins to sweat.</p><p>The High Septon calls for silence. \u201cEveryone, everyone, please quiet yourselves.\u201d He calls, his voice carrying loudly. \u201cToday, my lords and ladies, you have gathered to see the King wed.\u201d He sounds rather self important. \u201cToday, the Father, Mother, Maiden, Smith, Warrior, Crone and Stranger smile down upon the King and our new Queen.\u201d He announces. You fluster a little upon hearing someone call you queen. The crowd cheers and claps. You peer at the King from the side of your eyes. His pale cheeks are pink as raspberries. There is something very insecure in his grey eyes.</p><p>The High Septon drones on and on. You barely pay attention to him. You look alternately at your father and the King. Your father smiles encouragingly at you. The King seems just as nervous as you feel. That warms you a little to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you will now take each other\u2019s hands.\u201d The High Septon says. There is distaste on his face. Something smug creeps into the muscles of the King\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d You mutter under your breath. \u201cI do not think he appreciates my request for the old vows.\u201d The King says smugly. You can\u2019t help a little laugh. \u201cNow repeat after me\u2026\u201d The High Septon says, but he doesn\u2019t have to demonstrate. Your father has informed you of the practises of the North, where the King grew up. \u201cI am his and he is mine.\u201d You say. \u201cI am hers and she is mine.\u201d Jon says simultaneously. </p><p>\u201cYou may now bring the bride under your protection.\u201d The High Septon says, looking less disdained. Oberyn Martell, Hand of the King hands the King a large, heavy looking cloak. It is black and white. A black background and the white three headed dragon that is the King\u2019s personal sigil. The cloak is indeed heavy as it is wrapped around your shoulders, covering the red griffins. \u201cI declare you now Husband and Wife. Your Grace, you may kiss the bride.\u201d The High Septon announces. The King puts his fingers under your chin, making you look him into his steely grey eyes. For moment your heart stand still. From up close there is a lavender gleam in his eyes, but only when the right light shines upon his face. Which it does. For a split second you are utterly in love with him. But then his lips are cold on yours. He is more Stark than Targaryen. You fear him a little.</p><p>There is a big feast in the red keep. Festivities are huge, but the King seems dismayed. He complains rather loudly to his Hand and your father. Money should not be spend on festivites when there is war about to be waged. Oberyn tells the King it is important to be festive to keep the spirits high. This makes the King glower until Oberyn gets up and sit down beside Tyrion Lannister. You avoid your royal husband for a good while after that. You chatter with Lady Sansa and Brienne and Margaery Tyrell. </p><p>The night grows older and you actually want to just go to bed. But that is of course not how weddings work. You sit in your ornate seat and wait it out. You even nod off a little bit, your knees pulled up to your chest under your dress. You can\u2019t hear Lady Arya teasing her cousin about how cute his new wife looks asleep on her own wedding feast. That is where the King calls an end to the feast.</p><p>\u201cGo to your chambers and sleep. In the next few days we will be riding for the North!\u201d He calls out.</p><p>Gently the King wakes you. He has refused the commensing of bedding ceremony. Everyone has been send away. </p><p>You look around, blinking a little. \u201cMy .. my king, where is everyone?\u201d You mutter. \u201cPlease.. Call me Jon.\u201d The King mumbles in return. He seems so shy now that is it just the two of you. \u201cA-alright\u2026 Jon.\u201d You say. He offers you a hand. \u201cThe night is dark and full of terrors, but I will protect you.\u201d He says softly. You can\u2019t help but fluster. You take his hand and he helps you to your feet. He too, is flustered. </p><p>He leads you to the royal bedchambers. You have your own, of course, but tonight, you sleep with him. Tonight is the wedding night after all. Just the thought of it makes you nervous. You truly have no idea what to expect. </p><p>The King\u2019s bed is huge, made of ebon wood and laden with sheets and pillows and whatever else may keep him warm. There is a fire in the hearth and Ghost lays in front of his, seemingly asleep. \u201cIs it to your liking, my lady?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d You mumble in reply. Jon gently clasps you shoulders and makes you turn your back on him. He unlaces the intricate fastenings of your dress and hangs the expensive piece of clothing away. You feel very exposed in only your small clothes. Jon coughs dryly and you turn back to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to .. we\u2026\u201d He mumbles. \u201cNo, we will\u2026\u201d You shake your head. You\u2019ve decided you will perform your wifely duties to him for as long as he is in the capitol. If the King falls in war, at least there will likely be an heir. \u201cOh \u2026 okay.\u201d Jon seems a bit surprised.<br>He takes off his black doublet and silk white jerkin. He is broad and pale and well groomed. You find, a little to your own shock, that you desire him. But it is beyond your control. Your body is pumping hormones into your bloodstream. You feel your core warm a little. You take off your corset. Jon\u2019s eyes widen. He puts his hands on your hips and draws you close. He does not look at your breasts, but in your eyes instead. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He whispers. You oblige, although your nerves are rapid firing. <br>You can\u2019t help but freeze a little as Jon kisses you. Yet you melt soon enough. Shyly you return the kiss. Jon is warmer this time. More dragon, less direwolf. It is more pleasant this time. He holds you gently and his lips are smooth under yours. He starts backing you off to the bed. You break the kiss, startled. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d There is insecurity in Jon\u2019s voice. \u201cN-no.\u201d You mutter, stumbling back, sitting down hard on the bed. Rather unintentionally you put yourself at an height with Jon\u2019s crotch. Jon looks down on you, lavender shining in his eyes again. You gaze up at him, trying your best not to seem all too meek. You can\u2019t help but notice the bulge in his breeches. </p><p>Jon sit down beside you. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks gently. You nod, although not wholeheartedly. It seems rather futile to you to tell your husband you feel insecure. He already knows. But he too knows your determination to prefer your duty to him. \u201cJust tell me when I\u2026.\u201d He begins. You put a finger on his lips. \u201cNo, I must do this. You know that as well as I.\u201d You tell him. There is a mild nod from him. <br>He scoots closer to you. He gently pulls you in his lap. You straddle him, like Margaery Tyrell advised you. Jon gives you a look of surprise. He seems pleased, which gives you some confidence. You take his face with both hands, smushing it a little. The result of it makes you giggle, Jon just looks so silly. He laughs in response and you relax your grip, his face taking back a more normal expression. For a moment you laugh together. Then you lean down to kiss him. Happily Jon kisses back. </p><p>You are beginning to warm to the king. To your husband. And he warms under your touch.</p><p>His hands explore your back as you exchange kisses you. You moan softly and Jon seems to growl playfully in response. You begin to desire him in earnest, even though you are still rather shy towards the hardness of his cock, which is pressed against you small clothes and throbs through the leather of Jon\u2019s breeches. You know his desire is fierce and undeniable. It is in the way he kisses you and in the way he holds you. And you let him, not uncomfortable with it. </p><p>Jon\u2019s lips wander to your jaw. You moan softly. Jon nips at your skin. You gasp. \u201cAh Jon.\u201d You press yourself against him. The heat between your thighs rises. Jon can feel it to. His hands slide down your back and tug at your small clothes. One hand slips in and cups one buttock. There is a pleased murr from Jon\u2019s lips. You lean in to kiss him again. Eagerly Jon welcomes yours with his own. This is how your wedding should have been. It is perfect and full of desire. You moan and he moans back at you. You slowly press your body against his. Lustily, Jon gropes at your ass. You moan a little and grind against him. Jon breaks the kiss to groan. He wraps his arms around you and flips you over, onto the bed. You gasp in surprise, but without aversion.<br>Jon nests himself between your thighs. But not after taking off his breeches. His cock is outlined in his small clothes. You feel the heat of him through your own small clothes. You draw him down into a kiss. You slide your hands down his strong back and shyly touch his ass. Your Royal Husband has a very nice ass. You give it a light squeeze. Jon chuckles darkly. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d He teases. You fluster a little. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d You mumbles. Jon chuckles and noses at your throat. His lips wander down and lower. He leaves a few hickies on your neck and throat. You can\u2019t help but moan out for him. Still his lips wander lower, until he finds your nipples. You cry out his name as he suckles one nipple into his mouth. Lavishly he sucks on the hardening little bud, only to switch to the other. Playfully he bites. You gasp, pleasure searching through your spine. \u201cAh more, please.\u201d You encourage him. Jon uses his teeth again. You arch your back in the pleasure it brings you. <br>Lower and lower his mouth trails. You grow feverishly hot. Jon drags down your small clothes with his teeth. You press your thighs together to hide your core, still a bit shy. But Jon gently presses your legs apart. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d He purrs. You have no time to react. His mouth presses against your folds. You are a little confused, but overwhelmed with pleasure. Jon\u2019s mouth feels so good. His tongue flicks out and parts your folds. He runs his tongue against the pearl in the top of your folds. You arch your back and cry out for him. Your mind is spinning, the pleasure greater than you dared imagine. You never felt anything like this before.Your hands claw at the sheets. Jon softly laps at your core. His pace is slow and steady. Ever so gently he is pushing you to that secret point of peaking. He is patient in doing so. He keeps at it until he feels all your muscles tense. Then he suckles down on the pearl. Your mind whites out, pleasure washing your consciousness away. All your muscles tightens and then release. The waves of your climax lap at your entire being. You moan and call out for Jon. Call out for more. </p><p>Jon takes off his own small clothes. You can\u2019t keep your eyes off of him, a bit to your shame. Jon is well shaped and throbbing visibly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d He asks. You can only nod. He comes back to your thighs. First he kisses you. Then he presses one finger into your wet core. And a second. You arch your back, your pleasure rising, despite the slight pain. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks. You nod a little. Jon retracts his fingers.<br>He lines his cock up with your core. You tense up a little. Jon pushes in. Your natural barrier is barely giving him trouble. It is common in women with proclivity for horse riding, Jon isn\u2019t bothered in the least. It hurts a little bit, but the pleasure is overwhelming you. Jon is gentle and inches in slowly. You put your arms around him and pull him in for a kiss.<br>Slowly Jon\u2019s pelvis starts rocking. Pain and pleasure mingles in your belly. You love it. You need more. \u201cJ-Jon\u2026 please.. Harder.\u201d You whimper. Your husband, of course, complies. He starts to fuck you in earnest. His flesh slaps noisily against your. You moan in unison. \u201cThis is so good.\u201d You murmur. \u201cYes, yes it is.\u201d Jon whispers in agreement.<br>He fucks you. There is no other word for it. He is consummating the marriage for all it is worth. \u201cI\u2019ll will surely give you a son now.\u201d You whisper to him. That makes him chuckle. He kisses you slowly. He thrusts slower, so you can keep kissing without your teeth clattering together. You trail your fingers down your back, teasingly pinching his ass. Jon sniggers and nips at your lower lip. You moan loudly. \u201cGive it to me, my king.\u201d You purr. Jon hesitates not a moment. He pounds into you with reckless abandon. You tighten around his cock. \u201cTogether.\u201d You whisper. Jon can only nod. His climax is already taking him over. You tighten more and then untense, letting everything go. As does Jon. He spends himself inside you.</p><p>You watch the snow fall on the courtyards of Maegor\u2019s holdfast. Standing by one of the windows of your personal chambers in the maiden\u2019s vault. \u201cHow are you, my queen?\u201d You look up to find Tyrion Lannister waddling towards you. You place hand over your slightly swollen belly. \u201cI am scared.\u201d You say. \u201cJon could be dead\u2026 The war could be lost and we might soon all be dead.\u201d You gaze at the dark horizon. \u201cThey have dragon\u2019s, my queen, that must count for something.\u201d Tyrion says.</p>",

But then his lips are cold on yours. He is more Stark than Targaryen. You fear him a little.</p><p>There is a big feast in the red keep. Festivities are huge, but the King seems dismayed. He complains rather loudly to his Hand and your father. Money should not be spend on festivites when there is war about to be waged. Oberyn tells the King it is important to be festive to keep the spirits high. This makes the King glower until Oberyn gets up and sit down beside Tyrion Lannister. You avoid your royal husband for a good while after that. You chatter with Lady Sansa and Brienne and Margaery Tyrell. </p><p>The night grows older and you actually want to just go to bed. But that is of course not how weddings work. You sit in your ornate seat and wait it out. You even nod off a little bit, your knees pulled up to your chest under your dress. You can\u2019t hear Lady Arya teasing her cousin about how cute his new wife looks asleep on her own wedding feast. That is where the King calls an end to the feast.</p><p>\u201cGo to your chambers and sleep. In the next few days we will be riding for the North!\u201d He calls out.</p><p>Gently the King wakes you. He has refused the commensing of bedding ceremony. Everyone has been send away. </p><p>You look around, blinking a little. \u201cMy .. my king, where is everyone?\u201d You mutter. \u201cPlease.. Call me Jon.\u201d The King mumbles in return. He seems so shy now that is it just the two of you. \u201cA-alright\u2026 Jon.\u201d You say. He offers you a hand. \u201cThe night is dark and full of terrors, but I will protect you.\u201d He says softly. You can\u2019t help but fluster. You take his hand and he helps you to your feet. He too, is flustered. </p><p>He leads you to the royal bedchambers. You have your own, of course, but tonight, you sleep with him. Tonight is the wedding night after all. Just the thought of it makes you nervous. You truly have no idea what to expect. </p><p>The King\u2019s bed is huge, made of ebon wood and laden with sheets and pillows and whatever else may keep him warm. There is a fire in the hearth and Ghost lays in front of his, seemingly asleep. \u201cIs it to your liking, my lady?\u201d Jon asks. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d You mumble in reply. Jon gently clasps you shoulders and makes you turn your back on him. He unlaces the intricate fastenings of your dress and hangs the expensive piece of clothing away. You feel very exposed in only your small clothes. Jon coughs dryly and you turn back to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to .. we\u2026\u201d He mumbles. \u201cNo, we will\u2026\u201d You shake your head. You\u2019ve decided you will perform your wifely duties to him for as long as he is in the capitol. If the King falls in war, at least there will likely be an heir. \u201cOh \u2026 okay.\u201d Jon seems a bit surprised.<br>He takes off his black doublet and silk white jerkin. He is broad and pale and well groomed. You find, a little to your own shock, that you desire him. But it is beyond your control. Your body is pumping hormones into your bloodstream. You feel your core warm a little. You take off your corset. Jon\u2019s eyes widen. He puts his hands on your hips and draws you close. He does not look at your breasts, but in your eyes instead. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He whispers. You oblige, although your nerves are rapid firing. <br>You can\u2019t help but freeze a little as Jon kisses you. Yet you melt soon enough. Shyly you return the kiss. Jon is warmer this time. More dragon, less direwolf. It is more pleasant this time. He holds you gently and his lips are smooth under yours. He starts backing you off to the bed. You break the kiss, startled. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d There is insecurity in Jon\u2019s voice. \u201cN-no.\u201d You mutter, stumbling back, sitting down hard on the bed. Rather unintentionally you put yourself at an height with Jon\u2019s crotch. Jon looks down on you, lavender shining in his eyes again. You gaze up at him, trying your best not to seem all too meek. You can\u2019t help but notice the bulge in his breeches. </p><p>Jon sit down beside you. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks gently. You nod, although not wholeheartedly. It seems rather futile to you to tell your husband you feel insecure. He already knows. But he too knows your determination to prefer your duty to him. \u201cJust tell me when I\u2026.\u201d He begins. You put a finger on his lips. \u201cNo, I must do this. You know that as well as I.\u201d You tell him. There is a mild nod from him. <br>He scoots closer to you. He gently pulls you in his lap. You straddle him, like Margaery Tyrell advised you. Jon gives you a look of surprise. He seems pleased, which gives you some confidence. You take his face with both hands, smushing it a little. The result of it makes you giggle, Jon just looks so silly. He laughs in response and you relax your grip, his face taking back a more normal expression. For a moment you laugh together. Then you lean down to kiss him. Happily Jon kisses back. </p><p>You are beginning to warm to the king. To your husband. And he warms under your touch.</p><p>His hands explore your back as you exchange kisses you. You moan softly and Jon seems to growl playfully in response. You begin to desire him in earnest, even though you are still rather shy towards the hardness of his cock, which is pressed against you small clothes and throbs through the leather of Jon\u2019s breeches. You know his desire is fierce and undeniable. It is in the way he kisses you and in the way he holds you. And you let him, not uncomfortable with it. </p><p>Jon\u2019s lips wander to your jaw. You moan softly. Jon nips at your skin. You gasp. \u201cAh Jon.\u201d You press yourself against him. The heat between your thighs rises. Jon can feel it to. His hands slide down your back and tug at your small clothes. One hand slips in and cups one buttock. There is a pleased murr from Jon\u2019s lips. You lean in to kiss him again. Eagerly Jon welcomes yours with his own. This is how your wedding should have been. It is perfect and full of desire. You moan and he moans back at you. You slowly press your body against his. Lustily, Jon gropes at your ass. You moan a little and grind against him. Jon breaks the kiss to groan. He wraps his arms around you and flips you over, onto the bed. You gasp in surprise, but without aversion.<br>Jon nests himself between your thighs. But not after taking off his breeches. His cock is outlined in his small clothes. You feel the heat of him through your own small clothes. You draw him down into a kiss. You slide your hands down his strong back and shyly touch his ass. Your Royal Husband has a very nice ass. You give it a light squeeze. Jon chuckles darkly. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d He teases. You fluster a little. \u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d You mumbles. Jon chuckles and noses at your throat. His lips wander down and lower. He leaves a few hickies on your neck and throat. You can\u2019t help but moan out for him. Still his lips wander lower, until he finds your nipples. You cry out his name as he suckles one nipple into his mouth. Lavishly he sucks on the hardening little bud, only to switch to the other. Playfully he bites. You gasp, pleasure searching through your spine. \u201cAh more, please.\u201d You encourage him. Jon uses his teeth again. You arch your back in the pleasure it brings you. <br>Lower and lower his mouth trails. You grow feverishly hot. Jon drags down your small clothes with his teeth. You press your thighs together to hide your core, still a bit shy. But Jon gently presses your legs apart. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy.\u201d He purrs. You have no time to react. His mouth presses against your folds. You are a little confused, but overwhelmed with pleasure. Jon\u2019s mouth feels so good. His tongue flicks out and parts your folds. He runs his tongue against the pearl in the top of your folds. You arch your back and cry out for him. Your mind is spinning, the pleasure greater than you dared imagine. You never felt anything like this before.Your hands claw at the sheets. Jon softly laps at your core. His pace is slow and steady. Ever so gently he is pushing you to that secret point of peaking. He is patient in doing so. He keeps at it until he feels all your muscles tense. Then he suckles down on the pearl. Your mind whites out, pleasure washing your consciousness away. All your muscles tightens and then release. The waves of your climax lap at your entire being. You moan and call out for Jon. Call out for more. </p><p>Jon takes off his own small clothes. You can\u2019t keep your eyes off of him, a bit to your shame. Jon is well shaped and throbbing visibly. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d He asks. You can only nod. He comes back to your thighs. First he kisses you. Then he presses one finger into your wet core. And a second. You arch your back, your pleasure rising, despite the slight pain. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asks. You nod a little. Jon retracts his fingers.<br>He lines his cock up with your core. You tense up a little. Jon pushes in. Your natural barrier is barely giving him trouble. It is common in women with proclivity for horse riding, Jon isn\u2019t bothered in the least. It hurts a little bit, but the pleasure is overwhelming you. Jon is gentle and inches in slowly. You put your arms around him and pull him in for a kiss.<br>Slowly Jon\u2019s pelvis starts rocking. Pain and pleasure mingles in your belly. You love it. You need more. \u201cJ-Jon\u2026 please.. Harder.\u201d You whimper. Your husband, of course, complies. He starts to fuck you in earnest. His flesh slaps noisily against your. You moan in unison. \u201cThis is so good.\u201d You murmur. \u201cYes, yes it is.\u201d Jon whispers in agreement.<br>He fucks you. There is no other word for it. He is consummating the marriage for all it is worth. \u201cI\u2019ll will surely give you a son now.\u201d You whisper to him. That makes him chuckle. He kisses you slowly. He thrusts slower, so you can keep kissing without your teeth clattering together. You trail your fingers down your back, teasingly pinching his ass. Jon sniggers and nips at your lower lip. You moan loudly. \u201cGive it to me, my king.\u201d You purr. Jon hesitates not a moment. He pounds into you with reckless abandon. You tighten around his cock. \u201cTogether.\u201d You whisper. Jon can only nod. His climax is already taking him over. You tighten more and then untense, letting everything go. As does Jon. He spends himself inside you.</p><p>You watch the snow fall on the courtyards of Maegor\u2019s holdfast. Standing by one of the windows of your personal chambers in the maiden\u2019s vault. \u201cHow are you, my queen?\u201d You look up to find Tyrion Lannister waddling towards you. You place hand over your slightly swollen belly. \u201cI am scared.\u201d You say. \u201cJon could be dead\u2026 The war could be lost and we might soon all be dead.\u201d You gaze at the dark horizon. \u201cThey have dragon\u2019s, my queen, that must count for something.\u201d Tyrion says.</p>",
                "content": "<p><i>A/N: What the fuck am I even doing???</i></p><p>\n\nYou gaze out of the window of your bed chambers, watching the snow fall. It is winter, for the High North to Dorne. Not at all the season for your wedding. And yet here you stand in the most gorgeous dress in all the seven kingdoms. Because the King wants you to be his wife before the True War begins. And thus the maids prep you for a cold winter wedding. They make sure your hair falls down in loose ringlets. And they deck you out in jewelry of white and red gold. They hang a white clock with your father&rsquo;s red griffin over your shoulders. &ldquo;My Lady looks beautiful.&rdquo; One of the maids says. You heave a sigh and rip your eyes from the window. &ldquo;Thank you Bella.&rdquo; You say softly. &ldquo;Now come my lady. The King is waiting.&rdquo; The other maid urges you out of the door.&nbsp;</p><p>A litter bring you to the enormous sept of Balor. When you step out, the air is warm, much to your surprise. You look up and find the three Dragon&rsquo;s chained up by the sept. Rheagal is decked out in royal armour, but Drogon and Viserion are not. Their bodies warm the air around the sept. Your father approaches. His red hair is turning white, but his green eyes still search your soul. You take his hands. His bad hand, with two fingers missing. But better a bad hand than greyscale. &ldquo;I love you father.&rdquo; You say. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo; He replies.<b><br /></b></p><p>Your father leads you into the sept. It is packed. The whole court and half the realms nobility is present for the royal wedding. You squeeze your father&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do fine.&rdquo; He says softly. &ldquo;I hope you are are right.&rdquo; You mumble. &ldquo;The old gods and the new know I am.&rdquo; Your father replies. He leads you to the altar.<br />The King looks nothing like the Valyrian&rsquo;s that came before him. He is dark and rather sullen looking. He looks all parts a Stark, like his mother. He smiles at you and still looks like someone kicked his favorite pup. Not that said pup would get kicked. The albino direwolf lays at the King&rsquo;s feet. The beast is huge and his red eyes peer at you, knowingly. It scares you a little. &ldquo;Be unafraid.&rdquo; Your father whispers. He steps away from you. You feel as if you are standing on the edge of an abyss. An abyss found in the King&rsquo;s eyes as well as in those red, haunting eyes of his direwolf. </p><p>The King extends a hand to you. You take it, but your hand quivers a little in his. His expression is apologetic. You avoid his eyes, looking at your the edge of your dress. You feel that the king&rsquo;s palm begins to sweat.</p><p>The High Septon calls for silence. &ldquo;Everyone, everyone, please quiet yourselves.&rdquo; He calls, his voice carrying loudly. &ldquo;Today, my lords and ladies, you have gathered to see the King wed.&rdquo; He sounds rather self important. &ldquo;Today, the Father, Mother, Maiden, Smith, Warrior, Crone and Stranger smile down upon the King and our new Queen.&rdquo; He announces. You fluster a little upon hearing someone call you queen. The crowd cheers and claps. You peer at the King from the side of your eyes. His pale cheeks are pink as raspberries. There is something very insecure in his grey eyes.</p><p>The High Septon drones on and on. You barely pay attention to him. You look alternately at your father and the King. Your father smiles encouragingly at you. The King seems just as nervous as you feel. That warms you a little to him.</p><p>&ldquo;If you will now take each other&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; The High Septon says. There is distaste on his face. Something smug creeps into the muscles of the King&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; You mutter under your breath. &ldquo;I do not think he appreciates my request for the old vows.&rdquo; The King says smugly. You can&rsquo;t help a little laugh. &ldquo;Now repeat after me&hellip;&rdquo; The High Septon says, but he doesn&rsquo;t have to demonstrate. Your father has informed you of the practises of the North, where the King grew up. &ldquo;I am his and he is mine.&rdquo; You say. &ldquo;I am hers and she is mine.&rdquo; Jon says simultaneously. </p><p>&ldquo;You may now bring the bride under your protection.&rdquo; The High Septon says, looking less disdained. Oberyn Martell, Hand of the King hands the King a large, heavy looking cloak. It is black and white. A black background and the white three headed dragon that is the King&rsquo;s personal sigil. The cloak is indeed heavy as it is wrapped around your shoulders, covering the red griffins. &ldquo;I declare you now Husband and Wife. Your Grace, you may kiss the bride.&rdquo; The High Septon announces. The King puts his fingers under your chin, making you look him into his steely grey eyes. For moment your heart stand still. From up close there is a lavender gleam in his eyes, but only when the right light shines upon his face. Which it does. For a split second you are utterly in love with him.

It\u2019s a really big favorite of mine, especially on rereads. I teared up the last time I read him saying goodbye to Bran, standing up to Catelyn just so he could have a few minutes to say farewell to his brother.</p><blockquote><p><i>\n\n\u201cShall I call the guards?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cCall them,\u201d Jon said, defiant. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me from seeing him.\u201c\u00a0</i></p><p><i>He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay\u2026This was not the Bran he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u2026&quot;Bran,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come before. I was afraid.\u201d He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks. Jon no longer cared. \u201cDon\u2019t die, Bran. Please. We\u2019re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone \u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0</i><br/></p></blockquote><p>This moment just feels so hopeless. Jon\u2019s emotions are expressed so well, and it really endeared me to him. After the first couple of Jon POV chapters, I was immediately hooked and knew I\u2019d be a fan of his for a <i>long</i>\u00a0time.\u00a0</p><p>(While this moment makes me cry, it\u2019s nothing compared to when Jon\u2019s joy when he finds out that Bran is alive and awake, when he asks Tyrion to help his brother in any way he can. Jon\u2019s relationship with Arya, Robb, and Sansa is looked at a lot in meta and fic, but I think his relationship with Bran was equally as loving and beautiful.)</p>",

She insisted he sit down and relax, her quick warning glare reminding him of how he was supposed to act.</p><p>Taking note of the rearranged d\u00e9cor, and he wasn\u2019t entirely sure he liked it as he was now so used to the way things were, Jon sat as far away from Dany\u2019s wheelchair as he could manage. Not that it made much of a difference, for she was almost directly across him now, though facing the television. This gave him a good view of her profile, and for a long, helpless minute he studied every inch of that regal outline including how lovely her hair looked (those braids must have taken hours to get right), the silky sheen of that silver mane he would love to run his fingers through, the glint of amusement to bounce off those pretty violet eyes, the soft rosy hue of her cheeks almost matching the plump sweetness of her lips and \u2013</p><p>\u201cChips and dip?\u201d came the sudden question as a large bowl of the snack was thrust beneath his nose. He was ready to shake his head when he met Arya\u2019s light scowl.

        "body": "<p>Whilst reseaching for one of my novels, heavily influenced by Egyptain mythology, I came across a reference to the Horus Myth and I was surprised I had never noticed it before.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it has been picked up on before but i\u2019m just going to explain my thoughts anyway.</p><p>In the myth in question, Horus, known as Horus the Younger was the son of Isis and Osiris. When his father was murdered by his <i>UNCLE </i>Set<i>, </i>they fought an <b>\u00a0EPIC MYTHICAL BATTLE </b>against eachother<b>\u00a0</b>and Horus was victorious.
