Enjoy!\n\n<!-- more --></p>\n<p>CHAPTER 8: The Spider Trap</p>\n<p>Somehow, Dan had managed to survive the Lester-Birthday-Festivities and before he knew it, it was already February.</p>\n\n<p>It had been over two weeks since Dan had posted a search tweet on twitter. Shortly after that, he and Phil had gone to their nearest animal shelter and pet shop to put up notices about Sammy. They even went to the vet after one of their very clever subscribers pointed out that Sammy might have a microchip and they could easily find the owner that way \u2013 but there was no microchip to be found. It was really frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Sara also didn\u2019t have any luck in finding a new owner, but she did point out that she was extremely choosy. She had apologized at least a hundred times about that and had offered to take Ivy back any time. Of course, both Dan and Phil had refused. Dan had tried to tell himself that he didn\u2019t like to go back on his word, but if he was completely honest with himself, he kept Ivy because he liked having her around.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird how normal it had become for him to have a dog and a cat around. He had even gotten used to going out with Ivy three times a day (Phil pitched in as well), and he was actually looking forward to their walks. When he could afford to have a day off, which became more and more difficult as their tour approached, Phil would accompany Dan to go drive out to a bigger park. They would play fetch with Ivy and actually spent more than half an hour outside at a time. At those times, Dan wished that he and Phil lived on the outskirts of London so they could take Ivy somewhere nice more frequently, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind where they were going as long as she got to play outside.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank back in his office chair and sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. Ivy was snoozing by his feet, while Sammy had decided to take up residency on Phil\u2019s lap. Phil was sitting on the chair next to Dan, his laptop in front of him. He ignored it while he searched for something on his phone. Or maybe he was just scrolling through tumblr. Dan couldn\u2019t quite understand why Phil didn\u2019t just use his laptop to do whatever he was doing, but then again, it was Phil. He rarely made sense.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at the fluffy ball lying at his feet. Ivy was completely dead to the world, her ears twitching from time to time. She was so peaceful, and Dan had gotten so used to her presence that he honestly couldn\u2019t imagine her leaving. He thought about this more and more these days because just a few days ago Sara had texted him that she might have found someone who fit the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil from the corner of his eyes. Phil didn\u2019t know about this. Dan wasn\u2019t all too keen on telling him, either. He could tell that Phil was already way too hung up on Sammy, and Ivy had a special place in his heart, too.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks, Phil had dropped some very obvious hints about keeping Ivy. Dan wasn\u2019t against having a dog per se, but there were just so many things to keep in mind. The city. The tour. Their lives. Who knew when one of them would meet someone and move out, and then who would keep Ivy?</p>\n\n<p>To Dan, all of these things just sounded like lazy excuses. They could actually work around most difficulties with Ivy there. Even the possibility of them separating could be figured out (but Dan guessed that this wouldn\u2019t happen all too soon for several reasons). He couldn\u2019t really put his finger on why he was unable to say yes to all of this. Maybe it was because Sara had finally found someone, and Dan didn\u2019t want to take away the dog from them? Was it because he was scared?</p>\n\n<p>Dan gave another sigh and sank further into his chair, glaring at his laptop as if it was at fault for not writing the script for his latest video.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Phil asked and regarded Dan with a curious glance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said and sat up straight again. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do about this script.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe come back to it later? Have a break?\u201d Phil suggested. He looked back at his phone and absentmindedly patted Sammy\u2019s back. The cat purred and closed its eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you retweet the search tweet?\u201d Dan asked and stood up to flop down on the couch behind them. Ivy stirred, but didn\u2019t get up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust this morning,\u201d Phil said, not taking his eyes off his phone. \u201cDidn\u2019t get anything back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan pursed his lips and stared at the ceiling. Then he looked back at Phil with furrowed brows. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to write your disstrack?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am writing my disstrack. I\u2019m just taking a little break, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cU-hu,\u201d Dan said, looking back at the ceiling. For some reason, his brain felt empty. Maybe it was still the aftermath of Phil\u2019s birthday get-together the day before. It had been the third one in a row, and Dan hadn\u2019t been able to talk himself out of that one or the ones before. Maybe he should just book a holiday for next year and escape the socializing hell until it was over and celebrate Phil\u2019s birthday with him in peace afterwards. Just the two of them, that would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>As it so often did, Dan\u2019s gaze wandered and fell on Ivy\u2019s sleeping form on the floor. It really didn\u2019t matter what she did, she was always so damn adorable Dan couldn\u2019t really decided whether he wanted to turn into a puddle or scream with joy. He fished his phone out of his pocket and snapped a picture of Ivy. He sent it straight to Sara. After all, he had to keep her updated on Ivy\u2019s well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Dan let his hand fall back on the sofa. He stared back at the ceiling, as if it was able to give him the script he needed. It didn\u2019t, obviously. But it was worth a try.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe he should just get up, move around a bit and while he was at it, get a drink. Hydration was important to keep your brain working. Dan flung himself onto his feet and headed for the door.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey Phil, I\u2019m gonna get myself some water, do you \u2013\u201d Dan started but didn\u2019t finish as he let out a very high-pitched scream and scrambled back to the sofa, startling Phil, Sammy and Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA spider!\u201d Dan screamed and jumped on the sofa, waving his hands frantically in the general direction of the door. \u201cSpider!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The spider was a gigantic, hairy monster that was just casually walking through the door and into the office like it owned the place. At least that\u2019s how Dan saw it. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t be all too sure, as his phobia tended to transform and pull at his vision as soon as he spotted a spider.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had whipped his head around, spotted the spider, squeaked, dropped his phone on the desk and followed Dan onto the sofa. In the process he had dislodged a disgruntled Sammy and almost fell over in his haste to get to Dan.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake it away, take it away!\u201d Phil squeaked, gripping Dan\u2019s arm hard and attempting to hide behind Dan\u2019s back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you do it!\u201d Dan squeaked back, grabbing Phil\u2019s arm and pushing him away. He would not be a human shield between Phil and a fucking spider.</p>\n\n<p>For about two minutes Dan and Phil wrestled on the sofa, trying to push each other in front of themselves. Dan didn\u2019t let his eyes loose sight of the spider, which at some point stopped dead in its tracks, as if to consider which way to go and wreck more havoc.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStop it Phil!\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil hard, almost throwing him off the sofa. Phil squealed, his arms flailing in the air to regain his balance. When he was standing upright again, he gave Dan a dirty look. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst friend ever,\u201d Phil declared.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dan said without looking away from the spider. \u201cHow about we figure out what to do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so not going to get down from this sofa,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe neither!\u201d Dan said and finally looked up at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at Dan. \u201cYou know exactly what that means.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! We can\u2019t rock-paper-sicssors about this!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes we can! How else are we supposed to ever get down from the sofa?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan mirrored Phil\u2019s stance and hissed angrily, \u201cI am an arachnophobic, I just can\u2019t, Phil!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of spiders, too!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more afraid of spiders than you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, I am!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTwice that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan stomped his foot, which elicited an ominous cracking sound from the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair! I listed my fear of spiders in TABINOF while you talked about horses!\u201d Dan gave Phil an evil grin. \u201cHow about you pick up the spider and I promise to remove any stray horse from your sight should we encounter one?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stomped his foot, too, and the sofa cracked again. \u201cNot fair! We don\u2019t leave the house often enough to actually meet any horses!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible!\u201d Dan shouted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think you are a crap friend!\u201d Phil shouted back.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could retort something really nasty, Ivy barked. He whipped his head around to see her standing over the spider, looking from it back to Dan and Phil on the sofa. The spider was completely frozen. A bit to the side stood Sammy, regarding the spider warily.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, everyone was still. Dan held his breath. Then, Ivy extended a curious paw to poke the spider. Before her paw could even so much as touch it, the spider scrambled backwards. Ivy jumped and gave an angry bark. Phil squeaked again. Dan couldn\u2019t help but jump as well as soon as he saw the spider move. He could feel his heart rate pick up in speed, and he felt a faint nausea in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n\n<p>The spider stumbled towards the nearest wall which happened to be the one next to the desk. </p>\n\n<p><em>It definitely wants to hide,</em> Dan thought, and oh fucking hell, if it got behind the desk they would never be able to get it out there.</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s gaze fell on Sammy who had, as soon as the spider had started moving again, ducked. He was watching the spider\u2019s every move narrowly, but he didn\u2019t move so much as an inch. Ivy was still barking, and Dan was torn about what to do. Someone had to do something, but he felt like he was glued to the sofa, his knees shaking from the mere thought of getting near that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly there was a flurry of movement, and it all happened at the same time; to his left, Phil jumped down from the sofa, stalking towards the desk; Sammy leaped on top of the spider, and Ivy pounced on it, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan heard Phil gasp as he fell back a little. They both watched their pets\u2019 flailing limbs. Dan couldn\u2019t make out what happened until Ivy stepped back and gave him a good view of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was lying on the floor, his paws on the spider, which looked pretty dead to Dan from where he stood. It at least seemed a lot flatter than before. Dan could barely make out the tips of its legs poking out from under Sammy\u2019s paw.</p>\n\n<p>And then Sammy leaned forward and swallowed the spider in one gulp. Dan and Phil gasped in disgust and Dan averted his gaze. He really couldn\u2019t watch Sammy chewing on that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank down on the sofa, shaking all over. He took in a deep breath and counted each inhale and exhale to calm his racing heart. It was over, the spider was gone for good, and all would be fine. Dan knew, however, that he would obsessively check his surroundings for more spiders for the rest of the day. Working on his script at all was not going to happen today. Great.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Phil asked. Dan looked up at Phil, who regarded him anxiously. \u201cYou look a bit pale.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan said through gritted teeth. He looked away from Phil and spotted Ivy, who was walking over to him with her tail wagging.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s a good girl?\u201d Dan cooed and patted Ivy on the head. \u201cWho saved me from the big scary spider? Yes, you did!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grabbed Ivy and cradled her to his chest. She licked him once across his right cheek and allowed him to just hold her. Her soft fur and warm little body immediately calmed Dan down. He buried his nose in her fur and just breathed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, Sammy helped, too,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank him after his snack,\u201d Dan said. He closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see or hear anything right now.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, I was about to go and do something about the spider,\u201d Phil pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd you decided to do that after you tried to bully me into doing it even though you are well aware that I\u2019m terrified of spiders?\u201d Dan snarled. He looked up to give Phil his dirtiest look. Phil did have the decency to look ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd it was uncalled for to call me a crap friend,\u201d Dan mumbled and buried his face in Ivy\u2019s fur again. Ivy gave a little huff and lay her head on Dan\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I was just so scared myself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grumbled, but didn\u2019t look up. He was actually angry with Phil this time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you some tea,\u201d Phil said and rushed out of the room.</p>\n\n<p>Dan stayed on the sofa with Ivy, counting his inhales. At some point, Sammy decided to jumped up to lay down next to Dan. He sprawled out and yawned, lying down to take what Dan presumed to be a digestive nap.</p>\n\n<p>Only when Dan felt his heartbeat slow down, he leaned back and let Ivy lie across his lap. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes from scanning every corner of the room for more spiders. He continued to do that until Phil came back into the office, carrying two mugs and a packet of hobnobs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan wordlessly took the offered mug and sipped it. He refused to look at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sat next to Dan and sipped his own tea. They both said nothing for a while.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI sometimes forget how bad it is for you,\u201d Phil said eventually.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLike, actually, really, deeply, sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c&hellip;\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan you ever forgive me, Daniel?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed at Phil\u2019s overly theatrical voice. He was sure that Phil had also pulled all registers by whipping out his best puppy-dog eyes.</p>\n\n<p>And sure enough, when Dan turned to look at Phil, his friend was giving him his best wounded-puppy-look. Dan rolled his eyes at him, but couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling. \u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s fine, just stop looking at me like that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to sip on his tea, a smug smile on his face. Dan rolled his eyes again. Phil really was impossible.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you know that spiders have to pump blood into their legs to be able to move?\u201d Phil asked out of the blue.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really wanted to know that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like their having a mini-errection every time they move a leg!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEw, Phil!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil just laughed at Dan\u2019s outraged expression.

Enjoy!\n\n[[MORE]]</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 8: The Spider Trap</p>\n<p>Somehow, Dan had managed to survive the Lester-Birthday-Festivities and before he knew it, it was already February.</p>\n\n<p>It had been over two weeks since Dan had posted a search tweet on twitter. Shortly after that, he and Phil had gone to their nearest animal shelter and pet shop to put up notices about Sammy. They even went to the vet after one of their very clever subscribers pointed out that Sammy might have a microchip and they could easily find the owner that way \u2013 but there was no microchip to be found. It was really frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Sara also didn\u2019t have any luck in finding a new owner, but she did point out that she was extremely choosy. She had apologized at least a hundred times about that and had offered to take Ivy back any time. Of course, both Dan and Phil had refused. Dan had tried to tell himself that he didn\u2019t like to go back on his word, but if he was completely honest with himself, he kept Ivy because he liked having her around.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird how normal it had become for him to have a dog and a cat around. He had even gotten used to going out with Ivy three times a day (Phil pitched in as well), and he was actually looking forward to their walks. When he could afford to have a day off, which became more and more difficult as their tour approached, Phil would accompany Dan to go drive out to a bigger park. They would play fetch with Ivy and actually spent more than half an hour outside at a time. At those times, Dan wished that he and Phil lived on the outskirts of London so they could take Ivy somewhere nice more frequently, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind where they were going as long as she got to play outside.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank back in his office chair and sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. Ivy was snoozing by his feet, while Sammy had decided to take up residency on Phil\u2019s lap. Phil was sitting on the chair next to Dan, his laptop in front of him. He ignored it while he searched for something on his phone. Or maybe he was just scrolling through tumblr. Dan couldn\u2019t quite understand why Phil didn\u2019t just use his laptop to do whatever he was doing, but then again, it was Phil. He rarely made sense.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at the fluffy ball lying at his feet. Ivy was completely dead to the world, her ears twitching from time to time. She was so peaceful, and Dan had gotten so used to her presence that he honestly couldn\u2019t imagine her leaving. He thought about this more and more these days because just a few days ago Sara had texted him that she might have found someone who fit the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil from the corner of his eyes. Phil didn\u2019t know about this. Dan wasn\u2019t all too keen on telling him, either. He could tell that Phil was already way too hung up on Sammy, and Ivy had a special place in his heart, too.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks, Phil had dropped some very obvious hints about keeping Ivy. Dan wasn\u2019t against having a dog per se, but there were just so many things to keep in mind. The city. The tour. Their lives. Who knew when one of them would meet someone and move out, and then who would keep Ivy?</p>\n\n<p>To Dan, all of these things just sounded like lazy excuses. They could actually work around most difficulties with Ivy there. Even the possibility of them separating could be figured out (but Dan guessed that this wouldn\u2019t happen all too soon for several reasons). He couldn\u2019t really put his finger on why he was unable to say yes to all of this. Maybe it was because Sara had finally found someone, and Dan didn\u2019t want to take away the dog from them? Was it because he was scared?</p>\n\n<p>Dan gave another sigh and sank further into his chair, glaring at his laptop as if it was at fault for not writing the script for his latest video.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Phil asked and regarded Dan with a curious glance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said and sat up straight again. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do about this script.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe come back to it later? Have a break?\u201d Phil suggested. He looked back at his phone and absentmindedly patted Sammy\u2019s back. The cat purred and closed its eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you retweet the search tweet?\u201d Dan asked and stood up to flop down on the couch behind them. Ivy stirred, but didn\u2019t get up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust this morning,\u201d Phil said, not taking his eyes off his phone. \u201cDidn\u2019t get anything back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan pursed his lips and stared at the ceiling. Then he looked back at Phil with furrowed brows. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to write your disstrack?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am writing my disstrack. I\u2019m just taking a little break, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cU-hu,\u201d Dan said, looking back at the ceiling. For some reason, his brain felt empty. Maybe it was still the aftermath of Phil\u2019s birthday get-together the day before. It had been the third one in a row, and Dan hadn\u2019t been able to talk himself out of that one or the ones before. Maybe he should just book a holiday for next year and escape the socializing hell until it was over and celebrate Phil\u2019s birthday with him in peace afterwards. Just the two of them, that would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>As it so often did, Dan\u2019s gaze wandered and fell on Ivy\u2019s sleeping form on the floor. It really didn\u2019t matter what she did, she was always so damn adorable Dan couldn\u2019t really decided whether he wanted to turn into a puddle or scream with joy. He fished his phone out of his pocket and snapped a picture of Ivy. He sent it straight to Sara. After all, he had to keep her updated on Ivy\u2019s well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Dan let his hand fall back on the sofa. He stared back at the ceiling, as if it was able to give him the script he needed. It didn\u2019t, obviously. But it was worth a try.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe he should just get up, move around a bit and while he was at it, get a drink. Hydration was important to keep your brain working. Dan flung himself onto his feet and headed for the door.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey Phil, I\u2019m gonna get myself some water, do you \u2013\u201d Dan started but didn\u2019t finish as he let out a very high-pitched scream and scrambled back to the sofa, startling Phil, Sammy and Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA spider!\u201d Dan screamed and jumped on the sofa, waving his hands frantically in the general direction of the door. \u201cSpider!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The spider was a gigantic, hairy monster that was just casually walking through the door and into the office like it owned the place. At least that\u2019s how Dan saw it. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t be all too sure, as his phobia tended to transform and pull at his vision as soon as he spotted a spider.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had whipped his head around, spotted the spider, squeaked, dropped his phone on the desk and followed Dan onto the sofa. In the process he had dislodged a disgruntled Sammy and almost fell over in his haste to get to Dan.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake it away, take it away!\u201d Phil squeaked, gripping Dan\u2019s arm hard and attempting to hide behind Dan\u2019s back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you do it!\u201d Dan squeaked back, grabbing Phil\u2019s arm and pushing him away. He would not be a human shield between Phil and a fucking spider.</p>\n\n<p>For about two minutes Dan and Phil wrestled on the sofa, trying to push each other in front of themselves. Dan didn\u2019t let his eyes loose sight of the spider, which at some point stopped dead in its tracks, as if to consider which way to go and wreck more havoc.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStop it Phil!\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil hard, almost throwing him off the sofa. Phil squealed, his arms flailing in the air to regain his balance. When he was standing upright again, he gave Dan a dirty look. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst friend ever,\u201d Phil declared.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dan said without looking away from the spider. \u201cHow about we figure out what to do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so not going to get down from this sofa,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe neither!\u201d Dan said and finally looked up at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at Dan. \u201cYou know exactly what that means.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! We can\u2019t rock-paper-sicssors about this!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes we can! How else are we supposed to ever get down from the sofa?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan mirrored Phil\u2019s stance and hissed angrily, \u201cI am an arachnophobic, I just can\u2019t, Phil!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of spiders, too!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more afraid of spiders than you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, I am!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTwice that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan stomped his foot, which elicited an ominous cracking sound from the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair! I listed my fear of spiders in TABINOF while you talked about horses!\u201d Dan gave Phil an evil grin. \u201cHow about you pick up the spider and I promise to remove any stray horse from your sight should we encounter one?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stomped his foot, too, and the sofa cracked again. \u201cNot fair! We don\u2019t leave the house often enough to actually meet any horses!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible!\u201d Dan shouted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think you are a crap friend!\u201d Phil shouted back.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could retort something really nasty, Ivy barked. He whipped his head around to see her standing over the spider, looking from it back to Dan and Phil on the sofa. The spider was completely frozen. A bit to the side stood Sammy, regarding the spider warily.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, everyone was still. Dan held his breath. Then, Ivy extended a curious paw to poke the spider. Before her paw could even so much as touch it, the spider scrambled backwards. Ivy jumped and gave an angry bark. Phil squeaked again. Dan couldn\u2019t help but jump as well as soon as he saw the spider move. He could feel his heart rate pick up in speed, and he felt a faint nausea in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n\n<p>The spider stumbled towards the nearest wall which happened to be the one next to the desk. </p>\n\n<p><em>It definitely wants to hide,</em> Dan thought, and oh fucking hell, if it got behind the desk they would never be able to get it out there.</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s gaze fell on Sammy who had, as soon as the spider had started moving again, ducked. He was watching the spider\u2019s every move narrowly, but he didn\u2019t move so much as an inch. Ivy was still barking, and Dan was torn about what to do. Someone had to do something, but he felt like he was glued to the sofa, his knees shaking from the mere thought of getting near that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly there was a flurry of movement, and it all happened at the same time; to his left, Phil jumped down from the sofa, stalking towards the desk; Sammy leaped on top of the spider, and Ivy pounced on it, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan heard Phil gasp as he fell back a little. They both watched their pets\u2019 flailing limbs. Dan couldn\u2019t make out what happened until Ivy stepped back and gave him a good view of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was lying on the floor, his paws on the spider, which looked pretty dead to Dan from where he stood. It at least seemed a lot flatter than before. Dan could barely make out the tips of its legs poking out from under Sammy\u2019s paw.</p>\n\n<p>And then Sammy leaned forward and swallowed the spider in one gulp. Dan and Phil gasped in disgust and Dan averted his gaze. He really couldn\u2019t watch Sammy chewing on that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank down on the sofa, shaking all over. He took in a deep breath and counted each inhale and exhale to calm his racing heart. It was over, the spider was gone for good, and all would be fine. Dan knew, however, that he would obsessively check his surroundings for more spiders for the rest of the day. Working on his script at all was not going to happen today. Great.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Phil asked. Dan looked up at Phil, who regarded him anxiously. \u201cYou look a bit pale.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan said through gritted teeth. He looked away from Phil and spotted Ivy, who was walking over to him with her tail wagging.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s a good girl?\u201d Dan cooed and patted Ivy on the head. \u201cWho saved me from the big scary spider? Yes, you did!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grabbed Ivy and cradled her to his chest. She licked him once across his right cheek and allowed him to just hold her. Her soft fur and warm little body immediately calmed Dan down. He buried his nose in her fur and just breathed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, Sammy helped, too,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank him after his snack,\u201d Dan said. He closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see or hear anything right now.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, I was about to go and do something about the spider,\u201d Phil pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd you decided to do that after you tried to bully me into doing it even though you are well aware that I\u2019m terrified of spiders?\u201d Dan snarled. He looked up to give Phil his dirtiest look. Phil did have the decency to look ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd it was uncalled for to call me a crap friend,\u201d Dan mumbled and buried his face in Ivy\u2019s fur again. Ivy gave a little huff and lay her head on Dan\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I was just so scared myself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grumbled, but didn\u2019t look up. He was actually angry with Phil this time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you some tea,\u201d Phil said and rushed out of the room.</p>\n\n<p>Dan stayed on the sofa with Ivy, counting his inhales. At some point, Sammy decided to jumped up to lay down next to Dan. He sprawled out and yawned, lying down to take what Dan presumed to be a digestive nap.</p>\n\n<p>Only when Dan felt his heartbeat slow down, he leaned back and let Ivy lie across his lap. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes from scanning every corner of the room for more spiders. He continued to do that until Phil came back into the office, carrying two mugs and a packet of hobnobs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan wordlessly took the offered mug and sipped it. He refused to look at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sat next to Dan and sipped his own tea. They both said nothing for a while.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI sometimes forget how bad it is for you,\u201d Phil said eventually.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLike, actually, really, deeply, sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan you ever forgive me, Daniel?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed at Phil\u2019s overly theatrical voice. He was sure that Phil had also pulled all registers by whipping out his best puppy-dog eyes.</p>\n\n<p>And sure enough, when Dan turned to look at Phil, his friend was giving him his best wounded-puppy-look.

Enjoy!\n\n[[MORE]]</p>\n<p>CHAPTER 8: The Spider Trap</p>\n<p>Somehow, Dan had managed to survive the Lester-Birthday-Festivities and before he knew it, it was already February.</p>\n\n<p>It had been over two weeks since Dan had posted a search tweet on twitter. Shortly after that, he and Phil had gone to their nearest animal shelter and pet shop to put up notices about Sammy. They even went to the vet after one of their very clever subscribers pointed out that Sammy might have a microchip and they could easily find the owner that way \u2013 but there was no microchip to be found. It was really frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Sara also didn\u2019t have any luck in finding a new owner, but she did point out that she was extremely choosy. She had apologized at least a hundred times about that and had offered to take Ivy back any time. Of course, both Dan and Phil had refused. Dan had tried to tell himself that he didn\u2019t like to go back on his word, but if he was completely honest with himself, he kept Ivy because he liked having her around.</p>\n\n<p>It was weird how normal it had become for him to have a dog and a cat around. He had even gotten used to going out with Ivy three times a day (Phil pitched in as well), and he was actually looking forward to their walks. When he could afford to have a day off, which became more and more difficult as their tour approached, Phil would accompany Dan to go drive out to a bigger park. They would play fetch with Ivy and actually spent more than half an hour outside at a time. At those times, Dan wished that he and Phil lived on the outskirts of London so they could take Ivy somewhere nice more frequently, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind where they were going as long as she got to play outside.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank back in his office chair and sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. Ivy was snoozing by his feet, while Sammy had decided to take up residency on Phil\u2019s lap. Phil was sitting on the chair next to Dan, his laptop in front of him. He ignored it while he searched for something on his phone. Or maybe he was just scrolling through tumblr. Dan couldn\u2019t quite understand why Phil didn\u2019t just use his laptop to do whatever he was doing, but then again, it was Phil. He rarely made sense.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at the fluffy ball lying at his feet. Ivy was completely dead to the world, her ears twitching from time to time. She was so peaceful, and Dan had gotten so used to her presence that he honestly couldn\u2019t imagine her leaving. He thought about this more and more these days because just a few days ago Sara had texted him that she might have found someone who fit the bill.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked over at Phil from the corner of his eyes. Phil didn\u2019t know about this. Dan wasn\u2019t all too keen on telling him, either. He could tell that Phil was already way too hung up on Sammy, and Ivy had a special place in his heart, too.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few weeks, Phil had dropped some very obvious hints about keeping Ivy. Dan wasn\u2019t against having a dog per se, but there were just so many things to keep in mind. The city. The tour. Their lives. Who knew when one of them would meet someone and move out, and then who would keep Ivy?</p>\n\n<p>To Dan, all of these things just sounded like lazy excuses. They could actually work around most difficulties with Ivy there. Even the possibility of them separating could be figured out (but Dan guessed that this wouldn\u2019t happen all too soon for several reasons). He couldn\u2019t really put his finger on why he was unable to say yes to all of this. Maybe it was because Sara had finally found someone, and Dan didn\u2019t want to take away the dog from them? Was it because he was scared?</p>\n\n<p>Dan gave another sigh and sank further into his chair, glaring at his laptop as if it was at fault for not writing the script for his latest video.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Phil asked and regarded Dan with a curious glance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said and sat up straight again. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do about this script.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe come back to it later? Have a break?\u201d Phil suggested. He looked back at his phone and absentmindedly patted Sammy\u2019s back. The cat purred and closed its eyes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you retweet the search tweet?\u201d Dan asked and stood up to flop down on the couch behind them. Ivy stirred, but didn\u2019t get up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cJust this morning,\u201d Phil said, not taking his eyes off his phone. \u201cDidn\u2019t get anything back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan pursed his lips and stared at the ceiling. Then he looked back at Phil with furrowed brows. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to write your disstrack?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am writing my disstrack. I\u2019m just taking a little break, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cU-hu,\u201d Dan said, looking back at the ceiling. For some reason, his brain felt empty. Maybe it was still the aftermath of Phil\u2019s birthday get-together the day before. It had been the third one in a row, and Dan hadn\u2019t been able to talk himself out of that one or the ones before. Maybe he should just book a holiday for next year and escape the socializing hell until it was over and celebrate Phil\u2019s birthday with him in peace afterwards. Just the two of them, that would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>As it so often did, Dan\u2019s gaze wandered and fell on Ivy\u2019s sleeping form on the floor. It really didn\u2019t matter what she did, she was always so damn adorable Dan couldn\u2019t really decided whether he wanted to turn into a puddle or scream with joy. He fished his phone out of his pocket and snapped a picture of Ivy. He sent it straight to Sara. After all, he had to keep her updated on Ivy\u2019s well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Dan let his hand fall back on the sofa. He stared back at the ceiling, as if it was able to give him the script he needed. It didn\u2019t, obviously. But it was worth a try.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe he should just get up, move around a bit and while he was at it, get a drink. Hydration was important to keep your brain working. Dan flung himself onto his feet and headed for the door.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHey Phil, I\u2019m gonna get myself some water, do you \u2013\u201d Dan started but didn\u2019t finish as he let out a very high-pitched scream and scrambled back to the sofa, startling Phil, Sammy and Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA spider!\u201d Dan screamed and jumped on the sofa, waving his hands frantically in the general direction of the door. \u201cSpider!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The spider was a gigantic, hairy monster that was just casually walking through the door and into the office like it owned the place. At least that\u2019s how Dan saw it. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t be all too sure, as his phobia tended to transform and pull at his vision as soon as he spotted a spider.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had whipped his head around, spotted the spider, squeaked, dropped his phone on the desk and followed Dan onto the sofa. In the process he had dislodged a disgruntled Sammy and almost fell over in his haste to get to Dan.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTake it away, take it away!\u201d Phil squeaked, gripping Dan\u2019s arm hard and attempting to hide behind Dan\u2019s back.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you do it!\u201d Dan squeaked back, grabbing Phil\u2019s arm and pushing him away. He would not be a human shield between Phil and a fucking spider.</p>\n\n<p>For about two minutes Dan and Phil wrestled on the sofa, trying to push each other in front of themselves. Dan didn\u2019t let his eyes loose sight of the spider, which at some point stopped dead in its tracks, as if to consider which way to go and wreck more havoc.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStop it Phil!\u201d Dan said and shoved Phil hard, almost throwing him off the sofa. Phil squealed, his arms flailing in the air to regain his balance. When he was standing upright again, he gave Dan a dirty look. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst friend ever,\u201d Phil declared.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dan said without looking away from the spider. \u201cHow about we figure out what to do?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so not going to get down from this sofa,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMe neither!\u201d Dan said and finally looked up at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at Dan. \u201cYou know exactly what that means.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! We can\u2019t rock-paper-sicssors about this!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes we can! How else are we supposed to ever get down from the sofa?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan mirrored Phil\u2019s stance and hissed angrily, \u201cI am an arachnophobic, I just can\u2019t, Phil!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of spiders, too!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more afraid of spiders than you!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, I am!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTwice that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan stomped his foot, which elicited an ominous cracking sound from the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s so unfair! I listed my fear of spiders in TABINOF while you talked about horses!\u201d Dan gave Phil an evil grin. \u201cHow about you pick up the spider and I promise to remove any stray horse from your sight should we encounter one?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil stomped his foot, too, and the sofa cracked again. \u201cNot fair! We don\u2019t leave the house often enough to actually meet any horses!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible!\u201d Dan shouted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think you are a crap friend!\u201d Phil shouted back.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could retort something really nasty, Ivy barked. He whipped his head around to see her standing over the spider, looking from it back to Dan and Phil on the sofa. The spider was completely frozen. A bit to the side stood Sammy, regarding the spider warily.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, everyone was still. Dan held his breath. Then, Ivy extended a curious paw to poke the spider. Before her paw could even so much as touch it, the spider scrambled backwards. Ivy jumped and gave an angry bark. Phil squeaked again. Dan couldn\u2019t help but jump as well as soon as he saw the spider move. He could feel his heart rate pick up in speed, and he felt a faint nausea in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n\n<p>The spider stumbled towards the nearest wall which happened to be the one next to the desk. </p>\n\n<p><em>It definitely wants to hide,</em> Dan thought, and oh fucking hell, if it got behind the desk they would never be able to get it out there.</p>\n\n<p>Dan\u2019s gaze fell on Sammy who had, as soon as the spider had started moving again, ducked. He was watching the spider\u2019s every move narrowly, but he didn\u2019t move so much as an inch. Ivy was still barking, and Dan was torn about what to do. Someone had to do something, but he felt like he was glued to the sofa, his knees shaking from the mere thought of getting near that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly there was a flurry of movement, and it all happened at the same time; to his left, Phil jumped down from the sofa, stalking towards the desk; Sammy leaped on top of the spider, and Ivy pounced on it, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan heard Phil gasp as he fell back a little. They both watched their pets\u2019 flailing limbs. Dan couldn\u2019t make out what happened until Ivy stepped back and gave him a good view of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was lying on the floor, his paws on the spider, which looked pretty dead to Dan from where he stood. It at least seemed a lot flatter than before. Dan could barely make out the tips of its legs poking out from under Sammy\u2019s paw.</p>\n\n<p>And then Sammy leaned forward and swallowed the spider in one gulp. Dan and Phil gasped in disgust and Dan averted his gaze. He really couldn\u2019t watch Sammy chewing on that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank down on the sofa, shaking all over. He took in a deep breath and counted each inhale and exhale to calm his racing heart. It was over, the spider was gone for good, and all would be fine. Dan knew, however, that he would obsessively check his surroundings for more spiders for the rest of the day. Working on his script at all was not going to happen today. Great.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Phil asked. Dan looked up at Phil, who regarded him anxiously. \u201cYou look a bit pale.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dan said through gritted teeth. He looked away from Phil and spotted Ivy, who was walking over to him with her tail wagging.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s a good girl?\u201d Dan cooed and patted Ivy on the head. \u201cWho saved me from the big scary spider? Yes, you did!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grabbed Ivy and cradled her to his chest. She licked him once across his right cheek and allowed him to just hold her. Her soft fur and warm little body immediately calmed Dan down. He buried his nose in her fur and just breathed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, Sammy helped, too,\u201d Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank him after his snack,\u201d Dan said. He closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to see or hear anything right now.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, I was about to go and do something about the spider,\u201d Phil pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd you decided to do that after you tried to bully me into doing it even though you are well aware that I\u2019m terrified of spiders?\u201d Dan snarled. He looked up to give Phil his dirtiest look. Phil did have the decency to look ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd it was uncalled for to call me a crap friend,\u201d Dan mumbled and buried his face in Ivy\u2019s fur again. Ivy gave a little huff and lay her head on Dan\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Phil said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I was just so scared myself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan grumbled, but didn\u2019t look up. He was actually angry with Phil this time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you some tea,\u201d Phil said and rushed out of the room.</p>\n\n<p>Dan stayed on the sofa with Ivy, counting his inhales. At some point, Sammy decided to jumped up to lay down next to Dan. He sprawled out and yawned, lying down to take what Dan presumed to be a digestive nap.</p>\n\n<p>Only when Dan felt his heartbeat slow down, he leaned back and let Ivy lie across his lap. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes from scanning every corner of the room for more spiders. He continued to do that until Phil came back into the office, carrying two mugs and a packet of hobnobs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan wordlessly took the offered mug and sipped it. He refused to look at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sat next to Dan and sipped his own tea. They both said nothing for a while.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI sometimes forget how bad it is for you,\u201d Phil said eventually.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLike, actually, really, deeply, sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCan you ever forgive me, Daniel?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed at Phil\u2019s overly theatrical voice. He was sure that Phil had also pulled all registers by whipping out his best puppy-dog eyes.</p>\n\n<p>And sure enough, when Dan turned to look at Phil, his friend was giving him his best wounded-puppy-look. Dan rolled his eyes at him, but couldn\u2019t stop himself from smiling. \u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s fine, just stop looking at me like that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to sip on his tea, a smug smile on his face. Dan rolled his eyes again. Phil really was impossible.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDid you know that spiders have to pump blood into their legs to be able to move?\u201d Phil asked out of the blue.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dan said, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t think I really wanted to know that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like their having a mini-errection every time they move a leg!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEw, Phil!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Phil just laughed at Dan\u2019s outraged expression. Dan couldn\u2019t help but join in, but not after giving his friend a playful slap on the shoulder. \u201cWhere the hell do you get facts like that?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA podcast,\u201d Phil said, idly patting Sammy on the head.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at the cat lying between himself and Phil. Dan was glad that all the remainders of the spider were safe in Sammy\u2019s tummy and not on the floor or his face. Dan raised his hand and scratched Sammy behind the ears. Sammy instantly went into purring-mode, and- Dan smiled down at his tiny savior. Ivy raised her head in curiosity, but stayed put on Dan\u2019s lap.</p>\n\n<p>Right at that moment Dan couldn\u2019t help but hope that Sammy actually didn\u2019t have a previous owner. And that Sara would be unable to find a new owner for Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sat there, patting Sammy and smiling to himself. He was completely happy with everyone and the world.</p>\n\n<p>Phil coughed. \u201cDan?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked up to see Phil looking at his phone with an unreadable expression.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSammy\u2019s owner found us.\u201d</p></p>",

Then he looked back at Phil with furrowed brows. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to write your disstrack?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am writing my disstrack. I&rsquo;m just taking a little break, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;U-hu,&rdquo; Dan said, looking back at the ceiling. For some reason, his brain felt empty. Maybe it was still the aftermath of Phil&rsquo;s birthday get-together the day before. It had been the third one in a row, and Dan hadn&rsquo;t been able to talk himself out of that one or the ones before. Maybe he should just book a holiday for next year and escape the socializing hell until it was over and celebrate Phil&rsquo;s birthday with him in peace afterwards. Just the two of them, that would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>As it so often did, Dan&rsquo;s gaze wandered and fell on Ivy&rsquo;s sleeping form on the floor. It really didn&rsquo;t matter what she did, she was always so damn adorable Dan couldn&rsquo;t really decided whether he wanted to turn into a puddle or scream with joy. He fished his phone out of his pocket and snapped a picture of Ivy. He sent it straight to Sara. After all, he had to keep her updated on Ivy&rsquo;s well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Dan let his hand fall back on the sofa. He stared back at the ceiling, as if it was able to give him the script he needed. It didn&rsquo;t, obviously. But it was worth a try.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe he should just get up, move around a bit and while he was at it, get a drink. Hydration was important to keep your brain working. Dan flung himself onto his feet and headed for the door.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hey Phil, I&rsquo;m gonna get myself some water, do you &ndash;&rdquo; Dan started but didn&rsquo;t finish as he let out a very high-pitched scream and scrambled back to the sofa, startling Phil, Sammy and Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A spider!&rdquo; Dan screamed and jumped on the sofa, waving his hands frantically in the general direction of the door. &ldquo;Spider!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The spider was a gigantic, hairy monster that was just casually walking through the door and into the office like it owned the place. At least that&rsquo;s how Dan saw it. Sometimes he couldn&rsquo;t be all too sure, as his phobia tended to transform and pull at his vision as soon as he spotted a spider.</p>\n\n<p>Phil had whipped his head around, spotted the spider, squeaked, dropped his phone on the desk and followed Dan onto the sofa. In the process he had dislodged a disgruntled Sammy and almost fell over in his haste to get to Dan.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Take it away, take it away!&rdquo; Phil squeaked, gripping Dan&rsquo;s arm hard and attempting to hide behind Dan&rsquo;s back.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, you do it!&rdquo; Dan squeaked back, grabbing Phil&rsquo;s arm and pushing him away. He would not be a human shield between Phil and a fucking spider.</p>\n\n<p>For about two minutes Dan and Phil wrestled on the sofa, trying to push each other in front of themselves. Dan didn&rsquo;t let his eyes loose sight of the spider, which at some point stopped dead in its tracks, as if to consider which way to go and wreck more havoc.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Stop it Phil!&rdquo; Dan said and shoved Phil hard, almost throwing him off the sofa. Phil squealed, his arms flailing in the air to regain his balance. When he was standing upright again, he gave Dan a dirty look. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the worst friend ever,&rdquo; Phil declared.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Dan said without looking away from the spider. &ldquo;How about we figure out what to do?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so not going to get down from this sofa,&rdquo; Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Me neither!&rdquo; Dan said and finally looked up at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at Dan. &ldquo;You know exactly what that means.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious! We can&rsquo;t rock-paper-sicssors about this!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes we can! How else are we supposed to ever get down from the sofa?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan mirrored Phil&rsquo;s stance and hissed angrily, &ldquo;I am an arachnophobic, I just can&rsquo;t, Phil!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of spiders, too!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more afraid of spiders than you!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, you aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Twice that!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan stomped his foot, which elicited an ominous cracking sound from the sofa. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so unfair! I listed my fear of spiders in TABINOF while you talked about horses!&rdquo; Dan gave Phil an evil grin. &ldquo;How about you pick up the spider and I promise to remove any stray horse from your sight should we encounter one?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil stomped his foot, too, and the sofa cracked again. &ldquo;Not fair! We don&rsquo;t leave the house often enough to actually meet any horses!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Dan shouted.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think you are a crap friend!&rdquo; Phil shouted back.</p>\n\n<p>Before Dan could retort something really nasty, Ivy barked. He whipped his head around to see her standing over the spider, looking from it back to Dan and Phil on the sofa. The spider was completely frozen. A bit to the side stood Sammy, regarding the spider warily.</p>\n\n<p>For a moment, everyone was still. Dan held his breath. Then, Ivy extended a curious paw to poke the spider. Before her paw could even so much as touch it, the spider scrambled backwards. Ivy jumped and gave an angry bark. Phil squeaked again. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but jump as well as soon as he saw the spider move. He could feel his heart rate pick up in speed, and he felt a faint nausea in the pit of his stomach.</p>\n\n<p>The spider stumbled towards the nearest wall which happened to be the one next to the desk. </p>\n\n<p><em>It definitely wants to hide,</em> Dan thought, and oh fucking hell, if it got behind the desk they would never be able to get it out there.</p>\n\n<p>Dan&rsquo;s gaze fell on Sammy who had, as soon as the spider had started moving again, ducked. He was watching the spider&rsquo;s every move narrowly, but he didn&rsquo;t move so much as an inch. Ivy was still barking, and Dan was torn about what to do. Someone had to do something, but he felt like he was glued to the sofa, his knees shaking from the mere thought of getting near that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly there was a flurry of movement, and it all happened at the same time; to his left, Phil jumped down from the sofa, stalking towards the desk; Sammy leaped on top of the spider, and Ivy pounced on it, too.</p>\n\n<p>Dan heard Phil gasp as he fell back a little. They both watched their pets&rsquo; flailing limbs. Dan couldn&rsquo;t make out what happened until Ivy stepped back and gave him a good view of Sammy.</p>\n\n<p>Sammy was lying on the floor, his paws on the spider, which looked pretty dead to Dan from where he stood. It at least seemed a lot flatter than before. Dan could barely make out the tips of its legs poking out from under Sammy&rsquo;s paw.</p>\n\n<p>And then Sammy leaned forward and swallowed the spider in one gulp. Dan and Phil gasped in disgust and Dan averted his gaze. He really couldn&rsquo;t watch Sammy chewing on that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sank down on the sofa, shaking all over. He took in a deep breath and counted each inhale and exhale to calm his racing heart. It was over, the spider was gone for good, and all would be fine. Dan knew, however, that he would obsessively check his surroundings for more spiders for the rest of the day. Working on his script at all was not going to happen today. Great.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Phil asked. Dan looked up at Phil, who regarded him anxiously. &ldquo;You look a bit pale.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Dan said through gritted teeth. He looked away from Phil and spotted Ivy, who was walking over to him with her tail wagging.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a good girl?&rdquo; Dan cooed and patted Ivy on the head. &ldquo;Who saved me from the big scary spider? Yes, you did!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan grabbed Ivy and cradled her to his chest. She licked him once across his right cheek and allowed him to just hold her. Her soft fur and warm little body immediately calmed Dan down. He buried his nose in her fur and just breathed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know, Sammy helped, too,&rdquo; Phil said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank him after his snack,&rdquo; Dan said. He closed his eyes. He didn&rsquo;t want to see or hear anything right now.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You know, I was about to go and do something about the spider,&rdquo; Phil pointed out.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And you decided to do that after you tried to bully me into doing it even though you are well aware that I&rsquo;m terrified of spiders?&rdquo; Dan snarled. He looked up to give Phil his dirtiest look. Phil did have the decency to look ashamed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;And it was uncalled for to call me a crap friend,&rdquo; Dan mumbled and buried his face in Ivy&rsquo;s fur again. Ivy gave a little huff and lay her head on Dan&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it. I was just so scared myself.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan grumbled, but didn&rsquo;t look up. He was actually angry with Phil this time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you some tea,&rdquo; Phil said and rushed out of the room.</p>\n\n<p>Dan stayed on the sofa with Ivy, counting his inhales. At some point, Sammy decided to jumped up to lay down next to Dan. He sprawled out and yawned, lying down to take what Dan presumed to be a digestive nap.</p>\n\n<p>Only when Dan felt his heartbeat slow down, he leaned back and let Ivy lie across his lap. He couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes from scanning every corner of the room for more spiders. He continued to do that until Phil came back into the office, carrying two mugs and a packet of hobnobs.</p>\n\n<p>Dan wordlessly took the offered mug and sipped it. He refused to look at Phil.</p>\n\n<p>Phil sat next to Dan and sipped his own tea. They both said nothing for a while.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I sometimes forget how bad it is for you,&rdquo; Phil said eventually.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Like, actually, really, deeply, sorry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me, Daniel?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan sighed at Phil&rsquo;s overly theatrical voice. He was sure that Phil had also pulled all registers by whipping out his best puppy-dog eyes.</p>\n\n<p>And sure enough, when Dan turned to look at Phil, his friend was giving him his best wounded-puppy-look. Dan rolled his eyes at him, but couldn&rsquo;t stop himself from smiling. &ldquo;Alright, alright, it&rsquo;s fine, just stop looking at me like that!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil turned to sip on his tea, a smug smile on his face. Dan rolled his eyes again. Phil really was impossible.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Did you know that spiders have to pump blood into their legs to be able to move?&rdquo; Phil asked out of the blue.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan said, wrinkling his nose in disgust. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I really wanted to know that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like their having a mini-errection every time they move a leg!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ew, Phil!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Phil just laughed at Dan&rsquo;s outraged expression. Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but join in, but not after giving his friend a playful slap on the shoulder. &ldquo;Where the hell do you get facts like that?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A podcast,&rdquo; Phil said, idly patting Sammy on the head.</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked down at the cat lying between himself and Phil. Dan was glad that all the remainders of the spider were safe in Sammy&rsquo;s tummy and not on the floor or his face. Dan raised his hand and scratched Sammy behind the ears. Sammy instantly went into purring-mode, and- Dan smiled down at his tiny savior. Ivy raised her head in curiosity, but stayed put on Dan&rsquo;s lap.</p>\n\n<p>Right at that moment Dan couldn&rsquo;t help but hope that Sammy actually didn&rsquo;t have a previous owner. And that Sara would be unable to find a new owner for Ivy.</p>\n\n<p>Dan sat there, patting Sammy and smiling to himself. He was completely happy with everyone and the world.</p>\n\n<p>Phil coughed. &ldquo;Dan?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Dan looked up to see Phil looking at his phone with an unreadable expression.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sammy&rsquo;s owner found us.&rdquo;</p></p>",
