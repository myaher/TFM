At least he got to know that Benjen was alive the whole time. I really hope Bran tells him what happened to Benjen, Jon deserves to know why he didn\u2019t come back to the Nights Watch.

I mean look at the Wight Hunt Squad, they are just the coolest dudes ever.</p><p>1) We have Jon Snow, King in the North, who is literally the character most of us can identify most with. He is fearless and doesn\u2019t even wait a second to do the things that need to be done, even if it means to sacrifice himself. I mean, he has done that..how often again? I just love him, i almost jumped from my bed out of excitement and fear because I was scared he wouldn\u2019t make it to Drogon\u2018s back, which he didn\u2019t, but still\u2026                                                                            </p><p>2) We have Ser Jorah Mormont, about whom I have written my previous post. Enough said, I think.</p><p>3) We have Tormund, who is also one of the funniest, wittiest and actually quite wise characters (maybe I\u2019ll do another post about him). I just can\u2019t see Jon Snow going anywhere without him.</p><p>4) Then we have the Brotherhood without Banners, which means we have Beric Dondarion (who is btw way too underrated, might do a post about him too xD), Thoros Of Myr (I\u2019m quite glad that he had such a \u201cpeaceful\u201d death, i mean, who gets do die in their sleep in GoT??) and the Hound. Do i need to say more than Sandor Clegane absolutely roasting Gendry about whining all the time?? Funniest scene in the whole episode.</p><p>This is literally the best squad in the whole series to this point. My favorite underrated characters (besides Jon Snow ofc) all at once? With such cool scenes? Man I loved that. On an emotional level, I accompanied them on their journey. And hello?? Jon Snow getting to see Benjen again, even if he died shortly after? At least he got to know that Benjen was alive the whole time. I really hope Bran tells him what happened to Benjen, Jon deserves to know why he didn\u2019t come back to the Nights Watch. Even though I felt really really bad for Dany and Viserion (bc I just can\u2019t get enough of dragons) I think the story finally begins to set wheels in motion. I\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s gonna happen in episode 7 and season 8!!</p></p>",

The strength of Game of Thrones came right from the details thanks to the incredible world that George R. R. Martin created and D &amp; D destroyed. So no, I will not spare you them.</p><p>- The beginning was good. I just do not understand why Jon made his speech without looking at the survivors of Winterfell.</p><p>- The party dinner was generally good. In these last seasons, Game of Thrones has managed to maintain a good quality in the interaction between characthers. Episode 2 was basically all that and it was good for me. The problem is when GoT starts off for the story \u00a0- which is already lost.</p><p>- Daenerys\u2019s loneliness was well portrayed. Too bad the series prematurely killed Selmy Barristan, did not it?</p><p>- First failure of attention to detail that detracts from the series\u2019 worldbuilding: Gendry Rivers, what? Is he from the Riverlands, by any chance? Bastard born and raised in King\u2019s Landing is named after Waters. His name was Gendry Waters (actually it was just Gendry, since Robert never recognized him as his bastard son). Why change that, D &amp; D? To be different?</p><p>- I wish Gendry good luck trying to persuade the Storm lords to bend over to a bastard who does not understand a thing about ruling a castle. But of course the series will not talk about that. At least they did not give Storm\u2019s to Brienne or to Davos (by the way, when the Davos family will show up?)</p><p>- Leaving a bit out of order, but taking advantage of feudal politics, what\u2019s going on in Dorne?\u201d D &amp; D mentioned a new Prince of Dorne who swore loyalty to Daenerys. Hi? What? When? Who? WHY??? D &amp; D had the brilliant idea of \u200b\u200bmaking the Martells exterminate each other and still reap the rewards of their genius. Dorne remains the worst arc in the series and quite possibly one of the worst book-media visual adaptations ever.</p><p>- They also mentioned Riverrun again. What happened to the Riverlands after the Freys all died? Where is Edmure Tully? Who controls Riverrun?</p><p>- Writers creating a whole scene by saying that Brienne is a virgin. Not necessary.</p><p>- There was not a crippled nephew of Daeron Targaryen. D &amp; D creating Targaryens whenever they want, although there is a well-defined story in the books. (FIRE AND BLOOD)</p><p>- There was finally a scene between Sandor and Sansa. It only took 4 episodes to happen. Once again they put Sansa as the product of her suffering, justifying the idiot choices D &amp; D made for her character. Nothing new, otherwise it was a totally forgettable dialogue (I already forgot).</p><p>- The Bronn Paradox: If Bronn is not serving Daenerys while the war is rolling, who guarantees that he will receive his castle in the end? Especially considering he was utterly disillusioned with the promises of the Lannisters to the point of being ready to kill his two best friends? In fact, did D &amp; D forget that Jaime himself had offered Highgarden to the Bronn last season?</p><p>- Again, as for Gendry, I wish Bronn good luck in trying to establish his feudal dominion over the proud lords of Highgarden who did not even tolerate the right Tyrells, and the Tyrells were an old family and had already been entrenched in there for centuries. Of course, D &amp; D do not care.</p><p>- The Paradox of the Wildlings: Why were they known as wildlings? Because they tried to conquer the Wall from time to time and were always looting the North in search of resources and riches. Because their land was a shit, where nothing grew and it was always winter, basically. Now the they finally made it through the Wall and gain access to the best lands, even more with the support of the Winterfell and Starks. What do they do? That\u2019s right: they go back to their shit place because D &amp; D have that same shit on their heads.</p><p>- What else is north of Winterfell and south of the Wall are lands with no one, thanks to the King of the Night.\u201c But the wildlings choose to go back to Castle Black and, by all means, beyond the Wall. Seven Hells.</p><p>- I will not even comment on Jon\u2019s scene sending Ghost away.\u201d If it was for him to appear that way, it was better for the wolf to have been m.i.a as before.</p><p>- Sam Tarly is a Night\u2019s Watch man. Men of Night\u2019s Watch should not have children. When will anyone say that? Did not Jon even mention it? What happened to Night\u2019s Watch? Why is Sam still dressed in black? If he\u2019s out, why did not he become Lord Tarly?</p><p>- The arc of Night\u2019s Watch is going to be without conclusion anyway? Are they gone?</p><p>- The army of the living has lost only half its men? It was not what it looked like in episode 3. But okay, D &amp; D create and describe armies whenever they think it\u2019s valid - just like Night\u2019s Watch, apparently.</p><p>- As they are doing this season, D &amp; D cut important dialogue scenes because they do not know what to write. In the first episode they cut off Daenerys before she finished threatening Sansa. In the second episode they cut their scene together before Dany could answer the question \u201cWhat about the North?\u201d. At the end of it cut the scene Jon x Dany in the crypts. Now they cut the scene of Sansa and Arya discovering that Jon is not their brother. Why, man? What is the reason? I\u2019m shocked that D &amp; D did not cut Jon\u2019s reaction to finding out that he\u2019s a bastard of Rhaegar and Lyanna (yes, he\u2019s a bastard, D &amp; D, no matter how many fanfics they write).</p><p>- Arya in the first moment: we are a family! Arya in 2nd moment: left King\u2019s Landing, goodbye Winterfell, until never again! and yes she left for good, she said she ain\u2019t coming back!</p><p>That was the good part of the episode. Let\u2019s go to the bad part!!</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Euron can hit three harpoons in a dragon in mid-flight?\u201c</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Daenerys from the sky was unable to see the Greyjoy fleet hidden behind an islet?\u201d</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Daenerys never considered the possibility that it was a bad idea to sail to Dragonstone as they knew Euron controlled the seas there?\u201c</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Rhaegal was not killed by the zombie dragon brother in the apocalyptic Battle of the long night fighting for the fate of the men\u2019s kingdom only to die in the next episode in a few seconds for Euron Greyjoy\u2019s magical harpoons?</p><p>-So you want to tell me how easy it is to kill dragons like that?\u201d It amazes me that Aegon conquered Westeros three hundred years ago.</p><p>- Daenerys should have flown directly to King\u2019s Landing and fired at everything after the Rhaegal\u2019s death. Fire and Blood!!</p><p>- Jaime returning to Cersei: hi? What the fuck? If it is to join her and not kill her right away, Jaime will be the greatest example of character assassination that D &amp; D has committed since Stannis Baratheon.</p><p>- How did Team Dany know that Missandei had been captured? Euron made propaganda, sent in the email?</p><p>- Is Varys loyal to Jon Snow? REALLY? What does Varys know about Jon Snow? When did he meet Jon Snow? When did they share at least one scene together? They never talked. Varys never saw him rule. Where do the writers get these crazy ideas?</p><p>- Nonsense to be creating intrigue over the marriage between Jon and Daenerys. She will need to get married to have children and continue the dynasty. Who is she getting married to, Hot Pie? </p><p>- By the way, there have been marriages between uncles and nieces among the Starks. Brothers Jonnel and Edric Stark married their nieces Serena and Sansa Stark some 150 years ago to try to end a crisis of succession, since their father, Rickon, heir to Winterfell, had been killed in the conquest of Dorne. It would not surprise me if GRRM specifically placed these marriages in history just for this situation that was raised in the conversation between Tyrion and Varys. In fact, marriages between uncles and nieces were not exactly uncommon in our own history. In Brasil, Dom Pedro I was grandson of D. Maria I of Portugal, who was married to his uncle, D. Pedro III, precisely to avoid a dynastic crisis.</p><p>- Again the bullshit that Robert\u2019s Rebellion was built on a lie. I imagine the Crazy King burning the Lord of Winterfell and his heir and begging for Ned and Robert\u2019s head did not influence that at all.</p><p>- Dany is an emotional woman who\u2019s going crazy. So we need a rational man to help her.</p><p>- Dany is an emotional woman who\u2019s going crazy. So we need a rational man to help her!!</p><p>- Oh, excuse me if I repeated myself, but this nonsense does not go down. They disrespected Daenerys, disrespected her journey, disrespected even the \u201cgirl power\u201d they tried to do last season (Dany, Olenna Tyrell, Cersei and the Martells). The mysoginism of these so-called D &amp; D appearing once more to claim another innocent victim.</p><p>- Why did Cersei not kill Tyrion?</p><p>- Why did Cersei not kill Daenerys?</p><p>- Euron does not suspect anything after Tyrion reveals he knew Cersei was pregnant?\u201c Since Euron himelf knew only minutes ago?</p><p>- D &amp; D really put an end to the apocalypse so we can have Cersei grinning in the last three episodes? Is this serious?</p><p>- Euron is Cersei\u2019s puppy. Euron in the series is another completely character , they should have changed his name in the adaptation as they did with the Asha (Yara).</p><p>- No turning back with the Night King. D &amp; D make us muggles.</p><p>- Finally: where\u2019s the winter ??? It seems King\u2019s Landing is in the tropics.</p><p>- Cancel this and the next two episodes. Let GoT finish in episode 3, at least so we would have something minimally satisfying. D &amp; D continue to insult the viewer\u2019s intelligence.</p><p>&ldquo;At least the show\u2019s songs never fails to please.\u201d</p><p>*this analysis is not mine I translated from a brazilian friend</p>",

The strength of Game of Thrones came right from the details thanks to the incredible world that George R. R. Martin created and D &amp; D destroyed. So no, I will not spare you them.</p><p>- The beginning was good. I just do not understand why Jon made his speech without looking at the survivors of Winterfell.</p><p>- The party dinner was generally good. In these last seasons, Game of Thrones has managed to maintain a good quality in the interaction between characthers. Episode 2 was basically all that and it was good for me. The problem is when GoT starts off for the story \u00a0- which is already lost.</p><p>- Daenerys\u2019s loneliness was well portrayed. Too bad the series prematurely killed Selmy Barristan, did not it?</p><p>- First failure of attention to detail that detracts from the series\u2019 worldbuilding: Gendry Rivers, what? Is he from the Riverlands, by any chance? Bastard born and raised in King\u2019s Landing is named after Waters. His name was Gendry Waters (actually it was just Gendry, since Robert never recognized him as his bastard son). Why change that, D &amp; D? To be different?</p><p>- I wish Gendry good luck trying to persuade the Storm lords to bend over to a bastard who does not understand a thing about ruling a castle. But of course the series will not talk about that. At least they did not give Storm\u2019s to Brienne or to Davos (by the way, when the Davos family will show up?)</p><p>- Leaving a bit out of order, but taking advantage of feudal politics, what\u2019s going on in Dorne?\u201d D &amp; D mentioned a new Prince of Dorne who swore loyalty to Daenerys. Hi? What? When? Who? WHY??? D &amp; D had the brilliant idea of \u200b\u200bmaking the Martells exterminate each other and still reap the rewards of their genius. Dorne remains the worst arc in the series and quite possibly one of the worst book-media visual adaptations ever.</p><p>- They also mentioned Riverrun again. What happened to the Riverlands after the Freys all died? Where is Edmure Tully? Who controls Riverrun?</p><p>- Writers creating a whole scene by saying that Brienne is a virgin. Not necessary.</p><p>- There was not a crippled nephew of Daeron Targaryen. D &amp; D creating Targaryens whenever they want, although there is a well-defined story in the books. (FIRE AND BLOOD)</p><p>- There was finally a scene between Sandor and Sansa. It only took 4 episodes to happen. Once again they put Sansa as the product of her suffering, justifying the idiot choices D &amp; D made for her character. Nothing new, otherwise it was a totally forgettable dialogue (I already forgot).</p><p>- The Bronn Paradox: If Bronn is not serving Daenerys while the war is rolling, who guarantees that he will receive his castle in the end? Especially considering he was utterly disillusioned with the promises of the Lannisters to the point of being ready to kill his two best friends? In fact, did D &amp; D forget that Jaime himself had offered Highgarden to the Bronn last season?</p><p>- Again, as for Gendry, I wish Bronn good luck in trying to establish his feudal dominion over the proud lords of Highgarden who did not even tolerate the right Tyrells, and the Tyrells were an old family and had already been entrenched in there for centuries. Of course, D &amp; D do not care.</p><p>- The Paradox of the Wildlings: Why were they known as wildlings? Because they tried to conquer the Wall from time to time and were always looting the North in search of resources and riches. Because their land was a shit, where nothing grew and it was always winter, basically. Now the they finally made it through the Wall and gain access to the best lands, even more with the support of the Winterfell and Starks. What do they do? That\u2019s right: they go back to their shit place because D &amp; D have that same shit on their heads.</p><p>- What else is north of Winterfell and south of the Wall are lands with no one, thanks to the King of the Night.\u201c But the wildlings choose to go back to Castle Black and, by all means, beyond the Wall. Seven Hells.</p><p>- I will not even comment on Jon\u2019s scene sending Ghost away.\u201d If it was for him to appear that way, it was better for the wolf to have been m.i.a as before.</p><p>- Sam Tarly is a Night\u2019s Watch man. Men of Night\u2019s Watch should not have children. When will anyone say that? Did not Jon even mention it? What happened to Night\u2019s Watch? Why is Sam still dressed in black? If he\u2019s out, why did not he become Lord Tarly?</p><p>- The arc of Night\u2019s Watch is going to be without conclusion anyway? Are they gone?</p><p>- The army of the living has lost only half its men? It was not what it looked like in episode 3. But okay, D &amp; D create and describe armies whenever they think it\u2019s valid - just like Night\u2019s Watch, apparently.</p><p>- As they are doing this season, D &amp; D cut important dialogue scenes because they do not know what to write. In the first episode they cut off Daenerys before she finished threatening Sansa. In the second episode they cut their scene together before Dany could answer the question \u201cWhat about the North?\u201d. At the end of it cut the scene Jon x Dany in the crypts. Now they cut the scene of Sansa and Arya discovering that Jon is not their brother. Why, man? What is the reason? I\u2019m shocked that D &amp; D did not cut Jon\u2019s reaction to finding out that he\u2019s a bastard of Rhaegar and Lyanna (yes, he\u2019s a bastard, D &amp; D, no matter how many fanfics they write).</p><p>- Arya in the first moment: we are a family! Arya in 2nd moment: left King\u2019s Landing, goodbye Winterfell, until never again! and yes she left for good, she said she ain\u2019t coming back!</p><p>That was the good part of the episode. Let\u2019s go to the bad part!!</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Euron can hit three harpoons in a dragon in mid-flight?\u201c</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Daenerys from the sky was unable to see the Greyjoy fleet hidden behind an islet?\u201d</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Daenerys never considered the possibility that it was a bad idea to sail to Dragonstone as they knew Euron controlled the seas there?\u201c</p><p>- So you want to tell me that Rhaegal was not killed by the zombie dragon brother in the apocalyptic Battle of the long night fighting for the fate of the men\u2019s kingdom only to die in the next episode in a few seconds for Euron Greyjoy\u2019s magical harpoons?</p><p>-So you want to tell me how easy it is to kill dragons like that?\u201d It amazes me that Aegon conquered Westeros three hundred years ago.</p><p>- Daenerys should have flown directly to King\u2019s Landing and fired at everything after the Rhaegal\u2019s death. Fire and Blood!!</p><p>- Jaime returning to Cersei: hi? What the fuck? If it is to join her and not kill her right away, Jaime will be the greatest example of character assassination that D &amp; D has committed since Stannis Baratheon.</p><p>- How did Team Dany know that Missandei had been captured? Euron made propaganda, sent in the email?</p><p>- Is Varys loyal to Jon Snow? REALLY? What does Varys know about Jon Snow? When did he meet Jon Snow? When did they share at least one scene together? They never talked. Varys never saw him rule. Where do the writers get these crazy ideas?</p><p>- Nonsense to be creating intrigue over the marriage between Jon and Daenerys. She will need to get married to have children and continue the dynasty. Who is she getting married to, Hot Pie? </p><p>- By the way, there have been marriages between uncles and nieces among the Starks. Brothers Jonnel and Edric Stark married their nieces Serena and Sansa Stark some 150 years ago to try to end a crisis of succession, since their father, Rickon, heir to Winterfell, had been killed in the conquest of Dorne. It would not surprise me if GRRM specifically placed these marriages in history just for this situation that was raised in the conversation between Tyrion and Varys. In fact, marriages between uncles and nieces were not exactly uncommon in our own history. In Brasil, Dom Pedro I was grandson of D. Maria I of Portugal, who was married to his uncle, D. Pedro III, precisely to avoid a dynastic crisis.</p><p>- Again the bullshit that Robert\u2019s Rebellion was built on a lie. I imagine the Crazy King burning the Lord of Winterfell and his heir and begging for Ned and Robert\u2019s head did not influence that at all.</p><p>- Dany is an emotional woman who\u2019s going crazy. So we need a rational man to help her.</p><p>- Dany is an emotional woman who\u2019s going crazy. So we need a rational man to help her!!</p><p>- Oh, excuse me if I repeated myself, but this nonsense does not go down. They disrespected Daenerys, disrespected her journey, disrespected even the \u201cgirl power\u201d they tried to do last season (Dany, Olenna Tyrell, Cersei and the Martells). The mysoginism of these so-called D &amp; D appearing once more to claim another innocent victim.</p><p>- Why did Cersei not kill Tyrion?</p><p>- Why did Cersei not kill Daenerys?</p><p>- Euron does not suspect anything after Tyrion reveals he knew Cersei was pregnant?\u201c Since Euron himelf knew only minutes ago?</p><p>- D &amp; D really put an end to the apocalypse so we can have Cersei grinning in the last three episodes? Is this serious?</p><p>- Euron is Cersei\u2019s puppy. Euron in the series is another completely character , they should have changed his name in the adaptation as they did with the Asha (Yara).</p><p>- No turning back with the Night King. D &amp; D make us muggles.</p><p>- Finally: where\u2019s the winter ??? It seems King\u2019s Landing is in the tropics.</p><p>- Cancel this and the next two episodes. Let GoT finish in episode 3, at least so we would have something minimally satisfying. D &amp; D continue to insult the viewer\u2019s intelligence.</p><p>\u201cAt least the show\u2019s songs never fails to please.\u201d</p><p>*this analysis is not mine I translated from a brazilian friend</p>",
                "content": "<p>About GoT Episode 4:</p><p>First of all, I&rsquo;m completely exhausted from turning a blind eye to the multiple flaws in the D &amp; D scripts (and it was they who wrote this episode). The strength of Game of Thrones came right from the details thanks to the incredible world that George R. R. Martin created and D &amp; D destroyed. So no, I will not spare you them.</p><p>- The beginning was good. I just do not understand why Jon made his speech without looking at the survivors of Winterfell.</p><p>- The party dinner was generally good. In these last seasons, Game of Thrones has managed to maintain a good quality in the interaction between characthers. Episode 2 was basically all that and it was good for me. The problem is when GoT starts off for the story &nbsp;- which is already lost.</p><p>- Daenerys&rsquo;s loneliness was well portrayed. Too bad the series prematurely killed Selmy Barristan, did not it?</p><p>- First failure of attention to detail that detracts from the series&rsquo; worldbuilding: Gendry Rivers, what? Is he from the Riverlands, by any chance? Bastard born and raised in King&rsquo;s Landing is named after Waters. His name was Gendry Waters (actually it was just Gendry, since Robert never recognized him as his bastard son). Why change that, D &amp; D? To be different?</p><p>- I wish Gendry good luck trying to persuade the Storm lords to bend over to a bastard who does not understand a thing about ruling a castle. But of course the series will not talk about that. At least they did not give Storm&rsquo;s to Brienne or to Davos (by the way, when the Davos family will show up?)</p><p>- Leaving a bit out of order, but taking advantage of feudal politics, what&rsquo;s going on in Dorne?&rdquo; D &amp; D mentioned a new Prince of Dorne who swore loyalty to Daenerys. Hi? What? When? Who? WHY??? D &amp; D had the brilliant idea of &#8203;&#8203;making the Martells exterminate each other and still reap the rewards of their genius. Dorne remains the worst arc in the series and quite possibly one of the worst book-media visual adaptations ever.</p><p>- They also mentioned Riverrun again. What happened to the Riverlands after the Freys all died? Where is Edmure Tully? Who controls Riverrun?</p><p>- Writers creating a whole scene by saying that Brienne is a virgin. Not necessary.</p><p>- There was not a crippled nephew of Daeron Targaryen. D &amp; D creating Targaryens whenever they want, although there is a well-defined story in the books. (FIRE AND BLOOD)</p><p>- There was finally a scene between Sandor and Sansa. It only took 4 episodes to happen. Once again they put Sansa as the product of her suffering, justifying the idiot choices D &amp; D made for her character. Nothing new, otherwise it was a totally forgettable dialogue (I already forgot).</p><p>- The Bronn Paradox: If Bronn is not serving Daenerys while the war is rolling, who guarantees that he will receive his castle in the end? Especially considering he was utterly disillusioned with the promises of the Lannisters to the point of being ready to kill his two best friends? In fact, did D &amp; D forget that Jaime himself had offered Highgarden to the Bronn last season?</p><p>- Again, as for Gendry, I wish Bronn good luck in trying to establish his feudal dominion over the proud lords of Highgarden who did not even tolerate the right Tyrells, and the Tyrells were an old family and had already been entrenched in there for centuries. Of course, D &amp; D do not care.</p><p>- The Paradox of the Wildlings: Why were they known as wildlings? Because they tried to conquer the Wall from time to time and were always looting the North in search of resources and riches. Because their land was a shit, where nothing grew and it was always winter, basically. Now the they finally made it through the Wall and gain access to the best lands, even more with the support of the Winterfell and Starks. What do they do? That&rsquo;s right: they go back to their shit place because D &amp; D have that same shit on their heads.</p><p>- What else is north of Winterfell and south of the Wall are lands with no one, thanks to the King of the Night.&ldquo; But the wildlings choose to go back to Castle Black and, by all means, beyond the Wall. Seven Hells.</p><p>- I will not even comment on Jon&rsquo;s scene sending Ghost away.&rdquo; If it was for him to appear that way, it was better for the wolf to have been m.i.a as before.</p><p>- Sam Tarly is a Night&rsquo;s Watch man. Men of Night&rsquo;s Watch should not have children. When will anyone say that? Did not Jon even mention it? What happened to Night&rsquo;s Watch? Why is Sam still dressed in black? If he&rsquo;s out, why did not he become Lord Tarly?</p><p>- The arc of Night&rsquo;s Watch is going to be without conclusion anyway? Are they gone?</p><p>- The army of the living has lost only half its men? It was not what it looked like in episode 3. But okay, D &amp; D create and describe armies whenever they think it&rsquo;s valid - just like Night&rsquo;s Watch, apparently.</p><p>- As they are doing this season, D &amp; D cut important dialogue scenes because they do not know what to write. In the first episode they cut off Daenerys before she finished threatening Sansa.
