                "content": "<p><b>I know next to nothing about flirting, I&rsquo;m so sorry!</b></p><p><b>&hellip;&hellip;</b></p><p>If there was one thing T.J. loved doing &ndash; aside from basketball and spitting out rhymes &ndash; it was making his boyfriend blush.</p><p>How could he not? </p><p>Cyrus was so incredibly cute when he blushed because it wasn&rsquo;t just his face that would turn red. His ears would too!&nbsp;</p><p>And it was the cutest and most endearing thing T.J. had ever seen in his entire life. </p><p>Even though they had been dating for about a year now, Cyrus still got embarrassed when T.J. was being overly sweet and flirtatious. </p><p>Just like, right now, they were in the library, studying Well, T.J. was trying to study. But, he kept getting distracted by Cyrus, who had hidden his face behind his textbook. All because T.J. said the way he scrunched his nose while reading made him look cuter than a bunny.</p><p>&ldquo;Stooop, we&rsquo;re supposed to be studying,&rdquo; his boyfriend whined.</p><p>&ldquo;But, I <i>am</i> studying.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus peeked at him from above the book, flashing him a pointed look.</p><p>T.J. smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying my boyfriend and figuring out how I can get him to kiss me in public.&rdquo;</p><p>Immediately, the tips of Cyrus&rsquo; ears turned even redder and he hid himself behind the book again. </p><p>&ldquo;People are staring,&rdquo; he hissed.</p><p>T.J. looked around but no one was paying them any attention. They could definitely sneak a kiss, if they wanted.</p><p>And T.J. definitely wanted. A kiss, that is.</p><p>&ldquo;Even with the book in front of your face, you&rsquo;re still the most handsome guy in this entire room,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;No. In the world. No, wait, the entire universe.&rdquo;</p><p>Cyrus didn&rsquo;t move.</p><p>&ldquo;Your handsomeness is out of this world, Cyrus.&rdquo;</p><p>Finally, the book was lowered and T.J. was pleased to see that his boyfriend now resembled a ripe tomato, from the tip of his nose, down his neck, and up to the curved points of his ears. </p><p>So cute. </p><p>&ldquo;If I let you kiss me, will you finally study?&rdquo; Cyrus gave in with a sigh.</p><p>T.J. grinned. &ldquo;All day and every day,&rdquo; he cheekily replied.</p><p>Cyrus sighed again. &ldquo;Fine. Come here.&rdquo;</p><p>Happily, T.J. moved his chair closer to where Cyrus was sitting. He took his time, properly taking in the sight of this wonderful creature he had the honor of calling his boyfriend &ndash; his sparkling eyes, his cute nose, that adorable mole on his cheek. </p><p>How did he get so lucky? What did he do to deserve him?</p><p>&ldquo;Teej?&rdquo; Cyrus interrupted his musings, probably wondering why T.J. wasn&rsquo;t kissing him yet.</p><p>Why wasn&rsquo;t T.J. kissing him yet?</p><p>Grinning, he leaned forward and pressed his lips against Cyrus&rsquo;. He could feel the other boy melting into the kiss as he let out a soft giggle against T.J.&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;</p><p>T.J. kept it fairly innocent and chaste but the intimate act still gave him tingles and made his heart race. </p><p>&ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo;</p><p>At the voice, Cyrus pulled away with a gasp, causing T.J. to groan in disappointment.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Goodman. Mr. Kippen.&rdquo;</p><p>They both looked up to see the librarian shaking her head and looking disapprovingly at them.</p><p>Oops. They got caught.</p><p>Cyrus was the first to give an apology. &ldquo;Sorry, Mrs. Dabney. We&rsquo;ll go back to studying now.&rdquo;</p><p>The middle-aged woman still looked suspicious but because Cyrus was such a model student, she let it go. Turning around, she walked away to continue her rounds, heeled shoes clicking against the floor.</p><p>T.J. turned back to a red and embarrassed looking Cyrus, whose nose and attention are back to his book. Although, T.J. could tell that his boyfriend was still reeling from the kiss because his eyes weren&rsquo;t even moving to indicate that he was reading.</p><p>Fulfilling his end of the deal, T.J. opened his science book to the chapter he needed.</p><p>A few silent minutes passed. </p><p>T.J.&rsquo;s eyes began to blur.

She sat on the rooftop of the apartments she lived in, watching the golden sun sizzle away and it letting the darkness of the night to take over the sky. Her cheeks we&rsquo;re cold, and there was a slight breeze that made the winter night even colder. But she didn&rsquo;t care, all she cared about was Jonah. He seemed so perfect, like they really did like each other, he was the popular boy who every girl wanted but he dated the art nerd Andi. &ldquo;Of course it was all a dare&rdquo; Andi spoke out loud to herself, her voice cracking every chance it could get, &ldquo;Him and his stupid friends pranking me, I hate them all&rdquo; Her voice get louder but somewhat quieter each time words wondered out her mouth and into the world. &ldquo;Stupid Jonah, Stupid Cyrus, Stupid Buffy, Stupid Amber, all his popular friends are stupid!&rdquo; She shouted it, but it didn&rsquo;t matter, no-one came up to the rooftop, no-one cared about her &ldquo;childish&rdquo; drama&rsquo;s. Her hoodie sleeve was already damp, but she used it again to dry her tears, she knew she was weak, but she didn&rsquo;t know she would cry this much.</p><p>There wasn&rsquo;t much sound, just cars zooming below her and the wind thrashing past the Ariel&rsquo;s. But now there was a new sound, it was heavy and it was behind her, she cringed at the thought of someone seeing her like this but it was certainly footsteps, surrendering she turned her head back only to be met with a unfamiliar figure.</p><p>&ldquo;Mind if I sit?&rdquo;</p><p>His voice was low, it also sounded like he was crying as well, his beanie was obviously shoved on and his clothes were dirty with paint splatters and dust. He seemed to be having a bad day to, so Andi just shrugged and adjusted her gaze back to the cars and lights below them.</p><p>&ldquo;bad day, huh?&rdquo;</p><p>She spoke low, to assure she wasn&rsquo;t trying to intimidate the boy beside her, he puckered his lip and nodded &ldquo;Worst day&rdquo; he responded &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you?&rdquo;</p><p>Andi had nothing to loose, she shouted it out at the top of her lungs, why not tell the cute boy next to her all the horrible things that happened to her today! &ldquo;Boyfriend cheated on me, with my best friend Iris&rdquo; His face dropped even more, feeling sorrow for her &ldquo;Damn I&rsquo;m sorry, that&rsquo;s messed up&rdquo; he sounded genuinely sorry for the crying girl, she nodded with more tears &ldquo;It is&rdquo; she replied more choked up than ever</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Don&rsquo;t cry over him&rdquo; He said, now slinging his arm over her shoulder. She didn&rsquo;t care, it was actually kinda comforting, you know to have someone actually listen to you. &ldquo;He is an idiot, okay? And there&rsquo;s so many people that have been through the same thing you&rsquo;ve been through, and guess what, they moved on and became stronger and happier&rdquo;</p><p>They were basic words, Basic words of comfort, but it still helped. The comfortable silence that followed allowed both of them to look up to the sky, and see non-other than, The Northern Lights. Beautiful blue, turquoise and purple beams across the sky and melting down to the stars. It was beautiful. But it wasn&rsquo;t enough to take Andi&rsquo;s eyes off this boy.</p><p>&ldquo;I like art too by the way&rdquo; Andi spoke, gesturing to his paint marks. &ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s great, cause that means you can help me paint these lights&rdquo; He says with a slightly happier tone. Andi beamed a smile at that at looked back up to the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh and i&rsquo;m Andi by the way&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m walker&rdquo; </p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>that was short :o anyways hope you enjoyed!! xx<br/></p>",
