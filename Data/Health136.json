        "body": "<p>The healthiest way to eat is home cooking, because you know exactly how it\u2019s prepared and what is going in it. \u00a0For this reason, Samir Becic and his Health Fitness Revolution team has put together a list of the healthiest cooking oil to use:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>Extra-Virgin Oil Olive:\u00a0</strong>Rich, slightly peppery-tasting extra-virgin olive oil (which consists mostly of monounsaturated fat) is minimally processed, so it retains extremely high levels of antioxidants, including vitamin E and a compound called oleocanthal. A 2005 study published in the journal Nature found that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties similar to ibuprofen; researchers believe that eating olive oil in moderation may help reduce inflammation in the body over time.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Avocado Oil: \u00a0</strong>Buttery avocado oil is loaded with monounsaturated fat, the kind considered to be heart-healthy because of its powers to improve cholesterol numbers. This fruit oil also supplies lutein, an antioxidant that improves eye health, and studies have determined that the oil can boost salad\u2019s potency by improving the absorption of fat-soluble antioxidants such as beta-carotene present in vegetables.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Hemp Oil: \u00a0</strong>this earthy-tasting oil pressed from hemp seeds abounds in essential fatty acids such as omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid, which studies show reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Hemp oil also delivers gamma linolenic acid, an omega 6 that emerging research says can improve skin health by reducing conditions like roughness and dryness.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Coconut Oil: \u00a0</strong>Perhaps the most misunderstood \u2013 and also one of the healthiest \u2013 oils you can consume. \u00a0Coconut oil is rich in healthy saturated fats and antioxidants, and has been found to promote brain health, boost immunity, and strengthen thyroid function. It\u00a0is an amazingly-versatile, nutrient-dense superfood that is the richest known source of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which aid in the proper digestion and assimilation of fats, as well as boost energy levels.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Red Palm Oil:</strong> Is a cousin to the\u00a0popular tropical coconut oil, this brightly colored oil is laced with antioxidants, including vitamin E and carotenoids such as beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. In the body, beta-carotene can be converted to vitamin A, which is used to promote eye, bone, and immune health. Higher intakes of alpha-carotene, on the other hand,are protective against mortality from heart disease.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Grapeseed Oil:</strong> Is a byproduct of winemaking and has a clean, light flavor and is a good source of both vitamin E and oleic acid, a fat that may help slash stroke risk by up to 73%, according to a recent study in the journal Neurology. Further, scientists have found that oleic acid may curb hunger pangs by being converted into an appetite-quelling hormone.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Sesame Oil:\u00a0</strong>Popular in Asian cooking, sesame oil has a pungent flavor that makes it a favorite in many foods. And the great news is that it is also beneficial to health, having been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. Sesame oil is also rich in iron, calcium, and magnesium, the latter of which is known for its incredible calming effect. Because it is\u00a0rich in polyunsaturated fats, sesame oil helps contribute to cognitive sharpness, proper fat\u00a0absorption, a lowered risk of heart disease, healthy skin, and strong teeth and bones.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Flaxseed Oil\u2028:</strong>\u00a0Flaxseed oil, which comes from the seed of the flax plant, is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat. In fact, it contains more inflammation-reducing omega-3s than fish oil and is one of the few vegetarian sources of the nutrient- this aids with joint pain and can alleviate exercise induced asthma.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Almond Oil:\u00a0</strong>Made by pressing the oil out of ground almond paste, almond oil has a mild nutty flavor and pale yellow hue. It\u2019s plush in monounsaturated fat (like olive and avocado oil), vitamin E, and phytosterols, plant compounds shown to improve cholesterol numbers. Can also be used as a natural skin moisturizer!</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Walnut Oil\u2028:\u00a0</strong>Other than flaxseed oil, walnut oil is one of the few concentrated plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids. A study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that omega-3s in walnuts and walnut oil help reduce cholesterol levels and the body\u2019s biological response to stress. People who have extreme responses to stress are at higher risk for heart disease, so walnut oil can help curb heart disease long term.</li>\n</ul><p>Follow us on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/samirbecic\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/hfrevolution\" target=\"_blank\">facebook</a>\u00a0and visit\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.healthfitnessrevolution.org</a>!</p>\n<br/><a href=\"http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/top-10-healthy-cooking-oils/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">[Read More &hellip;]</a><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/top-10-healthy-cooking-oils/\">http://www.healthfitnessrevolution.com/top-10-healthy-cooking-oils/</a>",

A 2005 study published in the journal Nature found that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties similar to ibuprofen; researchers believe that eating olive oil in moderation may help reduce inflammation in the body over time.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Avocado Oil: \u00a0</strong>Buttery avocado oil is loaded with monounsaturated fat, the kind considered to be heart-healthy because of its powers to improve cholesterol numbers. This fruit oil also supplies lutein, an antioxidant that improves eye health, and studies have determined that the oil can boost salad\u2019s potency by improving the absorption of fat-soluble antioxidants such as beta-carotene present in vegetables.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Hemp Oil: \u00a0</strong>this earthy-tasting oil pressed from hemp seeds abounds in essential fatty acids such as omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid, which studies show reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Hemp oil also delivers gamma linolenic acid, an omega 6 that emerging research says can improve skin health by reducing conditions like roughness and dryness.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Coconut Oil: \u00a0</strong>Perhaps the most misunderstood \u2013 and also one of the healthiest \u2013 oils you can consume. \u00a0Coconut oil is rich in healthy saturated fats and antioxidants, and has been found to promote brain health, boost immunity, and strengthen thyroid function. It\u00a0is an amazingly-versatile, nutrient-dense superfood that is the richest known source of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which aid in the proper digestion and assimilation of fats, as well as boost energy levels.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Red Palm Oil:</strong> Is a cousin to the\u00a0popular tropical coconut oil, this brightly colored oil is laced with antioxidants, including vitamin E and carotenoids such as beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. In the body, beta-carotene can be converted to vitamin A, which is used to promote eye, bone, and immune health. Higher intakes of alpha-carotene, on the other hand,are protective against mortality from heart disease.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Grapeseed Oil:</strong> Is a byproduct of winemaking and has a clean, light flavor and is a good source of both vitamin E and oleic acid, a fat that may help slash stroke risk by up to 73%, according to a recent study in the journal Neurology. Further, scientists have found that oleic acid may curb hunger pangs by being converted into an appetite-quelling hormone.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>\n<strong>Sesame Oil:\u00a0</strong>Popular in Asian cooking, sesame oil has a pungent flavor that makes it a favorite in many foods. And the great news is that it is also beneficial to health, having been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease. Sesame oil is also rich in iron, calcium, and magnesium, the latter of which is known for its incredible calming effect.
