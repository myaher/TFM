                "content": "<p>I won&rsquo;t deny&nbsp;<i>Good Omens </i>is a mass of missed opportunities when it comes to Aziraphale and Crowley interacting with children. Their one fleshed-out scene&nbsp; with Warlock is a disaster, every moment they are with The Them is wasted, and the fact that within the narration they don&rsquo;t think of Warlock once after they realize he is not the anticrhist is one of my top five beefs with the book.</p><p>But disappointing as all that is, it cannot erase the fact that, faced with the probable end of the world, they decide that their best hope is to use their last years to raise a child together&mdash;and they are delighted to do it.</p><p>What really gets to me about the moment they decide to raise Warlock is that they don&rsquo;t even dither over it.
