Not only is Sansa driving the action of the chapter, we also see a change in her behaviour in that she is outwardly resisting Ned and Mordane instead of just being inwardly resentful. She is also expressing her anger that she previously tried to ignore or distract herself from. Most importantly Lady\u2019s death is brought again and we see the trauma this caused in Sansa. She is emotional in an ugly way, argumentative and speaking of violence in a way that unsettles Septa Mordane and doesn\u2019t fit her usual pattern of behaviour. Sansa spends the chapter going from one argument after another, each more serious than other before she leaves the Tower to go to Cersei for help.</p><p>My favourite thing about the chapter is that it follows the previous Sansa chapter in which Joffrey behaves like a prince straight out of a fairytale and Sansa\u2019s resentment towards Cersei turns into empathy after Robert yells at Cersei publicly for making a seemingly harmless suggestion that he shouldn\u2019t get himself hurt. This influences Sansa\u2019s behaviour because it rights the world again to match her world view.\u00a0</p><p>In the beginning of the chapter I got the sense that Sansa was settling into KL despite the initial problems in her life. She was liking her betrothed again (in her romanticism of Joffrey she thinks she loves him because she\u2019s 11) but the cracks are now in Sansa herself rather than the environment.</p>",

Even having been in her service for a while you still possessed the scum from living on the streets. No amount of bathing could truly wash away where you came from.</p><p>Sansa would never return your affections. Not with the way you were.</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;You love her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The newly crowned Queen of Westeros cocks her head coyly.</p><p>Flushing you attempt to push down the stutter that was biting at your tongue. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p><p>Margaery purses her lips in a pretty manner, telling you that she was too smart for you to be playing dumb. You shrink inward, embarrassed at your secret having been so easily found out by Margaery. At your expression she chimes out a laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so shy! It&rsquo;s lovely really. Sansa could use someone like you as a lover.&rdquo;</p><p>You couldn&rsquo;t entertain such things as Sansa being your lover. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve&hellip; You&rsquo;ve got it all wrong! Of course I love my Lady Sansa but not like that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sparkle in your eyes tells me differently.&rdquo;</p><p>Betrayed by your own eyes. You accepted your fate and slumped in your seat where you were keeping Margaery company underneath the vine covered veranda. Originally Sansa had been with the two of you as well but was called away by her husband Tyrion. The stunted lord was nice enough, that was true, but the title as her husband still left a sour note in your mouth. Sansa told you that he never touched her, not even during their bedding. Good, it better stay that way.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; You finally mutter out, your finger absentmindedly tracing the rim of your porcelain teacup. The street part of you thought of how much you could get from selling just one teacup. </p><p>Shaking her head, full, chestnut curls bounce about her shoulders. &ldquo;Love always matters.&rdquo;</p><p>You roll your eyes. &ldquo;Not for people like me. I&rsquo;m from Flea&rsquo;s Bottom. Lowest of the low. I&rsquo;m not meant to be the lover of someone as high born as Sansa. To make things worse&hellip; I&rsquo;m a girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Girls make for better lovers anyway.&rdquo; Margaery hums. &ldquo;I hear they do things differently in Dorne. Girls can court girls, men with men. Doesn&rsquo;t matter. And it shouldn&rsquo;t matter here either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it does.&rdquo; Your throat hitches and for a moment you feared you would get teary eyed. &ldquo;If only I had been born a rich lord.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean Sansa would love you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a better chance to her heart though.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You already have that chance just the way you are. You are closer to her than anyone in the world. I know for a fact that Sansa would do just about anything for you. Now lift your chin and wipe those tears.&nbsp;Things are not always as bad as they seem.&rdquo;</p><p>You try and put on a strong face but inside you still felt utterly the fool.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>TAG LIST:</b></p><p><b>@dorned</b></p></p>",

And while I appreciate the show showing us that she\u2019s taking charge and working hard to take care of the North, I\u2019d <i>also </i>appreciate if they showed her nurturing side on a more intimate scale as well. So\u00a0if they don\u2019t want to waste screen-time on gory post-battle scenes, they could \n\nstill \n\nhave her patch up someone close to her in a more private setting (like Brienne, Jon, Bran, Arya etc) where they have a conversation that\u2019s important for the plot while Sansa works.</p><p>But she doesn\u2019t have to stitch wounds to show that sewing is a good skill to have. People still need clothes. So just something as simple as seeing her sewing on something one evening and then seeing her or another character wearing it in another scene takes care of that.\u00a0It means it\u2019s important to Sansa and also important in general. So if I can be greedy, I\u2019d like a scene like that too.</p><p>(They could even show us a scene of women knitting together and then, in the next scene, show us people bundled up in knitwear and blankets protecting them from the cold to confirm that, yes, knitting is important too.
