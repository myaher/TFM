Its not intentional, not even an afterthought for me. Saturdays are busy in the fall in the my world. There\u2019s college football and the NFL and the World Series and tennis and while my specialty was primarily football and basketball, it was natural for me to follow other things for the blog I ran on the side. Because whether men liked that I was a black women giving them tips on sports, they couldn\u2019t deny that I knew my shit. And I only knew my shit because I spent too \u00a0much of my free time trending things and doing too much research. I never saw Ellie, she came in late Saturday morning\u2026the sun barely rising while I slept. She was nestled in her room when I ran out and I had spent the day in my office, making use of the leftover lunch from the luncheon the day before and watching all the games on big screens while taking notes on my laptop. By the time I got home, Ellie was still perched in her room and I happily trailed into my own, shutting the door and stripping myself of clothes before falling asleep.</p><p>When I wake up the next morning, its from a group text between Ellie and Nel:</p><p><b>N: </b>Bitches. It&rsquo;s been 24 hours since we\u2019ve all been dicked down by an Avenger. Da fuck why haven\u2019t we shared the juicy deets yet?</p><p><b>E:</b> Nel! You don\u2019t expose that stuff over text. Someone can hack it and use it against them</p><p><b>N:</b> Or us</p><p><b>E:</b> Or us!</p><!-- more --><p><b>E:</b> \u2026\u2026but you and Aria might have been the only ones get that Avengers D\u2026.</p><p><b>N:</b> Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t get to experience bucky\u2019s winter soldier?</p><p><b>N: </b>What he freeze up on you? :D</p><p><b>E:</b> Hey! No! We just talked! He was a gentleman</p><p><b>N: </b>Not the way he was giving you the eye</p><p><b>E:</b> It wasn\u2019t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>I saw what I saw and what I saw were fuck me eyes. Do you not agree A?</p><p><b>E:</b> Aria! Tell him Bucky isn\u2019t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>You wanna tell me that Steve wasn\u2019t giving A the full dick down with those baby blues of his. Because he was. All night long\u2026.</p><p><b>E: </b>Aria! Say something</p><p><b>N: </b>She probably worked all day yesterday after the dick down and is resting.</p><p><b>N:</b> So I propose brunch at 11 at Lulu\u2019s.</p><p><b>N:</b> you in?</p><p><b>E:</b>\u2026.ooooo lulu\u2019s! Yep!</p><p><b>N:</b> Perfect. Wake up her highness and I\u2019ll see you bitches in an hour</p><p><b>E: </b>Don\u2019t tell me what to do with my life!</p><p><b>E:</b> \u2026.. see you in a hour ha ha</p><p>I laugh, shaking my head. Nel was the fucking worse in the best way. And then it clicks in my head.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay!?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to say it out loud the thought that shakes me. Sure there was some mild level bi vibes I got from him but hell I just mistook it as his ability to be strongly empathetic. He worked with veterans.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think he was full on gay. I wouldn\u2019t have walked him into Nels arms if I did. Nel was great but the worst kind of heartbreaker.</p><p>\u201cAriadne!\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s voice fills the house and I can hear her door squeal open, shut close. She&rsquo;s in my room in two seconds, a spaghetti strap and shorts that mirror my own and she jumps on my queen size bed and squeals,</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck Steve Rogers!!??? Please, please, please say you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay?\u201d I counter back and she falls back on her haunches, looking at me skeptically,</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s old news. I thought you knew that. I thought that\u2019s why you invited the boys to the bar. So Nel had sam, I would have Bucky to leave you to Steve all for yourself\u2026\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes, sitting up and shaking my head,</p><p>\u201cPure, innocent coincidence. I just wanted wing friends.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and laughs,</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I meant when I said Sam was more Nel\u2019s type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug and she nods, before looking around my room.</p><p>\u201cI know that bomber jacket,\u201d she nods to the blue jacket resting on the back of my desk chair. I look at it, sigh, and throw my head on the back of my headboard. \u201cit belongs to a certain blue eyed soldier. So you did invite him in.\u201d</p><p>I can&rsquo;t help the smile that erupts over my face but I shake my head,</p><p>\u201cE, do you think that if I honestly fucked Steve Rogers I\u2019d be able to walk to work the next day? Really?\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it, furrowing her eyes together then sighs,</p><p>\u201cProbably not. All that super serum dick\u2026.you\u2019d need at least a day of rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He walked me home.\u201d</p><p>She furrow\u2019s her eyebrows together.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me Nel is the one who walked away with a good dicking down out of the three of us?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother fucker.\u201d She says and I giggle as I lean into her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Ms. \u2018 I have Bucky wrapped around my little finger\u2019! I want to hear more about that\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ellie is the kind of girl that loves to share details with the people she loved and I was always the first she would spill too. Unless it was something she was unsure about - something she had to feel out herself.</p><p>Then she\u2019d keep that shit so close to her heart and it\u2019d be up to me to pry it open with crowbar if necessary. </p><p>\u201cHmmmmm\u2026.let&rsquo;s get ready for brunch. Its nearly ten and it&rsquo;s going to take thirty minutes to get down to the island.\u201d</p><p>She was stalling, typical Elli style,</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m going to get it out of you.\u201d I say and she rolls her eyes, smiling as she moves off my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say Ariadne.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cThe gods blessed the earth when they created the man that is Sam Wilson.\u201d</p><p>The caf\u00e9 is packed and were smooshed in a corner because New York decided to dip to the low forties and the idea of waiting outside for an hour felt like hell.</p><p>Nel is being not tactful at all, speaking loudly as he obnoxiously sips his coffee. Despite the scarf he wears, his neck is littered in dark blue and pepper bruises, a gift I\u2019m sure from Sam.</p><p>\u201cYou are being ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\u201d I say, looking up from my phone and he leans down, pushing even closer to me and Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI might be ridiculous but I just had the best goddamn 24 hours of my life. So shoot me for wanting the world to know how happy a certain Avenger made me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I sit up more against the small booth I\u2019m sharing with Ellie. It was pure luck that just when Nel was putting our names in, a couple had gotten up and Ellie and I had rushed to grab the seat. We\u2019d alternate standing with Nel and sitting comfortably \u2013 Lucy\u2019s was always packed and having to stand an hour in even fall chilly temperatures made my knees sore.</p><p>\u201cThis is the happiest I have ever seen you.\u201d Ellie notes from the comfortable place on my shoulder. The tendrils of her hair tickling my exposed neck, and her body warmth was a nice contrast to the cool air that kept creeping into the enclosed space. </p><p>\u201cBecause I am my happiest,\u201d Nel bats his eye lashes before looking down at Ellie, \u201cSo baby doll are you going to lay down some truth about you and Mr. Metal Arm or am I going to have to pull it out of you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie narrows her eyes at him before directing her gaze elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that\u2026\u201d she finally says softly and Nel wiggles his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, why? Did Mr. Barnes fuck you so good you\u2019ve forgotten what it&rsquo;s like to laugh outside of your post orgasmic state?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle as she tries to swat him with her short legs, easily missing Nel who barely moves from the action.</p><p>\u201cStop it Nel! It&rsquo;s not like that with me and him.\u201d her voice is light and I can tell she\u2019s pouting without having to look at her as Nel asks,</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's\u2026.different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d he presses and she sighs, resting her chin on my shoulders and batting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMake him stop.\u201d She whines and I laugh, nudging her forehead with my own before saying,</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019ll listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always listens to you.\u201d she pouts and I shrug,</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026..maybe I\u2019m curious to hear more about your night with Bucky. You both were exuding some mad vibes the minute he sat down next to you.\u201d</p><p>She furrows her eyes together, pouting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, you know that, strategically placing yourself in the middle so we were forced to be all close with them and keeping yourself out of arm&rsquo;s reach from Steve. Speaking of, what did happen with you and Steve? I\u2019m not forgetting that his jacket is still lying on your chair, speaking of.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as Nel leans down, amusement twinkling in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReallly? That\u2019s an interesting unfolding of events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god the both of you. Nothing happened. Really. Steve lectured me on taking the subway home alone, like you both do and then walked me home.\u201d</p><p>I lean back in the booth, allowing the cold air from the window to counter the blood rising to my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Nel asks and I sigh, looking down at Ellie.</p><p>\u201cYou have to give us all the juicy details on Bucky if I go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I will!\u201d my body shakes from the enthusiastic way she bobs her head up and down and I sigh as I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s nothing really. He walked me up the stairs, I kissed him good night on the cheek. Then he asked me for my number and I gave it to him and he hasn\u2019t called me sense.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go into any further detail\u2026.I was feeling insecure about it. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care too much about sharing my number with a boy and not hearing back from him but I thought by now I\u2019d have heard something. On the way over, Ellie had been nose deep in her phone, smiling to herself as she texted who I could only assume was Bucky. Nel had spent the weekend with Sam and I was left pining over someone who probably didn\u2019t like me like that.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s only been like a little over 24 hours\u2026.\u201d Ellie can already sense me falling into myself, how I was placing up walls. For as flirty and outgoing that I could be, I didn\u2019t like the way Steve Grant Rogers made me feel. I was unsure, always second guessing myself. He broke down a lot of fucking walls I\u2019ve spent years mastering putting up.</p><p>But in a sick, tormented way I liked it?</p><p>\u201cNot to mention its Captain America. He\u2019s like one of the most important Avengers\u2026.the big guy. He\u2019s probably just busy saving the world.\u201d</p><p>Nel\u2019s voice is light but it verges on the edge of danger, knowing that my mind was already decided as he flickers his eyes over to Ellie.</p><p>He hoped for all their sake he was right.</p><hr><p>By Tuesday I\u2019m a fucking monster. Between hearing how Ellie had a date with Bucky that night, I wake up in a mean mood, fuming past Ellie in our small shared bathroom and bitching loudly about anything that annoys me. She ignores me, dutiful friend that she is, allowing me to bitch about how cold the water is, sigh exaggeratedly when my charcoal eyeliner breaks against my eye. She\u2019s known me long enough to know how to navigate past a bad mood and her guilt filled irises just fuel my anger.</p><p>Stupid fucking Captain America.</p><p>Everyone I encounter from my trek to my work is a victim to raging eyes that silently read \u201cgo fuck yourself in a dark corner and die\u201d. I nearly lose my shit when a guy spills my $2 coffee on my silk, white blouse and gives an empathetic eye.</p><p>Work is too far away.</p><p>And probably not the brightest idea in my current state.</p><p>The only women on the floor consist of me, the main secretary and three other journalist. There were graphic designers and other behind the scenes staff that were heavier with a female staff, but the main and consistent writers were only full of five fucking women.</p><p>The 21st century hadn\u2019t shifted shit.</p><p>Its enough though, women who know when you\u2019re in a bad mood and instead of digging into why have enough social cues to leave you the fuck alone. Tiffany, the secretary offers me a dress she keeps around and that she\u2019d dry clean my shirt on the company dime which only threatens me to cry. Almost.</p><p>Instead I say thank you, change into the deep V-neck dress, ignoring the fact that it was most definitely designed as a party dress and throw my blazer over it, hoping that my hair covers enough of my cleavage.</p><p>By the time I walk into my first meeting, I\u2019m a little better.</p><p>Just a bit.</p><p>I have to deal with Tod, a mediocre writer who has strings in the right places checking out my boobs every few minutes. Have to tolerate Jeff, an alright guy with a gift for talent but no social cues from showing me his weekend plans. He had managed to get some woman to date him, awkward ass Jeff \u2013 imagine the fuck that \u2013 and I pretend to smile and be \u00a0amused by his story. Stefanie who is sitting across from me can sense my annoyance and throws me a sympathetic glance. I had already texted her my annoyances with the world omitting the Steve Rogers part and she was sympathetic to my struggles. </p><p>I almost make it through my meeting. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>That\u2019s before my boss speeds up a deadline for two articles I haven\u2019t even been able to start because it\u2019s then I\u2019m giving the task of covering some shit Mediocre Tod couldn\u2019t handle. Fuck his rich daddy and his quiet donations to our company. It was killing me.</p><p>I\u2019m on the verge of losing my shit by the time that I walk to my office, tempted between finally giving into my angry, frustrated tears or just destroying my office until I felt satisfied before I \u00a0hear my phone ring.</p><p>Internal - \u00a0great. Probably someone I didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaattt.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound annoyed and clipped but I had so much fucking work to do and on top of it all I forgot to eat breakfast and it was just a little past lunch. I was adding that to my list of annoyances for the day.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft and cracks, it&rsquo;s different. Unlike the young blonde.</p><p>\u201cOk. What do you want me to do about it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Tiffany had worked for my office for a while, so she knew that on bad days my attitude wasn\u2019t anything new. The pause makes me wonder what was up.</p><p>\u201cUmm, maybe\u2026come to meet him? Or I can bring him to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat option. Tell him he has 5 minutes.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and sigh, straightening up. My office had a single window, so there was transparency among young journalist and more experienced writers. Though I was in a corner unit and had a nice space that offered privacy if I need to quick change into an outfit and was too lazy to move to bathroom, it also meant that I couldn\u2019t see who was coming toward me. I open my laptop, connecting it to my desktop screen as I begin outline the two different articles I need to complete. Find a good jazz station and take a deep breath.</p><p>I could pretend to be pleasant for five minutes</p><p>I so caught in breathing exercises I almost miss the light knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cMs. Bellamy,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft as I flicker my eyes over to the door. \u201cYou\u2019re guest is here with lunch.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m five seconds from cussing out whatever new football player thought it would be cute to waltz himself into my office when my heart stops.</p><p>There is no one other than mother fucking Steve Rogers moving into my office.</p><hr><p>Steve had a long weekend. The kind where he was out of the country fighting international bad guys for over 72 hours kind of weekend. It was supposed to be a small intel unit \u2013 him, Rhodey, Natasha. Quick and sweet and he\u2019d be back in his bed as fast as he got out of it.</p><p>Of course it was a fucking trap.</p><p>It had worked out, in the end. They got the information that they needed, had a few individuals in custody. There was no major damage done to any cities and best of all, no need to call for backup. It was a lot of people\u2019s weekend off \u2013 if there was such a thing for protectors of the world \u2013 and he wanted to keep that up. No one in the Tower, himself included, understood boundaries and pushed themselves to hard. Invincible or powerful or sleathy or not, at the core they were all beings and beings had basic needs to survive.</p><p>So they rotated and while the burden had been heavier for him \u2013 taking too many gun shots that would bruise him underneath his suit and a few fractured ribs, he had come back in one piece Monday morning.</p><p>The instant he left the infirmary he had fallen on his bed and didn\u2019t emerge from the deep slumber he was in until Tuesday morning.</p><p>Which was why he hadn\u2019t thought about calling you.</p><p>He compartmentalized things. It was the only way to survive the type of things he saw, the emotional burden he placed on himself. He created distance and boundaries for himself and his personal life \u2013 his personal needs were the last of his areas he paid attention to. It&rsquo;s not until he\u2019s dragging himself into the kitchen, making a pot of coffee that he feels pain against his head.</p><p>He turns quickly and isn\u2019t surprised to see Bucky moving past him, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking idiot.\u201d He mutters to him and Steve frowns, rubbing his head and returning to his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call Ariadne is what.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. Steve\u2019s eyes pop over to Bucky who smirks, shaking his head as he leans against the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call her and now she thinks you don\u2019t like her. And is in a mood and that\u2019s making Ellie nervous to meet up for drinks tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with Ariadne? She wouldn\u2019t tell her to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Bucky nods. \u201cBut Ellie feels terrible her friend is getting ghosted by Captain America so you know, female comradery. Which is fair for their friendship but sucks for the possibility of my relationship. So your idiocy is fucking up my life.\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to forget to call her. I just went out on mission and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t have a fucking smart phone or sense to get texting on that prehistoric machine to let her know,\u201d Bucky cuts him off. \u201cC\u2019mon Steve, I know you well enough to know that\u2019s a poor excuse. What do you think she is going to think?\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs, returning to the coffee pot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess this up. I really want to get to know her. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky finishes, pushing off the counter. \u201cSo I did a little favor. Asked Ellie where Ariadne worked. Asked if she would mind sharing the address so \u00a0my dear friend Steve could go and make amends with lunch.\u201d</p><p>He walks past Steve, placing a piece of paper beside him.</p><p>\u201cFigure out your fucking life and stop forcing me to continue to clean up your mess. And stop being such a pussy when it comes to women you like \u2013 that\u2019s how you lose all the good ones.\u201d</p><p>Bucky shakes his head and Steve can\u2019t help but give a side, grateful smile. Bucky could be a pain in the ass but he knew how to pull through when he really needed it.</p><p>It\u2019s a little past 12:30 when he\u2019s walking through the glass doors of ESPN. He opted for burgers and fries from an upscale restaurant Tony had recommended once because you just seemed like the kind of woman who wasn\u2019t insecure enough to eat a good meal in front of him. He had also grabbed a bouquet of flowers for you \u2013 white roses laced with a fancy form of purple orchid that made him insecure when he stepped out of the elevator from the looks he was receiving. Maybe they were too fancy, possibly, but he didn\u2019t know what type of flowers you liked \u2013 if you were even a flower girl \u2013 and really wanted to make up for the delay in responding back to you. The more he thought about it, the shittier it felt to share a special moment with you and go silent for days.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to \u201cghost\u201d you as Bucky had kindly put it.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t expect when you looked up from your monitor, thick black glasses falling down the bridge of your nose was the overwhelming feeling of lust mixed with relief to fill him. He hadn\u2019t thought he missed you, not really, but seeing you gives him a weird feeling of peace.</p><p>There\u2019s that and the ridiculous cut of the blue dress you wear as you look him up and down before sighing and returning your eyes back to the screen.</p><p>\u201cThanks Tiffany. That\u2019ll be all for now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about the young blonde giving him goo-goo eyes and she flickers back from you to him one last time before stepping out the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cSurprised you even remembered my name to find out where I worked.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a dryness to your tone, your shoulders are tense as you keep your eyes on your monitor.</p><p>Yea \u2013 you were definitely pissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what else to say as you stop moving your fingers for a second and he takes it as his cue to continue, \u201cI had a mission and\u2026this sounds stupid even saying it out loud but I don\u2019t have text and I didn&rsquo;t think to call and leave a message and I sort of&hellip;missions I just am in a different \u00a0mind space. I got back in yesterday and slept and didn\u2019t realize that I had been stupid until then so I thought I\u2019d bring you lunch and flowers. And if that\u2019s too much\u2026I\u2019ll leave. You deserve better than what I put you through.\u201d</p><p>He sees you sigh, closing your eyes and taking intentional breaths before waving to the chair across from you,</p><p>\u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>Its awkward, the first fifteen minutes. You could even give Peggy a run for her money with your ability to not act impressed by the small notions of apology he\u2019s created. But after a few bites into your burger he senses you relaxing, easing into yourself. You don\u2019t pester him about what his mission was like, not like most people who normally are dying to hear about it, instead you ask him what interested him in art. How he was able to refine his skill. In return he asks about how you\u2019ve fallen into journalism, how you ended up at ESPN as a journalist. You speak passionately about your journey, your eyes lighting up and it&rsquo;s only when the both of you are down to your fries that you give a sigh. Not like the one before.</p><p>\u201cI really do need to get back to work. I have two deadlines my boss threw at me this morning and no fucking time to get it done.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re voice is full of regret as you lean back in your chair, your eyes hooded as you swivel your chair back and forth. He nods, smiling as he falls back in his own seat, watching you curiously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I was thinking I was finally getting to the part where I redeem myself.\u201d</p><p>You smile, amused but you don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Just watch him carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you again,\u201d he\u2019s careful with his next words, hunching over and staring at the table. \u201cI know\u2026I didn\u2019t set the best track record the first time. Normally I\u2019m a bit better at this\u2026well not dating.. ahh, I don\u2019t really date a lot but you know, getting to know a woman\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sounded like the world&rsquo;s biggest idiot. One hundred years old and still tripping over his words.</p><p>He flickers his eyes up at you and you\u2019re still watching curiously. He continues,</p><p>\u201cBut I do learn from my mistakes. And I really\u2026.want to get to know you. You are\u2026I like spending time with you. Could I take you out maybe this Friday? Its my weekend off so I promise I won\u2019t be an idiot and accidently blow you off.\u201d</p><p>His voice is hopeful as he looks up at you and you give a lazy grin, pushing your chair back to your laptop and resuming your typing,</p><p>\u201cFriday\u2019s can be hard. Sometimes I work, sometimes I don\u2019t. They\u2019re games you know, and basketball is starting up and the Yankees by some miracle are in the semi-finals. So I\u2019ll probably be going to that,\u201d he got it. He fucked up. It was nice, his gesture, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He was about to get up and apologize for wasting your time before you nod your head thoughtfully, looking over at him, \u201cI normally drag Ellie to these things but she hates it and only goes for the free seats and free booze. And selfie opportunities. But I have nice box seats for the game this Friday \u2013 want to be my plus one?\u201d</p><p>He wants to tell you he\u2019d jump off skyscrapers to be your plus one for the next decade of Yankee games. Instead he gives a coy smile and nods,</p><p>\u201cYea \u2013 that sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d You say as you return your eyes back to your screen. \u201cI\u2019ll call you and tell you the details but I\u2019ll probably meet you there. I\u2019ll be working from home that day and typically have to run here before heading to games so it\u2019ll just be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever works best for you.\u201d he gets up and hesitates, wondering if he should ask to hug you, or just let himself out. When you don\u2019t move your eyes from the screen he takes it as his cue and leaves. He\u2019d won a second date, he wouldn&rsquo;t be pushy about the details.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me walk you out. Sorry, my boss emailed me and I have a bad habit of going into tunnel vision when my interest is peaked.\u201d</p><p>You stand up, shifting your dress, brushing crumbs off your bosom before smiling and walking toward him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, who do I have to thank for sending over the courier lunch service?\u201d</p><p>You move past him with a confident ease, opening your door and strolling out into the office. He\u2019d forgotten how most of the workers had quieted with his appearance and they all fumble back into position as he catches up with you easily.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>You smile, shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cAh. Ellie.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his eyebrows together as you look over at him,</p><p>\u201cNel would have no shame letting Sam know I was in a mood from you ghosting me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as you both make it to the elevator, stuffing his hands in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell are you? Still upset?\u201d he wants it to come off teasing but he knows the worry drips off each word, can\u2019t help but default to bad habits when he was around someone that impressed him. You look up at the ceiling, thinking through it before smiling and shrugging,</p><p>\u201cDepends on how impressed I am by your baseball knowledge.</p><hr><p>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a> @misskenni</b>\n\n</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Tags are still open</b></p>",

Nel was the fucking worse in the best way. And then it clicks in my head.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay!?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to say it out loud the thought that shakes me. Sure there was some mild level bi vibes I got from him but hell I just mistook it as his ability to be strongly empathetic. He worked with veterans.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think he was full on gay. I wouldn\u2019t have walked him into Nels arms if I did. Nel was great but the worst kind of heartbreaker.</p><p>\u201cAriadne!\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s voice fills the house and I can hear her door squeal open, shut close. She\u2019s in my room in two seconds, a spaghetti strap and shorts that mirror my own and she jumps on my queen size bed and squeals,</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck Steve Rogers!!??? Please, please, please say you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay?\u201d I counter back and she falls back on her haunches, looking at me skeptically,</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s old news. I thought you knew that. I thought that\u2019s why you invited the boys to the bar. So Nel had sam, I would have Bucky to leave you to Steve all for yourself\u2026\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes, sitting up and shaking my head,</p><p>\u201cPure, innocent coincidence. I just wanted wing friends.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and laughs,</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I meant when I said Sam was more Nel\u2019s type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug and she nods, before looking around my room.</p><p>\u201cI know that bomber jacket,\u201d she nods to the blue jacket resting on the back of my desk chair. I look at it, sigh, and throw my head on the back of my headboard. \u201cit belongs to a certain blue eyed soldier. So you did invite him in.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile that erupts over my face but I shake my head,</p><p>\u201cE, do you think that if I honestly fucked Steve Rogers I\u2019d be able to walk to work the next day? Really?\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it, furrowing her eyes together then sighs,</p><p>\u201cProbably not. All that super serum dick\u2026.you\u2019d need at least a day of rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He walked me home.\u201d</p><p>She furrow\u2019s her eyebrows together.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me Nel is the one who walked away with a good dicking down out of the three of us?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother fucker.\u201d She says and I giggle as I lean into her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Ms. \u2018 I have Bucky wrapped around my little finger\u2019! I want to hear more about that\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ellie is the kind of girl that loves to share details with the people she loved and I was always the first she would spill too. Unless it was something she was unsure about - something she had to feel out herself.</p><p>Then she\u2019d keep that shit so close to her heart and it\u2019d be up to me to pry it open with crowbar if necessary. </p><p>\u201cHmmmmm\u2026.let\u2019s get ready for brunch. Its nearly ten and it\u2019s going to take thirty minutes to get down to the island.\u201d</p><p>She was stalling, typical Elli style,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get it out of you.\u201d I say and she rolls her eyes, smiling as she moves off my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say Ariadne.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cThe gods blessed the earth when they created the man that is Sam Wilson.\u201d</p><p>The caf\u00e9 is packed and were smooshed in a corner because New York decided to dip to the low forties and the idea of waiting outside for an hour felt like hell.</p><p>Nel is being not tactful at all, speaking loudly as he obnoxiously sips his coffee. Despite the scarf he wears, his neck is littered in dark blue and pepper bruises, a gift I\u2019m sure from Sam.</p><p>\u201cYou are being ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\u201d I say, looking up from my phone and he leans down, pushing even closer to me and Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI might be ridiculous but I just had the best goddamn 24 hours of my life. So shoot me for wanting the world to know how happy a certain Avenger made me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I sit up more against the small booth I\u2019m sharing with Ellie. It was pure luck that just when Nel was putting our names in, a couple had gotten up and Ellie and I had rushed to grab the seat. We\u2019d alternate standing with Nel and sitting comfortably \u2013 Lucy\u2019s was always packed and having to stand an hour in even fall chilly temperatures made my knees sore.</p><p>\u201cThis is the happiest I have ever seen you.\u201d Ellie notes from the comfortable place on my shoulder. The tendrils of her hair tickling my exposed neck, and her body warmth was a nice contrast to the cool air that kept creeping into the enclosed space. </p><p>\u201cBecause I am my happiest,\u201d Nel bats his eye lashes before looking down at Ellie, \u201cSo baby doll are you going to lay down some truth about you and Mr. Metal Arm or am I going to have to pull it out of you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie narrows her eyes at him before directing her gaze elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that\u2026\u201d she finally says softly and Nel wiggles his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, why? Did Mr. Barnes fuck you so good you\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to laugh outside of your post orgasmic state?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle as she tries to swat him with her short legs, easily missing Nel who barely moves from the action.</p><p>\u201cStop it Nel! It\u2019s not like that with me and him.\u201d her voice is light and I can tell she\u2019s pouting without having to look at her as Nel asks,</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's\u2026.different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d he presses and she sighs, resting her chin on my shoulders and batting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMake him stop.\u201d She whines and I laugh, nudging her forehead with my own before saying,</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019ll listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always listens to you.\u201d she pouts and I shrug,</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026..maybe I\u2019m curious to hear more about your night with Bucky. You both were exuding some mad vibes the minute he sat down next to you.\u201d</p><p>She furrows her eyes together, pouting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, you know that, strategically placing yourself in the middle so we were forced to be all close with them and keeping yourself out of arm\u2019s reach from Steve. Speaking of, what did happen with you and Steve? I\u2019m not forgetting that his jacket is still lying on your chair, speaking of.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as Nel leans down, amusement twinkling in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReallly? That\u2019s an interesting unfolding of events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god the both of you. Nothing happened. Really. Steve lectured me on taking the subway home alone, like you both do and then walked me home.\u201d</p><p>I lean back in the booth, allowing the cold air from the window to counter the blood rising to my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Nel asks and I sigh, looking down at Ellie.</p><p>\u201cYou have to give us all the juicy details on Bucky if I go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I will!\u201d my body shakes from the enthusiastic way she bobs her head up and down and I sigh as I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really. He walked me up the stairs, I kissed him good night on the cheek. Then he asked me for my number and I gave it to him and he hasn\u2019t called me sense.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go into any further detail\u2026.I was feeling insecure about it. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care too much about sharing my number with a boy and not hearing back from him but I thought by now I\u2019d have heard something. On the way over, Ellie had been nose deep in her phone, smiling to herself as she texted who I could only assume was Bucky. Nel had spent the weekend with Sam and I was left pining over someone who probably didn\u2019t like me like that.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been like a little over 24 hours\u2026.\u201d Ellie can already sense me falling into myself, how I was placing up walls. For as flirty and outgoing that I could be, I didn\u2019t like the way Steve Grant Rogers made me feel. I was unsure, always second guessing myself. He broke down a lot of fucking walls I\u2019ve spent years mastering putting up.</p><p>But in a sick, tormented way I liked it?</p><p>\u201cNot to mention its Captain America. He\u2019s like one of the most important Avengers\u2026.the big guy. He\u2019s probably just busy saving the world.\u201d</p><p>Nel\u2019s voice is light but it verges on the edge of danger, knowing that my mind was already decided as he flickers his eyes over to Ellie.</p><p>He hoped for all their sake he was right.</p><hr><p>By Tuesday I\u2019m a fucking monster. Between hearing how Ellie had a date with Bucky that night, I wake up in a mean mood, fuming past Ellie in our small shared bathroom and bitching loudly about anything that annoys me. She ignores me, dutiful friend that she is, allowing me to bitch about how cold the water is, sigh exaggeratedly when my charcoal eyeliner breaks against my eye. She\u2019s known me long enough to know how to navigate past a bad mood and her guilt filled irises just fuel my anger.</p><p>Stupid fucking Captain America.</p><p>Everyone I encounter from my trek to my work is a victim to raging eyes that silently read \u201cgo fuck yourself in a dark corner and die\u201d. I nearly lose my shit when a guy spills my $2 coffee on my silk, white blouse and gives an empathetic eye.</p><p>Work is too far away.</p><p>And probably not the brightest idea in my current state.</p><p>The only women on the floor consist of me, the main secretary and three other journalist. There were graphic designers and other behind the scenes staff that were heavier with a female staff, but the main and consistent writers were only full of five fucking women.</p><p>The 21st century hadn\u2019t shifted shit.</p><p>Its enough though, women who know when you\u2019re in a bad mood and instead of digging into why have enough social cues to leave you the fuck alone. Tiffany, the secretary offers me a dress she keeps around and that she\u2019d dry clean my shirt on the company dime which only threatens me to cry. Almost.</p><p>Instead I say thank you, change into the deep V-neck dress, ignoring the fact that it was most definitely designed as a party dress and throw my blazer over it, hoping that my hair covers enough of my cleavage.</p><p>By the time I walk into my first meeting, I\u2019m a little better.</p><p>Just a bit.</p><p>I have to deal with Tod, a mediocre writer who has strings in the right places checking out my boobs every few minutes. Have to tolerate Jeff, an alright guy with a gift for talent but no social cues from showing me his weekend plans. He had managed to get some woman to date him, awkward ass Jeff \u2013 imagine the fuck that \u2013 and I pretend to smile and be \u00a0amused by his story. Stefanie who is sitting across from me can sense my annoyance and throws me a sympathetic glance. I had already texted her my annoyances with the world omitting the Steve Rogers part and she was sympathetic to my struggles. </p><p>I almost make it through my meeting. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>That\u2019s before my boss speeds up a deadline for two articles I haven\u2019t even been able to start because it\u2019s then I\u2019m giving the task of covering some shit Mediocre Tod couldn\u2019t handle. Fuck his rich daddy and his quiet donations to our company. It was killing me.</p><p>I\u2019m on the verge of losing my shit by the time that I walk to my office, tempted between finally giving into my angry, frustrated tears or just destroying my office until I felt satisfied before I \u00a0hear my phone ring.</p><p>Internal - \u00a0great. Probably someone I didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaattt.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound annoyed and clipped but I had so much fucking work to do and on top of it all I forgot to eat breakfast and it was just a little past lunch. I was adding that to my list of annoyances for the day.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft and cracks, it\u2019s different. Unlike the young blonde.</p><p>\u201cOk. What do you want me to do about it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Tiffany had worked for my office for a while, so she knew that on bad days my attitude wasn\u2019t anything new. The pause makes me wonder what was up.</p><p>\u201cUmm, maybe\u2026come to meet him? Or I can bring him to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat option. Tell him he has 5 minutes.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and sigh, straightening up. My office had a single window, so there was transparency among young journalist and more experienced writers. Though I was in a corner unit and had a nice space that offered privacy if I need to quick change into an outfit and was too lazy to move to bathroom, it also meant that I couldn\u2019t see who was coming toward me. I open my laptop, connecting it to my desktop screen as I begin outline the two different articles I need to complete. Find a good jazz station and take a deep breath.</p><p>I could pretend to be pleasant for five minutes</p><p>I so caught in breathing exercises I almost miss the light knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cMs. Bellamy,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft as I flicker my eyes over to the door. \u201cYou\u2019re guest is here with lunch.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m five seconds from cussing out whatever new football player thought it would be cute to waltz himself into my office when my heart stops.</p><p>There is no one other than mother fucking Steve Rogers moving into my office.</p><hr><p>Steve had a long weekend. The kind where he was out of the country fighting international bad guys for over 72 hours kind of weekend. It was supposed to be a small intel unit \u2013 him, Rhodey, Natasha. Quick and sweet and he\u2019d be back in his bed as fast as he got out of it.</p><p>Of course it was a fucking trap.</p><p>It had worked out, in the end. They got the information that they needed, had a few individuals in custody. There was no major damage done to any cities and best of all, no need to call for backup. It was a lot of people\u2019s weekend off \u2013 if there was such a thing for protectors of the world \u2013 and he wanted to keep that up. No one in the Tower, himself included, understood boundaries and pushed themselves to hard. Invincible or powerful or sleathy or not, at the core they were all beings and beings had basic needs to survive.</p><p>So they rotated and while the burden had been heavier for him \u2013 taking too many gun shots that would bruise him underneath his suit and a few fractured ribs, he had come back in one piece Monday morning.</p><p>The instant he left the infirmary he had fallen on his bed and didn\u2019t emerge from the deep slumber he was in until Tuesday morning.</p><p>Which was why he hadn\u2019t thought about calling you.</p><p>He compartmentalized things. It was the only way to survive the type of things he saw, the emotional burden he placed on himself. He created distance and boundaries for himself and his personal life \u2013 his personal needs were the last of his areas he paid attention to. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s dragging himself into the kitchen, making a pot of coffee that he feels pain against his head.</p><p>He turns quickly and isn\u2019t surprised to see Bucky moving past him, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking idiot.\u201d He mutters to him and Steve frowns, rubbing his head and returning to his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call Ariadne is what.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. Steve\u2019s eyes pop over to Bucky who smirks, shaking his head as he leans against the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call her and now she thinks you don\u2019t like her. And is in a mood and that\u2019s making Ellie nervous to meet up for drinks tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with Ariadne? She wouldn\u2019t tell her to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Bucky nods. \u201cBut Ellie feels terrible her friend is getting ghosted by Captain America so you know, female comradery. Which is fair for their friendship but sucks for the possibility of my relationship. So your idiocy is fucking up my life.\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to forget to call her. I just went out on mission and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t have a fucking smart phone or sense to get texting on that prehistoric machine to let her know,\u201d Bucky cuts him off. \u201cC\u2019mon Steve, I know you well enough to know that\u2019s a poor excuse. What do you think she is going to think?\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs, returning to the coffee pot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess this up. I really want to get to know her. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky finishes, pushing off the counter. \u201cSo I did a little favor. Asked Ellie where Ariadne worked. Asked if she would mind sharing the address so \u00a0my dear friend Steve could go and make amends with lunch.\u201d</p><p>He walks past Steve, placing a piece of paper beside him.</p><p>\u201cFigure out your fucking life and stop forcing me to continue to clean up your mess. And stop being such a pussy when it comes to women you like \u2013 that\u2019s how you lose all the good ones.\u201d</p><p>Bucky shakes his head and Steve can\u2019t help but give a side, grateful smile. Bucky could be a pain in the ass but he knew how to pull through when he really needed it.</p><p>It\u2019s a little past 12:30 when he\u2019s walking through the glass doors of ESPN. He opted for burgers and fries from an upscale restaurant Tony had recommended once because you just seemed like the kind of woman who wasn\u2019t insecure enough to eat a good meal in front of him. He had also grabbed a bouquet of flowers for you \u2013 white roses laced with a fancy form of purple orchid that made him insecure when he stepped out of the elevator from the looks he was receiving. Maybe they were too fancy, possibly, but he didn\u2019t know what type of flowers you liked \u2013 if you were even a flower girl \u2013 and really wanted to make up for the delay in responding back to you. The more he thought about it, the shittier it felt to share a special moment with you and go silent for days.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to \u201cghost\u201d you as Bucky had kindly put it.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t expect when you looked up from your monitor, thick black glasses falling down the bridge of your nose was the overwhelming feeling of lust mixed with relief to fill him. He hadn\u2019t thought he missed you, not really, but seeing you gives him a weird feeling of peace.</p><p>There\u2019s that and the ridiculous cut of the blue dress you wear as you look him up and down before sighing and returning your eyes back to the screen.</p><p>\u201cThanks Tiffany. That\u2019ll be all for now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about the young blonde giving him goo-goo eyes and she flickers back from you to him one last time before stepping out the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cSurprised you even remembered my name to find out where I worked.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a dryness to your tone, your shoulders are tense as you keep your eyes on your monitor.</p><p>Yea \u2013 you were definitely pissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what else to say as you stop moving your fingers for a second and he takes it as his cue to continue, \u201cI had a mission and\u2026this sounds stupid even saying it out loud but I don\u2019t have text and I didn\u2019t think to call and leave a message and I sort of\u2026missions I just am in a different \u00a0mind space. I got back in yesterday and slept and didn\u2019t realize that I had been stupid until then so I thought I\u2019d bring you lunch and flowers. And if that\u2019s too much\u2026I\u2019ll leave. You deserve better than what I put you through.\u201d</p><p>He sees you sigh, closing your eyes and taking intentional breaths before waving to the chair across from you,</p><p>\u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>Its awkward, the first fifteen minutes. You could even give Peggy a run for her money with your ability to not act impressed by the small notions of apology he\u2019s created. But after a few bites into your burger he senses you relaxing, easing into yourself. You don\u2019t pester him about what his mission was like, not like most people who normally are dying to hear about it, instead you ask him what interested him in art. How he was able to refine his skill. In return he asks about how you\u2019ve fallen into journalism, how you ended up at ESPN as a journalist. You speak passionately about your journey, your eyes lighting up and it\u2019s only when the both of you are down to your fries that you give a sigh. Not like the one before.</p><p>\u201cI really do need to get back to work. I have two deadlines my boss threw at me this morning and no fucking time to get it done.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re voice is full of regret as you lean back in your chair, your eyes hooded as you swivel your chair back and forth. He nods, smiling as he falls back in his own seat, watching you curiously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I was thinking I was finally getting to the part where I redeem myself.\u201d</p><p>You smile, amused but you don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Just watch him carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you again,\u201d he\u2019s careful with his next words, hunching over and staring at the table. \u201cI know\u2026I didn\u2019t set the best track record the first time. Normally I\u2019m a bit better at this\u2026well not dating.. ahh, I don\u2019t really date a lot but you know, getting to know a woman\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sounded like the world\u2019s biggest idiot. One hundred years old and still tripping over his words.</p><p>He flickers his eyes up at you and you\u2019re still watching curiously. He continues,</p><p>\u201cBut I do learn from my mistakes. And I really\u2026.want to get to know you. You are\u2026I like spending time with you. Could I take you out maybe this Friday? Its my weekend off so I promise I won\u2019t be an idiot and accidently blow you off.\u201d</p><p>His voice is hopeful as he looks up at you and you give a lazy grin, pushing your chair back to your laptop and resuming your typing,</p><p>\u201cFriday\u2019s can be hard. Sometimes I work, sometimes I don\u2019t. They\u2019re games you know, and basketball is starting up and the Yankees by some miracle are in the semi-finals. So I\u2019ll probably be going to that,\u201d he got it. He fucked up. It was nice, his gesture, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He was about to get up and apologize for wasting your time before you nod your head thoughtfully, looking over at him, \u201cI normally drag Ellie to these things but she hates it and only goes for the free seats and free booze. And selfie opportunities. But I have nice box seats for the game this Friday \u2013 want to be my plus one?\u201d</p><p>He wants to tell you he\u2019d jump off skyscrapers to be your plus one for the next decade of Yankee games. Instead he gives a coy smile and nods,</p><p>\u201cYea \u2013 that sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d You say as you return your eyes back to your screen. \u201cI\u2019ll call you and tell you the details but I\u2019ll probably meet you there. I\u2019ll be working from home that day and typically have to run here before heading to games so it\u2019ll just be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever works best for you.\u201d he gets up and hesitates, wondering if he should ask to hug you, or just let himself out. When you don\u2019t move your eyes from the screen he takes it as his cue and leaves. He\u2019d won a second date, he wouldn\u2019t be pushy about the details.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me walk you out. Sorry, my boss emailed me and I have a bad habit of going into tunnel vision when my interest is peaked.\u201d</p><p>You stand up, shifting your dress, brushing crumbs off your bosom before smiling and walking toward him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, who do I have to thank for sending over the courier lunch service?\u201d</p><p>You move past him with a confident ease, opening your door and strolling out into the office. He\u2019d forgotten how most of the workers had quieted with his appearance and they all fumble back into position as he catches up with you easily.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>You smile, shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cAh. Ellie.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his eyebrows together as you look over at him,</p><p>\u201cNel would have no shame letting Sam know I was in a mood from you ghosting me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as you both make it to the elevator, stuffing his hands in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell are you? Still upset?\u201d he wants it to come off teasing but he knows the worry drips off each word, can\u2019t help but default to bad habits when he was around someone that impressed him. You look up at the ceiling, thinking through it before smiling and shrugging,</p><p>\u201cDepends on how impressed I am by your baseball knowledge.</p><hr><p>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a> @misskenni</b>\n\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Tags are still open</b></p></p>",

Its not intentional, not even an afterthought for me. Saturdays are busy in the fall in the my world. There\u2019s college football and the NFL and the World Series and tennis and while my specialty was primarily football and basketball, it was natural for me to follow other things for the blog I ran on the side. Because whether men liked that I was a black women giving them tips on sports, they couldn\u2019t deny that I knew my shit. And I only knew my shit because I spent too \u00a0much of my free time trending things and doing too much research. I never saw Ellie, she came in late Saturday morning\u2026the sun barely rising while I slept. She was nestled in her room when I ran out and I had spent the day in my office, making use of the leftover lunch from the luncheon the day before and watching all the games on big screens while taking notes on my laptop. By the time I got home, Ellie was still perched in her room and I happily trailed into my own, shutting the door and stripping myself of clothes before falling asleep.</p><p>When I wake up the next morning, its from a group text between Ellie and Nel:</p><p><b>N: </b>Bitches. It\u2019s been 24 hours since we\u2019ve all been dicked down by an Avenger. Da fuck why haven\u2019t we shared the juicy deets yet?</p><p><b>E:</b> Nel! You don\u2019t expose that stuff over text. Someone can hack it and use it against them</p><p><b>N:</b> Or us</p><p><b>E:</b> Or us!</p>[[MORE]]<p><b>E:</b> \u2026\u2026but you and Aria might have been the only ones get that Avengers D\u2026.</p><p><b>N:</b> Don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t get to experience bucky\u2019s winter soldier?</p><p><b>N: </b>What he freeze up on you? :D</p><p><b>E:</b> Hey! No! We just talked! He was a gentleman</p><p><b>N: </b>Not the way he was giving you the eye</p><p><b>E:</b> It wasn\u2019t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>I saw what I saw and what I saw were fuck me eyes. Do you not agree A?</p><p><b>E:</b> Aria! Tell him Bucky isn\u2019t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>You wanna tell me that Steve wasn\u2019t giving A the full dick down with those baby blues of his. Because he was. All night long\u2026.</p><p><b>E: </b>Aria! Say something</p><p><b>N: </b>She probably worked all day yesterday after the dick down and is resting.</p><p><b>N:</b> So I propose brunch at 11 at Lulu\u2019s.</p><p><b>N:</b> you in?</p><p><b>E:</b>\u2026.ooooo lulu\u2019s! Yep!</p><p><b>N:</b> Perfect. Wake up her highness and I\u2019ll see you bitches in an hour</p><p><b>E: </b>Don\u2019t tell me what to do with my life!</p><p><b>E:</b> \u2026.. see you in a hour ha ha</p><p>I laugh, shaking my head. Nel was the fucking worse in the best way. And then it clicks in my head.</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay!?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to say it out loud the thought that shakes me. Sure there was some mild level bi vibes I got from him but hell I just mistook it as his ability to be strongly empathetic. He worked with veterans.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think he was full on gay. I wouldn\u2019t have walked him into Nels arms if I did. Nel was great but the worst kind of heartbreaker.</p><p>\u201cAriadne!\u201d</p><p>Ellie\u2019s voice fills the house and I can hear her door squeal open, shut close. She\u2019s in my room in two seconds, a spaghetti strap and shorts that mirror my own and she jumps on my queen size bed and squeals,</p><p>\u201cDid you fuck Steve Rogers!!??? Please, please, please say you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s gay?\u201d I counter back and she falls back on her haunches, looking at me skeptically,</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s old news. I thought you knew that. I thought that\u2019s why you invited the boys to the bar. So Nel had sam, I would have Bucky to leave you to Steve all for yourself\u2026\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes, sitting up and shaking my head,</p><p>\u201cPure, innocent coincidence. I just wanted wing friends.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and laughs,</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think I meant when I said Sam was more Nel\u2019s type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug and she nods, before looking around my room.</p><p>\u201cI know that bomber jacket,\u201d she nods to the blue jacket resting on the back of my desk chair. I look at it, sigh, and throw my head on the back of my headboard. \u201cit belongs to a certain blue eyed soldier. So you did invite him in.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile that erupts over my face but I shake my head,</p><p>\u201cE, do you think that if I honestly fucked Steve Rogers I\u2019d be able to walk to work the next day? Really?\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it, furrowing her eyes together then sighs,</p><p>\u201cProbably not. All that super serum dick\u2026.you\u2019d need at least a day of rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He walked me home.\u201d</p><p>She furrow\u2019s her eyebrows together.</p><p>\u201cYou telling me Nel is the one who walked away with a good dicking down out of the three of us?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother fucker.\u201d She says and I giggle as I lean into her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever Ms. \u2018 I have Bucky wrapped around my little finger\u2019! I want to hear more about that\u2026\u201d</p><p>Ellie is the kind of girl that loves to share details with the people she loved and I was always the first she would spill too. Unless it was something she was unsure about - something she had to feel out herself.</p><p>Then she\u2019d keep that shit so close to her heart and it\u2019d be up to me to pry it open with crowbar if necessary. </p><p>\u201cHmmmmm\u2026.let\u2019s get ready for brunch. Its nearly ten and it\u2019s going to take thirty minutes to get down to the island.\u201d</p><p>She was stalling, typical Elli style,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get it out of you.\u201d I say and she rolls her eyes, smiling as she moves off my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say Ariadne.\u201d</p><hr><p>\u201cThe gods blessed the earth when they created the man that is Sam Wilson.\u201d</p><p>The caf\u00e9 is packed and were smooshed in a corner because New York decided to dip to the low forties and the idea of waiting outside for an hour felt like hell.</p><p>Nel is being not tactful at all, speaking loudly as he obnoxiously sips his coffee. Despite the scarf he wears, his neck is littered in dark blue and pepper bruises, a gift I\u2019m sure from Sam.</p><p>\u201cYou are being ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\u201d I say, looking up from my phone and he leans down, pushing even closer to me and Ellie.</p><p>\u201cI might be ridiculous but I just had the best goddamn 24 hours of my life. So shoot me for wanting the world to know how happy a certain Avenger made me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I sit up more against the small booth I\u2019m sharing with Ellie. It was pure luck that just when Nel was putting our names in, a couple had gotten up and Ellie and I had rushed to grab the seat. We\u2019d alternate standing with Nel and sitting comfortably \u2013 Lucy\u2019s was always packed and having to stand an hour in even fall chilly temperatures made my knees sore.</p><p>\u201cThis is the happiest I have ever seen you.\u201d Ellie notes from the comfortable place on my shoulder. The tendrils of her hair tickling my exposed neck, and her body warmth was a nice contrast to the cool air that kept creeping into the enclosed space. </p><p>\u201cBecause I am my happiest,\u201d Nel bats his eye lashes before looking down at Ellie, \u201cSo baby doll are you going to lay down some truth about you and Mr. Metal Arm or am I going to have to pull it out of you.\u201d</p><p>Ellie narrows her eyes at him before directing her gaze elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that\u2026\u201d she finally says softly and Nel wiggles his eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, why? Did Mr. Barnes fuck you so good you\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to laugh outside of your post orgasmic state?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle as she tries to swat him with her short legs, easily missing Nel who barely moves from the action.</p><p>\u201cStop it Nel! It\u2019s not like that with me and him.\u201d her voice is light and I can tell she\u2019s pouting without having to look at her as Nel asks,</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt's\u2026.different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d he presses and she sighs, resting her chin on my shoulders and batting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMake him stop.\u201d She whines and I laugh, nudging her forehead with my own before saying,</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019ll listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always listens to you.\u201d she pouts and I shrug,</p><p>\u201cWell\u2026..maybe I\u2019m curious to hear more about your night with Bucky. You both were exuding some mad vibes the minute he sat down next to you.\u201d</p><p>She furrows her eyes together, pouting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, you know that, strategically placing yourself in the middle so we were forced to be all close with them and keeping yourself out of arm\u2019s reach from Steve. Speaking of, what did happen with you and Steve? I\u2019m not forgetting that his jacket is still lying on your chair, speaking of.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as Nel leans down, amusement twinkling in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cReallly? That\u2019s an interesting unfolding of events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god the both of you. Nothing happened. Really. Steve lectured me on taking the subway home alone, like you both do and then walked me home.\u201d</p><p>I lean back in the booth, allowing the cold air from the window to counter the blood rising to my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnd then\u2026\u201d Nel asks and I sigh, looking down at Ellie.</p><p>\u201cYou have to give us all the juicy details on Bucky if I go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I will!\u201d my body shakes from the enthusiastic way she bobs her head up and down and I sigh as I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really. He walked me up the stairs, I kissed him good night on the cheek. Then he asked me for my number and I gave it to him and he hasn\u2019t called me sense.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go into any further detail\u2026.I was feeling insecure about it. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care too much about sharing my number with a boy and not hearing back from him but I thought by now I\u2019d have heard something. On the way over, Ellie had been nose deep in her phone, smiling to herself as she texted who I could only assume was Bucky. Nel had spent the weekend with Sam and I was left pining over someone who probably didn\u2019t like me like that.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been like a little over 24 hours\u2026.\u201d Ellie can already sense me falling into myself, how I was placing up walls. For as flirty and outgoing that I could be, I didn\u2019t like the way Steve Grant Rogers made me feel. I was unsure, always second guessing myself. He broke down a lot of fucking walls I\u2019ve spent years mastering putting up.</p><p>But in a sick, tormented way I liked it?</p><p>\u201cNot to mention its Captain America. He\u2019s like one of the most important Avengers\u2026.the big guy. He\u2019s probably just busy saving the world.\u201d</p><p>Nel\u2019s voice is light but it verges on the edge of danger, knowing that my mind was already decided as he flickers his eyes over to Ellie.</p><p>He hoped for all their sake he was right.</p><hr><p>By Tuesday I\u2019m a fucking monster. Between hearing how Ellie had a date with Bucky that night, I wake up in a mean mood, fuming past Ellie in our small shared bathroom and bitching loudly about anything that annoys me. She ignores me, dutiful friend that she is, allowing me to bitch about how cold the water is, sigh exaggeratedly when my charcoal eyeliner breaks against my eye. She\u2019s known me long enough to know how to navigate past a bad mood and her guilt filled irises just fuel my anger.</p><p>Stupid fucking Captain America.</p><p>Everyone I encounter from my trek to my work is a victim to raging eyes that silently read \u201cgo fuck yourself in a dark corner and die\u201d. I nearly lose my shit when a guy spills my $2 coffee on my silk, white blouse and gives an empathetic eye.</p><p>Work is too far away.</p><p>And probably not the brightest idea in my current state.</p><p>The only women on the floor consist of me, the main secretary and three other journalist. There were graphic designers and other behind the scenes staff that were heavier with a female staff, but the main and consistent writers were only full of five fucking women.</p><p>The 21st century hadn\u2019t shifted shit.</p><p>Its enough though, women who know when you\u2019re in a bad mood and instead of digging into why have enough social cues to leave you the fuck alone. Tiffany, the secretary offers me a dress she keeps around and that she\u2019d dry clean my shirt on the company dime which only threatens me to cry. Almost.</p><p>Instead I say thank you, change into the deep V-neck dress, ignoring the fact that it was most definitely designed as a party dress and throw my blazer over it, hoping that my hair covers enough of my cleavage.</p><p>By the time I walk into my first meeting, I\u2019m a little better.</p><p>Just a bit.</p><p>I have to deal with Tod, a mediocre writer who has strings in the right places checking out my boobs every few minutes. Have to tolerate Jeff, an alright guy with a gift for talent but no social cues from showing me his weekend plans. He had managed to get some woman to date him, awkward ass Jeff \u2013 imagine the fuck that \u2013 and I pretend to smile and be \u00a0amused by his story. Stefanie who is sitting across from me can sense my annoyance and throws me a sympathetic glance. I had already texted her my annoyances with the world omitting the Steve Rogers part and she was sympathetic to my struggles. </p><p>I almost make it through my meeting. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>That\u2019s before my boss speeds up a deadline for two articles I haven\u2019t even been able to start because it\u2019s then I\u2019m giving the task of covering some shit Mediocre Tod couldn\u2019t handle. Fuck his rich daddy and his quiet donations to our company. It was killing me.</p><p>I\u2019m on the verge of losing my shit by the time that I walk to my office, tempted between finally giving into my angry, frustrated tears or just destroying my office until I felt satisfied before I \u00a0hear my phone ring.</p><p>Internal - \u00a0great. Probably someone I didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaattt.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound annoyed and clipped but I had so much fucking work to do and on top of it all I forgot to eat breakfast and it was just a little past lunch. I was adding that to my list of annoyances for the day.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor Ms. Bellamy.\u201d</p><p>Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft and cracks, it\u2019s different. Unlike the young blonde.</p><p>\u201cOk. What do you want me to do about it?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Tiffany had worked for my office for a while, so she knew that on bad days my attitude wasn\u2019t anything new. The pause makes me wonder what was up.</p><p>\u201cUmm, maybe\u2026come to meet him? Or I can bring him to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat option. Tell him he has 5 minutes.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and sigh, straightening up. My office had a single window, so there was transparency among young journalist and more experienced writers. Though I was in a corner unit and had a nice space that offered privacy if I need to quick change into an outfit and was too lazy to move to bathroom, it also meant that I couldn\u2019t see who was coming toward me. I open my laptop, connecting it to my desktop screen as I begin outline the two different articles I need to complete. Find a good jazz station and take a deep breath.</p><p>I could pretend to be pleasant for five minutes</p><p>I so caught in breathing exercises I almost miss the light knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cMs. Bellamy,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s voice is soft as I flicker my eyes over to the door. \u201cYou\u2019re guest is here with lunch.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m five seconds from cussing out whatever new football player thought it would be cute to waltz himself into my office when my heart stops.</p><p>There is no one other than mother fucking Steve Rogers moving into my office.</p><hr><p>Steve had a long weekend. The kind where he was out of the country fighting international bad guys for over 72 hours kind of weekend. It was supposed to be a small intel unit \u2013 him, Rhodey, Natasha. Quick and sweet and he\u2019d be back in his bed as fast as he got out of it.</p><p>Of course it was a fucking trap.</p><p>It had worked out, in the end. They got the information that they needed, had a few individuals in custody. There was no major damage done to any cities and best of all, no need to call for backup. It was a lot of people\u2019s weekend off \u2013 if there was such a thing for protectors of the world \u2013 and he wanted to keep that up. No one in the Tower, himself included, understood boundaries and pushed themselves to hard. Invincible or powerful or sleathy or not, at the core they were all beings and beings had basic needs to survive.</p><p>So they rotated and while the burden had been heavier for him \u2013 taking too many gun shots that would bruise him underneath his suit and a few fractured ribs, he had come back in one piece Monday morning.</p><p>The instant he left the infirmary he had fallen on his bed and didn\u2019t emerge from the deep slumber he was in until Tuesday morning.</p><p>Which was why he hadn\u2019t thought about calling you.</p><p>He compartmentalized things. It was the only way to survive the type of things he saw, the emotional burden he placed on himself. He created distance and boundaries for himself and his personal life \u2013 his personal needs were the last of his areas he paid attention to. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s dragging himself into the kitchen, making a pot of coffee that he feels pain against his head.</p><p>He turns quickly and isn\u2019t surprised to see Bucky moving past him, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking idiot.\u201d He mutters to him and Steve frowns, rubbing his head and returning to his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call Ariadne is what.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch. Steve\u2019s eyes pop over to Bucky who smirks, shaking his head as he leans against the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call her and now she thinks you don\u2019t like her. And is in a mood and that\u2019s making Ellie nervous to meet up for drinks tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with Ariadne? She wouldn\u2019t tell her to stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Bucky nods. \u201cBut Ellie feels terrible her friend is getting ghosted by Captain America so you know, female comradery. Which is fair for their friendship but sucks for the possibility of my relationship. So your idiocy is fucking up my life.\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to forget to call her. I just went out on mission and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t have a fucking smart phone or sense to get texting on that prehistoric machine to let her know,\u201d Bucky cuts him off. \u201cC\u2019mon Steve, I know you well enough to know that\u2019s a poor excuse. What do you think she is going to think?\u201d</p><p>Steve sighs, returning to the coffee pot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess this up. I really want to get to know her. I\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky finishes, pushing off the counter. \u201cSo I did a little favor. Asked Ellie where Ariadne worked. Asked if she would mind sharing the address so \u00a0my dear friend Steve could go and make amends with lunch.\u201d</p><p>He walks past Steve, placing a piece of paper beside him.</p><p>\u201cFigure out your fucking life and stop forcing me to continue to clean up your mess. And stop being such a pussy when it comes to women you like \u2013 that\u2019s how you lose all the good ones.\u201d</p><p>Bucky shakes his head and Steve can\u2019t help but give a side, grateful smile. Bucky could be a pain in the ass but he knew how to pull through when he really needed it.</p><p>It\u2019s a little past 12:30 when he\u2019s walking through the glass doors of ESPN. He opted for burgers and fries from an upscale restaurant Tony had recommended once because you just seemed like the kind of woman who wasn\u2019t insecure enough to eat a good meal in front of him. He had also grabbed a bouquet of flowers for you \u2013 white roses laced with a fancy form of purple orchid that made him insecure when he stepped out of the elevator from the looks he was receiving. Maybe they were too fancy, possibly, but he didn\u2019t know what type of flowers you liked \u2013 if you were even a flower girl \u2013 and really wanted to make up for the delay in responding back to you. The more he thought about it, the shittier it felt to share a special moment with you and go silent for days.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mean to \u201cghost\u201d you as Bucky had kindly put it.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t expect when you looked up from your monitor, thick black glasses falling down the bridge of your nose was the overwhelming feeling of lust mixed with relief to fill him. He hadn\u2019t thought he missed you, not really, but seeing you gives him a weird feeling of peace.</p><p>There\u2019s that and the ridiculous cut of the blue dress you wear as you look him up and down before sighing and returning your eyes back to the screen.</p><p>\u201cThanks Tiffany. That\u2019ll be all for now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about the young blonde giving him goo-goo eyes and she flickers back from you to him one last time before stepping out the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cSurprised you even remembered my name to find out where I worked.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a dryness to your tone, your shoulders are tense as you keep your eyes on your monitor.</p><p>Yea \u2013 you were definitely pissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what else to say as you stop moving your fingers for a second and he takes it as his cue to continue, \u201cI had a mission and\u2026this sounds stupid even saying it out loud but I don\u2019t have text and I didn\u2019t think to call and leave a message and I sort of\u2026missions I just am in a different \u00a0mind space. I got back in yesterday and slept and didn\u2019t realize that I had been stupid until then so I thought I\u2019d bring you lunch and flowers. And if that\u2019s too much\u2026I\u2019ll leave. You deserve better than what I put you through.\u201d</p><p>He sees you sigh, closing your eyes and taking intentional breaths before waving to the chair across from you,</p><p>\u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>Its awkward, the first fifteen minutes. You could even give Peggy a run for her money with your ability to not act impressed by the small notions of apology he\u2019s created. But after a few bites into your burger he senses you relaxing, easing into yourself. You don\u2019t pester him about what his mission was like, not like most people who normally are dying to hear about it, instead you ask him what interested him in art. How he was able to refine his skill. In return he asks about how you\u2019ve fallen into journalism, how you ended up at ESPN as a journalist. You speak passionately about your journey, your eyes lighting up and it\u2019s only when the both of you are down to your fries that you give a sigh. Not like the one before.</p><p>\u201cI really do need to get back to work. I have two deadlines my boss threw at me this morning and no fucking time to get it done.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re voice is full of regret as you lean back in your chair, your eyes hooded as you swivel your chair back and forth. He nods, smiling as he falls back in his own seat, watching you curiously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I was thinking I was finally getting to the part where I redeem myself.\u201d</p><p>You smile, amused but you don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Just watch him carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see you again,\u201d he\u2019s careful with his next words, hunching over and staring at the table. \u201cI know\u2026I didn\u2019t set the best track record the first time. Normally I\u2019m a bit better at this\u2026well not dating.. ahh, I don\u2019t really date a lot but you know, getting to know a woman\u2026\u201d</p><p>He sounded like the world\u2019s biggest idiot. One hundred years old and still tripping over his words.</p><p>He flickers his eyes up at you and you\u2019re still watching curiously. He continues,</p><p>\u201cBut I do learn from my mistakes. And I really\u2026.want to get to know you. You are\u2026I like spending time with you. Could I take you out maybe this Friday? Its my weekend off so I promise I won\u2019t be an idiot and accidently blow you off.\u201d</p><p>His voice is hopeful as he looks up at you and you give a lazy grin, pushing your chair back to your laptop and resuming your typing,</p><p>\u201cFriday\u2019s can be hard. Sometimes I work, sometimes I don\u2019t. They\u2019re games you know, and basketball is starting up and the Yankees by some miracle are in the semi-finals. So I\u2019ll probably be going to that,\u201d he got it. He fucked up. It was nice, his gesture, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He was about to get up and apologize for wasting your time before you nod your head thoughtfully, looking over at him, \u201cI normally drag Ellie to these things but she hates it and only goes for the free seats and free booze. And selfie opportunities. But I have nice box seats for the game this Friday \u2013 want to be my plus one?\u201d</p><p>He wants to tell you he\u2019d jump off skyscrapers to be your plus one for the next decade of Yankee games. Instead he gives a coy smile and nods,</p><p>\u201cYea \u2013 that sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d You say as you return your eyes back to your screen. \u201cI\u2019ll call you and tell you the details but I\u2019ll probably meet you there. I\u2019ll be working from home that day and typically have to run here before heading to games so it\u2019ll just be easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever works best for you.\u201d he gets up and hesitates, wondering if he should ask to hug you, or just let himself out. When you don\u2019t move your eyes from the screen he takes it as his cue and leaves. He\u2019d won a second date, he wouldn\u2019t be pushy about the details.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me walk you out. Sorry, my boss emailed me and I have a bad habit of going into tunnel vision when my interest is peaked.\u201d</p><p>You stand up, shifting your dress, brushing crumbs off your bosom before smiling and walking toward him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, who do I have to thank for sending over the courier lunch service?\u201d</p><p>You move past him with a confident ease, opening your door and strolling out into the office. He\u2019d forgotten how most of the workers had quieted with his appearance and they all fumble back into position as he catches up with you easily.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>You smile, shaking your head.</p><p>\u201cAh. Ellie.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his eyebrows together as you look over at him,</p><p>\u201cNel would have no shame letting Sam know I was in a mood from you ghosting me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles as you both make it to the elevator, stuffing his hands in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell are you? Still upset?\u201d he wants it to come off teasing but he knows the worry drips off each word, can\u2019t help but default to bad habits when he was around someone that impressed him. You look up at the ceiling, thinking through it before smiling and shrugging,</p><p>\u201cDepends on how impressed I am by your baseball knowledge.</p><hr><p>Tag List:\u00a0\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a> @misskenni</b>\n\n</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Tags are still open</b></p></p>",

Its not intentional, not even an afterthought for me. Saturdays are busy in the fall in the my world. There&rsquo;s college football and the NFL and the World Series and tennis and while my specialty was primarily football and basketball, it was natural for me to follow other things for the blog I ran on the side. Because whether men liked that I was a black women giving them tips on sports, they couldn&rsquo;t deny that I knew my shit. And I only knew my shit because I spent too &nbsp;much of my free time trending things and doing too much research. I never saw Ellie, she came in late Saturday morning&hellip;the sun barely rising while I slept. She was nestled in her room when I ran out and I had spent the day in my office, making use of the leftover lunch from the luncheon the day before and watching all the games on big screens while taking notes on my laptop. By the time I got home, Ellie was still perched in her room and I happily trailed into my own, shutting the door and stripping myself of clothes before falling asleep.</p><p>When I wake up the next morning, its from a group text between Ellie and Nel:</p><p><b>N: </b>Bitches. It&rsquo;s been 24 hours since we&rsquo;ve all been dicked down by an Avenger. Da fuck why haven&rsquo;t we shared the juicy deets yet?</p><p><b>E:</b> Nel! You don&rsquo;t expose that stuff over text. Someone can hack it and use it against them</p><p><b>N:</b> Or us</p><p><b>E:</b> Or us!</p><p><b>E:</b> &hellip;&hellip;but you and Aria might have been the only ones get that Avengers D&hellip;.</p><p><b>N:</b> Don&rsquo;t tell me you didn&rsquo;t get to experience bucky&rsquo;s winter soldier?</p><p><b>N: </b>What he freeze up on you? :D</p><p><b>E:</b> Hey! No! We just talked! He was a gentleman</p><p><b>N: </b>Not the way he was giving you the eye</p><p><b>E:</b> It wasn&rsquo;t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>I saw what I saw and what I saw were fuck me eyes. Do you not agree A?</p><p><b>E:</b> Aria! Tell him Bucky isn&rsquo;t like that</p><p><b>N: </b>You wanna tell me that Steve wasn&rsquo;t giving A the full dick down with those baby blues of his. Because he was. All night long&hellip;.</p><p><b>E: </b>Aria! Say something</p><p><b>N: </b>She probably worked all day yesterday after the dick down and is resting.</p><p><b>N:</b> So I propose brunch at 11 at Lulu&rsquo;s.</p><p><b>N:</b> you in?</p><p><b>E:</b>&hellip;.ooooo lulu&rsquo;s! Yep!</p><p><b>N:</b> Perfect. Wake up her highness and I&rsquo;ll see you bitches in an hour</p><p><b>E: </b>Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do with my life!</p><p><b>E:</b> &hellip;.. see you in a hour ha ha</p><p>I laugh, shaking my head. Nel was the fucking worse in the best way. And then it clicks in my head.</p><p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s gay!?&rdquo;</p><p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say it out loud the thought that shakes me. Sure there was some mild level bi vibes I got from him but hell I just mistook it as his ability to be strongly empathetic. He worked with veterans.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think he was full on gay. I wouldn&rsquo;t have walked him into Nels arms if I did. Nel was great but the worst kind of heartbreaker.</p><p>&ldquo;Ariadne!&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie&rsquo;s voice fills the house and I can hear her door squeal open, shut close. She&rsquo;s in my room in two seconds, a spaghetti strap and shorts that mirror my own and she jumps on my queen size bed and squeals,</p><p>&ldquo;Did you fuck Steve Rogers!!??? Please, please, please say you did!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s gay?&rdquo; I counter back and she falls back on her haunches, looking at me skeptically,</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s old news. I thought you knew that. I thought that&rsquo;s why you invited the boys to the bar. So Nel had sam, I would have Bucky to leave you to Steve all for yourself&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>I blink my eyes, sitting up and shaking my head,</p><p>&ldquo;Pure, innocent coincidence. I just wanted wing friends.&rdquo;</p><p>She looks at me and laughs,</p><p>&ldquo;What did you think I meant when I said Sam was more Nel&rsquo;s type.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I shrug and she nods, before looking around my room.</p><p>&ldquo;I know that bomber jacket,&rdquo; she nods to the blue jacket resting on the back of my desk chair. I look at it, sigh, and throw my head on the back of my headboard. &ldquo;it belongs to a certain blue eyed soldier. So you did invite him in.&rdquo;</p><p>I can&rsquo;t help the smile that erupts over my face but I shake my head,</p><p>&ldquo;E, do you think that if I honestly fucked Steve Rogers I&rsquo;d be able to walk to work the next day? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>She thinks about it, furrowing her eyes together then sighs,</p><p>&ldquo;Probably not. All that super serum dick&hellip;.you&rsquo;d need at least a day of rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly. He walked me home.&rdquo;</p><p>She furrow&rsquo;s her eyebrows together.</p><p>&ldquo;You telling me Nel is the one who walked away with a good dicking down out of the three of us?&rdquo;</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>&ldquo;Looks like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother fucker.&rdquo; She says and I giggle as I lean into her.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever Ms. &lsquo; I have Bucky wrapped around my little finger&rsquo;! I want to hear more about that&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie is the kind of girl that loves to share details with the people she loved and I was always the first she would spill too. Unless it was something she was unsure about - something she had to feel out herself.</p><p>Then she&rsquo;d keep that shit so close to her heart and it&rsquo;d be up to me to pry it open with crowbar if necessary. </p><p>&ldquo;Hmmmmm&hellip;.let&rsquo;s get ready for brunch. Its nearly ten and it&rsquo;s going to take thirty minutes to get down to the island.&rdquo;</p><p>She was stalling, typical Elli style,</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get it out of you.&rdquo; I say and she rolls her eyes, smiling as she moves off my bed.</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you say Ariadne.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p>&ldquo;The gods blessed the earth when they created the man that is Sam Wilson.&rdquo;</p><p>The caf&eacute; is packed and were smooshed in a corner because New York decided to dip to the low forties and the idea of waiting outside for an hour felt like hell.</p><p>Nel is being not tactful at all, speaking loudly as he obnoxiously sips his coffee. Despite the scarf he wears, his neck is littered in dark blue and pepper bruises, a gift I&rsquo;m sure from Sam.</p><p>&ldquo;You are being ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.&rdquo; I say, looking up from my phone and he leans down, pushing even closer to me and Ellie.</p><p>&ldquo;I might be ridiculous but I just had the best goddamn 24 hours of my life. So shoot me for wanting the world to know how happy a certain Avenger made me.&rdquo;</p><p>I roll my eyes as I sit up more against the small booth I&rsquo;m sharing with Ellie. It was pure luck that just when Nel was putting our names in, a couple had gotten up and Ellie and I had rushed to grab the seat. We&rsquo;d alternate standing with Nel and sitting comfortably &ndash; Lucy&rsquo;s was always packed and having to stand an hour in even fall chilly temperatures made my knees sore.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the happiest I have ever seen you.&rdquo; Ellie notes from the comfortable place on my shoulder. The tendrils of her hair tickling my exposed neck, and her body warmth was a nice contrast to the cool air that kept creeping into the enclosed space. </p><p>&ldquo;Because I am my happiest,&rdquo; Nel bats his eye lashes before looking down at Ellie, &ldquo;So baby doll are you going to lay down some truth about you and Mr. Metal Arm or am I going to have to pull it out of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Ellie narrows her eyes at him before directing her gaze elsewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call him that&hellip;&rdquo; she finally says softly and Nel wiggles his eyebrows at me.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, why? Did Mr. Barnes fuck you so good you&rsquo;ve forgotten what it&rsquo;s like to laugh outside of your post orgasmic state?&rdquo;</p><p>I can&rsquo;t help but chuckle as she tries to swat him with her short legs, easily missing Nel who barely moves from the action.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop it Nel! It&rsquo;s not like that with me and him.&rdquo; her voice is light and I can tell she&rsquo;s pouting without having to look at her as Nel asks,</p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It's&hellip;.different.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is it different?&rdquo; he presses and she sighs, resting her chin on my shoulders and batting her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Make him stop.&rdquo; She whines and I laugh, nudging her forehead with my own before saying,</p><p>&ldquo;What makes you think he&rsquo;ll listen to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He always listens to you.&rdquo; she pouts and I shrug,</p><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;..maybe I&rsquo;m curious to hear more about your night with Bucky. You both were exuding some mad vibes the minute he sat down next to you.&rdquo;</p><p>She furrows her eyes together, pouting.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re terrible, you know that, strategically placing yourself in the middle so we were forced to be all close with them and keeping yourself out of arm&rsquo;s reach from Steve. Speaking of, what did happen with you and Steve? I&rsquo;m not forgetting that his jacket is still lying on your chair, speaking of.&rdquo;</p><p>I roll my eyes as Nel leans down, amusement twinkling in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Reallly? That&rsquo;s an interesting unfolding of events.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh my god the both of you. Nothing happened. Really. Steve lectured me on taking the subway home alone, like you both do and then walked me home.&rdquo;</p><p>I lean back in the booth, allowing the cold air from the window to counter the blood rising to my cheeks.</p><p>&ldquo;And then&hellip;&rdquo; Nel asks and I sigh, looking down at Ellie.</p><p>&ldquo;You have to give us all the juicy details on Bucky if I go any further.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I will!&rdquo; my body shakes from the enthusiastic way she bobs her head up and down and I sigh as I close my eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing really. He walked me up the stairs, I kissed him good night on the cheek. Then he asked me for my number and I gave it to him and he hasn&rsquo;t called me sense.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want to go into any further detail&hellip;.I was feeling insecure about it. Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t care too much about sharing my number with a boy and not hearing back from him but I thought by now I&rsquo;d have heard something. On the way over, Ellie had been nose deep in her phone, smiling to herself as she texted who I could only assume was Bucky. Nel had spent the weekend with Sam and I was left pining over someone who probably didn&rsquo;t like me like that.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been like a little over 24 hours&hellip;.&rdquo; Ellie can already sense me falling into myself, how I was placing up walls. For as flirty and outgoing that I could be, I didn&rsquo;t like the way Steve Grant Rogers made me feel. I was unsure, always second guessing myself. He broke down a lot of fucking walls I&rsquo;ve spent years mastering putting up.</p><p>But in a sick, tormented way I liked it?</p><p>&ldquo;Not to mention its Captain America. He&rsquo;s like one of the most important Avengers&hellip;.the big guy. He&rsquo;s probably just busy saving the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Nel&rsquo;s voice is light but it verges on the edge of danger, knowing that my mind was already decided as he flickers his eyes over to Ellie.</p><p>He hoped for all their sake he was right.</p><hr /><p>By Tuesday I&rsquo;m a fucking monster. Between hearing how Ellie had a date with Bucky that night, I wake up in a mean mood, fuming past Ellie in our small shared bathroom and bitching loudly about anything that annoys me. She ignores me, dutiful friend that she is, allowing me to bitch about how cold the water is, sigh exaggeratedly when my charcoal eyeliner breaks against my eye. She&rsquo;s known me long enough to know how to navigate past a bad mood and her guilt filled irises just fuel my anger.</p><p>Stupid fucking Captain America.</p><p>Everyone I encounter from my trek to my work is a victim to raging eyes that silently read &ldquo;go fuck yourself in a dark corner and die&rdquo;. I nearly lose my shit when a guy spills my $2 coffee on my silk, white blouse and gives an empathetic eye.</p><p>Work is too far away.</p><p>And probably not the brightest idea in my current state.</p><p>The only women on the floor consist of me, the main secretary and three other journalist. There were graphic designers and other behind the scenes staff that were heavier with a female staff, but the main and consistent writers were only full of five fucking women.</p><p>The 21st century hadn&rsquo;t shifted shit.</p><p>Its enough though, women who know when you&rsquo;re in a bad mood and instead of digging into why have enough social cues to leave you the fuck alone. Tiffany, the secretary offers me a dress she keeps around and that she&rsquo;d dry clean my shirt on the company dime which only threatens me to cry. Almost.</p><p>Instead I say thank you, change into the deep V-neck dress, ignoring the fact that it was most definitely designed as a party dress and throw my blazer over it, hoping that my hair covers enough of my cleavage.</p><p>By the time I walk into my first meeting, I&rsquo;m a little better.</p><p>Just a bit.</p><p>I have to deal with Tod, a mediocre writer who has strings in the right places checking out my boobs every few minutes. Have to tolerate Jeff, an alright guy with a gift for talent but no social cues from showing me his weekend plans. He had managed to get some woman to date him, awkward ass Jeff &ndash; imagine the fuck that &ndash; and I pretend to smile and be &nbsp;amused by his story. Stefanie who is sitting across from me can sense my annoyance and throws me a sympathetic glance. I had already texted her my annoyances with the world omitting the Steve Rogers part and she was sympathetic to my struggles. </p><p>I almost make it through my meeting. </p><p>Almost.</p><p>That&rsquo;s before my boss speeds up a deadline for two articles I haven&rsquo;t even been able to start because it&rsquo;s then I&rsquo;m giving the task of covering some shit Mediocre Tod couldn&rsquo;t handle. Fuck his rich daddy and his quiet donations to our company. It was killing me.</p><p>I&rsquo;m on the verge of losing my shit by the time that I walk to my office, tempted between finally giving into my angry, frustrated tears or just destroying my office until I felt satisfied before I &nbsp;hear my phone ring.</p><p>Internal - &nbsp;great. Probably someone I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with.</p><p>&ldquo;Whaaaaaattt.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean to sound annoyed and clipped but I had so much fucking work to do and on top of it all I forgot to eat breakfast and it was just a little past lunch. I was adding that to my list of annoyances for the day.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a visitor Ms. Bellamy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tiffany&rsquo;s voice is soft and cracks, it&rsquo;s different. Unlike the young blonde.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok. What do you want me to do about it?&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a pause. Tiffany had worked for my office for a while, so she knew that on bad days my attitude wasn&rsquo;t anything new. The pause makes me wonder what was up.</p><p>&ldquo;Umm, maybe&hellip;come to meet him? Or I can bring him to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That option. Tell him he has 5 minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>I hang up and sigh, straightening up. My office had a single window, so there was transparency among young journalist and more experienced writers. Though I was in a corner unit and had a nice space that offered privacy if I need to quick change into an outfit and was too lazy to move to bathroom, it also meant that I couldn&rsquo;t see who was coming toward me. I open my laptop, connecting it to my desktop screen as I begin outline the two different articles I need to complete. Find a good jazz station and take a deep breath.</p><p>I could pretend to be pleasant for five minutes</p><p>I so caught in breathing exercises I almost miss the light knock on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Ms. Bellamy,&rdquo; Tiffany&rsquo;s voice is soft as I flicker my eyes over to the door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re guest is here with lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>I&rsquo;m five seconds from cussing out whatever new football player thought it would be cute to waltz himself into my office when my heart stops.</p><p>There is no one other than mother fucking Steve Rogers moving into my office.</p><hr /><p>Steve had a long weekend. The kind where he was out of the country fighting international bad guys for over 72 hours kind of weekend. It was supposed to be a small intel unit &ndash; him, Rhodey, Natasha. Quick and sweet and he&rsquo;d be back in his bed as fast as he got out of it.</p><p>Of course it was a fucking trap.</p><p>It had worked out, in the end. They got the information that they needed, had a few individuals in custody. There was no major damage done to any cities and best of all, no need to call for backup. It was a lot of people&rsquo;s weekend off &ndash; if there was such a thing for protectors of the world &ndash; and he wanted to keep that up. No one in the Tower, himself included, understood boundaries and pushed themselves to hard. Invincible or powerful or sleathy or not, at the core they were all beings and beings had basic needs to survive.</p><p>So they rotated and while the burden had been heavier for him &ndash; taking too many gun shots that would bruise him underneath his suit and a few fractured ribs, he had come back in one piece Monday morning.</p><p>The instant he left the infirmary he had fallen on his bed and didn&rsquo;t emerge from the deep slumber he was in until Tuesday morning.</p><p>Which was why he hadn&rsquo;t thought about calling you.</p><p>He compartmentalized things. It was the only way to survive the type of things he saw, the emotional burden he placed on himself. He created distance and boundaries for himself and his personal life &ndash; his personal needs were the last of his areas he paid attention to. It&rsquo;s not until he&rsquo;s dragging himself into the kitchen, making a pot of coffee that he feels pain against his head.</p><p>He turns quickly and isn&rsquo;t surprised to see Bucky moving past him, shaking his head.</p><p>&ldquo;You fucking idiot.&rdquo; He mutters to him and Steve frowns, rubbing his head and returning to his coffee.</p><p>&ldquo;What I do now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t call Ariadne is what.&rdquo;</p><p>Son of a bitch. Steve&rsquo;s eyes pop over to Bucky who smirks, shaking his head as he leans against the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t call her and now she thinks you don&rsquo;t like her. And is in a mood and that&rsquo;s making Ellie nervous to meet up for drinks tonight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does that have to do with Ariadne? She wouldn&rsquo;t tell her to stay home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Bucky nods. &ldquo;But Ellie feels terrible her friend is getting ghosted by Captain America so you know, female comradery. Which is fair for their friendship but sucks for the possibility of my relationship. So your idiocy is fucking up my life.&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sighs leaning against the counter.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to forget to call her. I just went out on mission and-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t have a fucking smart phone or sense to get texting on that prehistoric machine to let her know,&rdquo; Bucky cuts him off. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Steve, I know you well enough to know that&rsquo;s a poor excuse. What do you think she is going to think?&rdquo;</p><p>Steve sighs, returning to the coffee pot.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to mess this up. I really want to get to know her. I&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Bucky finishes, pushing off the counter. &ldquo;So I did a little favor. Asked Ellie where Ariadne worked. Asked if she would mind sharing the address so &nbsp;my dear friend Steve could go and make amends with lunch.&rdquo;</p><p>He walks past Steve, placing a piece of paper beside him.</p><p>&ldquo;Figure out your fucking life and stop forcing me to continue to clean up your mess. And stop being such a pussy when it comes to women you like &ndash; that&rsquo;s how you lose all the good ones.&rdquo;</p><p>Bucky shakes his head and Steve can&rsquo;t help but give a side, grateful smile. Bucky could be a pain in the ass but he knew how to pull through when he really needed it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a little past 12:30 when he&rsquo;s walking through the glass doors of ESPN. He opted for burgers and fries from an upscale restaurant Tony had recommended once because you just seemed like the kind of woman who wasn&rsquo;t insecure enough to eat a good meal in front of him. He had also grabbed a bouquet of flowers for you &ndash; white roses laced with a fancy form of purple orchid that made him insecure when he stepped out of the elevator from the looks he was receiving. Maybe they were too fancy, possibly, but he didn&rsquo;t know what type of flowers you liked &ndash; if you were even a flower girl &ndash; and really wanted to make up for the delay in responding back to you. The more he thought about it, the shittier it felt to share a special moment with you and go silent for days.</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t mean to &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; you as Bucky had kindly put it.</p><p>What he didn&rsquo;t expect when you looked up from your monitor, thick black glasses falling down the bridge of your nose was the overwhelming feeling of lust mixed with relief to fill him. He hadn&rsquo;t thought he missed you, not really, but seeing you gives him a weird feeling of peace.</p><p>There&rsquo;s that and the ridiculous cut of the blue dress you wear as you look him up and down before sighing and returning your eyes back to the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks Tiffany. That&rsquo;ll be all for now.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;d forgotten about the young blonde giving him goo-goo eyes and she flickers back from you to him one last time before stepping out the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Surprised you even remembered my name to find out where I worked.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a dryness to your tone, your shoulders are tense as you keep your eyes on your monitor.</p><p>Yea &ndash; you were definitely pissed.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an idiot.&rdquo;</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what else to say as you stop moving your fingers for a second and he takes it as his cue to continue, &ldquo;I had a mission and&hellip;this sounds stupid even saying it out loud but I don&rsquo;t have text and I didn&rsquo;t think to call and leave a message and I sort of&hellip;missions I just am in a different &nbsp;mind space. I got back in yesterday and slept and didn&rsquo;t realize that I had been stupid until then so I thought I&rsquo;d bring you lunch and flowers. And if that&rsquo;s too much&hellip;I&rsquo;ll leave. You deserve better than what I put you through.&rdquo;</p><p>He sees you sigh, closing your eyes and taking intentional breaths before waving to the chair across from you,</p><p>&ldquo;Sounds fair.&rdquo;</p><p>Its awkward, the first fifteen minutes. You could even give Peggy a run for her money with your ability to not act impressed by the small notions of apology he&rsquo;s created. But after a few bites into your burger he senses you relaxing, easing into yourself. You don&rsquo;t pester him about what his mission was like, not like most people who normally are dying to hear about it, instead you ask him what interested him in art. How he was able to refine his skill. In return he asks about how you&rsquo;ve fallen into journalism, how you ended up at ESPN as a journalist. You speak passionately about your journey, your eyes lighting up and it&rsquo;s only when the both of you are down to your fries that you give a sigh. Not like the one before.</p><p>&ldquo;I really do need to get back to work. I have two deadlines my boss threw at me this morning and no fucking time to get it done.&rdquo;</p><p>You&rsquo;re voice is full of regret as you lean back in your chair, your eyes hooded as you swivel your chair back and forth. He nods, smiling as he falls back in his own seat, watching you curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame. I was thinking I was finally getting to the part where I redeem myself.&rdquo;</p><p>You smile, amused but you don&rsquo;t say anything.</p><p>Just watch him carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you again,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s careful with his next words, hunching over and staring at the table. &ldquo;I know&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t set the best track record the first time. Normally I&rsquo;m a bit better at this&hellip;well not dating.. ahh, I don&rsquo;t really date a lot but you know, getting to know a woman&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>He sounded like the world&rsquo;s biggest idiot. One hundred years old and still tripping over his words.</p><p>He flickers his eyes up at you and you&rsquo;re still watching curiously. He continues,</p><p>&ldquo;But I do learn from my mistakes. And I really&hellip;.want to get to know you. You are&hellip;I like spending time with you. Could I take you out maybe this Friday? Its my weekend off so I promise I won&rsquo;t be an idiot and accidently blow you off.&rdquo;</p><p>His voice is hopeful as he looks up at you and you give a lazy grin, pushing your chair back to your laptop and resuming your typing,</p><p>&ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s can be hard. Sometimes I work, sometimes I don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re games you know, and basketball is starting up and the Yankees by some miracle are in the semi-finals. So I&rsquo;ll probably be going to that,&rdquo; he got it. He fucked up. It was nice, his gesture, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. He was about to get up and apologize for wasting your time before you nod your head thoughtfully, looking over at him, &ldquo;I normally drag Ellie to these things but she hates it and only goes for the free seats and free booze. And selfie opportunities. But I have nice box seats for the game this Friday &ndash; want to be my plus one?&rdquo;</p><p>He wants to tell you he&rsquo;d jump off skyscrapers to be your plus one for the next decade of Yankee games. Instead he gives a coy smile and nods,</p><p>&ldquo;Yea &ndash; that sounds fun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; You say as you return your eyes back to your screen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you and tell you the details but I&rsquo;ll probably meet you there. I&rsquo;ll be working from home that day and typically have to run here before heading to games so it&rsquo;ll just be easier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure, whatever works best for you.&rdquo; he gets up and hesitates, wondering if he should ask to hug you, or just let himself out. When you don&rsquo;t move your eyes from the screen he takes it as his cue and leaves. He&rsquo;d won a second date, he wouldn&rsquo;t be pushy about the details.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, let me walk you out. Sorry, my boss emailed me and I have a bad habit of going into tunnel vision when my interest is peaked.&rdquo;</p><p>You stand up, shifting your dress, brushing crumbs off your bosom before smiling and walking toward him.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, who do I have to thank for sending over the courier lunch service?&rdquo;</p><p>You move past him with a confident ease, opening your door and strolling out into the office. He&rsquo;d forgotten how most of the workers had quieted with his appearance and they all fumble back into position as he catches up with you easily.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>You smile, shaking your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah. Ellie.&rdquo;</p><p>He furrows his eyebrows together as you look over at him,</p><p>&ldquo;Nel would have no shame letting Sam know I was in a mood from you ghosting me.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiles as you both make it to the elevator, stuffing his hands in his pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;Well are you? Still upset?&rdquo; he wants it to come off teasing but he knows the worry drips off each word, can&rsquo;t help but default to bad habits when he was around someone that impressed him. You look up at the ceiling, thinking through it before smiling and shrugging,</p><p>&ldquo;Depends on how impressed I am by your baseball knowledge.</p><hr /><p>Tag List:&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLmzyrERLwPWt7oIavzcIkw\">@geminimoonbeamx</a> <b><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mtaWaN_ighiYYScW7vLIC9w\">@ssweet-empowerment</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mi9ImHMJh5OaxHZPdeYy1LQ\">@capsofwinchesters</a>@<a href=\"http://tacohead13.tumblr.com/\">tacohead13</a>@<a href=\"http://harleycativy.tumblr.com/\">harleycativy</a>@<a href=\"http://pietrotheavenger.tumblr.com/\">pietrotheavenger</a>@<a href=\"http://francezka10.tumblr.com/\">francezka10</a>@<a href=\"http://papichulosebastian.tumblr.com/\">papichulosebastian</a>@<a href=\"http://obsessionsofmynerdheart.tumblr.com/\">obsessionsofmynerdheart</a>@<a href=\"http://melaninmarvel.tumblr.com/\">melaninmarvel</a>@<a href=\"http://avengedqueen26.tumblr.com/\">avengedqueen26</a>@<a href=\"http://nasteaxluvgal.tumblr.com/\">nasteaxluvgal</a>@<a href=\"https://winterbuttmunch.tumblr.com/\">winterbuttmunch</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbe29vW7LW2QdFTGx-XIrJg\">@nys30</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQpGSysFQQ2_z6AQ8OgRSAg\">@buckyslongasshair</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mbqZ-ncss0ZkPEoFPX5I76g\">@ohlumi</a>@wellthirsted @<a href=\"http://gifsbysimplysonia.tumblr.com/\">gifsbysimplysonia</a> @misskenni <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mSV8_iEBdIrspRVXhUIecAQ\">@harleycativy</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mB7Vy5g26g5-LAZcceFvi3g\">@maraudereestauderelb</a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m8Ag-2kNfXKRbOu7yIBRYcQ\">@chrisevans-sexualfrustrations</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mBHPHqRE0Z92Ed5hlLvX6vA\">@xceafh</a> @misskenni</b>\n\n</p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Tags are still open</b></p></p>",

Its not intentional, not even an afterthought for me. Saturdays are busy in the fall in the my world. There&rsquo;s college football and the NFL and the World Series and tennis and while my specialty was primarily football and basketball, it was natural for me to follow other things for the blog I ran on the side. Because whether men liked that I was a black women giving them tips on sports, they couldn&rsquo;t deny that I knew my shit. And I only knew my shit because I spent too &nbsp;much of my free time trending things and doing too much research. I never saw Ellie, she came in late Saturday morning&hellip;the sun barely rising while I slept. She was nestled in her room when I ran out and I had spent the day in my office, making use of the leftover lunch from the luncheon the day before and watching all the games on big screens while taking notes on my laptop. By the time I got home, Ellie was still perched in her room and I happily trailed into my own, shutting the door and stripping myself of clothes before falling asleep.</p>\n<p>When I wake up the next morning, its from a group text between Ellie and Nel:</p>\n<p><b>N: </b>Bitches. It&rsquo;s been 24 hours since we&rsquo;ve all been dicked down by an Avenger. Da fuck why haven&rsquo;t we shared the juicy deets yet?</p>\n<p><b>E:</b> Nel! You don&rsquo;t expose that stuff over text. Someone can hack it and use it against them</p>\n<p><b>N:</b> Or us</p>\n<p><b>E:</b> Or us!</p>\n</p>",

You guys barely stayed at your own homes anyway;you were always together. Unless he was filming a movie. One day, Chris brought up the idea of buying a house together. So you guys did.</p><p>The hunt for the perfect house took a while. Since you two were mostly in LA, you guys decided on buying the house in LA. <b>(Although, Chris wanted a home in Boston as well, but you two figured out that situation somewhere down the road)</b>. You guys found a beautiful house hidden in the quiet and private parts of LA. Everything about it was perfect, it had plenty of space for your dog and Dodger, a nice finished basement for a home gym, and a ton of other things. But, there was this one tiny room, with a tiny door, that you didn\u2019t know what to do with. It was just there. Until one day when Chris secretly decided he was going to do something about it. </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cI gotta head out real quick, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Chris said as he kissed your forehead. Before you can reply he was already out the door. You watched from the window as he backed out the driveway and left. </p><p>Lately, Chris has been leaving the house more often and he hasn\u2019t been telling you where. Which was a bit odd because when he comes back home from a long shoot, he\u2019d be in bed for a good few weeks and never leave. Not only that, you thought he\u2019d be a bit more upset over the Avengers coming to an end. </p><p>You trusted Chris with your life, and you knew he wouldn\u2019t go out and cheat on you. But your stupid imagination wouldn\u2019t stop putting these scenarios in your head and making you think of the worse things that could happen. </p><p>You sat on the couch while Dodger laid his head on your lap. Your dog, Marley, was nuzzled in your right side. </p><p>\u201cWhat could daddy be doing?\u201d You asked the two. Dodger let out a huff. You decided that you were going to ask Chris what was going on when he gets back. </p><p>You felt someone tapping your side. You stretched out your limbs as they\u2019ve been in the same position for a while. The person began to stroke your back. </p><p>\u201cHey sleepyhead.\u201d You opened your eyes and saw Chris in front of you. You groaned and stuffed your face into the pillow. </p><p>\u201cHow long have I\u2019ve been asleep?\u201d You asked. You didn\u2019t remember passing out on the couch. Chris chuckled and sat next to your hip. </p><p>\u201cI got back and you were already passed out.\u201d He answered, still rubbing your back. You glanced out the window and saw that it was night already. His hands moved soothingly making you drift off again. </p><p>\u201cNuh uh. Come on, get up.\u201d He turned your body over so that your back was to the couch. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You whined as he moved the hair out of your face. You rubbed the sleep out your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you, babe. I worked really hard on it.\u201d Chris sat you up and pressed a kiss to your lips. You moaned in satisfaction and wrapped your arms around his neck. He chuckled, pulling away and lifted you off the couch. </p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s head up.\u201d He excitedly led you up the stairs. You twirled your hair onto one side and stopped.</p><p>\u201cWh- What did you do?\u201d You questioned him. The dogs were no where to be seen and it was awful quiet.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see, now go.\u201d He led you around the halls of your house and stopped at the tiny room. A room that neither you or Chris ever used. It just came with the house. You eyed the door then Chris. </p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d He encouraged. You crouched down and twisted the knob. When you opened the door, you saw fairy lights strung to the top of the room. A small mattress covered in decorative pillows and fuzzy blankets was at the end of the room. There was a small table with a fake plant on it near the entrance of the room. Around the small corner, you saw your dogs pop their heads out. </p><p>\u201cChris. This is- wow. How did you even get all of this through the door?\u201d You gasped. Chris let out a laugh and crawled into the room after you.  When you got to the end of the room, there was a small space. The dogs were snuggled on a giant dog bed with little toys and plushies on it. </p><p>\u201cI decided to make this some kind of comfort room. Ya know? Like when you need a break and you just need to take a step back from the world. It\u2019s also a room for the dogs.\u201d He explained as he put his arm around you. You were laying down on the small mattress he placed in the room. </p><p>\u201cSo you like it?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cOh my god I love it. Who knew you had some sense of style in you.\u201d You joked. The decor inside  matched the whole vibe of the room. Suddenly you remember the question you were to ask him earlier. </p><p>\u201cWait. So you aren\u2019t cheating on me?\u201d You asked innocently. Chris\u2019s head snapped at you. </p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would I cheat on you?\u201d He asked as he moved to look at you. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been secretive and you kept leaving the house! I couldn\u2019t help but think of the negative things that could\u2019ve been happening!\u201d You defended. Chris sighed as a lop sided grin made its way on his face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you think that. But to clarify I\u2019m not cheating and I will never do it. I love you too much to even do something like that.\u201d He said as he stroked your cheek.

You guys barely stayed at your own homes anyway;you were always together. Unless he was filming a movie. One day, Chris brought up the idea of buying a house together. So you guys did.</p><p>The hunt for the perfect house took a while. Since you two were mostly in LA, you guys decided on buying the house in LA. <b>(Although, Chris wanted a home in Boston as well, but you two figured out that situation somewhere down the road)</b>. You guys found a beautiful house hidden in the quiet and private parts of LA. Everything about it was perfect, it had plenty of space for your dog and Dodger, a nice finished basement for a home gym, and a ton of other things. But, there was this one tiny room, with a tiny door, that you didn\u2019t know what to do with. It was just there. Until one day when Chris secretly decided he was going to do something about it. </p><p>~</p><p>\u201cI gotta head out real quick, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Chris said as he kissed your forehead. Before you can reply he was already out the door. You watched from the window as he backed out the driveway and left. </p><p>Lately, Chris has been leaving the house more often and he hasn\u2019t been telling you where. Which was a bit odd because when he comes back home from a long shoot, he\u2019d be in bed for a good few weeks and never leave. Not only that, you thought he\u2019d be a bit more upset over the Avengers coming to an end. </p><p>You trusted Chris with your life, and you knew he wouldn\u2019t go out and cheat on you. But your stupid imagination wouldn\u2019t stop putting these scenarios in your head and making you think of the worse things that could happen. </p><p>You sat on the couch while Dodger laid his head on your lap. Your dog, Marley, was nuzzled in your right side. </p><p>\u201cWhat could daddy be doing?\u201d You asked the two. Dodger let out a huff. You decided that you were going to ask Chris what was going on when he gets back. </p><p>You felt someone tapping your side. You stretched out your limbs as they\u2019ve been in the same position for a while. The person began to stroke your back. </p><p>\u201cHey sleepyhead.\u201d You opened your eyes and saw Chris in front of you. You groaned and stuffed your face into the pillow. </p><p>\u201cHow long have I\u2019ve been asleep?\u201d You asked. You didn\u2019t remember passing out on the couch. Chris chuckled and sat next to your hip. </p><p>\u201cI got back and you were already passed out.\u201d He answered, still rubbing your back. You glanced out the window and saw that it was night already. His hands moved soothingly making you drift off again. </p><p>\u201cNuh uh. Come on, get up.\u201d He turned your body over so that your back was to the couch. </p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You whined as he moved the hair out of your face. You rubbed the sleep out your eyes. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you, babe. I worked really hard on it.\u201d Chris sat you up and pressed a kiss to your lips. You moaned in satisfaction and wrapped your arms around his neck. He chuckled, pulling away and lifted you off the couch. </p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s head up.\u201d He excitedly led you up the stairs. You twirled your hair onto one side and stopped.</p><p>\u201cWh- What did you do?\u201d You questioned him. The dogs were no where to be seen and it was awful quiet.  </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see, now go.\u201d He led you around the halls of your house and stopped at the tiny room. A room that neither you or Chris ever used. It just came with the house. You eyed the door then Chris. </p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d He encouraged. You crouched down and twisted the knob. When you opened the door, you saw fairy lights strung to the top of the room. A small mattress covered in decorative pillows and fuzzy blankets was at the end of the room. There was a small table with a fake plant on it near the entrance of the room. Around the small corner, you saw your dogs pop their heads out. </p><p>\u201cChris. This is- wow. How did you even get all of this through the door?\u201d You gasped. Chris let out a laugh and crawled into the room after you.  When you got to the end of the room, there was a small space. The dogs were snuggled on a giant dog bed with little toys and plushies on it. </p><p>\u201cI decided to make this some kind of comfort room. Ya know? Like when you need a break and you just need to take a step back from the world. It\u2019s also a room for the dogs.\u201d He explained as he put his arm around you. You were laying down on the small mattress he placed in the room. </p><p>\u201cSo you like it?\u201d He asked. </p><p>\u201cOh my god I love it. Who knew you had some sense of style in you.\u201d You joked. The decor inside  matched the whole vibe of the room. Suddenly you remember the question you were to ask him earlier. </p><p>\u201cWait. So you aren\u2019t cheating on me?\u201d You asked innocently. Chris\u2019s head snapped at you. </p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would I cheat on you?\u201d He asked as he moved to look at you. </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been secretive and you kept leaving the house! I couldn\u2019t help but think of the negative things that could\u2019ve been happening!\u201d You defended. Chris sighed as a lop sided grin made its way on his face. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you think that. But to clarify I\u2019m not cheating and I will never do it. I love you too much to even do something like that.\u201d He said as he stroked your cheek. You grabbed his hand that was on your cheek and held it. </p><p>\u201cGood, because you\u2019re not getting rid of me that easily.\u201d You quipped. His eyes twinkled as he leaned in. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning to.\u201d His lips crashed onto yours.

The sassy full-figured Puerto Rican girl from Chicago holds down a job as she tries to deal with the real world. She continues her studies and freelances as a consultant for museums around the world.

Seriously, I don\u2019t even remember going back to my room.\u201d Thalia presses her palm against the window, looking out over the city. \u00a0\u201cThe mini-bar was empty the next morning, booze and chocolate, and I didn\u2019t attend any of the other sessions I was supposed to proctor for the museum. Thank God my flight was for Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see him again?\u201d the calming voice asks.</p><p>Thalia turns on her heels. She shrugs, looking down at her boots. Her blasted boots she\u2019s never been able to get rid of because of all the memories attached to them. She\u2019s had them resoled twice to make them last. Declining to share that with the therapist, she says, \u201cI was across the street at the pharmacy when I watched him pull away in an Uber. I bought another bottle of wine and a box of donuts.\u201d She pats her thighs. \u201cThere was still some wine left the next morning\u2026 And if you ever try to turn one of these sessions around, to discuss my eating habits, I\u2019m out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d the older woman says. \u201cYou seem healthy, despite being a big girl.\u201d She tilts her head to the side, doodling in the margins on her paper. \u201cDo you exercise?\u201d</p><p>Thalia walks to the bookshelves. She always believed one could tell a lot about a person by the books on their shelves. Tom\u2019s book is rested on a side table and she runs her hand over the shiny cover. She doesn\u2019t indicate the man in question is him.</p><p>To distract herself, she pulls an old leather bound volume from the shelf. \u201cLovely copy,\u201d she states, tenderly caressing the crepey thin pages. \u201cI try to get in about fifteen thousand steps a day. I lift weights, and eat healthy.\u201d She slowly bounces her head up and down. \u201cThe man I was living with before I moved here to Madrid, he was a bit of a fitness buff. I may not look like it, but I take care of myself. I\u2019m actually down in weight a bit, my clothes fit better since moving here. I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s depression or just becoming a true <i>Madrile\u00f1a\u2026</i> Six smaller meals a day seems to work for me.\u201d She places the book back on the shelf. \u201cMy apartment is close to the MAN and I\u2019m able to walk most of the places I need to go.\u201d</p><p>The therapist watches as Thalia continues to saunter around the room. \u201cWhere do you like to go? Have you made friends here?\u201d</p><p><b><a href=\"https://wp.me/s7hNsE-exposed\">Click here to read more</a></b></p><p>Reader tags under the cut</p>[[MORE]]<p>list in abc order- updated February

Everything was wild, and it was safe to say that shit was going to hit the fan. Or more so, it had already had. The news media was going crazy after the events that had escalated last night, and you didn\u2019t know what to do. Basically everyone on social media shammed you for your actions. Forgetting that it takes two to tango and you weren\u2019t completely at fault. But you could understand why some people who blame everything on you, nobody likes to put their favourite celebrities in a bad situation. Also the situation looked bad on your part, just in general. An up and coming singer, has a small fan base. Sleeps with another even more famous\u2026yeah it does look bad.  </p><p>You\u2019d never picture yourself as someone who\u2019d be with a guy who\u2019s engaged. Not in a million years. The whole thing kinda just happened. Sure it was wrong, but that\u2019s how things went. Neither the less, people wanted a bunch of interviews with you, wanting to know why on earth you\u2019d ruin someone else\u2019s life. You didn\u2019t want to take any of those interviews. But your team told you that it would probably be best to take them. Otherwise, people would just take whatever they hear. So it\u2019s worth a shot.  </p><p>Chris has tried to talk to you several times after everything exploded. You also wanted to talk to him, but your agent told you not to. Your agent had a lot of hope for you. So she didn\u2019t want your reputation to be ruined. So you tried your best to listen to her.  </p><p>It was currently Tuesday night and you were in the studio. Trying to rewrite one of the songs that was supposed to go onto your newest album. You didn\u2019t like the hook so you wanted to rewrite it. There was no flow of inspiration in you, you were bored. You wanted to just go and see Chris, but you were being watched like a ducking hawk. You couldn\u2019t take it. This wasn\u2019t how you wanted your life to be like. Yet this is what is currently was. You decided to give up and turn on the tv, maybe there was something to watch? Eh, it really didn\u2019t matter. You just needed to take something off of your mind. Yet when you turned on the tv, it just made you even more stressed. </p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being in that situation.\u201d The talk show host stated. His ex was on national tv crying a whole ass fucking river. Chris complained about her a lot. They were forced to date each other for movie press, but after the movie press was over she honestly thought he liked her. He wanted to break it off with her, but his team told him not too.  </p><p>\u201cYes, I just couldn\u2019t imagine in a million years something like this happening. If only Chris haven\u2019t fell for that\u2026that bitch.\u201d You rolled your eyes, and turned off the tv. You couldn\u2019t handle it. You were on the verge of breaking down, but you tried to keep your shit together.  </p><p>Ron, the man who was watching you was wondering were you were going. You told him you needed to head over to the drugstore. He asked to come with you but you told him no. He was suspicious but let you go.  </p><p>You weren\u2019t headed to the drugstore (obviously), you were heading over to Chris\u2019s house. Which was a stupid idea. </p><p>After you left the studio a verge of paparazzi were standing outside. Asking all of the questions everyone is dying to know. You almost didn\u2019t make it to the car. Then once you finally did make it. You couldn\u2019t even fucking start it because everyone was crowding around it, and if you tried to move the car. You\u2019d just hit someone, and you\u2019re not trying to start a whole other situation. You ended up sitting in your car for 16 minutes before you were able to leave.  </p><p>Now you were heading over to Chris\u2019s house sweaty, tired and annoyed. It\u2019s safe to say that you weren\u2019t doing well.  </p><p>You rushed over and tried to knock on the door. You didn\u2019t want to draw as much attention as you just did. So you were hoping he\u2019d hurry up and answer the door. Except he didn\u2019t.  </p><p>His ex did.  </p>",

If only Chris haven\u2019t fell for that\u2026that bitch.\u201d You rolled your eyes, and turned off the tv. You couldn\u2019t handle it. You were on the verge of breaking down, but you tried to keep your shit together.  </p><p>Ron, the man who was watching you was wondering were you were going. You told him you needed to head over to the drugstore. He asked to come with you but you told him no. He was suspicious but let you go.  </p><p>You weren\u2019t headed to the drugstore (obviously), you were heading over to Chris\u2019s house. Which was a stupid idea. </p><p>After you left the studio a verge of paparazzi were standing outside. Asking all of the questions everyone is dying to know. You almost didn\u2019t make it to the car. Then once you finally did make it. You couldn\u2019t even fucking start it because everyone was crowding around it, and if you tried to move the car. You\u2019d just hit someone, and you\u2019re not trying to start a whole other situation. You ended up sitting in your car for 16 minutes before you were able to leave.  </p><p>Now you were heading over to Chris\u2019s house sweaty, tired and annoyed. It\u2019s safe to say that you weren\u2019t doing well.  </p><p>You rushed over and tried to knock on the door. You didn\u2019t want to draw as much attention as you just did. So you were hoping he\u2019d hurry up and answer the door. Except he didn\u2019t.  </p><p>His ex did.  </p>",
