Yet, here we are. And it\u2019s also ironic that I\u2019m saying all of this almost a year to when we first started talking. We became friends in a quite unlikely circumstance but I\u2019m so glad that it happened. Who would\u2019ve guessed a friendship would have come out of me sending a random anon to someone on tumblr? It\u2019s so strange to think about, yet, I\u2019m guessing thats why people say \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d.  So without that one night when I was staying up late crying, none of the major events following would have ever happened. Who knows where I would\u2019ve been now. </p><p>Emma, for the past eleven months, you have helped me through so many tough times i don\u2019t know how to express how thankful I am. You\u2019ve given me such good advice on how to cope with my issues I\u2019m forever grateful. Not only have you comforted me when I\u2019m feeling upset, you\u2019ve always made me smile and laugh no matter the circumstances. Seriously, you never believe me when I tell you how sweet you are lmao. From literally giving me your old email so I could make an ao3 to complimenting my art 24/7, you\u2019re truly one of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met. You have made such a large impact on my life and have taught me so many new things I didn\u2019t know before. (Like teaching me how to use emojis ironically and basically everything else in the twitter language) Emma, legit you\u2019re such an intelligent and talented person I hope you become a famous writer one day because no joke your fanfics have some of the best writing I\u2019ve ever seen. Anyway, to sum up, I never would have thought you would be my friend but I\u2019m so sincerely glad that you are, I wouldn\u2019t have changed anything that happened in the past. I hope you had a good birthday Emma, I love you dude\u270c\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f   Sincerely, your Jyrus Friend\u2122\ufe0f aka Anon-From-Before aka Hailey :\u2019)</p>",
