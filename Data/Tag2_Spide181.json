Everything was done right, the animation was used to full advatage, the music, the characters, the plot and the storytelling - everything was great, if not completly original, but done in a fresh, dynamic and sincere way.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/509b20942a3d40921025e9529f4cda7e/tumblr_pkikh6Aw7D1tsnigg_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Once again it gets proven that the main character doesn&rsquo;t have to be ordinary to be relatable or interesting.&nbsp;Miles Morales is not another plain, socially awkward guy. No, quite the opposite, he is cool, carefree and confident, has friends, good grades and always a smart joke to offer. He has some quarrels with his parents - but nothing extreme, they love each other very much - just that natural little disparaty between parents pushing thier child to make something of himself and the child just trying to find who he wants to be. It&rsquo;s relatable to youngsters, but not so overdone yet to be preachy.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie makes an intersting point by showing how parents don&rsquo;t have to be absent or outright extreme abusers to still make for an engaging influence for their children and how even the best intensions and love don&rsquo;t make relationships without conflict or strain. Miles&rsquo;s parents have an actual role in the movie and actually have some meanigful and moving moments.</p><p>The characters are plastic, likeable and well-written, acting logical and with understandable motives, flaws and charisma. Mainly Miles is a smart kid doing his best, coming off free and easy, trying to find his way.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a523abb1eaa779fd71eec8fd4db75b3/tumblr_pkikhh9U621tsnigg_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>There is uncle Aaron, who without the immediate concern and responsibily of a parent takes the role of a relaxing, charismatic and casual confidant to Miles and later gets and interesing shady plot twist.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/456f3c3a83b25dd1e1aad01622e79acc/tumblr_pkikhiJRLS1tsnigg_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/459ccb3bd825c8b354162303ef993245/tumblr_pkikhfmm4R1tsnigg_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Then we have Peter B. Parker an older version of the typical Spiderman, with a future that took a surprisingly realistic bleak turn. But don&rsquo;t be fooled, despite the rugged and a bit neglected appearence, he is still the capable hero we know, with experience and abilities you can count on. His start as a teacher is a bit ruff, but he learns step by step, not only winning the sympathy of the audience but also a rewarding development of his student.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/644a85f6d712ab42e74e4a0472ad808d/tumblr_pkinsp3y2d1tsnigg_400.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>Next we have Gwen, a pretty action girl, taking her superhero role with style and spark. This is not a love story by any stretch, but her presence is powerful and makes for a nice dynamic with Miles.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3f540b6dd412b22fc6a7aa30682911b/tumblr_pkinajcCJe1tsnigg_540.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>All Spidermans have their own distinguished tone and make for a solid, funny and powerful group. Their protectivness towards Miles as the latest Spidey, who still has lots to learn, without derogating his importance is sweet. Their respective fashion, fighting style, personalities and quirks prove great attention to detail and make the ride that much more lively.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e39f4102ffb83981958a7a58b070b09/tumblr_pkikhlkBLf1tsnigg_640.gif\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>It&rsquo;s also a great origin story for our main hero, since he has the abilities and the brains, but still needs to belive in himself.

And the style!!!! I haven\u2019t been this enamored with an animated movie\u2019s artistic style since <i>Song of the Sea </i>(or any Cartoon Saloon movie, really), and it was such a nice experience. I kept waiting for maybe one scene to just not work or not amaze me as much as the last, but no, the entire movie was just gorgeous and so interesting to look at. <br/>I definitely want to download it once it\u2019s out just so I can go through it frame by frame. And I really hope the dvd/blu-ray shows a lot of the storyboards because I\u2019d love to see how this movie was mapped out. Color keys would be nice to see, too.</li><li>I cried more than I expected to, lmao. First when Peter B. met up with Aunt May (who\u2019s voiced by Lily Tomlin by the way, that was a nice surprise), then when Miles\u2019 father told him he loved him through the closed door, and then a little at the very end just because the overall message was so sweet.</li><li>I was kind of hoping Peter B. would recognize Gwen, or at least have a\u00a0\u201choly shit, you\u2019re alive???\u201d moment with her, but I guess that would have pulled too much focus away from his subplot with MJ, so it\u2019s fine. I did really like that it looked like he was going to patch things up with her at the end now that he\u2019s confident about being a parent.<br/>Now that I think of it, though, did Peter B. even have the dead Gwen storyline in his dimension? I assumed Gwen dying would be part of any Spider-Man universe where he eventually ends up with MJ, but I\u2019m not familiar with the comics, so idk.</li><li>Miles is adorable and really just a great character all-around. I haven\u2019t seen the MCU Spider-Man movies, so this may be something that\u2019s done well in those too, but this was the first Spider-Man movie where I actually believed Spidey was a kid. I mean, the Tobey Maguire movies came out when I was still a kid myself, so I never really saw him as someone around my age. And I always thought Andrew Garfield\u2019s take was good, but he was also too confident for me to really see him as a typical teenager, so he seemed older than his character.<br/>But Miles is written very believably as a teenager, and I like that his inexperience as a hero (and just with life in general) is what really drives his character arc. He had this really organic coming-of-age storyline, and I loved it.<br/>There were also other little things that really made his age more apparent, like him going straight home to his parents because he was upset and afraid after watching Spider-Man die, or him deliberately trying to fail out of his new school because suddenly being surrounded by other smart kids made him insecure (holy fuck was that relatable as a former ~G&amp;T kid), or him being hyper aware of all the other kids noticing every time he did something embarrassing.<br/>Not that adults never do any of those things, ofc, but all those details made him seem that much more vulnerable, so you really appreciate his growth and confidence by the end of the movie.</li><li>All the Spidey gang\u2019s interactions were great. I especially liked Noir comforting Peni when her robot was destroyed, that was really sweet. And I loved the gang staying behind and listening to Peter B. tell Miles that he couldn\u2019t come on their last mission. You could tell that none of them wanted to ditch him, and that they wanted to have faith in him, but they also couldn\u2019t risk him not being able to follow through. I like that all of the Spideys genuinely care about each other, and that they can all empathize with one another\u2019s struggles and losses.</li><li>I liked Kingpin as a villain. At first, I was a little thrown off by his design and thought it looked almost too out-of-place, but it wound up really working. He\u2019s just this HUGE solid black square of a dude, and it makes for an interesting contrast when you compare him to the heroes (whose designs allow for quicker/more dynamic movement).<br/>Also, I appreciated that Aaron (forgot his villain name) wasn\u2019t just needlessly evil and actually refused to kill Miles when he realized who he was. Initially, I thought he pulled the mask back on Miles so that he wouldn\u2019t have to see his nephew\u2019s face when he killed him, but no, he actually let him go. I\u2019m&hellip; kind of lost on his motivation for siding with the bad guys in the first place, but idk, maybe I missed something.</li><li>It was funny! And in a really refreshing way for a superhero movie, too. I\u2019m used to MCU\u2019s annoying habit of building up a really tense scene and then killing it with some character\u2019s dumb comment followed by what feels like 20 minutes of riffing, and <i>Spider-Verse</i> was just so wonderfully, mercifully <i>not</i> that. God bless.</li><li>I loved seeing a Spider-Man fight take place in somewhere other than NYC. I mean, that location makes sense because it\u2019s probably the best place for a web-slinging hero to hang out, but it was an interesting change of scenery to throw all these Spider people into a forest or an inter-dimensional cataclysm. That was really cool.</li><li>I can\u2019t believe this movie made me like a Post Malone song. The audacity!!!!!</li><li>This is dumb, but I liked that Peter Parker and I share a birth year. I guess he must be a sagittarius or a capricorn tho if he was still 26 when he died.</li><li>The <i>memes</i>, my god.</li></ul><p>tl;dr: LOVED it, gonna try to see it in theaters at least one more time.</p>",

And the style!!!! I haven\u2019t been this enamored with an animated movie\u2019s artistic style since <i>Song of the Sea </i>(or any Cartoon Saloon movie, really), and it was such a nice experience. I kept waiting for maybe one scene to just not work or not amaze me as much as the last, but no, the entire movie was just gorgeous and so interesting to look at. <br>I definitely want to download it once it\u2019s out just so I can go through it frame by frame. And I really hope the dvd/blu-ray shows a lot of the storyboards because I\u2019d love to see how this movie was mapped out. Color keys would be nice to see, too.</li><li>I cried more than I expected to, lmao. First when Peter B. met up with Aunt May (who\u2019s voiced by Lily Tomlin by the way, that was a nice surprise), then when Miles\u2019 father told him he loved him through the closed door, and then a little at the very end just because the overall message was so sweet.</li><li>I was kind of hoping Peter B. would recognize Gwen, or at least have a\u00a0\u201choly shit, you\u2019re alive???\u201d moment with her, but I guess that would have pulled too much focus away from his subplot with MJ, so it\u2019s fine. I did really like that it looked like he was going to patch things up with her at the end now that he\u2019s confident about being a parent.<br>Now that I think of it, though, did Peter B. even have the dead Gwen storyline in his dimension? I assumed Gwen dying would be part of any Spider-Man universe where he eventually ends up with MJ, but I\u2019m not familiar with the comics, so idk.</li><li>Miles is adorable and really just a great character all-around. I haven\u2019t seen the MCU Spider-Man movies, so this may be something that\u2019s done well in those too, but this was the first Spider-Man movie where I actually believed Spidey was a kid. I mean, the Tobey Maguire movies came out when I was still a kid myself, so I never really saw him as someone around my age. And I always thought Andrew Garfield\u2019s take was good, but he was also too confident for me to really see him as a typical teenager, so he seemed older than his character.<br>But Miles is written very believably as a teenager, and I like that his inexperience as a hero (and just with life in general) is what really drives his character arc. He had this really organic coming-of-age storyline, and I loved it.<br>There were also other little things that really made his age more apparent, like him going straight home to his parents because he was upset and afraid after watching Spider-Man die, or him deliberately trying to fail out of his new school because suddenly being surrounded by other smart kids made him insecure (holy fuck was that relatable as a former ~G&amp;T kid), or him being hyper aware of all the other kids noticing every time he did something embarrassing.<br>Not that adults never do any of those things, ofc, but all those details made him seem that much more vulnerable, so you really appreciate his growth and confidence by the end of the movie.</li><li>All the Spidey gang\u2019s interactions were great. I especially liked Noir comforting Peni when her robot was destroyed, that was really sweet. And I loved the gang staying behind and listening to Peter B. tell Miles that he couldn\u2019t come on their last mission.
