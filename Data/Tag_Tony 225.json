The butterflies in your stomach were going in every direction possible which made it even that much harder to concentrate on what the teacher was saying and the assignment you had to then work on.</p><p>So, instead of working on the assignment you wrote out a note to Tony that you were going to hand him when class was over. But as soon as you were finished writing it, you reread it and crumpled it up, thinking it was the stupidest idea you\u2019ve had in years.</p><p>\u201c<i>What am I? In high school?</i>\u201d you thought.\u00a0\u201c<i>I should just be able to face him and talk to him. How is it that I\u2019m scared to do it though?</i>\u201d You folded your arms on the desk and placing your forehead on them you sighed, still not knowing what to do.</p><!-- more --><p>The bell rang and you started packing your things, watching Tony out of the corner of your eye. He acted as though there was no problem at all. He noticed you were acting a little distant this morning and went to ask you about it but you quickly grabbed your things and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>Going back to your dorm, you laid on the bed. You started thinking about all this flirting the two of you had been doing for the last several months and wondered if any of it was real. If all of it was just a game. If Tony even liked you that way. You grabbed your pillow and screamed into it.</p><p>At that point your phone started to ring which made you stop. Looking around for it and not seeing it anywhere on the nightstand or desk, you remembered you threw it in your purse. Fishing around for it and finding it buried underneath everything, you looked at it before the call ended.\u00a0\u201cTony\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u201d it read.</p><p>You flopped back down on the bed, phone still clutched in your hand. You just didn\u2019t know what to do. It rang again and again it was Tony. Placing the phone on the nightstand, you decided that you were going to stay in your room for the rest of the day. You weren\u2019t sure how you were going to face Tony about this but you know you had too.</p><p>Falling asleep, you had several dreams about him and all of them were about you and him being together. From hand holding to just cuddling each other, each dream was different from the next.</p><p>You woke up from having your stomach make the loudest noise, realizing you haven&rsquo;t eaten anything all day and it was somehow already 5 PM. Rubbing your eyes and hearing your stomach once again, you got up and looked in the mirror fixing your hair to make you look somewhat presentable to go to the cafeteria and grab something to eat.</p><p>Grabbing your phone, you pressed the button to wake it up and couldn\u2019t believe what your notifs looked like. Eight missed calls and 10 texts from Tony, along with three missed calls from your mom and six texts from her all asking the same thing: \u201c<i>why\u00a0aren\u2019t you answering?</i>\u201d, \u201c<i>is everything ok?</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>please call!</i>\u201d</p><p>As you walked over to the cafeteria, you called your mom and let her know that everything was fine and you just needed some time away from classes cuz you weren\u2019t feeling good. You didn\u2019t think that it would be a good idea to let your mom know that this \u201cfeeling\u201d\u00a0was about a boy because she didn\u2019t exactly approve of you having a boyfriend during school, which never made any sense to you since your sister was able to do that when she was in school and not get yelled at about it. But you brushed the thought out of your mind.</p><p>After you got off the phone with her, you hesitated to contact Tony and let him know that you were ok. Bringing up his contact info, your thumb ghosted over the screen while you stared at the name you had for him:\u00a0Tony \u2764\ufe0f. You quickly closed out of it and swiped the contacts page off. Sighing and almost wanting to cry, you rushed to the cafeteria, grabbed a few things and went back to your dorm.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, phone placed in front of you, you spent the next hour and a half debating wether to call him or not. In the end you couldn\u2019t being yourself to do it so you decided that the better thing to do would be to suck it up and face him tomorrow.</p><p>You arrived a bit earlier than usual for class that morning, telling yourself over and over that this was just ridiculous and you were stupid for acting the way you were and how could you be such a coward. You also tried repeating a couple things over that you planned on telling him when he showed up. And then it happened.</p><p>You saw him enter the room wearing that one t-shirt you like so much on him and all your thoughts went out the door. Your mouth felt like it was now the Sahara Desert and your body felt like it became a two-by-four. Even your face felt flushed and hot.</p><p>When he saw you, his eyes immediately widened and went right over to you asking if everything was ok. You nodded, trying to have actual words come out. He could tell that something was going through your mind, so he sat down and gently pulled you down to the seat next to him. He was about to ask you what happened yesterday, while you were about to ask him who the girl was but the teacher walked in to have the class start. Questioning each other would have to wait.</p><p>The two of you silently worked through the lecture and when it came time for the class to work on the assignment the teacher gave out, Tony looked over at you and nudged your arm.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok, [Y/N]? I tried calling and texting you last night but you didn\u2019t answer. I was really worried.\u201d<br/></p><p>You looked at him and you could see that he really was worried but then wondered if this was all an act. You sucked in a breath and let it out.</p><p>\u201cEverything is ok. But I want to know something.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br/></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe you were going to say this but you knew that if you didn\u2019t, things would need to change between you two. Yet somehow you also knew that if your thoughts were confirmed on who this other girl was, things would still need to change.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Tony. Like a lot. Like, a\u00a0\u201cmore than a friend\u201d type thing. Do you like me that way too? Do you think we could be boyfriend and girlfriend?\u201d<br/></p><p>Tony was a little surprised by what you said. But then he looked down, smiled a bit then looked back at you.</p><p>\u201cI already have a girlfriend, [Y/N]. I\u2019m sorry. But if you wanted to be my girlfriend, you should\u2019ve said something. I mean, I do like you. I really do. It\u2019s just&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all that flirting we were doing.. don\u2019t you think that should\u2019ve told you I wanted to be with you?\u201d<br/></p><p>He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not very good at reading signs of flirting. I need to have someone tell me that they like me in order for me to want to be with them.\u201d</p><p>You really couldn\u2019t believe what he was telling you. He seemed like he was a pro at the flirting game and then says that he\u2019s bad at reading the signs of it. Good gravy, this was all starting to unravel right here in your lap. You turned back to the assignment and started working on it.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N]&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>You put up a hand in front of his face and didn\u2019t look at him for the rest of the class. It was hard concentrating but you were doing the best you could. And when the bell rang, you silently and quickly gathered your things and walked out without a word to Tony.</p>",

You&rsquo;re not really sure if he ever knew, even though there were times when it seemed like he did. And after graduating, you both went your separate ways but you still had those feelings for him. Years later, he reenters your life in the craziest way.

You\u2019re not really sure if he ever knew, even though there were times when it seemed like he did. And after graduating, you both went your separate ways but you still had those feelings for him.

He acted as though there was no problem at all. He noticed you were acting a little distant this morning and went to ask you about it but you quickly grabbed your things and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>Going back to your dorm, you laid on the bed. You started thinking about all this flirting the two of you had been doing for the last several months and wondered if any of it was real. If all of it was just a game. If Tony even liked you that way. You grabbed your pillow and screamed into it.</p><p>At that point your phone started to ring which made you stop. Looking around for it and not seeing it anywhere on the nightstand or desk, you remembered you threw it in your purse. Fishing around for it and finding it buried underneath everything, you looked at it before the call ended.\u00a0\u201cTony\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u201d it read.</p><p>You flopped back down on the bed, phone still clutched in your hand. You just didn\u2019t know what to do. It rang again and again it was Tony. Placing the phone on the nightstand, you decided that you were going to stay in your room for the rest of the day. You weren\u2019t sure how you were going to face Tony about this but you know you had too.</p><p>Falling asleep, you had several dreams about him and all of them were about you and him being together. From hand holding to just cuddling each other, each dream was different from the next.</p><p>You woke up from having your stomach make the loudest noise, realizing you haven\u2019t eaten anything all day and it was somehow already 5 PM. Rubbing your eyes and hearing your stomach once again, you got up and looked in the mirror fixing your hair to make you look somewhat presentable to go to the cafeteria and grab something to eat.</p><p>Grabbing your phone, you pressed the button to wake it up and couldn\u2019t believe what your notifs looked like. Eight missed calls and 10 texts from Tony, along with three missed calls from your mom and six texts from her all asking the same thing: \u201c<i>why\u00a0aren\u2019t you answering?</i>\u201d, \u201c<i>is everything ok?</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>please call!</i>\u201d</p><p>As you walked over to the cafeteria, you called your mom and let her know that everything was fine and you just needed some time away from classes cuz you weren\u2019t feeling good. You didn\u2019t think that it would be a good idea to let your mom know that this \u201cfeeling\u201d\u00a0was about a boy because she didn\u2019t exactly approve of you having a boyfriend during school, which never made any sense to you since your sister was able to do that when she was in school and not get yelled at about it. But you brushed the thought out of your mind.</p><p>After you got off the phone with her, you hesitated to contact Tony and let him know that you were ok. Bringing up his contact info, your thumb ghosted over the screen while you stared at the name you had for him:\u00a0Tony \u2764\ufe0f. You quickly closed out of it and swiped the contacts page off. Sighing and almost wanting to cry, you rushed to the cafeteria, grabbed a few things and went back to your dorm.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, phone placed in front of you, you spent the next hour and a half debating wether to call him or not. In the end you couldn\u2019t being yourself to do it so you decided that the better thing to do would be to suck it up and face him tomorrow.</p><p>You arrived a bit earlier than usual for class that morning, telling yourself over and over that this was just ridiculous and you were stupid for acting the way you were and how could you be such a coward. You also tried repeating a couple things over that you planned on telling him when he showed up. And then it happened.</p><p>You saw him enter the room wearing that one t-shirt you like so much on him and all your thoughts went out the door. Your mouth felt like it was now the Sahara Desert and your body felt like it became a two-by-four. Even your face felt flushed and hot.</p><p>When he saw you, his eyes immediately widened and went right over to you asking if everything was ok. You nodded, trying to have actual words come out. He could tell that something was going through your mind, so he sat down and gently pulled you down to the seat next to him. He was about to ask you what happened yesterday, while you were about to ask him who the girl was but the teacher walked in to have the class start. Questioning each other would have to wait.</p><p>The two of you silently worked through the lecture and when it came time for the class to work on the assignment the teacher gave out, Tony looked over at you and nudged your arm.</p><p>\u201cIs everything ok, [Y/N]? I tried calling and texting you last night but you didn\u2019t answer. I was really worried.\u201d<br></p><p>You looked at him and you could see that he really was worried but then wondered if this was all an act. You sucked in a breath and let it out.</p><p>\u201cEverything is ok. But I want to know something.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br></p><p>You couldn\u2019t believe you were going to say this but you knew that if you didn\u2019t, things would need to change between you two. Yet somehow you also knew that if your thoughts were confirmed on who this other girl was, things would still need to change.</p><p>\u201cI like you, Tony. Like a lot. Like, a\u00a0\u201cmore than a friend\u201d type thing. Do you like me that way too? Do you think we could be boyfriend and girlfriend?\u201d<br></p><p>Tony was a little surprised by what you said. But then he looked down, smiled a bit then looked back at you.</p><p>\u201cI already have a girlfriend, [Y/N]. I\u2019m sorry. But if you wanted to be my girlfriend, you should\u2019ve said something. I mean, I do like you. I really do. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all that flirting we were doing.. don\u2019t you think that should\u2019ve told you I wanted to be with you?\u201d<br></p><p>He sighed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not very good at reading signs of flirting. I need to have someone tell me that they like me in order for me to want to be with them.\u201d</p><p>You really couldn\u2019t believe what he was telling you. He seemed like he was a pro at the flirting game and then says that he\u2019s bad at reading the signs of it. Good gravy, this was all starting to unravel right here in your lap. You turned back to the assignment and started working on it.</p><p>\u201c[Y/N]\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>You put up a hand in front of his face and didn\u2019t look at him for the rest of the class. It was hard concentrating but you were doing the best you could. And when the bell rang, you silently and quickly gathered your things and walked out without a word to Tony.</p>",

The butterflies in your stomach were going in every direction possible which made it even that much harder to concentrate on what the teacher was saying and the assignment you had to then work on.</p><p>So, instead of working on the assignment you wrote out a note to Tony that you were going to hand him when class was over. But as soon as you were finished writing it, you reread it and crumpled it up, thinking it was the stupidest idea you\u2019ve had in years.</p><p>\u201c<i>What am I? In high school?</i>\u201d you thought.\u00a0\u201c<i>I should just be able to face him and talk to him. How is it that I\u2019m scared to do it though?</i>\u201d You folded your arms on the desk and placing your forehead on them you sighed, still not knowing what to do.</p>[[MORE]]<p>The bell rang and you started packing your things, watching Tony out of the corner of your eye. He acted as though there was no problem at all. He noticed you were acting a little distant this morning and went to ask you about it but you quickly grabbed your things and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>Going back to your dorm, you laid on the bed. You started thinking about all this flirting the two of you had been doing for the last several months and wondered if any of it was real. If all of it was just a game. If Tony even liked you that way. You grabbed your pillow and screamed into it.</p><p>At that point your phone started to ring which made you stop. Looking around for it and not seeing it anywhere on the nightstand or desk, you remembered you threw it in your purse. Fishing around for it and finding it buried underneath everything, you looked at it before the call ended.\u00a0\u201cTony\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u201d it read.</p><p>You flopped back down on the bed, phone still clutched in your hand. You just didn\u2019t know what to do. It rang again and again it was Tony. Placing the phone on the nightstand, you decided that you were going to stay in your room for the rest of the day. You weren\u2019t sure how you were going to face Tony about this but you know you had too.</p><p>Falling asleep, you had several dreams about him and all of them were about you and him being together. From hand holding to just cuddling each other, each dream was different from the next.</p><p>You woke up from having your stomach make the loudest noise, realizing you haven\u2019t eaten anything all day and it was somehow already 5 PM. Rubbing your eyes and hearing your stomach once again, you got up and looked in the mirror fixing your hair to make you look somewhat presentable to go to the cafeteria and grab something to eat.</p><p>Grabbing your phone, you pressed the button to wake it up and couldn\u2019t believe what your notifs looked like. Eight missed calls and 10 texts from Tony, along with three missed calls from your mom and six texts from her all asking the same thing: \u201c<i>why\u00a0aren\u2019t you answering?</i>\u201d, \u201c<i>is everything ok?</i>\u201d and \u201c<i>please call!</i>\u201d</p><p>As you walked over to the cafeteria, you called your mom and let her know that everything was fine and you just needed some time away from classes cuz you weren\u2019t feeling good. You didn\u2019t think that it would be a good idea to let your mom know that this \u201cfeeling\u201d\u00a0was about a boy because she didn\u2019t exactly approve of you having a boyfriend during school, which never made any sense to you since your sister was able to do that when she was in school and not get yelled at about it. But you brushed the thought out of your mind.</p><p>After you got off the phone with her, you hesitated to contact Tony and let him know that you were ok. Bringing up his contact info, your thumb ghosted over the screen while you stared at the name you had for him:\u00a0Tony \u2764\ufe0f. You quickly closed out of it and swiped the contacts page off. Sighing and almost wanting to cry, you rushed to the cafeteria, grabbed a few things and went back to your dorm.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, phone placed in front of you, you spent the next hour and a half debating wether to call him or not.

The butterflies in your stomach were going in every direction possible which made it even that much harder to concentrate on what the teacher was saying and the assignment you had to then work on.</p><p>So, instead of working on the assignment you wrote out a note to Tony that you were going to hand him when class was over. But as soon as you were finished writing it, you reread it and crumpled it up, thinking it was the stupidest idea you&rsquo;ve had in years.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>What am I? In high school?</i>&rdquo; you thought.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>I should just be able to face him and talk to him. How is it that I&rsquo;m scared to do it though?</i>&rdquo; You folded your arms on the desk and placing your forehead on them you sighed, still not knowing what to do.</p><p>The bell rang and you started packing your things, watching Tony out of the corner of your eye. He acted as though there was no problem at all. He noticed you were acting a little distant this morning and went to ask you about it but you quickly grabbed your things and walked out of the classroom.</p><p>Going back to your dorm, you laid on the bed. You started thinking about all this flirting the two of you had been doing for the last several months and wondered if any of it was real. If all of it was just a game. If Tony even liked you that way. You grabbed your pillow and screamed into it.</p><p>At that point your phone started to ring which made you stop. Looking around for it and not seeing it anywhere on the nightstand or desk, you remembered you threw it in your purse. Fishing around for it and finding it buried underneath everything, you looked at it before the call ended.&nbsp;&ldquo;Tony&nbsp;&#10084;&#65039;&rdquo; it read.</p><p>You flopped back down on the bed, phone still clutched in your hand. You just didn&rsquo;t know what to do. It rang again and again it was Tony. Placing the phone on the nightstand, you decided that you were going to stay in your room for the rest of the day. You weren&rsquo;t sure how you were going to face Tony about this but you know you had too.</p><p>Falling asleep, you had several dreams about him and all of them were about you and him being together. From hand holding to just cuddling each other, each dream was different from the next.</p><p>You woke up from having your stomach make the loudest noise, realizing you haven&rsquo;t eaten anything all day and it was somehow already 5 PM. Rubbing your eyes and hearing your stomach once again, you got up and looked in the mirror fixing your hair to make you look somewhat presentable to go to the cafeteria and grab something to eat.</p><p>Grabbing your phone, you pressed the button to wake it up and couldn&rsquo;t believe what your notifs looked like. Eight missed calls and 10 texts from Tony, along with three missed calls from your mom and six texts from her all asking the same thing: &ldquo;<i>why&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t you answering?</i>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<i>is everything ok?</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>please call!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>As you walked over to the cafeteria, you called your mom and let her know that everything was fine and you just needed some time away from classes cuz you weren&rsquo;t feeling good. You didn&rsquo;t think that it would be a good idea to let your mom know that this &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;&nbsp;was about a boy because she didn&rsquo;t exactly approve of you having a boyfriend during school, which never made any sense to you since your sister was able to do that when she was in school and not get yelled at about it. But you brushed the thought out of your mind.</p><p>After you got off the phone with her, you hesitated to contact Tony and let him know that you were ok. Bringing up his contact info, your thumb ghosted over the screen while you stared at the name you had for him:&nbsp;Tony &#10084;&#65039;. You quickly closed out of it and swiped the contacts page off. Sighing and almost wanting to cry, you rushed to the cafeteria, grabbed a few things and went back to your dorm.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, phone placed in front of you, you spent the next hour and a half debating wether to call him or not. In the end you couldn&rsquo;t being yourself to do it so you decided that the better thing to do would be to suck it up and face him tomorrow.</p><p>You arrived a bit earlier than usual for class that morning, telling yourself over and over that this was just ridiculous and you were stupid for acting the way you were and how could you be such a coward. You also tried repeating a couple things over that you planned on telling him when he showed up. And then it happened.</p><p>You saw him enter the room wearing that one t-shirt you like so much on him and all your thoughts went out the door. Your mouth felt like it was now the Sahara Desert and your body felt like it became a two-by-four. Even your face felt flushed and hot.</p><p>When he saw you, his eyes immediately widened and went right over to you asking if everything was ok. You nodded, trying to have actual words come out.

The butterflies in your stomach were going in every direction possible which made it even that much harder to concentrate on what the teacher was saying and the assignment you had to then work on.</p>\n<p>So, instead of working on the assignment you wrote out a note to Tony that you were going to hand him when class was over. But as soon as you were finished writing it, you reread it and crumpled it up, thinking it was the stupidest idea you&rsquo;ve had in years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<i>What am I? In high school?</i>&rdquo; you thought.&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>I should just be able to face him and talk to him. How is it that I&rsquo;m scared to do it though?</i>&rdquo; You folded your arms on the desk and placing your forehead on them you sighed, still not knowing what to do.</p>\n</p>",

eyes that burned with murderous\nfury. \u00a0The black gaping void of a mouth\nopened, the booming voice rumbling forth, sending shockwaves through the air\naround him.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you intrude upon my rest!\u201d it growled, a wave of\nhot foul breath slamming into Stephen, nearly knocking him down. \u00a0\u201cLeave at once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shook his head, curling his trembling hands into\nfists at his sides. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve come to ask\nyou for your amulet, Dormammu, and I won\u2019t leave until I get it.\u201d</p><p>The head warped and rippled, purple eyes blazing with\nindignation. \u00a0\u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll get\nfrom me is your death!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The words have\nnot yet finished ringing through the air as three long spikes rose up sharply\nfrom the ground underneath Stephen\u2019s feet, tearing through his body, spearing\nhim cruelly in place \u2013 a swift and brutal retribution for his reckless audacity.</p><!-- more --><p>***</p><p>The first wave of pain took him by surprise \u2013 a series of\nvicious, breath-robbing stabs that seemed to go straight through the center of\nhis arc reactor, folding him in half and dropping him to his knees.</p><p>It was over as quickly as it had begun, and he knelt there\nin wide-eyed misery, his free hand pressed firmly against his chest as he tried\nunsuccessfully to suck in a long, steady breath. \u00a0He felt a tingle in his other hand, and he\nglanced down at the amulet, frowning in apprehension as he watched the green\nlight emitted by the jewel at its center flicker once and then again, even as\nthe jewel itself grew suddenly, uncomfortably hot. \u00a0Then, just as abruptly, the heat dissipated,\nand the light returned to its steady rich glow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026,\u201d he gasped out, looking up at the Witch, \u201cwhat\nhappened? What does this mean?\u201d</p><p>She met his searching gaze calmly, a shrug of almost callous\nindifference tugging at her shoulders. \n\u201cHe was killed,\u201d she supplied, adding before Tony\u2019s horror-stunned mind\ncould even formulate a response, \u201cAnd then he was revived. \u00a0Just as I knew he would be.\u201d \u00a0She nodded at the amulet in Tony\u2019s hand,\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe as long as you keep this on you.\u201d \n</p><p>He blinked, absently rubbing his still aching chest. \u00a0\u201cSafe? You call this safe?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The Witch shrugged again. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be revived every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many times is that gonna be, huh?\u201d he challenged,\nsuddenly angry. \u00a0\u201cHow many times is he\ngoing to have to <i>die </i>for him to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Dormammu grows weary of repetition and gives him what\nhe asked for.\u201d \u00a0The Witch\u2019s gaze\nnarrowed, unsympathetic. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the only\nway for him to save you, human. \u00a0All <i>you</i> have to do is keep your fist\nclosed.\u201d</p><p>He reared back, bristling at her insinuation. \u00a0Gripped the amulet harder, opening his mouth\nto snap back a snarky retort. \u00a0But just\nthen another wave of pain hit, ripping through his body, tearing it apart piece\nby piece, and whatever he was about to say became lost in a hoarse moan of a\nscream.</p><p>***</p><p>It surprised him each time when he reappeared on Dormammu\u2019s\nplane alive and whole, every grotesque agonizing death \u2013 nothing but a vivid\nmemory. \u00a0It comforted him, too. \u00a0Because it meant that Tony was still there,\nstill holding on. \u00a0It gave him hope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no use,\u201d he rasped, his legs shaky as he stood tall\nonce more to Dormammu\u2019s outraged roar. \n\u201cI\u2019m stuck here with you until you give me what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Me. ALONE!!!\u201d \n</p><p>The earth around him shook and shuddered, his clothes\nwhipped about violently by the gale-like gust of a breath. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d he refused the moment he could pull air\nback into his lungs. \u00a0\u201cNot until you give\nme what I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you can keep this up?\u201d the creature\ntaunted, towering over Stephen\u2019s form. \n\u201cHow much more pain can you endure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that \u2013 a crooked, sad little thing that pulled\nat the corners of his lips, more a grimace than anything else. \u00a0\u201cPain\u2019s an old friend,\u201d he murmured, defiant,\nand squared his shoulders in preparation for more.</p><p>***</p><p>He must have passed out at one point, because he suddenly\nfound himself flat on his back on the cold cave floor with no memory of how he\ngot there. \u00a0There was something cold\nclasped around his right hand, an odd pressure pushing down on his fingers,\nforcing them to curl inward around some hard oval shape that was cutting into\nthe flesh of his palm.</p><p>He shifted, turning his head toward it, and barely\nrestrained a yelp of distress upon seeing the Witch crouched there next to his\noutstretched arm, mere inches away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he blurted out, foregoing all thought of eloquence\nas he struggled to bring his heart back to a less panicked rhythm.</p><p>\u201cYou fainted,\u201d the Witch explained dryly, her expression one\nof open accusation. \u00a0\u201cYou dropped the\namulet.\u201d</p><p>His heart jolted in panic \u2013 a painful jab against his\nribs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d </p><p>He fought to twist his arm out of the Witch\u2019s grasp, to look\nat the amulet. \u00a0He needed to see it,\nneeded to know if he had failed, if Stephen was\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky.\u201d \u00a0The\nWitch released his hand, and he yanked it toward him, turning it shakily palm\nup to see for himself. \u00a0\u201cThe amulet fell\nclose enough to you that I was able to use your own hand to reach it.\u201d</p><p>At his confused glance she clarified, \u201cThe spell relies on the\nconnection between the two of you. \u00a0If\nanyone else, including me, picks up the amulet, that connection <i>will </i>be severed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded numbly, digesting her words. \u00a0Pulled himself laboriously into a sitting\nposition. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d \u00a0The\njewel glowed a steady, reassuring green in the cup of his hand, still he\nwanted, <i>needed </i>to be sure.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d the Witch confirmed. \u00a0\u201cYou did not have it away from you for\nlong. \u00a0Like I said\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026lucky,\u201d he finished for her, his voice dull with a\nsobering realization. \u00a0He was getting\nweaker, and he knew it. \u00a0His body,\nalready severely taxed by the poison leaking from the reactor\u2019s palladium core,\nwas slowly but surely giving up. \u00a0He didn\u2019t\nknow how much longer he could endure before it failed him altogether. \u00a0And then he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to\nthe amulet, and Stephen would\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t last much longer,\u201d the Witch observed \u2013 a\nruthless echo of his own thoughts. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nyou may not get so lucky next time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, his brain churning as he desperately tried\nto think of something, <i>anything </i>to\nfix this. \u00a0His gaze landed on the\nrumpled, oil-stained sleeve of his Henley, and suddenly the solution appeared\nbefore him as clear as day, simple, so ridiculously simple \u2013 it almost made him\nlaugh out loud. \u00a0Almost.</p><p>He reached up toward the open vee of his shirt\u2019s placket, gripped\nboth sides as well as he could without relinquishing his hold on the amulet,\nand yanked. \u00a0Hard. \u00a0The fabric crackled as it ripped, the\nmaterial having been rent violently in two, and he shrugged quickly out of the\nleft sleeve, letting the ripped remains of his shirt slide down his right arm to\npool at his fisted hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-help me,\u201d he stammered out, struggling to wrap the\nmaterial around his right fist one-handed, his muscles trembling from weakness\nand the cold air of the cave that nipped against his now bare skin. \u00a0\u201cI need you to\u2026 t-tie it. \u00a0\u2018s tight as you c-can.\u201d</p><p>The Witch eyed him intently, something odd flickering in her\nexpression. \u00a0Then, wordlessly, she\nshifted closer, took the greased fabric from his shaking fingers. \u00a0\u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve surprised me,\nhuman,\u201d she admitted as she began wrapping the fabric tightly around his closed\nhand, something close to admiration in her quietly contemplative voice. \u00a0\u201cI did not think it possible.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wincing when she tied off the ends a little too\nroughly. \u00a0\u201cThanks\u2026. I guess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>And then he didn\u2019t say anything more. \u00a0Because that was when another wave of pain hit. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0</p><p>He swayed in place, gasping harshly as an invisible blade sliced\nthrough him again and again and again. \u00a0Careened\nto the side, collapsing feebly back onto the floor, his cheek pressing hard\ninto the cold, unforgiving stone. \u00a0</p><p>More pain ripped through him, spiking outwards from his arc\nreactor, and he gurgled breathlessly as something hot and viscous poured up his\nthroat, spilling into his mouth, dribbling past his cracked lips. \u00a0His chest twitched weakly in a useless\nattempt to draw air into his starving lungs, his vision graying from lack of\noxygen and constant, unbearable pain. \u00a0But even as\nhis eyelids fluttered to a close, their descent slow and inevitable, echoing\nthe faint halting beat of his dying heart, he smiled. \u00a0Because he could still see the blurry\noutlines of his wrapped hand lying on the floor in front of him. \u00a0Could still feel the pressure of the amulet\nagainst the inside of his palm and the occasional searing heat that spoke of\nStephen\u2019s continuous revival. \u00a0Because Stephen\nwould be okay\u2026. \u00a0</p>",

Witch had sent him into splintered, exploded\nsuddenly into a disorienting cacophony of flashing, whirling lights. \u00a0He staggered under the intensity of them,\nbringing his hand up to shield his eyes from the blinding flares. \u00a0And froze as a deafening roar filled his\nears.</p><p>The space before him buckled, twisted and warped, rippling\ninto a giant horned head with glowing purple eyes that burned with murderous\nfury. \u00a0The black gaping void of a mouth\nopened, the booming voice rumbling forth, sending shockwaves through the air\naround him.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you intrude upon my rest!\u201d it growled, a wave of\nhot foul breath slamming into Stephen, nearly knocking him down. \u00a0\u201cLeave at once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shook his head, curling his trembling hands into\nfists at his sides. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve come to ask\nyou for your amulet, Dormammu, and I won\u2019t leave until I get it.\u201d</p><p>The head warped and rippled, purple eyes blazing with\nindignation. \u00a0\u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll get\nfrom me is your death!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The words have\nnot yet finished ringing through the air as three long spikes rose up sharply\nfrom the ground underneath Stephen\u2019s feet, tearing through his body, spearing\nhim cruelly in place \u2013 a swift and brutal retribution for his reckless audacity.</p>[[MORE]]<p>***</p><p>The first wave of pain took him by surprise \u2013 a series of\nvicious, breath-robbing stabs that seemed to go straight through the center of\nhis arc reactor, folding him in half and dropping him to his knees.</p><p>It was over as quickly as it had begun, and he knelt there\nin wide-eyed misery, his free hand pressed firmly against his chest as he tried\nunsuccessfully to suck in a long, steady breath. \u00a0He felt a tingle in his other hand, and he\nglanced down at the amulet, frowning in apprehension as he watched the green\nlight emitted by the jewel at its center flicker once and then again, even as\nthe jewel itself grew suddenly, uncomfortably hot. \u00a0Then, just as abruptly, the heat dissipated,\nand the light returned to its steady rich glow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026,\u201d he gasped out, looking up at the Witch, \u201cwhat\nhappened? What does this mean?\u201d</p><p>She met his searching gaze calmly, a shrug of almost callous\nindifference tugging at her shoulders. \n\u201cHe was killed,\u201d she supplied, adding before Tony\u2019s horror-stunned mind\ncould even formulate a response, \u201cAnd then he was revived. \u00a0Just as I knew he would be.\u201d \u00a0She nodded at the amulet in Tony\u2019s hand,\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe as long as you keep this on you.\u201d \n</p><p>He blinked, absently rubbing his still aching chest. \u00a0\u201cSafe? You call this safe?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The Witch shrugged again. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be revived every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many times is that gonna be, huh?\u201d he challenged,\nsuddenly angry. \u00a0\u201cHow many times is he\ngoing to have to <i>die </i>for him to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Dormammu grows weary of repetition and gives him what\nhe asked for.\u201d \u00a0The Witch\u2019s gaze\nnarrowed, unsympathetic. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the only\nway for him to save you, human. \u00a0All <i>you</i> have to do is keep your fist\nclosed.\u201d</p><p>He reared back, bristling at her insinuation. \u00a0Gripped the amulet harder, opening his mouth\nto snap back a snarky retort. \u00a0But just\nthen another wave of pain hit, ripping through his body, tearing it apart piece\nby piece, and whatever he was about to say became lost in a hoarse moan of a\nscream.</p><p>***</p><p>It surprised him each time when he reappeared on Dormammu\u2019s\nplane alive and whole, every grotesque agonizing death \u2013 nothing but a vivid\nmemory. \u00a0It comforted him, too. \u00a0Because it meant that Tony was still there,\nstill holding on. \u00a0It gave him hope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no use,\u201d he rasped, his legs shaky as he stood tall\nonce more to Dormammu\u2019s outraged roar. \n\u201cI\u2019m stuck here with you until you give me what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Me. ALONE!!!\u201d \n</p><p>The earth around him shook and shuddered, his clothes\nwhipped about violently by the gale-like gust of a breath. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d he refused the moment he could pull air\nback into his lungs. \u00a0\u201cNot until you give\nme what I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you can keep this up?\u201d the creature\ntaunted, towering over Stephen\u2019s form. \n\u201cHow much more pain can you endure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that \u2013 a crooked, sad little thing that pulled\nat the corners of his lips, more a grimace than anything else. \u00a0\u201cPain\u2019s an old friend,\u201d he murmured, defiant,\nand squared his shoulders in preparation for more.</p><p>***</p><p>He must have passed out at one point, because he suddenly\nfound himself flat on his back on the cold cave floor with no memory of how he\ngot there. \u00a0There was something cold\nclasped around his right hand, an odd pressure pushing down on his fingers,\nforcing them to curl inward around some hard oval shape that was cutting into\nthe flesh of his palm.</p><p>He shifted, turning his head toward it, and barely\nrestrained a yelp of distress upon seeing the Witch crouched there next to his\noutstretched arm, mere inches away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he blurted out, foregoing all thought of eloquence\nas he struggled to bring his heart back to a less panicked rhythm.</p><p>\u201cYou fainted,\u201d the Witch explained dryly, her expression one\nof open accusation. \u00a0\u201cYou dropped the\namulet.\u201d</p><p>His heart jolted in panic \u2013 a painful jab against his\nribs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d </p><p>He fought to twist his arm out of the Witch\u2019s grasp, to look\nat the amulet. \u00a0He needed to see it,\nneeded to know if he had failed, if Stephen was\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky.\u201d \u00a0The\nWitch released his hand, and he yanked it toward him, turning it shakily palm\nup to see for himself. \u00a0\u201cThe amulet fell\nclose enough to you that I was able to use your own hand to reach it.\u201d</p><p>At his confused glance she clarified, \u201cThe spell relies on the\nconnection between the two of you. \u00a0If\nanyone else, including me, picks up the amulet, that connection <i>will </i>be severed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded numbly, digesting her words. \u00a0Pulled himself laboriously into a sitting\nposition. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d \u00a0The\njewel glowed a steady, reassuring green in the cup of his hand, still he\nwanted, <i>needed </i>to be sure.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d the Witch confirmed. \u00a0\u201cYou did not have it away from you for\nlong. \u00a0Like I said\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026lucky,\u201d he finished for her, his voice dull with a\nsobering realization. \u00a0He was getting\nweaker, and he knew it. \u00a0His body,\nalready severely taxed by the poison leaking from the reactor\u2019s palladium core,\nwas slowly but surely giving up. \u00a0He didn\u2019t\nknow how much longer he could endure before it failed him altogether. \u00a0And then he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to\nthe amulet, and Stephen would\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t last much longer,\u201d the Witch observed \u2013 a\nruthless echo of his own thoughts. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nyou may not get so lucky next time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, his brain churning as he desperately tried\nto think of something, <i>anything </i>to\nfix this. \u00a0His gaze landed on the\nrumpled, oil-stained sleeve of his Henley, and suddenly the solution appeared\nbefore him as clear as day, simple, so ridiculously simple \u2013 it almost made him\nlaugh out loud. \u00a0Almost.</p><p>He reached up toward the open vee of his shirt\u2019s placket, gripped\nboth sides as well as he could without relinquishing his hold on the amulet,\nand yanked. \u00a0Hard. \u00a0The fabric crackled as it ripped, the\nmaterial having been rent violently in two, and he shrugged quickly out of the\nleft sleeve, letting the ripped remains of his shirt slide down his right arm to\npool at his fisted hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-help me,\u201d he stammered out, struggling to wrap the\nmaterial around his right fist one-handed, his muscles trembling from weakness\nand the cold air of the cave that nipped against his now bare skin. \u00a0\u201cI need you to\u2026 t-tie it. \u00a0\u2018s tight as you c-can.\u201d</p><p>The Witch eyed him intently, something odd flickering in her\nexpression. \u00a0Then, wordlessly, she\nshifted closer, took the greased fabric from his shaking fingers. \u00a0\u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve surprised me,\nhuman,\u201d she admitted as she began wrapping the fabric tightly around his closed\nhand, something close to admiration in her quietly contemplative voice. \u00a0\u201cI did not think it possible.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wincing when she tied off the ends a little too\nroughly. \u00a0\u201cThanks\u2026. I guess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>And then he didn\u2019t say anything more. \u00a0Because that was when another wave of pain hit. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0</p><p>He swayed in place, gasping harshly as an invisible blade sliced\nthrough him again and again and again. \u00a0Careened\nto the side, collapsing feebly back onto the floor, his cheek pressing hard\ninto the cold, unforgiving stone. \u00a0</p><p>More pain ripped through him, spiking outwards from his arc\nreactor, and he gurgled breathlessly as something hot and viscous poured up his\nthroat, spilling into his mouth, dribbling past his cracked lips. \u00a0His chest twitched weakly in a useless\nattempt to draw air into his starving lungs, his vision graying from lack of\noxygen and constant, unbearable pain. \u00a0But even as\nhis eyelids fluttered to a close, their descent slow and inevitable, echoing\nthe faint halting beat of his dying heart, he smiled. \u00a0Because he could still see the blurry\noutlines of his wrapped hand lying on the floor in front of him. \u00a0Could still feel the pressure of the amulet\nagainst the inside of his palm and the occasional searing heat that spoke of\nStephen\u2019s continuous revival. \u00a0Because Stephen\nwould be okay\u2026. \u00a0</p>",

Witch had sent him into splintered, exploded\nsuddenly into a disorienting cacophony of flashing, whirling lights. \u00a0He staggered under the intensity of them,\nbringing his hand up to shield his eyes from the blinding flares. \u00a0And froze as a deafening roar filled his\nears.</p><p>The space before him buckled, twisted and warped, rippling\ninto a giant horned head with glowing purple eyes that burned with murderous\nfury. \u00a0The black gaping void of a mouth\nopened, the booming voice rumbling forth, sending shockwaves through the air\naround him.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you intrude upon my rest!\u201d it growled, a wave of\nhot foul breath slamming into Stephen, nearly knocking him down. \u00a0\u201cLeave at once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he shook his head, curling his trembling hands into\nfists at his sides. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve come to ask\nyou for your amulet, Dormammu, and I won\u2019t leave until I get it.\u201d</p><p>The head warped and rippled, purple eyes blazing with\nindignation. \u00a0\u201cThe only thing you\u2019ll get\nfrom me is your death!\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The words have\nnot yet finished ringing through the air as three long spikes rose up sharply\nfrom the ground underneath Stephen\u2019s feet, tearing through his body, spearing\nhim cruelly in place \u2013 a swift and brutal retribution for his reckless audacity.</p>[[MORE]]<p>***</p><p>The first wave of pain took him by surprise \u2013 a series of\nvicious, breath-robbing stabs that seemed to go straight through the center of\nhis arc reactor, folding him in half and dropping him to his knees.</p><p>It was over as quickly as it had begun, and he knelt there\nin wide-eyed misery, his free hand pressed firmly against his chest as he tried\nunsuccessfully to suck in a long, steady breath. \u00a0He felt a tingle in his other hand, and he\nglanced down at the amulet, frowning in apprehension as he watched the green\nlight emitted by the jewel at its center flicker once and then again, even as\nthe jewel itself grew suddenly, uncomfortably hot. \u00a0Then, just as abruptly, the heat dissipated,\nand the light returned to its steady rich glow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2026,\u201d he gasped out, looking up at the Witch, \u201cwhat\nhappened? What does this mean?\u201d</p><p>She met his searching gaze calmly, a shrug of almost callous\nindifference tugging at her shoulders. \n\u201cHe was killed,\u201d she supplied, adding before Tony\u2019s horror-stunned mind\ncould even formulate a response, \u201cAnd then he was revived. \u00a0Just as I knew he would be.\u201d \u00a0She nodded at the amulet in Tony\u2019s hand,\n\u201cHe\u2019s safe as long as you keep this on you.\u201d \n</p><p>He blinked, absently rubbing his still aching chest. \u00a0\u201cSafe? You call this safe?\u201d \u00a0</p><p>The Witch shrugged again. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be revived every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many times is that gonna be, huh?\u201d he challenged,\nsuddenly angry. \u00a0\u201cHow many times is he\ngoing to have to <i>die </i>for him to\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Dormammu grows weary of repetition and gives him what\nhe asked for.\u201d \u00a0The Witch\u2019s gaze\nnarrowed, unsympathetic. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the only\nway for him to save you, human. \u00a0All <i>you</i> have to do is keep your fist\nclosed.\u201d</p><p>He reared back, bristling at her insinuation. \u00a0Gripped the amulet harder, opening his mouth\nto snap back a snarky retort. \u00a0But just\nthen another wave of pain hit, ripping through his body, tearing it apart piece\nby piece, and whatever he was about to say became lost in a hoarse moan of a\nscream.</p><p>***</p><p>It surprised him each time when he reappeared on Dormammu\u2019s\nplane alive and whole, every grotesque agonizing death \u2013 nothing but a vivid\nmemory. \u00a0It comforted him, too. \u00a0Because it meant that Tony was still there,\nstill holding on. \u00a0It gave him hope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s of no use,\u201d he rasped, his legs shaky as he stood tall\nonce more to Dormammu\u2019s outraged roar. \n\u201cI\u2019m stuck here with you until you give me what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave. Me. ALONE!!!\u201d \n</p><p>The earth around him shook and shuddered, his clothes\nwhipped about violently by the gale-like gust of a breath. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d he refused the moment he could pull air\nback into his lungs. \u00a0\u201cNot until you give\nme what I want.\u201d </p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you can keep this up?\u201d the creature\ntaunted, towering over Stephen\u2019s form. \n\u201cHow much more pain can you endure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that \u2013 a crooked, sad little thing that pulled\nat the corners of his lips, more a grimace than anything else. \u00a0\u201cPain\u2019s an old friend,\u201d he murmured, defiant,\nand squared his shoulders in preparation for more.</p><p>***</p><p>He must have passed out at one point, because he suddenly\nfound himself flat on his back on the cold cave floor with no memory of how he\ngot there. \u00a0There was something cold\nclasped around his right hand, an odd pressure pushing down on his fingers,\nforcing them to curl inward around some hard oval shape that was cutting into\nthe flesh of his palm.</p><p>He shifted, turning his head toward it, and barely\nrestrained a yelp of distress upon seeing the Witch crouched there next to his\noutstretched arm, mere inches away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he blurted out, foregoing all thought of eloquence\nas he struggled to bring his heart back to a less panicked rhythm.</p><p>\u201cYou fainted,\u201d the Witch explained dryly, her expression one\nof open accusation. \u00a0\u201cYou dropped the\namulet.\u201d</p><p>His heart jolted in panic \u2013 a painful jab against his\nribs. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cStephen?\u201d </p><p>He fought to twist his arm out of the Witch\u2019s grasp, to look\nat the amulet. \u00a0He needed to see it,\nneeded to know if he had failed, if Stephen was\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky.\u201d \u00a0The\nWitch released his hand, and he yanked it toward him, turning it shakily palm\nup to see for himself. \u00a0\u201cThe amulet fell\nclose enough to you that I was able to use your own hand to reach it.\u201d</p><p>At his confused glance she clarified, \u201cThe spell relies on the\nconnection between the two of you. \u00a0If\nanyone else, including me, picks up the amulet, that connection <i>will </i>be severed.\u201d</p><p>He nodded numbly, digesting her words. \u00a0Pulled himself laboriously into a sitting\nposition. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s okay?\u201d \u00a0The\njewel glowed a steady, reassuring green in the cup of his hand, still he\nwanted, <i>needed </i>to be sure.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d the Witch confirmed. \u00a0\u201cYou did not have it away from you for\nlong. \u00a0Like I said\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026lucky,\u201d he finished for her, his voice dull with a\nsobering realization. \u00a0He was getting\nweaker, and he knew it. \u00a0His body,\nalready severely taxed by the poison leaking from the reactor\u2019s palladium core,\nwas slowly but surely giving up. \u00a0He didn\u2019t\nknow how much longer he could endure before it failed him altogether. \u00a0And then he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to\nthe amulet, and Stephen would\u2026</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t last much longer,\u201d the Witch observed \u2013 a\nruthless echo of his own thoughts. \u00a0\u201cAnd\nyou may not get so lucky next time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, his brain churning as he desperately tried\nto think of something, <i>anything </i>to\nfix this. \u00a0His gaze landed on the\nrumpled, oil-stained sleeve of his Henley, and suddenly the solution appeared\nbefore him as clear as day, simple, so ridiculously simple \u2013 it almost made him\nlaugh out loud. \u00a0Almost.</p><p>He reached up toward the open vee of his shirt\u2019s placket, gripped\nboth sides as well as he could without relinquishing his hold on the amulet,\nand yanked. \u00a0Hard. \u00a0The fabric crackled as it ripped, the\nmaterial having been rent violently in two, and he shrugged quickly out of the\nleft sleeve, letting the ripped remains of his shirt slide down his right arm to\npool at his fisted hand. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cH-help me,\u201d he stammered out, struggling to wrap the\nmaterial around his right fist one-handed, his muscles trembling from weakness\nand the cold air of the cave that nipped against his now bare skin. \u00a0\u201cI need you to\u2026 t-tie it. \u00a0\u2018s tight as you c-can.\u201d</p><p>The Witch eyed him intently, something odd flickering in her\nexpression. \u00a0Then, wordlessly, she\nshifted closer, took the greased fabric from his shaking fingers. \u00a0\u201cThis is the second time you\u2019ve surprised me,\nhuman,\u201d she admitted as she began wrapping the fabric tightly around his closed\nhand, something close to admiration in her quietly contemplative voice. \u00a0\u201cI did not think it possible.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, wincing when she tied off the ends a little too\nroughly. \u00a0\u201cThanks\u2026. I guess.\u201d \u00a0</p><p>And then he didn\u2019t say anything more. \u00a0Because that was when another wave of pain hit. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0And then another. \u00a0</p><p>He swayed in place, gasping harshly as an invisible blade sliced\nthrough him again and again and again. \u00a0Careened\nto the side, collapsing feebly back onto the floor, his cheek pressing hard\ninto the cold, unforgiving stone. \u00a0</p><p>More pain ripped through him, spiking outwards from his arc\nreactor, and he gurgled breathlessly as something hot and viscous poured up his\nthroat, spilling into his mouth, dribbling past his cracked lips. \u00a0His chest twitched weakly in a useless\nattempt to draw air into his starving lungs, his vision graying from lack of\noxygen and constant, unbearable pain. \u00a0But even as\nhis eyelids fluttered to a close, their descent slow and inevitable, echoing\nthe faint halting beat of his dying heart, he smiled. \u00a0Because he could still see the blurry\noutlines of his wrapped hand lying on the floor in front of him. \u00a0Could still feel the pressure of the amulet\nagainst the inside of his palm and the occasional searing heat that spoke of\nStephen\u2019s continuous revival. \u00a0Because Stephen\nwould be okay\u2026. \u00a0</p>",

it growled, a wave of\nhot foul breath slamming into Stephen, nearly knocking him down. &nbsp;&ldquo;Leave at once!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he shook his head, curling his trembling hands into\nfists at his sides. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to ask\nyou for your amulet, Dormammu, and I won&rsquo;t leave until I get it.&rdquo;</p><p>The head warped and rippled, purple eyes blazing with\nindignation. &nbsp;&ldquo;The only thing you&rsquo;ll get\nfrom me is your death!&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The words have\nnot yet finished ringing through the air as three long spikes rose up sharply\nfrom the ground underneath Stephen&rsquo;s feet, tearing through his body, spearing\nhim cruelly in place &ndash; a swift and brutal retribution for his reckless audacity.</p><p>***</p><p>The first wave of pain took him by surprise &ndash; a series of\nvicious, breath-robbing stabs that seemed to go straight through the center of\nhis arc reactor, folding him in half and dropping him to his knees.</p><p>It was over as quickly as it had begun, and he knelt there\nin wide-eyed misery, his free hand pressed firmly against his chest as he tried\nunsuccessfully to suck in a long, steady breath. &nbsp;He felt a tingle in his other hand, and he\nglanced down at the amulet, frowning in apprehension as he watched the green\nlight emitted by the jewel at its center flicker once and then again, even as\nthe jewel itself grew suddenly, uncomfortably hot. &nbsp;Then, just as abruptly, the heat dissipated,\nand the light returned to its steady rich glow.</p><p>&ldquo;What&hellip;,&rdquo; he gasped out, looking up at the Witch, &ldquo;what\nhappened? What does this mean?&rdquo;</p><p>She met his searching gaze calmly, a shrug of almost callous\nindifference tugging at her shoulders. \n&ldquo;He was killed,&rdquo; she supplied, adding before Tony&rsquo;s horror-stunned mind\ncould even formulate a response, &ldquo;And then he was revived. &nbsp;Just as I knew he would be.&rdquo; &nbsp;She nodded at the amulet in Tony&rsquo;s hand,\n&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe as long as you keep this on you.&rdquo; \n</p><p>He blinked, absently rubbing his still aching chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;Safe? You call this safe?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>The Witch shrugged again. \n&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be revived every time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how many times is that gonna be, huh?&rdquo; he challenged,\nsuddenly angry. &nbsp;&ldquo;How many times is he\ngoing to have to <i>die </i>for him to&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Until Dormammu grows weary of repetition and gives him what\nhe asked for.&rdquo; &nbsp;The Witch&rsquo;s gaze\nnarrowed, unsympathetic. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only\nway for him to save you, human. &nbsp;All <i>you</i> have to do is keep your fist\nclosed.&rdquo;</p><p>He reared back, bristling at her insinuation. &nbsp;Gripped the amulet harder, opening his mouth\nto snap back a snarky retort. &nbsp;But just\nthen another wave of pain hit, ripping through his body, tearing it apart piece\nby piece, and whatever he was about to say became lost in a hoarse moan of a\nscream.</p><p>***</p><p>It surprised him each time when he reappeared on Dormammu&rsquo;s\nplane alive and whole, every grotesque agonizing death &ndash; nothing but a vivid\nmemory. &nbsp;It comforted him, too. &nbsp;Because it meant that Tony was still there,\nstill holding on. &nbsp;It gave him hope.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use,&rdquo; he rasped, his legs shaky as he stood tall\nonce more to Dormammu&rsquo;s outraged roar. \n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck here with you until you give me what I want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave. Me. ALONE!!!&rdquo; \n</p><p>The earth around him shook and shuddered, his clothes\nwhipped about violently by the gale-like gust of a breath. &nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he refused the moment he could pull air\nback into his lungs. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not until you give\nme what I want.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;How long do you think you can keep this up?&rdquo; the creature\ntaunted, towering over Stephen&rsquo;s form. \n&ldquo;How much more pain can you endure?&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled at that &ndash; a crooked, sad little thing that pulled\nat the corners of his lips, more a grimace than anything else. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pain&rsquo;s an old friend,&rdquo; he murmured, defiant,\nand squared his shoulders in preparation for more.</p><p>***</p><p>He must have passed out at one point, because he suddenly\nfound himself flat on his back on the cold cave floor with no memory of how he\ngot there. &nbsp;There was something cold\nclasped around his right hand, an odd pressure pushing down on his fingers,\nforcing them to curl inward around some hard oval shape that was cutting into\nthe flesh of his palm.</p><p>He shifted, turning his head toward it, and barely\nrestrained a yelp of distress upon seeing the Witch crouched there next to his\noutstretched arm, mere inches away.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he blurted out, foregoing all thought of eloquence\nas he struggled to bring his heart back to a less panicked rhythm.</p><p>&ldquo;You fainted,&rdquo; the Witch explained dryly, her expression one\nof open accusation. &nbsp;&ldquo;You dropped the\namulet.&rdquo;</p><p>His heart jolted in panic &ndash; a painful jab against his\nribs. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stephen?&rdquo; </p><p>He fought to twist his arm out of the Witch&rsquo;s grasp, to look\nat the amulet. &nbsp;He needed to see it,\nneeded to know if he had failed, if Stephen was&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You got lucky.&rdquo; &nbsp;The\nWitch released his hand, and he yanked it toward him, turning it shakily palm\nup to see for himself. &nbsp;&ldquo;The amulet fell\nclose enough to you that I was able to use your own hand to reach it.&rdquo;</p><p>At his confused glance she clarified, &ldquo;The spell relies on the\nconnection between the two of you. &nbsp;If\nanyone else, including me, picks up the amulet, that connection <i>will </i>be severed.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded numbly, digesting her words. &nbsp;Pulled himself laboriously into a sitting\nposition. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; &nbsp;The\njewel glowed a steady, reassuring green in the cup of his hand, still he\nwanted, <i>needed </i>to be sure.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; the Witch confirmed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You did not have it away from you for\nlong. &nbsp;Like I said&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&hellip;lucky,&rdquo; he finished for her, his voice dull with a\nsobering realization. &nbsp;He was getting\nweaker, and he knew it. &nbsp;His body,\nalready severely taxed by the poison leaking from the reactor&rsquo;s palladium core,\nwas slowly but surely giving up. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t\nknow how much longer he could endure before it failed him altogether. &nbsp;And then he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold on to\nthe amulet, and Stephen would&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t last much longer,&rdquo; the Witch observed &ndash; a\nruthless echo of his own thoughts. &nbsp;&ldquo;And\nyou may not get so lucky next time.&rdquo;</p><p>He nodded again, his brain churning as he desperately tried\nto think of something, <i>anything </i>to\nfix this. &nbsp;His gaze landed on the\nrumpled, oil-stained sleeve of his Henley, and suddenly the solution appeared\nbefore him as clear as day, simple, so ridiculously simple &ndash; it almost made him\nlaugh out loud. &nbsp;Almost.</p><p>He reached up toward the open vee of his shirt&rsquo;s placket, gripped\nboth sides as well as he could without relinquishing his hold on the amulet,\nand yanked. &nbsp;Hard. &nbsp;The fabric crackled as it ripped, the\nmaterial having been rent violently in two, and he shrugged quickly out of the\nleft sleeve, letting the ripped remains of his shirt slide down his right arm to\npool at his fisted hand. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;H-help me,&rdquo; he stammered out, struggling to wrap the\nmaterial around his right fist one-handed, his muscles trembling from weakness\nand the cold air of the cave that nipped against his now bare skin. &nbsp;&ldquo;I need you to&hellip; t-tie it. &nbsp;&lsquo;s tight as you c-can.&rdquo;</p><p>The Witch eyed him intently, something odd flickering in her\nexpression. &nbsp;Then, wordlessly, she\nshifted closer, took the greased fabric from his shaking fingers. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is the second time you&rsquo;ve surprised me,\nhuman,&rdquo; she admitted as she began wrapping the fabric tightly around his closed\nhand, something close to admiration in her quietly contemplative voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;I did not think it possible.&rdquo;</p><p>He shrugged, wincing when she tied off the ends a little too\nroughly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks&hellip;. I guess.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>And then he didn&rsquo;t say anything more. &nbsp;Because that was when another wave of pain hit. &nbsp;And then another. &nbsp;And then another. &nbsp;</p><p>He swayed in place, gasping harshly as an invisible blade sliced\nthrough him again and again and again. &nbsp;Careened\nto the side, collapsing feebly back onto the floor, his cheek pressing hard\ninto the cold, unforgiving stone. &nbsp;</p><p>More pain ripped through him, spiking outwards from his arc\nreactor, and he gurgled breathlessly as something hot and viscous poured up his\nthroat, spilling into his mouth, dribbling past his cracked lips. &nbsp;His chest twitched weakly in a useless\nattempt to draw air into his starving lungs, his vision graying from lack of\noxygen and constant, unbearable pain. &nbsp;But even as\nhis eyelids fluttered to a close, their descent slow and inevitable, echoing\nthe faint halting beat of his dying heart, he smiled. &nbsp;Because he could still see the blurry\noutlines of his wrapped hand lying on the floor in front of him. &nbsp;Could still feel the pressure of the amulet\nagainst the inside of his palm and the occasional searing heat that spoke of\nStephen&rsquo;s continuous revival. &nbsp;Because Stephen\nwould be okay&hellip;. &nbsp;</p>",

Peter sits on the other side of the room on the table, keeping you company. In his lap, he has a bowl of popcorn because all he does is eat. You pick up a few tools and tweak and enhance parts of the iron suit. You hear the lab doors open with a hiss and turn to see your dad walking up towards a suit that you\u2019re not working on.</p><p>\u201cHey, dad. Where you off to?\u201d You ask while your attention is still on the metal suit in front of you.</p><p>\u201cJust a quick mission, nothing major. Won\u2019t be long and thank you for enhancing my suit, you are indeed my daughter.\u201d He says with a smile while pointing at the suit that is half deconstructed.</p><p>You smile up at your father with love and adoration. You see him get into his suit, Peter still watching in amazement even though he has seen it many times before. Tony walks off the platform his suit was on and walks towards you. His mask unfolds to reveal his face. He plants a soft kiss on your forehead before saying.</p><p>\u201cBye, kid. Don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d He says before turning around and giving Peter a high five. The roof opens and your dad shoots into the sky, saving the day. You leave the roof open to look at the stars and to let a breeze in.</p><p>You wish to be like your dad, brave, selfless, strong. You wish to be an Avenger, but your dad told you that you can when you make your own suit. You\u2019re broken out of your thoughts by Peter\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get more popcorn, babe.\u201d He says before exiting the lab to get more snacks. You focus your attention on the suit in front of you. You pick up the screwdriver and tighten the new board that you\u2019ve made. Little did you know that it activated. You turn around, with your back towards the suit to pick up another tool when suddenly a metal hand clamps down on your wrist and shoots up into the sky. Leaving you dangling with no protection.</p><p>A scream leaves your lips, the cold air piercing your skin and the adrenaline rushing through your veins. You look down, bad choice, to see the ground get smaller and smaller. Your body fills with panic and dread, you prepare yourself for death, thinking about your loved ones, Tony, Steve, Natasha, Bucky even though you\u2019re supposed to hate him you see him as your big, brainwashed, brother. You think of Peter, your boyfriend, someone you love so dearly and unconditionally.</p><p>You feel tears stream down your cheeks but turn to ice at the temperature drop from so high up. All you can do is hang there. The hand still gripping your wrist painfully tight. Suddenly the hand lets go and you panic, you grab onto the foot of the suit. Your heart almost coming out your throat. You have a small sense of relief but are still panicked because you have no idea how you\u2019re going to make out of this alive.</p><p>Your thoughts are broken by a voice telling you to let go, you hear it come from the suit and recognise it as your dad\u2019s, without hesitation you let go and you feel yourself falling to your death. Your stomach in your through and the feeling of air slipping through your limbs as you flail around, wondering why your dad told you to let go.</p><p>You look around the empty sky to try and find your dad, you see him shooting towards you, his hand reaches out to you to try and grab you but misses and you\u2019re still falling to your death. You hear him scream \u201cNo!\u201d but it\u2019s too late, there is no way that he can get to you in time, but he still tries, not letting the thought of you dying get to him. You accept the fact that you\u2019re going to die, seeing the buildings getting bigger and bigger as you near the earth\u2019s surface.</p><p>Suddenly you feel a wet sticky substance on your hands. You\u2019re suddenly jerked to a stop. You feel your arm being yanked out if it\u2019s socket, but you don\u2019t feel anything due to the fear and panic coursing through you. You see a red and blue suit slowly pulling you up by the web stuck to you. The realisation of who it is makes you burst into hysterics. The tears roll down your face at the sight of your boyfriend, thinking that you wouldn\u2019t be able to see him again.</p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d His soothing voice making way to your ears, calming you slightly. Peter eventually pulls you all the way up and you fall in his arms, your body cold and shaking. You bury your head on his neck, savouring the time you have on the solid ground. Peter\u2019s arms wrap around you, holding you close to him, reassuring you that you\u2019re okay. He moves his arms and one presses against your dislocated shoulder. You wince, and Peter slowly pulls back, inspecting you. He sees your misaligned shoulder and his eyes soften at your pain. He fills up with guilty because he knows that was what happened when he stopped you with his web.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is all my fault.\u201d He apologizes.</p><p>\u201cI would rather have a dislocated shoulder than be dead so.\u201d You say, drying your eyes with the non-injured hand.</p><p>You feel the building top shake lightly, you see that your dad has landed and is making his way out of his suit. He rushes towards you with worry etched on his face. You run towards him, tears brimming your eyes and his. He wraps his arms around you and holds you tight, you feel the pain in your shoulder but ignore it, embracing your dad as best as you can.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you.\u201d He whispers in your hair, tears streaming down his face. Stroking your hair and kissing your head every now and then. You hold him close to you, relishing in the warmth of his body and the sent that you will always remind you of him. Tony slowly pulls away and looks at Peter, he walks towards him, Peter looking a little scared, having no idea what is about to happen. Before Peter could comprehend your dad tackles him in a bone crushing hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for saving her.\u201d He says in his ear. You see Peter\u2019s arms wrap around your dad. You break the hug short because the pain in your shoulder is becoming unbearable.</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry to cut this short but I need to get this shoulder sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Your dad breaks away and looks at you confused. He looks to your shoulder and sees it not where it should be.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he says shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhen Peter caught me my stopped suddenly so my shoulder got dislocated.\u201d You explain calmly. You see Peter tense, wondering if your dad was going to come at him for hurting you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would rather you have a dislocated shoulder than be dead.\u201d He says, you see Peter relax slightly.</p><p>Like father light daughter.</p>",

You have a small sense of relief but are still panicked because you have no idea how you\u2019re going to make out of this alive.</p><p>Your thoughts are broken by a voice telling you to let go, you hear it come from the suit and recognise it as your dad\u2019s, without hesitation you let go and you feel yourself falling to your death. Your stomach in your through and the feeling of air slipping through your limbs as you flail around, wondering why your dad told you to let go.</p><p>You look around the empty sky to try and find your dad, you see him shooting towards you, his hand reaches out to you to try and grab you but misses and you\u2019re still falling to your death. You hear him scream \u201cNo!\u201d but it\u2019s too late, there is no way that he can get to you in time, but he still tries, not letting the thought of you dying get to him. You accept the fact that you\u2019re going to die, seeing the buildings getting bigger and bigger as you near the earth\u2019s surface.</p><p>Suddenly you feel a wet sticky substance on your hands. You\u2019re suddenly jerked to a stop. You feel your arm being yanked out if it\u2019s socket, but you don\u2019t feel anything due to the fear and panic coursing through you. You see a red and blue suit slowly pulling you up by the web stuck to you. The realisation of who it is makes you burst into hysterics. The tears roll down your face at the sight of your boyfriend, thinking that you wouldn\u2019t be able to see him again.</p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d His soothing voice making way to your ears, calming you slightly. Peter eventually pulls you all the way up and you fall in his arms, your body cold and shaking. You bury your head on his neck, savouring the time you have on the solid ground. Peter\u2019s arms wrap around you, holding you close to him, reassuring you that you\u2019re okay. He moves his arms and one presses against your dislocated shoulder. You wince, and Peter slowly pulls back, inspecting you. He sees your misaligned shoulder and his eyes soften at your pain. He fills up with guilty because he knows that was what happened when he stopped you with his web.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is all my fault.\u201d He apologizes.</p><p>\u201cI would rather have a dislocated shoulder than be dead so.\u201d You say, drying your eyes with the non-injured hand.</p><p>You feel the building top shake lightly, you see that your dad has landed and is making his way out of his suit. He rushes towards you with worry etched on his face. You run towards him, tears brimming your eyes and his. He wraps his arms around you and holds you tight, you feel the pain in your shoulder but ignore it, embracing your dad as best as you can.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you.\u201d He whispers in your hair, tears streaming down his face. Stroking your hair and kissing your head every now and then. You hold him close to you, relishing in the warmth of his body and the sent that you will always remind you of him. Tony slowly pulls away and looks at Peter, he walks towards him, Peter looking a little scared, having no idea what is about to happen. Before Peter could comprehend your dad tackles him in a bone crushing hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for saving her.\u201d He says in his ear. You see Peter\u2019s arms wrap around your dad. You break the hug short because the pain in your shoulder is becoming unbearable.</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry to cut this short but I need to get this shoulder sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Your dad breaks away and looks at you confused. He looks to your shoulder and sees it not where it should be.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he says shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhen Peter caught me my stopped suddenly so my shoulder got dislocated.\u201d You explain calmly. You see Peter tense, wondering if your dad was going to come at him for hurting you.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would rather you have a dislocated shoulder than be dead.\u201d He says, you see Peter relax slightly.</p><p>Like father light daughter.</p></p>",

Peter sits on the other side of the room on the table, keeping you company. In his lap, he has a bowl of popcorn because all he does is eat. You pick up a few tools and tweak and enhance parts of the iron suit. You hear the lab doors open with a hiss and turn to see your dad walking up towards a suit that you&rsquo;re not working on.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, dad. Where you off to?&rdquo; You ask while your attention is still on the metal suit in front of you.</p><p>&ldquo;Just a quick mission, nothing major. Won&rsquo;t be long and thank you for enhancing my suit, you are indeed my daughter.&rdquo; He says with a smile while pointing at the suit that is half deconstructed.</p><p>You smile up at your father with love and adoration. You see him get into his suit, Peter still watching in amazement even though he has seen it many times before. Tony walks off the platform his suit was on and walks towards you. His mask unfolds to reveal his face. He plants a soft kiss on your forehead before saying.</p><p>&ldquo;Bye, kid. Don&rsquo;t stay up too late.&rdquo; He says before turning around and giving Peter a high five. The roof opens and your dad shoots into the sky, saving the day. You leave the roof open to look at the stars and to let a breeze in.</p><p>You wish to be like your dad, brave, selfless, strong. You wish to be an Avenger, but your dad told you that you can when you make your own suit. You&rsquo;re broken out of your thoughts by Peter&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get more popcorn, babe.&rdquo; He says before exiting the lab to get more snacks. You focus your attention on the suit in front of you. You pick up the screwdriver and tighten the new board that you&rsquo;ve made. Little did you know that it activated. You turn around, with your back towards the suit to pick up another tool when suddenly a metal hand clamps down on your wrist and shoots up into the sky. Leaving you dangling with no protection.</p><p>A scream leaves your lips, the cold air piercing your skin and the adrenaline rushing through your veins. You look down, bad choice, to see the ground get smaller and smaller. Your body fills with panic and dread, you prepare yourself for death, thinking about your loved ones, Tony, Steve, Natasha, Bucky even though you&rsquo;re supposed to hate him you see him as your big, brainwashed, brother. You think of Peter, your boyfriend, someone you love so dearly and unconditionally.</p><p>You feel tears stream down your cheeks but turn to ice at the temperature drop from so high up. All you can do is hang there. The hand still gripping your wrist painfully tight. Suddenly the hand lets go and you panic, you grab onto the foot of the suit. Your heart almost coming out your throat. You have a small sense of relief but are still panicked because you have no idea how you&rsquo;re going to make out of this alive.</p><p>Your thoughts are broken by a voice telling you to let go, you hear it come from the suit and recognise it as your dad&rsquo;s, without hesitation you let go and you feel yourself falling to your death.
