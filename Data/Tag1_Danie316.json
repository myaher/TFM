And since then, they had been receiving multiple letters a day. Even with the police watching the apartment, this maniac was still able to slip multiple letters a day, plus pictures of Phil leaving the police station the other day under their door.<br/></p><p>The police couldn&rsquo;t answer how the letters were still getting to them, but they assured Phil that they were perfectly safe as long as they stayed in their apartment. Phil had scoffed when Luke had told him this. At this point, he had lost all his faith in the police. If they couldn&rsquo;t even keep a proper watch on their front door, how in the world were they supposed to be trusted to keep them safe? \u00a0</p><p>When Phil had informed them that Dan&rsquo;s family was coming to visit, they weren&rsquo;t too happy. Truth be told Phil, wasn&rsquo;t very happy about it either. They had all but invited themselves even after Phil tried telling them that Dan was just settling back at home and trying to recover. He didn&rsquo;t mention the letters to them either, so as far as they were concerned, the danger was over.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s family even had to go through a whole search before they had been permitted to come up to their apartment. \u00a0</p><p>Dan currently sat in the middle of the living room in his Winnie the Pooh onesie, playing with his toys. Phil was trying to balance several teacups in his uninjured hand and carry them to the living room. Cursing himself he realized he had forgotten the sugar. He hauled the tray back into the kitchen to grab it. Just before he re-entered the living room, he heard hushed voices.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Daniel, this is ridiculous!. Stop acting like a child.&rdquo;</i></b> Phil heard Dan&rsquo;s mother hiss at him.</p><p>Phil stopped in the doorway to listen.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </b></i>a very confused Dan questioned in his little voice. \u00a0</p><p>His father angrily whispered, <b><i>&ldquo;I understand you went through a traumatic ordeal, but why do you have to act like this ?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Not letting this go any further, Phil quickly entered the living room and set the tray down on the coffee table. It&rsquo;s a good thing Phil came in when he did\u2014he noticed a tear slip from Dan&rsquo;s eye after being scolded at by his parents. Dan&rsquo;s parents had equally angry faces on.</p><p>His parents had never understood their lifestyle. They have chosen to believe that Dan faked it all to get attention, which is why it had taken him so long to open up to Phil about being a little in the first place.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Does everyone what some tea?</b></i>&rdquo; He asked, forcing a smile.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </b></i>Dan&rsquo;s mother said taking the cup, the angry expression never leaving her face.</p><p>They sat there quietly for a few minutes, sipping their tea as they watched Dan who had since crawled up into Phil&rsquo;s lap and was filling in the pictures in his coloring book. \u00a0</p><p>Dan pushed his books off to the side as he curled himself into Phil&rsquo;s side further. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Can I have some juice daddy?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked trying to whisper it in Phil&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>Phil was just about to answer when Dan&rsquo;s mother let out an angry huff.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daniel James Howell, you knock this shit off right now! Stop acting like a child! I want my Dan back!&rdquo;</b></i> by the time she was finished she was breathing heavily. Dan&rsquo;s father looked a bit shocked, as Phil guessed he hadn&rsquo;t expected his wife to have an outburst in front of Phil.</p><p>Phil curled his arm around a now sobbing Dan, furious. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk to him like that! He can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</i></b> Phil shouted angrily at Dan&rsquo;s mom.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me how I can and can&rsquo;t talk to my son! I have known him a lot longer than you have, and I can tell you right now he is faking this act!&rdquo;</i></b> she gestured towards Dan&rsquo;s shaking figure on the couch.</p><p>Phil quickly placed Dan on the couch and stood up.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to ask both of you to leave Dan doesn&rsquo;t need this kind of stress!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kicking us out?&rdquo; </i></b>Phil had no idea why she acted shocked by this.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yes, and if both of you don&rsquo;t leave right now I will call the police officer that is currently sitting outside watching this apartment come to escort you out!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Without another word she spun around and headed to the front door. Dan&rsquo;s father stood there looking more shocked than anything.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Steve, are you coming?&rdquo;</b></i> She yelled across the room.</p><p>Before he spun around he said to Phil <b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; </i></b>and briskly walked out the door, following his wife.</p><p>After Dan&rsquo;s parents stormed out it had taken Phil almost an hour to calm him down and even then, he hadn&rsquo;t really calmed him down, more Dan had exhausted himself and had passed out in Phil&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>Phil sat there for a few minutes, just letting Dan nap in his lap, but his legs were starting to cramp up. As gently as he could, he picked him up bridal style and carried him to their room. He made sure Dan was all tucked in before he made his way to the bathroom. He sighed. The last few weeks had been so stressful. He squeezed his fists together and winced as his injured hand shot pain up his arm. He decided he should probably clean his injury, and maybe he could get a quick nap in as well.</p><p>He unwrapped the gauze, hissing in pain once the last of it came off.</p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t gotten any better over the last two days. There was a bright red ring around the wound and there was pus coming from the stitches themselves. He dabbed the area around the wound with disinfectant and black spots danced in front of his vision from the pain. He cleaned the area as best as he could before he wrapped it back up again. Normally something like this would concern Phil, but he was too tired and exhausted to even worry about it. He stumbled his way back to their bedroom before he collapsed into the bed. Dan stirred, but didn&rsquo;t wake up, instead just snuggling into Phil&rsquo;s chest. It didn&rsquo;t take Phil long to fall into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Phil was awoken by the sound of Dan playing quietly in the bed next to him. The first thing he noticed was his head was pounding, and his hand felt like it was on fire. He groaned and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Morning, daddy,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan said smiling at him.</p><p>Phil forced a smile onto his face.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Morning, baby.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He felt like complete and utter shit, but he knew Dan needed to be taken care of. He groggily pulled himself out of bed and he checked Dan&rsquo;s diaper, mentally cursing himself for not checking before he laid Dan down yesterday. Luckily, Dan hadn&rsquo;t wet himself in the night. Phil spent the rest of the morning getting Dan breakfast and ready for his next therapy appointment. He had been hesitant to leave the apartment\u2014even for therapy\u2014but the officer stationed outside their apartment assured him that they would be following close behind and neither of them where in any danger.</p><p>So, reluctantly that afternoon, Phil and Dan made their way out to Dan&rsquo;s therapist. It went just about the same as last time, the only difference was Phil ended up nodding off in the waiting room as he still didn&rsquo;t feel very good. He was startled awake when Dan pulled on his arm.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You all done, baby?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yes! and look what I got!&rdquo;</i></b> He said showing Phil a teddy bear.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh, how nice. Where did you get that?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;The nice lady gave him to me. She said that he didn&rsquo;t have a home and I said he could come home and live with us.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil cooed and patted his head. They set up Dan&rsquo;s next appointment with Phil promising to bring in some of Dan&rsquo;s drawings with him next time. Since he had been feeling so poor this morning, he had forgotten to grab the couple he had picked out to bring.</p><p>Dan chatted mindlessly away about something, and if you had asked Phil about what Dan has said, he would not be able to tell you. He added the appropriate <i><b>&ldquo;mmm&rdquo;</b></i> and <i><b>&ldquo;is that so?&rdquo;</b></i> whenever was needed, but in all honesty, he just wanted to crawl back into bed and pass out. His head was pounding worse than ever and the pain in his hand had shot all the way up his arm to his elbow. Phil knew he should probably get it checked out, but at this point, he had no energy and he couldn&rsquo;t even imagine dragging Dan back out today. \u00a0</p><p>He pulled his key out of the apartment to unlock the door when he noticed that the door was already unlocked. He was sure he locked before they left earlier\u2014he had been making sure to double check ever since they had started receiving threats. But he figured he was so out of it this morning he probably forgot to lock it. Still not wanting to take the chance he called down to the current officer outside and asked if he would come up and check out the apartment.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, it looks all good, Phil, no one&rsquo;s in here.&rdquo;</i></b> The officer said taking one last look around the lounge.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Thank you for coming up to check.&rdquo;</i></b> He forced a smile, hoping the officer wouldn&rsquo;t want to exchange pleasantries. \u00a0</p><p>Luckily for him, the officer seemed to want to get out of the apartment as much as Phil wanted him to leave. \u00a0</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Not at all. If you need help or have any more questions I will be right outside.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil thanked the officer and asked him to lock the door on his way out. \u00a0</p><p>He was so tempted to just fall asleep on the sofa in the lounge, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t do that as Dan had just asked him for some juice.</p><p>Stumbling his way to the kitchen, he got Dan&rsquo;s favorite sippy cup out of the dishwasher, nearly crying when he hit his hand on the door to the dishwasher. He closed his eyes and pushed the pain away.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Danny, what kind of juice do you want?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil waited for an answer but he didn&rsquo;t get one. Figuring Dan had fallen asleep, he turned around to go check on him, but he didn&rsquo;t make it very far before a pain blossomed across his skull and everything went black.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>When he came to, the first thing he noticed was the pain in his head, the second thing he noticed was his hands were tied behind his back. His eyes shot open. He was in their bedroom. It was dark, but he could still make out Dan&rsquo;s brown eyes staring at him a few feet away.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Dan, are you ok?&rdquo;</i></b> Phil attempted to loosen the rope wrapped around his hands. Dan didn&rsquo;t answer\u2014he just whined in response to his question. He was in the process of trying to slide his way over to Dan when the door opened. Since it was dark, at first all he could see was a figure and some light spilling in behind them. The figure shut the door and turned on the light. Stood in front of him was the officer that had checked their apartment earlier.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thank god it&rsquo;s you. Come untie me.&rdquo;</b></i> Phil sighed in relief. But instead of making his way over to help him out, a sinister smile grew on his face.</p><p>Chuckling, he said, &ldquo;I sure had all of you fooled didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he asked looking more than pleased with himself. \u00a0</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s brows knitted in confusion.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What are you on about? Come over here and untie me.&rdquo; </i></b>He once again motioned his head behind him towards the ropes that had him bound.</p><p>The man took a few steps further into the room, and Phil&rsquo;s head started to scream danger!</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to do this, but you leaving the apartment unlocked was truly a godsend.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>&quot;I don&rsquo;t know, sir, I checked the apartment, but someone must have still been hiding inside.&rdquo;</i></b> He attempted a sweet and innocent voice, making Phil cringe.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll work on that later. Right now, I want to have some fun.&rdquo;</i></b> He grinned.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, Phil saw Dan. His eyes were wide with fear\u2014he looked absolutely terrified.</p><p>The man made his way over to Dan and Phil&rsquo;s heart raced. \u00a0</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Keep your hands off him!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil screamed. <b><i>&ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; \u00a0</i></b></p><p>The man simply chuckled, completely ignoring Phil and marching over to Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDid you miss me, princess?\u201d</b></i> he asked sickeningly. Dan violently shook his head, pushing himself more into the corner as if it could swallow him whole.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAww, don\u2019t be like that. We had lots of fun, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cShut up now or I swear to god!\u201d</b></i> Phil shouted, anger, but also terror, running through him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Or what? You\u2019ll never get out of here, at least not alive. And who would they believe? A baby and his pathetic daddy, or a police officer who\u2019s been serving for eight years?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The man finished their conversation by turning back to Dan and tilting his head up. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cShame you got away, princess. This isn\u2019t going to be much fun for you anymore,\u201d</i></b> he snickered, unbuckling his belt.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy, help me!\u201d</b></i> Dan cried, eyes wide as he stared at his daddy, expecting him to come save him.</p><p>\u201cAww, there-there, Daddy can\u2019t help you now.\u201d</p><p>Phil watched on with fear, anger and every other negative emotion boiling in his veins. Not only had the second guy got away free the first time, but Phil had let him stay outside their house for days on end. He\u2019d let him within a meter of Dan without questioning anything. This was all his fault. If only he\u2019d just held on a little longer or brought Dan to the bathroom with him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou got yourself a good one, Phil,\u201d</i></b> the man groaned, thrusting his hips in and out of Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cStop, please, he\u2019s little, do you know what this will do to him?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I care? Besides, the little princess puts up way less of a fight. He\u2019s a lot easier, just gotta tell him he\u2019s a good boy and he follows your every word.\u201d </i></b>he laughed, moaning as he came in Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cGo to sleep, princess. You\u2019ll need it for tomorrow.\u201d</i></b> The man buckled his pants, walking over to Phil.<b><i> \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get to have some fun tomorrow too. But you\u2019ll get a different kind of fun. So long,\u201d</i></b> he said, the last two words cheery as if they were old friends.</p><p>Phil listened as the man locked the door and shuffled along the floor on his knees towards Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cLove? Are you okay?\u201d </b></i>he asked carefully, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan cried, putting his head against Phil\u2019s chest. Phil desperately wanted to wrap his arms around his baby, but the ties around his wrists made that an impossible task.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Why did you not protect me?</i></b>\u201d he sobbed. \u201c<b><i>You said you would look after me but sir is back and I\u2019m so scared daddy. I\u2019m so scared of him.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil comforted him the best he could with just his words. Their captor returned for a minute, shoving two plates of food in front of them and forcing Dan\u2019s face into one with the bottom of his shoe.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEnjoy,</i></b>\u201d he said, walking back out of the room. Phil strained his ears as Dan tried to clean his face. He could make out the words \u201csafe\u201d and \u201clookout.\u201d It sounded like he was still in contacts with the police. The same police who believed they were safe at home far away from Dan\u2019s (and now Phil\u2019s) captor.</p>",

And since then, they had been receiving multiple letters a day. Even with the police watching the apartment, this maniac was still able to slip multiple letters a day, plus pictures of Phil leaving the police station the other day under their door.<br></p><p>The police couldn\u2019t answer how the letters were still getting to them, but they assured Phil that they were perfectly safe as long as they stayed in their apartment. Phil had scoffed when Luke had told him this. At this point, he had lost all his faith in the police. If they couldn\u2019t even keep a proper watch on their front door, how in the world were they supposed to be trusted to keep them safe? \u00a0</p><p>When Phil had informed them that Dan\u2019s family was coming to visit, they weren\u2019t too happy. Truth be told Phil, wasn\u2019t very happy about it either. They had all but invited themselves even after Phil tried telling them that Dan was just settling back at home and trying to recover. He didn\u2019t mention the letters to them either, so as far as they were concerned, the danger was over.</p><p>Dan\u2019s family even had to go through a whole search before they had been permitted to come up to their apartment. \u00a0</p><p>Dan currently sat in the middle of the living room in his Winnie the Pooh onesie, playing with his toys. Phil was trying to balance several teacups in his uninjured hand and carry them to the living room. Cursing himself he realized he had forgotten the sugar. He hauled the tray back into the kitchen to grab it. Just before he re-entered the living room, he heard hushed voices.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDaniel, this is ridiculous!. Stop acting like a child.\u201d</i></b> Phil heard Dan\u2019s mother hiss at him.</p><p>Phil stopped in the doorway to listen.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </b></i>a very confused Dan questioned in his little voice. \u00a0</p><p>His father angrily whispered, <b><i>\u201cI understand you went through a traumatic ordeal, but why do you have to act like this ?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Not letting this go any further, Phil quickly entered the living room and set the tray down on the coffee table. It\u2019s a good thing Phil came in when he did\u2014he noticed a tear slip from Dan\u2019s eye after being scolded at by his parents. Dan\u2019s parents had equally angry faces on.</p><p>His parents had never understood their lifestyle. They have chosen to believe that Dan faked it all to get attention, which is why it had taken him so long to open up to Phil about being a little in the first place.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDoes everyone what some tea?</b></i>\u201d He asked, forcing a smile.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThank you.\u201d </b></i>Dan\u2019s mother said taking the cup, the angry expression never leaving her face.</p><p>They sat there quietly for a few minutes, sipping their tea as they watched Dan who had since crawled up into Phil\u2019s lap and was filling in the pictures in his coloring book. \u00a0</p><p>Dan pushed his books off to the side as he curled himself into Phil\u2019s side further. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cCan I have some juice daddy?\u201d</i></b> He asked trying to whisper it in Phil\u2019s ear.</p><p>Phil was just about to answer when Dan\u2019s mother let out an angry huff.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaniel James Howell, you knock this shit off right now! Stop acting like a child! I want my Dan back!\u201d</b></i> by the time she was finished she was breathing heavily. Dan\u2019s father looked a bit shocked, as Phil guessed he hadn\u2019t expected his wife to have an outburst in front of Phil.</p><p>Phil curled his arm around a now sobbing Dan, furious. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to him like that! He can\u2019t help it!\u201d</i></b> Phil shouted angrily at Dan\u2019s mom.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me how I can and can\u2019t talk to my son! I have known him a lot longer than you have, and I can tell you right now he is faking this act!\u201d</i></b> she gestured towards Dan\u2019s shaking figure on the couch.</p><p>Phil quickly placed Dan on the couch and stood up.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask both of you to leave Dan doesn\u2019t need this kind of stress!\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou\u2019re kicking us out?\u201d </i></b>Phil had no idea why she acted shocked by this.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYes, and if both of you don\u2019t leave right now I will call the police officer that is currently sitting outside watching this apartment come to escort you out!\u201d</i></b></p><p>Without another word she spun around and headed to the front door. Dan\u2019s father stood there looking more shocked than anything.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSteve, are you coming?\u201d</b></i> She yelled across the room.</p><p>Before he spun around he said to Phil <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d </i></b>and briskly walked out the door, following his wife.</p><p>After Dan\u2019s parents stormed out it had taken Phil almost an hour to calm him down and even then, he hadn\u2019t really calmed him down, more Dan had exhausted himself and had passed out in Phil\u2019s lap.</p><p>Phil sat there for a few minutes, just letting Dan nap in his lap, but his legs were starting to cramp up. As gently as he could, he picked him up bridal style and carried him to their room. He made sure Dan was all tucked in before he made his way to the bathroom. He sighed. The last few weeks had been so stressful. He squeezed his fists together and winced as his injured hand shot pain up his arm. He decided he should probably clean his injury, and maybe he could get a quick nap in as well.</p><p>He unwrapped the gauze, hissing in pain once the last of it came off.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t gotten any better over the last two days. There was a bright red ring around the wound and there was pus coming from the stitches themselves. He dabbed the area around the wound with disinfectant and black spots danced in front of his vision from the pain. He cleaned the area as best as he could before he wrapped it back up again. Normally something like this would concern Phil, but he was too tired and exhausted to even worry about it. He stumbled his way back to their bedroom before he collapsed into the bed. Dan stirred, but didn\u2019t wake up, instead just snuggling into Phil\u2019s chest. It didn\u2019t take Phil long to fall into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Phil was awoken by the sound of Dan playing quietly in the bed next to him. The first thing he noticed was his head was pounding, and his hand felt like it was on fire. He groaned and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Morning, daddy,\u201d </b></i>Dan said smiling at him.</p><p>Phil forced a smile onto his face.</p><p><i><b>\u201cMorning, baby.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He felt like complete and utter shit, but he knew Dan needed to be taken care of. He groggily pulled himself out of bed and he checked Dan\u2019s diaper, mentally cursing himself for not checking before he laid Dan down yesterday. Luckily, Dan hadn\u2019t wet himself in the night. Phil spent the rest of the morning getting Dan breakfast and ready for his next therapy appointment. He had been hesitant to leave the apartment\u2014even for therapy\u2014but the officer stationed outside their apartment assured him that they would be following close behind and neither of them where in any danger.</p><p>So, reluctantly that afternoon, Phil and Dan made their way out to Dan\u2019s therapist. It went just about the same as last time, the only difference was Phil ended up nodding off in the waiting room as he still didn\u2019t feel very good. He was startled awake when Dan pulled on his arm.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou all done, baby?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cYes! and look what I got!\u201d</i></b> He said showing Phil a teddy bear.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh, how nice. Where did you get that?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cThe nice lady gave him to me. She said that he didn\u2019t have a home and I said he could come home and live with us.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil cooed and patted his head. They set up Dan\u2019s next appointment with Phil promising to bring in some of Dan\u2019s drawings with him next time. Since he had been feeling so poor this morning, he had forgotten to grab the couple he had picked out to bring.</p><p>Dan chatted mindlessly away about something, and if you had asked Phil about what Dan has said, he would not be able to tell you. He added the appropriate <i><b>\u201cmmm\u201d</b></i> and <i><b>\u201cis that so?\u201d</b></i> whenever was needed, but in all honesty, he just wanted to crawl back into bed and pass out. His head was pounding worse than ever and the pain in his hand had shot all the way up his arm to his elbow. Phil knew he should probably get it checked out, but at this point, he had no energy and he couldn\u2019t even imagine dragging Dan back out today. \u00a0</p><p>He pulled his key out of the apartment to unlock the door when he noticed that the door was already unlocked.

This isn\u2019t going to be much fun for you anymore,\u201d</i></b> he snickered, unbuckling his belt.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy, help me!\u201d</b></i> Dan cried, eyes wide as he stared at his daddy, expecting him to come save him.</p><p>\u201cAww, there-there, Daddy can\u2019t help you now.\u201d</p><p>Phil watched on with fear, anger and every other negative emotion boiling in his veins. Not only had the second guy got away free the first time, but Phil had let him stay outside their house for days on end. He\u2019d let him within a meter of Dan without questioning anything. This was all his fault. If only he\u2019d just held on a little longer or brought Dan to the bathroom with him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou got yourself a good one, Phil,\u201d</i></b> the man groaned, thrusting his hips in and out of Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cStop, please, he\u2019s little, do you know what this will do to him?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I care? Besides, the little princess puts up way less of a fight. He\u2019s a lot easier, just gotta tell him he\u2019s a good boy and he follows your every word.\u201d </i></b>he laughed, moaning as he came in Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cGo to sleep, princess. You\u2019ll need it for tomorrow.\u201d</i></b> The man buckled his pants, walking over to Phil.<b><i> \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get to have some fun tomorrow too. But you\u2019ll get a different kind of fun. So long,\u201d</i></b> he said, the last two words cheery as if they were old friends.</p><p>Phil listened as the man locked the door and shuffled along the floor on his knees towards Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cLove? Are you okay?\u201d </b></i>he asked carefully, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan cried, putting his head against Phil\u2019s chest. Phil desperately wanted to wrap his arms around his baby, but the ties around his wrists made that an impossible task.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Why did you not protect me?</i></b>\u201d he sobbed. \u201c<b><i>You said you would look after me but sir is back and I\u2019m so scared daddy. I\u2019m so scared of him.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil comforted him the best he could with just his words. Their captor returned for a minute, shoving two plates of food in front of them and forcing Dan\u2019s face into one with the bottom of his shoe.</p><p><b><i>\u201cEnjoy,</i></b>\u201d he said, walking back out of the room. Phil strained his ears as Dan tried to clean his face. He could make out the words \u201csafe\u201d and \u201clookout.\u201d It sounded like he was still in contacts with the police. The same police who believed they were safe at home far away from Dan\u2019s (and now Phil\u2019s) captor.</p>",

And since then, they had been receiving multiple letters a day. Even with the police watching the apartment, this maniac was still able to slip multiple letters a day, plus pictures of Phil leaving the police station the other day under their door.<br></p><p>The police couldn\u2019t answer how the letters were still getting to them, but they assured Phil that they were perfectly safe as long as they stayed in their apartment. Phil had scoffed when Luke had told him this. At this point, he had lost all his faith in the police. If they couldn\u2019t even keep a proper watch on their front door, how in the world were they supposed to be trusted to keep them safe? \u00a0</p><p>When Phil had informed them that Dan\u2019s family was coming to visit, they weren\u2019t too happy. Truth be told Phil, wasn\u2019t very happy about it either. They had all but invited themselves even after Phil tried telling them that Dan was just settling back at home and trying to recover. He didn\u2019t mention the letters to them either, so as far as they were concerned, the danger was over.</p><p>Dan\u2019s family even had to go through a whole search before they had been permitted to come up to their apartment. \u00a0</p><p>Dan currently sat in the middle of the living room in his Winnie the Pooh onesie, playing with his toys. Phil was trying to balance several teacups in his uninjured hand and carry them to the living room. Cursing himself he realized he had forgotten the sugar. He hauled the tray back into the kitchen to grab it. Just before he re-entered the living room, he heard hushed voices.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDaniel, this is ridiculous!. Stop acting like a child.\u201d</i></b> Phil heard Dan\u2019s mother hiss at him.</p><p>Phil stopped in the doorway to listen.</p><p><i><b>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </b></i>a very confused Dan questioned in his little voice. \u00a0</p><p>His father angrily whispered, <b><i>\u201cI understand you went through a traumatic ordeal, but why do you have to act like this ?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Not letting this go any further, Phil quickly entered the living room and set the tray down on the coffee table. It\u2019s a good thing Phil came in when he did\u2014he noticed a tear slip from Dan\u2019s eye after being scolded at by his parents. Dan\u2019s parents had equally angry faces on.</p><p>His parents had never understood their lifestyle. They have chosen to believe that Dan faked it all to get attention, which is why it had taken him so long to open up to Phil about being a little in the first place.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDoes everyone what some tea?</b></i>\u201d He asked, forcing a smile.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThank you.\u201d </b></i>Dan\u2019s mother said taking the cup, the angry expression never leaving her face.</p><p>They sat there quietly for a few minutes, sipping their tea as they watched Dan who had since crawled up into Phil\u2019s lap and was filling in the pictures in his coloring book. \u00a0</p><p>Dan pushed his books off to the side as he curled himself into Phil\u2019s side further. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cCan I have some juice daddy?\u201d</i></b> He asked trying to whisper it in Phil\u2019s ear.</p><p>Phil was just about to answer when Dan\u2019s mother let out an angry huff.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaniel James Howell, you knock this shit off right now! Stop acting like a child! I want my Dan back!\u201d</b></i> by the time she was finished she was breathing heavily. Dan\u2019s father looked a bit shocked, as Phil guessed he hadn\u2019t expected his wife to have an outburst in front of Phil.</p><p>Phil curled his arm around a now sobbing Dan, furious. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to him like that! He can\u2019t help it!\u201d</i></b> Phil shouted angrily at Dan\u2019s mom.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me how I can and can\u2019t talk to my son! I have known him a lot longer than you have, and I can tell you right now he is faking this act!\u201d</i></b> she gestured towards Dan\u2019s shaking figure on the couch.</p><p>Phil quickly placed Dan on the couch and stood up.</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask both of you to leave Dan doesn\u2019t need this kind of stress!\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cYou\u2019re kicking us out?\u201d </i></b>Phil had no idea why she acted shocked by this.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYes, and if both of you don\u2019t leave right now I will call the police officer that is currently sitting outside watching this apartment come to escort you out!\u201d</i></b></p><p>Without another word she spun around and headed to the front door. Dan\u2019s father stood there looking more shocked than anything.</p><p><i><b>\u201cSteve, are you coming?\u201d</b></i> She yelled across the room.</p><p>Before he spun around he said to Phil <b><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d </i></b>and briskly walked out the door, following his wife.</p><p>After Dan\u2019s parents stormed out it had taken Phil almost an hour to calm him down and even then, he hadn\u2019t really calmed him down, more Dan had exhausted himself and had passed out in Phil\u2019s lap.</p><p>Phil sat there for a few minutes, just letting Dan nap in his lap, but his legs were starting to cramp up. As gently as he could, he picked him up bridal style and carried him to their room. He made sure Dan was all tucked in before he made his way to the bathroom. He sighed. The last few weeks had been so stressful. He squeezed his fists together and winced as his injured hand shot pain up his arm. He decided he should probably clean his injury, and maybe he could get a quick nap in as well.</p><p>He unwrapped the gauze, hissing in pain once the last of it came off.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t gotten any better over the last two days. There was a bright red ring around the wound and there was pus coming from the stitches themselves. He dabbed the area around the wound with disinfectant and black spots danced in front of his vision from the pain. He cleaned the area as best as he could before he wrapped it back up again. Normally something like this would concern Phil, but he was too tired and exhausted to even worry about it. He stumbled his way back to their bedroom before he collapsed into the bed. Dan stirred, but didn\u2019t wake up, instead just snuggling into Phil\u2019s chest. It didn\u2019t take Phil long to fall into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Phil was awoken by the sound of Dan playing quietly in the bed next to him. The first thing he noticed was his head was pounding, and his hand felt like it was on fire. He groaned and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>\u201c<i><b>Morning, daddy,\u201d </b></i>Dan said smiling at him.</p><p>Phil forced a smile onto his face.</p><p><i><b>\u201cMorning, baby.\u201d</b></i></p><p>He felt like complete and utter shit, but he knew Dan needed to be taken care of. He groggily pulled himself out of bed and he checked Dan\u2019s diaper, mentally cursing himself for not checking before he laid Dan down yesterday. Luckily, Dan hadn\u2019t wet himself in the night. Phil spent the rest of the morning getting Dan breakfast and ready for his next therapy appointment. He had been hesitant to leave the apartment\u2014even for therapy\u2014but the officer stationed outside their apartment assured him that they would be following close behind and neither of them where in any danger.</p><p>So, reluctantly that afternoon, Phil and Dan made their way out to Dan\u2019s therapist. It went just about the same as last time, the only difference was Phil ended up nodding off in the waiting room as he still didn\u2019t feel very good. He was startled awake when Dan pulled on his arm.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou all done, baby?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cYes! and look what I got!\u201d</i></b> He said showing Phil a teddy bear.</p><p><i><b>\u201cOh, how nice. Where did you get that?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cThe nice lady gave him to me. She said that he didn\u2019t have a home and I said he could come home and live with us.\u201d</b></i></p><p>Phil cooed and patted his head. They set up Dan\u2019s next appointment with Phil promising to bring in some of Dan\u2019s drawings with him next time. Since he had been feeling so poor this morning, he had forgotten to grab the couple he had picked out to bring.</p><p>Dan chatted mindlessly away about something, and if you had asked Phil about what Dan has said, he would not be able to tell you. He added the appropriate <i><b>\u201cmmm\u201d</b></i> and <i><b>\u201cis that so?\u201d</b></i> whenever was needed, but in all honesty, he just wanted to crawl back into bed and pass out. His head was pounding worse than ever and the pain in his hand had shot all the way up his arm to his elbow. Phil knew he should probably get it checked out, but at this point, he had no energy and he couldn\u2019t even imagine dragging Dan back out today. \u00a0</p><p>He pulled his key out of the apartment to unlock the door when he noticed that the door was already unlocked. He was sure he locked before they left earlier\u2014he had been making sure to double check ever since they had started receiving threats. But he figured he was so out of it this morning he probably forgot to lock it. Still not wanting to take the chance he called down to the current officer outside and asked if he would come up and check out the apartment.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, it looks all good, Phil, no one\u2019s in here.\u201d</i></b> The officer said taking one last look around the lounge.</p><p><b><i>\u201cThank you for coming up to check.\u201d</i></b> He forced a smile, hoping the officer wouldn\u2019t want to exchange pleasantries. \u00a0</p><p>Luckily for him, the officer seemed to want to get out of the apartment as much as Phil wanted him to leave. \u00a0</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Not at all. If you need help or have any more questions I will be right outside.\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil thanked the officer and asked him to lock the door on his way out. \u00a0</p><p>He was so tempted to just fall asleep on the sofa in the lounge, but he knew he couldn\u2019t do that as Dan had just asked him for some juice.</p><p>Stumbling his way to the kitchen, he got Dan\u2019s favorite sippy cup out of the dishwasher, nearly crying when he hit his hand on the door to the dishwasher. He closed his eyes and pushed the pain away.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Danny, what kind of juice do you want?\u201d</i></b></p><p>Phil waited for an answer but he didn\u2019t get one. Figuring Dan had fallen asleep, he turned around to go check on him, but he didn\u2019t make it very far before a pain blossomed across his skull and everything went black.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>When he came to, the first thing he noticed was the pain in his head, the second thing he noticed was his hands were tied behind his back. His eyes shot open. He was in their bedroom. It was dark, but he could still make out Dan\u2019s brown eyes staring at him a few feet away.</p><p><b><i>\u201cDan, are you ok?\u201d</i></b> Phil attempted to loosen the rope wrapped around his hands. Dan didn\u2019t answer\u2014he just whined in response to his question. He was in the process of trying to slide his way over to Dan when the door opened. Since it was dark, at first all he could see was a figure and some light spilling in behind them. The figure shut the door and turned on the light. Stood in front of him was the officer that had checked their apartment earlier.</p><p><i><b>\u201cThank god it\u2019s you. Come untie me.\u201d</b></i> Phil sighed in relief. But instead of making his way over to help him out, a sinister smile grew on his face.</p><p>Chuckling, he said, \u201cI sure had all of you fooled didn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked looking more than pleased with himself. \u00a0</p><p>Phil\u2019s brows knitted in confusion.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWhat are you on about? Come over here and untie me.\u201d </i></b>He once again motioned his head behind him towards the ropes that had him bound.</p><p>The man took a few steps further into the room, and Phil\u2019s head started to scream danger!</p><p><b><i>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for the right time to do this, but you leaving the apartment unlocked was truly a godsend.\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\"I don\u2019t know, sir, I checked the apartment, but someone must have still been hiding inside.\u201d</i></b> He attempted a sweet and innocent voice, making Phil cringe.</p><p><b><i>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll work on that later. Right now, I want to have some fun.\u201d</i></b> He grinned.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, Phil saw Dan. His eyes were wide with fear\u2014he looked absolutely terrified.</p><p>The man made his way over to Dan and Phil\u2019s heart raced. \u00a0</p><p><i><b>\u201cKeep your hands off him!\u201d </b></i>Phil screamed. <b><i>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d \u00a0</i></b></p><p>The man simply chuckled, completely ignoring Phil and marching over to Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDid you miss me, princess?\u201d</b></i> he asked sickeningly. Dan violently shook his head, pushing himself more into the corner as if it could swallow him whole.</p><p><i><b>\u201cAww, don\u2019t be like that. We had lots of fun, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</b></i></p><p><i><b>\u201cShut up now or I swear to god!\u201d</b></i> Phil shouted, anger, but also terror, running through him.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Or what? You\u2019ll never get out of here, at least not alive. And who would they believe? A baby and his pathetic daddy, or a police officer who\u2019s been serving for eight years?\u201d</i></b></p><p>The man finished their conversation by turning back to Dan and tilting his head up. \u00a0</p><p><b><i>\u201cShame you got away, princess. This isn\u2019t going to be much fun for you anymore,\u201d</i></b> he snickered, unbuckling his belt.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy, help me!\u201d</b></i> Dan cried, eyes wide as he stared at his daddy, expecting him to come save him.</p><p>\u201cAww, there-there, Daddy can\u2019t help you now.\u201d</p><p>Phil watched on with fear, anger and every other negative emotion boiling in his veins. Not only had the second guy got away free the first time, but Phil had let him stay outside their house for days on end. He\u2019d let him within a meter of Dan without questioning anything. This was all his fault. If only he\u2019d just held on a little longer or brought Dan to the bathroom with him.</p><p><b><i>\u201cYou got yourself a good one, Phil,\u201d</i></b> the man groaned, thrusting his hips in and out of Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cStop, please, he\u2019s little, do you know what this will do to him?\u201d</i></b></p><p><b><i>\u201cDo you think I care? Besides, the little princess puts up way less of a fight. He\u2019s a lot easier, just gotta tell him he\u2019s a good boy and he follows your every word.\u201d </i></b>he laughed, moaning as he came in Dan\u2019s mouth.</p><p><b><i>\u201cGo to sleep, princess. You\u2019ll need it for tomorrow.\u201d</i></b> The man buckled his pants, walking over to Phil.<b><i> \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get to have some fun tomorrow too. But you\u2019ll get a different kind of fun. So long,\u201d</i></b> he said, the last two words cheery as if they were old friends.</p><p>Phil listened as the man locked the door and shuffled along the floor on his knees towards Dan.</p><p><i><b>\u201cLove? Are you okay?\u201d </b></i>he asked carefully, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>\u201cDaddy!\u201d </b></i>Dan cried, putting his head against Phil\u2019s chest. Phil desperately wanted to wrap his arms around his baby, but the ties around his wrists made that an impossible task.</p><p>\u201c<b><i>Why did you not protect me?</i></b>\u201d he sobbed. \u201c<b><i>You said you would look after me but sir is back and I\u2019m so scared daddy.

Heavy trigger warning</p><p>Read on&nbsp;<i><b><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/14863604/chapters/36497133\">Ao3</a></b></i></p><p>Read on&nbsp;<b><i><a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/619188603-seized-chapter-12\">Wattpad</a></i></b></p><p><b><a href=\"https://glitterrhowell.tumblr.com/post/176897136611/chapter-11\">Previous Chapter&nbsp;</a>/ <a href=\"https://glitterrhowell.tumblr.com/post/177169981511/chapter-13\">Next Chapter</a></b></p><p>When Phil had left the police station two days ago with the first letter, he had been looking over his shoulder the whole way home. And since then, they had been receiving multiple letters a day. Even with the police watching the apartment, this maniac was still able to slip multiple letters a day, plus pictures of Phil leaving the police station the other day under their door.<br /></p><p>The police couldn&rsquo;t answer how the letters were still getting to them, but they assured Phil that they were perfectly safe as long as they stayed in their apartment. Phil had scoffed when Luke had told him this. At this point, he had lost all his faith in the police. If they couldn&rsquo;t even keep a proper watch on their front door, how in the world were they supposed to be trusted to keep them safe? &nbsp;</p><p>When Phil had informed them that Dan&rsquo;s family was coming to visit, they weren&rsquo;t too happy. Truth be told Phil, wasn&rsquo;t very happy about it either. They had all but invited themselves even after Phil tried telling them that Dan was just settling back at home and trying to recover. He didn&rsquo;t mention the letters to them either, so as far as they were concerned, the danger was over.</p><p>Dan&rsquo;s family even had to go through a whole search before they had been permitted to come up to their apartment. &nbsp;</p><p>Dan currently sat in the middle of the living room in his Winnie the Pooh onesie, playing with his toys. Phil was trying to balance several teacups in his uninjured hand and carry them to the living room. Cursing himself he realized he had forgotten the sugar. He hauled the tray back into the kitchen to grab it. Just before he re-entered the living room, he heard hushed voices.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Daniel, this is ridiculous!. Stop acting like a child.&rdquo;</i></b> Phil heard Dan&rsquo;s mother hiss at him.</p><p>Phil stopped in the doorway to listen.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </b></i>a very confused Dan questioned in his little voice. &nbsp;</p><p>His father angrily whispered, <b><i>&ldquo;I understand you went through a traumatic ordeal, but why do you have to act like this ?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Not letting this go any further, Phil quickly entered the living room and set the tray down on the coffee table. It&rsquo;s a good thing Phil came in when he did&mdash;he noticed a tear slip from Dan&rsquo;s eye after being scolded at by his parents. Dan&rsquo;s parents had equally angry faces on.</p><p>His parents had never understood their lifestyle. They have chosen to believe that Dan faked it all to get attention, which is why it had taken him so long to open up to Phil about being a little in the first place.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Does everyone what some tea?</b></i>&rdquo; He asked, forcing a smile.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; </b></i>Dan&rsquo;s mother said taking the cup, the angry expression never leaving her face.</p><p>They sat there quietly for a few minutes, sipping their tea as they watched Dan who had since crawled up into Phil&rsquo;s lap and was filling in the pictures in his coloring book. &nbsp;</p><p>Dan pushed his books off to the side as he curled himself into Phil&rsquo;s side further. &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Can I have some juice daddy?&rdquo;</i></b> He asked trying to whisper it in Phil&rsquo;s ear.</p><p>Phil was just about to answer when Dan&rsquo;s mother let out an angry huff.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daniel James Howell, you knock this shit off right now! Stop acting like a child! I want my Dan back!&rdquo;</b></i> by the time she was finished she was breathing heavily. Dan&rsquo;s father looked a bit shocked, as Phil guessed he hadn&rsquo;t expected his wife to have an outburst in front of Phil.</p><p>Phil curled his arm around a now sobbing Dan, furious. &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk to him like that! He can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</i></b> Phil shouted angrily at Dan&rsquo;s mom.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell me how I can and can&rsquo;t talk to my son! I have known him a lot longer than you have, and I can tell you right now he is faking this act!&rdquo;</i></b> she gestured towards Dan&rsquo;s shaking figure on the couch.</p><p>Phil quickly placed Dan on the couch and stood up.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have to ask both of you to leave Dan doesn&rsquo;t need this kind of stress!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kicking us out?&rdquo; </i></b>Phil had no idea why she acted shocked by this.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yes, and if both of you don&rsquo;t leave right now I will call the police officer that is currently sitting outside watching this apartment come to escort you out!&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Without another word she spun around and headed to the front door. Dan&rsquo;s father stood there looking more shocked than anything.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Steve, are you coming?&rdquo;</b></i> She yelled across the room.</p><p>Before he spun around he said to Phil <b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; </i></b>and briskly walked out the door, following his wife.</p><p>After Dan&rsquo;s parents stormed out it had taken Phil almost an hour to calm him down and even then, he hadn&rsquo;t really calmed him down, more Dan had exhausted himself and had passed out in Phil&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>Phil sat there for a few minutes, just letting Dan nap in his lap, but his legs were starting to cramp up. As gently as he could, he picked him up bridal style and carried him to their room. He made sure Dan was all tucked in before he made his way to the bathroom. He sighed. The last few weeks had been so stressful. He squeezed his fists together and winced as his injured hand shot pain up his arm. He decided he should probably clean his injury, and maybe he could get a quick nap in as well.</p><p>He unwrapped the gauze, hissing in pain once the last of it came off.</p><p>It hadn&rsquo;t gotten any better over the last two days. There was a bright red ring around the wound and there was pus coming from the stitches themselves. He dabbed the area around the wound with disinfectant and black spots danced in front of his vision from the pain. He cleaned the area as best as he could before he wrapped it back up again. Normally something like this would concern Phil, but he was too tired and exhausted to even worry about it. He stumbled his way back to their bedroom before he collapsed into the bed. Dan stirred, but didn&rsquo;t wake up, instead just snuggling into Phil&rsquo;s chest. It didn&rsquo;t take Phil long to fall into a dreamless sleep.</p><p>The next morning, Phil was awoken by the sound of Dan playing quietly in the bed next to him. The first thing he noticed was his head was pounding, and his hand felt like it was on fire. He groaned and rubbed his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;<i><b>Morning, daddy,&rdquo; </b></i>Dan said smiling at him.</p><p>Phil forced a smile onto his face.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Morning, baby.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>He felt like complete and utter shit, but he knew Dan needed to be taken care of. He groggily pulled himself out of bed and he checked Dan&rsquo;s diaper, mentally cursing himself for not checking before he laid Dan down yesterday. Luckily, Dan hadn&rsquo;t wet himself in the night. Phil spent the rest of the morning getting Dan breakfast and ready for his next therapy appointment. He had been hesitant to leave the apartment&mdash;even for therapy&mdash;but the officer stationed outside their apartment assured him that they would be following close behind and neither of them where in any danger.</p><p>So, reluctantly that afternoon, Phil and Dan made their way out to Dan&rsquo;s therapist. It went just about the same as last time, the only difference was Phil ended up nodding off in the waiting room as he still didn&rsquo;t feel very good. He was startled awake when Dan pulled on his arm.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You all done, baby?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Yes! and look what I got!&rdquo;</i></b> He said showing Phil a teddy bear.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Oh, how nice. Where did you get that?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;The nice lady gave him to me. She said that he didn&rsquo;t have a home and I said he could come home and live with us.&rdquo;</b></i></p><p>Phil cooed and patted his head. They set up Dan&rsquo;s next appointment with Phil promising to bring in some of Dan&rsquo;s drawings with him next time. Since he had been feeling so poor this morning, he had forgotten to grab the couple he had picked out to bring.</p><p>Dan chatted mindlessly away about something, and if you had asked Phil about what Dan has said, he would not be able to tell you. He added the appropriate <i><b>&ldquo;mmm&rdquo;</b></i> and <i><b>&ldquo;is that so?&rdquo;</b></i> whenever was needed, but in all honesty, he just wanted to crawl back into bed and pass out. His head was pounding worse than ever and the pain in his hand had shot all the way up his arm to his elbow. Phil knew he should probably get it checked out, but at this point, he had no energy and he couldn&rsquo;t even imagine dragging Dan back out today. &nbsp;</p><p>He pulled his key out of the apartment to unlock the door when he noticed that the door was already unlocked. He was sure he locked before they left earlier&mdash;he had been making sure to double check ever since they had started receiving threats. But he figured he was so out of it this morning he probably forgot to lock it. Still not wanting to take the chance he called down to the current officer outside and asked if he would come up and check out the apartment.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, it looks all good, Phil, no one&rsquo;s in here.&rdquo;</i></b> The officer said taking one last look around the lounge.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Thank you for coming up to check.&rdquo;</i></b> He forced a smile, hoping the officer wouldn&rsquo;t want to exchange pleasantries. &nbsp;</p><p>Luckily for him, the officer seemed to want to get out of the apartment as much as Phil wanted him to leave. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Not at all. If you need help or have any more questions I will be right outside.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil thanked the officer and asked him to lock the door on his way out. &nbsp;</p><p>He was so tempted to just fall asleep on the sofa in the lounge, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t do that as Dan had just asked him for some juice.</p><p>Stumbling his way to the kitchen, he got Dan&rsquo;s favorite sippy cup out of the dishwasher, nearly crying when he hit his hand on the door to the dishwasher. He closed his eyes and pushed the pain away.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Danny, what kind of juice do you want?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil waited for an answer but he didn&rsquo;t get one. Figuring Dan had fallen asleep, he turned around to go check on him, but he didn&rsquo;t make it very far before a pain blossomed across his skull and everything went black.</p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><p>When he came to, the first thing he noticed was the pain in his head, the second thing he noticed was his hands were tied behind his back. His eyes shot open. He was in their bedroom. It was dark, but he could still make out Dan&rsquo;s brown eyes staring at him a few feet away.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Dan, are you ok?&rdquo;</i></b> Phil attempted to loosen the rope wrapped around his hands. Dan didn&rsquo;t answer&mdash;he just whined in response to his question. He was in the process of trying to slide his way over to Dan when the door opened. Since it was dark, at first all he could see was a figure and some light spilling in behind them. The figure shut the door and turned on the light. Stood in front of him was the officer that had checked their apartment earlier.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Thank god it&rsquo;s you. Come untie me.&rdquo;</b></i> Phil sighed in relief. But instead of making his way over to help him out, a sinister smile grew on his face.</p><p>Chuckling, he said, &ldquo;I sure had all of you fooled didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he asked looking more than pleased with himself. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil&rsquo;s brows knitted in confusion.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;What are you on about? Come over here and untie me.&rdquo; </i></b>He once again motioned his head behind him towards the ropes that had him bound.</p><p>The man took a few steps further into the room, and Phil&rsquo;s head started to scream danger!</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the right time to do this, but you leaving the apartment unlocked was truly a godsend.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>\"I don&rsquo;t know, sir, I checked the apartment, but someone must have still been hiding inside.&rdquo;</i></b> He attempted a sweet and innocent voice, making Phil cringe.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll work on that later. Right now, I want to have some fun.&rdquo;</i></b> He grinned.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, Phil saw Dan. His eyes were wide with fear&mdash;he looked absolutely terrified.</p><p>The man made his way over to Dan and Phil&rsquo;s heart raced. &nbsp;</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Keep your hands off him!&rdquo; </b></i>Phil screamed. <b><i>&ldquo;Leave him alone!&rdquo; &nbsp;</i></b></p><p>The man simply chuckled, completely ignoring Phil and marching over to Dan.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Did you miss me, princess?&rdquo;</b></i> he asked sickeningly. Dan violently shook his head, pushing himself more into the corner as if it could swallow him whole.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Aww, don&rsquo;t be like that. We had lots of fun, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</b></i></p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Shut up now or I swear to god!&rdquo;</b></i> Phil shouted, anger, but also terror, running through him.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Or what? You&rsquo;ll never get out of here, at least not alive. And who would they believe? A baby and his pathetic daddy, or a police officer who&rsquo;s been serving for eight years?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>The man finished their conversation by turning back to Dan and tilting his head up. &nbsp;</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Shame you got away, princess. This isn&rsquo;t going to be much fun for you anymore,&rdquo;</i></b> he snickered, unbuckling his belt.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daddy, help me!&rdquo;</b></i> Dan cried, eyes wide as he stared at his daddy, expecting him to come save him.</p><p>&ldquo;Aww, there-there, Daddy can&rsquo;t help you now.&rdquo;</p><p>Phil watched on with fear, anger and every other negative emotion boiling in his veins. Not only had the second guy got away free the first time, but Phil had let him stay outside their house for days on end. He&rsquo;d let him within a meter of Dan without questioning anything. This was all his fault. If only he&rsquo;d just held on a little longer or brought Dan to the bathroom with him.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;You got yourself a good one, Phil,&rdquo;</i></b> the man groaned, thrusting his hips in and out of Dan&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Stop, please, he&rsquo;s little, do you know what this will do to him?&rdquo;</i></b></p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Do you think I care? Besides, the little princess puts up way less of a fight. He&rsquo;s a lot easier, just gotta tell him he&rsquo;s a good boy and he follows your every word.&rdquo; </i></b>he laughed, moaning as he came in Dan&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Go to sleep, princess. You&rsquo;ll need it for tomorrow.&rdquo;</i></b> The man buckled his pants, walking over to Phil.<b><i> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get to have some fun tomorrow too. But you&rsquo;ll get a different kind of fun. So long,&rdquo;</i></b> he said, the last two words cheery as if they were old friends.</p><p>Phil listened as the man locked the door and shuffled along the floor on his knees towards Dan.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Love? Are you okay?&rdquo; </b></i>he asked carefully, tears welling in his eyes.</p><p><i><b>&ldquo;Daddy!&rdquo; </b></i>Dan cried, putting his head against Phil&rsquo;s chest. Phil desperately wanted to wrap his arms around his baby, but the ties around his wrists made that an impossible task.</p><p>&ldquo;<b><i>Why did you not protect me?</i></b>&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;<b><i>You said you would look after me but sir is back and I&rsquo;m so scared daddy. I&rsquo;m so scared of him.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p>Phil comforted him the best he could with just his words. Their captor returned for a minute, shoving two plates of food in front of them and forcing Dan&rsquo;s face into one with the bottom of his shoe.</p><p><b><i>&ldquo;Enjoy,</i></b>&rdquo; he said, walking back out of the room. Phil strained his ears as Dan tried to clean his face. He could make out the words &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;lookout.&rdquo; It sounded like he was still in contacts with the police. The same police who believed they were safe at home far away from Dan&rsquo;s (and now Phil&rsquo;s) captor.</p>",
