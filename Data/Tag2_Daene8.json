        "answer": "<p>I disagree that he\u2019s the sort of person to do that. While his handling of mothers in ASOIAF is questionable, he\u2019s not overtly sexist. Is he problematic at times? Yes. However, if you compare his female characters to what we get in the show, there is a huge difference, particularly in Daenerys.</p><p>He\u2019s also not a nihilist. There are more near death experiences and fake outs in his books than in the show. He doesn\u2019t kill someone for shock value. You builds a journey to a specific point. You can look back at Ned\u2019s death and the Red Wedding to see the decisions that lead to those moments. Meanwhile D&amp;D are killing Missandei, Rhaegal, Ser Barristan and others because they want to isolate Daenerys.</p><p>I\u2019m also going to link you to a few different posts from people who have gone into far more detail than me to why the books will be different from the show</p><p>(<a href=\"https://tomakeitbeautifultolive.tumblr.com/post/185031681513/well-a-new-interview-confirmed-that-dd-talked\">1</a>) (<a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/185113702903/so-pretty-much-the-entire-story-about-danys\">2</a>) (<a href=\"https://moonlitgleek.tumblr.com/post/184857592420/but-george-said-the-main-characters-ending-will\">3</a>) (<a href=\"https://my-arya-underfoot.tumblr.com/post/184732873395/how-the-latest-got-plot-lines-up-with-the-books\">4</a>) (<a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/184947355163/this-is-the-same-ending-for-dany-in-the-books-so\">5</a>) (<a href=\"https://instantbouquetface-me.tumblr.com/post/185016015988/thoughts-on-game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-6\">6</a>)</p><p>Furthermore, so many things have been changed by the show. Characters that will have significance and importance were left out or given to someone else. Prophecies that will play a part in the ending have been ignored. If Dany dies, it would be in the War for the Dawn, which GRRM has stated is the most important aspect of the series. The throne is petty and small and we\u2019re meant to see that when the Others start coming more into focus. All you need to show the differences in interpretation is the names of the series. For GRRM\u00a0\u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d is more important, all the different ways this could be interpreted, but most strongly is the fight against the Others and Dany\u2019s role in that. For D&amp;D, it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. It\u2019s the political struggle. The fantasy was always secondary to them.</p><p>What stands out to me as being a glaring sign that the books will be different is the manner of Cersei\u2019s death. Her entire arc is working towards this self fulfilling prophecy, that she\u2019ll be cast down, lose everything she loves and killed by the \u201c<i>Valonqar</i>  \u201c but that is left out in the show. Instead, she\u2019s weeping and begging to live while rocks crush her. The pregnancy that supposedly was going to end in s7, which played no real role in s8, is what she\u2019s reduced to.</p><p>If you think that\u2019s how Cersei dies in the books, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.

He looked half a corpse himself. \u201cMonstrous,\u201d Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous.\u00a0</small></p><p><small>\u201cTwisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat.

He had been dead for years.\u201d\u00a0</small></p><p><small><i>Darkness</i>, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her. If she looked back she was lost. \u201cMy son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,\u201d she said. \u201cI could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.\u201d\u00a0</small></p><p><small>\u201cThat may be as it may be,\u201d answered Mirri Maz Duur, \u201cyet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said.

I want him.&rdquo; Her handmaid lowered her eyes. &ldquo;The boy &hellip; he did not live, Khaleesi.&rdquo; Her voice was a frightened whisper.&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>Dany released her wrist. <i>My son is dead</i>, she thought as Jhiqui left the tent. <b>She had known somehow.</b> She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui&rsquo;s tears. <b>No, she had known <i>before</i> she woke.</b> Her dream came back to her, sudden and vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid, bursting into flame. She should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in her dream, and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks. <i>All the grief has been burned out of me</i>, she told herself. She felt sad, and yet &hellip; <b>she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as if he had never been.</b></small></p><p><small>&nbsp;Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other dragon&rsquo;s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with, which was passing strange.&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Ser Jorah, come here,&rdquo; she said. She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls. &ldquo;What do you feel?&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Shell, hard as rock.&rdquo; The knight was wary. &ldquo;Scales.&rdquo;</small></p><p><small>&nbsp;&ldquo;Heat?&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;No. Cold stone.&rdquo; He took his hand away. &ldquo;Princess, are you well? Should you be up, weak as you are?&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Weak? <b>I am strong, Jorah.</b>&rdquo; To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions. &ldquo;Tell me how my child died.&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;He never lived, my princess. The women say &hellip;&rdquo; He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him, and the way he limped when he moved.&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Tell me. Tell me what the women say.&rdquo; He turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. &ldquo;They say the child was &hellip;&rdquo; She waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He looked half a corpse himself. &ldquo;Monstrous,&rdquo; Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous.&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small><i>Darkness</i>, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her. If she looked back she was lost. &ldquo;My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.&rdquo;&nbsp;</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;That may be as it may be,&rdquo; answered Mirri Maz Duur, &ldquo;yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said. Death was in that tent, Khaleesi.&rdquo;</small></p></blockquote><p><small>Rhaego<i> is </i>the dragon eggs, Rhaego <i>is</i> Daenerys, Daenerys <i>is</i> the last, the true dragon. The dragons hatching is birth, re-birth - Daenerys subconsciously agreed to sacrificing her child to hatch her dragon children, sacrificed the meek little girl that she was to become the true dragon.</small></p><p><small>Daenerys has subconsciously thought of self heras the last dragon, the true dragon since even her earliest chapters. She knew the price, her&nbsp;&lsquo;child&rsquo; - not to saving Drogo, but to hatching-birthing <i>herself</i> - even if she did not want to admit it herself, if I look back I am lost, and <i>agreed</i>. Rhaego is the most literal representation of Daenerys herself, of Daenerys Targaryen the Mother of Dragons. I think the line&nbsp;&ldquo;She could feel Rhaego receding as if he had never been&rdquo; telling - also, Daenerys found out she was pregnant <i>on</i> her birthday.</small></p><p><small>Daenerys subconsciously AGREED to sacrificing Rhaego to hatch the dragon eggs, not to save Drogo - she asked after the dragon eggs before she did Rhaego. She knew the price and paid it but couldn&rsquo;t admit it to herself. Yes, Daenerys did not want to go into the Mirri Maz Duur&rsquo;s tent - &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she wept, &ldquo;no, please, stop it, <b>it&rsquo;s too high, the price is too high</b>.&rdquo; happens BEFORE she enters the tent.</small></p><p><small>&ldquo;Weak? I am strong, Jorah.&rdquo; Daenerys draws strength from the dragon eggs, and the dragon dreams leave her feeling&nbsp;&lsquo;strong, fierce&rsquo;.<br /></small></p><p><small>Note: the language used,&nbsp;&ldquo;the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks&rdquo; is very similar to&nbsp;&ldquo; &lsquo;Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was &hellip; her name &hellip;&rsquo; Dany could not recall the child&rsquo;s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears&nbsp;had not been burned away. &lsquo;I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.&rsquo;\"&nbsp;</small></p></p>",
