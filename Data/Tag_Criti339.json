Caleb makes an interested sound, tugging the bag toward him and rummaging for the other half.\u00a0\u201cIs your stomach thing getting better?\u201d</p><p>Caleb feels a mild rush of embarrassment, but it\u2019s more minor than it would have been several weeks ago. The entire group seems to have settled on offering to share what food they\u2019ve got, happy when he eats full portions and not pressuring him when he can\u2019t. It\u2019s a lot less confrontational than what he gets at home, and he feels a little silly for expecting outsiders to treat him the same as his parents.\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d he says honestly.\u00a0\u201cI think um, just unpacking&hellip; knowing my school schedule&hellip; understanding more English&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing settled,\u201d Molly finishes for him. Caleb nods.<br/></p><p>\u201cYes, good word. Settled.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIs it that new things, um, stress you out, or was it specifically moving from Germany to here?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMuch more the second thing.\u201d Caleb tucks some hair behind his ear, taking a deep breath and looking around a little. He can smell faint tobacco smoke from the alley they went in - it seems like the employees take their breaks there instead of up here, and so it\u2019s unsurprising that they haven\u2019t seen anyone else come up. That\u2019s probably why Molly picked it.</p><p>\u201cDid you move for work?\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb blinks, a little too lost in thought to make sense of the question.</p><p>Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI mean, your dad, or your mom, did they have to move here for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Caleb laughs softly.\u00a0\u201cTheir jobs here are&hellip; are not better, I think they are, they, they are much worse, actually.\u201d He unwraps his sub and takes a few bites.<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making the best conversation to get you hungry, am I.\u201d Molly rubs his horn and looks away.<br/></p><p>Caleb wants little more in life than to keep Molly from being sad.\u00a0\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d he says around a mouthful of meatball.\u00a0\u201cDid&hellip; you&hellip; mag&hellip;dese?\u201d</p><p>Molly laughs.\u00a0\u201cYeah, my own secret recipe. I wanted us to have some hot food but I can\u2019t make much.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shakes his head and makes a thumbs up sign, glowering at his thumb when he sees that it\u2019s already got a streak of red sauce on it.</p><p>\u201cOh! Here, hold on.\u201d Molly sorts through the bag, pulling out a large plastic chip clip that\u2019s holding on to a small stack of paper napkins. He pulls a couple out and then sets the clip on the table between them. Caleb\u2019s just finished cleaning himself up when his phone chirps.<br/></p><p><b>Nott (green fist emoji): sup</b></p><p>Caleb grins at his phone.\u00a0\u201cI am going to take a picture and send it to Nott,\u201d he says, and stands up to take a top-down photo of the items spread out on the table. Molly starts to lean back, getting his folded arms out of the shot.\u00a0\u201cNo, it is okay, you are part of the&hellip;\u201d Caleb blushes and Molly laughs, leaning in further and crossing his eyes at the camera lens. Caleb takes the picture.</p><p>\u201cWe should take a selfie later,\u201d Molly is saying, as Caleb clicks through the options to send the attachment to Nott.\u00a0\u201cMy Facebook profile picture is super old.\u201d He stops when Caleb freezes.\u00a0\u201cFriends take selfies together here, guy friends, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot go on Facebook,\u201d Caleb says too quickly.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I can. I can look at it but I cannot, no pictures.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly blinks.\u00a0\u201cEven if I don\u2019t tag you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would your parents even <i>know?</i>\u00a0I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole, I just&hellip;\u201d Molly gestures with the remains of his sandwich.\u00a0\u201cYou filled out that form to not be in the yearbook, and it\u2019s like, there are parts of it I don\u2019t get, I guess.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThose two things are not about my parents, exactly.\u201d Caleb looks down at his sub, sitting up a little straighter and making himself finish it before he says anything else that\u2019s going to send him into stomach cramps. He\u2019s almost done when he realizes Molly hasn\u2019t said anything, is waiting on him, aware that there\u2019s more.\u00a0\u201cI cannot have my face show up on the internet. Neither can my parents. We came to America because we could not hide well in Germany.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly\u2019s voice gets quiet.\u00a0\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb crumples up his tinfoil very carefully, turning the corners inward and then the corners made by that, over and over.\u00a0\u201cIt is not, we are not terrorists or something. The German government is not mad at us.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt is hard to explain and I have not told anyone yet. I do not want people to know. I had to&hellip; there is a queue you must wait in, they decide if you can m-move to the U.S. and we had to go quickly so, so I made up, I.\u201d Caleb takes in a shuddering breath and realizes he\u2019s trembling a little. He tries to complete the sentence, but his mouth opens and nothing comes out. The table shifts a little as Molly gets up, and Caleb looks up and sees Molly rushing around the side to scoot in next to him, grabbing his hand on the table and squeezing it.<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you having a panic attack?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Caleb says, and laughs a little desperately.\u00a0\u201cI am sorry&hellip; this&hellip; it is all very&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly shakes his head several times, then tilts his head so his left horn is resting gently against Caleb\u2019s right temple. \u201cUm. I can\u2019t remember anything from before I was fourteen.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb inhales slowly.\u00a0\u201cA&hellip; again, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything from my life from before I was fourteen. I only remember things from age fourteen to now.\u201d Molly\u2019s face isn\u2019t visible to Caleb right now, but he sounds like he\u2019s smiling and also like he\u2019s kind of hurt.\u00a0\u201cDoes that help? I\u2019m not trying to one-up you, I\u2019m just. Trying to make sure you don\u2019t feel weird.\u201d<br/></p><p>That certainly wasn\u2019t what Caleb was expecting to hear.\u00a0\u201cYou&hellip; hit your head? Something hit your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly\u2019s thumb strokes over his fingers in slow, gentle sweeps.\u00a0\u201cThey did a bunch of scans because that\u2019s what everyone figured, but there was no, you know, internal swelling, or skull damage, or any brain damage&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Caleb sounds about as scared as he feels.<br/></p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no reason to think so.\u201d Molly pulls back and frowns at Caleb\u2019s expression \u201cI think I scared you worse. Shit.\u201d He laughs and shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I kind of panicked.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cBut that is real, what you said.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really real. I don\u2019t remember anything. They think it might be psychological but that\u2019s, like, impossible to rule out, so it\u2019s always on the table? If that makes sense?\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb tries to reach into his mind, searching for what he knows about memories and brains and&hellip;\u00a0\u201cTrauma, sometimes it gets locked up and you cannot &hellip; think of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike, to be fair, I was in a city famous for runaways and gay homeless kids who got one-way tickets from their families, so if something awful happened to me, I was in good company.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, one-way tickets, I do not understand.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike, if your shitty family finds out you\u2019re gay, they give you a one-way ticket to a big city and tell you to never come back&hellip;\u201d Molly nods at Caleb\u2019s disgusted expression.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThat is awful.\u201d Caleb tries to imagine this.\u00a0\u201cMy parents would never&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah, mine maybe did.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe they were great and died! Or, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Caleb tries to digest this.\u00a0\u201cWhat is your first memory?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cLike, a haze of a few days where I was lost and trying to find a familiar street, and then I gave up on that and begged, but that wasn\u2019t getting me much money&hellip;\u201d Molly peeks up, maybe gauging Caleb\u2019s reaction so far.\u00a0\u201cSome, um, some working girls found me&hellip; wandering around lost, so they sort of adopted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c&ndash;what?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cThey were like,\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re a kid! It\u2019s not safe out here!\u2019 They yelled at me and told me I was a fucking idiot and I could get hurt and&hellip; and they took me to a Waffle House and bought me like all the food I could eat.\u201d Molly sniffs. Caleb watches his face, the sad sort of calmness of it.\u00a0\u201cI stayed on one of their couches for a few weeks. I hung out with them a lot and one day they got busted and, um, and the cops thought I was, you know&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201c&hellip;also working?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly laughs.\u00a0\u201cI busked, sure. Other than that I was in their apartment. One of them had been making me watch <i>educational tv </i>to make up for the fact that I wasn\u2019t going to school. Like&hellip; yeah.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cDid you get arrested?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAt first? Sort of? They couldn\u2019t process me because I didn\u2019t have any ID or anything, and the cops, um, were mostly human, it was one of the tiefling girls that finally convinced them I was a young kid, and they did some blood test and were like,\u00a0\u2018oh, shit, you\u2019re a minor\u2019, and then my case changed departments like seven times&hellip; finally most of the girls got out by giving up dealers\u2019 names and I went into the foster system.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb frowns.\u00a0\u201cSo your name is&hellip;\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade up.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cThe girls called me\u00a0\u2018Empty Stomach\u2019, and then just \u2018Empty\u2019, and that sort of sounded like\u00a0\u2018M.T.\u2019, and so by the time the sting happened I was M.T. It\u2019s sort of dumb.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cIt is not dumb.\u201d Caleb turns his hand awkwardly under Molly\u2019s, wrapping his fingers around Molly\u2019s hand and squeezing it.\u00a0\u201cI like it a lot.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly snorts and ducks his head a little further. Caleb doubles down, switching his left hand to hold Molly\u2019s so he can reach out with his right hand, initiating a hug across the other boy\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever remember more pieces? Or is it just&hellip; not there?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cJust not there.\u201d Molly pulls his hand free, standing up - but it\u2019s only to pull his food to this side of the table, so he can resume eating without moving away. Caleb smiles.\u00a0\u201cMy memory of things now is pretty normal. There\u2019s just, you know, nothing before a certain time.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb ruminates over this for a while, taking a drink from his water bottle.\u00a0\u201cDo other people know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGustav knows. Yasha knows. Tova knows. Bosun and the twins don\u2019t.\u201d<br/></p><p>Caleb nods.\u00a0\u201cI will not say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>bad</i>, I\u2019m not embarrassed, it\u2019s just&hellip; weird.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike yours, I guess.\u201d When Caleb laughs hollowly, Molly hesitates.\u00a0\u201cYours&hellip; <i>is</i>\u00a0bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the \u2018huge mistake?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Molly frowns. \u201cThat you texted about? It\u2019s that? <i>You</i>\u00a0did -\u00a0 what the hell could you have done to make your family have to move?\u201d He pales a little and goes quiet.\u00a0\u201cDid you kill somebody by accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!? No.\u201d Caleb slouches on the bench.\u00a0\u201cI&hellip; my friends, we liked computers, and&hellip; we thought we were, you know, big shots.\u201d They were so stupid, Caleb thinks. They were <i>kids</i>.\u00a0\u201cWe had, you know, a computer club at school, we would use proxies and do whatever we wanted&hellip; we got dark web browsers and decided we would take down one of the little empires on there. They sold, um, very awful videos. And we tricked them and got some information on some of &hellip; of the people who made the videos, and leaked it to the police. They were busted. Nobody&hellip;\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYou were like <i>internet super heroes?</i>\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Caleb hits the table, making it reverberate.\u00a0\u201cWe were <i>idiots</i>. We could have died. They were criminals and they did not care, and, and, and they, they did not all, they were not all there, they were all in different countries. So some were arrested, the rest were very mad&hellip; they traced us, they started calling our houses, watching us on security cameras, they wanted us to pay.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cWe had to tell our parents what we did. Local police could not do anything, these men were in other countries, using spoof phone numbers, hiring&hellip;\u201d Caleb buries his face in his arms and shakes.<br/></p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d Molly\u2019s hand is light between his shoulder blades. Caleb tries to take full breaths, but he can\u2019t, so he just gasps for air as quietly as possible, over and over, until he feels an insistent swatting feeling on his thigh. When he moves his arms to see, it\u2019s Molly\u2019s tail, giving him the gentle little friendly smacks like during their lunches. In spite of himself, Caleb chokes out a brief laugh, and Molly tilts into him and covers his body with his.<br/></p><p>\u201cI do, I do not think I make much sense,\u201d Caleb mumbles into Molly\u2019s shirt.<br/></p><p>\u201cYou tried to stop some shitty people and they tried to get back at you?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t stop and the cops wouldn\u2019t help?\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb hiccups.\u00a0\u201cThey said they would poison my friend\u2019s family. And burn my house down. They had plans for all three of us.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly holds him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I am a big mess.\u201d Caleb can feel the perspiration covering his skin getting Molly\u2019s shirt damp.\u00a0\u201cI think maybe I am not good for dating.\u201d<br/></p><p>Molly is still for a moment, then tucks his head in carefully, pressing his lips to a spot on Caleb\u2019s neck.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to keep trying until we\u2019ve both run out of crazy fucking stories.\u201d</p>",

Caleb\u2019s just finished cleaning himself up when his phone chirps.<br></p><p><b>Nott (green fist emoji): sup</b></p><p>Caleb grins at his phone.\u00a0\u201cI am going to take a picture and send it to Nott,\u201d he says, and stands up to take a top-down photo of the items spread out on the table. Molly starts to lean back, getting his folded arms out of the shot.\u00a0\u201cNo, it is okay, you are part of the\u2026\u201d Caleb blushes and Molly laughs, leaning in further and crossing his eyes at the camera lens. Caleb takes the picture.</p><p>\u201cWe should take a selfie later,\u201d Molly is saying, as Caleb clicks through the options to send the attachment to Nott.\u00a0\u201cMy Facebook profile picture is super old.\u201d He stops when Caleb freezes.\u00a0\u201cFriends take selfies together here, guy friends, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot go on Facebook,\u201d Caleb says too quickly.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I can. I can look at it but I cannot, no pictures.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly blinks.\u00a0\u201cEven if I don\u2019t tag you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would your parents even <i>know?</i>\u00a0I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole, I just\u2026\u201d Molly gestures with the remains of his sandwich.\u00a0\u201cYou filled out that form to not be in the yearbook, and it\u2019s like, there are parts of it I don\u2019t get, I guess.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThose two things are not about my parents, exactly.\u201d Caleb looks down at his sub, sitting up a little straighter and making himself finish it before he says anything else that\u2019s going to send him into stomach cramps. He\u2019s almost done when he realizes Molly hasn\u2019t said anything, is waiting on him, aware that there\u2019s more.\u00a0\u201cI cannot have my face show up on the internet. Neither can my parents. We came to America because we could not hide well in Germany.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly\u2019s voice gets quiet.\u00a0\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb crumples up his tinfoil very carefully, turning the corners inward and then the corners made by that, over and over.\u00a0\u201cIt is not, we are not terrorists or something. The German government is not mad at us.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIt is hard to explain and I have not told anyone yet. I do not want people to know. I had to\u2026 there is a queue you must wait in, they decide if you can m-move to the U.S. and we had to go quickly so, so I made up, I.\u201d Caleb takes in a shuddering breath and realizes he\u2019s trembling a little. He tries to complete the sentence, but his mouth opens and nothing comes out. The table shifts a little as Molly gets up, and Caleb looks up and sees Molly rushing around the side to scoot in next to him, grabbing his hand on the table and squeezing it.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you having a panic attack?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Caleb says, and laughs a little desperately.\u00a0\u201cI am sorry\u2026 this\u2026 it is all very\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Molly shakes his head several times, then tilts his head so his left horn is resting gently against Caleb\u2019s right temple. \u201cUm. I can\u2019t remember anything from before I was fourteen.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb inhales slowly.\u00a0\u201cA\u2026 again, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything from my life from before I was fourteen. I only remember things from age fourteen to now.\u201d Molly\u2019s face isn\u2019t visible to Caleb right now, but he sounds like he\u2019s smiling and also like he\u2019s kind of hurt.\u00a0\u201cDoes that help? I\u2019m not trying to one-up you, I\u2019m just. Trying to make sure you don\u2019t feel weird.\u201d<br></p><p>That certainly wasn\u2019t what Caleb was expecting to hear.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 hit your head? Something hit your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly\u2019s thumb strokes over his fingers in slow, gentle sweeps.\u00a0\u201cThey did a bunch of scans because that\u2019s what everyone figured, but there was no, you know, internal swelling, or skull damage, or any brain damage\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Caleb sounds about as scared as he feels.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no reason to think so.\u201d Molly pulls back and frowns at Caleb\u2019s expression \u201cI think I scared you worse. Shit.\u201d He laughs and shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I kind of panicked.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut that is real, what you said.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really real. I don\u2019t remember anything. They think it might be psychological but that\u2019s, like, impossible to rule out, so it\u2019s always on the table? If that makes sense?\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb tries to reach into his mind, searching for what he knows about memories and brains and\u2026\u00a0\u201cTrauma, sometimes it gets locked up and you cannot \u2026 think of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike, to be fair, I was in a city famous for runaways and gay homeless kids who got one-way tickets from their families, so if something awful happened to me, I was in good company.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, one-way tickets, I do not understand.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike, if your shitty family finds out you\u2019re gay, they give you a one-way ticket to a big city and tell you to never come back\u2026\u201d Molly nods at Caleb\u2019s disgusted expression.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat is awful.\u201d Caleb tries to imagine this.\u00a0\u201cMy parents would never\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, mine maybe did.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe they were great and died! Or, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Caleb tries to digest this.\u00a0\u201cWhat is your first memory?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike, a haze of a few days where I was lost and trying to find a familiar street, and then I gave up on that and begged, but that wasn\u2019t getting me much money\u2026\u201d Molly peeks up, maybe gauging Caleb\u2019s reaction so far.\u00a0\u201cSome, um, some working girls found me\u2026 wandering around lost, so they sort of adopted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2013what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey were like,\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re a kid! It\u2019s not safe out here!\u2019 They yelled at me and told me I was a fucking idiot and I could get hurt and\u2026 and they took me to a Waffle House and bought me like all the food I could eat.\u201d Molly sniffs. Caleb watches his face, the sad sort of calmness of it.\u00a0\u201cI stayed on one of their couches for a few weeks. I hung out with them a lot and one day they got busted and, um, and the cops thought I was, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026also working?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly laughs.\u00a0\u201cI busked, sure. Other than that I was in their apartment. One of them had been making me watch <i>educational tv </i>to make up for the fact that I wasn\u2019t going to school. Like\u2026 yeah.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you get arrested?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAt first? Sort of? They couldn\u2019t process me because I didn\u2019t have any ID or anything, and the cops, um, were mostly human, it was one of the tiefling girls that finally convinced them I was a young kid, and they did some blood test and were like,\u00a0\u2018oh, shit, you\u2019re a minor\u2019, and then my case changed departments like seven times\u2026 finally most of the girls got out by giving up dealers\u2019 names and I went into the foster system.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb frowns.\u00a0\u201cSo your name is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade up.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cThe girls called me\u00a0\u2018Empty Stomach\u2019, and then just \u2018Empty\u2019, and that sort of sounded like\u00a0\u2018M.T.\u2019, and so by the time the sting happened I was M.T. It\u2019s sort of dumb.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt is not dumb.\u201d Caleb turns his hand awkwardly under Molly\u2019s, wrapping his fingers around Molly\u2019s hand and squeezing it.\u00a0\u201cI like it a lot.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly snorts and ducks his head a little further. Caleb doubles down, switching his left hand to hold Molly\u2019s so he can reach out with his right hand, initiating a hug across the other boy\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever remember more pieces? Or is it just\u2026 not there?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust not there.\u201d Molly pulls his hand free, standing up - but it\u2019s only to pull his food to this side of the table, so he can resume eating without moving away. Caleb smiles.\u00a0\u201cMy memory of things now is pretty normal. There\u2019s just, you know, nothing before a certain time.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb ruminates over this for a while, taking a drink from his water bottle.\u00a0\u201cDo other people know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGustav knows. Yasha knows. Tova knows. Bosun and the twins don\u2019t.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb nods.\u00a0\u201cI will not say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>bad</i>, I\u2019m not embarrassed, it\u2019s just\u2026 weird.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike yours, I guess.\u201d When Caleb laughs hollowly, Molly hesitates.\u00a0\u201cYours\u2026 <i>is</i>\u00a0bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the \u2018huge mistake?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Molly frowns. \u201cThat you texted about? It\u2019s that? <i>You</i>\u00a0did -\u00a0 what the hell could you have done to make your family have to move?\u201d He pales a little and goes quiet.\u00a0\u201cDid you kill somebody by accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!? No.\u201d Caleb slouches on the bench.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 my friends, we liked computers, and\u2026 we thought we were, you know, big shots.\u201d They were so stupid, Caleb thinks. They were <i>kids</i>.\u00a0\u201cWe had, you know, a computer club at school, we would use proxies and do whatever we wanted\u2026 we got dark web browsers and decided we would take down one of the little empires on there. They sold, um, very awful videos. And we tricked them and got some information on some of \u2026 of the people who made the videos, and leaked it to the police. They were busted. Nobody\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou were like <i>internet super heroes?</i>\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Caleb hits the table, making it reverberate.\u00a0\u201cWe were <i>idiots</i>. We could have died. They were criminals and they did not care, and, and, and they, they did not all, they were not all there, they were all in different countries. So some were arrested, the rest were very mad\u2026 they traced us, they started calling our houses, watching us on security cameras, they wanted us to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe had to tell our parents what we did. Local police could not do anything, these men were in other countries, using spoof phone numbers, hiring\u2026\u201d Caleb buries his face in his arms and shakes.<br></p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d Molly\u2019s hand is light between his shoulder blades. Caleb tries to take full breaths, but he can\u2019t, so he just gasps for air as quietly as possible, over and over, until he feels an insistent swatting feeling on his thigh. When he moves his arms to see, it\u2019s Molly\u2019s tail, giving him the gentle little friendly smacks like during their lunches. In spite of himself, Caleb chokes out a brief laugh, and Molly tilts into him and covers his body with his.<br></p><p>\u201cI do, I do not think I make much sense,\u201d Caleb mumbles into Molly\u2019s shirt.<br></p><p>\u201cYou tried to stop some shitty people and they tried to get back at you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t stop and the cops wouldn\u2019t help?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb hiccups.\u00a0\u201cThey said they would poison my friend\u2019s family. And burn my house down. They had plans for all three of us.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly holds him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I am a big mess.\u201d Caleb can feel the perspiration covering his skin getting Molly\u2019s shirt damp.\u00a0\u201cI think maybe I am not good for dating.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly is still for a moment, then tucks his head in carefully, pressing his lips to a spot on Caleb\u2019s neck.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to keep trying until we\u2019ve both run out of crazy fucking stories.\u201d</p>",

Medium lights?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWith the lights dimmed?\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb nods.\u00a0\u201cWith the lights dimmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a single tea light in the middle of the table,\u201d Molly adds in a serious hush, pretending to cup his hands around a tiny candle between them.\u00a0\u201cTo roast\u2026 your tiny fancy restaurant marshmallows on.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb snorts.\u00a0\u201cOn toothpicks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Molly agrees.\u00a0\u201cYou could use the ones that come in hot chocolate mix.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNein, those are\u2026 too hard, they are like sugary American cereal pieces.

Those are not marshmallows!\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 marshmallow\u2026 inspired?\u201d Molly pulls out something wrapped in foil, and it turns out to be half a meatball sub. Caleb makes an interested sound, tugging the bag toward him and rummaging for the other half.\u00a0\u201cIs your stomach thing getting better?\u201d</p><p>Caleb feels a mild rush of embarrassment, but it\u2019s more minor than it would have been several weeks ago. The entire group seems to have settled on offering to share what food they\u2019ve got, happy when he eats full portions and not pressuring him when he can\u2019t. It\u2019s a lot less confrontational than what he gets at home, and he feels a little silly for expecting outsiders to treat him the same as his parents.\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d he says honestly.\u00a0\u201cI think um, just unpacking\u2026 knowing my school schedule\u2026 understanding more English\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing settled,\u201d Molly finishes for him.

Settled.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIs it that new things, um, stress you out, or was it specifically moving from Germany to here?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMuch more the second thing.\u201d Caleb tucks some hair behind his ear, taking a deep breath and looking around a little. He can smell faint tobacco smoke from the alley they went in - it seems like the employees take their breaks there instead of up here, and so it\u2019s unsurprising that they haven\u2019t seen anyone else come up. That\u2019s probably why Molly picked it.</p><p>\u201cDid you move for work?\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb blinks, a little too lost in thought to make sense of the question.</p><p>Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cI mean, your dad, or your mom, did they have to move here for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Caleb laughs softly.\u00a0\u201cTheir jobs here are\u2026 are not better, I think they are, they, they are much worse, actually.\u201d He unwraps his sub and takes a few bites.<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making the best conversation to get you hungry, am I.\u201d Molly rubs his horn and looks away.<br></p><p>Caleb wants little more in life than to keep Molly from being sad.\u00a0\u201cS\u2019ok,\u201d he says around a mouthful of meatball.\u00a0\u201cDid\u2026 you\u2026 mag\u2026dese?\u201d</p><p>Molly laughs.\u00a0\u201cYeah, my own secret recipe.

Here, hold on.\u201d Molly sorts through the bag, pulling out a large plastic chip clip that\u2019s holding on to a small stack of paper napkins. He pulls a couple out and then sets the clip on the table between them. Caleb\u2019s just finished cleaning himself up when his phone chirps.<br></p><p><b>Nott (green fist emoji): sup</b></p><p>Caleb grins at his phone.\u00a0\u201cI am going to take a picture and send it to Nott,\u201d he says, and stands up to take a top-down photo of the items spread out on the table. Molly starts to lean back, getting his folded arms out of the shot.\u00a0\u201cNo, it is okay, you are part of the\u2026\u201d Caleb blushes and Molly laughs, leaning in further and crossing his eyes at the camera lens. Caleb takes the picture.</p><p>\u201cWe should take a selfie later,\u201d Molly is saying, as Caleb clicks through the options to send the attachment to Nott.\u00a0\u201cMy Facebook profile picture is super old.\u201d He stops when Caleb freezes.\u00a0\u201cFriends take selfies together here, guy friends, it\u2019s-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot go on Facebook,\u201d Caleb says too quickly.\u00a0\u201cI mean, I can.

Neither can my parents. We came to America because we could not hide well in Germany.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly\u2019s voice gets quiet.\u00a0\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb crumples up his tinfoil very carefully, turning the corners inward and then the corners made by that, over and over.\u00a0\u201cIt is not, we are not terrorists or something.

He tries to complete the sentence, but his mouth opens and nothing comes out. The table shifts a little as Molly gets up, and Caleb looks up and sees Molly rushing around the side to scoot in next to him, grabbing his hand on the table and squeezing it.<br></p><p>\u201cAre you having a panic attack?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Caleb says, and laughs a little desperately.\u00a0\u201cI am sorry\u2026 this\u2026 it is all very\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>Molly shakes his head several times, then tilts his head so his left horn is resting gently against Caleb\u2019s right temple. \u201cUm. I can\u2019t remember anything from before I was fourteen.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb inhales slowly.\u00a0\u201cA\u2026 again, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything from my life from before I was fourteen. I only remember things from age fourteen to now.\u201d Molly\u2019s face isn\u2019t visible to Caleb right now, but he sounds like he\u2019s smiling and also like he\u2019s kind of hurt.\u00a0\u201cDoes that help? I\u2019m not trying to one-up you, I\u2019m just. Trying to make sure you don\u2019t feel weird.\u201d<br></p><p>That certainly wasn\u2019t what Caleb was expecting to hear.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 hit your head? Something hit your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Molly\u2019s thumb strokes over his fingers in slow, gentle sweeps.\u00a0\u201cThey did a bunch of scans because that\u2019s what everyone figured, but there was no, you know, internal swelling, or skull damage, or any brain damage\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Caleb sounds about as scared as he feels.<br></p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no reason to think so.\u201d Molly pulls back and frowns at Caleb\u2019s expression \u201cI think I scared you worse. Shit.\u201d He laughs and shakes his head.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I kind of panicked.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cBut that is real, what you said.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really real. I don\u2019t remember anything. They think it might be psychological but that\u2019s, like, impossible to rule out, so it\u2019s always on the table? If that makes sense?\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb tries to reach into his mind, searching for what he knows about memories and brains and\u2026\u00a0\u201cTrauma, sometimes it gets locked up and you cannot \u2026 think of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike, to be fair, I was in a city famous for runaways and gay homeless kids who got one-way tickets from their families, so if something awful happened to me, I was in good company.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, one-way tickets, I do not understand.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike, if your shitty family finds out you\u2019re gay, they give you a one-way ticket to a big city and tell you to never come back\u2026\u201d Molly nods at Caleb\u2019s disgusted expression.\u00a0\u201cYeah.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThat is awful.\u201d Caleb tries to imagine this.\u00a0\u201cMy parents would never\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah, mine maybe did.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cOr maybe they were great and died! Or, I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Caleb tries to digest this.\u00a0\u201cWhat is your first memory?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cLike, a haze of a few days where I was lost and trying to find a familiar street, and then I gave up on that and begged, but that wasn\u2019t getting me much money\u2026\u201d Molly peeks up, maybe gauging Caleb\u2019s reaction so far.\u00a0\u201cSome, um, some working girls found me\u2026 wandering around lost, so they sort of adopted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2013what?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cThey were like,\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re a kid! It\u2019s not safe out here!\u2019 They yelled at me and told me I was a fucking idiot and I could get hurt and\u2026 and they took me to a Waffle House and bought me like all the food I could eat.\u201d Molly sniffs. Caleb watches his face, the sad sort of calmness of it.\u00a0\u201cI stayed on one of their couches for a few weeks. I hung out with them a lot and one day they got busted and, um, and the cops thought I was, you know\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2026also working?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Molly laughs.\u00a0\u201cI busked, sure. Other than that I was in their apartment. One of them had been making me watch <i>educational tv </i>to make up for the fact that I wasn\u2019t going to school. Like\u2026 yeah.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cDid you get arrested?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAt first? Sort of? They couldn\u2019t process me because I didn\u2019t have any ID or anything, and the cops, um, were mostly human, it was one of the tiefling girls that finally convinced them I was a young kid, and they did some blood test and were like,\u00a0\u2018oh, shit, you\u2019re a minor\u2019, and then my case changed departments like seven times\u2026 finally most of the girls got out by giving up dealers\u2019 names and I went into the foster system.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb frowns.\u00a0\u201cSo your name is\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade up.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cThe girls called me\u00a0\u2018Empty Stomach\u2019, and then just \u2018Empty\u2019, and that sort of sounded like\u00a0\u2018M.T.\u2019, and so by the time the sting happened I was M.T. It\u2019s sort of dumb.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cIt is not dumb.\u201d Caleb turns his hand awkwardly under Molly\u2019s, wrapping his fingers around Molly\u2019s hand and squeezing it.\u00a0\u201cI like it a lot.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly snorts and ducks his head a little further. Caleb doubles down, switching his left hand to hold Molly\u2019s so he can reach out with his right hand, initiating a hug across the other boy\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever remember more pieces? Or is it just\u2026 not there?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cJust not there.\u201d Molly pulls his hand free, standing up - but it\u2019s only to pull his food to this side of the table, so he can resume eating without moving away. Caleb smiles.\u00a0\u201cMy memory of things now is pretty normal. There\u2019s just, you know, nothing before a certain time.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb ruminates over this for a while, taking a drink from his water bottle.\u00a0\u201cDo other people know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGustav knows. Yasha knows. Tova knows. Bosun and the twins don\u2019t.\u201d<br></p><p>Caleb nods.\u00a0\u201cI will not say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>bad</i>, I\u2019m not embarrassed, it\u2019s just\u2026 weird.\u201d Molly shrugs.\u00a0\u201cLike yours, I guess.\u201d When Caleb laughs hollowly, Molly hesitates.\u00a0\u201cYours\u2026 <i>is</i>\u00a0bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the \u2018huge mistake?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Molly frowns. \u201cThat you texted about? It\u2019s that? <i>You</i>\u00a0did -\u00a0 what the hell could you have done to make your family have to move?\u201d He pales a little and goes quiet.\u00a0\u201cDid you kill somebody by accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!? No.\u201d Caleb slouches on the bench.\u00a0\u201cI\u2026 my friends, we liked computers, and\u2026 we thought we were, you know, big shots.\u201d They were so stupid, Caleb thinks. They were <i>kids</i>.\u00a0\u201cWe had, you know, a computer club at school, we would use proxies and do whatever we wanted\u2026 we got dark web browsers and decided we would take down one of the little empires on there. They sold, um, very awful videos. And we tricked them and got some information on some of \u2026 of the people who made the videos, and leaked it to the police. They were busted. Nobody\u2026\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYou were like <i>internet super heroes?</i>\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Caleb hits the table, making it reverberate.\u00a0\u201cWe were <i>idiots</i>. We could have died. They were criminals and they did not care, and, and, and they, they did not all, they were not all there, they were all in different countries. So some were arrested, the rest were very mad\u2026 they traced us, they started calling our houses, watching us on security cameras, they wanted us to pay.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cWe had to tell our parents what we did. Local police could not do anything, these men were in other countries, using spoof phone numbers, hiring\u2026\u201d Caleb buries his face in his arms and shakes.<br></p><p>\u201cCaleb.\u201d Molly\u2019s hand is light between his shoulder blades. Caleb tries to take full breaths, but he can\u2019t, so he just gasps for air as quietly as possible, over and over, until he feels an insistent swatting feeling on his thigh. When he moves his arms to see, it\u2019s Molly\u2019s tail, giving him the gentle little friendly smacks like during their lunches. In spite of himself, Caleb chokes out a brief laugh, and Molly tilts into him and covers his body with his.<br></p><p>\u201cI do, I do not think I make much sense,\u201d Caleb mumbles into Molly\u2019s shirt.<br></p><p>\u201cYou tried to stop some shitty people and they tried to get back at you?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t stop and the cops wouldn\u2019t help?\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Caleb hiccups.\u00a0\u201cThey said they would poison my friend\u2019s family. And burn my house down. They had plans for all three of us.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly holds him tighter.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I am a big mess.\u201d Caleb can feel the perspiration covering his skin getting Molly\u2019s shirt damp.\u00a0\u201cI think maybe I am not good for dating.\u201d<br></p><p>Molly is still for a moment, then tucks his head in carefully, pressing his lips to a spot on Caleb\u2019s neck.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to keep trying until we\u2019ve both run out of crazy fucking stories.\u201d</p>",

Caleb shrugs and tries to think.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Same thing as Americans, I guess. Kids go to movies. Adults go to restaurants with the lights at&hellip; hmm. Medium lights?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;With the lights dimmed?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb nods.&nbsp;&ldquo;With the lights dimmed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And a single tea light in the middle of the table,&rdquo; Molly adds in a serious hush, pretending to cup his hands around a tiny candle between them.&nbsp;&ldquo;To roast&hellip; your tiny fancy restaurant marshmallows on.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb snorts.&nbsp;&ldquo;On toothpicks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Molly agrees.&nbsp;&ldquo;You could use the ones that come in hot chocolate mix.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Nein, those are&hellip; too hard, they are like sugary American cereal pieces. What is that brand Jester tried to - oh, Lucky Charms. Those are not marshmallows!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re&hellip; marshmallow&hellip; inspired?&rdquo; Molly pulls out something wrapped in foil, and it turns out to be half a meatball sub. Caleb makes an interested sound, tugging the bag toward him and rummaging for the other half.&nbsp;&ldquo;Is your stomach thing getting better?&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb feels a mild rush of embarrassment, but it&rsquo;s more minor than it would have been several weeks ago. The entire group seems to have settled on offering to share what food they&rsquo;ve got, happy when he eats full portions and not pressuring him when he can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a lot less confrontational than what he gets at home, and he feels a little silly for expecting outsiders to treat him the same as his parents.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says honestly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think um, just unpacking&hellip; knowing my school schedule&hellip; understanding more English&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Being settled,&rdquo; Molly finishes for him. Caleb nods.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes, good word. Settled.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Is it that new things, um, stress you out, or was it specifically moving from Germany to here?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Much more the second thing.&rdquo; Caleb tucks some hair behind his ear, taking a deep breath and looking around a little. He can smell faint tobacco smoke from the alley they went in - it seems like the employees take their breaks there instead of up here, and so it&rsquo;s unsurprising that they haven&rsquo;t seen anyone else come up. That&rsquo;s probably why Molly picked it.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you move for work?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb blinks, a little too lost in thought to make sense of the question.</p><p>Molly shrugs.&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, your dad, or your mom, did they have to move here for a job.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Caleb laughs softly.&nbsp;&ldquo;Their jobs here are&hellip; are not better, I think they are, they, they are much worse, actually.&rdquo; He unwraps his sub and takes a few bites.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making the best conversation to get you hungry, am I.&rdquo; Molly rubs his horn and looks away.<br /></p><p>Caleb wants little more in life than to keep Molly from being sad.&nbsp;&ldquo;S&rsquo;ok,&rdquo; he says around a mouthful of meatball.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did&hellip; you&hellip; mag&hellip;dese?&rdquo;</p><p>Molly laughs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, my own secret recipe. I wanted us to have some hot food but I can&rsquo;t make much.&rdquo;</p><p>Caleb shakes his head and makes a thumbs up sign, glowering at his thumb when he sees that it&rsquo;s already got a streak of red sauce on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Here, hold on.&rdquo; Molly sorts through the bag, pulling out a large plastic chip clip that&rsquo;s holding on to a small stack of paper napkins. He pulls a couple out and then sets the clip on the table between them. Caleb&rsquo;s just finished cleaning himself up when his phone chirps.<br /></p><p><b>Nott (green fist emoji): sup</b></p><p>Caleb grins at his phone.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am going to take a picture and send it to Nott,&rdquo; he says, and stands up to take a top-down photo of the items spread out on the table.

It&rsquo;s sort of dumb.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;It is not dumb.&rdquo; Caleb turns his hand awkwardly under Molly&rsquo;s, wrapping his fingers around Molly&rsquo;s hand and squeezing it.&nbsp;&ldquo;I like it a lot.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Molly snorts and ducks his head a little further. Caleb doubles down, switching his left hand to hold Molly&rsquo;s so he can reach out with his right hand, initiating a hug across the other boy&rsquo;s shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever remember more pieces? Or is it just&hellip; not there?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Just not there.&rdquo; Molly pulls his hand free, standing up - but it&rsquo;s only to pull his food to this side of the table, so he can resume eating without moving away. Caleb smiles.&nbsp;&ldquo;My memory of things now is pretty normal. There&rsquo;s just, you know, nothing before a certain time.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb ruminates over this for a while, taking a drink from his water bottle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do other people know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gustav knows. Yasha knows. Tova knows. Bosun and the twins don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Caleb nods.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will not say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>bad</i>, I&rsquo;m not embarrassed, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; weird.&rdquo; Molly shrugs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like yours, I guess.&rdquo; When Caleb laughs hollowly, Molly hesitates.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yours&hellip; <i>is</i>&nbsp;bad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remember the &lsquo;huge mistake?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Molly frowns. &ldquo;That you texted about? It&rsquo;s that? <i>You</i>&nbsp;did -&nbsp; what the hell could you have done to make your family have to move?&rdquo; He pales a little and goes quiet.&nbsp;&ldquo;Did you kill somebody by accident?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!? No.&rdquo; Caleb slouches on the bench.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&hellip; my friends, we liked computers, and&hellip; we thought we were, you know, big shots.&rdquo; They were so stupid, Caleb thinks. They were <i>kids</i>.&nbsp;&ldquo;We had, you know, a computer club at school, we would use proxies and do whatever we wanted&hellip; we got dark web browsers and decided we would take down one of the little empires on there. They sold, um, very awful videos. And we tricked them and got some information on some of &hellip; of the people who made the videos, and leaked it to the police. They were busted. Nobody&hellip;&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You were like <i>internet super heroes?</i>&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Caleb hits the table, making it reverberate.&nbsp;&ldquo;We were <i>idiots</i>. We could have died. They were criminals and they did not care, and, and, and they, they did not all, they were not all there, they were all in different countries. So some were arrested, the rest were very mad&hellip; they traced us, they started calling our houses, watching us on security cameras, they wanted us to pay.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Holy shit.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;We had to tell our parents what we did. Local police could not do anything, these men were in other countries, using spoof phone numbers, hiring&hellip;&rdquo; Caleb buries his face in his arms and shakes.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Caleb.&rdquo; Molly&rsquo;s hand is light between his shoulder blades. Caleb tries to take full breaths, but he can&rsquo;t, so he just gasps for air as quietly as possible, over and over, until he feels an insistent swatting feeling on his thigh. When he moves his arms to see, it&rsquo;s Molly&rsquo;s tail, giving him the gentle little friendly smacks like during their lunches. In spite of himself, Caleb chokes out a brief laugh, and Molly tilts into him and covers his body with his.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;I do, I do not think I make much sense,&rdquo; Caleb mumbles into Molly&rsquo;s shirt.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;You tried to stop some shitty people and they tried to get back at you?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;And they wouldn&rsquo;t stop and the cops wouldn&rsquo;t help?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Caleb hiccups.&nbsp;&ldquo;They said they would poison my friend&rsquo;s family. And burn my house down. They had plans for all three of us.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Molly holds him tighter.</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry I am a big mess.&rdquo; Caleb can feel the perspiration covering his skin getting Molly&rsquo;s shirt damp.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think maybe I am not good for dating.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Molly is still for a moment, then tucks his head in carefully, pressing his lips to a spot on Caleb&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to keep trying until we&rsquo;ve both run out of crazy fucking stories.&rdquo;</p>",
