Not that he isn\u2019t usually kind, but you felt assured that he\u2019s definitely got your back. Not only did he pick you up after you left him some cryptic message; he let you sleep in his bed while he took the couch (which you\u2019d been asking him to replace for a while now), he let you have the last earl grey teabag he had lying around in the kitchen, he let you choose the show you wanted to watch instead of letting him continue his F.R.I.E.N.D.S rerun. Hell, he even let you vent about the whole situation without interruption, even when you didn\u2019t understand yourself half the time from all the unfiltered thoughts shooting out in between sentences.</p><!-- more --><p>Ash himself? He didn\u2019t care too much for sleeping on his bed, or tea, or TV. He doesn\u2019t care much for Y/N either, really, but having you around was okay. At least he wasn\u2019t alone, and you could be really interesting sometimes. A part of him has some sort of adoration for you ever since you first established yourself to be a brilliant law student to your class and professors, but he\u2019s always seen you as an icky little sister more than anything else.</p><p>As you found yourself waking up in an unfamiliar bedroom, a wave of panic rushed through you until you caught sight of your dress hanging on the hook on the wall and you\u2019re reminded of last night\u2019s disaster. With a frown, a long exhale escapes your nostrils as you let yourself fall back onto\nthe pillows.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to face him, but you don\u2019t want to bother Ash either. You rake your hands through your messed-up hair and tug at your roots. You groan in even greater frustration when you think about having to go home in yesterday\u2019s outfit, and how bad that would look if pictures got out.</p><p>You stop yourself. There it is again. Your life has grown to revolve around his, and if that one thought doesn\u2019t prove it, you don\u2019t know what does. You sigh yet again, but you can\u2019t help that you automatically start desperately wishing that one of the Kardashians did something to throw a blanket over any news that could possibly have be published about your relationship in the last twelve hours.</p><p>For a moment you entertain the thought of going online and\nchecking out if any damage has been done. Somehow, it has never, ever kicked in for you, despite the countless times you\u2019ve done it, that going online when you\u2019re curious only ever leads to a complete plummet in your mood. You don\u2019t even remember how many times it\u2019s been that you\u2019d succumb to your curiosity, go onto Twitter to search up your name alongside Harry\u2019s, and instantly regret it when you make sense of all the hatred you get for being his girlfriend. Everything in you is itching to get online, and despite the protests in your head, you don\u2019t really stop yourself from reaching into your clutch to fish your phone out. You let it power on, and as you\u2019re about to yield to your craving for melodrama, your boyfriend\u2019s texts from last night sliding up and down your status bar stop you.</p><p><b><i>4 missed calls</i></b></p><p><i>[21:02]: I\u2019m so sorry, my love</i></p><p><i>[21:05]: Can we talk about this?</i></p><p><i>[21:24]: Where are you?</i></p><p><i>[22:19]: God, Y/N, please tell me you\u2019re safe.</i></p><p><i>[03:48]: I\u2019m so, so sorry. I love you. I have no right to ask you of this but I know you and I beg you to stay off the web. At least until we work it out.</i></p><p>A twang invades your chest as you register the urgency in his tone, and you feel your face contort into a saddened frown from the dilemma that brews in your entire being after reading his messages. Your despair is immediately replaced with anxiety when you notice three grey dots appear mere seconds after you\u2019ve read your messages.</p><p><i>[08:09]: I\u2019m so sorry.</i></p><p><i>[08:09]: And good morning, love.</i> </p><p>You swallow with difficulty and bite your bottom lip before it can sink any further. Your thumbs hover over the screen. On one hand, you\u2019re dying to let him know you\u2019re okay if it means he wouldn\u2019t worry about you. <i>Did he even sleep at all last night? </i>On the other hand, you selfishly want him to experience the sort of worry that you do for him, and if that means coldly refusing to respond to him, then so be it. </p><p>\u2026 Right?</p><p>You toss your phone back into your clutch before you can go back on your decision. As far as you\u2019re concerned, he is not getting an ounce of satisfaction out of this. It\u2019s unfair enough as it is \u2013 now that you\u2019ve read his texts, you know that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting any peace of mind in the next few hours\u2026 maybe even days.</p><p>The sun\u2019s rays beating the walls of the room ironically darkens your mood further. Of all the things you feel today, cheery is not one of them. Throwing the hoodie Ash lent you over your head and tightening the sweatpants he\u2019d let you borrow, you let the slippers shuffle you out of the bedroom.</p><p>You\u2019ve taken it upon yourself to get a steaming cup\u2019s equivalent of coffee in your veins within the next hour. You take lighter steps when you see your friend\u2019s half-naked body still slackened, loose and drooling in slumber, and a part of you wonders how he\u2019s able to sleep so well on that lumpy, older than Beethoven couch. Shaking your head, you create a mental note to bring him window-shopping for couches one of these days. Maybe even get him a proper couch yourself.</p><p>With the thought lingering in your head among other memories from the previous night, you mindlessly pull the utensils and ingredients for your coffee and brew a jug enough for you and the sleepyhead on the other side of the apartment, not realising until later when Ash mumbled something about the coffee being thick that you had brewed it the way you and Harry grew to love your morning cuppa.</p><br/><p>In the living room, you\u2019re cross-legged on the couch with Ash\u2019s laptop resting on your legs. You\u2019ve got your inbox open and you\u2019re\nsifting through your emails \u2013 yet, for someone who goes through emails like it\u2019s second nature, you were going through them at a suspiciously slow pace. Your glassy eyes staring at the corner of the laptop, you don\u2019t realise it, but your thoughts are still stuck in the darkness of yesterday.</p><p>Ash emerges from his bedroom carrying a gym bag. When he\ncatches your distracted statue on his couch, he detours to the kitchen instead of letting himself be seen as he wonders if he should ask you about it or simply flick your attention away from your thoughts. Grabbing a banana from the counter, he sighs as he watches the back of your head staring down at the stagnant screen, and he walks towards the entrance while clearing his throat. His little cough draws you away from your screen, and you look up to him with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019going to the gym for a while. Will you be fine on your own?\u201d he dips his head slightly, and you find his concerned hazel eyes examining yours. You acknowledge the flurry of things zooming through your head at his question \u2013 <i>On my own? I\u2019m not even fine with you here. But I can\u2019t possibly stop you from going, what good will that do? Y/N, just give him the easy answer \u2013 </i>and you\u2019re about to nod.</p><p>The ding of the doorbell brings both of your gazes to the door. A confused expression takes over your features as you turn back to him, but the single eyebrow he raises seems to prove that he\u2019s just as unsure as you are, and you\u2019re left to imagine it\u2019s a door-to-door salesman or a couple of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses preaching their Lord&rsquo;s word with every door that is opened.</p><p>You return to your emails with the intrusive thoughts invading your focus less this time, and this time you even manage to rapidly click away at the keyboard as you type a sentence in.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You look up again at Ash, who\u2019s leaning against the door and has his back turned towards you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry.\u201d</p><p>The two words are enough to make your head whirl and your breath shallow, and you have to lean back and clutch tightly to the fabric of your seat to stabilise yourself. Wild eyed, you shake your head at Ash and you begin to get up as you feel a cry slowly rising up your throat, carrying the laptop with you. You see him opening the door by a crack and you hear a muffled exchange, but you pull the bedroom door quietly shut before you can hear or see the one who brought you so much anger and hurt in the past 12 hours. </p><p><i>What the hell does he want? Why does he think it\u2019s okay to drag his ass all the way here? </i>Your feet, for whatever reason, bring you to the mirror on the wall, and your scowl only deepens when you see how horrid you look. Is this how you looked like last night, when you slammed the door in his face?</p><p>You can feel your jaw beginning to tremble and a ghost of a sob lurking in the back of your throat, but sucking in a cool, deep breath through your parted lips, you flip your feelings before they can manifest in another wet fit. Instead, you tighten your hands into fists, revelling in the way angry, red semicircles form on the palms of your hand.</p><p>You\u2019re trying hard not to leave a scene for Ash to clean up after, but you can\u2019t help that you\u2019re yanking your phone from the charger as you think about how your life revolves around your boyfriend and how entitled he thinks he is, showing up at your best friend\u2019s house when you\u2019re trying to give him a taste of his own medicine with your absence. That\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t feel the tinge of pride and security, of course, that he\u2019s begging for you at the door right now. You kick your slippers off, aligning them one atop the other. </p><br/><p>The breath Harry had been holding comes out in a disappointed sigh when Ash opens the door instead of you. \u201cHey, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sup.\u201d Ash raises his eyebrows at the absurdity and irony of his own response. Despite your name being the tacit tension that makes the air thick between the two men, Ash doesn\u2019t succumb to his usual carefree self by inviting Harry in. Instead, the gap of the door remains small, and he finds himself straightening his back when he notices the unwelcome visitor straining his neck to search inside the apartment. Harry catches his gesture, reverting his piercing gaze to the man blocking his view and feeling the pride build up in his chest when he averts his sight quickly with a swallow.</p><p>\u201cLook, mate,\u201d Ash speaks up first, and he tries to keep his voice low since he knows you\u2019re in enough distress as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get in the middle of any of this, yeah? But she seems pissed with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know\u2014just\u2026\u201d he exhales, head hanging low and hands on his hips. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Ash observes the darkened bags under his bloodshot eyes, and\nhow he\u2019s just a little less unkempt than he normally is: the dress shirt he has on is crumpled and the cuffs aren\u2019t buttoned, his hair doesn\u2019t have the same neat messiness that\u2019s typical of him. \u201cS\u2019not for me to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I speak to her?\u201d he seizes the opportunity the\nmoment he hears the response, snapping up with hopeful eyes. Selfishly, he wishes that this is the one time his supposed universal charm works on his girlfriend\u2019s best friend, but when he sees him puffing his chest out a little, he knows it doesn\u2019t really work to his favour this time.</p><p>Ash doesn\u2019t expect that he has a protective streak for you, and he\u2019s certain he doesn\u2019t \u2013 yet he allows himself a small dig since you aren\u2019t around to reprimand him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen to her wishes, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, <i>bud</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him, Ash.\u201d</p><p>Both pair of eyes dart towards the sound of your voice, where you are strutting up to the door with an eye-roll and with your belongings bundled up in your hands. You\u2019ve changed back into your dress from the previous night, knowing full well there will be lenses outside ready to twist and publish the story into more than it actually is \u2013 just as you intend it to be, especially after the emotional hell you\u2019ve been put through by the wide-eyed moron on the other side of the door.</p><p>You bring a hand up to your friend\u2019s arm, sending him the most genuine half-smile you can muster, and you speak \u2013 despite the look of concern he gives you, and despite Harry listening. \u201cThanks for having my back, don\u2019t wanna keep bothering you. I owe you one, yeah? I left your clothes in the\nlaundry bag,\u201d you proceed forward, but halt as an afterthought pops into your head, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll get you more teabags next time, and we <i>will</i> find you a better couch, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d he simply replies, and he taps at his forehead four times, <i>I\u2019ll be right here.</i> A tiny exhale of a laugh escapes your lips at the understanding of your E.T. inside joke being communicated to you, and you return it by signing thanks. Stepping out, you avoid your boyfriend\u2019s gaze. Though, as petty as it may seem, you revel ever so slightly when you notice that from your periphery, he acts upon a tell \u2013 a reflex he always resorts to when he\u2019s jealous. You see his arm reaching out for your waist, but he retracts it in hesitation just as quickly, playing it off as an itch on his arm. <i>Good call, </i>you mentally snicker.</p><p>You glance up at him, neither of you daring to hold eye contact for too long as you nod in greeting. Being stuck with him suddenly fills you with regret that things turned out the way they did. Hands to yourself. Unfamiliar expressions. Unspoken words. Yet, it\u2019s not something you can help, is it? He started it, after all. It\u2019s elementary knowledge that neither of you are enjoying the tension, but it\u2019s also just as easy to tell that it\u2019s a tension that can\u2019t be easily dispelled after the memory of the previous night, a memory that the both of you are pleadingly desperate to push away from your minds.</p><p>He clears his throat and points towards the exit. \u201cShall we\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Looking everywhere but at him, you nod and take the lead. Your heels echo loudly in the hallway, but instead of giving you the confidence you needed, you find yourself straining your calves so that they don\u2019t land as loudly against the floors. Harry trailing right behind you fills you up with a certain pressure to appear more appealing than you felt \u2013 and you felt like utter <i>shit</i> \u2013 and it takes everything in you to refrain from looking down at your heels or crossing your arms in front of you as you walked.</p><p>The walk in the hallway alone felt like the longest exam you\u2019ve ever had to sit for, and you\u2019ve sat through unbearably long exams in the past. Yet, when you\u2019re about to approach his Range Rover (which, although he should seriously consider getting his windows tinted, you think, the Rover is a safe choice), Harry\u2019s hand cups your shoulder to stop you from going any further. You slow your step. Despite your frustrations about the different precautions you have to take when the two of you are in public, you decide to comply yet again this time. </p><p>Instinctively, as with the many times you\u2019ve went out with him in the past, you reach for his hand and stay close behind him as he walks ahead of you, and you shake your head subtly at the way your hand tightens its grip on his large, calloused one when you start hearing cameras clicking around you. Harry has gotten restraining orders against the paparazzi in the past, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from sneaking up on him (and inevitably, you) from a distance. </p><p>Moments like this put your mind into overdrive. Do you dip your head down? Would that make you look guilty? Do you look up, then? You don\u2019t have any makeup on, though.</p><p>Harry senses that you\u2019re unsettled. He glances to you and squeezes your hand, sending a smile your way. \u201cI\u2019m here. It\u2019s alright.\u201d You nod hesitantly, and he looks back ahead, picking up his pace towards the car.</p><p>Is it really okay, though? Ever since a particularly bogus and brutal article was released about you in the past, claiming you were rude to staff members at a bistro because you just happened to be frowning in deep thought at the menu, you picked up a tendency of overanalysing your own movements and gestures. Suddenly, you aren\u2019t all too happy about your decision to wear last night\u2019s dress \u2013 though on second thought, maybe it would\u2019ve been better than if you emerged in Ash\u2019s sweats.</p><p>You scoff at yourself when you realise what you\u2019re doing. <i>Even when you know the truth behind what\u2019s happening here, are you really doubting your own intentions?</i></p><p>The car beeps to life, and the relief that washes over you when you\u2019re finally in arm\u2019s reach of the car would\u2019ve made you laugh any other day. Harry opens the door on the passenger\u2019s side for you, his hand comfortingly reaching for your back, and you climb in with a restrained sigh as he shuts the door. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous how much you hate the familiar pine scent of car\u2019s interior right now. Your eyes follow him through the windshield as he strides briskly to the other side of the car, and by the time he\u2019s in, you\u2019re staring blankly outside, your heart awaiting the plunge of the conversation that\u2019s about to ensue.</p><p>\u201cTake me to a hotel,\u201d you blurt. You see him turn his head slightly, but you can only guess that he\u2019s not reacting much wilder because the two of you are under the scrutiny of the public eye.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>You know you\u2019re presenting him with a challenging dilemma here, but it\u2019s about time your needs are met. You have tried to be understanding of his situation, God<i> knows </i>you\u2019ve tried. You don\u2019t want to be the next one to break his heart or be the one who makes him lose faith in love, but you\u2019re not sure if you can do this anymore. You\u2019re sick of pandering to his needs all the time just because he\u2019s a celebrity. You\u2019re sick of being second to none.</p><p>You hear him get extremely quiet. Not a sign of a sigh nor a breath. The sounds of the stereo and the droning of the car overtake the space. The air is fragile. </p><p>In that moment, the both of you are afraid to move. But out of your better interests, Harry places one hand on the wheel and another on the gear, and you turn off the stereo although it\u2019s halfway through <i>Irreplaceable</i>. You don\u2019t need your heart to break the next time you listen to Beyonc\u00e9. </p><p>He pulls out of the parking spot, and you prepare yourself for the long trip he\u2019ll take to lose the paps\u2019 snooping trail. </p><br/><p>Your arms are crossed, and you\u2019re letting your vision ping-pong among the streetlamps passing down the moderately busy road. It\u2019s taking a lot for you not to cry, so you\u2019ve let a soundless, stray tear fall. Then another, and another, until so many have fallen that you\u2019re numb and you\u2019re seeing the streetlamps again.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening next to you, and it\u2019s not something you think you\u2019d want to know either. </p><p>You\u2019re thankful, but also slightly disappointed, when he follows through with your request. He\u2019s driving you into the indoor parking lot of a very golden hotel you don\u2019t bother to catch the name of. The parking lot is a jarring asphalt grey, lit by yellow lights placed distantly apart from each other. You spot a good number of cars, from brands you\u2019d require a couple years of salary\u2019s worth to afford, taking up spaces.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pay for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d you both tacitly acknowledge the word only when it\u2019s too late, and it stuns you out of any response you could possibly come up with, \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>He continues the drive, finally settling on a parking spot that\u2019s further in and more private. The closer the car comes to a stop, the more anxious you feel yourself becoming. It shows when you begin picking on the hem of your dress. </p><p>The car comes to a slow halt. Neither of you make a move.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>The dreaded words come from Harry\u2019s dry throat. You chuckle dryly, not speaking for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Your statement is suspended, incomplete, and the two of you know it. You\u2019re not really responding to his question more than you\u2019re expressing how overwhelming all this is to you. It feels colder than before, so you raise your shoulders and bring your arms closer to yourself. </p><p>He notices, and turns down the air-conditioning. A heavy, pregnant pause sits like a brick wall between you two.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry.\u201d Your eyes fixate on the glove compartment you\u2019d hit about twelve hours ago, your fingers reach up to fiddle with it in anxiety. \u201cThis is a lot for me,\u201d you shake your head, still refusing to face him.</p><p>If there\u2019s one thing you appreciate about him, it\u2019s that he lets you think. For someone who values being understood, his action is much more precious than it sounds. You know how hard it can be for someone like him, who could possibly be even more misunderstood than you, especially with the spotlight constantly on him and expectations weighing on him all the time.</p><p>But this is about you. So, as your fingers fiddle, you think. You are more than aware of the fact that you are navigating a field of landmines with this conversation.</p><p>\u201cEven as I say that, I don\u2019t think you get the extent of how much this is for me,\u201d you continue, no longer able to visualise how <i>public </i>your relationship is. \u201cThe fact that we are sitting in this closed parking lot to talk\u2026\u201d</p><p>You blink, unable to process what you\u2019re even saying. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even have an argument at Ash\u2019s outdoor parking lot, because this whole thing\u2026 my whole life\u2026 your whole life\u2026 revolves around\u2026\u201d you face him, \u201cyou. Revolves around protecting your image. Your cred, your rep. Everything I do goes back to you. Everything I do has your name on it instead of mine. I\u2019m not Y/N. I\u2019m Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d You remember the conversation you have with Yuan Ling the previous night, and it makes you grimace in exasperation that that is all you amounted to.</p><p>You scoff. \u201cYou know what doesn\u2019t help? When I have victories like that stupid project I\u2019ve been working my ass off for nearly a whole year, and even then, I can\u2019t have my one night of joy, because Harry Styles is working on something on his phone with other people. Harry Styles could be taking a fucking nap and Y/N could be curing cancer, and Harry Styles will still be more important than Y/N.\u201d You straighten your back, and you feel yourself raising your voice. \u201cThat has always been okay because it was public opinion that I couldn\u2019t care less for,\u201d your hands wildly gesture, \u201cbut to be reminded of that, by <i>you</i>? Harry, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Through that, he is biting harder and harder at the inside of his cheek, but you can only focus on trying to hold yourself back from the heaviness in your chest. You wipe the tear that has found its way down your face.</p><p>\u201cYou have the entire world holding you up. Who do I have? I\u2019ve weeded people out of my circle for you. I could\u2019ve been with my small handful of friends, but I chose you. I always choose you when you\u2019re around, when you\u2019re an option, and I will always continue to choose you because you deserve the world. I wouldn\u2019t choose them, wouldn\u2019t choose my phone.\u201d You shrug. Where is the anger when you needed it? \u201cSo, tell me, Harry. Why is it so hard for you to choose <i>me</i>?\u201d your voice cracks at the end, and that\u2019s when you stop trying to hold it together. You unbuckle your seatbelt, and you\u2019re ready to leave just like the last time.</p><p>Only this time, you hear all the doors being locked and his hand on yours. Your head whips to face Harry, and you see his other hand on the master locks on the driver\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019not letting you go. Not again.\u201d An enormous load of regret precipitates its way into you when you take a good look of his countenance for the first time today. His eyebrows are knit, a deepened crease implanting itself onto his forehead. His eyes are a deep contrast of red lines amidst white and against green. There are dark, embossed semicircles under his eyes. His lips are bitten to a furious pink, and they stand out against the faint stubble forming around it. </p><p>You know what he means when he says that, and you don\u2019t pull your hand away from his touch, but you do scowl in spite of his worn-out face. \u201cWhat discovery did you make while I was away? Why do you want me now?\u201d</p><p>He purses his dry lips and lets his head hang, and you wonder how he doesn\u2019t feel the sting from putting them under so much pressure for the past few hours. Even when he wordlessly parts his lips and you can still see the cogs turning in his head, you don\u2019t know if you have the patience to await his response.</p><p>But you wait, knowing that little can emerge out of hostility, and knowing that despite all his talent and skills, openness is one trait he\u2019s learning to pick up again. <i>I don\u2019t want to be the one to reverse that process. </i>Your hand returns to the glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out of the car, shouldn\u2019t have been using my phone on your night\u2026 <i>fuck. </i>I don\u2019t know why I did all that. Wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d He drops his head and brings his hand to his face, his curls lightly springing when he shakes his head. </p><p>His teeth remain on his bottom lip, desperately hoping that with every periodic \u201cfuck\u201d he mutters, the memory that\u2019s weighing him down with so much regret would chop itself out of his mind. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s regretted anything he\u2019s ever done this much. In the past few hours, he had been pacing back and forth, pinching his eyes shut in remorse and sighing in frustration so much that his eyes are sore, and his throat is uncomfortably warm even for someone who sings for a living. He didn\u2019t know how much he lost until he was back in his unnecessarily huge living room, feet gliding on his six-thousand-over dollars carpet, blatantly ignoring his dermatologist\u2019s words when he picks his face that is reflected back to him every time he walks past his career achievements hanging undusted on the tall walls. The only thing his senses pick up amidst all the opulence and admiration he is surrounded by every day, amidst the crowds chanting his name and singing his words back to him, is how deafening the silence is in his own home without you.</p><p>He feels himself panic in fear that his silence is getting a little too long, and that you\u2019re getting a little intolerant of him as he watches the glove compartment open and shut, open and shut, open. Pushing his hair away from his face, he slowly speaks the words he doesn\u2019t want you to misunderstand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m selfish. What I did yesterday, and all those times I was on my phone\u2026\u201d \u2013 he mumbles what you assume is an admonishment to himself \u2013 \u201c\u2026it was all selfish of me. I\u2026 I can\u2019t excuse myself. And if you can\u2019t forgive me I understand because I wouldn\u2019t forgive me either, fuck.\u201d He shakes his head again towards the end of his ramble.</p><p>You swallow, playing with one of his chunky rings you found inside the compartment. He continues. \u201cWhat did I discover last night? Everything that I have, everything that you think I have, everything that I thought I have, is nothing.\u201d Without missing a beat, he stresses it again so hard, that you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t get how empty his nothing is.</p><p>\u201c<i>Nothing</i>. The music, the money, the attention. They could all disappear, and it wouldn\u2019t be half as bad because they only exist as long as Harry Styles exists. But you?\u201d his voice weakens to a high-pitched whisper. In the parking lot of one of the most elite and expensive hotels around, in the car so carefully maintained and running on the best fuel, he is disillusioned.</p><p> \u201cYou are the only person around me who knows me. Knows me for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have your friends\u2026 and Gemma, and your mum\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not you, Y/N.\u201d His hands are shaking yours urgently, and your fingers tighten around his. \u201cYou are who I want to come home to. You are the one I want to share my world with.\u201d</p><p>You feel your tears dripping on your hands as this dilemma rips you apart on the inside. You just want everything to be okay, to get back to normal, to go home and be the music that gives him meaning. </p><p>Instead, you force your words past your yearning for comfort.</p><p>\u201cBut, Harry,\u201d you ask him the one question you don\u2019t want to ask. Not after everything he revealed to you. \u201cWhy were you on your phone?\u201d</p><p>With too much difficulty, you look up into his wide, constricted green eyes, caught off-guard by your question. He whispers.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026 s\u2019working.\u201d</p><p>You nod, finally turning your gaze away. \u201cIt was Harry Styles, the musician, that I was with the past few weeks, then, wasn\u2019t it? You\u2019re working, you\u2019re Harry Styles, even when you\u2019re with me. To everyone else, it\u2019s Harry Styles that I\u2019m with wherever I go, not Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, just\u2026 let me stay. I\u2014\u201d you can see him tearing at his seams, and it makes your heart shatter for the millionth time. You don\u2019t want to be the one to bring him this torture, and the pressure, the guilt, the pain, it\u2019s all building up inside you. \u201cI know I\u2019m a lot to deal with, my personality, my job\u2014 I can\u2019t help it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I can either, Harry!\u201d you burst in exclamation, loudly gasping as you finally give in to the sobs that you\u2019ve been holding back ever since the start of it all. </p><p>Your outburst dispels the tension that has been clouding the dim interior of the car. A quiet, vulnerable symphony ensues, a sob or a particularly sharp gasp emitting from either of you. You hug your knees close to your chest in the shadows, needing warmth and comfort from something, anything. You hate how through all of this, you want to be the one holding him, knowing he truly has it much worse than you do, yet little did you know that he was thinking the same thing as he crosses his arms tightly to himself. It takes a while before your cries become sniffles or the occasional hiccup, and through it all, as much as you felt like leaving, you couldn\u2019t move if he was there with you.</p><p>It\u2019s Harry who speaks up again, his hoarse voice piercing the space. \u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d</p><p>You are terrified of how absolute the question is. So, you stay honest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t know how much more I can hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t want you to be in pain because you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Neither of you speak again for a while. You run your thumb along the ring in your hand. It\u2019s gotten warm from your touch, having played around with it since you found it.</p><p>You hear him humourlessly chuckle next to you. \u201cGot that in Greece, remember?\u201d</p><p>In spite of everything that transpired, the weakest smile perks up the corner of your lip. Greece. Of course, you remember. You\u2019ve always believed it to be the best vacation of your life, because it was with Harry\u2026 just Harry.</p><p>You nod, letting the ring sit on the palm of your hand. Another wave of tears threatens to fall, though this time, they\u2019re sweet, reminiscent ones. You\u2019re reminded of the joys of being with him. Waking up next to him, being the only one to hear his snores in the morning. Your adventures with coffee. The goofy selfies that you keep in your phone and the memories you keep in your heart. The affection he gives to you and no one else, be it through the pet names or the surprise meals or the inside jokes between you two that he peppers in the love songs that never get to see the light of day, the encouraging messages and voice notes he sends you through tough days, the hours he holds you on tougher nights, everything from the small talk to the pillow talk.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, that this is when you feel the \u2018L\u2019 word on your tongue. How can you call it that, though, if you give it all up? Your mind always returns to the question of whether you\u2019re willing to give \u2018Y/N\u2019 up for \u2018Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the world looking in on us is too much for you\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t protected you well from it.\u201d He sighs tiredly. </p><p>\u2026 But hasn\u2019t he given up Harry for Harry Styles as well? All those times that the two of you have gone out together, the cameras capture Harry Styles and Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2026 not Harry and Y/N.</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams, we are one. S\u2019not about me, though. The ball\u2019s in your court.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if what you\u2019re doing is a mistake. Only time will tell.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows are raised in hope that he heard you right. You eye him back timidly, short enough for him to unbuckle his seatbelt and reach for you in the wildest chase he can to hold you in case this was all a dream. Clamouring, he lunges his huge self towards you and buries his head into your neck, now wet with his tears, and you have to withhold your whimper at finally being able to feel him on you. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk conditions.

Not that he isn\u2019t usually kind, but you felt assured that he\u2019s definitely got your back. Not only did he pick you up after you left him some cryptic message; he let you sleep in his bed while he took the couch (which you\u2019d been asking him to replace for a while now), he let you have the last earl grey teabag he had lying around in the kitchen, he let you choose the show you wanted to watch instead of letting him continue his F.R.I.E.N.D.S rerun.

He didn\u2019t care too much for sleeping on his bed, or tea, or TV. He doesn\u2019t care much for Y/N either, really, but having you around was okay. At least he wasn\u2019t alone, and you could be really interesting sometimes. A part of him has some sort of adoration for you ever since you first established yourself to be a brilliant law student to your class and professors, but he\u2019s always seen you as an icky little sister more than anything else.</p><p>As you found yourself waking up in an unfamiliar bedroom, a wave of panic rushed through you until you caught sight of your dress hanging on the hook on the wall and you\u2019re reminded of last night\u2019s disaster. With a frown, a long exhale escapes your nostrils as you let yourself fall back onto\nthe pillows.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to face him, but you don\u2019t want to bother Ash either. You rake your hands through your messed-up hair and tug at your roots. You groan in even greater frustration when you think about having to go home in yesterday\u2019s outfit, and how bad that would look if pictures got out.</p><p>You stop yourself. There it is again. Your life has grown to revolve around his, and if that one thought doesn\u2019t prove it, you don\u2019t know what does. You sigh yet again, but you can\u2019t help that you automatically start desperately wishing that one of the Kardashians did something to throw a blanket over any news that could possibly have be published about your relationship in the last twelve hours.</p><p>For a moment you entertain the thought of going online and\nchecking out if any damage has been done. Somehow, it has never, ever kicked in for you, despite the countless times you\u2019ve done it, that going online when you\u2019re curious only ever leads to a complete plummet in your mood. You don\u2019t even remember how many times it\u2019s been that you\u2019d succumb to your curiosity, go onto Twitter to search up your name alongside Harry\u2019s, and instantly regret it when you make sense of all the hatred you get for being his girlfriend. Everything in you is itching to get online, and despite the protests in your head, you don\u2019t really stop yourself from reaching into your clutch to fish your phone out. You let it power on, and as you\u2019re about to yield to your craving for melodrama, your boyfriend\u2019s texts from last night sliding up and down your status bar stop you.</p><p><b><i>4 missed calls</i></b></p><p><i>[21:02]: I\u2019m so sorry, my love</i></p><p><i>[21:05]: Can we talk about this?</i></p><p><i>[21:24]: Where are you?</i></p><p><i>[22:19]: God, Y/N, please tell me you\u2019re safe.</i></p><p><i>[03:48]: I\u2019m so, so sorry. I love you. I have no right to ask you of this but I know you and I beg you to stay off the web. At least until we work it out.</i></p><p>A twang invades your chest as you register the urgency in his tone, and you feel your face contort into a saddened frown from the dilemma that brews in your entire being after reading his messages. Your despair is immediately replaced with anxiety when you notice three grey dots appear mere seconds after you\u2019ve read your messages.</p><p><i>[08:09]: I\u2019m so sorry.</i></p><p><i>[08:09]: And good morning, love.</i> </p><p>You swallow with difficulty and bite your bottom lip before it can sink any further. Your thumbs hover over the screen. On one hand, you\u2019re dying to let him know you\u2019re okay if it means he wouldn\u2019t worry about you. <i>Did he even sleep at all last night? </i>On the other hand, you selfishly want him to experience the sort of worry that you do for him, and if that means coldly refusing to respond to him, then so be it. </p><p>\u2026 Right?</p><p>You toss your phone back into your clutch before you can go back on your decision. As far as you\u2019re concerned, he is not getting an ounce of satisfaction out of this. It\u2019s unfair enough as it is \u2013 now that you\u2019ve read his texts, you know that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting any peace of mind in the next few hours\u2026 maybe even days.</p><p>The sun\u2019s rays beating the walls of the room ironically darkens your mood further. Of all the things you feel today, cheery is not one of them. Throwing the hoodie Ash lent you over your head and tightening the sweatpants he\u2019d let you borrow, you let the slippers shuffle you out of the bedroom.</p><p>You\u2019ve taken it upon yourself to get a steaming cup\u2019s equivalent of coffee in your veins within the next hour. You take lighter steps when you see your friend\u2019s half-naked body still slackened, loose and drooling in slumber, and a part of you wonders how he\u2019s able to sleep so well on that lumpy, older than Beethoven couch. Shaking your head, you create a mental note to bring him window-shopping for couches one of these days. Maybe even get him a proper couch yourself.</p><p>With the thought lingering in your head among other memories from the previous night, you mindlessly pull the utensils and ingredients for your coffee and brew a jug enough for you and the sleepyhead on the other side of the apartment, not realising until later when Ash mumbled something about the coffee being thick that you had brewed it the way you and Harry grew to love your morning cuppa.</p><br><p>In the living room, you\u2019re cross-legged on the couch with Ash\u2019s laptop resting on your legs. You\u2019ve got your inbox open and you\u2019re\nsifting through your emails \u2013 yet, for someone who goes through emails like it\u2019s second nature, you were going through them at a suspiciously slow pace. Your glassy eyes staring at the corner of the laptop, you don\u2019t realise it, but your thoughts are still stuck in the darkness of yesterday.</p><p>Ash emerges from his bedroom carrying a gym bag. When he\ncatches your distracted statue on his couch, he detours to the kitchen instead of letting himself be seen as he wonders if he should ask you about it or simply flick your attention away from your thoughts. Grabbing a banana from the counter, he sighs as he watches the back of your head staring down at the stagnant screen, and he walks towards the entrance while clearing his throat. His little cough draws you away from your screen, and you look up to him with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019going to the gym for a while. Will you be fine on your own?\u201d he dips his head slightly, and you find his concerned hazel eyes examining yours. You acknowledge the flurry of things zooming through your head at his question \u2013 <i>On my own? I\u2019m not even fine with you here. But I can\u2019t possibly stop you from going, what good will that do? Y/N, just give him the easy answer \u2013 </i>and you\u2019re about to nod.</p><p>The ding of the doorbell brings both of your gazes to the door. A confused expression takes over your features as you turn back to him, but the single eyebrow he raises seems to prove that he\u2019s just as unsure as you are, and you\u2019re left to imagine it\u2019s a door-to-door salesman or a couple of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses preaching their Lord\u2019s word with every door that is opened.</p><p>You return to your emails with the intrusive thoughts invading your focus less this time, and this time you even manage to rapidly click away at the keyboard as you type a sentence in.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You look up again at Ash, who\u2019s leaning against the door and has his back turned towards you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry.\u201d</p><p>The two words are enough to make your head whirl and your breath shallow, and you have to lean back and clutch tightly to the fabric of your seat to stabilise yourself. Wild eyed, you shake your head at Ash and you begin to get up as you feel a cry slowly rising up your throat, carrying the laptop with you. You see him opening the door by a crack and you hear a muffled exchange, but you pull the bedroom door quietly shut before you can hear or see the one who brought you so much anger and hurt in the past 12 hours. </p><p><i>What the hell does he want? Why does he think it\u2019s okay to drag his ass all the way here? </i>Your feet, for whatever reason, bring you to the mirror on the wall, and your scowl only deepens when you see how horrid you look. Is this how you looked like last night, when you slammed the door in his face?</p><p>You can feel your jaw beginning to tremble and a ghost of a sob lurking in the back of your throat, but sucking in a cool, deep breath through your parted lips, you flip your feelings before they can manifest in another wet fit. Instead, you tighten your hands into fists, revelling in the way angry, red semicircles form on the palms of your hand.</p><p>You\u2019re trying hard not to leave a scene for Ash to clean up after, but you can\u2019t help that you\u2019re yanking your phone from the charger as you think about how your life revolves around your boyfriend and how entitled he thinks he is, showing up at your best friend\u2019s house when you\u2019re trying to give him a taste of his own medicine with your absence. That\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t feel the tinge of pride and security, of course, that he\u2019s begging for you at the door right now. You kick your slippers off, aligning them one atop the other. </p><br><p>The breath Harry had been holding comes out in a disappointed sigh when Ash opens the door instead of you. \u201cHey, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sup.\u201d Ash raises his eyebrows at the absurdity and irony of his own response. Despite your name being the tacit tension that makes the air thick between the two men, Ash doesn\u2019t succumb to his usual carefree self by inviting Harry in. Instead, the gap of the door remains small, and he finds himself straightening his back when he notices the unwelcome visitor straining his neck to search inside the apartment. Harry catches his gesture, reverting his piercing gaze to the man blocking his view and feeling the pride build up in his chest when he averts his sight quickly with a swallow.</p><p>\u201cLook, mate,\u201d Ash speaks up first, and he tries to keep his voice low since he knows you\u2019re in enough distress as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get in the middle of any of this, yeah? But she seems pissed with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know\u2014just\u2026\u201d he exhales, head hanging low and hands on his hips. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Ash observes the darkened bags under his bloodshot eyes, and\nhow he\u2019s just a little less unkempt than he normally is: the dress shirt he has on is crumpled and the cuffs aren\u2019t buttoned, his hair doesn\u2019t have the same neat messiness that\u2019s typical of him. \u201cS\u2019not for me to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I speak to her?\u201d he seizes the opportunity the\nmoment he hears the response, snapping up with hopeful eyes. Selfishly, he wishes that this is the one time his supposed universal charm works on his girlfriend\u2019s best friend, but when he sees him puffing his chest out a little, he knows it doesn\u2019t really work to his favour this time.</p><p>Ash doesn\u2019t expect that he has a protective streak for you, and he\u2019s certain he doesn\u2019t \u2013 yet he allows himself a small dig since you aren\u2019t around to reprimand him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen to her wishes, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, <i>bud</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him, Ash.\u201d</p><p>Both pair of eyes dart towards the sound of your voice, where you are strutting up to the door with an eye-roll and with your belongings bundled up in your hands. You\u2019ve changed back into your dress from the previous night, knowing full well there will be lenses outside ready to twist and publish the story into more than it actually is \u2013 just as you intend it to be, especially after the emotional hell you\u2019ve been put through by the wide-eyed moron on the other side of the door.</p><p>You bring a hand up to your friend\u2019s arm, sending him the most genuine half-smile you can muster, and you speak \u2013 despite the look of concern he gives you, and despite Harry listening. \u201cThanks for having my back, don\u2019t wanna keep bothering you. I owe you one, yeah? I left your clothes in the\nlaundry bag,\u201d you proceed forward, but halt as an afterthought pops into your head, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll get you more teabags next time, and we <i>will</i> find you a better couch, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d he simply replies, and he taps at his forehead four times, <i>I\u2019ll be right here.</i> A tiny exhale of a laugh escapes your lips at the understanding of your E.T. inside joke being communicated to you, and you return it by signing thanks. Stepping out, you avoid your boyfriend\u2019s gaze. Though, as petty as it may seem, you revel ever so slightly when you notice that from your periphery, he acts upon a tell \u2013 a reflex he always resorts to when he\u2019s jealous. You see his arm reaching out for your waist, but he retracts it in hesitation just as quickly, playing it off as an itch on his arm. <i>Good call, </i>you mentally snicker.</p><p>You glance up at him, neither of you daring to hold eye contact for too long as you nod in greeting. Being stuck with him suddenly fills you with regret that things turned out the way they did. Hands to yourself. Unfamiliar expressions. Unspoken words. Yet, it\u2019s not something you can help, is it? He started it, after all. It\u2019s elementary knowledge that neither of you are enjoying the tension, but it\u2019s also just as easy to tell that it\u2019s a tension that can\u2019t be easily dispelled after the memory of the previous night, a memory that the both of you are pleadingly desperate to push away from your minds.</p><p>He clears his throat and points towards the exit. \u201cShall we\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Looking everywhere but at him, you nod and take the lead. Your heels echo loudly in the hallway, but instead of giving you the confidence you needed, you find yourself straining your calves so that they don\u2019t land as loudly against the floors. Harry trailing right behind you fills you up with a certain pressure to appear more appealing than you felt \u2013 and you felt like utter <i>shit</i> \u2013 and it takes everything in you to refrain from looking down at your heels or crossing your arms in front of you as you walked.</p><p>The walk in the hallway alone felt like the longest exam you\u2019ve ever had to sit for, and you\u2019ve sat through unbearably long exams in the past. Yet, when you\u2019re about to approach his Range Rover (which, although he should seriously consider getting his windows tinted, you think, the Rover is a safe choice), Harry\u2019s hand cups your shoulder to stop you from going any further. You slow your step. Despite your frustrations about the different precautions you have to take when the two of you are in public, you decide to comply yet again this time. </p><p>Instinctively, as with the many times you\u2019ve went out with him in the past, you reach for his hand and stay close behind him as he walks ahead of you, and you shake your head subtly at the way your hand tightens its grip on his large, calloused one when you start hearing cameras clicking around you. Harry has gotten restraining orders against the paparazzi in the past, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from sneaking up on him (and inevitably, you) from a distance. </p><p>Moments like this put your mind into overdrive. Do you dip your head down? Would that make you look guilty? Do you look up, then? You don\u2019t have any makeup on, though.</p><p>Harry senses that you\u2019re unsettled. He glances to you and squeezes your hand, sending a smile your way. \u201cI\u2019m here. It\u2019s alright.\u201d You nod hesitantly, and he looks back ahead, picking up his pace towards the car.</p><p>Is it really okay, though? Ever since a particularly bogus and brutal article was released about you in the past, claiming you were rude to staff members at a bistro because you just happened to be frowning in deep thought at the menu, you picked up a tendency of overanalysing your own movements and gestures. Suddenly, you aren\u2019t all too happy about your decision to wear last night\u2019s dress \u2013 though on second thought, maybe it would\u2019ve been better than if you emerged in Ash\u2019s sweats.</p><p>You scoff at yourself when you realise what you\u2019re doing. <i>Even when you know the truth behind what\u2019s happening here, are you really doubting your own intentions?</i></p><p>The car beeps to life, and the relief that washes over you when you\u2019re finally in arm\u2019s reach of the car would\u2019ve made you laugh any other day. Harry opens the door on the passenger\u2019s side for you, his hand comfortingly reaching for your back, and you climb in with a restrained sigh as he shuts the door. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous how much you hate the familiar pine scent of car\u2019s interior right now. Your eyes follow him through the windshield as he strides briskly to the other side of the car, and by the time he\u2019s in, you\u2019re staring blankly outside, your heart awaiting the plunge of the conversation that\u2019s about to ensue.</p><p>\u201cTake me to a hotel,\u201d you blurt. You see him turn his head slightly, but you can only guess that he\u2019s not reacting much wilder because the two of you are under the scrutiny of the public eye.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>You know you\u2019re presenting him with a challenging dilemma here, but it\u2019s about time your needs are met. You have tried to be understanding of his situation, God<i> knows </i>you\u2019ve tried. You don\u2019t want to be the next one to break his heart or be the one who makes him lose faith in love, but you\u2019re not sure if you can do this anymore. You\u2019re sick of pandering to his needs all the time just because he\u2019s a celebrity. You\u2019re sick of being second to none.</p><p>You hear him get extremely quiet. Not a sign of a sigh nor a breath. The sounds of the stereo and the droning of the car overtake the space. The air is fragile. </p><p>In that moment, the both of you are afraid to move. But out of your better interests, Harry places one hand on the wheel and another on the gear, and you turn off the stereo although it\u2019s halfway through <i>Irreplaceable</i>. You don\u2019t need your heart to break the next time you listen to Beyonc\u00e9. </p><p>He pulls out of the parking spot, and you prepare yourself for the long trip he\u2019ll take to lose the paps\u2019 snooping trail. </p><br><p>Your arms are crossed, and you\u2019re letting your vision ping-pong among the streetlamps passing down the moderately busy road. It\u2019s taking a lot for you not to cry, so you\u2019ve let a soundless, stray tear fall. Then another, and another, until so many have fallen that you\u2019re numb and you\u2019re seeing the streetlamps again.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening next to you, and it\u2019s not something you think you\u2019d want to know either. </p><p>You\u2019re thankful, but also slightly disappointed, when he follows through with your request. He\u2019s driving you into the indoor parking lot of a very golden hotel you don\u2019t bother to catch the name of. The parking lot is a jarring asphalt grey, lit by yellow lights placed distantly apart from each other. You spot a good number of cars, from brands you\u2019d require a couple years of salary\u2019s worth to afford, taking up spaces.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pay for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d you both tacitly acknowledge the word only when it\u2019s too late, and it stuns you out of any response you could possibly come up with, \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>He continues the drive, finally settling on a parking spot that\u2019s further in and more private. The closer the car comes to a stop, the more anxious you feel yourself becoming. It shows when you begin picking on the hem of your dress. </p><p>The car comes to a slow halt. Neither of you make a move.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>The dreaded words come from Harry\u2019s dry throat. You chuckle dryly, not speaking for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Your statement is suspended, incomplete, and the two of you know it. You\u2019re not really responding to his question more than you\u2019re expressing how overwhelming all this is to you. It feels colder than before, so you raise your shoulders and bring your arms closer to yourself. </p><p>He notices, and turns down the air-conditioning. A heavy, pregnant pause sits like a brick wall between you two.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry.\u201d Your eyes fixate on the glove compartment you\u2019d hit about twelve hours ago, your fingers reach up to fiddle with it in anxiety. \u201cThis is a lot for me,\u201d you shake your head, still refusing to face him.</p><p>If there\u2019s one thing you appreciate about him, it\u2019s that he lets you think. For someone who values being understood, his action is much more precious than it sounds. You know how hard it can be for someone like him, who could possibly be even more misunderstood than you, especially with the spotlight constantly on him and expectations weighing on him all the time.</p><p>But this is about you. So, as your fingers fiddle, you think. You are more than aware of the fact that you are navigating a field of landmines with this conversation.</p><p>\u201cEven as I say that, I don\u2019t think you get the extent of how much this is for me,\u201d you continue, no longer able to visualise how <i>public </i>your relationship is. \u201cThe fact that we are sitting in this closed parking lot to talk\u2026\u201d</p><p>You blink, unable to process what you\u2019re even saying. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even have an argument at Ash\u2019s outdoor parking lot, because this whole thing\u2026 my whole life\u2026 your whole life\u2026 revolves around\u2026\u201d you face him, \u201cyou. Revolves around protecting your image. Your cred, your rep. Everything I do goes back to you. Everything I do has your name on it instead of mine. I\u2019m not Y/N. I\u2019m Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d You remember the conversation you have with Yuan Ling the previous night, and it makes you grimace in exasperation that that is all you amounted to.</p><p>You scoff. \u201cYou know what doesn\u2019t help? When I have victories like that stupid project I\u2019ve been working my ass off for nearly a whole year, and even then, I can\u2019t have my one night of joy, because Harry Styles is working on something on his phone with other people. Harry Styles could be taking a fucking nap and Y/N could be curing cancer, and Harry Styles will still be more important than Y/N.\u201d You straighten your back, and you feel yourself raising your voice. \u201cThat has always been okay because it was public opinion that I couldn\u2019t care less for,\u201d your hands wildly gesture, \u201cbut to be reminded of that, by <i>you</i>? Harry, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Through that, he is biting harder and harder at the inside of his cheek, but you can only focus on trying to hold yourself back from the heaviness in your chest. You wipe the tear that has found its way down your face.</p><p>\u201cYou have the entire world holding you up. Who do I have? I\u2019ve weeded people out of my circle for you. I could\u2019ve been with my small handful of friends, but I chose you. I always choose you when you\u2019re around, when you\u2019re an option, and I will always continue to choose you because you deserve the world. I wouldn\u2019t choose them, wouldn\u2019t choose my phone.\u201d You shrug. Where is the anger when you needed it? \u201cSo, tell me, Harry. Why is it so hard for you to choose <i>me</i>?\u201d your voice cracks at the end, and that\u2019s when you stop trying to hold it together. You unbuckle your seatbelt, and you\u2019re ready to leave just like the last time.</p><p>Only this time, you hear all the doors being locked and his hand on yours. Your head whips to face Harry, and you see his other hand on the master locks on the driver\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019not letting you go. Not again.\u201d An enormous load of regret precipitates its way into you when you take a good look of his countenance for the first time today. His eyebrows are knit, a deepened crease implanting itself onto his forehead. His eyes are a deep contrast of red lines amidst white and against green. There are dark, embossed semicircles under his eyes. His lips are bitten to a furious pink, and they stand out against the faint stubble forming around it. </p><p>You know what he means when he says that, and you don\u2019t pull your hand away from his touch, but you do scowl in spite of his worn-out face. \u201cWhat discovery did you make while I was away? Why do you want me now?\u201d</p><p>He purses his dry lips and lets his head hang, and you wonder how he doesn\u2019t feel the sting from putting them under so much pressure for the past few hours. Even when he wordlessly parts his lips and you can still see the cogs turning in his head, you don\u2019t know if you have the patience to await his response.</p><p>But you wait, knowing that little can emerge out of hostility, and knowing that despite all his talent and skills, openness is one trait he\u2019s learning to pick up again. <i>I don\u2019t want to be the one to reverse that process. </i>Your hand returns to the glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out of the car, shouldn\u2019t have been using my phone on your night\u2026 <i>fuck. </i>I don\u2019t know why I did all that. Wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d He drops his head and brings his hand to his face, his curls lightly springing when he shakes his head. </p><p>His teeth remain on his bottom lip, desperately hoping that with every periodic \u201cfuck\u201d he mutters, the memory that\u2019s weighing him down with so much regret would chop itself out of his mind. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s regretted anything he\u2019s ever done this much. In the past few hours, he had been pacing back and forth, pinching his eyes shut in remorse and sighing in frustration so much that his eyes are sore, and his throat is uncomfortably warm even for someone who sings for a living. He didn\u2019t know how much he lost until he was back in his unnecessarily huge living room, feet gliding on his six-thousand-over dollars carpet, blatantly ignoring his dermatologist\u2019s words when he picks his face that is reflected back to him every time he walks past his career achievements hanging undusted on the tall walls. The only thing his senses pick up amidst all the opulence and admiration he is surrounded by every day, amidst the crowds chanting his name and singing his words back to him, is how deafening the silence is in his own home without you.</p><p>He feels himself panic in fear that his silence is getting a little too long, and that you\u2019re getting a little intolerant of him as he watches the glove compartment open and shut, open and shut, open. Pushing his hair away from his face, he slowly speaks the words he doesn\u2019t want you to misunderstand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m selfish. What I did yesterday, and all those times I was on my phone\u2026\u201d \u2013 he mumbles what you assume is an admonishment to himself \u2013 \u201c\u2026it was all selfish of me. I\u2026 I can\u2019t excuse myself. And if you can\u2019t forgive me I understand because I wouldn\u2019t forgive me either, fuck.\u201d He shakes his head again towards the end of his ramble.</p><p>You swallow, playing with one of his chunky rings you found inside the compartment. He continues. \u201cWhat did I discover last night? Everything that I have, everything that you think I have, everything that I thought I have, is nothing.\u201d Without missing a beat, he stresses it again so hard, that you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t get how empty his nothing is.</p><p>\u201c<i>Nothing</i>. The music, the money, the attention. They could all disappear, and it wouldn\u2019t be half as bad because they only exist as long as Harry Styles exists. But you?\u201d his voice weakens to a high-pitched whisper. In the parking lot of one of the most elite and expensive hotels around, in the car so carefully maintained and running on the best fuel, he is disillusioned.</p><p> \u201cYou are the only person around me who knows me. Knows me for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have your friends\u2026 and Gemma, and your mum\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not you, Y/N.\u201d His hands are shaking yours urgently, and your fingers tighten around his. \u201cYou are who I want to come home to. You are the one I want to share my world with.\u201d</p><p>You feel your tears dripping on your hands as this dilemma rips you apart on the inside. You just want everything to be okay, to get back to normal, to go home and be the music that gives him meaning. </p><p>Instead, you force your words past your yearning for comfort.</p><p>\u201cBut, Harry,\u201d you ask him the one question you don\u2019t want to ask. Not after everything he revealed to you. \u201cWhy were you on your phone?\u201d</p><p>With too much difficulty, you look up into his wide, constricted green eyes, caught off-guard by your question. He whispers.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026 s\u2019working.\u201d</p><p>You nod, finally turning your gaze away. \u201cIt was Harry Styles, the musician, that I was with the past few weeks, then, wasn\u2019t it? You\u2019re working, you\u2019re Harry Styles, even when you\u2019re with me. To everyone else, it\u2019s Harry Styles that I\u2019m with wherever I go, not Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, just\u2026 let me stay. I\u2014\u201d you can see him tearing at his seams, and it makes your heart shatter for the millionth time. You don\u2019t want to be the one to bring him this torture, and the pressure, the guilt, the pain, it\u2019s all building up inside you. \u201cI know I\u2019m a lot to deal with, my personality, my job\u2014 I can\u2019t help it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I can either, Harry!\u201d you burst in exclamation, loudly gasping as you finally give in to the sobs that you\u2019ve been holding back ever since the start of it all. </p><p>Your outburst dispels the tension that has been clouding the dim interior of the car. A quiet, vulnerable symphony ensues, a sob or a particularly sharp gasp emitting from either of you. You hug your knees close to your chest in the shadows, needing warmth and comfort from something, anything. You hate how through all of this, you want to be the one holding him, knowing he truly has it much worse than you do, yet little did you know that he was thinking the same thing as he crosses his arms tightly to himself. It takes a while before your cries become sniffles or the occasional hiccup, and through it all, as much as you felt like leaving, you couldn\u2019t move if he was there with you.</p><p>It\u2019s Harry who speaks up again, his hoarse voice piercing the space. \u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d</p><p>You are terrified of how absolute the question is. So, you stay honest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t know how much more I can hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t want you to be in pain because you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Neither of you speak again for a while. You run your thumb along the ring in your hand. It\u2019s gotten warm from your touch, having played around with it since you found it.</p><p>You hear him humourlessly chuckle next to you. \u201cGot that in Greece, remember?\u201d</p><p>In spite of everything that transpired, the weakest smile perks up the corner of your lip. Greece. Of course, you remember. You\u2019ve always believed it to be the best vacation of your life, because it was with Harry\u2026 just Harry.</p><p>You nod, letting the ring sit on the palm of your hand. Another wave of tears threatens to fall, though this time, they\u2019re sweet, reminiscent ones. You\u2019re reminded of the joys of being with him. Waking up next to him, being the only one to hear his snores in the morning. Your adventures with coffee. The goofy selfies that you keep in your phone and the memories you keep in your heart. The affection he gives to you and no one else, be it through the pet names or the surprise meals or the inside jokes between you two that he peppers in the love songs that never get to see the light of day, the encouraging messages and voice notes he sends you through tough days, the hours he holds you on tougher nights, everything from the small talk to the pillow talk.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, that this is when you feel the \u2018L\u2019 word on your tongue. How can you call it that, though, if you give it all up? Your mind always returns to the question of whether you\u2019re willing to give \u2018Y/N\u2019 up for \u2018Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the world looking in on us is too much for you\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t protected you well from it.\u201d He sighs tiredly. </p><p>\u2026 But hasn\u2019t he given up Harry for Harry Styles as well? All those times that the two of you have gone out together, the cameras capture Harry Styles and Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2026 not Harry and Y/N.</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams, we are one. S\u2019not about me, though. The ball\u2019s in your court.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if what you\u2019re doing is a mistake. Only time will tell.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows are raised in hope that he heard you right. You eye him back timidly, short enough for him to unbuckle his seatbelt and reach for you in the wildest chase he can to hold you in case this was all a dream. Clamouring, he lunges his huge self towards you and buries his head into your neck, now wet with his tears, and you have to withhold your whimper at finally being able to feel him on you. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk conditions. Rules. Guidelines, Harry, you hear?\u201d you croak as you stretch towards him to hold him close to you.</p><p>\u201cAnything for my Y/N.\u201d He presses kisses up your neck and jaw, emitting a relieved laugh from you. \u201cHarry\u2019s Y/N.\u201d You almost sob again as he presses his lips onto yours, bringing his hand up to your jaw and you kiss him back. The both of you part unwillingly, but breathless, and not letting your sight leave his green eyes that are transfixed with yours.</p><p>You speak, just above a whisper. \u201cYou need to stop biting your lips.\u201d He smirks humorously and rolls his eyes, earning a giggle from you that sends a small, loving grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work this out, I promise.\u201d </p><hr><p>let me know what you think <a href=\"http://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>! read the author\u2019s note <a href=\"https://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/post/178692469101/authors-note-to-call-me-when-youre-done-pt-3\">here</a>!</p><p>taglist (i\u2019m quite sure i\u2019m missing a few names out!): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qcrVNJ3v2TGbs00AQOE7A\">@mywastedtimes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\">@whereishisgrammy</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84KC_UFlzs4Ex4YPfN8eEA\">@emmamonson21</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLTjhAU6NUYX5SqUBAwjJrQ\">@pinkliquorstyles</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDuwCgfmaneuWzUMVoH1w8w\">@im-cool-ask-my-mom</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFOMBVJSWULVv5Y-BoER_TA\">@meetmeinthehallwaydotmp3</a></p>",

Not that he isn\u2019t usually kind, but you felt assured that he\u2019s definitely got your back. Not only did he pick you up after you left him some cryptic message; he let you sleep in his bed while he took the couch (which you\u2019d been asking him to replace for a while now), he let you have the last earl grey teabag he had lying around in the kitchen, he let you choose the show you wanted to watch instead of letting him continue his F.R.I.E.N.D.S rerun. Hell, he even let you vent about the whole situation without interruption, even when you didn\u2019t understand yourself half the time from all the unfiltered thoughts shooting out in between sentences.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Ash himself? He didn\u2019t care too much for sleeping on his bed, or tea, or TV. He doesn\u2019t care much for Y/N either, really, but having you around was okay. At least he wasn\u2019t alone, and you could be really interesting sometimes. A part of him has some sort of adoration for you ever since you first established yourself to be a brilliant law student to your class and professors, but he\u2019s always seen you as an icky little sister more than anything else.</p><p>As you found yourself waking up in an unfamiliar bedroom, a wave of panic rushed through you until you caught sight of your dress hanging on the hook on the wall and you\u2019re reminded of last night\u2019s disaster. With a frown, a long exhale escapes your nostrils as you let yourself fall back onto\nthe pillows.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to face him, but you don\u2019t want to bother Ash either. You rake your hands through your messed-up hair and tug at your roots. You groan in even greater frustration when you think about having to go home in yesterday\u2019s outfit, and how bad that would look if pictures got out.</p><p>You stop yourself. There it is again. Your life has grown to revolve around his, and if that one thought doesn\u2019t prove it, you don\u2019t know what does. You sigh yet again, but you can\u2019t help that you automatically start desperately wishing that one of the Kardashians did something to throw a blanket over any news that could possibly have be published about your relationship in the last twelve hours.</p><p>For a moment you entertain the thought of going online and\nchecking out if any damage has been done. Somehow, it has never, ever kicked in for you, despite the countless times you\u2019ve done it, that going online when you\u2019re curious only ever leads to a complete plummet in your mood. You don\u2019t even remember how many times it\u2019s been that you\u2019d succumb to your curiosity, go onto Twitter to search up your name alongside Harry\u2019s, and instantly regret it when you make sense of all the hatred you get for being his girlfriend. Everything in you is itching to get online, and despite the protests in your head, you don\u2019t really stop yourself from reaching into your clutch to fish your phone out. You let it power on, and as you\u2019re about to yield to your craving for melodrama, your boyfriend\u2019s texts from last night sliding up and down your status bar stop you.</p><p><b><i>4 missed calls</i></b></p><p><i>[21:02]: I\u2019m so sorry, my love</i></p><p><i>[21:05]: Can we talk about this?</i></p><p><i>[21:24]: Where are you?</i></p><p><i>[22:19]: God, Y/N, please tell me you\u2019re safe.</i></p><p><i>[03:48]: I\u2019m so, so sorry. I love you. I have no right to ask you of this but I know you and I beg you to stay off the web. At least until we work it out.</i></p><p>A twang invades your chest as you register the urgency in his tone, and you feel your face contort into a saddened frown from the dilemma that brews in your entire being after reading his messages. Your despair is immediately replaced with anxiety when you notice three grey dots appear mere seconds after you\u2019ve read your messages.</p><p><i>[08:09]: I\u2019m so sorry.</i></p><p><i>[08:09]: And good morning, love.</i> </p><p>You swallow with difficulty and bite your bottom lip before it can sink any further. Your thumbs hover over the screen. On one hand, you\u2019re dying to let him know you\u2019re okay if it means he wouldn\u2019t worry about you. <i>Did he even sleep at all last night? </i>On the other hand, you selfishly want him to experience the sort of worry that you do for him, and if that means coldly refusing to respond to him, then so be it. </p><p>\u2026 Right?</p><p>You toss your phone back into your clutch before you can go back on your decision. As far as you\u2019re concerned, he is not getting an ounce of satisfaction out of this. It\u2019s unfair enough as it is \u2013 now that you\u2019ve read his texts, you know that there\u2019s no way you\u2019re getting any peace of mind in the next few hours\u2026 maybe even days.</p><p>The sun\u2019s rays beating the walls of the room ironically darkens your mood further. Of all the things you feel today, cheery is not one of them. Throwing the hoodie Ash lent you over your head and tightening the sweatpants he\u2019d let you borrow, you let the slippers shuffle you out of the bedroom.</p><p>You\u2019ve taken it upon yourself to get a steaming cup\u2019s equivalent of coffee in your veins within the next hour. You take lighter steps when you see your friend\u2019s half-naked body still slackened, loose and drooling in slumber, and a part of you wonders how he\u2019s able to sleep so well on that lumpy, older than Beethoven couch. Shaking your head, you create a mental note to bring him window-shopping for couches one of these days. Maybe even get him a proper couch yourself.</p><p>With the thought lingering in your head among other memories from the previous night, you mindlessly pull the utensils and ingredients for your coffee and brew a jug enough for you and the sleepyhead on the other side of the apartment, not realising until later when Ash mumbled something about the coffee being thick that you had brewed it the way you and Harry grew to love your morning cuppa.</p><br><p>In the living room, you\u2019re cross-legged on the couch with Ash\u2019s laptop resting on your legs. You\u2019ve got your inbox open and you\u2019re\nsifting through your emails \u2013 yet, for someone who goes through emails like it\u2019s second nature, you were going through them at a suspiciously slow pace. Your glassy eyes staring at the corner of the laptop, you don\u2019t realise it, but your thoughts are still stuck in the darkness of yesterday.</p><p>Ash emerges from his bedroom carrying a gym bag. When he\ncatches your distracted statue on his couch, he detours to the kitchen instead of letting himself be seen as he wonders if he should ask you about it or simply flick your attention away from your thoughts. Grabbing a banana from the counter, he sighs as he watches the back of your head staring down at the stagnant screen, and he walks towards the entrance while clearing his throat. His little cough draws you away from your screen, and you look up to him with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019going to the gym for a while. Will you be fine on your own?\u201d he dips his head slightly, and you find his concerned hazel eyes examining yours. You acknowledge the flurry of things zooming through your head at his question \u2013 <i>On my own? I\u2019m not even fine with you here. But I can\u2019t possibly stop you from going, what good will that do? Y/N, just give him the easy answer \u2013 </i>and you\u2019re about to nod.</p><p>The ding of the doorbell brings both of your gazes to the door. A confused expression takes over your features as you turn back to him, but the single eyebrow he raises seems to prove that he\u2019s just as unsure as you are, and you\u2019re left to imagine it\u2019s a door-to-door salesman or a couple of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses preaching their Lord\u2019s word with every door that is opened.</p><p>You return to your emails with the intrusive thoughts invading your focus less this time, and this time you even manage to rapidly click away at the keyboard as you type a sentence in.</p><p>\u201cY/N.\u201d</p><p>You look up again at Ash, who\u2019s leaning against the door and has his back turned towards you.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harry.\u201d</p><p>The two words are enough to make your head whirl and your breath shallow, and you have to lean back and clutch tightly to the fabric of your seat to stabilise yourself. Wild eyed, you shake your head at Ash and you begin to get up as you feel a cry slowly rising up your throat, carrying the laptop with you. You see him opening the door by a crack and you hear a muffled exchange, but you pull the bedroom door quietly shut before you can hear or see the one who brought you so much anger and hurt in the past 12 hours. </p><p><i>What the hell does he want? Why does he think it\u2019s okay to drag his ass all the way here? </i>Your feet, for whatever reason, bring you to the mirror on the wall, and your scowl only deepens when you see how horrid you look. Is this how you looked like last night, when you slammed the door in his face?</p><p>You can feel your jaw beginning to tremble and a ghost of a sob lurking in the back of your throat, but sucking in a cool, deep breath through your parted lips, you flip your feelings before they can manifest in another wet fit. Instead, you tighten your hands into fists, revelling in the way angry, red semicircles form on the palms of your hand.</p><p>You\u2019re trying hard not to leave a scene for Ash to clean up after, but you can\u2019t help that you\u2019re yanking your phone from the charger as you think about how your life revolves around your boyfriend and how entitled he thinks he is, showing up at your best friend\u2019s house when you\u2019re trying to give him a taste of his own medicine with your absence. That\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t feel the tinge of pride and security, of course, that he\u2019s begging for you at the door right now. You kick your slippers off, aligning them one atop the other. </p><br><p>The breath Harry had been holding comes out in a disappointed sigh when Ash opens the door instead of you. \u201cHey, uh\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Sup.\u201d Ash raises his eyebrows at the absurdity and irony of his own response. Despite your name being the tacit tension that makes the air thick between the two men, Ash doesn\u2019t succumb to his usual carefree self by inviting Harry in. Instead, the gap of the door remains small, and he finds himself straightening his back when he notices the unwelcome visitor straining his neck to search inside the apartment. Harry catches his gesture, reverting his piercing gaze to the man blocking his view and feeling the pride build up in his chest when he averts his sight quickly with a swallow.</p><p>\u201cLook, mate,\u201d Ash speaks up first, and he tries to keep his voice low since he knows you\u2019re in enough distress as it is. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get in the middle of any of this, yeah? But she seems pissed with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know\u2014just\u2026\u201d he exhales, head hanging low and hands on his hips. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Ash observes the darkened bags under his bloodshot eyes, and\nhow he\u2019s just a little less unkempt than he normally is: the dress shirt he has on is crumpled and the cuffs aren\u2019t buttoned, his hair doesn\u2019t have the same neat messiness that\u2019s typical of him. \u201cS\u2019not for me to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I speak to her?\u201d he seizes the opportunity the\nmoment he hears the response, snapping up with hopeful eyes. Selfishly, he wishes that this is the one time his supposed universal charm works on his girlfriend\u2019s best friend, but when he sees him puffing his chest out a little, he knows it doesn\u2019t really work to his favour this time.</p><p>Ash doesn\u2019t expect that he has a protective streak for you, and he\u2019s certain he doesn\u2019t \u2013 yet he allows himself a small dig since you aren\u2019t around to reprimand him. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019d listen to her wishes, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, <i>bud</i>.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him, Ash.\u201d</p><p>Both pair of eyes dart towards the sound of your voice, where you are strutting up to the door with an eye-roll and with your belongings bundled up in your hands. You\u2019ve changed back into your dress from the previous night, knowing full well there will be lenses outside ready to twist and publish the story into more than it actually is \u2013 just as you intend it to be, especially after the emotional hell you\u2019ve been put through by the wide-eyed moron on the other side of the door.</p><p>You bring a hand up to your friend\u2019s arm, sending him the most genuine half-smile you can muster, and you speak \u2013 despite the look of concern he gives you, and despite Harry listening. \u201cThanks for having my back, don\u2019t wanna keep bothering you. I owe you one, yeah? I left your clothes in the\nlaundry bag,\u201d you proceed forward, but halt as an afterthought pops into your head, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll get you more teabags next time, and we <i>will</i> find you a better couch, whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d he simply replies, and he taps at his forehead four times, <i>I\u2019ll be right here.</i> A tiny exhale of a laugh escapes your lips at the understanding of your E.T. inside joke being communicated to you, and you return it by signing thanks. Stepping out, you avoid your boyfriend\u2019s gaze. Though, as petty as it may seem, you revel ever so slightly when you notice that from your periphery, he acts upon a tell \u2013 a reflex he always resorts to when he\u2019s jealous. You see his arm reaching out for your waist, but he retracts it in hesitation just as quickly, playing it off as an itch on his arm. <i>Good call, </i>you mentally snicker.</p><p>You glance up at him, neither of you daring to hold eye contact for too long as you nod in greeting. Being stuck with him suddenly fills you with regret that things turned out the way they did. Hands to yourself. Unfamiliar expressions. Unspoken words. Yet, it\u2019s not something you can help, is it? He started it, after all. It\u2019s elementary knowledge that neither of you are enjoying the tension, but it\u2019s also just as easy to tell that it\u2019s a tension that can\u2019t be easily dispelled after the memory of the previous night, a memory that the both of you are pleadingly desperate to push away from your minds.</p><p>He clears his throat and points towards the exit. \u201cShall we\u2026?\u201d</p><p>Looking everywhere but at him, you nod and take the lead. Your heels echo loudly in the hallway, but instead of giving you the confidence you needed, you find yourself straining your calves so that they don\u2019t land as loudly against the floors. Harry trailing right behind you fills you up with a certain pressure to appear more appealing than you felt \u2013 and you felt like utter <i>shit</i> \u2013 and it takes everything in you to refrain from looking down at your heels or crossing your arms in front of you as you walked.</p><p>The walk in the hallway alone felt like the longest exam you\u2019ve ever had to sit for, and you\u2019ve sat through unbearably long exams in the past. Yet, when you\u2019re about to approach his Range Rover (which, although he should seriously consider getting his windows tinted, you think, the Rover is a safe choice), Harry\u2019s hand cups your shoulder to stop you from going any further. You slow your step. Despite your frustrations about the different precautions you have to take when the two of you are in public, you decide to comply yet again this time. </p><p>Instinctively, as with the many times you\u2019ve went out with him in the past, you reach for his hand and stay close behind him as he walks ahead of you, and you shake your head subtly at the way your hand tightens its grip on his large, calloused one when you start hearing cameras clicking around you. Harry has gotten restraining orders against the paparazzi in the past, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from sneaking up on him (and inevitably, you) from a distance. </p><p>Moments like this put your mind into overdrive. Do you dip your head down? Would that make you look guilty? Do you look up, then? You don\u2019t have any makeup on, though.</p><p>Harry senses that you\u2019re unsettled. He glances to you and squeezes your hand, sending a smile your way. \u201cI\u2019m here. It\u2019s alright.\u201d You nod hesitantly, and he looks back ahead, picking up his pace towards the car.</p><p>Is it really okay, though? Ever since a particularly bogus and brutal article was released about you in the past, claiming you were rude to staff members at a bistro because you just happened to be frowning in deep thought at the menu, you picked up a tendency of overanalysing your own movements and gestures. Suddenly, you aren\u2019t all too happy about your decision to wear last night\u2019s dress \u2013 though on second thought, maybe it would\u2019ve been better than if you emerged in Ash\u2019s sweats.</p><p>You scoff at yourself when you realise what you\u2019re doing. <i>Even when you know the truth behind what\u2019s happening here, are you really doubting your own intentions?</i></p><p>The car beeps to life, and the relief that washes over you when you\u2019re finally in arm\u2019s reach of the car would\u2019ve made you laugh any other day. Harry opens the door on the passenger\u2019s side for you, his hand comfortingly reaching for your back, and you climb in with a restrained sigh as he shuts the door. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous how much you hate the familiar pine scent of car\u2019s interior right now. Your eyes follow him through the windshield as he strides briskly to the other side of the car, and by the time he\u2019s in, you\u2019re staring blankly outside, your heart awaiting the plunge of the conversation that\u2019s about to ensue.</p><p>\u201cTake me to a hotel,\u201d you blurt. You see him turn his head slightly, but you can only guess that he\u2019s not reacting much wilder because the two of you are under the scrutiny of the public eye.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry.\u201d</p><p>You know you\u2019re presenting him with a challenging dilemma here, but it\u2019s about time your needs are met. You have tried to be understanding of his situation, God<i> knows </i>you\u2019ve tried. You don\u2019t want to be the next one to break his heart or be the one who makes him lose faith in love, but you\u2019re not sure if you can do this anymore. You\u2019re sick of pandering to his needs all the time just because he\u2019s a celebrity. You\u2019re sick of being second to none.</p><p>You hear him get extremely quiet. Not a sign of a sigh nor a breath. The sounds of the stereo and the droning of the car overtake the space. The air is fragile. </p><p>In that moment, the both of you are afraid to move. But out of your better interests, Harry places one hand on the wheel and another on the gear, and you turn off the stereo although it\u2019s halfway through <i>Irreplaceable</i>. You don\u2019t need your heart to break the next time you listen to Beyonc\u00e9. </p><p>He pulls out of the parking spot, and you prepare yourself for the long trip he\u2019ll take to lose the paps\u2019 snooping trail. </p><br><p>Your arms are crossed, and you\u2019re letting your vision ping-pong among the streetlamps passing down the moderately busy road. It\u2019s taking a lot for you not to cry, so you\u2019ve let a soundless, stray tear fall. Then another, and another, until so many have fallen that you\u2019re numb and you\u2019re seeing the streetlamps again.</p><p>You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening next to you, and it\u2019s not something you think you\u2019d want to know either. </p><p>You\u2019re thankful, but also slightly disappointed, when he follows through with your request. He\u2019s driving you into the indoor parking lot of a very golden hotel you don\u2019t bother to catch the name of. The parking lot is a jarring asphalt grey, lit by yellow lights placed distantly apart from each other. You spot a good number of cars, from brands you\u2019d require a couple years of salary\u2019s worth to afford, taking up spaces.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pay for this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d you both tacitly acknowledge the word only when it\u2019s too late, and it stuns you out of any response you could possibly come up with, \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>He continues the drive, finally settling on a parking spot that\u2019s further in and more private. The closer the car comes to a stop, the more anxious you feel yourself becoming. It shows when you begin picking on the hem of your dress. </p><p>The car comes to a slow halt. Neither of you make a move.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>The dreaded words come from Harry\u2019s dry throat. You chuckle dryly, not speaking for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Your statement is suspended, incomplete, and the two of you know it. You\u2019re not really responding to his question more than you\u2019re expressing how overwhelming all this is to you. It feels colder than before, so you raise your shoulders and bring your arms closer to yourself. </p><p>He notices, and turns down the air-conditioning. A heavy, pregnant pause sits like a brick wall between you two.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry.\u201d Your eyes fixate on the glove compartment you\u2019d hit about twelve hours ago, your fingers reach up to fiddle with it in anxiety. \u201cThis is a lot for me,\u201d you shake your head, still refusing to face him.</p><p>If there\u2019s one thing you appreciate about him, it\u2019s that he lets you think. For someone who values being understood, his action is much more precious than it sounds. You know how hard it can be for someone like him, who could possibly be even more misunderstood than you, especially with the spotlight constantly on him and expectations weighing on him all the time.</p><p>But this is about you. So, as your fingers fiddle, you think. You are more than aware of the fact that you are navigating a field of landmines with this conversation.</p><p>\u201cEven as I say that, I don\u2019t think you get the extent of how much this is for me,\u201d you continue, no longer able to visualise how <i>public </i>your relationship is. \u201cThe fact that we are sitting in this closed parking lot to talk\u2026\u201d</p><p>You blink, unable to process what you\u2019re even saying. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even have an argument at Ash\u2019s outdoor parking lot, because this whole thing\u2026 my whole life\u2026 your whole life\u2026 revolves around\u2026\u201d you face him, \u201cyou. Revolves around protecting your image. Your cred, your rep. Everything I do goes back to you. Everything I do has your name on it instead of mine. I\u2019m not Y/N. I\u2019m Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d You remember the conversation you have with Yuan Ling the previous night, and it makes you grimace in exasperation that that is all you amounted to.</p><p>You scoff. \u201cYou know what doesn\u2019t help? When I have victories like that stupid project I\u2019ve been working my ass off for nearly a whole year, and even then, I can\u2019t have my one night of joy, because Harry Styles is working on something on his phone with other people. Harry Styles could be taking a fucking nap and Y/N could be curing cancer, and Harry Styles will still be more important than Y/N.\u201d You straighten your back, and you feel yourself raising your voice. \u201cThat has always been okay because it was public opinion that I couldn\u2019t care less for,\u201d your hands wildly gesture, \u201cbut to be reminded of that, by <i>you</i>? Harry, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Through that, he is biting harder and harder at the inside of his cheek, but you can only focus on trying to hold yourself back from the heaviness in your chest. You wipe the tear that has found its way down your face.</p><p>\u201cYou have the entire world holding you up. Who do I have? I\u2019ve weeded people out of my circle for you. I could\u2019ve been with my small handful of friends, but I chose you. I always choose you when you\u2019re around, when you\u2019re an option, and I will always continue to choose you because you deserve the world. I wouldn\u2019t choose them, wouldn\u2019t choose my phone.\u201d You shrug. Where is the anger when you needed it? \u201cSo, tell me, Harry. Why is it so hard for you to choose <i>me</i>?\u201d your voice cracks at the end, and that\u2019s when you stop trying to hold it together. You unbuckle your seatbelt, and you\u2019re ready to leave just like the last time.</p><p>Only this time, you hear all the doors being locked and his hand on yours. Your head whips to face Harry, and you see his other hand on the master locks on the driver\u2019s door. </p><p>\u201cM\u2019not letting you go. Not again.\u201d An enormous load of regret precipitates its way into you when you take a good look of his countenance for the first time today. His eyebrows are knit, a deepened crease implanting itself onto his forehead. His eyes are a deep contrast of red lines amidst white and against green. There are dark, embossed semicircles under his eyes. His lips are bitten to a furious pink, and they stand out against the faint stubble forming around it. </p><p>You know what he means when he says that, and you don\u2019t pull your hand away from his touch, but you do scowl in spite of his worn-out face. \u201cWhat discovery did you make while I was away? Why do you want me now?\u201d</p><p>He purses his dry lips and lets his head hang, and you wonder how he doesn\u2019t feel the sting from putting them under so much pressure for the past few hours. Even when he wordlessly parts his lips and you can still see the cogs turning in his head, you don\u2019t know if you have the patience to await his response.</p><p>But you wait, knowing that little can emerge out of hostility, and knowing that despite all his talent and skills, openness is one trait he\u2019s learning to pick up again. <i>I don\u2019t want to be the one to reverse that process. </i>Your hand returns to the glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out of the car, shouldn\u2019t have been using my phone on your night\u2026 <i>fuck. </i>I don\u2019t know why I did all that. Wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d He drops his head and brings his hand to his face, his curls lightly springing when he shakes his head. </p><p>His teeth remain on his bottom lip, desperately hoping that with every periodic \u201cfuck\u201d he mutters, the memory that\u2019s weighing him down with so much regret would chop itself out of his mind. </p><p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s regretted anything he\u2019s ever done this much. In the past few hours, he had been pacing back and forth, pinching his eyes shut in remorse and sighing in frustration so much that his eyes are sore, and his throat is uncomfortably warm even for someone who sings for a living. He didn\u2019t know how much he lost until he was back in his unnecessarily huge living room, feet gliding on his six-thousand-over dollars carpet, blatantly ignoring his dermatologist\u2019s words when he picks his face that is reflected back to him every time he walks past his career achievements hanging undusted on the tall walls. The only thing his senses pick up amidst all the opulence and admiration he is surrounded by every day, amidst the crowds chanting his name and singing his words back to him, is how deafening the silence is in his own home without you.</p><p>He feels himself panic in fear that his silence is getting a little too long, and that you\u2019re getting a little intolerant of him as he watches the glove compartment open and shut, open and shut, open. Pushing his hair away from his face, he slowly speaks the words he doesn\u2019t want you to misunderstand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m selfish. What I did yesterday, and all those times I was on my phone\u2026\u201d \u2013 he mumbles what you assume is an admonishment to himself \u2013 \u201c\u2026it was all selfish of me. I\u2026 I can\u2019t excuse myself. And if you can\u2019t forgive me I understand because I wouldn\u2019t forgive me either, fuck.\u201d He shakes his head again towards the end of his ramble.</p><p>You swallow, playing with one of his chunky rings you found inside the compartment. He continues. \u201cWhat did I discover last night? Everything that I have, everything that you think I have, everything that I thought I have, is nothing.\u201d Without missing a beat, he stresses it again so hard, that you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t get how empty his nothing is.</p><p>\u201c<i>Nothing</i>. The music, the money, the attention. They could all disappear, and it wouldn\u2019t be half as bad because they only exist as long as Harry Styles exists. But you?\u201d his voice weakens to a high-pitched whisper. In the parking lot of one of the most elite and expensive hotels around, in the car so carefully maintained and running on the best fuel, he is disillusioned.</p><p> \u201cYou are the only person around me who knows me. Knows me for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have your friends\u2026 and Gemma, and your mum\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not you, Y/N.\u201d His hands are shaking yours urgently, and your fingers tighten around his. \u201cYou are who I want to come home to. You are the one I want to share my world with.\u201d</p><p>You feel your tears dripping on your hands as this dilemma rips you apart on the inside. You just want everything to be okay, to get back to normal, to go home and be the music that gives him meaning. </p><p>Instead, you force your words past your yearning for comfort.</p><p>\u201cBut, Harry,\u201d you ask him the one question you don\u2019t want to ask. Not after everything he revealed to you. \u201cWhy were you on your phone?\u201d</p><p>With too much difficulty, you look up into his wide, constricted green eyes, caught off-guard by your question. He whispers.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2026 s\u2019working.\u201d</p><p>You nod, finally turning your gaze away. \u201cIt was Harry Styles, the musician, that I was with the past few weeks, then, wasn\u2019t it? You\u2019re working, you\u2019re Harry Styles, even when you\u2019re with me. To everyone else, it\u2019s Harry Styles that I\u2019m with wherever I go, not Harry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cPlease, just\u2026 let me stay. I\u2014\u201d you can see him tearing at his seams, and it makes your heart shatter for the millionth time. You don\u2019t want to be the one to bring him this torture, and the pressure, the guilt, the pain, it\u2019s all building up inside you. \u201cI know I\u2019m a lot to deal with, my personality, my job\u2014 I can\u2019t help it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I can either, Harry!\u201d you burst in exclamation, loudly gasping as you finally give in to the sobs that you\u2019ve been holding back ever since the start of it all. </p><p>Your outburst dispels the tension that has been clouding the dim interior of the car. A quiet, vulnerable symphony ensues, a sob or a particularly sharp gasp emitting from either of you. You hug your knees close to your chest in the shadows, needing warmth and comfort from something, anything. You hate how through all of this, you want to be the one holding him, knowing he truly has it much worse than you do, yet little did you know that he was thinking the same thing as he crosses his arms tightly to himself. It takes a while before your cries become sniffles or the occasional hiccup, and through it all, as much as you felt like leaving, you couldn\u2019t move if he was there with you.</p><p>It\u2019s Harry who speaks up again, his hoarse voice piercing the space. \u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201d</p><p>You are terrified of how absolute the question is. So, you stay honest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t know how much more I can hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to let you go, but I don\u2019t want you to be in pain because you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Neither of you speak again for a while. You run your thumb along the ring in your hand. It\u2019s gotten warm from your touch, having played around with it since you found it.</p><p>You hear him humourlessly chuckle next to you. \u201cGot that in Greece, remember?\u201d</p><p>In spite of everything that transpired, the weakest smile perks up the corner of your lip. Greece. Of course, you remember. You\u2019ve always believed it to be the best vacation of your life, because it was with Harry\u2026 just Harry.</p><p>You nod, letting the ring sit on the palm of your hand. Another wave of tears threatens to fall, though this time, they\u2019re sweet, reminiscent ones. You\u2019re reminded of the joys of being with him. Waking up next to him, being the only one to hear his snores in the morning. Your adventures with coffee. The goofy selfies that you keep in your phone and the memories you keep in your heart. The affection he gives to you and no one else, be it through the pet names or the surprise meals or the inside jokes between you two that he peppers in the love songs that never get to see the light of day, the encouraging messages and voice notes he sends you through tough days, the hours he holds you on tougher nights, everything from the small talk to the pillow talk.</p><p>It\u2019s funny, that this is when you feel the \u2018L\u2019 word on your tongue. How can you call it that, though, if you give it all up? Your mind always returns to the question of whether you\u2019re willing to give \u2018Y/N\u2019 up for \u2018Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the world looking in on us is too much for you\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t protected you well from it.\u201d He sighs tiredly. </p><p>\u2026 But hasn\u2019t he given up Harry for Harry Styles as well? All those times that the two of you have gone out together, the cameras capture Harry Styles and Harry Styles\u2019 girlfriend\u2026 not Harry and Y/N.</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams, we are one. S\u2019not about me, though. The ball\u2019s in your court.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know if what you\u2019re doing is a mistake. Only time will tell.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows are raised in hope that he heard you right. You eye him back timidly, short enough for him to unbuckle his seatbelt and reach for you in the wildest chase he can to hold you in case this was all a dream. Clamouring, he lunges his huge self towards you and buries his head into your neck, now wet with his tears, and you have to withhold your whimper at finally being able to feel him on you. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk conditions. Rules. Guidelines, Harry, you hear?\u201d you croak as you stretch towards him to hold him close to you.</p><p>\u201cAnything for my Y/N.\u201d He presses kisses up your neck and jaw, emitting a relieved laugh from you. \u201cHarry\u2019s Y/N.\u201d You almost sob again as he presses his lips onto yours, bringing his hand up to your jaw and you kiss him back. The both of you part unwillingly, but breathless, and not letting your sight leave his green eyes that are transfixed with yours.</p><p>You speak, just above a whisper. \u201cYou need to stop biting your lips.\u201d He smirks humorously and rolls his eyes, earning a giggle from you that sends a small, loving grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work this out, I promise.\u201d </p><hr><p>let me know what you think <a href=\"http://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>! read the author\u2019s note <a href=\"https://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/post/178692469101/authors-note-to-call-me-when-youre-done-pt-3\">here</a>!</p><p>taglist (i\u2019m quite sure i\u2019m missing a few names out!): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qcrVNJ3v2TGbs00AQOE7A\">@mywastedtimes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\">@whereishisgrammy</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84KC_UFlzs4Ex4YPfN8eEA\">@emmamonson21</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLTjhAU6NUYX5SqUBAwjJrQ\">@pinkliquorstyles</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDuwCgfmaneuWzUMVoH1w8w\">@im-cool-ask-my-mom</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFOMBVJSWULVv5Y-BoER_TA\">@meetmeinthehallwaydotmp3</a></p>",

Not that he isn&rsquo;t usually kind, but you felt assured that he&rsquo;s definitely got your back. Not only did he pick you up after you left him some cryptic message; he let you sleep in his bed while he took the couch (which you&rsquo;d been asking him to replace for a while now), he let you have the last earl grey teabag he had lying around in the kitchen, he let you choose the show you wanted to watch instead of letting him continue his F.R.I.E.N.D.S rerun. Hell, he even let you vent about the whole situation without interruption, even when you didn&rsquo;t understand yourself half the time from all the unfiltered thoughts shooting out in between sentences.</p><p>Ash himself? He didn&rsquo;t care too much for sleeping on his bed, or tea, or TV. He doesn&rsquo;t care much for Y/N either, really, but having you around was okay. At least he wasn&rsquo;t alone, and you could be really interesting sometimes. A part of him has some sort of adoration for you ever since you first established yourself to be a brilliant law student to your class and professors, but he&rsquo;s always seen you as an icky little sister more than anything else.</p><p>As you found yourself waking up in an unfamiliar bedroom, a wave of panic rushed through you until you caught sight of your dress hanging on the hook on the wall and you&rsquo;re reminded of last night&rsquo;s disaster. With a frown, a long exhale escapes your nostrils as you let yourself fall back onto\nthe pillows.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t want to face him, but you don&rsquo;t want to bother Ash either. You rake your hands through your messed-up hair and tug at your roots. You groan in even greater frustration when you think about having to go home in yesterday&rsquo;s outfit, and how bad that would look if pictures got out.</p><p>You stop yourself. There it is again. Your life has grown to revolve around his, and if that one thought doesn&rsquo;t prove it, you don&rsquo;t know what does. You sigh yet again, but you can&rsquo;t help that you automatically start desperately wishing that one of the Kardashians did something to throw a blanket over any news that could possibly have be published about your relationship in the last twelve hours.</p><p>For a moment you entertain the thought of going online and\nchecking out if any damage has been done. Somehow, it has never, ever kicked in for you, despite the countless times you&rsquo;ve done it, that going online when you&rsquo;re curious only ever leads to a complete plummet in your mood. You don&rsquo;t even remember how many times it&rsquo;s been that you&rsquo;d succumb to your curiosity, go onto Twitter to search up your name alongside Harry&rsquo;s, and instantly regret it when you make sense of all the hatred you get for being his girlfriend. Everything in you is itching to get online, and despite the protests in your head, you don&rsquo;t really stop yourself from reaching into your clutch to fish your phone out. You let it power on, and as you&rsquo;re about to yield to your craving for melodrama, your boyfriend&rsquo;s texts from last night sliding up and down your status bar stop you.</p><p><b><i>4 missed calls</i></b></p><p><i>[21:02]: I&rsquo;m so sorry, my love</i></p><p><i>[21:05]: Can we talk about this?</i></p><p><i>[21:24]: Where are you?</i></p><p><i>[22:19]: God, Y/N, please tell me you&rsquo;re safe.</i></p><p><i>[03:48]: I&rsquo;m so, so sorry. I love you. I have no right to ask you of this but I know you and I beg you to stay off the web. At least until we work it out.</i></p><p>A twang invades your chest as you register the urgency in his tone, and you feel your face contort into a saddened frown from the dilemma that brews in your entire being after reading his messages. Your despair is immediately replaced with anxiety when you notice three grey dots appear mere seconds after you&rsquo;ve read your messages.</p><p><i>[08:09]: I&rsquo;m so sorry.</i></p><p><i>[08:09]: And good morning, love.</i> </p><p>You swallow with difficulty and bite your bottom lip before it can sink any further. Your thumbs hover over the screen. On one hand, you&rsquo;re dying to let him know you&rsquo;re okay if it means he wouldn&rsquo;t worry about you. <i>Did he even sleep at all last night? </i>On the other hand, you selfishly want him to experience the sort of worry that you do for him, and if that means coldly refusing to respond to him, then so be it. </p><p>&hellip; Right?</p><p>You toss your phone back into your clutch before you can go back on your decision. As far as you&rsquo;re concerned, he is not getting an ounce of satisfaction out of this. It&rsquo;s unfair enough as it is &ndash; now that you&rsquo;ve read his texts, you know that there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re getting any peace of mind in the next few hours&hellip; maybe even days.</p><p>The sun&rsquo;s rays beating the walls of the room ironically darkens your mood further. Of all the things you feel today, cheery is not one of them. Throwing the hoodie Ash lent you over your head and tightening the sweatpants he&rsquo;d let you borrow, you let the slippers shuffle you out of the bedroom.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve taken it upon yourself to get a steaming cup&rsquo;s equivalent of coffee in your veins within the next hour. You take lighter steps when you see your friend&rsquo;s half-naked body still slackened, loose and drooling in slumber, and a part of you wonders how he&rsquo;s able to sleep so well on that lumpy, older than Beethoven couch. Shaking your head, you create a mental note to bring him window-shopping for couches one of these days. Maybe even get him a proper couch yourself.</p><p>With the thought lingering in your head among other memories from the previous night, you mindlessly pull the utensils and ingredients for your coffee and brew a jug enough for you and the sleepyhead on the other side of the apartment, not realising until later when Ash mumbled something about the coffee being thick that you had brewed it the way you and Harry grew to love your morning cuppa.</p><br /><p>In the living room, you&rsquo;re cross-legged on the couch with Ash&rsquo;s laptop resting on your legs. You&rsquo;ve got your inbox open and you&rsquo;re\nsifting through your emails &ndash; yet, for someone who goes through emails like it&rsquo;s second nature, you were going through them at a suspiciously slow pace. Your glassy eyes staring at the corner of the laptop, you don&rsquo;t realise it, but your thoughts are still stuck in the darkness of yesterday.</p><p>Ash emerges from his bedroom carrying a gym bag. When he\ncatches your distracted statue on his couch, he detours to the kitchen instead of letting himself be seen as he wonders if he should ask you about it or simply flick your attention away from your thoughts. Grabbing a banana from the counter, he sighs as he watches the back of your head staring down at the stagnant screen, and he walks towards the entrance while clearing his throat. His little cough draws you away from your screen, and you look up to him with wide, curious eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;going to the gym for a while. Will you be fine on your own?&rdquo; he dips his head slightly, and you find his concerned hazel eyes examining yours. You acknowledge the flurry of things zooming through your head at his question &ndash; <i>On my own? I&rsquo;m not even fine with you here. But I can&rsquo;t possibly stop you from going, what good will that do? Y/N, just give him the easy answer &ndash; </i>and you&rsquo;re about to nod.</p><p>The ding of the doorbell brings both of your gazes to the door. A confused expression takes over your features as you turn back to him, but the single eyebrow he raises seems to prove that he&rsquo;s just as unsure as you are, and you&rsquo;re left to imagine it&rsquo;s a door-to-door salesman or a couple of Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses preaching their Lord&rsquo;s word with every door that is opened.</p><p>You return to your emails with the intrusive thoughts invading your focus less this time, and this time you even manage to rapidly click away at the keyboard as you type a sentence in.</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p>You look up again at Ash, who&rsquo;s leaning against the door and has his back turned towards you.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>The two words are enough to make your head whirl and your breath shallow, and you have to lean back and clutch tightly to the fabric of your seat to stabilise yourself. Wild eyed, you shake your head at Ash and you begin to get up as you feel a cry slowly rising up your throat, carrying the laptop with you. You see him opening the door by a crack and you hear a muffled exchange, but you pull the bedroom door quietly shut before you can hear or see the one who brought you so much anger and hurt in the past 12 hours. </p><p><i>What the hell does he want? Why does he think it&rsquo;s okay to drag his ass all the way here? </i>Your feet, for whatever reason, bring you to the mirror on the wall, and your scowl only deepens when you see how horrid you look. Is this how you looked like last night, when you slammed the door in his face?</p><p>You can feel your jaw beginning to tremble and a ghost of a sob lurking in the back of your throat, but sucking in a cool, deep breath through your parted lips, you flip your feelings before they can manifest in another wet fit. Instead, you tighten your hands into fists, revelling in the way angry, red semicircles form on the palms of your hand.</p><p>You&rsquo;re trying hard not to leave a scene for Ash to clean up after, but you can&rsquo;t help that you&rsquo;re yanking your phone from the charger as you think about how your life revolves around your boyfriend and how entitled he thinks he is, showing up at your best friend&rsquo;s house when you&rsquo;re trying to give him a taste of his own medicine with your absence. That&rsquo;s not to say you don&rsquo;t feel the tinge of pride and security, of course, that he&rsquo;s begging for you at the door right now. You kick your slippers off, aligning them one atop the other. </p><br /><p>The breath Harry had been holding comes out in a disappointed sigh when Ash opens the door instead of you. &ldquo;Hey, uh&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sup.&rdquo; Ash raises his eyebrows at the absurdity and irony of his own response. Despite your name being the tacit tension that makes the air thick between the two men, Ash doesn&rsquo;t succumb to his usual carefree self by inviting Harry in. Instead, the gap of the door remains small, and he finds himself straightening his back when he notices the unwelcome visitor straining his neck to search inside the apartment. Harry catches his gesture, reverting his piercing gaze to the man blocking his view and feeling the pride build up in his chest when he averts his sight quickly with a swallow.</p><p>&ldquo;Look, mate,&rdquo; Ash speaks up first, and he tries to keep his voice low since he knows you&rsquo;re in enough distress as it is. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna get in the middle of any of this, yeah? But she seems pissed with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know&mdash;just&hellip;&rdquo; he exhales, head hanging low and hands on his hips. &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p><p>Ash observes the darkened bags under his bloodshot eyes, and\nhow he&rsquo;s just a little less unkempt than he normally is: the dress shirt he has on is crumpled and the cuffs aren&rsquo;t buttoned, his hair doesn&rsquo;t have the same neat messiness that&rsquo;s typical of him. &ldquo;S&rsquo;not for me to answer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then can I speak to her?&rdquo; he seizes the opportunity the\nmoment he hears the response, snapping up with hopeful eyes. Selfishly, he wishes that this is the one time his supposed universal charm works on his girlfriend&rsquo;s best friend, but when he sees him puffing his chest out a little, he knows it doesn&rsquo;t really work to his favour this time.</p><p>Ash doesn&rsquo;t expect that he has a protective streak for you, and he&rsquo;s certain he doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; yet he allows himself a small dig since you aren&rsquo;t around to reprimand him. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d listen to her wishes, mate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t push it, <i>bud</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with him, Ash.&rdquo;</p><p>Both pair of eyes dart towards the sound of your voice, where you are strutting up to the door with an eye-roll and with your belongings bundled up in your hands. You&rsquo;ve changed back into your dress from the previous night, knowing full well there will be lenses outside ready to twist and publish the story into more than it actually is &ndash; just as you intend it to be, especially after the emotional hell you&rsquo;ve been put through by the wide-eyed moron on the other side of the door.</p><p>You bring a hand up to your friend&rsquo;s arm, sending him the most genuine half-smile you can muster, and you speak &ndash; despite the look of concern he gives you, and despite Harry listening. &ldquo;Thanks for having my back, don&rsquo;t wanna keep bothering you. I owe you one, yeah? I left your clothes in the\nlaundry bag,&rdquo; you proceed forward, but halt as an afterthought pops into your head, &ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll get you more teabags next time, and we <i>will</i> find you a better couch, whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; he simply replies, and he taps at his forehead four times, <i>I&rsquo;ll be right here.</i> A tiny exhale of a laugh escapes your lips at the understanding of your E.T. inside joke being communicated to you, and you return it by signing thanks. Stepping out, you avoid your boyfriend&rsquo;s gaze. Though, as petty as it may seem, you revel ever so slightly when you notice that from your periphery, he acts upon a tell &ndash; a reflex he always resorts to when he&rsquo;s jealous. You see his arm reaching out for your waist, but he retracts it in hesitation just as quickly, playing it off as an itch on his arm. <i>Good call, </i>you mentally snicker.</p><p>You glance up at him, neither of you daring to hold eye contact for too long as you nod in greeting. Being stuck with him suddenly fills you with regret that things turned out the way they did. Hands to yourself. Unfamiliar expressions. Unspoken words. Yet, it&rsquo;s not something you can help, is it? He started it, after all. It&rsquo;s elementary knowledge that neither of you are enjoying the tension, but it&rsquo;s also just as easy to tell that it&rsquo;s a tension that can&rsquo;t be easily dispelled after the memory of the previous night, a memory that the both of you are pleadingly desperate to push away from your minds.</p><p>He clears his throat and points towards the exit. &ldquo;Shall we&hellip;?&rdquo;</p><p>Looking everywhere but at him, you nod and take the lead. Your heels echo loudly in the hallway, but instead of giving you the confidence you needed, you find yourself straining your calves so that they don&rsquo;t land as loudly against the floors. Harry trailing right behind you fills you up with a certain pressure to appear more appealing than you felt &ndash; and you felt like utter <i>shit</i> &ndash; and it takes everything in you to refrain from looking down at your heels or crossing your arms in front of you as you walked.</p><p>The walk in the hallway alone felt like the longest exam you&rsquo;ve ever had to sit for, and you&rsquo;ve sat through unbearably long exams in the past. Yet, when you&rsquo;re about to approach his Range Rover (which, although he should seriously consider getting his windows tinted, you think, the Rover is a safe choice), Harry&rsquo;s hand cups your shoulder to stop you from going any further. You slow your step. Despite your frustrations about the different precautions you have to take when the two of you are in public, you decide to comply yet again this time. </p><p>Instinctively, as with the many times you&rsquo;ve went out with him in the past, you reach for his hand and stay close behind him as he walks ahead of you, and you shake your head subtly at the way your hand tightens its grip on his large, calloused one when you start hearing cameras clicking around you. Harry has gotten restraining orders against the paparazzi in the past, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from sneaking up on him (and inevitably, you) from a distance. </p><p>Moments like this put your mind into overdrive. Do you dip your head down? Would that make you look guilty? Do you look up, then? You don&rsquo;t have any makeup on, though.</p><p>Harry senses that you&rsquo;re unsettled. He glances to you and squeezes your hand, sending a smile your way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. It&rsquo;s alright.&rdquo; You nod hesitantly, and he looks back ahead, picking up his pace towards the car.</p><p>Is it really okay, though? Ever since a particularly bogus and brutal article was released about you in the past, claiming you were rude to staff members at a bistro because you just happened to be frowning in deep thought at the menu, you picked up a tendency of overanalysing your own movements and gestures. Suddenly, you aren&rsquo;t all too happy about your decision to wear last night&rsquo;s dress &ndash; though on second thought, maybe it would&rsquo;ve been better than if you emerged in Ash&rsquo;s sweats.</p><p>You scoff at yourself when you realise what you&rsquo;re doing. <i>Even when you know the truth behind what&rsquo;s happening here, are you really doubting your own intentions?</i></p><p>The car beeps to life, and the relief that washes over you when you&rsquo;re finally in arm&rsquo;s reach of the car would&rsquo;ve made you laugh any other day. Harry opens the door on the passenger&rsquo;s side for you, his hand comfortingly reaching for your back, and you climb in with a restrained sigh as he shuts the door. It&rsquo;s absolutely ridiculous how much you hate the familiar pine scent of car&rsquo;s interior right now. Your eyes follow him through the windshield as he strides briskly to the other side of the car, and by the time he&rsquo;s in, you&rsquo;re staring blankly outside, your heart awaiting the plunge of the conversation that&rsquo;s about to ensue.</p><p>&ldquo;Take me to a hotel,&rdquo; you blurt. You see him turn his head slightly, but you can only guess that he&rsquo;s not reacting much wilder because the two of you are under the scrutiny of the public eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t do this now&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry.&rdquo;</p><p>You know you&rsquo;re presenting him with a challenging dilemma here, but it&rsquo;s about time your needs are met. You have tried to be understanding of his situation, God<i> knows </i>you&rsquo;ve tried. You don&rsquo;t want to be the next one to break his heart or be the one who makes him lose faith in love, but you&rsquo;re not sure if you can do this anymore. You&rsquo;re sick of pandering to his needs all the time just because he&rsquo;s a celebrity. You&rsquo;re sick of being second to none.</p><p>You hear him get extremely quiet. Not a sign of a sigh nor a breath. The sounds of the stereo and the droning of the car overtake the space. The air is fragile. </p><p>In that moment, the both of you are afraid to move. But out of your better interests, Harry places one hand on the wheel and another on the gear, and you turn off the stereo although it&rsquo;s halfway through <i>Irreplaceable</i>. You don&rsquo;t need your heart to break the next time you listen to Beyonc&eacute;. </p><p>He pulls out of the parking spot, and you prepare yourself for the long trip he&rsquo;ll take to lose the paps&rsquo; snooping trail. </p><br /><p>Your arms are crossed, and you&rsquo;re letting your vision ping-pong among the streetlamps passing down the moderately busy road. It&rsquo;s taking a lot for you not to cry, so you&rsquo;ve let a soundless, stray tear fall. Then another, and another, until so many have fallen that you&rsquo;re numb and you&rsquo;re seeing the streetlamps again.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening next to you, and it&rsquo;s not something you think you&rsquo;d want to know either. </p><p>You&rsquo;re thankful, but also slightly disappointed, when he follows through with your request. He&rsquo;s driving you into the indoor parking lot of a very golden hotel you don&rsquo;t bother to catch the name of. The parking lot is a jarring asphalt grey, lit by yellow lights placed distantly apart from each other. You spot a good number of cars, from brands you&rsquo;d require a couple years of salary&rsquo;s worth to afford, taking up spaces.</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay for this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not paying&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; you both tacitly acknowledge the word only when it&rsquo;s too late, and it stuns you out of any response you could possibly come up with, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least I can do for you.&rdquo;</p><p>He continues the drive, finally settling on a parking spot that&rsquo;s further in and more private. The closer the car comes to a stop, the more anxious you feel yourself becoming. It shows when you begin picking on the hem of your dress. </p><p>The car comes to a slow halt. Neither of you make a move.</p><p>&ldquo;Can we talk?&rdquo;</p><p>The dreaded words come from Harry&rsquo;s dry throat. You chuckle dryly, not speaking for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>Your statement is suspended, incomplete, and the two of you know it. You&rsquo;re not really responding to his question more than you&rsquo;re expressing how overwhelming all this is to you. It feels colder than before, so you raise your shoulders and bring your arms closer to yourself. </p><p>He notices, and turns down the air-conditioning. A heavy, pregnant pause sits like a brick wall between you two.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry.&rdquo; Your eyes fixate on the glove compartment you&rsquo;d hit about twelve hours ago, your fingers reach up to fiddle with it in anxiety. &ldquo;This is a lot for me,&rdquo; you shake your head, still refusing to face him.</p><p>If there&rsquo;s one thing you appreciate about him, it&rsquo;s that he lets you think. For someone who values being understood, his action is much more precious than it sounds. You know how hard it can be for someone like him, who could possibly be even more misunderstood than you, especially with the spotlight constantly on him and expectations weighing on him all the time.</p><p>But this is about you. So, as your fingers fiddle, you think. You are more than aware of the fact that you are navigating a field of landmines with this conversation.</p><p>&ldquo;Even as I say that, I don&rsquo;t think you get the extent of how much this is for me,&rdquo; you continue, no longer able to visualise how <i>public </i>your relationship is. &ldquo;The fact that we are sitting in this closed parking lot to talk&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You blink, unable to process what you&rsquo;re even saying. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t even have an argument at Ash&rsquo;s outdoor parking lot, because this whole thing&hellip; my whole life&hellip; your whole life&hellip; revolves around&hellip;&rdquo; you face him, &ldquo;you. Revolves around protecting your image. Your cred, your rep. Everything I do goes back to you. Everything I do has your name on it instead of mine. I&rsquo;m not Y/N. I&rsquo;m Harry Styles&rsquo; girlfriend.&rdquo; You remember the conversation you have with Yuan Ling the previous night, and it makes you grimace in exasperation that that is all you amounted to.</p><p>You scoff. &ldquo;You know what doesn&rsquo;t help? When I have victories like that stupid project I&rsquo;ve been working my ass off for nearly a whole year, and even then, I can&rsquo;t have my one night of joy, because Harry Styles is working on something on his phone with other people. Harry Styles could be taking a fucking nap and Y/N could be curing cancer, and Harry Styles will still be more important than Y/N.&rdquo; You straighten your back, and you feel yourself raising your voice. &ldquo;That has always been okay because it was public opinion that I couldn&rsquo;t care less for,&rdquo; your hands wildly gesture, &ldquo;but to be reminded of that, by <i>you</i>? Harry, I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>Through that, he is biting harder and harder at the inside of his cheek, but you can only focus on trying to hold yourself back from the heaviness in your chest. You wipe the tear that has found its way down your face.</p><p>&ldquo;You have the entire world holding you up. Who do I have? I&rsquo;ve weeded people out of my circle for you. I could&rsquo;ve been with my small handful of friends, but I chose you. I always choose you when you&rsquo;re around, when you&rsquo;re an option, and I will always continue to choose you because you deserve the world. I wouldn&rsquo;t choose them, wouldn&rsquo;t choose my phone.&rdquo; You shrug. Where is the anger when you needed it? &ldquo;So, tell me, Harry. Why is it so hard for you to choose <i>me</i>?&rdquo; your voice cracks at the end, and that&rsquo;s when you stop trying to hold it together. You unbuckle your seatbelt, and you&rsquo;re ready to leave just like the last time.</p><p>Only this time, you hear all the doors being locked and his hand on yours. Your head whips to face Harry, and you see his other hand on the master locks on the driver&rsquo;s door. </p><p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;not letting you go. Not again.&rdquo; An enormous load of regret precipitates its way into you when you take a good look of his countenance for the first time today. His eyebrows are knit, a deepened crease implanting itself onto his forehead. His eyes are a deep contrast of red lines amidst white and against green. There are dark, embossed semicircles under his eyes. His lips are bitten to a furious pink, and they stand out against the faint stubble forming around it. </p><p>You know what he means when he says that, and you don&rsquo;t pull your hand away from his touch, but you do scowl in spite of his worn-out face. &ldquo;What discovery did you make while I was away? Why do you want me now?&rdquo;</p><p>He purses his dry lips and lets his head hang, and you wonder how he doesn&rsquo;t feel the sting from putting them under so much pressure for the past few hours. Even when he wordlessly parts his lips and you can still see the cogs turning in his head, you don&rsquo;t know if you have the patience to await his response.</p><p>But you wait, knowing that little can emerge out of hostility, and knowing that despite all his talent and skills, openness is one trait he&rsquo;s learning to pick up again. <i>I don&rsquo;t want to be the one to reverse that process. </i>Your hand returns to the glove compartment.</p><p>&ldquo;I was wrong. I shouldn&rsquo;t have kicked you out of the car, shouldn&rsquo;t have been using my phone on your night&hellip; <i>fuck. </i>I don&rsquo;t know why I did all that. Wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight.&rdquo; He drops his head and brings his hand to his face, his curls lightly springing when he shakes his head. </p><p>His teeth remain on his bottom lip, desperately hoping that with every periodic &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; he mutters, the memory that&rsquo;s weighing him down with so much regret would chop itself out of his mind. </p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s regretted anything he&rsquo;s ever done this much. In the past few hours, he had been pacing back and forth, pinching his eyes shut in remorse and sighing in frustration so much that his eyes are sore, and his throat is uncomfortably warm even for someone who sings for a living. He didn&rsquo;t know how much he lost until he was back in his unnecessarily huge living room, feet gliding on his six-thousand-over dollars carpet, blatantly ignoring his dermatologist&rsquo;s words when he picks his face that is reflected back to him every time he walks past his career achievements hanging undusted on the tall walls. The only thing his senses pick up amidst all the opulence and admiration he is surrounded by every day, amidst the crowds chanting his name and singing his words back to him, is how deafening the silence is in his own home without you.</p><p>He feels himself panic in fear that his silence is getting a little too long, and that you&rsquo;re getting a little intolerant of him as he watches the glove compartment open and shut, open and shut, open. Pushing his hair away from his face, he slowly speaks the words he doesn&rsquo;t want you to misunderstand.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish. What I did yesterday, and all those times I was on my phone&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; he mumbles what you assume is an admonishment to himself &ndash; &ldquo;&hellip;it was all selfish of me. I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t excuse myself. And if you can&rsquo;t forgive me I understand because I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive me either, fuck.&rdquo; He shakes his head again towards the end of his ramble.</p><p>You swallow, playing with one of his chunky rings you found inside the compartment. He continues. &ldquo;What did I discover last night? Everything that I have, everything that you think I have, everything that I thought I have, is nothing.&rdquo; Without missing a beat, he stresses it again so hard, that you&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t get how empty his nothing is.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Nothing</i>. The music, the money, the attention. They could all disappear, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be half as bad because they only exist as long as Harry Styles exists. But you?&rdquo; his voice weakens to a high-pitched whisper. In the parking lot of one of the most elite and expensive hotels around, in the car so carefully maintained and running on the best fuel, he is disillusioned.</p><p> &ldquo;You are the only person around me who knows me. Knows me for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have your friends&hellip; and Gemma, and your mum&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re not you, Y/N.&rdquo; His hands are shaking yours urgently, and your fingers tighten around his. &ldquo;You are who I want to come home to. You are the one I want to share my world with.&rdquo;</p><p>You feel your tears dripping on your hands as this dilemma rips you apart on the inside. You just want everything to be okay, to get back to normal, to go home and be the music that gives him meaning. </p><p>Instead, you force your words past your yearning for comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;But, Harry,&rdquo; you ask him the one question you don&rsquo;t want to ask. Not after everything he revealed to you. &ldquo;Why were you on your phone?&rdquo;</p><p>With too much difficulty, you look up into his wide, constricted green eyes, caught off-guard by your question. He whispers.</p><p>&ldquo;I was&hellip; s&rsquo;working.&rdquo;</p><p>You nod, finally turning your gaze away. &ldquo;It was Harry Styles, the musician, that I was with the past few weeks, then, wasn&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;re working, you&rsquo;re Harry Styles, even when you&rsquo;re with me. To everyone else, it&rsquo;s Harry Styles that I&rsquo;m with wherever I go, not Harry.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please, just&hellip; let me stay. I&mdash;&rdquo; you can see him tearing at his seams, and it makes your heart shatter for the millionth time. You don&rsquo;t want to be the one to bring him this torture, and the pressure, the guilt, the pain, it&rsquo;s all building up inside you. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a lot to deal with, my personality, my job&mdash; I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know if I can either, Harry!&rdquo; you burst in exclamation, loudly gasping as you finally give in to the sobs that you&rsquo;ve been holding back ever since the start of it all. </p><p>Your outburst dispels the tension that has been clouding the dim interior of the car. A quiet, vulnerable symphony ensues, a sob or a particularly sharp gasp emitting from either of you. You hug your knees close to your chest in the shadows, needing warmth and comfort from something, anything. You hate how through all of this, you want to be the one holding him, knowing he truly has it much worse than you do, yet little did you know that he was thinking the same thing as he crosses his arms tightly to himself. It takes a while before your cries become sniffles or the occasional hiccup, and through it all, as much as you felt like leaving, you couldn&rsquo;t move if he was there with you.</p><p>It&rsquo;s Harry who speaks up again, his hoarse voice piercing the space. &ldquo;Where does this leave us?&rdquo;</p><p>You are terrified of how absolute the question is. So, you stay honest.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to let you go, but I don&rsquo;t know how much more I can hold on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to let you go, but I don&rsquo;t want you to be in pain because you&rsquo;re with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither of you speak again for a while. You run your thumb along the ring in your hand. It&rsquo;s gotten warm from your touch, having played around with it since you found it.</p><p>You hear him humourlessly chuckle next to you. &ldquo;Got that in Greece, remember?&rdquo;</p><p>In spite of everything that transpired, the weakest smile perks up the corner of your lip. Greece. Of course, you remember. You&rsquo;ve always believed it to be the best vacation of your life, because it was with Harry&hellip; just Harry.</p><p>You nod, letting the ring sit on the palm of your hand. Another wave of tears threatens to fall, though this time, they&rsquo;re sweet, reminiscent ones. You&rsquo;re reminded of the joys of being with him. Waking up next to him, being the only one to hear his snores in the morning. Your adventures with coffee. The goofy selfies that you keep in your phone and the memories you keep in your heart. The affection he gives to you and no one else, be it through the pet names or the surprise meals or the inside jokes between you two that he peppers in the love songs that never get to see the light of day, the encouraging messages and voice notes he sends you through tough days, the hours he holds you on tougher nights, everything from the small talk to the pillow talk.</p><p>It&rsquo;s funny, that this is when you feel the &lsquo;L&rsquo; word on your tongue. How can you call it that, though, if you give it all up? Your mind always returns to the question of whether you&rsquo;re willing to give &lsquo;Y/N&rsquo; up for &lsquo;Harry Styles&rsquo; girlfriend&rsquo;.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if the world looking in on us is too much for you&hellip; and I&rsquo;m sorry if I haven&rsquo;t protected you well from it.&rdquo; He sighs tiredly. </p><p>&hellip; But hasn&rsquo;t he given up Harry for Harry Styles as well? All those times that the two of you have gone out together, the cameras capture Harry Styles and Harry Styles&rsquo; girlfriend&hellip; not Harry and Y/N.</p><p>&ldquo;In my dreams, we are one. S&rsquo;not about me, though. The ball&rsquo;s in your court.&rdquo;</p><p>You don&rsquo;t know if what you&rsquo;re doing is a mistake. Only time will tell.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p><p>His eyebrows are raised in hope that he heard you right. You eye him back timidly, short enough for him to unbuckle his seatbelt and reach for you in the wildest chase he can to hold you in case this was all a dream. Clamouring, he lunges his huge self towards you and buries his head into your neck, now wet with his tears, and you have to withhold your whimper at finally being able to feel him on you. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna talk conditions. Rules. Guidelines, Harry, you hear?&rdquo; you croak as you stretch towards him to hold him close to you.</p><p>&ldquo;Anything for my Y/N.&rdquo; He presses kisses up your neck and jaw, emitting a relieved laugh from you. &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s Y/N.&rdquo; You almost sob again as he presses his lips onto yours, bringing his hand up to your jaw and you kiss him back. The both of you part unwillingly, but breathless, and not letting your sight leave his green eyes that are transfixed with yours.</p><p>You speak, just above a whisper. &ldquo;You need to stop biting your lips.&rdquo; He smirks humorously and rolls his eyes, earning a giggle from you that sends a small, loving grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work this out, I promise.&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>let me know what you think <a href=\"http://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>! read the author&rsquo;s note <a href=\"https://isitjamiemoriarty.tumblr.com/post/178692469101/authors-note-to-call-me-when-youre-done-pt-3\">here</a>!</p><p>taglist (i&rsquo;m quite sure i&rsquo;m missing a few names out!): <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m5qcrVNJ3v2TGbs00AQOE7A\">@mywastedtimes</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mcG7LNLDLGpUUvGyz6N0x2w\">@drowninherperfume</a> <a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mQfZP0aUJEn5EcQx8gBwINQ\">@whereishisgrammy</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\"></a><a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mUL6OHs_gc4Qkoa2S5W3_0g\">@swayingnoodlelove</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/m84KC_UFlzs4Ex4YPfN8eEA\">@emmamonson21</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mLTjhAU6NUYX5SqUBAwjJrQ\">@pinkliquorstyles</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mDuwCgfmaneuWzUMVoH1w8w\">@im-cool-ask-my-mom</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tmblr.co/mFOMBVJSWULVv5Y-BoER_TA\">@meetmeinthehallwaydotmp3</a></p>",

Not that he isn&rsquo;t usually kind, but you felt assured that he&rsquo;s definitely got your back. Not only did he pick you up after you left him some cryptic message; he let you sleep in his bed while he took the couch (which you&rsquo;d been asking him to replace for a while now), he let you have the last earl grey teabag he had lying around in the kitchen, he let you choose the show you wanted to watch instead of letting him continue his F.R.I.E.N.D.S rerun. Hell, he even let you vent about the whole situation without interruption, even when you didn&rsquo;t understand yourself half the time from all the unfiltered thoughts shooting out in between sentences.</p>\n</p>",

Being\nthe lead star in one of the summers most anticipated film, all eyes\nwere on her. She was currently getting ready to promote her film. She\nwas being interviewed by the one and only James Corden on the Late\nLate Show. Her first interview of many.</p><p>She had met James many times before and\nwas very fond of him. He was a great guy, and his show was\noutstanding. She was beyond delighted to be asked to do the show, but\ncouldn&rsquo;t stop her heart from racing.</p><p>She was still relatively new to the\nscene, so being in the spotlight was a bit nerve wrecking. Knowing\nthis, James assured her he would take it easy on her.</p><p>Harry was also suppose to be making an\nappearance. Harry Styles was playing Jasper Carter, her hot and\nsteamy love interest.</p><p>Luna had met Harry first at auditions.\nHe had left her a little baffled, in the beginning. Of course, she\nhad known who Harry was. Everyone in the world had to have known him\nby now. She had to admit, she was quite a big fan of his. She had\neven seen him in concert, a few months before.</p><p>She had not known what to expect of\nhim. Knowing how big of a star he was, she had assumed he would be a\nbit stuck up. However, he had been quite the opposite. Upon arrival,\nHarry had walked straight up to her. He introduced himself and gave\nher a warm hug. He made sure she had been completely at ease the\nentire day. They ran lines with each other from multiple different\nscenes. Their chemistry had been undeniable, and they left the\ndirectors speechless. They didn&rsquo;t have to wait long before receiving\nthe call and being offered the part. A few days later, she had\nreceived an enormous bouquet of red roses from Harry congratulating\nher.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>She had been over the moon, when she\nwas told he would be her costar. Knowing he would be with her\nthroughout the entire process, she felt relieved. With it being her\nfirst major film, she had been beyond stressed. She couldn&rsquo;t help but\nworry she would mess things up.</p><p>It had been her lifelong dream to\nbecome a highly known actress. She wanted to star along side of the\nbiggest named celebrities and wouldn&rsquo;t give up until she had.</p><p>They were now halfway through\nproduction, and were taking time off to promote it. They had\ninterviews scheduled for everyday this week, and then they would be\nback to work. Luna had been enjoying the entire process. She\ntreasured each and every moment. She knew that she would one day look\nback on her time filming the movie, and she wanted it to be a good\nmemory.</p><p>She took a look in the full length\nmirror. She was backstage, in a rather large dressing room. Her team\nhad just finished her hair and make-up, and it was almost time for\nthe show. She stared in amazement.</p><p>She could barely recognize the fox that\nstared back at her. Her long brown hair had been artfully pulled\nback. It was done it a low ponytail that had been pulled to her left\nside. Although simple, it looked stunning. Her make-up was exquisite.\nThey had fix it to were her eyes were penetrating, and she looked\nalluring. The rest of her make-up had been kept simple and finished\nwith a soft pink gloss.</p><p>She was wearing a floor length navy\nblue dress. It was silky and hugged her body tightly. It showed off\nher every curve, and it had a long slit that shown off her perfectly\nsmooth legs. She completed the look with a pair of silver stilettos.\nShe had to admit it, she look splendid. Her team had truly outdone\nthemselves.</p><p>There was a hard knock on the door, and\nher assistant poked her head in.</p><p>\u201cLuna! You look absolutely\nincredible! That dress is unreal!\u201d She gushed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt&rsquo;s about that time,\u201d she\ninformed her. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI&rsquo;d be\nalright if I could get my heart to slow down.\u201d She told her\nlaughing a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou&rsquo;ll do great! You always do!\nYou&rsquo;re about to be on though, so you need to get in position.\u201d</p><p>Taking one last look at her reflection,\nshe exited her dressing room. She had been informed that Harry was to\nbe called out first. They wanted her to be as comfortable as\npossible.</p><p>She stood to the side of the stage and\nwaited for her cue. She could see both Harry and James laughing on\nset. She took the time to admire Harry.</p><p>He was dressed in a very elegant navy\nblue suit. The team wanted them to match, and he looked divine. His\nsmile was breathtaking, showing off his perfect dimple. He looked\nrelaxed and radiant. He absentmindedly ran his hands threw his soft\nbrown hair, making her heart stop. She was completely mesmerized. It\nhad to be a crime to look that handsome. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>She was in a bit of a trance, so she\nalmost missed her cue. Vera nudged her in the side. She could hear\nJames introducing her, and both of the men stood up. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>Taking a calming breath, she put on her\nbest smile. Gracefully, she walked onto the stage. She waved to the\ncrowd and even blew a few kisses. Making her way to James first she\ngave him a brief hug. Walking to Harry&rsquo;s side, he pulled her in\nclose. Their hug seem to last forever but was over in just a few\nseconds. She couldn&rsquo;t help the blush that crept up her checks, when\nhe whispered in her ear. \n</p><p><br/></p><p>\u201cYou look lovely!\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bright smile and took\nher place on the seat beside him. It all felt glamorous, and she was\non cloud nine. She was living her dream.</p><p>James cleared his throat, and the crowd\ndied down.</p><p>\u201cLuna, I must say, you look\nabsolutely stunning! Am I right?!\u201d he asked the crowd. The crowd\nroared .</p><p>\u201cOh what can I say? I have an\nincredible team behind me!\u201d She laughed, waving her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s what it is,\u201d\nhe teased. \u201cWell.. As I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all aware <i>The Enchantment&rsquo;s\nTale</i> is one of the most talked about film&rsquo;s of the year! It is highly\nanticipated, and we are counting down the days until it&rsquo;s released.\nWe&rsquo;ve had a chance to talk with Harry about it a bit, so we were just\nwondering.. What are your thoughts on the film Luna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can honestly say that I&rsquo;m beyond\nhonored to be a part of this production. We have an amazing cast and\nI feel like this will definitely be the film to beat.\u201d She told him\nwith a wink.</p><p>Harry nodded his head in agreement, and\nlooked at her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWe&rsquo;ve been given an exclusive first\npeak, so why don&rsquo;t we take a look.\u201d James said excited.</p><p>They all turned as one to the big\nscreen behind them. The scene, of course, was one of there many love\nscenes. Harry had perfectly delivered his lines, and she had been\ncaptivating. The entire scene had been enchanting and left her in\nawe. This was also the first time either her or Harry had viewed the\nscene.</p><p>The kiss at the end of the scene had\nleft her smiling. She could still remember the taste of Harry&rsquo;s lips\non hers and the feel of it when he had softly bit her lip. It left\nher in a daze, and she had to remember where she was. Clearing her\nmind, she turned back to the men.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell.. I have to say, the chemistry\nbetween the two of you is astounding.\u201d James gushed, when it ended.\n\u201cI mean that scene was breathtaking! I have chills!\u201d he told them\nraising his sleeves.</p><p>Luna and Harry were both beaming. They\nthanked him gratefully.</p><p>\u201cSo.. I have to ask.\u201d He said\nturning to them. \u201cAny of that chemistry taking place off screen?\u201d</p><p>Luna blushed. She had known everyone\nwould be asking this same question. After all, people loved gossip.</p><p>Harry chuckled a bit and ran his hands\nthrough his hair. She found he done this when he was nervous.\nGlancing her way, his eyes were dancing with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI&rsquo;m sorry to say but no,\u201d Harry\ninformed James, turning to face him.</p><p>The crowd awed loudly and James rolled\nhis eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s true.\u201d\nhe teased. \u201cYou know you can tell me the truth though! I can keep a\nsecret!\u201d</p><p>They both laughed softly. She shifted\nawkwardly and felt his hand on her back. Unseen to the crowd, he\nrubbed soothing circles into her skin.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately so,\u201d Harry went on.\n\u201cLuna&rsquo;s already taken.\u201d</p><p>The crowd went wild. Some were booing\nand some were cheering.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d James shouted raising\nhis hands to calm the crowd. \u201cYou said unfortunately so?? Does that\nmean you&rsquo;d want something to happen between the two of you?\u201d James\nasked taking them both off guard.</p><p>By this point, Luna&rsquo;s face was bright\nred. She hid it in her hands and shock her head a bit. She had not\nexpected the conversation to take this turn. Harry kept his hand in\nplace, but hesitated.</p><p>Harry had been quiet. Turning her head\nslightly, she glanced at him. He seemed to be contemplating his\nanswer. His face too was a bit red.</p><p>\u201cI think we&rsquo;ve gotten our answer!\u201d\nJames cheered, when Harry remained silent.</p><p>Harry laughed, shaking his head. \u201cI\nmean Luna is an incredible women and extremely talented. I think any\nman would be lucky to have her.\u201d He said sincerely.</p><p>Luna leaned into him and thanked him\nquietly. He smiled at her radiantly.</p>",

Being\nthe lead star in one of the summers most anticipated film, all eyes\nwere on her. She was currently getting ready to promote her film. She\nwas being interviewed by the one and only James Corden on the Late\nLate Show. Her first interview of many.</p><p>She had met James many times before and\nwas very fond of him. He was a great guy, and his show was\noutstanding. She was beyond delighted to be asked to do the show, but\ncouldn\u2019t stop her heart from racing.</p><p>She was still relatively new to the\nscene, so being in the spotlight was a bit nerve wrecking. Knowing\nthis, James assured her he would take it easy on her.</p><p>Harry was also suppose to be making an\nappearance. Harry Styles was playing Jasper Carter, her hot and\nsteamy love interest.</p><p>Luna had met Harry first at auditions.\nHe had left her a little baffled, in the beginning. Of course, she\nhad known who Harry was. Everyone in the world had to have known him\nby now. She had to admit, she was quite a big fan of his. She had\neven seen him in concert, a few months before.</p><p>She had not known what to expect of\nhim. Knowing how big of a star he was, she had assumed he would be a\nbit stuck up. However, he had been quite the opposite. Upon arrival,\nHarry had walked straight up to her. He introduced himself and gave\nher a warm hug. He made sure she had been completely at ease the\nentire day. They ran lines with each other from multiple different\nscenes. Their chemistry had been undeniable, and they left the\ndirectors speechless. They didn\u2019t have to wait long before receiving\nthe call and being offered the part. A few days later, she had\nreceived an enormous bouquet of red roses from Harry congratulating\nher.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>She had been over the moon, when she\nwas told he would be her costar. Knowing he would be with her\nthroughout the entire process, she felt relieved. With it being her\nfirst major film, she had been beyond stressed. She couldn\u2019t help but\nworry she would mess things up.</p><p>It had been her lifelong dream to\nbecome a highly known actress. She wanted to star along side of the\nbiggest named celebrities and wouldn\u2019t give up until she had.</p><p>They were now halfway through\nproduction, and were taking time off to promote it. They had\ninterviews scheduled for everyday this week, and then they would be\nback to work. Luna had been enjoying the entire process. She\ntreasured each and every moment. She knew that she would one day look\nback on her time filming the movie, and she wanted it to be a good\nmemory.</p><p>She took a look in the full length\nmirror. She was backstage, in a rather large dressing room. Her team\nhad just finished her hair and make-up, and it was almost time for\nthe show. She stared in amazement.</p><p>She could barely recognize the fox that\nstared back at her. Her long brown hair had been artfully pulled\nback. It was done it a low ponytail that had been pulled to her left\nside. Although simple, it looked stunning. Her make-up was exquisite.\nThey had fix it to were her eyes were penetrating, and she looked\nalluring. The rest of her make-up had been kept simple and finished\nwith a soft pink gloss.</p><p>She was wearing a floor length navy\nblue dress. It was silky and hugged her body tightly. It showed off\nher every curve, and it had a long slit that shown off her perfectly\nsmooth legs. She completed the look with a pair of silver stilettos.\nShe had to admit it, she look splendid. Her team had truly outdone\nthemselves.</p><p>There was a hard knock on the door, and\nher assistant poked her head in.</p><p>\u201cLuna! You look absolutely\nincredible! That dress is unreal!\u201d She gushed.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Vera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about that time,\u201d she\ninformed her. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d be\nalright if I could get my heart to slow down.\u201d She told her\nlaughing a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great! You always do!\nYou\u2019re about to be on though, so you need to get in position.\u201d</p><p>Taking one last look at her reflection,\nshe exited her dressing room. She had been informed that Harry was to\nbe called out first. They wanted her to be as comfortable as\npossible.</p><p>She stood to the side of the stage and\nwaited for her cue. She could see both Harry and James laughing on\nset. She took the time to admire Harry.</p><p>He was dressed in a very elegant navy\nblue suit. The team wanted them to match, and he looked divine. His\nsmile was breathtaking, showing off his perfect dimple. He looked\nrelaxed and radiant. He absentmindedly ran his hands threw his soft\nbrown hair, making her heart stop. She was completely mesmerized. It\nhad to be a crime to look that handsome. \n</p><p><br></p><p>She was in a bit of a trance, so she\nalmost missed her cue. Vera nudged her in the side. She could hear\nJames introducing her, and both of the men stood up. \n</p><p><br></p><p>Taking a calming breath, she put on her\nbest smile. Gracefully, she walked onto the stage. She waved to the\ncrowd and even blew a few kisses. Making her way to James first she\ngave him a brief hug. Walking to Harry\u2019s side, he pulled her in\nclose. Their hug seem to last forever but was over in just a few\nseconds. She couldn\u2019t help the blush that crept up her checks, when\nhe whispered in her ear. \n</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cYou look lovely!\u201d</p><p>She gave him a bright smile and took\nher place on the seat beside him. It all felt glamorous, and she was\non cloud nine. She was living her dream.</p><p>James cleared his throat, and the crowd\ndied down.</p><p>\u201cLuna, I must say, you look\nabsolutely stunning! Am I right?!\u201d he asked the crowd. The crowd\nroared .</p><p>\u201cOh what can I say? I have an\nincredible team behind me!\u201d She laughed, waving her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what it is,\u201d\nhe teased. \u201cWell.. As I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all aware <i>The Enchantment\u2019s\nTale</i> is one of the most talked about film\u2019s of the year! It is highly\nanticipated, and we are counting down the days until it\u2019s released.\nWe\u2019ve had a chance to talk with Harry about it a bit, so we were just\nwondering.. What are your thoughts on the film Luna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can honestly say that I\u2019m beyond\nhonored to be a part of this production. We have an amazing cast and\nI feel like this will definitely be the film to beat.\u201d She told him\nwith a wink.</p><p>Harry nodded his head in agreement, and\nlooked at her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been given an exclusive first\npeak, so why don\u2019t we take a look.\u201d James said excited.</p><p>They all turned as one to the big\nscreen behind them. The scene, of course, was one of there many love\nscenes. Harry had perfectly delivered his lines, and she had been\ncaptivating. The entire scene had been enchanting and left her in\nawe. This was also the first time either her or Harry had viewed the\nscene.</p><p>The kiss at the end of the scene had\nleft her smiling. She could still remember the taste of Harry\u2019s lips\non hers and the feel of it when he had softly bit her lip. It left\nher in a daze, and she had to remember where she was. Clearing her\nmind, she turned back to the men.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWell.. I have to say, the chemistry\nbetween the two of you is astounding.\u201d James gushed, when it ended.\n\u201cI mean that scene was breathtaking! I have chills!\u201d he told them\nraising his sleeves.</p><p>Luna and Harry were both beaming. They\nthanked him gratefully.</p><p>\u201cSo.. I have to ask.\u201d He said\nturning to them. \u201cAny of that chemistry taking place off screen?\u201d</p><p>Luna blushed. She had known everyone\nwould be asking this same question. After all, people loved gossip.</p><p>Harry chuckled a bit and ran his hands\nthrough his hair. She found he done this when he was nervous.\nGlancing her way, his eyes were dancing with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say but no,\u201d Harry\ninformed James, turning to face him.</p><p>The crowd awed loudly and James rolled\nhis eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah yeah. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true.\u201d\nhe teased. \u201cYou know you can tell me the truth though! I can keep a\nsecret!\u201d</p><p>They both laughed softly. She shifted\nawkwardly and felt his hand on her back. Unseen to the crowd, he\nrubbed soothing circles into her skin.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately so,\u201d Harry went on.\n\u201cLuna\u2019s already taken.\u201d</p><p>The crowd went wild. Some were booing\nand some were cheering.</p><p>\u201cWait, wait!\u201d James shouted raising\nhis hands to calm the crowd. \u201cYou said unfortunately so??
