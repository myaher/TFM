His pack was a large one, and everyone within the pack was very family oriented, sticking close together and looking out for each other. Alaric had one sister, Janice Blacke, who was eight years his senor, and who moved away after their mother died and opened up a little salon. Janice lived her life happily away from everyone while also attempting to remain close to her family through visits and family or pack related events. </p><p>Alaric was initiated into the Jackson pack as a youngster, and he was fiercely proud of being the son of an alpha. It was something that any young wolf would be proud of. However, life went down hill for the young wolf after he was later abjured along with his father for his father\u2019s wrong doing. Joseph was ousted for making war with the apposing pack when his daughter was attacked and nearly killed in the burning of her salon. Janice survived the attack and did her best to defend her father and brother for their defending her, but the rest of the pack wouldn\u2019t hear a word of it. Joseph didn\u2019t seem to care, but this took a major toll on Alaric in his teen years. Once the proud son of an alpha, Alaric had to learn to live without the pack.</p><p>Eventually he began to prefer to live as a lone wolf, and even after the pack came back to offer to let him back in he refused. Alaric began a relationship with a werewolf named Beth Pelt who he had known as a teenager, and the two eventually became engaged. Thinking all was well and good, Alaric continued to live his life as a lone wolf with his mate. However, Beth became addicted to vampire blood, and left Alaric for another werewolf named Jon, who Alaric later discovered was part of the revealing pack that nearly killed his sister.</p><p>In an attempt to save Beth from the life she was choosing he confronted Jon, but Jon wouldn\u2019t let Beth go without a fight. The two fought it out, and it all got out of hand quickly. Beth tried her best to stop them, but before she could get Alaric out of the house Jon pulled out a gun. He missed his chance to shot Alaric and instead got Beth right in the head. Enraged by this, Alaric charged the alpha, knocking him off his feet and onto the ground, strangling Jon with his own bare hands. After realizing what he\u2019d done, Alaric went to his father for help, and the old wolf took the blame for it to make sure his son was not harmed. In the process Joseph was put to death by the pack, torn to pieces and devoured. </p><p>Alaric traveled a lot after his father\u2019s life was taken, and he made sure his sister was taken care of. Janice eventually settled in New Orleans and married, starting a family of her own. The two kept in contact through phone calls as he continued to travel all over. </p><p>Attempting to take his mind off of his loneliness and the guilt of what had happened, he roamed about the US, going from city to city and trying to figure out where he belonged. He started to get comfortable with this new life change, and he was able to see places he\u2019d never would have seen if he\u2019d stayed in Jackson all his life. Despite enjoying his life as a free wolf he had always enjoyed the company of others of his own kind, and soon enough he went searching for pack. </p><p>During a short stay in Salem, Massachusetts Alaric came across a young boy who was being harassed by several other children. Chasing off the other kids he was able to rescue the boy from his abusers. Though he\u2019d never been around other species besides vampires and werewolves Alaric knew very well from scent alone that the youth was different. He didn\u2019t pry, walking the boy home as extra security before leaving him be. </p><p>In a world where nothing else had existed for so long Alaric found a deep seeded interest in the boy and his father\u2019s background. Staying in Salem, Alaric decided to become a mechanic, temporarily putting aside his need to find a pack. Living in the same neighborhood, Alaric eventually met Arundel while the faerie was in need of some help with the car. He mentioned having met the man\u2019s son, and then confronted him about their background. At first Arundel was very wary about sharing this information with the man, but Alaric promised that he was not there to harm them and that it was curiosity that had driven him to ask. </p><p>Eventually the two began to hit it off, and Alaric soon found a friend in the ancient faerie. The two would talk for hours about their species and the uniqueness of them. They chatted about the world, and Alaric found that his curiosity only grew with all this talk. The two years of living in Salem had proved worth it to Alaric, and he enjoyed the close friendship that he had created with the faerie. </p><p>He wanted to work up a trust with the faerie to meet the son he had saved so that he could learn more about the hybrid, but things were cut short. After receiving a desperate call from Arundel that was suddenly cut off the wolf quickly made his way to the house only to find Arundel viciously murdered and the boy missing. </p><p>The scent of vampire was thick in the air and Alaric swore to take revenge upon the vampires for his close friend. Alaric traveled in search of the vampires, but he found himself losing the trail after a good long while. While in a supernatural bar located in New Mexico he over heard a couple speaking about an island that catered to the master species and held exotic creatures upon it.

His pack was a large one, and everyone within the pack was very family oriented, sticking close together and looking out for each other. Alaric had one sister, Janice Blacke, who was eight years his senor, and who moved away after their mother died and opened up a little salon. Janice lived her life happily away from everyone while also attempting to remain close to her family through visits and family or pack related events. </p><p>Alaric was initiated into the Jackson pack as a youngster, and he was fiercely proud of being the son of an alpha. It was something that any young wolf would be proud of. However, life went down hill for the young wolf after he was later abjured along with his father for his father\u2019s wrong doing. Joseph was ousted for making war with the apposing pack when his daughter was attacked and nearly killed in the burning of her salon. Janice survived the attack and did her best to defend her father and brother for their defending her, but the rest of the pack wouldn\u2019t hear a word of it. Joseph didn\u2019t seem to care, but this took a major toll on Alaric in his teen years. Once the proud son of an alpha, Alaric had to learn to live without the pack.</p><p>Eventually he began to prefer to live as a lone wolf, and even after the pack came back to offer to let him back in he refused. Alaric began a relationship with a werewolf named Beth Pelt who he had known as a teenager, and the two eventually became engaged. Thinking all was well and good, Alaric continued to live his life as a lone wolf with his mate. However, Beth became addicted to vampire blood, and left Alaric for another werewolf named Jon, who Alaric later discovered was part of the revealing pack that nearly killed his sister.</p><p>In an attempt to save Beth from the life she was choosing he confronted Jon, but Jon wouldn\u2019t let Beth go without a fight. The two fought it out, and it all got out of hand quickly. Beth tried her best to stop them, but before she could get Alaric out of the house Jon pulled out a gun. He missed his chance to shot Alaric and instead got Beth right in the head. Enraged by this, Alaric charged the alpha, knocking him off his feet and onto the ground, strangling Jon with his own bare hands. After realizing what he\u2019d done, Alaric went to his father for help, and the old wolf took the blame for it to make sure his son was not harmed. In the process Joseph was put to death by the pack, torn to pieces and devoured. </p><p>Alaric traveled a lot after his father\u2019s life was taken, and he made sure his sister was taken care of. Janice eventually settled in New Orleans and married, starting a family of her own. The two kept in contact through phone calls as he continued to travel all over. </p><p>Attempting to take his mind off of his loneliness and the guilt of what had happened, he roamed about the US, going from city to city and trying to figure out where he belonged. He started to get comfortable with this new life change, and he was able to see places he\u2019d never would have seen if he\u2019d stayed in Jackson all his life. Despite enjoying his life as a free wolf he had always enjoyed the company of others of his own kind, and soon enough he went searching for pack. </p><p>During a short stay in Salem, Massachusetts Alaric came across a young boy who was being harassed by several other children. Chasing off the other kids he was able to rescue the boy from his abusers. Though he\u2019d never been around other species besides vampires and werewolves Alaric knew very well from scent alone that the youth was different. He didn\u2019t pry, walking the boy home as extra security before leaving him be. </p><p>In a world where nothing else had existed for so long Alaric found a deep seeded interest in the boy and his father\u2019s background. Staying in Salem, Alaric decided to become a mechanic, temporarily putting aside his need to find a pack. Living in the same neighborhood, Alaric eventually met Arundel while the faerie was in need of some help with the car. He mentioned having met the man\u2019s son, and then confronted him about their background. At first Arundel was very wary about sharing this information with the man, but Alaric promised that he was not there to harm them and that it was curiosity that had driven him to ask. </p><p>Eventually the two began to hit it off, and Alaric soon found a friend in the ancient faerie. The two would talk for hours about their species and the uniqueness of them. They chatted about the world, and Alaric found that his curiosity only grew with all this talk. The two years of living in Salem had proved worth it to Alaric, and he enjoyed the close friendship that he had created with the faerie. </p><p>He wanted to work up a trust with the faerie to meet the son he had saved so that he could learn more about the hybrid, but things were cut short. After receiving a desperate call from Arundel that was suddenly cut off the wolf quickly made his way to the house only to find Arundel viciously murdered and the boy missing. </p><p>The scent of vampire was thick in the air and Alaric swore to take revenge upon the vampires for his close friend. Alaric traveled in search of the vampires, but he found himself losing the trail after a good long while. While in a supernatural bar located in New Mexico he over heard a couple speaking about an island that catered to the master species and held exotic creatures upon it. From there he traveled across the US and found himself taking a trip to visit this island in hopes of maybe catching another lead.</p><p>Personality:</p><p>Alaric is a loyal, respectful and decent man who displays a great sense of compassion for those in trouble. He displays this upon first meeting the hybrid he saves from the horrid beating he was getting. His deep loyalty toward his friends and family is unbreakable. Alaric holds himself high as a werewolf born to an alpha despite the fact that his father lost that position. Unlike many other werewolves, he was also adept at controlling his animalistic nature giving him a cooler exterior than most others of his species. It is something that has always separated him form others. For this reason, he prefers to live apart from werewolves as a lone wolf. </p><p>If those he holds dear to him are hurt he strikes back with a vengeance that can be deadly, even going as far as to killing anyone who would cause them harm. He is a tough man, and he isn\u2019t afraid to stand up for what he believes in. Alaric also holds a rather curious nature to him that has him constantly wanting to know more once the topic is there on his mind. </p><p>Kinks:<br> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u21b3Up to player<br>Hard limits:<br> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u21b3Up to player<br>Connections:</p><p>Eternity Blackharte-Son of his best friend Arundel</p><p>Occupation:<br> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u21b3No occupation at the moment<br>Fortunately for you this character is:<br> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u21b3OPEN</p><p><b><b><i><b>\u03c9</b>elcome to briarrose\u2026</i></b></b></p><p><b><b><i><b><a href=\"http://briarrosenavigation.tumblr.com/\">Navigation </a>|| <a href=\"http://thebriarrosemanor-rp.tumblr.com/bmplot\">Plot </a>|| <a href=\"http://thebriarrosemanor-rp.tumblr.com/charries\">Characters</a> || <a href=\"http://thebriarrosemanor-rp.tumblr.com/speciesmas\">Species</a> || <a href=\"http://thebriarrosemanor-rp.tumblr.com/\">Home</a></b></i></b></b></p></p>",

Dog days of summer are usually defined as the hottest of the year, some define it as lazy days. This year \u2018hottest\u2019 has nothing to do with the outside temp. You meet Chris and Dodger Evans while taking your own dog to the park.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://brieannakeogh.tumblr.com/post/182583614389/dog-days-of-summer-ch-4\">Previous Chapter</a> / <a href=\"https://brieannakeogh.tumblr.com/post/172311440404/master-list\">Master List</a></b></p><p><b>Warnings:</b> Cursing, and fluff</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The smile that Chris had on was big and bright as he cranked his car. He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle thinking about the sound he heard you make through the door. One of the things he really liked about you was that you wore your heart on your sleeve. That you didn\u2019t play games and just told him how you felt, it was refreshing and he hadn\u2019t experienced that in a while. </p><!-- more --><p>He hurried home, taking Dodger for a walk and loading him into the car, ruffling the fur on his head that was poking out between the front seats. \u201cYou wanna go see your buddy Popcorn?\u201d Chris chuckled at the enthusiastic yip Dodger produced. </p><p>You sounded a little breathless as you buzzed him up and in the apartment his eyes went to the changes that had been made in the last twenty minutes or so. Some books straightened, the clothes on the back of a chair removed, and other cleaning had been done. The pillows on the couch fluffed and sitting neatly in strategic positions, instead of just thrown about wherever your dog pawed at them. He couldn\u2019t hide his smirk when he saw you changed clothes too. Comfortable, but cute. </p><p>\u201cHey Dodger!\u201d You busied yourself petting the dog as he tried to lick your face. Pointedly ignoring the man that was attached on the other end of the leash. You half turn away, still not looking at Chris, going for the remote and couch to set up something to watch. </p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Chris asks. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no nothing wrong.\u201d You backup a bit with hands in the air. Your voice getting higher in pitch with each word. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d </p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at you as you finally look up at him, the blood rushing to your face. \u201cOk, well I might be just a wee bit nervous.\u201d You let out a huff and flop onto the couch. \u201cI had gotten use to you in the friend, acquaintance position, never thinking that you actually like me like I did you.\u201d Two beats pass before your register the wide eyes and smirk that Chris sports. You had basically confessed to him your crush and slap a hand over your mouth as he settles into the couch beside you. </p><p>Chuckling he pulls your hand away from your face. \u201cI\u2019ll let you into a secret.\u201d He whispers to you. \u201cI kinda already figured that part out after the first day we met.\u201d </p><p>You release a groan and deflate more into the couch. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly subtle was I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust so you know, it wasn\u2019t just this.\u201d You wave a hand over his body. \u201cThat I was attracted to, just like I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not this.\u201d Another wave but over your body. \u201cThat you\u2019re attracted to. It\u2019s the whole package, especially now that I\u2019ve gotten to know you. Dog included.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give me a complex about my dog, ya know that?\u201d </p><p>You snort at him. Dodger, who has been patiently sitting on the floor, decides now is a good time to crawl on the couch between the two of you, literally butting in. </p><p>The subject is dropped and you turn on the tv, switching to a streaming site so that you both can agree on something to watch. It\u2019s a little awkward at first, especially on your end. You fidget a bit and have trouble relaxing with him so close, even Dodger gets annoyed with you moving about and goes to lay on the floor with Popcorn. </p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Chris has the arm closest to you laying on the back of the couch. </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Knowing what he wants but doubting it all the same. </p><p>He rolls his eyes and chuckles, pulling on your arm lightly to move his way. Tucking you into the crook of his shoulder and wrapping the arm around you own, rubbing his hand in circles on your upper arm. \u201cRelax.\u201d His warm breath on the side of your face tenses you even more, before you get your body under control. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s finnnne.\u2019 Thinking to yourself. \u2018This is totally acceptable. Just relax, breathe. Damn it you forgot to breathe!\u2019 </p><p>After your internal debate you finally get your breathing under control and he doesn\u2019t seem to mind when you relax into him, pressing against his side more. It actually makes him lose some of the tension you didn\u2019t realize he was holding in his own shoulders. That makes you smile, even more so when Dodger decides to jump back on the couch and lays over you legs with his head on your hip. It\u2019s surreal how normal and right it all is. After another episode of the show that is on, you hear a grumble come from the man on your right. </p><p>\u201cGetting hungry?\u201d You giggle at the face he makes. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should have said something. Dodger I gotta get up, your daddy wants food.\u201d Moving him off of your lap you go into the kitchen to pull everything out and start on dinner. </p><p>As you are chopping up the onions and bell pepper you realize Chris is standing to your side. \u201cNeed any help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends, how do you feel about touching raw meat?\u201d </p><p>He gives you smirk that has you narrowing your eyes at him. \u201cMaybe you should handle the meat and I\u2019ll take care of the vegetables.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t say I\u2019m bad at it.\u201d You tell him with a wink. Setting down your knife, you get another cutting board and place it next to the one Chris is at, getting the package of chicken out. Before you sully your hands with chicken juice, you plug your phone up to the stereo and turn on one of your playlists, humming along and bobbing to the beat. </p><p>Before long everything is cut up and you\u2019re both belting along to the likes of Queen and Taylor Swift. The actual cooking doesn\u2019t take long and you leave him in charge of the pan while you get everything needed to fix the fajitas. </p><p>Turning off the music and getting comfortable back on the couch with your plates, the music from the show you were watching filters through the air while you eat. </p><p>\u201cDamn, that was good.\u201d Chris tells you when he\u2019s finished. </p><p>\u201cIt was just a seasoning packet meal. Not some fancy gourmet wonderment.\u201d You roll your eyes, grabbing his plate and taking it into the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cStill good. I don\u2019t get homemade food very often.\u201d He follows you into the kitchen and starts putting away the condiments as you scrub the dirty dishes. </p><p>You eye him for a few seconds to see if there was a double meaning to that line. \u201cAs long as you help, I\u2019ll cook anytime.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo out for lunch, eat in for dinner?\u201d You shrug. \u201cI could be down for that. Just next month I\u2019m going to have to start restricting my food again. I don\u2019t want you to have to come up with separate meals for me.\u201d </p><p>Next month? He\u2019s already thinking about next month? \u201cWe can talk about it when it gets closer to that time. Get me a list of approved foods and such too. Who knows you might figure out you made a horrible mistake and not want to see me anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with most of my ex\u2019s. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out romantically we can still hang out when I\u2019m in town.\u201d He leans against the kitchen table watching you rinse out a pan. </p><p>The snort that leaves you, wasn\u2019t intended to be so loud. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to still be friends. Honestly thought it was a myth, not that there has been many.\u201d </p><p>He walks over and leans a hip on the counter beside you, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cAll bad luck like the other guy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm sort of. You know about the last guy, and it was the same with the guy before that. Than the boyfriend before that was high school so it was just stupid high school drama and then he went off to college in a different state.\u201d You dried your hands off on a kitchen towel as you talked. </p><p>\u201cThree, huh? What a sorted past you got there.\u201d He teased. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I typically hit it for two years then drop them like a hot potato. I gotta keep up my playa image.\u201d Barely able to get the last out without laughing. </p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help himself. The sound of your laughter ringing in his ears and the crinkles at the edges of your eyes as you tried to stop yourself from laughing at your own stupid joke. Before he even knew what he was doing, he leaned down and placed his lips firmly on yours. One hand on your hip and the other on your shoulder he pulled you towards him. After a few heartbeats, he realized that you were stiff in his hands and your lips were not moving against his. Thinking he had made a mistake, he quickly removed himself from you, taking a step back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too fast wasn\u2019t it? I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words filtered through your numb mind, through one ear and out the other, not comprehending what he said. You had been so shocked at the kiss, that before you could even fully enjoy yourself he was pulling away. The second apology that ran past his lips finally stuck in your brain and you were able to grasp that he thought he had made an error, that you weren\u2019t ready. It wasn\u2019t the case at all. You watched as he took another half step back, feet turned to head back into the living room. He didn\u2019t make it an inch before you were back in his path, pressing into his personal space this time. The hand that you had set on his stomach when you had stepped closer, running up to tug at the back of his neck so he would lean down allowing you to kiss him with all the passion that should have been in the previous one if you hadn\u2019t been frozen. </p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate or freeze when you kissed him. His mouth moving against yours and the hand returning to your hip, this time to push your back into the counter, crowding you against it. His tongue swiping against your lip, once, twice, before pulling back, leaving some space between you. </p><p>\u201cI would have to give that a 6 as far as first kisses go.\u201d You joke, trying desperately to regain some semblance of normal breathing, instead of the panting that was trying to come out. </p><p>\u201cJust a 6? I would say at least an 8.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy scale was out of 5.\u201d You wink, not really sure where you were pulling this confidant act from, as currently your legs felt like jello. </p><p>\u201cMine too.\u201d He had a cocky smirk on his face, but you could see his hand twitch a little, like he wanted to reach out to you again. \u201cI should probably get going though. It\u2019s starting to get late.\u201d </p><p>You nod your head, not trusting what would come of your mouth would be an agreement or an offer to stay the night. It was way too soon for that and you were sure that if he didn\u2019t leave now, he wouldn\u2019t. </p><p>Chris turned and walked back into the living room. You couldn\u2019t help but to cock your head to the side to watch his ass move in the jeans he had on. </p><p>Dodger reluctantly let Chris hook the leash back on him and lead him to the door, you following a few steps behind. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d You ask as he opens the door, just a hint of insecurity in your voice. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll text you later too.\u201d He tells you confidently, calming the knot in your stomach, which evaporates completely when he runs a hand over the side of your face, kissing the opposite cheek goodbye. </p><p>His heart stutters again with your answering grin and the subsequent muffled squeal as he presses the call button for the elevator.

That you didn\u2019t play games and just told him how you felt, it was refreshing and he hadn\u2019t experienced that in a while. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He hurried home, taking Dodger for a walk and loading him into the car, ruffling the fur on his head that was poking out between the front seats. \u201cYou wanna go see your buddy Popcorn?\u201d Chris chuckled at the enthusiastic yip Dodger produced. </p><p>You sounded a little breathless as you buzzed him up and in the apartment his eyes went to the changes that had been made in the last twenty minutes or so. Some books straightened, the clothes on the back of a chair removed, and other cleaning had been done. The pillows on the couch fluffed and sitting neatly in strategic positions, instead of just thrown about wherever your dog pawed at them. He couldn\u2019t hide his smirk when he saw you changed clothes too. Comfortable, but cute. </p><p>\u201cHey Dodger!\u201d You busied yourself petting the dog as he tried to lick your face. Pointedly ignoring the man that was attached on the other end of the leash. You half turn away, still not looking at Chris, going for the remote and couch to set up something to watch. </p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Chris asks. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no nothing wrong.\u201d You backup a bit with hands in the air. Your voice getting higher in pitch with each word. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d </p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at you as you finally look up at him, the blood rushing to your face. \u201cOk, well I might be just a wee bit nervous.\u201d You let out a huff and flop onto the couch. \u201cI had gotten use to you in the friend, acquaintance position, never thinking that you actually like me like I did you.\u201d Two beats pass before your register the wide eyes and smirk that Chris sports. You had basically confessed to him your crush and slap a hand over your mouth as he settles into the couch beside you. </p><p>Chuckling he pulls your hand away from your face. \u201cI\u2019ll let you into a secret.\u201d He whispers to you. \u201cI kinda already figured that part out after the first day we met.\u201d </p><p>You release a groan and deflate more into the couch. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly subtle was I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust so you know, it wasn\u2019t just this.\u201d You wave a hand over his body. \u201cThat I was attracted to, just like I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not this.\u201d Another wave but over your body. \u201cThat you\u2019re attracted to. It\u2019s the whole package, especially now that I\u2019ve gotten to know you. Dog included.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give me a complex about my dog, ya know that?\u201d </p><p>You snort at him. Dodger, who has been patiently sitting on the floor, decides now is a good time to crawl on the couch between the two of you, literally butting in. </p><p>The subject is dropped and you turn on the tv, switching to a streaming site so that you both can agree on something to watch. It\u2019s a little awkward at first, especially on your end. You fidget a bit and have trouble relaxing with him so close, even Dodger gets annoyed with you moving about and goes to lay on the floor with Popcorn. </p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Chris has the arm closest to you laying on the back of the couch. </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Knowing what he wants but doubting it all the same. </p><p>He rolls his eyes and chuckles, pulling on your arm lightly to move his way. Tucking you into the crook of his shoulder and wrapping the arm around you own, rubbing his hand in circles on your upper arm. \u201cRelax.\u201d His warm breath on the side of your face tenses you even more, before you get your body under control. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s finnnne.\u2019 Thinking to yourself. \u2018This is totally acceptable. Just relax, breathe. Damn it you forgot to breathe!\u2019 </p><p>After your internal debate you finally get your breathing under control and he doesn\u2019t seem to mind when you relax into him, pressing against his side more. It actually makes him lose some of the tension you didn\u2019t realize he was holding in his own shoulders. That makes you smile, even more so when Dodger decides to jump back on the couch and lays over you legs with his head on your hip. It\u2019s surreal how normal and right it all is. After another episode of the show that is on, you hear a grumble come from the man on your right. </p><p>\u201cGetting hungry?\u201d You giggle at the face he makes. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should have said something. Dodger I gotta get up, your daddy wants food.\u201d Moving him off of your lap you go into the kitchen to pull everything out and start on dinner. </p><p>As you are chopping up the onions and bell pepper you realize Chris is standing to your side. \u201cNeed any help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends, how do you feel about touching raw meat?\u201d </p><p>He gives you smirk that has you narrowing your eyes at him. \u201cMaybe you should handle the meat and I\u2019ll take care of the vegetables.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t say I\u2019m bad at it.\u201d You tell him with a wink. Setting down your knife, you get another cutting board and place it next to the one Chris is at, getting the package of chicken out. Before you sully your hands with chicken juice, you plug your phone up to the stereo and turn on one of your playlists, humming along and bobbing to the beat. </p><p>Before long everything is cut up and you\u2019re both belting along to the likes of Queen and Taylor Swift. The actual cooking doesn\u2019t take long and you leave him in charge of the pan while you get everything needed to fix the fajitas. </p><p>Turning off the music and getting comfortable back on the couch with your plates, the music from the show you were watching filters through the air while you eat. </p><p>\u201cDamn, that was good.\u201d Chris tells you when he\u2019s finished. </p><p>\u201cIt was just a seasoning packet meal. Not some fancy gourmet wonderment.\u201d You roll your eyes, grabbing his plate and taking it into the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cStill good. I don\u2019t get homemade food very often.\u201d He follows you into the kitchen and starts putting away the condiments as you scrub the dirty dishes. </p><p>You eye him for a few seconds to see if there was a double meaning to that line. \u201cAs long as you help, I\u2019ll cook anytime.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo out for lunch, eat in for dinner?\u201d You shrug. \u201cI could be down for that. Just next month I\u2019m going to have to start restricting my food again. I don\u2019t want you to have to come up with separate meals for me.\u201d </p><p>Next month? He\u2019s already thinking about next month? \u201cWe can talk about it when it gets closer to that time. Get me a list of approved foods and such too. Who knows you might figure out you made a horrible mistake and not want to see me anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with most of my ex\u2019s. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out romantically we can still hang out when I\u2019m in town.\u201d He leans against the kitchen table watching you rinse out a pan. </p><p>The snort that leaves you, wasn\u2019t intended to be so loud. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to still be friends. Honestly thought it was a myth, not that there has been many.\u201d </p><p>He walks over and leans a hip on the counter beside you, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cAll bad luck like the other guy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm sort of. You know about the last guy, and it was the same with the guy before that. Than the boyfriend before that was high school so it was just stupid high school drama and then he went off to college in a different state.\u201d You dried your hands off on a kitchen towel as you talked. </p><p>\u201cThree, huh? What a sorted past you got there.\u201d He teased. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I typically hit it for two years then drop them like a hot potato. I gotta keep up my playa image.\u201d Barely able to get the last out without laughing. </p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help himself. The sound of your laughter ringing in his ears and the crinkles at the edges of your eyes as you tried to stop yourself from laughing at your own stupid joke. Before he even knew what he was doing, he leaned down and placed his lips firmly on yours. One hand on your hip and the other on your shoulder he pulled you towards him. After a few heartbeats, he realized that you were stiff in his hands and your lips were not moving against his. Thinking he had made a mistake, he quickly removed himself from you, taking a step back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too fast wasn\u2019t it? I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words filtered through your numb mind, through one ear and out the other, not comprehending what he said. You had been so shocked at the kiss, that before you could even fully enjoy yourself he was pulling away. The second apology that ran past his lips finally stuck in your brain and you were able to grasp that he thought he had made an error, that you weren\u2019t ready. It wasn\u2019t the case at all. You watched as he took another half step back, feet turned to head back into the living room. He didn\u2019t make it an inch before you were back in his path, pressing into his personal space this time. The hand that you had set on his stomach when you had stepped closer, running up to tug at the back of his neck so he would lean down allowing you to kiss him with all the passion that should have been in the previous one if you hadn\u2019t been frozen. </p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate or freeze when you kissed him. His mouth moving against yours and the hand returning to your hip, this time to push your back into the counter, crowding you against it. His tongue swiping against your lip, once, twice, before pulling back, leaving some space between you. </p><p>\u201cI would have to give that a 6 as far as first kisses go.\u201d You joke, trying desperately to regain some semblance of normal breathing, instead of the panting that was trying to come out. </p><p>\u201cJust a 6? I would say at least an 8.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy scale was out of 5.\u201d You wink, not really sure where you were pulling this confidant act from, as currently your legs felt like jello. </p><p>\u201cMine too.\u201d He had a cocky smirk on his face, but you could see his hand twitch a little, like he wanted to reach out to you again. \u201cI should probably get going though. It\u2019s starting to get late.\u201d </p><p>You nod your head, not trusting what would come of your mouth would be an agreement or an offer to stay the night. It was way too soon for that and you were sure that if he didn\u2019t leave now, he wouldn\u2019t. </p><p>Chris turned and walked back into the living room. You couldn\u2019t help but to cock your head to the side to watch his ass move in the jeans he had on. </p><p>Dodger reluctantly let Chris hook the leash back on him and lead him to the door, you following a few steps behind. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d You ask as he opens the door, just a hint of insecurity in your voice. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll text you later too.\u201d He tells you confidently, calming the knot in your stomach, which evaporates completely when he runs a hand over the side of your face, kissing the opposite cheek goodbye. </p><p>His heart stutters again with your answering grin and the subsequent muffled squeal as he presses the call button for the elevator. He thinks he could definitely get use to that happy noise every time he left you. </p><p><b><a href=\"https://brieannakeogh.tumblr.com/post/183253301299/dog-days-of-summer-ch-6\">Next Chapter</a></b></p><p><b>So I was blocked on this chapter a whole lot.

He couldn\u2019t help but chuckle thinking about the sound he heard you make through the door. One of the things he really liked about you was that you wore your heart on your sleeve. That you didn\u2019t play games and just told him how you felt, it was refreshing and he hadn\u2019t experienced that in a while. </p>[[MORE]]<p>He hurried home, taking Dodger for a walk and loading him into the car, ruffling the fur on his head that was poking out between the front seats. \u201cYou wanna go see your buddy Popcorn?\u201d Chris chuckled at the enthusiastic yip Dodger produced. </p><p>You sounded a little breathless as you buzzed him up and in the apartment his eyes went to the changes that had been made in the last twenty minutes or so. Some books straightened, the clothes on the back of a chair removed, and other cleaning had been done. The pillows on the couch fluffed and sitting neatly in strategic positions, instead of just thrown about wherever your dog pawed at them. He couldn\u2019t hide his smirk when he saw you changed clothes too. Comfortable, but cute. </p><p>\u201cHey Dodger!\u201d You busied yourself petting the dog as he tried to lick your face. Pointedly ignoring the man that was attached on the other end of the leash. You half turn away, still not looking at Chris, going for the remote and couch to set up something to watch. </p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d Chris asks. </p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no nothing wrong.\u201d You backup a bit with hands in the air. Your voice getting higher in pitch with each word. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d </p><p>He cocks an eyebrow at you as you finally look up at him, the blood rushing to your face. \u201cOk, well I might be just a wee bit nervous.\u201d You let out a huff and flop onto the couch. \u201cI had gotten use to you in the friend, acquaintance position, never thinking that you actually like me like I did you.\u201d Two beats pass before your register the wide eyes and smirk that Chris sports. You had basically confessed to him your crush and slap a hand over your mouth as he settles into the couch beside you. </p><p>Chuckling he pulls your hand away from your face. \u201cI\u2019ll let you into a secret.\u201d He whispers to you. \u201cI kinda already figured that part out after the first day we met.\u201d </p><p>You release a groan and deflate more into the couch. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly subtle was I?\u201d </p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d </p><p>\u201cJust so you know, it wasn\u2019t just this.\u201d You wave a hand over his body. \u201cThat I was attracted to, just like I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not this.\u201d Another wave but over your body. \u201cThat you\u2019re attracted to. It\u2019s the whole package, especially now that I\u2019ve gotten to know you. Dog included.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to give me a complex about my dog, ya know that?\u201d </p><p>You snort at him. Dodger, who has been patiently sitting on the floor, decides now is a good time to crawl on the couch between the two of you, literally butting in. </p><p>The subject is dropped and you turn on the tv, switching to a streaming site so that you both can agree on something to watch. It\u2019s a little awkward at first, especially on your end. You fidget a bit and have trouble relaxing with him so close, even Dodger gets annoyed with you moving about and goes to lay on the floor with Popcorn. </p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Chris has the arm closest to you laying on the back of the couch. </p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Knowing what he wants but doubting it all the same. </p><p>He rolls his eyes and chuckles, pulling on your arm lightly to move his way. Tucking you into the crook of his shoulder and wrapping the arm around you own, rubbing his hand in circles on your upper arm. \u201cRelax.\u201d His warm breath on the side of your face tenses you even more, before you get your body under control. </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s finnnne.\u2019 Thinking to yourself. \u2018This is totally acceptable. Just relax, breathe. Damn it you forgot to breathe!\u2019 </p><p>After your internal debate you finally get your breathing under control and he doesn\u2019t seem to mind when you relax into him, pressing against his side more. It actually makes him lose some of the tension you didn\u2019t realize he was holding in his own shoulders. That makes you smile, even more so when Dodger decides to jump back on the couch and lays over you legs with his head on your hip. It\u2019s surreal how normal and right it all is. After another episode of the show that is on, you hear a grumble come from the man on your right. </p><p>\u201cGetting hungry?\u201d You giggle at the face he makes. </p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d </p><p>\u201cYou should have said something. Dodger I gotta get up, your daddy wants food.\u201d Moving him off of your lap you go into the kitchen to pull everything out and start on dinner. </p><p>As you are chopping up the onions and bell pepper you realize Chris is standing to your side. \u201cNeed any help?\u201d </p><p>\u201cDepends, how do you feel about touching raw meat?\u201d </p><p>He gives you smirk that has you narrowing your eyes at him. \u201cMaybe you should handle the meat and I\u2019ll take care of the vegetables.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t say I\u2019m bad at it.\u201d You tell him with a wink. Setting down your knife, you get another cutting board and place it next to the one Chris is at, getting the package of chicken out. Before you sully your hands with chicken juice, you plug your phone up to the stereo and turn on one of your playlists, humming along and bobbing to the beat. </p><p>Before long everything is cut up and you\u2019re both belting along to the likes of Queen and Taylor Swift. The actual cooking doesn\u2019t take long and you leave him in charge of the pan while you get everything needed to fix the fajitas. </p><p>Turning off the music and getting comfortable back on the couch with your plates, the music from the show you were watching filters through the air while you eat. </p><p>\u201cDamn, that was good.\u201d Chris tells you when he\u2019s finished. </p><p>\u201cIt was just a seasoning packet meal. Not some fancy gourmet wonderment.\u201d You roll your eyes, grabbing his plate and taking it into the kitchen. </p><p>\u201cStill good. I don\u2019t get homemade food very often.\u201d He follows you into the kitchen and starts putting away the condiments as you scrub the dirty dishes. </p><p>You eye him for a few seconds to see if there was a double meaning to that line. \u201cAs long as you help, I\u2019ll cook anytime.\u201d </p><p>\u201cGo out for lunch, eat in for dinner?\u201d You shrug. \u201cI could be down for that. Just next month I\u2019m going to have to start restricting my food again. I don\u2019t want you to have to come up with separate meals for me.\u201d </p><p>Next month? He\u2019s already thinking about next month? \u201cWe can talk about it when it gets closer to that time. Get me a list of approved foods and such too. Who knows you might figure out you made a horrible mistake and not want to see me anymore.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with most of my ex\u2019s. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out romantically we can still hang out when I\u2019m in town.\u201d He leans against the kitchen table watching you rinse out a pan. </p><p>The snort that leaves you, wasn\u2019t intended to be so loud. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to still be friends. Honestly thought it was a myth, not that there has been many.\u201d </p><p>He walks over and leans a hip on the counter beside you, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cAll bad luck like the other guy?\u201d </p><p>\u201cMmm sort of. You know about the last guy, and it was the same with the guy before that. Than the boyfriend before that was high school so it was just stupid high school drama and then he went off to college in a different state.\u201d You dried your hands off on a kitchen towel as you talked. </p><p>\u201cThree, huh? What a sorted past you got there.\u201d He teased. </p><p>\u201cOh yeah. I typically hit it for two years then drop them like a hot potato. I gotta keep up my playa image.\u201d Barely able to get the last out without laughing. </p><p>Chris couldn\u2019t help himself. The sound of your laughter ringing in his ears and the crinkles at the edges of your eyes as you tried to stop yourself from laughing at your own stupid joke. Before he even knew what he was doing, he leaned down and placed his lips firmly on yours. One hand on your hip and the other on your shoulder he pulled you towards him. After a few heartbeats, he realized that you were stiff in his hands and your lips were not moving against his. Thinking he had made a mistake, he quickly removed himself from you, taking a step back. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That was too fast wasn\u2019t it? I just\u2026\u201d</p><p>His words filtered through your numb mind, through one ear and out the other, not comprehending what he said. You had been so shocked at the kiss, that before you could even fully enjoy yourself he was pulling away. The second apology that ran past his lips finally stuck in your brain and you were able to grasp that he thought he had made an error, that you weren\u2019t ready. It wasn\u2019t the case at all. You watched as he took another half step back, feet turned to head back into the living room. He didn\u2019t make it an inch before you were back in his path, pressing into his personal space this time. The hand that you had set on his stomach when you had stepped closer, running up to tug at the back of his neck so he would lean down allowing you to kiss him with all the passion that should have been in the previous one if you hadn\u2019t been frozen. </p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate or freeze when you kissed him. His mouth moving against yours and the hand returning to your hip, this time to push your back into the counter, crowding you against it. His tongue swiping against your lip, once, twice, before pulling back, leaving some space between you. </p><p>\u201cI would have to give that a 6 as far as first kisses go.\u201d You joke, trying desperately to regain some semblance of normal breathing, instead of the panting that was trying to come out. </p><p>\u201cJust a 6? I would say at least an 8.\u201d </p><p>\u201cMy scale was out of 5.\u201d You wink, not really sure where you were pulling this confidant act from, as currently your legs felt like jello. </p><p>\u201cMine too.\u201d He had a cocky smirk on his face, but you could see his hand twitch a little, like he wanted to reach out to you again. \u201cI should probably get going though. It\u2019s starting to get late.\u201d </p><p>You nod your head, not trusting what would come of your mouth would be an agreement or an offer to stay the night. It was way too soon for that and you were sure that if he didn\u2019t leave now, he wouldn\u2019t. </p><p>Chris turned and walked back into the living room. You couldn\u2019t help but to cock your head to the side to watch his ass move in the jeans he had on. </p><p>Dodger reluctantly let Chris hook the leash back on him and lead him to the door, you following a few steps behind. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d You ask as he opens the door, just a hint of insecurity in your voice. </p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll text you later too.\u201d He tells you confidently, calming the knot in your stomach, which evaporates completely when he runs a hand over the side of your face, kissing the opposite cheek goodbye. </p><p>His heart stutters again with your answering grin and the subsequent muffled squeal as he presses the call button for the elevator. He thinks he could definitely get use to that happy noise every time he left you. </p><p><b><a href=\"https://brieannakeogh.tumblr.com/post/183253301299/dog-days-of-summer-ch-6\">Next Chapter</a></b></p><p><b>So I was blocked on this chapter a whole lot.

The actual cooking doesn&rsquo;t take long and you leave him in charge of the pan while you get everything needed to fix the fajitas. </p><p>Turning off the music and getting comfortable back on the couch with your plates, the music from the show you were watching filters through the air while you eat. </p><p>&ldquo;Damn, that was good.&rdquo; Chris tells you when he&rsquo;s finished. </p><p>&ldquo;It was just a seasoning packet meal. Not some fancy gourmet wonderment.&rdquo; You roll your eyes, grabbing his plate and taking it into the kitchen. </p><p>&ldquo;Still good. I don&rsquo;t get homemade food very often.&rdquo; He follows you into the kitchen and starts putting away the condiments as you scrub the dirty dishes. </p><p>You eye him for a few seconds to see if there was a double meaning to that line. &ldquo;As long as you help, I&rsquo;ll cook anytime.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Go out for lunch, eat in for dinner?&rdquo; You shrug. &ldquo;I could be down for that. Just next month I&rsquo;m going to have to start restricting my food again. I don&rsquo;t want you to have to come up with separate meals for me.&rdquo; </p><p>Next month? He&rsquo;s already thinking about next month? &ldquo;We can talk about it when it gets closer to that time. Get me a list of approved foods and such too. Who knows you might figure out you made a horrible mistake and not want to see me anymore.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m friends with most of my ex&rsquo;s. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t work out romantically we can still hang out when I&rsquo;m in town.&rdquo; He leans against the kitchen table watching you rinse out a pan. </p><p>The snort that leaves you, wasn&rsquo;t intended to be so loud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to still be friends. Honestly thought it was a myth, not that there has been many.&rdquo; </p><p>He walks over and leans a hip on the counter beside you, arms crossed over his chest. &ldquo;All bad luck like the other guy?&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Mmm sort of. You know about the last guy, and it was the same with the guy before that. Than the boyfriend before that was high school so it was just stupid high school drama and then he went off to college in a different state.&rdquo; You dried your hands off on a kitchen towel as you talked. </p><p>&ldquo;Three, huh? What a sorted past you got there.&rdquo; He teased. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. I typically hit it for two years then drop them like a hot potato. I gotta keep up my playa image.&rdquo; Barely able to get the last out without laughing. </p><p>Chris couldn&rsquo;t help himself. The sound of your laughter ringing in his ears and the crinkles at the edges of your eyes as you tried to stop yourself from laughing at your own stupid joke. Before he even knew what he was doing, he leaned down and placed his lips firmly on yours. One hand on your hip and the other on your shoulder he pulled you towards him. After a few heartbeats, he realized that you were stiff in his hands and your lips were not moving against his. Thinking he had made a mistake, he quickly removed himself from you, taking a step back. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. That was too fast wasn&rsquo;t it? I just&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>His words filtered through your numb mind, through one ear and out the other, not comprehending what he said. You had been so shocked at the kiss, that before you could even fully enjoy yourself he was pulling away. The second apology that ran past his lips finally stuck in your brain and you were able to grasp that he thought he had made an error, that you weren&rsquo;t ready. It wasn&rsquo;t the case at all. You watched as he took another half step back, feet turned to head back into the living room. He didn&rsquo;t make it an inch before you were back in his path, pressing into his personal space this time. The hand that you had set on his stomach when you had stepped closer, running up to tug at the back of his neck so he would lean down allowing you to kiss him with all the passion that should have been in the previous one if you hadn&rsquo;t been frozen. </p><p>He didn&rsquo;t hesitate or freeze when you kissed him. His mouth moving against yours and the hand returning to your hip, this time to push your back into the counter, crowding you against it. His tongue swiping against your lip, once, twice, before pulling back, leaving some space between you. </p><p>&ldquo;I would have to give that a 6 as far as first kisses go.&rdquo; You joke, trying desperately to regain some semblance of normal breathing, instead of the panting that was trying to come out. </p><p>&ldquo;Just a 6? I would say at least an 8.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;My scale was out of 5.&rdquo; You wink, not really sure where you were pulling this confidant act from, as currently your legs felt like jello. </p><p>&ldquo;Mine too.&rdquo; He had a cocky smirk on his face, but you could see his hand twitch a little, like he wanted to reach out to you again. &ldquo;I should probably get going though. It&rsquo;s starting to get late.&rdquo; </p><p>You nod your head, not trusting what would come of your mouth would be an agreement or an offer to stay the night. It was way too soon for that and you were sure that if he didn&rsquo;t leave now, he wouldn&rsquo;t. </p><p>Chris turned and walked back into the living room. You couldn&rsquo;t help but to cock your head to the side to watch his ass move in the jeans he had on. </p><p>Dodger reluctantly let Chris hook the leash back on him and lead him to the door, you following a few steps behind. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow?&rdquo; You ask as he opens the door, just a hint of insecurity in your voice. </p><p>&ldquo;Definitely. I&rsquo;ll text you later too.&rdquo; He tells you confidently, calming the knot in your stomach, which evaporates completely when he runs a hand over the side of your face, kissing the opposite cheek goodbye. </p><p>His heart stutters again with your answering grin and the subsequent muffled squeal as he presses the call button for the elevator. He thinks he could definitely get use to that happy noise every time he left you. </p><p><b><a href=\"https://brieannakeogh.tumblr.com/post/183253301299/dog-days-of-summer-ch-6\">Next Chapter</a></b></p><p><b>So I was blocked on this chapter a whole lot.
