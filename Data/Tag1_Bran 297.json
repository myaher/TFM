As the most magically powerful Stark as a skinchanger and greenseer, one would assume he has a pretty large role, and moreover, the story started with him.\u00a0</p><p>In the books, it starts from his POV of observing Ned executing a deserter from the Night\u2019s Watch and stumbling along the six direwolves. On the show, the first episode ends even with his fall that triggers off his magical powers. The episode is titled\u00a0\u201cWinter is coming\u201d. Yes, that is foreshadowing for the war against the Others, but it matters that they are Stark words.\u00a0</p><p>It matters that the books don\u2019t\u00a0start with a Targaryen character\u2019s POV\u00a0and neither is the episode titled something associated it. Bookwise we start with 6 Stark family POVs and with Ned and Catelyn dying, we\u2019re left with 4 Stark POVs (including Jon because he identifies as one of them) that carry through the books.  Four Stark POVs exist in the top 6 characters with highest number of chapters.\u00a0The story started in Winterfell before the characters branch out, get separated and long for their home there. Tyrion gets a POV from book 1, but the other Lannisters Jaime (in book 3) and Cersei\u2019s (in book 4) POVs don&rsquo;t come in until later.\u00a0</p><p>Recently, I read someone say that as much as Jon identifies as a Stark, they don\u2019t think the Starks can save the world. Then why is there so\u00a0so much emphasis on the Starks and Northern mythology, especially bookwise, if it\u2019s just about the Targaryens and them being prophecised heroes who save the day? Why do the words\u00a0\u201cThere must always be a Stark in Winterfell\u201d matter so much then?</p><!-- more --><p>The first Battle for Dawn was won with the help of COTF, giants, the Lost Hero and Bran the Builder. No dragons were involved.\u00a0When this was Osha\u2019s and Old Nan\u2019s response when they saw the red comet:</p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. &ldquo;Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo; When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit than your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;<b>They know truths the grey man has forgotten</b>.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and<b> when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet</b>.&rdquo; - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Though Old Nan did not think so, and she&rsquo;d lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;Dragons,&rdquo; she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>&ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she insisted</b>. - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire and blood and nothing sweet.\u00a0</p><p>It seems rather reductive that Bran, who has \u00a0been growing more powerful, will end up as nothing but a sidekick. Prophecy is a hilt without a sword. Then why are people so sure that the R\u2019hllorists have it right regarding Azor Ahai reborn being a saviour, very well knowing the legend? Why are people so sure that the Prince that was promised is a hero?\u00a0</p><p>Unlike most characters, Bran is one of the few characters who is\u00a0<i>yet</i> to reach his potential with his powers and this is a Chekov\u2019s gun hanging since his fall. He\u2019s been preparing all this while for this moment, but he\u2019s also an underdog when compared to other more action or politically based characters because his visions and journey is confusing. All of this has to lead to something bigger than Jon and Daenerys. Something larger than Targaryens, that goes back to Northern history regarding the Starks long, long before\u00a0Aeon\u2019s Conquest or the Andal Invasion.\u00a0</p><p>This is one of the many reasons why I find @trinuviel\u2019s theory of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168405569689/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai as a destroyer</a>\u00a0(rather than a saviour) theory as a more interesting and probable outcome. There is other basis on this topic regarding the <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">Red Comet</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169117374919/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">True and False Lights</a>. If one doubts GRRM would pull this because \u201cit\u2019s too complicated\u201d,\u00a0Tolkien applied such a prophecy twist in <i>the Hobbit</i> (<a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and as did Tad Williams in <i>Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</i> (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173483245474/trinuviel-stormcloudrising-trinuviel\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>). GRRM has said that both of these authors have influenced his work and especially said about William\u2019s work:\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cFantasy got a bad rep for being formulaic and ritual. And I read The Dragonbone Chair and said, \u2018My God, they can do something with this form, and it\u2019s Tad doing it.\u2019 It\u2019s one of my favourite fantasy series.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a><br/></p></blockquote><p>Is not this very prediction of Jon, Dany and Tyrion as the \u201cthree heads of the dragon\u201d saving the world extremely predictable and ritual? We\u2019ve known that Jon and Dany would be involved in this fight since AGOT since Jon fought a wight and Dany hatched her dragons. What\u2019s so groundbreaking about this? Also why are the actual Starks completely left out of this dynamic? Why doesn\u2019t HOTU have anything on Bran and Arya, who are the two most powerful wargs and skinchangers?\u00a0</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHe sniffed at the drifting smoke. Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin</b>. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and <b>in the sky he saw</b> <b>a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared his teeth</b>, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.\u201d - Bran VII, ACOK<br/></p></blockquote><p>All the Starks (including Jon), especially bookwise, have some trait that acts as a comparative feature that spells them out as foils. Be it, separating magic from political power (Bran, Arya); learning a lesson about dangerous, attractive men and love, the theme of motherhood and using courtesy as a means of diplomacy and PR (Sansa); learning the game of courtly politics (Sansa, Jon and to some extent Arya) or policy work (Jon) and and ruling through love (all of them). Unlike her, all of them spent most of their journey\u2019s learning from mentor figures <i>learning</i> and not being at the top of the social ladder. Not even Jon as Lord Commander. Unlike Arya, who has a Lady Stoneheart figure and the pull of her family to snap her out of her mixing revenge with justice, Dany doesn\u2019t have such a foil, who can act as a mirror to her. Unlike, Jon who did get a loving family and stable (if not perfect) home at Winterfell as a privileged bastard,\u00a0Dany who was on the run with Viserys. She has never had any role models other than Viserys and Drogo, unlike the Starks.\u00a0She went from disempowered to slightly empowered to suddenly overempowered all in the first book and despite blips in her journey she has risen higher than any character. She fixates on the house with the red door, which is long lost and tries to transplant it onto Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and believes she has to carry on Viserys\u2019 legacy but she cannot see home when she finds it (<a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=look+around+you+khaleesi&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=If+I+were+not+the+blood+of+the+dragon%2C+she+thought+wistfully%2C+this+could+be+my+home.&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>). That is her tragedy.\u00a0</p><p>This is one of the reasons, I think Dany, who is associated with pure fire and the House Targaryen words\u00a0\u201cfire and blood\u201d and\u00a0\u201cdragons plant no trees\u201d, may not be the messiah everyone seems to believe - enough to build a cult around her. But this is also why she also may be more suited to be Azor Ahai than Jon, whose assumed foreshadowing only comes in around ADWD, where he dies by the end (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174222531314/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174636037219/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>). This is also why I don&rsquo;t think Jon is meant to be messianic figure as a prophecy hero either, <i>especially</i> <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">because of his resurrection</a>. If we consider there are no subversions coming around the last leg of the story, then we have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2ulhej/a_tale_of_two_liberators_allegory_and_wild/\" target=\"_blank\">Dany as a Moses figure</a> and Jon as Jesus and that is <i>way</i> too Biblical. This is something Tolkien heavily criticised in C.S.Lewis\u2019 Chronicles of Narnia - especially regarding Aslan, who was again basically an allegorical Jesus. So for a person, who is basically writing this series as a response to Tokien, would it make sense for him to go backwards rather than forward? It doesn\u2019t. These are Doylist factors that most of the fandom doesn\u2019t question.\u00a0</p><p>I keep repeating myself whenever I bring up this topic because it basically keeps growing. What will be Jon\u2019s role then, you ask? Maybe R+L=J doesn\u2019t make him more magical. Maybe it affects the politics a lot more considering this is a Chekov\u2019s gun that affects Westeros\u2019 understanding of Robert\u2019s Rebellion and the succession crisis since Robert\u2019s death.  Also why in the world would the writer make R+L=J hang as a\u00a0Damocles\u2019 sword since the beginning for it to be just about giving him more magical blood to die as Jesus? It has more significance than prophecy. It\u2019s to do with identity, politics and history.</p><p>Since GRRM keeps bringing up his issues with Aragorn, Jon is the closest equivalent to him considering the secret parentage reveal. Lo and behold, Aragorn was not tasked to be the messianic hero that ultimately defeated Sauron; it was Frodo. Why in the world would the author make Jon more of a fantasy hero than Aragorn?\u00a0As for Dany, if she does have a tragic fall from grace because of her absolute power resting on dragons and her obsession with the throne believing it to be a way to find home, it would be more akin to Sauruman\u2019s\u00a0or the effect the ring would have on Galadriel. Maybe neither of them are fantasy saviours but rather deconstruction of them. \u00a0</p><p>Neither Jon nor Dany are like Frodo, who is an unlikely hero tasked with the responsibility. An ordinary Hobbit amongst men and Elves. Bran, like Jon or Dany, is \u201cresurrected\u201d by surviving his fall, but unlike Jon and Dany, he ends up a cripple, which limits him far more.\u00a0As per magical powers, he might be on par with Dany, but unlike her his storyline is separate from politics. There is a separation of powers. But in Dany\u2019s case, her political power in many ways stands because of her dragons. Is this not supposed to matter at all? Is it not supposed to matter at all that <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM compared dragons to nuclear power</a>?\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t a character, who has association with trees (which is associated with neither extreme of ice or fire) and the COTF, not have more significance? He\u00a0even shares similarities with the Lost Hero from Old Nan\u2019s tales because he makes a journey to the COTF\u2019s secret cities (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>So why can\u2019t the two Targaryen characters be more of <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/176041001293/anti-saviors\" target=\"_blank\">anti saviours</a> in different ways because of their upbringing, while Bran (and Arya/Nymeria\u2019s pack) have a much larger role of saving people through their powers? GRRM has said over and over that the <a href=\"http://kellyvela.tumblr.com/post/170056085471\" target=\"_blank\">Starks are at the centre of the story, the heart of it</a>. Perhaps, it\u2019s because it\u2019s vaguer with Northern mythology and there are visions more than prophetic words to decipher. But that doesn\u2019t mean these characters don\u2019t have a larger role to play.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps, people might use the excuse that the show has turned Bran robotic since he completely accepted the Three Eyed Raven into his consciousness and they cut the Bloodraven history part out, but I doubt he\u2019s meant to stay possessed until the end. There has to be something that jerks him out of this possessed state - either fear or love. Despite D&amp;D pushing him aside, they still have to reach the same end and plot wise Bran is too important. The story started with him. He was the first to come in touch with his powers. The Chekov\u2019s gun has to go off. There has to be some narrative resolution to Bran\u2019s arc. He didn\u2019t become a cripple and survive for nothing. He\u2019s not meant to be a sidekick given the amount of potential power he holds.\u00a0</p>",

Unlike her, all of them spent most of their journey\u2019s learning from mentor figures <i>learning</i> and not being at the top of the social ladder. Not even Jon as Lord Commander. Unlike Arya, who has a Lady Stoneheart figure and the pull of her family to snap her out of her mixing revenge with justice, Dany doesn\u2019t have such a foil, who can act as a mirror to her. Unlike, Jon who did get a loving family and stable (if not perfect) home at Winterfell as a privileged bastard,\u00a0Dany who was on the run with Viserys. She has never had any role models other than Viserys and Drogo, unlike the Starks.\u00a0She went from disempowered to slightly empowered to suddenly overempowered all in the first book and despite blips in her journey she has risen higher than any character. She fixates on the house with the red door, which is long lost and tries to transplant it onto Dragonstone and King\u2019s Landing and believes she has to carry on Viserys\u2019 legacy but she cannot see home when she finds it (<a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=look+around+you+khaleesi&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=If+I+were+not+the+blood+of+the+dragon%2C+she+thought+wistfully%2C+this+could+be+my+home.&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>). That is her tragedy.\u00a0</p><p>This is one of the reasons, I think Dany, who is associated with pure fire and the House Targaryen words\u00a0\u201cfire and blood\u201d and\u00a0\u201cdragons plant no trees\u201d, may not be the messiah everyone seems to believe - enough to build a cult around her. But this is also why she also may be more suited to be Azor Ahai than Jon, whose assumed foreshadowing only comes in around ADWD, where he dies by the end (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174222531314/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174636037219/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>). This is also why I don\u2019t think Jon is meant to be messianic figure as a prophecy hero either, <i>especially</i> <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">because of his resurrection</a>. If we consider there are no subversions coming around the last leg of the story, then we have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2ulhej/a_tale_of_two_liberators_allegory_and_wild/\" target=\"_blank\">Dany as a Moses figure</a> and Jon as Jesus and that is <i>way</i> too Biblical. This is something Tolkien heavily criticised in C.S.Lewis\u2019 Chronicles of Narnia - especially regarding Aslan, who was again basically an allegorical Jesus. So for a person, who is basically writing this series as a response to Tokien, would it make sense for him to go backwards rather than forward? It doesn\u2019t. These are Doylist factors that most of the fandom doesn\u2019t question.\u00a0</p><p>I keep repeating myself whenever I bring up this topic because it basically keeps growing. What will be Jon\u2019s role then, you ask? Maybe R+L=J doesn\u2019t make him more magical. Maybe it affects the politics a lot more considering this is a Chekov\u2019s gun that affects Westeros\u2019 understanding of Robert\u2019s Rebellion and the succession crisis since Robert\u2019s death.  Also why in the world would the writer make R+L=J hang as a\u00a0Damocles\u2019 sword since the beginning for it to be just about giving him more magical blood to die as Jesus? It has more significance than prophecy. It\u2019s to do with identity, politics and history.</p><p>Since GRRM keeps bringing up his issues with Aragorn, Jon is the closest equivalent to him considering the secret parentage reveal. Lo and behold, Aragorn was not tasked to be the messianic hero that ultimately defeated Sauron; it was Frodo. Why in the world would the author make Jon more of a fantasy hero than Aragorn?\u00a0As for Dany, if she does have a tragic fall from grace because of her absolute power resting on dragons and her obsession with the throne believing it to be a way to find home, it would be more akin to Sauruman\u2019s\u00a0or the effect the ring would have on Galadriel. Maybe neither of them are fantasy saviours but rather deconstruction of them. \u00a0</p><p>Neither Jon nor Dany are like Frodo, who is an unlikely hero tasked with the responsibility. An ordinary Hobbit amongst men and Elves. Bran, like Jon or Dany, is \u201cresurrected\u201d by surviving his fall, but unlike Jon and Dany, he ends up a cripple, which limits him far more.\u00a0As per magical powers, he might be on par with Dany, but unlike her his storyline is separate from politics. There is a separation of powers. But in Dany\u2019s case, her political power in many ways stands because of her dragons. Is this not supposed to matter at all? Is it not supposed to matter at all that <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM compared dragons to nuclear power</a>?\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t a character, who has association with trees (which is associated with neither extreme of ice or fire) and the COTF, not have more significance? He\u00a0even shares similarities with the Lost Hero from Old Nan\u2019s tales because he makes a journey to the COTF\u2019s secret cities (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>So why can\u2019t the two Targaryen characters be more of <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/176041001293/anti-saviors\" target=\"_blank\">anti saviours</a> in different ways because of their upbringing, while Bran (and Arya/Nymeria\u2019s pack) have a much larger role of saving people through their powers? GRRM has said over and over that the <a href=\"http://kellyvela.tumblr.com/post/170056085471\" target=\"_blank\">Starks are at the centre of the story, the heart of it</a>. Perhaps, it\u2019s because it\u2019s vaguer with Northern mythology and there are visions more than prophetic words to decipher. But that doesn\u2019t mean these characters don\u2019t have a larger role to play.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps, people might use the excuse that the show has turned Bran robotic since he completely accepted the Three Eyed Raven into his consciousness and they cut the Bloodraven history part out, but I doubt he\u2019s meant to stay possessed until the end. There has to be something that jerks him out of this possessed state - either fear or love. Despite D&amp;D pushing him aside, they still have to reach the same end and plot wise Bran is too important. The story started with him. He was the first to come in touch with his powers. The Chekov\u2019s gun has to go off. There has to be some narrative resolution to Bran\u2019s arc. He didn\u2019t become a cripple and survive for nothing. He\u2019s not meant to be a sidekick given the amount of potential power he holds.\u00a0</p></p>",

But this is also why she also may be more suited to be Azor Ahai than Jon, whose assumed foreshadowing only comes in around ADWD, where he dies by the end (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173833000269/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174222531314/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/174636037219/why-daenerys-targaryen-is-azor-ahai-come-again\" target=\"_blank\">3</a>). This is also why I don\u2019t think Jon is meant to be messianic figure as a prophecy hero either, <i>especially</i> <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/173274672792/the-resurrection-problem\" target=\"_blank\">because of his resurrection</a>. If we consider there are no subversions coming around the last leg of the story, then we have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2ulhej/a_tale_of_two_liberators_allegory_and_wild/\" target=\"_blank\">Dany as a Moses figure</a> and Jon as Jesus and that is <i>way</i> too Biblical. This is something Tolkien heavily criticised in C.S.Lewis\u2019 Chronicles of Narnia - especially regarding Aslan, who was again basically an allegorical Jesus. So for a person, who is basically writing this series as a response to Tokien, would it make sense for him to go backwards rather than forward? It doesn\u2019t. These are Doylist factors that most of the fandom doesn\u2019t question.\u00a0</p><p>I keep repeating myself whenever I bring up this topic because it basically keeps growing. What will be Jon\u2019s role then, you ask? Maybe R+L=J doesn\u2019t make him more magical. Maybe it affects the politics a lot more considering this is a Chekov\u2019s gun that affects Westeros\u2019 understanding of Robert\u2019s Rebellion and the succession crisis since Robert\u2019s death.  Also why in the world would the writer make R+L=J hang as a\u00a0Damocles\u2019 sword since the beginning for it to be just about giving him more magical blood to die as Jesus? It has more significance than prophecy. It\u2019s to do with identity, politics and history.</p><p>Since GRRM keeps bringing up his issues with Aragorn, Jon is the closest equivalent to him considering the secret parentage reveal. Lo and behold, Aragorn was not tasked to be the messianic hero that ultimately defeated Sauron; it was Frodo. Why in the world would the author make Jon more of a fantasy hero than Aragorn?\u00a0As for Dany, if she does have a tragic fall from grace because of her absolute power resting on dragons and her obsession with the throne believing it to be a way to find home, it would be more akin to Sauruman\u2019s\u00a0or the effect the ring would have on Galadriel. Maybe neither of them are fantasy saviours but rather deconstruction of them. \u00a0</p><p>Neither Jon nor Dany are like Frodo, who is an unlikely hero tasked with the responsibility. An ordinary Hobbit amongst men and Elves. Bran, like Jon or Dany, is \u201cresurrected\u201d by surviving his fall, but unlike Jon and Dany, he ends up a cripple, which limits him far more.\u00a0As per magical powers, he might be on par with Dany, but unlike her his storyline is separate from politics. There is a separation of powers. But in Dany\u2019s case, her political power in many ways stands because of her dragons. Is this not supposed to matter at all? Is it not supposed to matter at all that <a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/2014/06/game-of-thrones-the-dragons-and-nuclear-weapons-nexus/\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM compared dragons to nuclear power</a>?\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t a character, who has association with trees (which is associated with neither extreme of ice or fire) and the COTF, not have more significance? He\u00a0even shares similarities with the Lost Hero from Old Nan\u2019s tales because he makes a journey to the COTF\u2019s secret cities (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173271319764/the-long-night-myth-and-mystery\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>).\u00a0</p><p>So why can\u2019t the two Targaryen characters be more of <a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/176041001293/anti-saviors\" target=\"_blank\">anti saviours</a> in different ways because of their upbringing, while Bran (and Arya/Nymeria\u2019s pack) have a much larger role of saving people through their powers? GRRM has said over and over that the <a href=\"http://kellyvela.tumblr.com/post/170056085471\" target=\"_blank\">Starks are at the centre of the story, the heart of it</a>. Perhaps, it\u2019s because it\u2019s vaguer with Northern mythology and there are visions more than prophetic words to decipher. But that doesn\u2019t mean these characters don\u2019t have a larger role to play.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps, people might use the excuse that the show has turned Bran robotic since he completely accepted the Three Eyed Raven into his consciousness and they cut the Bloodraven history part out, but I doubt he\u2019s meant to stay possessed until the end. There has to be something that jerks him out of this possessed state - either fear or love. Despite D&amp;D pushing him aside, they still have to reach the same end and plot wise Bran is too important. The story started with him. He was the first to come in touch with his powers. The Chekov\u2019s gun has to go off. There has to be some narrative resolution to Bran\u2019s arc. He didn\u2019t become a cripple and survive for nothing. He\u2019s not meant to be a sidekick given the amount of potential power he holds.\u00a0</p></p>",

As the most magically powerful Stark as a skinchanger and greenseer, one would assume he has a pretty large role, and moreover, the story started with him.&nbsp;</p><p>In the books, it starts from his POV of observing Ned executing a deserter from the Night&rsquo;s Watch and stumbling along the six direwolves. On the show, the first episode ends even with his fall that triggers off his magical powers. The episode is titled&nbsp;&ldquo;Winter is coming&rdquo;. Yes, that is foreshadowing for the war against the Others, but it matters that they are Stark words.&nbsp;</p><p>It matters that the books don&rsquo;t&nbsp;start with a Targaryen character&rsquo;s POV&nbsp;and neither is the episode titled something associated it. Bookwise we start with 6 Stark family POVs and with Ned and Catelyn dying, we&rsquo;re left with 4 Stark POVs (including Jon because he identifies as one of them) that carry through the books.  Four Stark POVs exist in the top 6 characters with highest number of chapters.&nbsp;The story started in Winterfell before the characters branch out, get separated and long for their home there. Tyrion gets a POV from book 1, but the other Lannisters Jaime (in book 3) and Cersei&rsquo;s (in book 4) POVs don&rsquo;t come in until later.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I read someone say that as much as Jon identifies as a Stark, they don&rsquo;t think the Starks can save the world. Then why is there so&nbsp;so much emphasis on the Starks and Northern mythology, especially bookwise, if it&rsquo;s just about the Targaryens and them being prophecised heroes who save the day? Why do the words&nbsp;&ldquo;There must always be a Stark in Winterfell&rdquo; matter so much then?</p><p>The first Battle for Dawn was won with the help of COTF, giants, the Lost Hero and Bran the Builder. No dragons were involved.&nbsp;When this was Osha&rsquo;s and Old Nan&rsquo;s response when they saw the red comet:</p><blockquote><p>Maester Luwin did not think so. &ldquo;Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon.&rdquo; When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. &ldquo;Your wolves have more wit than your maester,&rdquo; the wildling woman said. &ldquo;<b>They know truths the grey man has forgotten</b>.&rdquo; The way she said it made him shiver, and<b> when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, &ldquo;Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet</b>.&rdquo; - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Though Old Nan did not think so, and she&rsquo;d lived longer than any of them. &ldquo;Dragons,&rdquo; she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. <b>&ldquo;It be dragons, boy,&rdquo; she insisted</b>. - Bran I, ACOK</p></blockquote><p>Fire and blood and nothing sweet.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems rather reductive that Bran, who has &nbsp;been growing more powerful, will end up as nothing but a sidekick. Prophecy is a hilt without a sword. Then why are people so sure that the R&rsquo;hllorists have it right regarding Azor Ahai reborn being a saviour, very well knowing the legend? Why are people so sure that the Prince that was promised is a hero?&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike most characters, Bran is one of the few characters who is&nbsp;<i>yet</i> to reach his potential with his powers and this is a Chekov&rsquo;s gun hanging since his fall. He&rsquo;s been preparing all this while for this moment, but he&rsquo;s also an underdog when compared to other more action or politically based characters because his visions and journey is confusing. All of this has to lead to something bigger than Jon and Daenerys. Something larger than Targaryens, that goes back to Northern history regarding the Starks long, long before&nbsp;Aeon&rsquo;s Conquest or the Andal Invasion.&nbsp;</p><p>This is one of the many reasons why I find @trinuviel&rsquo;s theory of <a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/168405569689/azor-ahai-the-prince-that-was-promised-and-the\" target=\"_blank\">Azor Ahai as a destroyer</a>&nbsp;(rather than a saviour) theory as a more interesting and probable outcome. There is other basis on this topic regarding the <a href=\"http://lostlittlesatellites.tumblr.com/post/175207606167/the-red-comet\" target=\"_blank\">Red Comet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/169117374919/crowned-with-fire-true-and-false-lights-in-a\" target=\"_blank\">True and False Lights</a>. If one doubts GRRM would pull this because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too complicated&rdquo;,&nbsp;Tolkien applied such a prophecy twist in <i>the Hobbit</i> (<a href=\"http://shinynewrevulsions.tumblr.com/post/175569556368/the-azor-ahaismaug-connection\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>) and as did Tad Williams in <i>Memory, Sorrow, Thorn</i> (<a href=\"https://trinuviel.tumblr.com/post/173483245474/trinuviel-stormcloudrising-trinuviel\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>). GRRM has said that both of these authors have influenced his work and especially said about William&rsquo;s work:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fantasy got a bad rep for being formulaic and ritual. And I read The Dragonbone Chair and said, &lsquo;My God, they can do something with this form, and it&rsquo;s Tad doing it.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s one of my favourite fantasy series.&rdquo; - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/17/tropes-trolls-and-trump-meet-one-of-george-rr-martins-favourite-fantasy-writers-tad-williams\" target=\"_blank\">GRRM</a><br /></p></blockquote><p>Is not this very prediction of Jon, Dany and Tyrion as the &ldquo;three heads of the dragon&rdquo; saving the world extremely predictable and ritual? We&rsquo;ve known that Jon and Dany would be involved in this fight since AGOT since Jon fought a wight and Dany hatched her dragons. What&rsquo;s so groundbreaking about this? Also why are the actual Starks completely left out of this dynamic? Why doesn&rsquo;t HOTU have anything on Bran and Arya, who are the two most powerful wargs and skinchangers?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He sniffed at the drifting smoke. Men, many men, many horses, and <b>fire, fire, fire. No smell was more dangerous, not even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin</b>. The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and <b>in the sky he saw</b> <b>a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared his teeth</b>, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the stars.&rdquo; - Bran VII, ACOK<br /></p></blockquote><p>All the Starks (including Jon), especially bookwise, have some trait that acts as a comparative feature that spells them out as foils. Be it, separating magic from political power (Bran, Arya); learning a lesson about dangerous, attractive men and love, the theme of motherhood and using courtesy as a means of diplomacy and PR (Sansa); learning the game of courtly politics (Sansa, Jon and to some extent Arya) or policy work (Jon) and and ruling through love (all of them). Unlike her, all of them spent most of their journey&rsquo;s learning from mentor figures <i>learning</i> and not being at the top of the social ladder. Not even Jon as Lord Commander. Unlike Arya, who has a Lady Stoneheart figure and the pull of her family to snap her out of her mixing revenge with justice, Dany doesn&rsquo;t have such a foil, who can act as a mirror to her. Unlike, Jon who did get a loving family and stable (if not perfect) home at Winterfell as a privileged bastard,&nbsp;Dany who was on the run with Viserys. She has never had any role models other than Viserys and Drogo, unlike the Starks.&nbsp;She went from disempowered to slightly empowered to suddenly overempowered all in the first book and despite blips in her journey she has risen higher than any character. She fixates on the house with the red door, which is long lost and tries to transplant it onto Dragonstone and King&rsquo;s Landing and believes she has to carry on Viserys&rsquo; legacy but she cannot see home when she finds it (<a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=look+around+you+khaleesi&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>, <a href=\"https://asearchoficeandfire.com/?q=If+I+were+not+the+blood+of+the+dragon%2C+she+thought+wistfully%2C+this+could+be+my+home.&amp;scope%5B%5D=agot&amp;povs%5B%5D=Daenerys\" target=\"_blank\">x</a>).

You then turned to watch your \u2018brothers\u2019 as they followed, basically being carried by the servants. Your gripped tightened around the Hound&rsquo;s hand as he helped you down the uneven dirt street. You were young, only 10 but not stupid. </p><p>You understood that your father was the King but your mother was not the queen, which made you a bastard. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you whispered up toward the hound, your long gown dragging in the street, accumulating slight bits of snow as you moved. </p><p>The large man hummed, keeping his answer sort and sweet as he glanced down at you. He knew how improper it was to address you but he didn&rsquo;t mind. Anyone who cared to question it could burn in hell. </p><p>\u201cThe Stark home\u201d He whispered back, lifting you onto his shoulders, saving your gown from the harsh conditions. The last thing he needed was for your silks to be ruined on top of everything else. </p><p>When you finally got to the square, you saw all of the Starks lined up and waiting for your fathers word.</p><p>Each person in the crowd held their breath as he surveyed each face in turn until, all at once, it was over. </p><p> \u201cMy son for your daughter\u201d He said simply gesturing to a red headed girl and Eddard Stark nods, shaking hands with your father before he sees a small boy from behind the oldest Stark. </p><p>Everyone had been waiting for that. It was only expected that Sansa wed Joffrey and brought together the two kingdoms but something stronger than that, was a son of the north. </p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert asks holding a hand out to the boy, who looked around your age, who stepped forward, away from Eddard and toward your father&rsquo;s outstretched hand. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bran Stark\u201d he mutters nervously causing my father to smile. \u201cThis one shall marry my youngest\u201d Robert bellows, turning quickly to gesture to you. </p><p>You weren&rsquo;t sure how to react, not used to being in the spotlight. Even so, you waved to the little dark haired Lord. You were now betrothed to Brandon Stark, the only trouble was you didn&rsquo;t realize it. </p><p>\u201cHound, put down the girl\u201d My father commands, his voice commanding but kind toward you. Sandor did as his king ordered, setting you down next to the boy, though he could feel your hesitance radiating off of your flesh. </p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for curtain collateral to be put in place when deals were made, and this was no exception. You&rsquo;re father wanted to make sure that your wedding would go off without a hitch and it wouldn&rsquo;t work if they just shipped you off to Winterfell on your birthday&hellip;so he made a choice. </p><p>\u201cShe will stay here, in Westeros with you until they come of age\u201d My father requests before turning and walking away.</p><p>That was all that was said, and there was no going back on the deal that had been made in the eyes of the seven. </p><p>You turned to follow your family but was held in place by the Hound. \u201cHound, what is happening, why can&rsquo;t I come with you?\u201d you asked, fear setting in now \u201cYou will stay here, little bird\u201d He says, reluctantly turning and leaving me there as well. </p><p>Your family was gone before you knew what had happened, you were left alone with the Starks now.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cFollow me dear\u201d a lady you recognized as Catelyn Stark suggested, holding a hand out to you, which you politely refused. </p><p>\u201cI will wait here, for the Hound thank you\u201d you informed, earning an earnest smile from the red haired woman. She too had left her home for marriage, and if anyone in this whole frozen land understood what you were going through, it was her. \u201cTake your time\u201d she allowed simply, turning to leave me. </p><p>You sat for hours on end, without moving from your spot. That is until the small boy they called Bran came to sit aside you.</p><p> \u201cAre you coming in for supper?\u201d Bran asks, his voice breaking through the darkness as he searched your face for any cues. You scoffed at his crude suggestion &ldquo;I have to wait for my family&rdquo; You didn&rsquo;t hardly get the words out before Bran laughed at you, &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t coming you know?&rdquo; he hummed, curious if you understood that they&rsquo;d left you here for real. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they leave me?\u201d you ask but he shrugs \u201call I know is that if you don&rsquo;t come inside you&rsquo;ll freeze\u201d he says wrapping a fur shawl around your soft arms. You weren&rsquo;t going to lie, you were cold but still you shielded away from his touch. </p><p>&ldquo;Come&rdquo; he groaned, not believing your stubbornness. He reached down to take your cold hands in his own which he used to lift you up from the ground. You didn&rsquo;t want to follow his suggestion, but weren&rsquo;t given much of a choice as he lead you inside what you assumed was his home. </p><p>Robb was the first to speak upon seeing you, holding Bran&rsquo;s small hand. \u00a0\u201cYou brought her inside\u201d Robb shouts as your enter the hall, clearly amused. He, unlike you, understood what was going on. \u00a0\u201cI was beginning to think the little one would get frost bite\u201d Jon joked, joining in on the fun. </p><p>\u201cKeep her warm, we wouldn&rsquo;t want your betrothed dead before night fall\u201d Catelyn whispers, careful to keep her voice low enough, and \u00a0just out of range so that you wouldn&rsquo;t hear. Bran nodded, pulling you to the back of the hut by the fire. He held you tightly to his chest, It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily romantic but it kept you warm and you would never forget the kindness you got from Bran on this day. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The next morning you sat outside with the gorgeous lady Sansa and her younger sister Arya, who you didn&rsquo;t know to well yet but liked all the same. She didn&rsquo;t carry herself in the way any other woman did, and you enjoyed that spiteful passion. <br/></p><p> You poised the needle into the fabric and outlined a pattern. You weren&rsquo;t too good at it yet but you were trying your best. You continued your tireless work until you heard a simple noise, and turned to see Bran leaning against the wall, his eyes locked on your frame. </p><p>You waved in his direction, and he only smiled at you in reply. &ldquo;He likes you, you know? Bran&rdquo; Sansa asked, instantly catching your attention. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; You ask, still looking at her as if she&rsquo;d sprouted a second head. &ldquo;He fancies you silly&rdquo; Arya groaned, making you brush harshly, looking down at your face. </p><p>At her words, you couldn&rsquo;t help but glance up, hoping to see the little, dark haired boy you had come to have so. You saw only the jarred cobblestone, no Bran to be found. </p><p>After excusing yourself, you headed toward the house. As soon as your small hand fell on the knob, you heard a faint noise and turned your head up. </p><p>Above you was Bran Stark, sitting atop a building, and you nearly fell in surprise. &ldquo;What are you doing Bran?&rdquo; you squealed, but he put his finger to his lips, trying to encourage your silence. Slowly he offered a hand to you which you took hesitantly, allowing him to lift you onto the ledge he was perched on. </p><p>You held to the cobblestone almost as hard as you were holding Bran\u2019s wrist. </p><p> He shifted your weight into him further, gripping your waist before leading your hands to the frigid wall \u201cHold on, I wont let you fall\u201d Bran suggested, not fazing you for a minute. \u201cPromise?\u201dyou wondered, your voice shaking and he nods \u201cPromise\u201d he swears moving a bit away from you.</p><p>Bran took a hand from you and moved up the wall, only stopping a few feet away to look down at you. It was clear he was expecting you to join him but it was hard with so much fear clouding your judgement. If only your father could see you now. </p><p>You hurried to join him, spite driving you now. Once you got there, you were at a loss for words, it was beautiful. &ldquo;Wow&rdquo; was all you could say, taking in the expanse of the north, all dressed in white. Bran looked up at you from where he was resting, curious as to what got such a reaction out of you. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, instantly earning a gesture from you out into the air. </p><p>&ldquo;All this, every day of your life&rdquo; you urged, not understanding how he was so casual about so much beauty. You were in awe of the snow and large mountains, unlike you ever had before. </p><p>\u201cIt is gorgeous\u201d you added and he smirks \u201cprobably not as gorgeous as Kings Landing though\u201d Bran&rsquo;s tone irritated you, he always talked about Kings Landing as if it was so great, if only he knew. \u201cKings landing is not as great as it seems Bran\u201d you reminded, following him down the scaffolding, until your feet were safely on the ground again. </p>",

You then turned to watch your \u2018brothers\u2019 as they followed, basically being carried by the servants. Your gripped tightened around the Hound\u2019s hand as he helped you down the uneven dirt street. You were young, only 10 but not stupid. </p><p>You understood that your father was the King but your mother was not the queen, which made you a bastard. </p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you whispered up toward the hound, your long gown dragging in the street, accumulating slight bits of snow as you moved. </p><p>The large man hummed, keeping his answer sort and sweet as he glanced down at you. He knew how improper it was to address you but he didn\u2019t mind. Anyone who cared to question it could burn in hell. </p><p>\u201cThe Stark home\u201d He whispered back, lifting you onto his shoulders, saving your gown from the harsh conditions. The last thing he needed was for your silks to be ruined on top of everything else. </p><p>When you finally got to the square, you saw all of the Starks lined up and waiting for your fathers word.</p><p>Each person in the crowd held their breath as he surveyed each face in turn until, all at once, it was over. </p><p> \u201cMy son for your daughter\u201d He said simply gesturing to a red headed girl and Eddard Stark nods, shaking hands with your father before he sees a small boy from behind the oldest Stark. </p><p>Everyone had been waiting for that. It was only expected that Sansa wed Joffrey and brought together the two kingdoms but something stronger than that, was a son of the north. </p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert asks holding a hand out to the boy, who looked around your age, who stepped forward, away from Eddard and toward your father\u2019s outstretched hand. </p><p>\u201cMy name is Bran Stark\u201d he mutters nervously causing my father to smile. \u201cThis one shall marry my youngest\u201d Robert bellows, turning quickly to gesture to you. </p><p>You weren\u2019t sure how to react, not used to being in the spotlight. Even so, you waved to the little dark haired Lord. You were now betrothed to Brandon Stark, the only trouble was you didn\u2019t realize it. </p><p>\u201cHound, put down the girl\u201d My father commands, his voice commanding but kind toward you. Sandor did as his king ordered, setting you down next to the boy, though he could feel your hesitance radiating off of your flesh. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t uncommon for curtain collateral to be put in place when deals were made, and this was no exception. You\u2019re father wanted to make sure that your wedding would go off without a hitch and it wouldn\u2019t work if they just shipped you off to Winterfell on your birthday\u2026so he made a choice. </p><p>\u201cShe will stay here, in Westeros with you until they come of age\u201d My father requests before turning and walking away.</p><p>That was all that was said, and there was no going back on the deal that had been made in the eyes of the seven. </p><p>You turned to follow your family but was held in place by the Hound. \u201cHound, what is happening, why can\u2019t I come with you?\u201d you asked, fear setting in now \u201cYou will stay here, little bird\u201d He says, reluctantly turning and leaving me there as well. </p><p>Your family was gone before you knew what had happened, you were left alone with the Starks now.</p><p>-</p><p>\u201cFollow me dear\u201d a lady you recognized as Catelyn Stark suggested, holding a hand out to you, which you politely refused. </p><p>\u201cI will wait here, for the Hound thank you\u201d you informed, earning an earnest smile from the red haired woman. She too had left her home for marriage, and if anyone in this whole frozen land understood what you were going through, it was her. \u201cTake your time\u201d she allowed simply, turning to leave me. </p><p>You sat for hours on end, without moving from your spot. That is until the small boy they called Bran came to sit aside you.</p><p> \u201cAre you coming in for supper?\u201d Bran asks, his voice breaking through the darkness as he searched your face for any cues. You scoffed at his crude suggestion \u201cI have to wait for my family\u201d You didn\u2019t hardly get the words out before Bran laughed at you, \u201cThey aren\u2019t coming you know?\u201d he hummed, curious if you understood that they\u2019d left you here for real. </p><p>\u201cWhy would they leave me?\u201d you ask but he shrugs \u201call I know is that if you don\u2019t come inside you\u2019ll freeze\u201d he says wrapping a fur shawl around your soft arms. You weren\u2019t going to lie, you were cold but still you shielded away from his touch. </p><p>\u201cCome\u201d he groaned, not believing your stubbornness. He reached down to take your cold hands in his own which he used to lift you up from the ground. You didn\u2019t want to follow his suggestion, but weren\u2019t given much of a choice as he lead you inside what you assumed was his home. </p><p>Robb was the first to speak upon seeing you, holding Bran\u2019s small hand. \u00a0\u201cYou brought her inside\u201d Robb shouts as your enter the hall, clearly amused. He, unlike you, understood what was going on. \u00a0\u201cI was beginning to think the little one would get frost bite\u201d Jon joked, joining in on the fun. </p><p>\u201cKeep her warm, we wouldn\u2019t want your betrothed dead before night fall\u201d Catelyn whispers, careful to keep her voice low enough, and \u00a0just out of range so that you wouldn\u2019t hear. Bran nodded, pulling you to the back of the hut by the fire. He held you tightly to his chest, It wasn\u2019t necessarily romantic but it kept you warm and you would never forget the kindness you got from Bran on this day. \u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The next morning you sat outside with the gorgeous lady Sansa and her younger sister Arya, who you didn\u2019t know to well yet but liked all the same. She didn\u2019t carry herself in the way any other woman did, and you enjoyed that spiteful passion. <br></p><p> You poised the needle into the fabric and outlined a pattern. You weren\u2019t too good at it yet but you were trying your best. You continued your tireless work until you heard a simple noise, and turned to see Bran leaning against the wall, his eyes locked on your frame. </p><p>You waved in his direction, and he only smiled at you in reply. \u201cHe likes you, you know? Bran\u201d Sansa asked, instantly catching your attention. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You ask, still looking at her as if she\u2019d sprouted a second head. \u201cHe fancies you silly\u201d Arya groaned, making you brush harshly, looking down at your face. </p><p>At her words, you couldn\u2019t help but glance up, hoping to see the little, dark haired boy you had come to have so. You saw only the jarred cobblestone, no Bran to be found. </p><p>After excusing yourself, you headed toward the house. As soon as your small hand fell on the knob, you heard a faint noise and turned your head up. </p><p>Above you was Bran Stark, sitting atop a building, and you nearly fell in surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing Bran?\u201d you squealed, but he put his finger to his lips, trying to encourage your silence. Slowly he offered a hand to you which you took hesitantly, allowing him to lift you onto the ledge he was perched on. </p><p>You held to the cobblestone almost as hard as you were holding Bran\u2019s wrist. </p><p> He shifted your weight into him further, gripping your waist before leading your hands to the frigid wall \u201cHold on, I wont let you fall\u201d Bran suggested, not fazing you for a minute. \u201cPromise?\u201dyou wondered, your voice shaking and he nods \u201cPromise\u201d he swears moving a bit away from you.</p><p>Bran took a hand from you and moved up the wall, only stopping a few feet away to look down at you. It was clear he was expecting you to join him but it was hard with so much fear clouding your judgement. If only your father could see you now. </p><p>You hurried to join him, spite driving you now. Once you got there, you were at a loss for words, it was beautiful. \u201cWow\u201d was all you could say, taking in the expanse of the north, all dressed in white. Bran looked up at you from where he was resting, curious as to what got such a reaction out of you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, instantly earning a gesture from you out into the air. </p><p>\u201cAll this, every day of your life\u201d you urged, not understanding how he was so casual about so much beauty. You were in awe of the snow and large mountains, unlike you ever had before. </p><p>\u201cIt is gorgeous\u201d you added and he smirks \u201cprobably not as gorgeous as Kings Landing though\u201d Bran\u2019s tone irritated you, he always talked about Kings Landing as if it was so great, if only he knew. \u201cKings landing is not as great as it seems Bran\u201d you reminded, following him down the scaffolding, until your feet were safely on the ground again. </p></p>",
