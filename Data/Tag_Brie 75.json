Watching an equally bright smile spread over her lips. You had been friends with Carol since you were little; You grew up together. After everything that happened between her becoming a pilot and her apparent accident, there was nothing that warmed your heart more than finally getting to see her again. It was almost too hard to believe but you were so happy to see her. You started hanging out a lot since she reappeared. You wanted to remind her of the times you used to spend together when you were little and so you had spent all morning setting this up. Grabbing blankets and sheets from around your house, cushions, and fairy lights.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember when we were little and we used to sneak up here-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;and build a fort out of everything we could find- I do.

Bowing your head a little &ldquo;After you, my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How chivalrous.&rdquo; The blonde smiled softly before walking over and ducking inside. You followed her in. You had tried to make it as spacious as possible and for the most part, you were successful. You could fit two grown women inside but it was just a tad cramped. She sat down and you sat down next to her. You grabbed a tray you had stashed away earlier and placed it between you two. On it was two teacups. two teapots. and a biscuit tin.</p><p>&ldquo;You brought me in here to have&hellip; a tea party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By all means, fly the plane but you gotta take a break sometime.&rdquo; Carol has always been a rough and tumble kind of girl.

Deciding to drop the topic, you signal to the tray before you.</p><p>&ldquo;May I offer you a beverage, Miss Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you have?&rdquo; She asks.</p><p>&ldquo;Imaginary tea.&rdquo; You reply, pointing to one teapot and then to the other. &ldquo;Or coffee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tea please.&rdquo; She answered. you picked up the teapot and poured out the &ldquo;imaginary&rdquo; tea. you could have made actual tea but that ruined the experience and you wanted it to be authentic to your childhood. You were never allowed to use real tea because it was hot and you had a habit of making a mess so the chances of you burning yourself were pretty high. The tea was just water. The coffee was wine. When you were younger you used juice instead of wine.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember what happened the last time we did this? We were past the age of tea parties and test flights.&rdquo;</p><p>She shook her head. Picking up her cup, she took a sip of water. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was pissed off about something; I don&rsquo;t even remember what and you came over trying to cheer me up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I do a good job?&rdquo; Carol asks looking to you with curious eyes.</p><p>You shook your head. &ldquo;You freaked out actually and that was probably the last time I saw you before you left and made new friends and completely forget about me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could never forget about you, Y/N-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I kissed you,&rdquo; You admitted after a moment. She seemed a little surprised but her expression quickly softened again.</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Carol asks a small but noticeable smirk on her lips.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; You ask, brows furrowing.</p><p>&ldquo;You brought me here expecting a kiss.&rdquo;</p><p>Face flushed, your head shook rigorously. hands waving in front of you \u00a0&quot;No-no, I just, I thought this was cute.

It was almost too hard to believe but you were so happy to see her. You started hanging out a lot since she reappeared.

You had tried to make it as spacious as possible and for the most part, you were successful. You could fit two grown women inside but it was just a tad cramped. She sat down and you sat down next to her. You grabbed a tray you had stashed away earlier and placed it between you two.

You were never allowed to use real tea because it was hot and you had a habit of making a mess so the chances of you burning yourself were pretty high. The tea was just water. The coffee was wine.

There was a short silence and then Carol piped back up. \u201cNow I could do with a biscuit if you\u2019re offering.\u201d</p><p>Frozen for a moment, she smirked.
