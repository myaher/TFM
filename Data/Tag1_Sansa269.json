        "question": "People are saying that fore and blood is SO TOTALLY OBVIOUSLY meant to show D@ny as Alysanne reborn and that Sansa is meant to be Alaric in this metaphor bc they are both stern, u forgiving, and cold (what) and it foreshadows that they're gonna be the best of friends. Like... lmfao how do people still thing that Good Queen Alysanne translates to Good Queen D@ny?? The idea that this foreshadows that sansa will betray the north and be bffs with D@ny is infinitely more delulu than any Jonsa theory.",
        "answer": "<p>Dear nonny,</p><p>yes, it is so hilarious isn\u2019t it? As far as I am aware the Jonsa fam has pointed out that Alysanne and Sansa have similarities for quite some time. I read the first post on that topic just after season 6. So, this has been discussed way before the excerpt was published, and it is certainly not something that we came up with out of thin air. <br/></p><p>I just give some examples for parallels of Alysanne with Sansa and juxtapositions resp. foils with Da\u20acnerys to drive home the point:</p><blockquote><p>Even a lord as stern and flinty as Alaric Stark found himself helpless before Queen Alysanne\u2019s stubborn charm. \n\n(Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p><p>\nThe women of Winterfell were taken by the queen\u2019s charms as well, once \nthey grew to know her; Her Grace became particularly close with Lord \nAlaric\u2019s daughter, Alarra. \n\n(Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p></blockquote><p>Now, compare this to Sansa exercising her social skills:</p><blockquote><p>\nShe is good at this, he thought, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that \nhis cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and\n question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His \ncousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first \ntime he&rsquo;d left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel&rsquo;s \nhair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without \nhis father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. \nYet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him \ngetting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he&rsquo;d had the sense to love her. \n\n(ASOS, Tyrion VIII)</p></blockquote><p>This was already pointed out by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> here (<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/post/178549106056/more-sansa-alysanne\">x</a>). I would add that Sansa is here friendly towards everybody despite the fact that she is forced to attend the occasion at the Lannister court. She has no reason to be nice to any of these people and yet she is. <br/></p><p>Sansa knows how important it is to show courtesy by entertaining people as we can see in AFFC when the Lord Protector and her entertain the Lords Declarant and try to negotiate with them. <br/></p><blockquote><p>She did indeed. She saw to the mulling of the wine first, found a \nsuitable wheel of sharp white cheese, and commanded the cook to bake \nbread enough for twenty, in case the Lords Declarant brought more men \nthan expected. &hellip;. The solar next. Its floor was covered by a \nMyrish carpet, so there was no need to lay down rushes. Alayne asked two\n serving men to erect the trestle table and bring up eight of the heavy \noak-and-leather chairs. For a feast she would have placed one at the \nhead of the table, one at the foot, and three along each side, but this \nwas no feast. She had the men arrange six chairs on one side of the \ntable, two on the other. &hellip; \nThe candles had been lighted, she was pleased to see; the solar smelled \nof nutmeg and other costly spices. She went to fetch the flagon whilst \nthe visitors arranged themselves side by side&hellip; (AFFC, Alayne I)<br/></p></blockquote>Compare this to Da\u20acnerys\u2019 way of getting people on her side:<p>\u00a0&quot;Unsullied!&ldquo; Dany galloped before them, her silver-gold braid \nflying behind her, her bell chiming with every stride. &quot;Slay the Good \nMasters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who wears a tokar or holds a whip,\n but harm no child under twelve, and strike the chains off every slave \nyou see.&rdquo; She raised the harpy&rsquo;s fingers in the air &hellip; and then she \nflung the scourge aside. &ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; she sang out. &ldquo;Dracarys! Dracarys!&rdquo;\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Dracarys!&rdquo; they shouted back, the sweetest \nword she&rsquo;d ever heard. &ldquo;Dracarys! Dracarys!&rdquo; And all around them slavers\n ran and sobbed and begged and died, and the dusty air was filled with \nspears and fire.\n\n(ASOS, Da\u20acnerys III)</p><p>While very effective, that is not exactly charming, neither is the show\u2019s \u201cThey can live in my new world or die in their old\u201d nor \u201cBend the knee or die\u201d. <br/></p><p>Even, when Da\u20acnerys tries to charm people for peace, she is not exactly good at it:</p><p>\nHizdahr ignored the eunuch. \n&ldquo;Magnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our union. \nYou heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.&rdquo;\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>&ldquo;It was my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this \nabbatoir, husband.&rdquo; She could hear the boar snorting, the shouts of the \nspearmen, the crack of the pitmaster&rsquo;s whip.\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sweet lady, no. Stay only a while longer. \nFor the folly, and one last match. Close your eyes, no one will see. \nThey will be watching Belaquo and Ghogor. This is no time for\u2014&rdquo;\n\n(ADWD, Da\u20acnerys IX)<br/></p><p>So, it should be obvious that charming is not the same as conquering (or coercing). Sansa has the parallels to Alysanne\u2019s charme. What about Alaric then? I saw a theory that he is Stannis, and that Alysanne\u2019s way from Whiteharbour to Winterfell foreshadows Sansa\u2019s way from the Vale to Winterfell. I must admit that Alaric has similarities to Stannis, but I doubt that it will be Stannis who takes Winterfell in the books.<br/></p><p>I think that Lord Alaric might be a nod to the Lord Royces, Brone Yohn Royce and Nestor Royce. Nestor Royce gets a bonus for having a daughter Myranda, that befriends Alayne /Sansa (and hopefully won\u2019t betray her&hellip;.)<br/></p><blockquote><p>\n Lord Nestor Royce seemed <b>gruff and stern</b>&hellip; (ASOS, Sansa VII)<br/></p><p>\nLast of all came the Royces, Lord Nestor and Bronze Yohn. The \nLord of Runestone stood as tall as the Hound. Though his hair was grey \nand his face lined, Lord Yohn still looked as though he could break most\n younger men like twigs in those huge gnarled hands. His seamed and \n<b>solemn </b>face brought back all of Sansa&rsquo;s memories of his time at \nWinterfell. She remembered him at table, speaking quietly with her \nmother. She heard his voice booming off the walls when he rode back from\n a hunt with a buck behind his saddle.\n\n(AFFC, Alayne I)</p></blockquote><p>There is another tidbit in the Blood and Fire excerpt that might remind us of Sansa:<br/></p><blockquote><p>Burley was apologetic for the quality of the food and drink presented\n to the queen, and the rudeness of the accommodations at Castle Black. \n\u201cWe do what we can, Your Grace,\u201d the Lord Commander explained, \u201cbut our \nbeds are hard, our halls are cold, and our food\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is nourishing,\u201d the queen finished. \u201cAnd that is all that I require. It will please me to eat as you do.\u201d (Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p></blockquote><p>\nThe Jonsa fam, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5o8TD9gV-3o5eP0tDSTsQ\">@jonbonsnowvi</a> of course has already pointed out that this scene is \nmirrored in the show, when Sansa tells Dolorous Edd, that the food at \nthe Wall is fine (<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/178542807184/cant-believe-grrm-inserted-season-six-sansa-and\">x</a>, with the additions!).\n\n<br/></p><p>As for book evidence you might put that alongside this:</p><blockquote><p>The boy was unappeased. &ldquo;I wanted eggs today.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweetrobin, there are no eggs, you know that. Please, eat your porridge, it&rsquo;s very nice.&rdquo; She ate a spoonful of her own. (AFFC, Alayne I)</p></blockquote><div><p>Now compare this to Da\u20acnerys: <br/></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Reznak, &ldquo;and \nafterward there is a special cake. A women&rsquo;s cake, baked only for \nbetrothals. Men are not allowed to taste it.

I shall not be eating it. Nor shall I wash the noble Hizdahr&rsquo;s noble feet.&rdquo; (ADWD, Da\u20acnerys VI)</i></p><p>This is the wedding tradition of the people Da\u20acnerys wants to rule and she just rejects it.

I mean so did Rhaenyra, and Rhaenyra is a far closer parallel to Da\u20acnerys than Alysanne.</p><p>As for claiming that Jonsa shippers now suddenly want Sansa to have a dragon, that is really, really funny. We can see Alysanne as foreshadowing of Sansa a) by appreciating the characteristics the queens share and b) without wanting Sansa to become an exact copy and c) without wanting everything in that excerpt to be about Sansa. The little tidbit about Alysanne\u2019s dragon not wanting to fly north of the Wall certainly points to other plot points.<br/></p><p>It is a question of what are actual parallels, what are foils, what are juxtapositions&hellip;.

As far as I am aware the Jonsa fam has pointed out that Alysanne and Sansa have similarities for quite some time. I read the first post on that topic just after season 6. So, this has been discussed way before the excerpt was published, and it is certainly not something that we came up with out of thin air. <br></p><p>I just give some examples for parallels of Alysanne with Sansa and juxtapositions resp. foils with Da\u20acnerys to drive home the point:</p><blockquote><p>Even a lord as stern and flinty as Alaric Stark found himself helpless before Queen Alysanne\u2019s stubborn charm. \n\n(Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p><p>\nThe women of Winterfell were taken by the queen\u2019s charms as well, once \nthey grew to know her; Her Grace became particularly close with Lord \nAlaric\u2019s daughter, Alarra. \n\n(Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p></blockquote><p>Now, compare this to Sansa exercising her social skills:</p><blockquote><p>\nShe is good at this, he thought, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that \nhis cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and\n question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His \ncousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first \ntime he\u2019d left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel\u2019s \nhair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without \nhis father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. \nYet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him \ngetting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he\u2019d had the sense to love her. \n\n(ASOS, Tyrion VIII)</p></blockquote><p>This was already pointed out by <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/m61FcucyaOKFkj0gFLKRgJA\">@thelawyerthatwaspromised</a> here (<a href=\"https://thelawyerthatwaspromised.tumblr.com/post/178549106056/more-sansa-alysanne\">x</a>). I would add that Sansa is here friendly towards everybody despite the fact that she is forced to attend the occasion at the Lannister court. She has no reason to be nice to any of these people and yet she is. <br></p><p>Sansa knows how important it is to show courtesy by entertaining people as we can see in AFFC when the Lord Protector and her entertain the Lords Declarant and try to negotiate with them. <br></p><blockquote><p>She did indeed. She saw to the mulling of the wine first, found a \nsuitable wheel of sharp white cheese, and commanded the cook to bake \nbread enough for twenty, in case the Lords Declarant brought more men \nthan expected. \u2026. The solar next. Its floor was covered by a \nMyrish carpet, so there was no need to lay down rushes. Alayne asked two\n serving men to erect the trestle table and bring up eight of the heavy \noak-and-leather chairs. For a feast she would have placed one at the \nhead of the table, one at the foot, and three along each side, but this \nwas no feast. She had the men arrange six chairs on one side of the \ntable, two on the other. \u2026 \nThe candles had been lighted, she was pleased to see; the solar smelled \nof nutmeg and other costly spices. She went to fetch the flagon whilst \nthe visitors arranged themselves side by side\u2026 (AFFC, Alayne I)<br></p></blockquote>Compare this to Da\u20acnerys\u2019 way of getting people on her side:<p>\u00a0\"Unsullied!\u201c Dany galloped before them, her silver-gold braid \nflying behind her, her bell chiming with every stride. \"Slay the Good \nMasters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who wears a tokar or holds a whip,\n but harm no child under twelve, and strike the chains off every slave \nyou see.\u201d She raised the harpy\u2019s fingers in the air \u2026 and then she \nflung the scourge aside. \u201cFreedom!\u201d she sang out. \u201cDracarys! Dracarys!\u201d\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cDracarys!\u201d they shouted back, the sweetest \nword she\u2019d ever heard. \u201cDracarys! Dracarys!\u201d And all around them slavers\n ran and sobbed and begged and died, and the dusty air was filled with \nspears and fire.\n\n(ASOS, Da\u20acnerys III)</p><p>While very effective, that is not exactly charming, neither is the show\u2019s \u201cThey can live in my new world or die in their old\u201d nor \u201cBend the knee or die\u201d. <br></p><p>Even, when Da\u20acnerys tries to charm people for peace, she is not exactly good at it:</p><p>\nHizdahr ignored the eunuch. \n\u201cMagnificence, the people of Meereen have come to celebrate our union. \nYou heard them cheering you. Do not cast away their love.\u201d\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cIt was my floppy ears they cheered, not me. Take me from this \nabbatoir, husband.\u201d She could hear the boar snorting, the shouts of the \nspearmen, the crack of the pitmaster\u2019s whip.\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br></p><p>\u201cSweet lady, no.

This is no time for\u2014\u201d\n\n(ADWD, Da\u20acnerys IX)<br></p><p>So, it should be obvious that charming is not the same as conquering (or coercing). Sansa has the parallels to Alysanne\u2019s charme. What about Alaric then? I saw a theory that he is Stannis, and that Alysanne\u2019s way from Whiteharbour to Winterfell foreshadows Sansa\u2019s way from the Vale to Winterfell. I must admit that Alaric has similarities to Stannis, but I doubt that it will be Stannis who takes Winterfell in the books.<br></p><p>I think that Lord Alaric might be a nod to the Lord Royces, Brone Yohn Royce and Nestor Royce. Nestor Royce gets a bonus for having a daughter Myranda, that befriends Alayne /Sansa (and hopefully won\u2019t betray her\u2026.)<br></p><blockquote><p>\n Lord Nestor Royce seemed <b>gruff and stern</b>\u2026 (ASOS, Sansa VII)<br></p><p>\nLast of all came the Royces, Lord Nestor and Bronze Yohn. The \nLord of Runestone stood as tall as the Hound. Though his hair was grey \nand his face lined, Lord Yohn still looked as though he could break most\n younger men like twigs in those huge gnarled hands. His seamed and \n<b>solemn </b>face brought back all of Sansa\u2019s memories of his time at \nWinterfell. She remembered him at table, speaking quietly with her \nmother. She heard his voice booming off the walls when he rode back from\n a hunt with a buck behind his saddle.\n\n(AFFC, Alayne I)</p></blockquote><p>There is another tidbit in the Blood and Fire excerpt that might remind us of Sansa:<br></p><blockquote><p>Burley was apologetic for the quality of the food and drink presented\n to the queen, and the rudeness of the accommodations at Castle Black. \n\u201cWe do what we can, Your Grace,\u201d the Lord Commander explained, \u201cbut our \nbeds are hard, our halls are cold, and our food\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014is nourishing,\u201d the queen finished. \u201cAnd that is all that I require. It will please me to eat as you do.\u201d (Blood and Fire, excerpt)</p></blockquote><p>\nThe Jonsa fam, <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mn5o8TD9gV-3o5eP0tDSTsQ\">@jonbonsnowvi</a> of course has already pointed out that this scene is \nmirrored in the show, when Sansa tells Dolorous Edd, that the food at \nthe Wall is fine (<a href=\"https://fedonciadale.tumblr.com/post/178542807184/cant-believe-grrm-inserted-season-six-sansa-and\">x</a>, with the additions!).\n\n<br></p><p>As for book evidence you might put that alongside this:</p><blockquote><p>The boy was unappeased. \u201cI wanted eggs today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetrobin, there are no eggs, you know that. Please, eat your porridge, it\u2019s very nice.\u201d She ate a spoonful of her own. (AFFC, Alayne I)</p></blockquote><div><p>Now compare this to Da\u20acnerys: <br></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d said Reznak, \u201cand \nafterward there is a special cake.

His name is Bronn, currently serving Tyrion Lannister in King&rsquo;s Landing. She wants to kill him in the most gruesome way possible, but when it comes to exactly that, she is incapable of doing it. Denial of her feelings will only take both of them so far, in a constant competition of who hurts whom the most. He deserves her fury, but does she deserve his cold shoulder?<br />A game of inner battles soon turns into a very unpleasant confession, but who will break first? The cold hearted sellsword or the mentally unstable assassin?</p><p>Words: 1163, Chapters: 1/?, Language: English</p><ul><li>Fandoms: <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Game%20of%20Thrones%20(TV)/works\">Game of Thrones (TV)</a>, <a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/tags/A%20Song%20of%20Ice%20and%20Fire%20-%20George%20R*d*%20R*d*%20Martin/works\">A Song of Ice and Fire - George R.
