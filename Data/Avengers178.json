You didn\u2019t really understand how it worked but you got the concept of it no matter how confusing it was. </p><p>You on the other hand spent the whole day at work, you had been called in early in the morning for an emergency 12 hour shift in the ER. Tony often insisted that you don\u2019t need to work especially because you were dating a billionaire who could literally afford anything you ever wanted and more but you\u2019d never do that. You became a nurse because it was what your parents wanted to see you become and you loved your job no matter how exhausting it could get. </p><p>You had just got out of the shower to find a half asleep Tony lying in bed staring at you dreamily. \u201cY/n can you come to bed now? I wanna sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait up for me you know,\u201d you said as you slipped under the covers on the other side.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t see you all day and I missed you,\u201d he pouted making puppy dog eyes.</p><p>You cuddled up next to him putting your head on his chest and gave him a peck on the cheek. \u201cI missed you too you know\u201d</p><p>The two of you didn\u2019t sleep for another hour or so staying up and forcing your eyes open just so the two of you could have a little more time to talk. \u201cHey y/n I just realised something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d You hummed.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be our first Christmas together, we should do something special to mark the occasion you know\u201d</p><p>When was no response from you Tony turned around to face you and said, \u201cNow don\u2019t tell me you were planning to break up with me on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>You gave a soft smile and cupped his cheek, \u201cNo silly I wouldn\u2019t do that, I like you way too much to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Taking your hand from his face he kissed it gently, \u201cThen what\u2019s wrong? We don\u2019t have to go out if you don\u2019t want to, we can just celebrate here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I lost my parents when I was 16? I never told you but it happened a week after Christmas and ever since then I\u2019ve never really celebrated it. The happiest moments I\u2019ve had were with them and then after they died I didn\u2019t have anyone. I was all alone with these memories that I can\u2019t relive. So every time Christmas comes around I get sad and I really miss them.\u201c </p><p>\u201cy/n I\u2019m really sorry, that\u2019s gotta be really hard on you. We don\u2019t have to do anything for Christmas if you don\u2019t want to. I get how hard it\u2019s gotta be for you this time of year\u201d He said as he kissed your forehead.</p><p>The both of you drifted off to sleep not long after. </p><p>You woke up the next morning without Tony buy your side. You checked your phone and saw that he left you message saying: \u201cMorning honey, Bruce needs some help with a project at the lab I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be today but don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>You have a huge sigh and crawled back into your bed. It was your day off, your boyfriend wasn\u2019t home and you had nothing to do. Great. </p><p>Tony came home that night at 3am while you were fast asleep. You found him snoring so loud that he woke you up in the morning. \u201cGosh he must\u2019ve really over worked himself yesterday,\u201d you thought to yourself as you giggled at the sight of him. </p><p>Fast forward to Christmas week you couldn\u2019t believe your eyes as you walked into the lounge seeing hundreds of boxes all under yours and Tony\u2019s name. Apparently they were all presents from companies that either were currently working with or wanted to work with Tony. You went through a couple of them and some of the stuff they sent were absolutely ridiculous. Out of one of the boxes you found a metal cheese grate, in another you found a pillow with Tony\u2019s face on it and in one of the boxes that was sent to you you had found some Iron Man lingerie which you didn\u2019t even know was a thing. \u201cOooo I like that one maybe we should see what it looks like on,\u201d Tony said. Your face turned a bright red and you quickly shoved it back inside the box and walked to your room while Tony chuckled at the sight.</p><p>Sitting in your shared room you reached under the bed for the block shoebox which was filled with pictures of you and your family. Every Christmas reminded you of the last Christmas you had together with them. Your parents weren\u2019t the type to get up bright and early on Christmas Day and give you your presents. You guys always got up around 9-10am ish had breakfast and then sat on the living room floor, pulling out all the presents from under the table and putting in in the middle. You\u2019d all open presents that friends and other family members had gotten you first before opening the ones that you guys had gotten each other. You remembered oh so vividly that your parents had gotten you a stethoscope for Christmas, one of the Littman ones that were super expensive. And even though you probably couldn\u2019t use it till you started college, you were still so excited. You remember taking your fathers pulse and listening to his heart beat before doing the same to your mom that day. Your father joked that it was so good that you could crack a safe with that thing. </p><p>You felt a hand on your shoulder and you were pulled back into reality which was just a lonely girl staring at some old pictures.</p><p>\u201cI know you miss them y/n and I know tomorrow is gonna be hard for you but you don\u2019t have to bear that burden on your own anymore.

Tony often insisted that you don\u2019t need to work especially because you were dating a billionaire who could literally afford anything you ever wanted and more but you\u2019d never do that. You became a nurse because it was what your parents wanted to see you become and you loved your job no matter how exhausting it could get. </p><p>You had just got out of the shower to find a half asleep Tony lying in bed staring at you dreamily. \u201cY/n can you come to bed now? I wanna sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to wait up for me you know,\u201d you said as you slipped under the covers on the other side.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t see you all day and I missed you,\u201d he pouted making puppy dog eyes.</p><p>You cuddled up next to him putting your head on his chest and gave him a peck on the cheek. \u201cI missed you too you know\u201d</p><p>The two of you didn\u2019t sleep for another hour or so staying up and forcing your eyes open just so the two of you could have a little more time to talk. \u201cHey y/n I just realised something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d You hummed.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna be our first Christmas together, we should do something special to mark the occasion you know\u201d</p><p>When was no response from you Tony turned around to face you and said, \u201cNow don\u2019t tell me you were planning to break up with me on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>You gave a soft smile and cupped his cheek, \u201cNo silly I wouldn\u2019t do that, I like you way too much to leave you.\u201d</p><p>Taking your hand from his face he kissed it gently, \u201cThen what\u2019s wrong? We don\u2019t have to go out if you don\u2019t want to, we can just celebrate here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you I lost my parents when I was 16? I never told you but it happened a week after Christmas and ever since then I\u2019ve never really celebrated it. The happiest moments I\u2019ve had were with them and then after they died I didn\u2019t have anyone. I was all alone with these memories that I can\u2019t relive. So every time Christmas comes around I get sad and I really miss them.\u201c </p><p>\u201cy/n I\u2019m really sorry, that\u2019s gotta be really hard on you. We don\u2019t have to do anything for Christmas if you don\u2019t want to. I get how hard it\u2019s gotta be for you this time of year\u201d He said as he kissed your forehead.</p><p>The both of you drifted off to sleep not long after. </p><p>You woke up the next morning without Tony buy your side. You checked your phone and saw that he left you message saying: \u201cMorning honey, Bruce needs some help with a project at the lab I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be today but don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d</p><p>You have a huge sigh and crawled back into your bed. It was your day off, your boyfriend wasn\u2019t home and you had nothing to do. Great. </p><p>Tony came home that night at 3am while you were fast asleep. You found him snoring so loud that he woke you up in the morning. \u201cGosh he must\u2019ve really over worked himself yesterday,\u201d you thought to yourself as you giggled at the sight of him. </p><p>Fast forward to Christmas week you couldn\u2019t believe your eyes as you walked into the lounge seeing hundreds of boxes all under yours and Tony\u2019s name. Apparently they were all presents from companies that either were currently working with or wanted to work with Tony. You went through a couple of them and some of the stuff they sent were absolutely ridiculous. Out of one of the boxes you found a metal cheese grate, in another you found a pillow with Tony\u2019s face on it and in one of the boxes that was sent to you you had found some Iron Man lingerie which you didn\u2019t even know was a thing. \u201cOooo I like that one maybe we should see what it looks like on,\u201d Tony said. Your face turned a bright red and you quickly shoved it back inside the box and walked to your room while Tony chuckled at the sight.</p><p>Sitting in your shared room you reached under the bed for the block shoebox which was filled with pictures of you and your family. Every Christmas reminded you of the last Christmas you had together with them. Your parents weren\u2019t the type to get up bright and early on Christmas Day and give you your presents. You guys always got up around 9-10am ish had breakfast and then sat on the living room floor, pulling out all the presents from under the table and putting in in the middle. You\u2019d all open presents that friends and other family members had gotten you first before opening the ones that you guys had gotten each other. You remembered oh so vividly that your parents had gotten you a stethoscope for Christmas, one of the Littman ones that were super expensive. And even though you probably couldn\u2019t use it till you started college, you were still so excited. You remember taking your fathers pulse and listening to his heart beat before doing the same to your mom that day. Your father joked that it was so good that you could crack a safe with that thing. </p><p>You felt a hand on your shoulder and you were pulled back into reality which was just a lonely girl staring at some old pictures.</p><p>\u201cI know you miss them y/n and I know tomorrow is gonna be hard for you but you don\u2019t have to bear that burden on your own anymore. You got me okay?

Every Christmas reminded you of the last Christmas you had together with them. Your parents weren&rsquo;t the type to get up bright and early on Christmas Day and give you your presents. You guys always got up around 9-10am ish had breakfast and then sat on the living room floor, pulling out all the presents from under the table and putting in in the middle. You&rsquo;d all open presents that friends and other family members had gotten you first before opening the ones that you guys had gotten each other. You remembered oh so vividly that your parents had gotten you a stethoscope for Christmas, one of the Littman ones that were super expensive. And even though you probably couldn&rsquo;t use it till you started college, you were still so excited. You remember taking your fathers pulse and listening to his heart beat before doing the same to your mom that day. Your father joked that it was so good that you could crack a safe with that thing. </p><p>You felt a hand on your shoulder and you were pulled back into reality which was just a lonely girl staring at some old pictures.</p><p>&ldquo;I know you miss them y/n and I know tomorrow is gonna be hard for you but you don&rsquo;t have to bear that burden on your own anymore. You got me okay? Always.&rdquo; Tony gave you a reassuring smile as he pulled you up into a hug. &ldquo; I know Tony, and I&rsquo;m so grateful for you&rdquo; you replied.</p><p>The next day was Christmas and you woke up to see Tony wasn&rsquo;t in bed with you again. You checked your phone only to find that he didn&rsquo;t leave any messages either. When you said that you didn&rsquo;t wanna do anything special for Christmas you definitely didn&rsquo;t mean to be left alone the whole day again. You got dressed and cleaned up and made your way down the stairs. He wasn&rsquo;t in the lounge or the kitchen so you made your way down to the workshop to see if maybe he spent the whole night working on another project. </p><p>As you walked into the workshop you found that it was pitch black, you couldn&rsquo;t even find the lights. Whilst trying to navigate your way through the dark all of a sudden something started happening. You saw flashes of your past, the last Christmas you had together with your family. You saw your mom who looked oh so real taking out the s&rsquo;mores from the oven which were a family tradition. Your dad had chocolate covered all over his face while your mom teased him about babies who could eat cleaner than him. The room was full of laughter and giggles, their laughter and giggles. You couldn&rsquo;t help but smile and laugh as you got to relive your last Christmas together. When it ended the lights turned back on in the workshop and Tony was standing next to you. &ldquo;I know you said you didn&rsquo;t want to do anything for Christmas but I didn&rsquo;t wanna see you so upset today. I used the pictures in the album and some of your old home videos to recreate a hologram version of the last Christmas with your family.&rdquo; He said.</p><p>You ran into his arms and cried happy tears,&rdquo; oh Tony this means so much to me, thank you so much.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything to see you happy honey, It&rsquo;s the least I could do for someone whose put up with me for as long as you have&rdquo;</p><p>You giggled as the two of you stood there embraced in a hug for who knows how long.</p><p>You spent the rest of the day replaying the hologram and telling Tony things about your parents and what you guys would do to celebrate every year. And at the end of the day you both promised to make those Christmas family traditions your family traditions.</p></p>",
