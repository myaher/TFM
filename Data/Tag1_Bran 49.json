Personally, what do you think will be the bulk of the epilogue (scenes? dialogue? self-reflection?) and who would be the best PoV for it? thank you :)",

While her homecoming spark much join amongst those in the North, you couldn\u2019t help but feel that undying bud of hope wither slightly.</p><p>\tFor while Sansa Stark was a source of new hope, she was a source of bittersweet feelings for you. Having grown up along the Stark siblings, you formed a tight connection with the girl; one that was not shared in the way you longed for it to be. Dreams of holding her fell short when she talked about how she fancied the dear Prince Joffrey.<br/><br/>\tTime had passed now, and perhaps her heart had changed along with it. You wished that the glimmer of hope you held applied to that as well as you walked up to the main castle gates. The two guards stationed there looked you up and down, glaring at you stepped forwards.<br/><br/>\t\u201cI\u2019m Y/N L/N, my family has been serving the member of House Stark for centuries. I am here to take up my position as handmaiden to the Lady of the House.\u201d One of the guards scoffed at your words, shaking his head at the other.<br/><br/>\t\u201cLook here, peasant, Lady Stark gave us strict orders to-\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cLet my family enter without questioning. Yet it seems you have failed to complete this task.\u201d Shocked and wide-eyed, the guard turned to face Sansa. She stood stoically, a dark furred cloak graced her slim shoulders. Familiarly piercing blue eyes stared daggers into the bumbling men before you. With a slight smile on your lips you stepped past the guards as they apologized for the inconvenience. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N,\u201d Sansa said, her gaze softening as it shifted to you, \u201cit has been too long.\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cIndeed it has, my Lady.\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cSansa. You may always call me Sansa.\u201d She waved off your formalities, lifting you from your bowing posture as a true leader would. Heat rose to your cheeks as you met her icy stare once more. She had changed, something deep within her had shifted, but she was still as bossy as she had been in your youth.<br/><br/>\t\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Sansa,\u201d you said, straightening your back. \u201cI dreamed of the day you would return.\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cAs did I,\u201d Sansa replied, a sigh escaping her lips as she spoke. She glanced around the stone-brick walls of her home, as if comparing it to the memory she had so dearly clung to in King\u2019s Landing. \u201cCome now, I\u2019ve taken up my Lord Father and Lady Mother\u2019s chambers. There is much to sift through and clean.\u201d</p><p>\tThe walk through the silent halls of Winterfell was just that; deathly quiet. Even with the new vigor felt by the Northerns on their leader\u2019s heirs return, the halls of their home were still with loss. As you followed Sansa, you passed doorways to old rooms. One was Robb\u2019s, the boy King who treated you with kindness when you talked of Sansa. Another to the right was Rickon\u2019s. The poor boy never stood a chance against the harsh world around him. Then Bran\u2019s room, then Arya\u2019s, both empty and devoid of life. </p><p>\t\u201cI think about them, always,\u201d Sansa murmurs as she unlocks the door to the chambers that her parents once lived in. \u201cI see them in my dreams. Happy and alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways to be happy again, Sansa.\u201d You rest a hand on her cloaked shoulder and the girl turns her Tully blue eyes to you. She studies your face a moment longer before pushing the door before her open.<br/><br/>\t\u201cPerhaps\u2026.\u201d</p><p>At soon as the door opened, you both strode inside. A flood of warm memories rushed back to you. Ned Stark and Catelyn, raising their children, happy to raise you alongside them. You remember washing their fur blankets, being distracted by Sansa\u2019s singing in the distance. Then the Boltons. They burned those same blankets, just as they scorched the fields of the North. You remembered running for your life after your family had been killed.<br/><br/>\tAn alliance towards the Starks under the cruel rule of House Bolton was a death sentence. You had no choice but to leave your home behind. As much as it had pained you then, you were glad you did. If you hadn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have been reunited with Sansa.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the day that Rickon was born?\u201d You turned at Sansa\u2019s question, brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you replied, watching as she sat on her parent\u2019s old bed. \u201cYou were so worried by your mother\u2019s cries that you had me take you to the Godswood to pray.\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cYes, and I had you pray beside me.\u201d You nodded at the memory. \u201cDid you pray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cWhen my family was being torn apart by the lions, did you pray?\u201d Her words hung in the air between you. Such sadness fell from her words and your heart broke.<br/><br/>\t\u201cI did, Sansa. Every night I would pray that Robb would win each battle he fought. I prayed that we would find Arya. I prayed that I would see you once more before the life left my eyes forever. It seems the Gods have answered my prayers, for here you are.\u201d You moved as you spoke, standing in front of Sansa. In a fit of passion you ran your fingers through the strands of auburn hair that fell around her face.<br/><br/>\t\u201cI gave up praying,\u201d Sansa whispered, \u201cbut when I did I wished for you to save me. Not my mother, not my father\u2019s loyal men, not even Robb. Just you. I wanted\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d You stared into each other\u2019s eyes for a moment longer before you forced yourself to look away. If you could, you would stare at her all day; but the pit in your stomach, the lessons you were taught, it all told you that that want was wrong.<br/><br/>\tTurning away, you busied yourself with folding new blankets and old gowns. Your eyes wander to Sansa from time to time as she started to sort through old letters. The grey fabric stained with House Stark colors started to turn darker and with shades of blue mixed in as you sifted through Sansa\u2019s new dresses. The colors of House Arryn, where Littlefinger had stowed her away for safe keeping. The thought of the man alone made you shiver in disgust.</p><p>\u201cLord Baelish has placed himself in a great position, by your side.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cHas he?\u201d Sansa asked, not looking up from her letters.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d you continued, \u201cyou and Jon hold the power in the North now. I fear that he might try to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry not, Y/N. I don\u2019t trust him either. If there is one thing I learned in King\u2019s Landing it is that you can trust no one.\u201d You frowned at her harsh words.<br/><br/>\t\u201cExcept for family?\u201d Sansa turned then, blue eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cExcept for family.\u201d She bit her lower lip for a moment, suppressing a smile before she added, \u201cyou almost sounded jealous.\u201d She stepped towards you, her eyes darkening with desire. The pit in your stomach grew and you swallowed hard. You had missed her so much.<br/><br/>\t\u201cSansa, my feelings&hellip;they always lied with you even when-\u201d</p><p>\tA knock at the door disrupted your words that tumbled from your lips. Sansa torn her gaze away and moved towards the door. When she opened it, you took note of the panicked messenger that was breathing heavily. Sansa cocked her head at him.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cLady Stark, it\u2019s your brother-\u201d<br/><br/>\t\u201cWhat has Jon done now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot Lord Snow, mi\u2019lady, Lord Brandon Stark has returned!\u201d Sansa turned to glance at you, her wide eyes meeting your own. Without another word, the girl rushed out the door and you followed swiftly behind. When you made your way outside, slightly short of breath, a crowd had gathered around a large cart.</p><p>Sansa stood before it, staring at a brown haired boy who sat within it. It was Bran; older now, quiet with a blank expression on his features. He was no longer the boy you had grown alongside. None of the Stark children, those that had survived, were the same anymore.<br/><br/>Before you could get any closer, Sansa hugged her long-lost brother. He didn\u2019t move to return the embrace, but the sight comforted you nonetheless. Sansa\u2019s family was returning to her, piece by broken piece. It would take a while for her true self to return but you felt that one day it would.\u00a0</p><p>Family was Sansa\u2019s heart; and one day, you hoped to see yourself in her family alongside her siblings. As she parted from her brother, Sansa gave you a soft, familiar smile that brought you back to your youth. Perhaps that day wasn\u2019t too far off in the future.\n\n<br/></p>",

While her homecoming spark much join amongst those in the North, you couldn\u2019t help but feel that undying bud of hope wither slightly.</p><p>\tFor while Sansa Stark was a source of new hope, she was a source of bittersweet feelings for you. Having grown up along the Stark siblings, you formed a tight connection with the girl; one that was not shared in the way you longed for it to be. Dreams of holding her fell short when she talked about how she fancied the dear Prince Joffrey.<br><br>\tTime had passed now, and perhaps her heart had changed along with it. You wished that the glimmer of hope you held applied to that as well as you walked up to the main castle gates. The two guards stationed there looked you up and down, glaring at you stepped forwards.<br><br>\t\u201cI\u2019m Y/N L/N, my family has been serving the member of House Stark for centuries. I am here to take up my position as handmaiden to the Lady of the House.\u201d One of the guards scoffed at your words, shaking his head at the other.<br><br>\t\u201cLook here, peasant, Lady Stark gave us strict orders to-\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cLet my family enter without questioning. Yet it seems you have failed to complete this task.\u201d Shocked and wide-eyed, the guard turned to face Sansa. She stood stoically, a dark furred cloak graced her slim shoulders. Familiarly piercing blue eyes stared daggers into the bumbling men before you. With a slight smile on your lips you stepped past the guards as they apologized for the inconvenience. </p><p>\t\u201cY/N,\u201d Sansa said, her gaze softening as it shifted to you, \u201cit has been too long.\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cIndeed it has, my Lady.\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cSansa. You may always call me Sansa.\u201d She waved off your formalities, lifting you from your bowing posture as a true leader would. Heat rose to your cheeks as you met her icy stare once more. She had changed, something deep within her had shifted, but she was still as bossy as she had been in your youth.<br><br>\t\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Sansa,\u201d you said, straightening your back. \u201cI dreamed of the day you would return.\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cAs did I,\u201d Sansa replied, a sigh escaping her lips as she spoke. She glanced around the stone-brick walls of her home, as if comparing it to the memory she had so dearly clung to in King\u2019s Landing. \u201cCome now, I\u2019ve taken up my Lord Father and Lady Mother\u2019s chambers. There is much to sift through and clean.\u201d</p><p>\tThe walk through the silent halls of Winterfell was just that; deathly quiet. Even with the new vigor felt by the Northerns on their leader\u2019s heirs return, the halls of their home were still with loss. As you followed Sansa, you passed doorways to old rooms. One was Robb\u2019s, the boy King who treated you with kindness when you talked of Sansa. Another to the right was Rickon\u2019s. The poor boy never stood a chance against the harsh world around him. Then Bran\u2019s room, then Arya\u2019s, both empty and devoid of life. </p><p>\t\u201cI think about them, always,\u201d Sansa murmurs as she unlocks the door to the chambers that her parents once lived in. \u201cI see them in my dreams. Happy and alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways to be happy again, Sansa.\u201d You rest a hand on her cloaked shoulder and the girl turns her Tully blue eyes to you. She studies your face a moment longer before pushing the door before her open.<br><br>\t\u201cPerhaps\u2026.\u201d</p><p>At soon as the door opened, you both strode inside. A flood of warm memories rushed back to you. Ned Stark and Catelyn, raising their children, happy to raise you alongside them. You remember washing their fur blankets, being distracted by Sansa\u2019s singing in the distance. Then the Boltons. They burned those same blankets, just as they scorched the fields of the North. You remembered running for your life after your family had been killed.<br><br>\tAn alliance towards the Starks under the cruel rule of House Bolton was a death sentence. You had no choice but to leave your home behind. As much as it had pained you then, you were glad you did. If you hadn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have been reunited with Sansa.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the day that Rickon was born?\u201d You turned at Sansa\u2019s question, brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d you replied, watching as she sat on her parent\u2019s old bed. \u201cYou were so worried by your mother\u2019s cries that you had me take you to the Godswood to pray.\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cYes, and I had you pray beside me.\u201d You nodded at the memory. \u201cDid you pray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cWhen my family was being torn apart by the lions, did you pray?\u201d Her words hung in the air between you. Such sadness fell from her words and your heart broke.<br><br>\t\u201cI did, Sansa. Every night I would pray that Robb would win each battle he fought. I prayed that we would find Arya. I prayed that I would see you once more before the life left my eyes forever. It seems the Gods have answered my prayers, for here you are.\u201d You moved as you spoke, standing in front of Sansa. In a fit of passion you ran your fingers through the strands of auburn hair that fell around her face.<br><br>\t\u201cI gave up praying,\u201d Sansa whispered, \u201cbut when I did I wished for you to save me. Not my mother, not my father\u2019s loyal men, not even Robb. Just you. I wanted\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cSansa\u2026\u201d You stared into each other\u2019s eyes for a moment longer before you forced yourself to look away. If you could, you would stare at her all day; but the pit in your stomach, the lessons you were taught, it all told you that that want was wrong.<br><br>\tTurning away, you busied yourself with folding new blankets and old gowns. Your eyes wander to Sansa from time to time as she started to sort through old letters. The grey fabric stained with House Stark colors started to turn darker and with shades of blue mixed in as you sifted through Sansa\u2019s new dresses. The colors of House Arryn, where Littlefinger had stowed her away for safe keeping. The thought of the man alone made you shiver in disgust.</p><p>\u201cLord Baelish has placed himself in a great position, by your side.\u201d <br><br>\u201cHas he?\u201d Sansa asked, not looking up from her letters.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d you continued, \u201cyou and Jon hold the power in the North now. I fear that he might try to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry not, Y/N. I don\u2019t trust him either. If there is one thing I learned in King\u2019s Landing it is that you can trust no one.\u201d You frowned at her harsh words.<br><br>\t\u201cExcept for family?\u201d Sansa turned then, blue eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cExcept for family.\u201d She bit her lower lip for a moment, suppressing a smile before she added, \u201cyou almost sounded jealous.\u201d She stepped towards you, her eyes darkening with desire. The pit in your stomach grew and you swallowed hard. You had missed her so much.<br><br>\t\u201cSansa, my feelings\u2026they always lied with you even when-\u201d</p><p>\tA knock at the door disrupted your words that tumbled from your lips. Sansa torn her gaze away and moved towards the door. When she opened it, you took note of the panicked messenger that was breathing heavily. Sansa cocked her head at him.</p><p>\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cLady Stark, it\u2019s your brother-\u201d<br><br>\t\u201cWhat has Jon done now?\u201d</p><p>\t\u201cNot Lord Snow, mi\u2019lady, Lord Brandon Stark has returned!\u201d Sansa turned to glance at you, her wide eyes meeting your own. Without another word, the girl rushed out the door and you followed swiftly behind. When you made your way outside, slightly short of breath, a crowd had gathered around a large cart.</p><p>Sansa stood before it, staring at a brown haired boy who sat within it. It was Bran; older now, quiet with a blank expression on his features. He was no longer the boy you had grown alongside. None of the Stark children, those that had survived, were the same anymore.<br><br>Before you could get any closer, Sansa hugged her long-lost brother. He didn\u2019t move to return the embrace, but the sight comforted you nonetheless. Sansa\u2019s family was returning to her, piece by broken piece. It would take a while for her true self to return but you felt that one day it would.\u00a0</p><p>Family was Sansa\u2019s heart; and one day, you hoped to see yourself in her family alongside her siblings. As she parted from her brother, Sansa gave you a soft, familiar smile that brought you back to your youth. Perhaps that day wasn\u2019t too far off in the future.\n\n<br></p>",
