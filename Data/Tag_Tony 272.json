Steve looked up from his book, his eyes meeting with Tony&rsquo;s, who was looking back at him with the softest, the most love-filled look a human being was capable of. It was the kind of look that showed deep devotion and admiration and a promise of never-ending, eternal love. His hair was still a bit damp from the shower and his skin was glowing in the light of a night lamp. At that moment, it hit Steve with all might how much he loved the man in front of him and how he couldn&rsquo;t imagine his life without Tony in it. Tony was someone more than his best friend and lover. Soulmates were just a start of many expressions, Steve would use to describe their bond. It ran deep and strong, almost like an unstoppable force of nature of some sort. It was purely magical.</p><p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; Tony repeated, climbing on the bed, in slow, sensual movements, his long eyelashes fluttering delightfully and moist lips parted. Steve put his book aside, lifting on his elbows, and waiting. It was good to be back home for such a sweet reunion.</p><!-- more --><p>&ldquo;I missed you,&rdquo; Tony whispered, getting closer. Just when Steve thought that it would all lead into one direction, Tony collapsed on the bed beside him, burying his face into the pillow. &ldquo;Oh, how I missed you,&rdquo; he muffled into the pink material, snuggling his face into the satin and looking in bliss.</p><p>Steve needed a moment to wrap his head around what happened. Slowly, he pulled his eyebrows together and crossed arms on his chest. &ldquo;Very cute, Tony,&rdquo; he said dryly, watching his boyfriend giggle and continuing to rub his face against the material.</p><p>When two weeks ago, Steve had received an order to leave for a secret mission, Tony pulled his whole array of drama - whining, stomping, faking sickness - anything to try and keep his soldier at home. Steve was adamant on going, feeling that he had a duty to fulfill, while Tony kept claiming that his only duty was to stay by his side and there were others suitable for the kind of mission Steve was required to do. It wasn&rsquo;t true, and all of them had highly detailed profiles at SHIELD&rsquo;s archive, which listed their skills and strong points. If Steve was selected, there was no one else able to do it. Steve knew it. Tony knew it too. Didn&rsquo;t mean he would agree and let Steve without fighting. Steve had tried to make the departure easier and spend more time on cuddling and pre-making meals he stored in the freezer for Tony to reheat later on and even more cuddling. Then he had an idea to give Tony a present before his leaving, something his boyfriend could hold on to and wait for his return. He didn&rsquo;t expect his idea to bit him in the ass and yet, there he was.</p><p>Tony made a pleased sound, settling his face into the pillow, the one Steve had jokingly bought for Tony and handed to him saying &rsquo;<i>something to keep you warm and smiling</i>&rsquo; just before he had to leave. It was an average size pillow, in a light, satin cover. What was special about it, was that it was trimmed with soft feathers with a pinkish hue on each side. It was more decorative than for sleeping, and while Tony had accepted it with a forced smile, not finding this funny, he had put it on their shared bed anyway.</p><p>&ldquo;Hihihi,&rdquo; Tony giggled quietly when the feathery edge of the pillow rubbed his cheek. It was a reaction Steve was hoping for, but not when he was finally back home.</p><p>&ldquo;You really prefer to hug to this thing than to me?&rdquo; Steve asked, observing Tony and his cute smile. How someone so cute, could be so irritating.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, it keeps me warm and keeps me laughing,&rdquo; Tony quoted in a superior tone. He won&rsquo;t easily take any offense towards his pillow in his own bed. &ldquo;Something you were supposed to provide me with and then ditched me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I ditched you?&rdquo; Steve repeated, sounding minimally amused.</p><p>Tony solemnly nodded. &ldquo;Face it, Cap, you were replaced on your own wish,&rdquo; brunet replied. It would almost be hurtful, if not the playful glint in the brown eyes, showing how much Tony was enjoying this situation. Served the soldier right for abandoning him for two weeks.</p><p>Slowly, Steve raised a single eyebrow up in that stupidly sexy move that always made Tony feel a little hot. Then in one quick movement, he pulled the pillow from underneath Tony&rsquo;s face.</p><p>&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Tony yelled, almost choking on the feathers as the pillow grazed his face. He laughed a bit, and rubbed his cheek into the covers, trying to calm the skin down and erase the ticklish feeling the feathers left behind. &ldquo;Hey, my pillow!&rdquo; Tony complained, lifting up.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, what pillow? This pillow?&rdquo; Steve called teasingly, lifting his arm up and holding the pillow out of his lover&rsquo;s reach.</p><p>&ldquo;Give it back!&rdquo; Tony demanded, lunging himself at the soldier, and trying to free the fluffy object.</p><p>Steve waited for that. He used his free arm to wrap around Tony&rsquo;s form and strongly pushed on him, forcing Tony to lay on his back and spreading on top of him, holding the smaller man down.</p><p>Tony made some sound of protest, and then soft lips were pressed over his. Soothing and sweet. Awakening some feelings he didn&rsquo;t feel in a while. Warm and tingly.</p><p>When the kiss ended, they both sighed in satisfaction, missing this feeling. Missing the other so much it felt as if they got their breath back again.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you rather have me or this thing back?&rdquo; Steve asked in a smug voice, showing Tony the pillow. There was only one right answer to this.</p><p>Tony looked quickly at the pillow and then back at Steve. When he first received his special gift, he wanted to hurl it at Steve&rsquo;s empty head, yet with time, he somehow grew attached to it. Being nostalgic wasn&rsquo;t a word he would use to describe himself, and yet, here he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I have both?&rdquo; Tony asked. What followed next, was a lot of high pitched giggling as Steve pressed the feathery edge to Tony&rsquo;s cheek and ran it over his face. &ldquo;HAH! Hihihihihi!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you want to rethink this answer,&rdquo; Steve advised, smiling at his flailing and laughing boyfriend.</p><p>&ldquo;Sthihihil both!&rdquo; Tony managed to say through his laughter, secretly enjoying the light, feathery tickle on his cheeks and neck. It was even better when Steve was delivering the touch then the small, accidental tickle he felt on his own while snuggling into the pillow. After a while, it became pretty unbearable, and Tony started to crack. &ldquo;Stahahahap, Sthihihihive!&rdquo;</p><p>Somehow it was a relief to hear Tony call him by his name again. Slowly, Steve stopped and put the pillow aside and <i>wow</i>. Flushed cheeks, parted lips, sparkling eyes. He forgot how breathtakingly gorgeous Tony was. A long, deep kiss seemed very appropriate at the moment.</p><p>Tony moaned pleasantly, the sweet feeling engulfing him once more. No other feeling could compare to the one of being together with Steve. Seemed that his two-week romance with the pillow ended.</p><p>Or\u2026</p><p>Tony yanked the pillow out of Steve&rsquo;s hands and whacked him in the back without any warning.</p><p>&ldquo;OW! What the&mdash;&rdquo; Steve protested, blinking at Tony&rsquo;s mischievously smiling face. &ldquo;Oh, you want to play like this?!&rdquo; he called in fake anger, squeezing and wriggling fingers into Tony&rsquo;s bare sides and ribs, getting a deep laughter out of his boyfriend this time. Tony kept laughing, carefree and loud and it sounded like a song to Steve. Their very own melody. He really missed those moments and had a feeling that Tony missed them too.</p><p>And the pillow lay on its side and rested, fulfilling its own mission. Until next time.</p>",

Steve looked up from his book, his eyes meeting with Tony\u2019s, who was looking back at him with the softest, the most love-filled look a human being was capable of. It was the kind of look that showed deep devotion and admiration and a promise of never-ending, eternal love. His hair was still a bit damp from the shower and his skin was glowing in the light of a night lamp. At that moment, it hit Steve with all might how much he loved the man in front of him and how he couldn\u2019t imagine his life without Tony in it. Tony was someone more than his best friend and lover. Soulmates were just a start of many expressions, Steve would use to describe their bond. It ran deep and strong, almost like an unstoppable force of nature of some sort. It was purely magical.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Tony repeated, climbing on the bed, in slow, sensual movements, his long eyelashes fluttering delightfully and moist lips parted. Steve put his book aside, lifting on his elbows, and waiting. It was good to be back home for such a sweet reunion.</p>[[MORE]]<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Tony whispered, getting closer. Just when Steve thought that it would all lead into one direction, Tony collapsed on the bed beside him, burying his face into the pillow. \u201cOh, how I missed you,\u201d he muffled into the pink material, snuggling his face into the satin and looking in bliss.</p><p>Steve needed a moment to wrap his head around what happened. Slowly, he pulled his eyebrows together and crossed arms on his chest. \u201cVery cute, Tony,\u201d he said dryly, watching his boyfriend giggle and continuing to rub his face against the material.</p><p>When two weeks ago, Steve had received an order to leave for a secret mission, Tony pulled his whole array of drama - whining, stomping, faking sickness - anything to try and keep his soldier at home. Steve was adamant on going, feeling that he had a duty to fulfill, while Tony kept claiming that his only duty was to stay by his side and there were others suitable for the kind of mission Steve was required to do. It wasn\u2019t true, and all of them had highly detailed profiles at SHIELD\u2019s archive, which listed their skills and strong points. If Steve was selected, there was no one else able to do it. Steve knew it. Tony knew it too. Didn\u2019t mean he would agree and let Steve without fighting. Steve had tried to make the departure easier and spend more time on cuddling and pre-making meals he stored in the freezer for Tony to reheat later on and even more cuddling. Then he had an idea to give Tony a present before his leaving, something his boyfriend could hold on to and wait for his return. He didn\u2019t expect his idea to bit him in the ass and yet, there he was.</p><p>Tony made a pleased sound, settling his face into the pillow, the one Steve had jokingly bought for Tony and handed to him saying \u2019<i>something to keep you warm and smiling</i>\u2019 just before he had to leave. It was an average size pillow, in a light, satin cover. What was special about it, was that it was trimmed with soft feathers with a pinkish hue on each side. It was more decorative than for sleeping, and while Tony had accepted it with a forced smile, not finding this funny, he had put it on their shared bed anyway.</p><p>\u201cHihihi,\u201d Tony giggled quietly when the feathery edge of the pillow rubbed his cheek. It was a reaction Steve was hoping for, but not when he was finally back home.</p><p>\u201cYou really prefer to hug to this thing than to me?\u201d Steve asked, observing Tony and his cute smile. How someone so cute, could be so irritating.</p><p>\u201cHey, it keeps me warm and keeps me laughing,\u201d Tony quoted in a superior tone. He won\u2019t easily take any offense towards his pillow in his own bed. \u201cSomething you were supposed to provide me with and then ditched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ditched you?\u201d Steve repeated, sounding minimally amused.</p><p>Tony solemnly nodded. \u201cFace it, Cap, you were replaced on your own wish,\u201d brunet replied. It would almost be hurtful, if not the playful glint in the brown eyes, showing how much Tony was enjoying this situation. Served the soldier right for abandoning him for two weeks.</p><p>Slowly, Steve raised a single eyebrow up in that stupidly sexy move that always made Tony feel a little hot. Then in one quick movement, he pulled the pillow from underneath Tony\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d Tony yelled, almost choking on the feathers as the pillow grazed his face. He laughed a bit, and rubbed his cheek into the covers, trying to calm the skin down and erase the ticklish feeling the feathers left behind. \u201cHey, my pillow!\u201d Tony complained, lifting up.</p><p>\u201cOh, what pillow? This pillow?\u201d Steve called teasingly, lifting his arm up and holding the pillow out of his lover\u2019s reach.</p><p>\u201cGive it back!\u201d Tony demanded, lunging himself at the soldier, and trying to free the fluffy object.</p><p>Steve waited for that. He used his free arm to wrap around Tony\u2019s form and strongly pushed on him, forcing Tony to lay on his back and spreading on top of him, holding the smaller man down.</p><p>Tony made some sound of protest, and then soft lips were pressed over his. Soothing and sweet. Awakening some feelings he didn\u2019t feel in a while. Warm and tingly.</p><p>When the kiss ended, they both sighed in satisfaction, missing this feeling. Missing the other so much it felt as if they got their breath back again.</p><p>\u201cSo, you rather have me or this thing back?\u201d Steve asked in a smug voice, showing Tony the pillow. There was only one right answer to this.</p><p>Tony looked quickly at the pillow and then back at Steve. When he first received his special gift, he wanted to hurl it at Steve\u2019s empty head, yet with time, he somehow grew attached to it. Being nostalgic wasn\u2019t a word he would use to describe himself, and yet, here he was.</p><p>\u201cCan I have both?\u201d Tony asked. What followed next, was a lot of high pitched giggling as Steve pressed the feathery edge to Tony\u2019s cheek and ran it over his face. \u201cHAH! Hihihihihi!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you want to rethink this answer,\u201d Steve advised, smiling at his flailing and laughing boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cSthihihil both!\u201d Tony managed to say through his laughter, secretly enjoying the light, feathery tickle on his cheeks and neck. It was even better when Steve was delivering the touch then the small, accidental tickle he felt on his own while snuggling into the pillow. After a while, it became pretty unbearable, and Tony started to crack. \u201cStahahahap, Sthihihihive!\u201d</p><p>Somehow it was a relief to hear Tony call him by his name again. Slowly, Steve stopped and put the pillow aside and <i>wow</i>. Flushed cheeks, parted lips, sparkling eyes. He forgot how breathtakingly gorgeous Tony was. A long, deep kiss seemed very appropriate at the moment.</p><p>Tony moaned pleasantly, the sweet feeling engulfing him once more. No other feeling could compare to the one of being together with Steve. Seemed that his two-week romance with the pillow ended.</p><p>Or\u2026</p><p>Tony yanked the pillow out of Steve\u2019s hands and whacked him in the back without any warning.</p><p>\u201cOW! What the\u2014\u201d Steve protested, blinking at Tony\u2019s mischievously smiling face. \u201cOh, you want to play like this?!\u201d he called in fake anger, squeezing and wriggling fingers into Tony\u2019s bare sides and ribs, getting a deep laughter out of his boyfriend this time. Tony kept laughing, carefree and loud and it sounded like a song to Steve. Their very own melody. He really missed those moments and had a feeling that Tony missed them too.</p><p>And the pillow lay on its side and rested, fulfilling its own mission. Until next time.</p>",
