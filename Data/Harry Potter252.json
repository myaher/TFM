Walking across the desert corridors,\nHarry tried to find the right words to say. If he could convince him, maybe\nthey\u2019ll be able to avoid a civil war at Hogwarts. </p><p>As planned, Malfoy was in the infirmary. What Harry\nhadn\u2019t planned was to find him sleeping, backed against Pansy\u2019s bed, his wand\nin his hands. Zabbini was nowhere in sight, but it definitely was his jacket on\nthe blonde\u2019s shoulders. Biting his lower lips, Harry took a quiet step toward\nthe bed, unsure if he wanted to wake him up or not. He looked beautiful, finally\nappeased. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always prettier when he\u2019s asleep.\u201d Murmured a\nvoice against his ears, sending shivers down his spine. \u201cA move and I\u2019ll hex\nyou, am I being understood?</p><p>-I\u2019m here to talk, that\u2019s all.</p><p>-At midnight?</p><p>-It\u2019s not as if that could wait tomorrow morning.</p><p>-\u2018kay then. Just know I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d He warned,\nleaving his side to get to Malfoy\u2019s. \u201cDraco\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing\nthe pale skin as he talks. \u201cyou need to wake up, love.</p><p>-Two more minutes please. I was dreaming. I was flying\nabove the lake\u201d he smiled, eyes still closed, leaning in Zabbini\u2019s warmth. \u201cI\nwish I could stay inside my dreams forever.\u201d he slightly laughed of himself,\ndropping a kiss on his boyfriend\u2019s neck.</p><p>Malfoy\u2019s voice at that precise moment felt like the only\nsound Harry would like to hear before dying. Feeling his blush spread wider as\nhe imagined the blond git waking up to him, he did the only think his brain\ncould think of : \u00a0turning around to face\na wall and pretend to give them some privacy. It was stupid, all of this was\nstupid. He was there to make a battle plan with Malfoy, not feeling \u2026 things.</p><p>\u201cPotter\u2019s here to talk. </p><p>-Potter?</p><p>-Hi.</p><p>-Hi. What do you want?</p><p>-Talk about what happened today. I\u2019m kinda afraid it\u2019s\ngonna degenerate.</p><p>-Who\u2019s to blame.. </p><p>-Let\u2019s wait to be in the office to fight guys. No one\nwants to wake up Pansy. And you can turn around Golden Boy, no one\u2019s naked yet.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Pansy? I thought no one had been injured.\u201d\nHarry asked as the three of them sat around Madam Pomfrey\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cPhysically she\u2019s fine but she couldn\u2019t stop crying\nand shivering so madam Pomfrey is keeping her for the night. It\u2019s been a hard\nday.\u201d Malfoy casually explained. A stranger would have found him particularly\ncold hearted, giving no fuck to his best friend breakdown, but both Harry and\nZabbini knew better. The extreme righteousness of his posture and his too slow\nbreathing couldn\u2019t mislead them; he was making surhuman effort to keep his\ncomposure. \u201cThen, what did you wanted to talk about? \u00a0 </p><p>-Firstly I want it to be clear: it wasn\u2019t deliberate.\nShe was waiting alone and I thought that she could wait with us. I didn\u2019t knew\nthat Ginny would take it that way.</p><p>-Potter, we\u2019re in the middle of the night and I\u2019d like\nto get back to sleep, so please, come straight to the fact.</p><p>-I fear a kind of civil war. You have to talk to the\nSlytherins, tell them it was an accident. Tell them that we had never want\nPansy to get hurt.</p><p>-An accident? An accident! Your best friend accused\nher of killing his brother and you\u2019re talking about accident?

Walking across the desert corridors,\nHarry tried to find the right words to say. If he could convince him, maybe\nthey\u2019ll be able to avoid a civil war at Hogwarts. </p><p>As planned, Malfoy was in the infirmary. What Harry\nhadn\u2019t planned was to find him sleeping, backed against Pansy\u2019s bed, his wand\nin his hands. Zabbini was nowhere in sight, but it definitely was his jacket on\nthe blonde\u2019s shoulders. Biting his lower lips, Harry took a quiet step toward\nthe bed, unsure if he wanted to wake him up or not. He looked beautiful, finally\nappeased. </p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always prettier when he\u2019s asleep.\u201d Murmured a\nvoice against his ears, sending shivers down his spine. \u201cA move and I\u2019ll hex\nyou, am I being understood?</p><p>-I\u2019m here to talk, that\u2019s all.</p><p>-At midnight?</p><p>-It\u2019s not as if that could wait tomorrow morning.</p><p>-\u2018kay then. Just know I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d He warned,\nleaving his side to get to Malfoy\u2019s. \u201cDraco\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing\nthe pale skin as he talks. \u201cyou need to wake up, love.</p><p>-Two more minutes please. I was dreaming. I was flying\nabove the lake\u201d he smiled, eyes still closed, leaning in Zabbini\u2019s warmth. \u201cI\nwish I could stay inside my dreams forever.\u201d he slightly laughed of himself,\ndropping a kiss on his boyfriend\u2019s neck.</p><p>Malfoy\u2019s voice at that precise moment felt like the only\nsound Harry would like to hear before dying. Feeling his blush spread wider as\nhe imagined the blond git waking up to him, he did the only think his brain\ncould think of : \u00a0turning around to face\na wall and pretend to give them some privacy. It was stupid, all of this was\nstupid. He was there to make a battle plan with Malfoy, not feeling \u2026 things.</p><p>\u201cPotter\u2019s here to talk. </p><p>-Potter?</p><p>-Hi.</p><p>-Hi. What do you want?</p><p>-Talk about what happened today. I\u2019m kinda afraid it\u2019s\ngonna degenerate.</p><p>-Who\u2019s to blame.. </p><p>-Let\u2019s wait to be in the office to fight guys. No one\nwants to wake up Pansy. And you can turn around Golden Boy, no one\u2019s naked yet.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Pansy? I thought no one had been injured.\u201d\nHarry asked as the three of them sat around Madam Pomfrey\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cPhysically she\u2019s fine but she couldn\u2019t stop crying\nand shivering so madam Pomfrey is keeping her for the night. It\u2019s been a hard\nday.\u201d Malfoy casually explained. A stranger would have found him particularly\ncold hearted, giving no fuck to his best friend breakdown, but both Harry and\nZabbini knew better. The extreme righteousness of his posture and his too slow\nbreathing couldn\u2019t mislead them; he was making surhuman effort to keep his\ncomposure. \u201cThen, what did you wanted to talk about? \u00a0 </p><p>-Firstly I want it to be clear: it wasn\u2019t deliberate.\nShe was waiting alone and I thought that she could wait with us. I didn\u2019t knew\nthat Ginny would take it that way.</p><p>-Potter, we\u2019re in the middle of the night and I\u2019d like\nto get back to sleep, so please, come straight to the fact.</p><p>-I fear a kind of civil war. You have to talk to the\nSlytherins, tell them it was an accident. Tell them that we had never want\nPansy to get hurt.</p><p>-An accident? An accident! Your best friend accused\nher of killing his brother and you\u2019re talking about accident? She thought you\nhad forgiven her, that you were somehow friendly.</p><p>-I should\u2019ve brought Hermione.\u201d He mumbled for himself\nas Malfoy was visibly losing his attire of play/pretend. If he misused another\nword, the all situation would have been worsened.

Just know I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d He warned,\nleaving his side to get to Malfoy\u2019s. \u201cDraco\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing\nthe pale skin as he talks. \u201cyou need to wake up, love.</p><p>-Two more minutes please. I was dreaming. I was flying\nabove the lake\u201d he smiled, eyes still closed, leaning in Zabbini\u2019s warmth. \u201cI\nwish I could stay inside my dreams forever.\u201d he slightly laughed of himself,\ndropping a kiss on his boyfriend\u2019s neck.</p><p>Malfoy\u2019s voice at that precise moment felt like the only\nsound Harry would like to hear before dying. Feeling his blush spread wider as\nhe imagined the blond git waking up to him, he did the only think his brain\ncould think of : \u00a0turning around to face\na wall and pretend to give them some privacy. It was stupid, all of this was\nstupid. He was there to make a battle plan with Malfoy, not feeling \u2026 things.</p><p>\u201cPotter\u2019s here to talk. </p><p>-Potter?</p><p>-Hi.</p><p>-Hi. What do you want?</p><p>-Talk about what happened today. I\u2019m kinda afraid it\u2019s\ngonna degenerate.</p><p>-Who\u2019s to blame.. </p><p>-Let\u2019s wait to be in the office to fight guys. No one\nwants to wake up Pansy. And you can turn around Golden Boy, no one\u2019s naked yet.\u201d\n</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Pansy? I thought no one had been injured.\u201d\nHarry asked as the three of them sat around Madam Pomfrey\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cPhysically she\u2019s fine but she couldn\u2019t stop crying\nand shivering so madam Pomfrey is keeping her for the night. It\u2019s been a hard\nday.\u201d Malfoy casually explained. A stranger would have found him particularly\ncold hearted, giving no fuck to his best friend breakdown, but both Harry and\nZabbini knew better. The extreme righteousness of his posture and his too slow\nbreathing couldn\u2019t mislead them; he was making surhuman effort to keep his\ncomposure. \u201cThen, what did you wanted to talk about? \u00a0 </p><p>-Firstly I want it to be clear: it wasn\u2019t deliberate.\nShe was waiting alone and I thought that she could wait with us. I didn\u2019t knew\nthat Ginny would take it that way.</p><p>-Potter, we\u2019re in the middle of the night and I\u2019d like\nto get back to sleep, so please, come straight to the fact.</p><p>-I fear a kind of civil war. You have to talk to the\nSlytherins, tell them it was an accident. Tell them that we had never want\nPansy to get hurt.</p><p>-An accident? An accident! Your best friend accused\nher of killing his brother and you\u2019re talking about accident? She thought you\nhad forgiven her, that you were somehow friendly.</p><p>-I should\u2019ve brought Hermione.\u201d He mumbled for himself\nas Malfoy was visibly losing his attire of play/pretend. If he misused another\nword, the all situation would have been worsened. And Zabbini seemed to know it\ntoo, as he put a hand on his tight and drew little circles with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you clearly want?\u201d Zabbini asked, getting his\nattention back. \u201cWhat do you think Slytherins want? Equality. We, as a house,\nhave been treated like shit since the war and we\u2019ve endure it all without a\nword louder than the other. Even those who hadn\u2019t participate in the war. They\nall shut their mouth in respect and took the blame to ease the pain. We also\nlose people, and not only death eaters or Volde </p><p>-Don\u2019t say his name.</p><p>-or some allies of the Dark Lord but that\u2019s something\nno one wants to hear about. You don\u2019t have the right to ask them to shut up, as\nit what they\u2019ve done for months. You have to ask your tribe to start thinking,\nfor once.</p><p>-Zabbini, you don\u2019t get it. If we don\u2019t do something\nnow, then the gap between our houses will no longer be crossable.</p><p>-Ask Ronald and Ginevra to apologize publically.</p><p>-I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t.</p><p>-Potter, I don\u2019t think you understand what Blaise has\nbeen trying to say: people, and I say people because some Ravenclaws and\nHuffelpuff are tired of this too. Pansy didn\u2019t take part in the war. She\u2019d\nnever said a word against muggle born or half blood. She just never cared about\nthat. But because she\u2019s a Slytherin, she\u2019s a murderer; well, she isn\u2019t. She\u2019s\nsweet and caring and she would never hurt someone based on its blood or family.\nBlaise didn\u2019t want to say this aloud, but Hell I can. <i>I</i> am the only death eater and death eater\u2019s heir at Hogwarts. The\nothers are dead, at Azkaban, didn\u2019t come back or left the school. I am the only\none here who\u2019s guilty. But in the eyes of the Weasels, every Slytherin is. And\nwhen it\u2019s voice out by the Golden Trio, by the ones who Saved Us All, morons\nstart to think that they\u2019re allowed to act consequently, because they believe\nit too. And it\u2019s time for it to change. Some people are tired of this fucking\nManicheism where all Slytherin are evils and those people, I\u2019m not going to\nquiet them.</p><p>-And if they doesn\u2019t want to apologize?</p><p>-Then wake them up at midnight. </p><p>-I\u2019m here for a B plan, Malfoy, not for your sarcasm. We\nneed to do something to make them all see that Slytherins and Gryffondor can\nget along.</p><p>-Wait a sec.\u201d Zabbini interrupted. \u201cAre you here as\nPotter or as The Saviour?</p><p>-What? I\u2019m not doing this for fame or whatever\nbullshit</p><p>-No no no, I mean, are you here to make an alliance\nbetween the Saviour and the Ex Death Eater? Do you really believe that this\nwould work?</p><p>-Why wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>-Because you have to befriend Slytherins, not Draco,\nand you don\u2019t. We\u2019re the only ones you\u2019re talking to, you\u2019ve been sending the\nwrong message. Hang with Nott, take him as your anchor point in the breakfast\ntable tomorrow morning. Make yours see that they\u2019re the same. Everyone isn\u2019t\nable to forgive yet, but there is no need to forgive the innocent. That could\nwork. If everyone\u2019s okay with it, I\u2019m telling Theo right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s gonna work?\u201d Malfoy asked as\nHarry was starting to leave. \u201cDo you really think things can get better? Since\n6<sup>th</sup> year, I felt like time had kinda stopped, but since I\u2019m out of\nAzkaban, I feel like it\u2019s even slower. Watching the Dark Lord rise was like\nliving my childhood nightmares where the monsters seemed so real I had no other\nchoice than running to my parent\u2019s bed. You killed him, you killed the monster.\nBut the fear we all felt, it\u2019s still in the air. We\u2019re breathing it in and out.\nFear, pain and anger, that\u2019s our new atmosphere. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna\nwork. The wounds haven\u2019t healed yet, have they? And Ronald, he was right. He lost\nhis brother and you\u2019re here trying to protect me. I- I think I have a plan C.\nBefriend the rest of the Slytherin, but make me the enemy. They need someone to\nhate, someone to hold responsible for the horror that happened.</p><p>-Malfoy, you can\u2019t ask me that. You\u2019re already beaten\nup or hex every week, it would only get worse.</p><p>-I\u2019d rather get beaten up every day that stay at the\nbedside of another friend. And I\u2019m not asking for your permission. If we want\nthings to change, we have to make sacrifice.</p><p>-You cannot sacrifice yourself.</p><p>-Said the boy who walked to the forest, certain to\nfind death.</p><p>-I had no choice, I was an horcruxe.</p><p>-And I\u2019m not gonna die. They\u2019re kids and teens,\nPotter. I\u2019ve been through worse. Just don\u2019t say a word to Blaise.

Walking across the desert corridors,\nHarry tried to find the right words to say. If he could convince him, maybe\nthey&rsquo;ll be able to avoid a civil war at Hogwarts. </p><p>As planned, Malfoy was in the infirmary. What Harry\nhadn&rsquo;t planned was to find him sleeping, backed against Pansy&rsquo;s bed, his wand\nin his hands. Zabbini was nowhere in sight, but it definitely was his jacket on\nthe blonde&rsquo;s shoulders. Biting his lower lips, Harry took a quiet step toward\nthe bed, unsure if he wanted to wake him up or not. He looked beautiful, finally\nappeased. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always prettier when he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo; Murmured a\nvoice against his ears, sending shivers down his spine. &ldquo;A move and I&rsquo;ll hex\nyou, am I being understood?</p><p>-I&rsquo;m here to talk, that&rsquo;s all.</p><p>-At midnight?</p><p>-It&rsquo;s not as if that could wait tomorrow morning.</p><p>-&lsquo;kay then.

(Sorry I suck at summaries)</p><p>Nicole\u2019s p.o.v </p><p>*At the Burrow \u2013 In Genny\u2019s bedroom Year 5 (during the \u00bd blood\nprince)*</p><p><i>Dear Diary,</i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Why is my life so hard? I mean it\u2019s\nway less deadly and stressful than Harry Potters life and I wouldn\u2019t trade him\nlives for even a second; but still is a pain and sometimes I could just be my\nself and love who I want with out people bitching about it. I mean I am scared\nto even tell my best friend, Genny, because I am terrified that she will one\nhate me and two never want anything to do with me ever again. I mean my crush\u2019s\ndad gave her a bloody diary that made her open the Chamber of Secrets. She\nhates him for that. It almost caused her to lose her life, how could I be such\nan awful of a friend. </i></p><p><i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I mean she is so amazing to me,\nsince she\u2019s way more bad ass than me she sticks up for me, even though we are\nnot in the same house. I mean she\u2019s a Gryffindor and I am a Hufflepuff. Why would\nshe do that, even her brother and his friends do. \u00a0My own family doesn\u2019t even care for me that\nmuch. Which brings me to why I\u2019m here at the Burrow staying here for the rest\nof the summer. Genny begged me to ask my mum to see if I could come over and\nstay till school starts. My parents of course agreed I was out of their hair, I\nwasn\u2019t embarrassing them when they went out as a family. See I am not what my\nmom wants in a daughter. I can be loud while her motto is \u201cA lady should be\nseen, not heard\u201d. I like to be comfortable in my clothes, she wants me to wear\na corset; mainly because to her I am fat. Which I don\u2019t think is true and Molly\ntells me it all the time. I mean I am so much shorter than everyone standing at\nonly 5\u20192. That means weight just looks over proportioned if that makes se</i></p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSoooo,\nwhatcha doing Nic?\u201d Genny said ripping me from the little world I was in. I had\nthought she was a sleep so I was writing in my diary.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNothing\nreally, I was just writing.\u201d I said as I tapped my wand on the little book\nmaking all the ink and words I just wrote go into hiding. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t\ntrust her I just didn\u2019t trust Ron. He\u2019s gone through the damn thing way to many\ntimes.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cUh, that\u2019s\ntotally what you where doing,\u201d She giggled rolling her eyes \u201canyways can you\nget your lazy bum up? I do not want to be in the same room as mum and Flem by\nmyself.\u201d I laughed at this. Both her and Molly hated Fletur, her older brother\nBill\u2019s fianc\u00e9. It was comical to see them all be in the same space.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\nknow she is nice if you get to know her.\u201d I said holding back more laughs, \u201cBut\nI am starving and I was waiting for you to get up anyways.\u201d As I got up to pull\nmy robe over my nightie. All she did was roll her eyes and put her own robe on\nas well. Then we set off down the stair cases that I had learned not to fall\ndown through the years. When we arrived in the kitchen we saw \u2018Flem\u2019 and Molly\nin the kitchen. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey\nMum.\u201d Genny said waving at her mum tiredly.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey Mu-Molly\u2026\u201d\nI said with a blush that I had almost called her mum.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As she\nwas flipping eggs in a pan with her wand she looked relieved that someone had\ncome to help make the atmosphere less awkward. \u201cOh good morning girls! Have a seat\nand I\u2019ll get you some breakfast. Oh and Nicole, dearie, you can call me Mum I don\u2019t\nmind.\u201d She said with a smile. Now seaming happier now that she was no longer\nalone with the blonde French girl. She filled up our plates with all kinds of\nfood. She gave me a little less than Genny because she knew a Weasley size\nportion would give me anxiety due to the eating disorder my mother had\ninstalled in me. Genny, Molly and I started to talk about the up coming school\nyear. I had gotten a letter at the end of last week saying that I was chosen to\nbe a prefect for Hufflepuff. Along with a golden badge with a P on it. We were\nhaving a comfortable conversation even when Fleur would add random comments\nabout our conversation. That was until Molly asked me a question that I couldn\u2019t\nanswer for them with out hurting my best friends feelings.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNicole\ndear, do you have any crushes\u2019 at school?\u201d by the time she asked this the\ngolden trio had just sat down to breakfast. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cU-um\u2026\nNo.. uh I don\u2019t think\u2026 s-so..\u201d replying to that without shuttering was down\nright impossible. Genny gave me a look that basically said \u2018I know you are\nlying and when we get back up to my room you are telling me\u2019. Molly I guess\nthought it was odd too but just as she was about to question me further Hemione\njumped up and pointed to the 5 owls coming at the house. They were our school\nowls, Hemione looked as if she had seen a Swooping Evil and not an owl. I\nsilently thanked the owls for coming at that time.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We all\nlooked over our notes and everything, Ron and his mum argued. Then she told us\nall to get dressed because we were going to Diagan Ally (don\u2019t think I spelled\nthat right but I am too lazy to look it up\u2026). </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1109\" data-orig-width=\"1079\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/818e07934ea5b33cbdec48ba237e3b7c/tumblr_inline_pevuowbqT71v54kml_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1109\" data-orig-width=\"1079\"/></figure><p>I wore a black short sweater dress that\nhad a peak a boo hole in the back, my black and red combat boot heals, a necklace\nset that my great grandpa gave me, my lip and nose rings, and all my normal rings\non my hands.

As we pulled out of the Burrows drive way I drifted off.</p><p>A/N: I\u2019m ending it here because it is 2:31 am and I am exhausted.\nJust let me know how you think this went!

When we arrived in the kitchen we saw &lsquo;Flem&rsquo; and Molly\nin the kitchen. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey\nMum.&rdquo; Genny said waving at her mum tiredly.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Hey Mu-Molly&hellip;&rdquo;\nI said with a blush that I had almost called her mum.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she\nwas flipping eggs in a pan with her wand she looked relieved that someone had\ncome to help make the atmosphere less awkward. &ldquo;Oh good morning girls! Have a seat\nand I&rsquo;ll get you some breakfast. Oh and Nicole, dearie, you can call me Mum I don&rsquo;t\nmind.&rdquo; She said with a smile. Now seaming happier now that she was no longer\nalone with the blonde French girl. She filled up our plates with all kinds of\nfood. She gave me a little less than Genny because she knew a Weasley size\nportion would give me anxiety due to the eating disorder my mother had\ninstalled in me. Genny, Molly and I started to talk about the up coming school\nyear. I had gotten a letter at the end of last week saying that I was chosen to\nbe a prefect for Hufflepuff. Along with a golden badge with a P on it. We were\nhaving a comfortable conversation even when Fleur would add random comments\nabout our conversation. That was until Molly asked me a question that I couldn&rsquo;t\nanswer for them with out hurting my best friends feelings.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Nicole\ndear, do you have any crushes&rsquo; at school?&rdquo; by the time she asked this the\ngolden trio had just sat down to breakfast. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;U-um&hellip;\nNo.. uh I don&rsquo;t think&hellip; s-so..&rdquo; replying to that without shuttering was down\nright impossible. Genny gave me a look that basically said &lsquo;I know you are\nlying and when we get back up to my room you are telling me&rsquo;. Molly I guess\nthought it was odd too but just as she was about to question me further Hemione\njumped up and pointed to the 5 owls coming at the house. They were our school\nowls, Hemione looked as if she had seen a Swooping Evil and not an owl. I\nsilently thanked the owls for coming at that time.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We all\nlooked over our notes and everything, Ron and his mum argued. Then she told us\nall to get dressed because we were going to Diagan Ally (don&rsquo;t think I spelled\nthat right but I am too lazy to look it up&hellip;). </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/818e07934ea5b33cbdec48ba237e3b7c/tumblr_inline_pevuowbqT71v54kml_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>I wore a black short sweater dress that\nhad a peak a boo hole in the back, my black and red combat boot heals, a necklace\nset that my great grandpa gave me, my lip and nose rings, and all my normal rings\non my hands. I pulled my blonde hair back in a high pony tail grabbed my bottomless\nbag and wand then headed out to the Ministry car Molly and Mr. Weasley got\nbecause of Harry. As we pulled out of the Burrows drive way I drifted off.</p><p>A/N: I&rsquo;m ending it here because it is 2:31 am and I am exhausted.\nJust let me know how you think this went!
