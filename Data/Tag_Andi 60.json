        "body": "<h1>This Isn\u2019t Goodbye </h1><p>Summary: Cyrus gets notalgic as he and TJ get ready to go to college </p><p>Word count: 1219</p><p><br/></p><p>Dear Tj, </p><p><br/></p><p>When I was ten years old, my mom told me that when I meet the girl I fall in love with that I will see stars in her eyes, and an angel in her smile. When I came out to my mom as gay, she told me that nothing will change, but if don\u2019t see some type of glimmer in his eyes to leave him behind, and that\u2019s when I met you. God, the first time I looked into your green eyes I knew I was screwed. I never use to put the words green and happy together, but now that\u2019s all I think, because when I see green, I see you, and you are my happy. </p><p>I always think back to that day when my mom was talking to me about falling in love, I never really understood it. I didn\u2019t understand that I could actually get a zoo in my stomach when I looked at the right person, I didn\u2019t understand that the phrase \u2018I love you\u2019 held so much more than just three words, but most importantly I never understood how somebody could fall in love with me, the way you do. </p><p><br/></p><p>On our first real date you took me to a book store. We both picked out books for the other to read, then we went to target and bought fuzzy blankets and pillows, spending way too much money, then we drove around until we found an abandoned parking lot. We parked your car and made a little bed out of everything  we bought and we sat there, for three hours, just reading. We read in silence but that silence said so much. It said that I\u2019m comfortable with you, it said that I would rather spend time sitting with you and reading rather than going out on a Friday night. That was my most favourite night. After we finished reading I slid over next to you and I put my head on your chest. I could feel how fast your heart was beating, it was beating almost as fast as mine. After a few minutes you were treading your fingers through my hair, and I never felt something so soothing and electrocuting in the same sense, until you kissed me. That was our very first kiss, in the back of your car. And it was intoxicating, I knew at that moment, if I ever had to kiss just one person for the rest of my life, I would chose you. </p><p><br/></p><p>I remember our first fight as clear as day, but now looking back to it, there was nothing to fight about. We were sitting on my bed, you were the little spoon, and you whispered into my ear \u201cI love you.\u201d Every time you said that I melted a little more, but I felt like your \u201cI love you\u201d was a little bit more than that, it felt like it was drenched in apologies. I sat up from where I was sitting and said rather harshly, \u201cwhat did you do?\u201d You looked at me with sorrow eyes, at the brink of overflowing at any moment. You said that Lily Webster kissed you that afternoon, and you tried to push her away, but it didn\u2019t work. I yelled at you until my throat was bare, and I don\u2019t know why, all I knew in that moment was that I wanted to be the only person to feel your lips. After the screaming was over you left, and I kept beating myself up over how I reacted, so I left my room at 12:15 that night and ran over to your house. Like any romantic, when I arrived I threw pebbles at your window. When I saw you opening your window I saw that your eyes were bloodshot, you looked like you just cried a river, and my stomach sunk because I did that to you. I made you cry, and I made you doubt yourself for a stupid reason. When I apologised we hugged, a hug that said everything that it was meant to and more, and I promised myself at moment that I would never let go of you. </p><p><br/></p><p>Our junior prom was wild. We went out to get tuxes together, we decided to both wear grey suits  with paisley blue ties. I couldn\u2019t stop staring at you that night because of how perfect you looked, because Theodore, you looked so incredibly handsome. That night we danced until we couldn\u2019t feel our legs, and sung until our throats were bare, but that didn\u2019t stop us from going to Chase\u2019s party. Most people get worried when their partner drinks because they are scared of getting cheated on, but we were both hammered. The next morning when I checked my phone I had a few snapchats from Andi, and one of them was of you standing on a table and professing  your love for me. </p><p><br/></p><p>Your last ever high school basketball game was so bitter sweet. I remember staying up until midnight the night before making sure you\u2019re sign looked as great as you do. I decided to go with sparkly letters that said \u201cMay all your swishes come true.\u201d You let me wear your blue basketball hoodie, that said \u201cCaptain Kippen\u201d On the back. During your speech you said you couldn\u2019t have made it this far without me, but I want to tell you, I couldn\u2019t do this life thing without you. </p><p><br/></p><p>Senior prom was one of the most amazing nights of my life. Unlike junior prom, after we danced our hearts out and took home prom court, we went back to my house and stole some liquor from my dads liquor cabinet. We spent the whole night in my room passing bottles back and forth, talking about the future, exchanging kisses between. The next morning I woke up in your arms, I never wanted to leave, I felt so safe.</p><p><br/></p><p>Graduation, I was the valedictorian and my nerves overtook me. I remember right before we went on stage you took my hand in yours and kissed my palm, you promised me that everything was going to be alright. And it was, it was absolutely perfect, because you were by my side. We made it through high school together, but we were splitting apart in the end. You couldn\u2019t deny that chance at a basketball scholarship in North Carolina and I couldn\u2019t turn away Columbia, but we said we would have the summer and we did. We had the whole summer, and we spent it together. Days at the beach, nights in your car. Ice cream cones and s\u2019mores, milkshakes and baby taters, and long drives with our fingers intertwined.

When I came out to my mom as gay, she told me that nothing will change, but if don\u2019t see some type of glimmer in his eyes to leave him behind, and that\u2019s when I met you. God, the first time I looked into your green eyes I knew I was screwed. I never use to put the words green and happy together, but now that\u2019s all I think, because when I see green, I see you, and you are my happy. </p><p>I always think back to that day when my mom was talking to me about falling in love, I never really understood it. I didn\u2019t understand that I could actually get a zoo in my stomach when I looked at the right person, I didn\u2019t understand that the phrase \u2018I love you\u2019 held so much more than just three words, but most importantly I never understood how somebody could fall in love with me, the way you do. </p><p><br></p><p>On our first real date you took me to a book store. We both picked out books for the other to read, then we went to target and bought fuzzy blankets and pillows, spending way too much money, then we drove around until we found an abandoned parking lot. We parked your car and made a little bed out of everything  we bought and we sat there, for three hours, just reading. We read in silence but that silence said so much. It said that I\u2019m comfortable with you, it said that I would rather spend time sitting with you and reading rather than going out on a Friday night. That was my most favourite night. After we finished reading I slid over next to you and I put my head on your chest. I could feel how fast your heart was beating, it was beating almost as fast as mine. After a few minutes you were treading your fingers through my hair, and I never felt something so soothing and electrocuting in the same sense, until you kissed me. That was our very first kiss, in the back of your car. And it was intoxicating, I knew at that moment, if I ever had to kiss just one person for the rest of my life, I would chose you. </p><p><br></p><p>I remember our first fight as clear as day, but now looking back to it, there was nothing to fight about. We were sitting on my bed, you were the little spoon, and you whispered into my ear \u201cI love you.\u201d Every time you said that I melted a little more, but I felt like your \u201cI love you\u201d was a little bit more than that, it felt like it was drenched in apologies. I sat up from where I was sitting and said rather harshly, \u201cwhat did you do?\u201d You looked at me with sorrow eyes, at the brink of overflowing at any moment. You said that Lily Webster kissed you that afternoon, and you tried to push her away, but it didn\u2019t work. I yelled at you until my throat was bare, and I don\u2019t know why, all I knew in that moment was that I wanted to be the only person to feel your lips. After the screaming was over you left, and I kept beating myself up over how I reacted, so I left my room at 12:15 that night and ran over to your house. Like any romantic, when I arrived I threw pebbles at your window. When I saw you opening your window I saw that your eyes were bloodshot, you looked like you just cried a river, and my stomach sunk because I did that to you. I made you cry, and I made you doubt yourself for a stupid reason. When I apologised we hugged, a hug that said everything that it was meant to and more, and I promised myself at moment that I would never let go of you. </p><p><br></p><p>Our junior prom was wild. We went out to get tuxes together, we decided to both wear grey suits  with paisley blue ties. I couldn\u2019t stop staring at you that night because of how perfect you looked, because Theodore, you looked so incredibly handsome. That night we danced until we couldn\u2019t feel our legs, and sung until our throats were bare, but that didn\u2019t stop us from going to Chase\u2019s party. Most people get worried when their partner drinks because they are scared of getting cheated on, but we were both hammered. The next morning when I checked my phone I had a few snapchats from Andi, and one of them was of you standing on a table and professing  your love for me. </p><p><br></p><p>Your last ever high school basketball game was so bitter sweet. I remember staying up until midnight the night before making sure you\u2019re sign looked as great as you do. I decided to go with sparkly letters that said \u201cMay all your swishes come true.\u201d You let me wear your blue basketball hoodie, that said \u201cCaptain Kippen\u201d On the back. During your speech you said you couldn\u2019t have made it this far without me, but I want to tell you, I couldn\u2019t do this life thing without you. </p><p><br></p><p>Senior prom was one of the most amazing nights of my life. Unlike junior prom, after we danced our hearts out and took home prom court, we went back to my house and stole some liquor from my dads liquor cabinet. We spent the whole night in my room passing bottles back and forth, talking about the future, exchanging kisses between. The next morning I woke up in your arms, I never wanted to leave, I felt so safe.</p><p><br></p><p>Graduation, I was the valedictorian and my nerves overtook me. I remember right before we went on stage you took my hand in yours and kissed my palm, you promised me that everything was going to be alright. And it was, it was absolutely perfect, because you were by my side. We made it through high school together, but we were splitting apart in the end. You couldn\u2019t deny that chance at a basketball scholarship in North Carolina and I couldn\u2019t turn away Columbia, but we said we would have the summer and we did. We had the whole summer, and we spent it together. Days at the beach, nights in your car. Ice cream cones and s\u2019mores, milkshakes and baby taters, and long drives with our fingers intertwined. I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. </p><p><br></p><p>Now, tonight, is the last night I get to spend with you, and I don\u2019t want you to leave.
