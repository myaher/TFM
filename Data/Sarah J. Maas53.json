Before I could think about the scary and if I was being honest fascinating female the last member of their part entered the room and my heart stopped as I as gazed at devastatingly perfect features of the male I knew by the power roiling of him in waves by the wisps of dark emanating from him that was the high Lord.

Exiting the cozy alcove in the corner of the library in my family\u2019s mansion I made my way toward my sister scowling at the skirts and corset of my gown, so different from the tunics and pants I usually wore, mother had insisted I wear this bright pink monstrosity of tulle, gossamer and silk to greet the fae royalty visiting our estate to establish trading ties with my father I was confused as to why they would want to do that Prythian had always been more prosperous than the human lands and the court which was visiting puzzled me too, while we had minimum contact with the fae counterpart of our lands even I had heard stories of the high Lord of night\u2019s court and his \u2018reign of terror\u2019, the stories painted him as ruthless, brutal and powerful- I was pulled out of my musings by my sister snapping her fingers in front of my face </p><p>\u201cHello, did u even hear what I said?\u201d she asked</p><p>\u201cSorry\u201d I replied \u201cI was just thinking about something.\u201d </p><p>She rolled her eyes and told me to come downstairs quick or we would be late to greet the guests. We hurried down the stairs and saw our parents and other sister elain already waiting in the overtly opulent parlor. My mother glanced at me her blue grey eyes- eyes Nesta and I had inherited from her- flashing with disapproval \u201cWould it kill you to be on time for once?\u201d she said coldly I bit my tongue to hold back my less than appropriate response instead saying \u201cI was in the library reading and lost track of time, besides it hardly matters they\u2019re not even here yet.\u201d She opened her mouth, probably to reprimand me for not simply apologizing and letting it go when our house keeper Hazelle came forward and informed us that our guests had arrived. Quickly my family\u2019s demeanor changed, my mother\u2019s face so disapproving a second ago morphed into a smile, my father sat up straighter before giving me a brief smile to show me that HE  was on my side, Elain smoothed the skirts of her sunflower yellow dress and Nesta held her head high and stared straight at the door. I nervously fingered my lapiz lazuli pendant, a gift my grandmother had given me 17 years ago on my first birthday it was beautiful- the blue stone set in a delicate silver oval with little tendrils of silver on the edges. Then the door opened to admit in two large muscled winged males both with hazel eyes and shoulder length hair, they were both extremely handsome but then all the fae are. Before I could observe them properly my attention was caught by the two females entering the room one of them with long golden curls and brown eyes the color of freshly tilled soil was the most beautiful woman- or rather female- I had ever seen and beside her was a short petite femlae with poker straight, chin length inky black hair and quicksilver eyes, a chill went down my spine when I spotted her some deep, intrinsic part of me screaming at me to be wary of her, of the power I could see glimmering in her eyes. Before I could think about the scary and if I was being honest fascinating female the last member of their part entered the room and my heart stopped as I as gazed at devastatingly perfect features of the male I knew by the power roiling of him in waves by the wisps of dark emanating from him that was the high Lord. He looked at me with those remarkable violet eyes glimmering with what looked like stars, a few strands of his blue black hair brushing his eyebrows and smirked.</p></p>",

In comparison to the 2 other books in this series that I have already read, this was definitely my favourite. There were so many scenes in this book that I loved so much, especially Celaena\u2019s first fight with the skinwalkers and when she \u2018demonstrated\u2019 her magic for Maeve. They were enrolling and well executed, keeping me engaged and waiting for more action-packed content. <br/><br/>We were introduced to a number of new characters in this book, one, in particular, is Rowan. My first impression of Rowan wasn\u2019t necessarily positive or negative, it was more of an \u201cokay, you\u2019re obviously going to be important,\u201d and that was about it. Though my opinion of him developed quickly as his character became more third dimensional. <br/><br/>I\u2019m not usually a big fan of having so many different character\u2019s plotlines being explored in alternating chapters - and when they are largely separated from one another - but I enjoyed how it was done here. While there were some character\u2019s storylines that I was more invested in, being able to see all of the different happenings within this fantastical world answered some of my questions from the previous books and helped to bring this fantasy world to life in a more full, 3-Dimensional manner. <br/><h2>4.75/5 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</h2><div><i>Started 8/3/19 - Finished 17/3/19</i></div>",

They were enrolling and well executed, keeping me engaged and waiting for more action-packed content. <br><br>We were introduced to a number of new characters in this book, one, in particular, is Rowan. My first impression of Rowan wasn\u2019t necessarily positive or negative, it was more of an \u201cokay, you\u2019re obviously going to be important,\u201d and that was about it. Though my opinion of him developed quickly as his character became more third dimensional. <br><br>I\u2019m not usually a big fan of having so many different character\u2019s plotlines being explored in alternating chapters - and when they are largely separated from one another - but I enjoyed how it was done here. While there were some character\u2019s storylines that I was more invested in, being able to see all of the different happenings within this fantastical world answered some of my questions from the previous books and helped to bring this fantasy world to life in a more full, 3-Dimensional manner. <br><h2>4.75/5 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</h2><div><i>Started 8/3/19 - Finished 17/3/19</i></div></p>",

Literally engineered for me to swoon.\u00a0<br/></p><p>I was so into this book, it is action-packed, full of bad-ass women, and has a wonderfully tense romance.\u00a0</p><p>My surprise favorite thing about this book was the friendship between Selina, Ivy, and Harley. Selina and Ivy specifically had such a sweet meaningful friendship. I was really enamored by the two of them.\u00a0</p><p>It is SJ Maas&rsquo;s thing to write about broken girls breaking the world back. We all know this. We can debate about many things about her books but I think most people can agree that is a theme she goes for often. And I think it worked SO WELL in Gotham. I really enjoyed the deep dive into Selina, I have never read any of her comics and my only previous exposure to her was Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s incarnation, and I was never super enthralled by her. Didn&rsquo;t have negative feelings, but I never went to seek out Catwoman comics. Now I have things to google.\u00a0</p><p>I always think that I don&rsquo;t like it when the narrator reveals a plot they have been hiding from the reader, that moment where everything that has merely been hinted at falls perfectly into place and leaves you going &ldquo;OH GOOD THE WORLD IS NOT DYING&rdquo; then immediately telling yourself that you knew all along you should have never worried (of course then basically everyone throws something in that you should actually worry about but that is a different topic). That thing. I tell myself I hate it but history shows otherwise. Maas did it in Queen of Shadows (and probably other books), Leigh Bardugo does it in SIx of Crows, Crooked Kingdom, and King of Scars, and these are all books I liked a lot. So I guess this formula does work on me and I do not resent it as much as I thought.\u00a0</p><p>The other POV character in this book is Luke Fox, Lucius Fox&rsquo;s son. He is competent, interesting, and nuances. He has the &lsquo;super strong alpha male&rsquo; thing that SJ Maas is known for, but is also completely in love with his parents, genuinely cares for the people around him, and respects women. Maas thanks Nic Stone and Jason Reynolds in the acknowledgments of this book and you can totally see their impact on this book. Side note: I LOVE Nic Stone if you haven&rsquo;t read her GO FORTH AND DO IT! Also, this has reminded me that I need to read Jason Reynolds. He has been on my list for years and I am headed to acquire something of his ASAP. I would, of course, defer to readers who are black with opinions on how well she handled writing a black man, but I really liked him! I appreciated his reflections about how wealth didn&rsquo;t erase racism from his life and the exploration of how that racism would transform when people knew he was wealthy. I liked her nods to police brutality, and I liked that Luke was shown as actively working to combat that. I appreciated that she didn&rsquo;t only note the skin color of the people of color in the book, that is something that more white authors need to do; stop defaulting to white. Back to Luke: I now must go read some Batwing. I have dabbled in Batgirl, and know in comics they have a thing going on (or I think they do?) but am interested in expanding my knowledge. I also thought the way she handled PTSD added a lot to the story. I did want to know more about his life in Gotham outside of Batwing stuff. But I understand why that wasn\u2019t a bigger focus. And it isn\u2019t like we don\u2019t get any of his life outside of Batwing, I just wanted more, hense me heading to get Batwing comics soon.</p><p>I always love reading a bad-ass competent heroin. I also love 'finding your power/strength&rsquo; stories, but I do love entering a world with a person who is CAPABLE (which obviously Luke is as well, so we got this two-fold!). The story is not powered by Selina learning how to defeat the villains, it is powered by the super strong emotional core of the book. I love a good 'doing it all for the person I love&rsquo; story, especially when the person they love isn&rsquo;t a lover. Also, I loved that even when I was still putting together the pieces of how this was Maggie related, I could see that it was probably Maggie related somehow. The first chapter really lays the foundation very well.\u00a0</p><p>I loved Ivy! Me loving Ivy so much made he hope that Mor is going to have her sexuality handled well in future ACOTAR books.\u00a0</p><p>So I liked this book a lot. I again wish there were more DC Icon books to look forward to in the future, as of right now this is the end of the rode for me with this series, but it has certainly inspired me to seek out the comics. So good job DC, you got me.\u00a0</p><p>Last thing: the worst part about this book is the COVER. The kitten ears, the lame logo, the odd hair flare. It is just nowhere near the levels of awesome of the other three covers.</p><p>I gave this book five stars on Goodreads and finished reading it on March 14th, 2019.\u00a0</p>",
