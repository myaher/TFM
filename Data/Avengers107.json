What follows may be more than he was ready for.</p><p>*****</p><!-- more --><p>Steve woke when a loud thump sounded through the wall. He ran a hand down his face, a little groan leaving him. This was the fifth time this week! Sitting up he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, reaching for his cell phone and shooting a text off to the apartment manager.\u00a0</p><p>He tossed the phone to the side and dropped back.\u00a0</p><p>Not a second later he heard a muffled voice and the sound of a body hitting the wall. Steve shot up at the strangled cry of his neighbor, it sounded like she was being shoved into the wall. It took him a few seconds to drag on his sweats and less than a second to make it to the hallway outside his apartment and he was banging on the door before he could even think about what he was going to say.</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey I could hear you getting beat by your boyfriend.</i>\u2019\u00a0\u201c<i>Here to save the day!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Tun tun da daaa!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Puppy Power!</i>\u2019<br/></p><p>He shook his head and was surprised when he could hear her squeal and the shout,\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV! Get off! NOO!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve had to take a moment or he would break the god damned door down, what kind of man hit a woman?! Anger was already boiling through him when the door swung open and revealed his neighbor.</p><p>**</p><p>You shoved Gustav off demanding he let you answer the door before the manager could be called, and once more he threw himself at you, taking you down with ease before you managed to kick him off and stood straightening yourself out and ignoring the growl from behind you.</p><p>You had worked with worse male attitudes and could handle the small, yet heavy abuse you had been dealing with the last five days. The banging on the door was louder and moving quickly you caught hold of the door knob, swinging the door open before he could reach you again, holding out one hand behind you in a clear signal to behave.</p><p>You blinked.</p><p>\u201cSteve right?\u201d you asked attempting to keep a straight face and keep your eyes on his. Not let your eyes wander down to his shoulder, chest, holy fuck&hellip;. who made abs like that???\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Steve answered, making you snap your eyes back to his. Was he trying to see into your apartment?! He was!! He was craning his neck over you, which really it shouldn\u2019t be that hard as you literally were eye level with his nipples&hellip; Which made it harder for you to keep from staring at the bare chest in front of you, you had seen him of course. Who the fuck would miss that guy walking around <i>in clothes</i> and now here he stood half naked in front of you cause really those sweat pants were doing nothing to cover anything up and you were sure that they were being held up by jus-</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked sounding desperate.<br/></p><p>You blinked.\u00a0\u201ci- uh, what?\u201d</p><p>Baby blue eyes settled on yours and he frowned reaching out and catching your shoulders in his hands. Large hands you noted, god did he have any idea what he did to the female of the human species?! You were struggling to keep focus and you were certain that you were not the type to drool, well that was before he came over and stood in front of you naked&hellip;</p><p>\u201cListen if your boyfriend is hitting you, you don\u2019t have to put up with that. We can call the police and have them haul him away. I will stay and make sure he doesn\u2019t touch you till they arrive.\u201d<br/></p><p>\u201cMy?\u201d confusion kept you from speaking any further. Shaking your head you weren\u2019t sure if you were still sleeping or something had been intercommunicated.<br/></p><p>\u201cGustav?\u201d You blinked and looked over your shoulder, realization slamming into you as the tall blond adonis of your neighbor finally pressed by you.\u00a0\u201cListen here buddy, I don\u2019t know what kinda upbringing you had but you don\u2019t go around shoving women into walls&hellip;\u201d</p><p>You scrambled around him hands in front of you before he could react.\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV NOOO!!!\u201d you shouted as loudly as you could.</p><p>It was too late though, the grey pit bull had come bounding out of your room. Full speed ahead and you braced yourself for impact, when arms wrapped around you lifting you off your feet and pulling you to relative safety.\u00a0</p><p>The fully grown dog sliding across the well polished flooring and leaping onto your couch, turning and pinning you and Steve to the spot with its blue eyed stare. Laughter bubbled up as the dog huffed at you and settled onto the cushions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Gustav?\u201d<br/></p><p>You cringed, remembering you were being held close, thick strong arms wrapped around your waist, by your neighbor. The neighbor you had only managed to have enough time to barely say hi to every morning and evening.</p><p>Clearing your throat you peeked up at him over your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cyes.\u201d You answered and squirmed, he let out a small\u00a0\u2018oh\u2019, had the audacity to fucking blush. Hot and blushing? What. The. Fuck. Steve? You are outlawed, illegal, illegal substance. You nodded to yourself mentally. Illegal was a no-no and you kept you hands off and did not do illegal.</p><p>Do.</p><p>You would do him.</p><p>You groaned aloud and dropped your face to your hands.\u00a0\u201cSorry!\u201d you said loudly holding a hand up in his direction.</p><p>Steve looked down at the small hand that had landed firmly, yet blindly on his midsection. Nicely manicured nails, delicate fingers, but he could tell a firm grip. Looking back up at you he saw the horrified expression. Because you were touching him? Or was it because he had assumed you were being abused? God what an asshole!</p><p>\u201cIts not your fault, I can see,\u201d you pulled your hand from his midsection slowly as you spoke, somewhat hoping he wouldn\u2019t comment or notice,\u00a0\u201cI mean, I understand why you would assume&hellip; Gustav is somewhat abusive, but he doesn\u2019t mean it in a bad way. I know a lot of people have this bad view of pit bulls, but he really is such a huge sweet heart. He loves, like LOVES with all his being and that\u2019s why you&hellip; ohmifuckinggod!\u201d You gasp eyes wide. Steve freezes unsure of what your talking about and trying to keep up. You cringe as you realize why he\u2019s up.\u00a0\u201cI am so sorry! We woke you didn\u2019t we? See he\u2019s just so big! That\u2019s not an apology, I can by you coffee-for the week! Shit.. two weeks?!\u201d you held up two fingers smiling through a grimace.<br/></p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow at you.</p><p>\u201cIts not because I am trying to get a date with you. Not that I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d god this was getting worse by the second. Holy fuck he\u2019s smirking.\u00a0\u201cI MEAN!!\u201d you shrugged moving your hands to indicate his body, you could feel your ears burning, swallowing you begged what ever deities were up at this ungodly hour of four am to be merciful and help you shut your trap.\u00a0\u201cOBVIOUSLY, I mean.. I\u2019m sure plenty of gir-WOMEN!\u201d your brought your hand to your forehead in an audible smack.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. Please. Let me buy you coffee as a way of apology?\u201d FUCKING FINALLY!<br/></p><p>Steve covered his mouth, he had too otherwise he would laugh. The situation had somehow turned in his favor and he was struggling to keep from laughing at the absurdity of it.\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>You gasped and dropped your hands looking up at him with relief.\u00a0\u201cOh, fuck, thank you for not making this weirder!\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled, eyebrows raised,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll go get ready.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as he backed out the few steps into the hallway.\u00a0\u201cJ-just knock!\u201d</p><p>**</p><p>It took all of thirty minutes before he was knocking on your door again.</p><p>Opening the door you smiled up at hi,\u00a0\u201cOh, just a sec,\u201d turning back you hurried over to the couch where Gustav sat and dropped your forehead to his.\u00a0\u201cBe good, you have food, water and the toys. I know this is hard but I promise we will figure all of this out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched as you murmured to the dog, dropping a kiss to the dogs forehead before skipping back to the door, locking it behind you. A small smile curling the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d<br/></p><p>Steve shook his head, dropping his head and scratching the back of his neck. He let you take lead, eyes lingering on the door as he followed you down the hall to the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>A/N: sooooo, I have a lot of stories in the works, and no discernible schedule for them. I would apologize buuuutt, y\u2019all should be used to my fuckin insanity by now. I love you all. Anyhow. Idk when I will update this or how many parts there will be to it.\u00a0</p><p>Leave me comments?!?!</p><p>As always tags are open, send in an ask! Either perma (You get a tag for everything I post.

What follows may be more than he was ready for.</p><p>*****</p>[[MORE]]<p>Steve woke when a loud thump sounded through the wall. He ran a hand down his face, a little groan leaving him. This was the fifth time this week! Sitting up he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, reaching for his cell phone and shooting a text off to the apartment manager.\u00a0</p><p>He tossed the phone to the side and dropped back.\u00a0</p><p>Not a second later he heard a muffled voice and the sound of a body hitting the wall. Steve shot up at the strangled cry of his neighbor, it sounded like she was being shoved into the wall. It took him a few seconds to drag on his sweats and less than a second to make it to the hallway outside his apartment and he was banging on the door before he could even think about what he was going to say.</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey I could hear you getting beat by your boyfriend.</i>\u2019\u00a0\u201c<i>Here to save the day!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Tun tun da daaa!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Puppy Power!</i>\u2019<br></p><p>He shook his head and was surprised when he could hear her squeal and the shout,\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV! Get off! NOO!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve had to take a moment or he would break the god damned door down, what kind of man hit a woman?! Anger was already boiling through him when the door swung open and revealed his neighbor.</p><p>**</p><p>You shoved Gustav off demanding he let you answer the door before the manager could be called, and once more he threw himself at you, taking you down with ease before you managed to kick him off and stood straightening yourself out and ignoring the growl from behind you.</p><p>You had worked with worse male attitudes and could handle the small, yet heavy abuse you had been dealing with the last five days. The banging on the door was louder and moving quickly you caught hold of the door knob, swinging the door open before he could reach you again, holding out one hand behind you in a clear signal to behave.</p><p>You blinked.</p><p>\u201cSteve right?\u201d you asked attempting to keep a straight face and keep your eyes on his. Not let your eyes wander down to his shoulder, chest, holy fuck\u2026. who made abs like that???\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Steve answered, making you snap your eyes back to his. Was he trying to see into your apartment?! He was!! He was craning his neck over you, which really it shouldn\u2019t be that hard as you literally were eye level with his nipples\u2026 Which made it harder for you to keep from staring at the bare chest in front of you, you had seen him of course. Who the fuck would miss that guy walking around <i>in clothes</i> and now here he stood half naked in front of you cause really those sweat pants were doing nothing to cover anything up and you were sure that they were being held up by jus-</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked sounding desperate.<br></p><p>You blinked.\u00a0\u201ci- uh, what?\u201d</p><p>Baby blue eyes settled on yours and he frowned reaching out and catching your shoulders in his hands. Large hands you noted, god did he have any idea what he did to the female of the human species?! You were struggling to keep focus and you were certain that you were not the type to drool, well that was before he came over and stood in front of you naked\u2026</p><p>\u201cListen if your boyfriend is hitting you, you don\u2019t have to put up with that. We can call the police and have them haul him away. I will stay and make sure he doesn\u2019t touch you till they arrive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy?\u201d confusion kept you from speaking any further. Shaking your head you weren\u2019t sure if you were still sleeping or something had been intercommunicated.<br></p><p>\u201cGustav?\u201d You blinked and looked over your shoulder, realization slamming into you as the tall blond adonis of your neighbor finally pressed by you.\u00a0\u201cListen here buddy, I don\u2019t know what kinda upbringing you had but you don\u2019t go around shoving women into walls\u2026\u201d</p><p>You scrambled around him hands in front of you before he could react.\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV NOOO!!!\u201d you shouted as loudly as you could.</p><p>It was too late though, the grey pit bull had come bounding out of your room. Full speed ahead and you braced yourself for impact, when arms wrapped around you lifting you off your feet and pulling you to relative safety.\u00a0</p><p>The fully grown dog sliding across the well polished flooring and leaping onto your couch, turning and pinning you and Steve to the spot with its blue eyed stare. Laughter bubbled up as the dog huffed at you and settled onto the cushions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Gustav?\u201d<br></p><p>You cringed, remembering you were being held close, thick strong arms wrapped around your waist, by your neighbor. The neighbor you had only managed to have enough time to barely say hi to every morning and evening.</p><p>Clearing your throat you peeked up at him over your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cyes.\u201d You answered and squirmed, he let out a small\u00a0\u2018oh\u2019, had the audacity to fucking blush. Hot and blushing? What. The. Fuck. Steve? You are outlawed, illegal, illegal substance. You nodded to yourself mentally. Illegal was a no-no and you kept you hands off and did not do illegal.</p><p>Do.</p><p>You would do him.</p><p>You groaned aloud and dropped your face to your hands.\u00a0\u201cSorry!\u201d you said loudly holding a hand up in his direction.</p><p>Steve looked down at the small hand that had landed firmly, yet blindly on his midsection. Nicely manicured nails, delicate fingers, but he could tell a firm grip. Looking back up at you he saw the horrified expression. Because you were touching him? Or was it because he had assumed you were being abused? God what an asshole!</p><p>\u201cIts not your fault, I can see,\u201d you pulled your hand from his midsection slowly as you spoke, somewhat hoping he wouldn\u2019t comment or notice,\u00a0\u201cI mean, I understand why you would assume\u2026 Gustav is somewhat abusive, but he doesn\u2019t mean it in a bad way. I know a lot of people have this bad view of pit bulls, but he really is such a huge sweet heart. He loves, like LOVES with all his being and that\u2019s why you\u2026 ohmifuckinggod!\u201d You gasp eyes wide. Steve freezes unsure of what your talking about and trying to keep up. You cringe as you realize why he\u2019s up.\u00a0\u201cI am so sorry! We woke you didn\u2019t we? See he\u2019s just so big! That\u2019s not an apology, I can by you coffee-for the week! Shit.. two weeks?!\u201d you held up two fingers smiling through a grimace.<br></p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow at you.</p><p>\u201cIts not because I am trying to get a date with you. Not that I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d god this was getting worse by the second. Holy fuck he\u2019s smirking.\u00a0\u201cI MEAN!!\u201d you shrugged moving your hands to indicate his body, you could feel your ears burning, swallowing you begged what ever deities were up at this ungodly hour of four am to be merciful and help you shut your trap.\u00a0\u201cOBVIOUSLY, I mean.. I\u2019m sure plenty of gir-WOMEN!\u201d your brought your hand to your forehead in an audible smack.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. Please. Let me buy you coffee as a way of apology?\u201d FUCKING FINALLY!<br></p><p>Steve covered his mouth, he had too otherwise he would laugh. The situation had somehow turned in his favor and he was struggling to keep from laughing at the absurdity of it.\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>You gasped and dropped your hands looking up at him with relief.\u00a0\u201cOh, fuck, thank you for not making this weirder!\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled, eyebrows raised,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll go get ready.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as he backed out the few steps into the hallway.\u00a0\u201cJ-just knock!\u201d</p><p>**</p><p>It took all of thirty minutes before he was knocking on your door again.</p><p>Opening the door you smiled up at hi,\u00a0\u201cOh, just a sec,\u201d turning back you hurried over to the couch where Gustav sat and dropped your forehead to his.\u00a0\u201cBe good, you have food, water and the toys. I know this is hard but I promise we will figure all of this out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched as you murmured to the dog, dropping a kiss to the dogs forehead before skipping back to the door, locking it behind you. A small smile curling the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d<br></p><p>Steve shook his head, dropping his head and scratching the back of his neck. He let you take lead, eyes lingering on the door as he followed you down the hall to the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>A/N: sooooo, I have a lot of stories in the works, and no discernible schedule for them. I would apologize buuuutt, y\u2019all should be used to my fuckin insanity by now. I love you all. Anyhow. Idk when I will update this or how many parts there will be to it.\u00a0</p><p>Leave me comments?!?!</p><p>As always tags are open, send in an ask! Either perma (You get a tag for everything I post.

What follows may be more than he was ready for.</p><p>*****</p>[[MORE]]<p>Steve woke when a loud thump sounded through the wall. He ran a hand down his face, a little groan leaving him. This was the fifth time this week! Sitting up he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, reaching for his cell phone and shooting a text off to the apartment manager.\u00a0</p><p>He tossed the phone to the side and dropped back.\u00a0</p><p>Not a second later he heard a muffled voice and the sound of a body hitting the wall. Steve shot up at the strangled cry of his neighbor, it sounded like she was being shoved into the wall. It took him a few seconds to drag on his sweats and less than a second to make it to the hallway outside his apartment and he was banging on the door before he could even think about what he was going to say.</p><p>\u2018<i>Hey I could hear you getting beat by your boyfriend.</i>\u2019\u00a0\u201c<i>Here to save the day!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Tun tun da daaa!</i>\u2019\u00a0\u2018<i>Puppy Power!</i>\u2019<br></p><p>He shook his head and was surprised when he could hear her squeal and the shout,\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV! Get off! NOO!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve had to take a moment or he would break the god damned door down, what kind of man hit a woman?! Anger was already boiling through him when the door swung open and revealed his neighbor.</p><p>**</p><p>You shoved Gustav off demanding he let you answer the door before the manager could be called, and once more he threw himself at you, taking you down with ease before you managed to kick him off and stood straightening yourself out and ignoring the growl from behind you.</p><p>You had worked with worse male attitudes and could handle the small, yet heavy abuse you had been dealing with the last five days. The banging on the door was louder and moving quickly you caught hold of the door knob, swinging the door open before he could reach you again, holding out one hand behind you in a clear signal to behave.</p><p>You blinked.</p><p>\u201cSteve right?\u201d you asked attempting to keep a straight face and keep your eyes on his. Not let your eyes wander down to his shoulder, chest, holy fuck\u2026. who made abs like that???\u00a0<br></p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Steve answered, making you snap your eyes back to his. Was he trying to see into your apartment?! He was!! He was craning his neck over you, which really it shouldn\u2019t be that hard as you literally were eye level with his nipples\u2026 Which made it harder for you to keep from staring at the bare chest in front of you, you had seen him of course. Who the fuck would miss that guy walking around <i>in clothes</i> and now here he stood half naked in front of you cause really those sweat pants were doing nothing to cover anything up and you were sure that they were being held up by jus-</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked sounding desperate.<br></p><p>You blinked.\u00a0\u201ci- uh, what?\u201d</p><p>Baby blue eyes settled on yours and he frowned reaching out and catching your shoulders in his hands. Large hands you noted, god did he have any idea what he did to the female of the human species?! You were struggling to keep focus and you were certain that you were not the type to drool, well that was before he came over and stood in front of you naked\u2026</p><p>\u201cListen if your boyfriend is hitting you, you don\u2019t have to put up with that. We can call the police and have them haul him away. I will stay and make sure he doesn\u2019t touch you till they arrive.\u201d<br></p><p>\u201cMy?\u201d confusion kept you from speaking any further. Shaking your head you weren\u2019t sure if you were still sleeping or something had been intercommunicated.<br></p><p>\u201cGustav?\u201d You blinked and looked over your shoulder, realization slamming into you as the tall blond adonis of your neighbor finally pressed by you.\u00a0\u201cListen here buddy, I don\u2019t know what kinda upbringing you had but you don\u2019t go around shoving women into walls\u2026\u201d</p><p>You scrambled around him hands in front of you before he could react.\u00a0\u201cGUSTAV NOOO!!!\u201d you shouted as loudly as you could.</p><p>It was too late though, the grey pit bull had come bounding out of your room. Full speed ahead and you braced yourself for impact, when arms wrapped around you lifting you off your feet and pulling you to relative safety.\u00a0</p><p>The fully grown dog sliding across the well polished flooring and leaping onto your couch, turning and pinning you and Steve to the spot with its blue eyed stare. Laughter bubbled up as the dog huffed at you and settled onto the cushions.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis is Gustav?\u201d<br></p><p>You cringed, remembering you were being held close, thick strong arms wrapped around your waist, by your neighbor. The neighbor you had only managed to have enough time to barely say hi to every morning and evening.</p><p>Clearing your throat you peeked up at him over your shoulder,\u00a0\u201cyes.\u201d You answered and squirmed, he let out a small\u00a0\u2018oh\u2019, had the audacity to fucking blush. Hot and blushing? What. The. Fuck. Steve? You are outlawed, illegal, illegal substance. You nodded to yourself mentally. Illegal was a no-no and you kept you hands off and did not do illegal.</p><p>Do.</p><p>You would do him.</p><p>You groaned aloud and dropped your face to your hands.\u00a0\u201cSorry!\u201d you said loudly holding a hand up in his direction.</p><p>Steve looked down at the small hand that had landed firmly, yet blindly on his midsection. Nicely manicured nails, delicate fingers, but he could tell a firm grip. Looking back up at you he saw the horrified expression. Because you were touching him? Or was it because he had assumed you were being abused? God what an asshole!</p><p>\u201cIts not your fault, I can see,\u201d you pulled your hand from his midsection slowly as you spoke, somewhat hoping he wouldn\u2019t comment or notice,\u00a0\u201cI mean, I understand why you would assume\u2026 Gustav is somewhat abusive, but he doesn\u2019t mean it in a bad way. I know a lot of people have this bad view of pit bulls, but he really is such a huge sweet heart. He loves, like LOVES with all his being and that\u2019s why you\u2026 ohmifuckinggod!\u201d You gasp eyes wide. Steve freezes unsure of what your talking about and trying to keep up. You cringe as you realize why he\u2019s up.\u00a0\u201cI am so sorry! We woke you didn\u2019t we? See he\u2019s just so big! That\u2019s not an apology, I can by you coffee-for the week! Shit.. two weeks?!\u201d you held up two fingers smiling through a grimace.<br></p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow at you.</p><p>\u201cIts not because I am trying to get a date with you. Not that I wouldn\u2019t!\u201d god this was getting worse by the second. Holy fuck he\u2019s smirking.\u00a0\u201cI MEAN!!\u201d you shrugged moving your hands to indicate his body, you could feel your ears burning, swallowing you begged what ever deities were up at this ungodly hour of four am to be merciful and help you shut your trap.\u00a0\u201cOBVIOUSLY, I mean.. I\u2019m sure plenty of gir-WOMEN!\u201d your brought your hand to your forehead in an audible smack.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. Please. Let me buy you coffee as a way of apology?\u201d FUCKING FINALLY!<br></p><p>Steve covered his mouth, he had too otherwise he would laugh. The situation had somehow turned in his favor and he was struggling to keep from laughing at the absurdity of it.\u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>You gasped and dropped your hands looking up at him with relief.\u00a0\u201cOh, fuck, thank you for not making this weirder!\u201d</p><p>Steve smiled, eyebrows raised,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll go get ready.\u201d</p><p>You nodded as he backed out the few steps into the hallway.\u00a0\u201cJ-just knock!\u201d</p><p>**</p><p>It took all of thirty minutes before he was knocking on your door again.</p><p>Opening the door you smiled up at hi,\u00a0\u201cOh, just a sec,\u201d turning back you hurried over to the couch where Gustav sat and dropped your forehead to his.\u00a0\u201cBe good, you have food, water and the toys. I know this is hard but I promise we will figure all of this out!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Steve watched as you murmured to the dog, dropping a kiss to the dogs forehead before skipping back to the door, locking it behind you. A small smile curling the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d<br></p><p>Steve shook his head, dropping his head and scratching the back of his neck. He let you take lead, eyes lingering on the door as he followed you down the hall to the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>A/N: sooooo, I have a lot of stories in the works, and no discernible schedule for them. I would apologize buuuutt, y\u2019all should be used to my fuckin insanity by now. I love you all. Anyhow. Idk when I will update this or how many parts there will be to it.\u00a0</p><p>Leave me comments?!?!</p><p>As always tags are open, send in an ask! Either perma (You get a tag for everything I post.

What follows may be more than he was ready for.</p><p>*****</p><p>Steve woke when a loud thump sounded through the wall. He ran a hand down his face, a little groan leaving him. This was the fifth time this week! Sitting up he swung his legs over the edge of the bed, reaching for his cell phone and shooting a text off to the apartment manager.&nbsp;</p><p>He tossed the phone to the side and dropped back.&nbsp;</p><p>Not a second later he heard a muffled voice and the sound of a body hitting the wall. Steve shot up at the strangled cry of his neighbor, it sounded like she was being shoved into the wall. It took him a few seconds to drag on his sweats and less than a second to make it to the hallway outside his apartment and he was banging on the door before he could even think about what he was going to say.</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Hey I could hear you getting beat by your boyfriend.</i>&rsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Here to save the day!</i>&rsquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>Tun tun da daaa!</i>&rsquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>Puppy Power!</i>&rsquo;<br /></p><p>He shook his head and was surprised when he could hear her squeal and the shout,&nbsp;&ldquo;GUSTAV! Get off! NOO!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve had to take a moment or he would break the god damned door down, what kind of man hit a woman?! Anger was already boiling through him when the door swung open and revealed his neighbor.</p><p>**</p><p>You shoved Gustav off demanding he let you answer the door before the manager could be called, and once more he threw himself at you, taking you down with ease before you managed to kick him off and stood straightening yourself out and ignoring the growl from behind you.</p><p>You had worked with worse male attitudes and could handle the small, yet heavy abuse you had been dealing with the last five days. The banging on the door was louder and moving quickly you caught hold of the door knob, swinging the door open before he could reach you again, holding out one hand behind you in a clear signal to behave.</p><p>You blinked.</p><p>&ldquo;Steve right?&rdquo; you asked attempting to keep a straight face and keep your eyes on his. Not let your eyes wander down to his shoulder, chest, holy fuck&hellip;. who made abs like that???&nbsp;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Steve answered, making you snap your eyes back to his. Was he trying to see into your apartment?! He was!! He was craning his neck over you, which really it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard as you literally were eye level with his nipples&hellip; Which made it harder for you to keep from staring at the bare chest in front of you, you had seen him of course. Who the fuck would miss that guy walking around <i>in clothes</i> and now here he stood half naked in front of you cause really those sweat pants were doing nothing to cover anything up and you were sure that they were being held up by jus-</p><p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he asked sounding desperate.<br /></p><p>You blinked.&nbsp;&ldquo;i- uh, what?&rdquo;</p><p>Baby blue eyes settled on yours and he frowned reaching out and catching your shoulders in his hands. Large hands you noted, god did he have any idea what he did to the female of the human species?! You were struggling to keep focus and you were certain that you were not the type to drool, well that was before he came over and stood in front of you naked&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen if your boyfriend is hitting you, you don&rsquo;t have to put up with that. We can call the police and have them haul him away. I will stay and make sure he doesn&rsquo;t touch you till they arrive.&rdquo;<br /></p><p>&ldquo;My?&rdquo; confusion kept you from speaking any further. Shaking your head you weren&rsquo;t sure if you were still sleeping or something had been intercommunicated.<br /></p><p>&ldquo;Gustav?&rdquo; You blinked and looked over your shoulder, realization slamming into you as the tall blond adonis of your neighbor finally pressed by you.&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen here buddy, I don&rsquo;t know what kinda upbringing you had but you don&rsquo;t go around shoving women into walls&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>You scrambled around him hands in front of you before he could react.&nbsp;&ldquo;GUSTAV NOOO!!!&rdquo; you shouted as loudly as you could.</p><p>It was too late though, the grey pit bull had come bounding out of your room. Full speed ahead and you braced yourself for impact, when arms wrapped around you lifting you off your feet and pulling you to relative safety.&nbsp;</p><p>The fully grown dog sliding across the well polished flooring and leaping onto your couch, turning and pinning you and Steve to the spot with its blue eyed stare. Laughter bubbled up as the dog huffed at you and settled onto the cushions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This is Gustav?&rdquo;<br /></p><p>You cringed, remembering you were being held close, thick strong arms wrapped around your waist, by your neighbor. The neighbor you had only managed to have enough time to barely say hi to every morning and evening.</p><p>Clearing your throat you peeked up at him over your shoulder,&nbsp;&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; You answered and squirmed, he let out a small&nbsp;&lsquo;oh&rsquo;, had the audacity to fucking blush. Hot and blushing? What. The. Fuck. Steve? You are outlawed, illegal, illegal substance. You nodded to yourself mentally. Illegal was a no-no and you kept you hands off and did not do illegal.</p><p>Do.</p><p>You would do him.</p><p>You groaned aloud and dropped your face to your hands.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; you said loudly holding a hand up in his direction.</p><p>Steve looked down at the small hand that had landed firmly, yet blindly on his midsection. Nicely manicured nails, delicate fingers, but he could tell a firm grip. Looking back up at you he saw the horrified expression. Because you were touching him? Or was it because he had assumed you were being abused? God what an asshole!</p><p>&ldquo;Its not your fault, I can see,&rdquo; you pulled your hand from his midsection slowly as you spoke, somewhat hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t comment or notice,&nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I understand why you would assume&hellip; Gustav is somewhat abusive, but he doesn&rsquo;t mean it in a bad way. I know a lot of people have this bad view of pit bulls, but he really is such a huge sweet heart. He loves, like LOVES with all his being and that&rsquo;s why you&hellip; ohmifuckinggod!&rdquo; You gasp eyes wide. Steve freezes unsure of what your talking about and trying to keep up. You cringe as you realize why he&rsquo;s up.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am so sorry! We woke you didn&rsquo;t we? See he&rsquo;s just so big! That&rsquo;s not an apology, I can by you coffee-for the week! Shit.. two weeks?!&rdquo; you held up two fingers smiling through a grimace.<br /></p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow at you.</p><p>&ldquo;Its not because I am trying to get a date with you. Not that I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; god this was getting worse by the second. Holy fuck he&rsquo;s smirking.&nbsp;&ldquo;I MEAN!!&rdquo; you shrugged moving your hands to indicate his body, you could feel your ears burning, swallowing you begged what ever deities were up at this ungodly hour of four am to be merciful and help you shut your trap.&nbsp;&ldquo;OBVIOUSLY, I mean.. I&rsquo;m sure plenty of gir-WOMEN!&rdquo; your brought your hand to your forehead in an audible smack.</p><p>&ldquo;I am so sorry. Please. Let me buy you coffee as a way of apology?&rdquo; FUCKING FINALLY!<br /></p><p>Steve covered his mouth, he had too otherwise he would laugh. The situation had somehow turned in his favor and he was struggling to keep from laughing at the absurdity of it.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>You gasped and dropped your hands looking up at him with relief.&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, fuck, thank you for not making this weirder!&rdquo;</p><p>Steve smiled, eyebrows raised,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get ready.&rdquo;</p><p>You nodded as he backed out the few steps into the hallway.&nbsp;&ldquo;J-just knock!&rdquo;</p><p>**</p><p>It took all of thirty minutes before he was knocking on your door again.</p><p>Opening the door you smiled up at hi,&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, just a sec,&rdquo; turning back you hurried over to the couch where Gustav sat and dropped your forehead to his.&nbsp;&ldquo;Be good, you have food, water and the toys. I know this is hard but I promise we will figure all of this out!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve watched as you murmured to the dog, dropping a kiss to the dogs forehead before skipping back to the door, locking it behind you. A small smile curling the corners of his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo;<br /></p><p>Steve shook his head, dropping his head and scratching the back of his neck. He let you take lead, eyes lingering on the door as he followed you down the hall to the elevator.</p><p>***</p><p>A/N: sooooo, I have a lot of stories in the works, and no discernible schedule for them. I would apologize buuuutt, y&rsquo;all should be used to my fuckin insanity by now. I love you all. Anyhow. Idk when I will update this or how many parts there will be to it.&nbsp;</p><p>Leave me comments?!?!</p><p>As always tags are open, send in an ask! Either perma (You get a tag for everything I post.
