There is literally no previous scene that you can compare his rage too. When that scene came out and after season 7 aired there were a lot of people who were not only upset about the writing in season 7, but specifically upset about that particular scene with Jon. Many believed that Jon\u2019s reaction to Littlefinger was so out of character and that it didn\u2019t make sense for Jon to react so violently to Littlefinger. Also many people thought it was an injustice to Littlefinger. For a character as smart and strategic as he was people couldn\u2019t wrap their mind around why he would blantanly provoke Jon and reveal his feelings for Sansa.

Yes, Jon is protective of Sansa but based on the Jon we\u2019ve seen in the show, his reaction was abnormal and extremely out of character. Also Littlefinger isn\u2019t usually so blatant with his manipulations and emotions. He\u2019s usually pretty tactful. With that being said, that\u2019s why I think this scene was the biggest tell-tale sign that Jon has deeper feelings for Sansa than he realizes. Make no mistake, the crypt scene was not filler for season 7! Littlefinger wasn\u2019t just \u201cpoking the bear\u201d for no reason. I believe that scene was created to further push this story along to where it will eventually lead. The purpose of that scene wasn\u2019t to highlight the danger/threat of Littlefinger to Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. We knew Littlefinger was a threat from season 6. The purpose of this scene was to <b>REVEAL</b> feelings/weaknesses hidden underneath the surface. Jon\u2019s violent reaction was the entire point of that scene. It was something that we as an audience were immediately supposed to take notice of. </p><p>Another point that I want to mention is this. In the history of this show have you ever seen Littlefinger look confused?! Have you ever seen him look bewildered like he didn\u2019t know what just happened? His excecution aside, Littlefinger has definitely been caught off guard before but he\u2019s never had a look of confusion. He usually has the upper hand in scenes often manipulating the individual he\u2019s speaking to and privy to their secrets. But this time around in this particular scene that wasn\u2019t the case. For the first time Littlefinger seems dumbfounded by the events that occurred until \u201csomething\u201d dawns on him and he stares at Sansa.</p>",

Mind you, a lot of awful shit has happened to Jon in the past seven seasons of Game of Thrones but Jon has NEVER reacted so violently to anyone else in the show! There is literally no previous scene that you can compare his rage too. When that scene came out and after season 7 aired there were a lot of people who were not only upset about the writing in season 7, but specifically upset about that particular scene with Jon. Many believed that Jon\u2019s reaction to Littlefinger was so out of character and that it didn\u2019t make sense for Jon to react so violently to Littlefinger. Also many people thought it was an injustice to Littlefinger. For a character as smart and strategic as he was people couldn\u2019t wrap their mind around why he would blantanly provoke Jon and reveal his feelings for Sansa. They couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to accomplish.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"ladyandtheghost:MA1Kre0_RQH0U_q4y-PIBg:ZIr4Nd2OADeBT\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22df289cab8935f510dc0feeb480065/tumblr_otm5ctK5jE1wv7r96o1_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"302\" data-orig-width=\"500\"></figure><p>The funny thing is that the criticism this scene has received is ABSOLUTELY VALID! Yes, Jon is protective of Sansa but based on the Jon we\u2019ve seen in the show, his reaction was abnormal and extremely out of character. Also Littlefinger isn\u2019t usually so blatant with his manipulations and emotions. He\u2019s usually pretty tactful. With that being said, that\u2019s why I think this scene was the biggest tell-tale sign that Jon has deeper feelings for Sansa than he realizes. Make no mistake, the crypt scene was not filler for season 7! Littlefinger wasn\u2019t just \u201cpoking the bear\u201d for no reason. I believe that scene was created to further push this story along to where it will eventually lead. The purpose of that scene wasn\u2019t to highlight the danger/threat of Littlefinger to Jon and Sansa\u2019s relationship. We knew Littlefinger was a threat from season 6. The purpose of this scene was to <b>REVEAL</b> feelings/weaknesses hidden underneath the surface. Jon\u2019s violent reaction was the entire point of that scene. It was something that we as an audience were immediately supposed to take notice of. </p><p>Another point that I want to mention is this. In the history of this show have you ever seen Littlefinger look confused?! Have you ever seen him look bewildered like he didn\u2019t know what just happened? His excecution aside, Littlefinger has definitely been caught off guard before but he\u2019s never had a look of confusion. He usually has the upper hand in scenes often manipulating the individual he\u2019s speaking to and privy to their secrets. But this time around in this particular scene that wasn\u2019t the case. For the first time Littlefinger seems dumbfounded by the events that occurred until \u201csomething\u201d dawns on him and he stares at Sansa.</p>",

Well, I actually came up with it two hours ago and I\u2019m curious about what you may think about this theory. So, let&rsquo;s jump right in.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p><p>\u201cThere must always be a Stark in Winterfell.\u201d But why?\u00a0</p><p>We have heard this particular line plenty of times over the past seven seasons and for some reason, it has always stuck with me. Not because it is not the official Stark motto and was still used frequently, but because of the seriousness with which it is always uttered.</p><p>Lately, I have been re-watching the TV series and the way Catelyn Stark says it, with a grave face and in with a serious tone, it makes me wonder if there is a deeper significance to it than it just being a mere belief or a good luck charm.\u00a0</p><p>I mean, we all have beliefs and our families have certain customs and traditions that are being followed for generations but traditions may change after a long time, say after 100, 200 or 300 years if the descendants of the family feel that the traditions do not go hand-in-hand with the way society works.\u00a0</p><p>House Stark is one of the oldest houses of Westeros, founded by Brandon \u2018The Builder\u2019 Stark sometime after the first Long Night. Yet even 1000s of years later, the words are still significant and are uttered in a way as though lives depend on it.\u00a0</p><h2><b><i>Does it have anything to do with the White Walker and the Night King?\u00a0</i></b></h2><p>We know that Brandon the Builder overlooked the construction of the Wall and Winterfell after the Long Night. The Wall was created with the help of the Children of the Forest who used some kind of magic to restrict the dead to the north of the Wall.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But I wonder if they did it on their own accord. Or were they asked for help?</p><p>What if the Children were asked for help by Brandon the Builder? Brandon must have known about the magical gifts the Children posses. What if he asked them to help him construct the wall?</p><p>Well, we know that the Wall does possess magical properties and so the Children definitely helped. But did they entirely?</p><p>I believe that they cursed House Stark and Winterfell in the weirdest way which only restricted them from taking family vacations.</p><p>Remember that the Wall was made after the Long Night while The Pact between the Children and the First Men was made some 4000 years earlier- the Pact which was signed after a brutal war between the children and the first men.\u00a0A war which, though I\u2019m not sure, probably made the children fear extinction. How can I say that? Well, I do believe that when the Children created the Night King, it was their last major move, the last ace up their sleeves. So they must be losing at the time and probably got reduced in number.\u00a0</p><p>Come the Long Night, that number would have gone down even further when compared to the First Men\u2019s population. So, I believe that when Brandon Stark, a descendant of the First Men, asked the Children to help construct the wall, a move which would have ensured the First Men\u2019s survival for ages to come, they got angry at the thought of it.</p><p>Because even though a pact was signed, Brandon\u2019s ancestors did kill the Children\u2019s ancestors and so maybe it offended them that Brandon asked them for help to ensure the safety of &lsquo;his&rsquo; people. So they helped Brandon in creating the wall, but they also cursed him and his family and their home in Winterfell. Maybe just out of spite.\u00a0</p><p>What was the curse?\u00a0</p><h2><b><i>I believe that they did some magic on the Wall and linked it to Winterfell and the Stark bloodline in a way that if the Starks ever left Winterfell, the magic done on the Wall would be undone and the dead would be able to pass.</i></b>\u00a0 \u00a0</h2><p>Because to be honest, in a situation of the Starks ever leaving Winterfell and the dead returning, it would have meant the extinction of the Children, but more importantly for them, it would have meant the extinction of the civilisation which destroyed theirs. It could have been a move just out of a feeling of revenge. There may not have been many children left after the Long Night and so their loss would not have been anywhere as much as the First Men\u2019s descendants.\u00a0</p><p>I believe that the FM\u2019s extinction would have served the Children\u2019s ego well as their extinction would have come because of them, the beings that they wanted to finish in the first place.</p><p>But then how did the words,\u00a0\u201cThere must always be a Stark in Winterfell\u201d happened? Why would the Children give up the secret to their magic?\u00a0</p><p>Maybe because their consciousness didn\u2019t allow them to just walk away without warning the Starks. Or maybe they just wanted to rub it in the Starks\u2019 face that if the dead ever come back, it would be because of them.</p><p>But then, you could ask, why did we see the WW in the first episode? The Starks were still in Winterfell, the magic would have still been there.</p><p>Well, there is a wide belief that the NK can see in the past and in the future like Bran. We\u2019ve not see Bran see the future yet but I believe that the NK must have more powers and also more control over those powers in comparison to a semi-pro Three-Eyed-Raven. So he would have known for a long time that all the Starks would eventually leave Winterfell under different circumstances.\u00a0</p><p>And he was waiting, ready to strike!</p>",

Not because it is not the official Stark motto and was still used frequently, but because of the seriousness with which it is always uttered.</p><p>Lately, I have been re-watching the TV series and the way Catelyn Stark says it, with a grave face and in with a serious tone, it makes me wonder if there is a deeper significance to it than it just being a mere belief or a good luck charm.\u00a0</p><p>I mean, we all have beliefs and our families have certain customs and traditions that are being followed for generations but traditions may change after a long time, say after 100, 200 or 300 years if the descendants of the family feel that the traditions do not go hand-in-hand with the way society works.\u00a0</p><p>House Stark is one of the oldest houses of Westeros, founded by Brandon \u2018The Builder\u2019 Stark sometime after the first Long Night. Yet even 1000s of years later, the words are still significant and are uttered in a way as though lives depend on it.\u00a0</p><h2><b><i>Does it have anything to do with the White Walker and the Night King?\u00a0</i></b></h2><p>We know that Brandon the Builder overlooked the construction of the Wall and Winterfell after the Long Night. The Wall was created with the help of the Children of the Forest who used some kind of magic to restrict the dead to the north of the Wall.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>But I wonder if they did it on their own accord. Or were they asked for help?</p><p>What if the Children were asked for help by Brandon the Builder? Brandon must have known about the magical gifts the Children posses. What if he asked them to help him construct the wall?</p><p>Well, we know that the Wall does possess magical properties and so the Children definitely helped. But did they entirely?</p><p>I believe that they cursed House Stark and Winterfell in the weirdest way which only restricted them from taking family vacations.</p><p>Remember that the Wall was made after the Long Night while The Pact between the Children and the First Men was made some 4000 years earlier- the Pact which was signed after a brutal war between the children and the first men.\u00a0A war which, though I\u2019m not sure, probably made the children fear extinction. How can I say that? Well, I do believe that when the Children created the Night King, it was their last major move, the last ace up their sleeves. So they must be losing at the time and probably got reduced in number.\u00a0</p><p>Come the Long Night, that number would have gone down even further when compared to the First Men\u2019s population. So, I believe that when Brandon Stark, a descendant of the First Men, asked the Children to help construct the wall, a move which would have ensured the First Men\u2019s survival for ages to come, they got angry at the thought of it.</p><p>Because even though a pact was signed, Brandon\u2019s ancestors did kill the Children\u2019s ancestors and so maybe it offended them that Brandon asked them for help to ensure the safety of \u2018his\u2019 people. So they helped Brandon in creating the wall, but they also cursed him and his family and their home in Winterfell.

Do you see what you do to me\u2026\u201d</p><p>He babbled an incoherent response as his fingers started moving on his own, playing with the secret place between her sister\u2019s legs at the same time she pulled down his zipper and freed his aching manhood.</p><p>\u201cFuck Sansa\u201d He bit her shoulder when he felt her stroking him perfectly, then her lips found his ear and she bit into it softly, his blood tingling with the need to possess and at the same time an angry though came to his mind \u201cHave you done this before- who the fuck-\u201c</p><p>She chuckled \u201cNo one, you\u2019re the only. You\u2019ll always be the only\u201d She released his cock and fell back on the bed once again, her legs open and her nipples standing up towards him \u201cI want you to be the first Jon\u201d She whispered as she took her hands to her cunt and opened her lips in an almost obscene way.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t\u201d He muttered even as he lowered down his body on top of her, his eyes fixed on the wetness that was dripping from between her legs, the fiery red of her curls entrancing him.</p><p>A look full of desire crossed her face \u201cBut we want to, we need to\u201d</p><p>Without another word of encouragement Jon\u2019s mouth went to her cunt and he started devouring her, cries muffled against the pillows as he brought her to completion.</p><p>He took her virginity that night and ran away the next day; in the four years he was away at college he never called her or answered her texts and only visited when he knew she wasn\u2019t going to be at the house, because he was ashamed, because what he did was a sin greater than anything he had ever done, because he had ruined her and because there was nothing he desired more than be lost in her once again.</p><p>So he disappeared.</p><p>And now he was back, after four years he heading to his parents\u2019 home knowing fully well that dear Sansa was inside. But he would be strong this time, he would ask for forgiveness and for the chance to have things the way they were. </p><p>He would ask for his little sister back.</p><p>\u201cJon, I think we\u2019re about to land\u201d The sweet voice of his girlfriend brought him back from that dark trance had been in, he smiled gently at her and touched one strand of her almost silver hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to meet them Danny\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him \u201cI have a good feeling; I think they\u2019ll love me\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled at her and tried to ignore the uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach, because he wasn\u2019t sure everyone was going to love her.</p>",
