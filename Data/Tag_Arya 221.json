But real problem is that they changed the actual dynamic of Arya and her role and relationships in the stark family. You can see that in the bow scene as well, with arya shooting the bow and everybody laughing and kind of being supportive? In the books, Catelyn would have been furious and would have dragged her right back to Septa Mordane, and Ned wouldnt be approving at all (despite how much he loves Arya, he is still a traditional man with a traditional mindset and a young noble girl with a bow without permission is a big no no.) This is actually very important because the whole concept is that despite how wild Arya is, it\u2019s not approved by anyone and she is expected to behave in a certain way\u00a0 and it plays a very important part in her characterisation (her self-consciousness, her feeling of being an outcast, her need to belong, her lack of self-confidence and self-worth). The same thing happens in the food scene. Arya throws food at her old sister, in a feast filled with the noble men and the royal family, during a royal visit and seconds after her sister just spoke with queen, is so unrealistic. It\u2019s supposed to be this sweet family moment where we see Arya being mischievous, and show how everyone finds it funny, but in the books, Arya first wouldnt dare (girl might not be one for rules but she at least tries to behave herself, especially when she knows her butt is going to be handed to her if she doesnt). And Arya really isnt that kind of person. She is more play in the mud despite being told not to, and sneak to the older kid\u2019s kind of mischievous. And if she is rude, its probably warranted. In that scene, Sansa and Arya werent even interacting and the food throwing was completely unwarranted. I mean, its not even a big deal, but it can be seen as\u00a0\u201cbullying\u201d and generally something mean, and makes Sansa seem more of an outcast and a target than Arya (which is <b>NOT</b> the case). And they also cut out the part Sansa played in their relationship (horseface,\u00a0\u201cugly as hodor\u201d,\u00a0\u201cthey should have killed you instead of Lady\u201d) in order to make Sansa more likable. So in response to your question, kind of but its more complicated (?) than that.\u00a0</p><p>I actually saw a post (i think it was by gendrie or someone else) that explained this quite well.

It is simultaneously the most ironic and saddest situation in the series for me.\u00a0</p><p>In the beginning of this series Jeyne is Sansa\u2019s best friend\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>If only she had someone to tell her what to do. She missed Septa Mordane, and even more <b>Jeyne</b> Poole,<b> her truest</b> <b>friend</b>.</i>\u201d - Sansa II, ACoK\u00a0<br/></p><p>\n\n\u201c<i>Joffrey likes your sister,&ldquo; <b>Jeyne</b> <b>whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell&rsquo;s steward and Sansa&rsquo;s dearest friend</b>. &quot;He told her she was very beautiful.</i>\u201d - Arya I, GoT<br/></p><p>And Arya\u2019s childhood bully\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. <b>Jeyne</b> <b>used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near</b>. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse.</i>\u201d - Arya I, GoT<br/></p><p>\u201c<i>They&rsquo;d been her friends, she&rsquo;d felt safe around them, but now she knew that was a lie. They&rsquo;d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. <b>Jeyne</b> <b>Poole had told Arya that he&rsquo;d cut him up in so many pieces that they&rsquo;d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they&rsquo;d slaughtered</b>. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father.</i>\u201d - Arya II, GoT<br/></p><p>It is with Arya that the irony kicks in. Jeyne Poole seems to look down on Arya and i think envies her place a little. Arya Horseface, who is scrawny and plain and cannot do anything but sums right, is one day going to be a Lady and rule a castle. As we know it is not really realistic for Jeyne Poole to get herself a Lord.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c<i>I suppose,&rdquo; Sansa said doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but he was awfully old, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of course, <b>Jeyne</b> <b>had been in love with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in the lists.
