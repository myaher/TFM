When I placed them back, my eyes drifted to the dog tag hung around the blonde&rsquo;s neck, similar to the ones I&rsquo;d seen some of the Air Force guys wearing around Pancho&rsquo;s the past few days. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re in the Air Force,&rdquo; I blurted out accidentally. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blonde met my eyes and gave me a confused smile. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kind of having to follow through with what I was saying, I nodded to her dog tag. &ldquo;The dog tag. Air Force, right? From the base near here?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled and nodded. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s really cool,&ldquo; I said, smiling impressively. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You think?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Well, yeah,&ldquo; I said, sure of myself. &quot;I mean, you must be doing something you love, even with all of these&hellip;&rdquo; I looked around the bar, at all the obnoxious, self-righteous men who were also part of the Air Force, &ldquo;&hellip;<i>obstacles</i> in the way.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blonde laughed and I smiled at the sound. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I guess,&ldquo; she said with a shrug, taking a sip of her beer before nodding to me. &quot;What about you, though? Surely you&rsquo;re doing something you love?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I snickered, leaning back against the counter behind me. &ldquo;More like the only thing I&rsquo;m good at.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I challenged her expression with a humoured smile. &ldquo;Well, my dad was an alcoholic, so yeah, the only thing I&rsquo;m pretty much good at is preparing drinks.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blonde raised her eyebrows, surprised. &ldquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved her off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s something to joke about.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stranger straightened up, leaning forward as she stared up at me with hopeful eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you could do something more if you put your mind to it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;m saving up for something, but I don&rsquo;t know what yet.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, her eyes squinting gorgeously. &ldquo;There you go then.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I returned the smile, a newfound interest developing in this complete stranger who I&rsquo;d somehow just shared parts of my life with that nobody really knew. My eyes flickered down to her dog tag, which I found intriguing, and I stood up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Can I see it?&ldquo; I asked curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She realised I was looking at her dog tag and nodded, saying, &quot;Sure,&rdquo; before pulling it from around her neck and holding it out for me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled excitedly and took it from her, leaning on the bar in front of her and studying it closely. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Carol Danvers,&ldquo; I read aloud, before looking up, a little surprised to see her hazel eyes studying me closely. &quot;Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I handed it back to her, watching as she pulled it around her neck and lifted her hair that was caught. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You, too&hellip;,&ldquo; she said, before raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N Y/L/N,&rdquo; I filled in, standing up with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N Y/L/N,&ldquo; she repeated, and I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it then, but my name sounded good coming from her lips. &quot;You&rsquo;re new here, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;As of a few days ago,&ldquo; I said, before jokingly adding, &quot;They just couldn&rsquo;t resist my amazing drink-making skills.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, can I get a drink over here?!&ldquo; someone called from the other end of the bar, ruining the moment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Duty calls,&rdquo; I mumbled, giving Carol one last smile before leaving to serve another customer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of my shift that evening wasn&rsquo;t as bad compared to the past few days, since Carol and her friend, Maria, were there to keep me company. It was nice to be able to talk to customers who weren&rsquo;t checking me out or flirting with me whilst half-drunk. Plus, they were lovely ladies who were <i>amazingly </i>cool pilots. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two women stopped by quite frequently and I learnt they were regulars, as were most of their team on the Air Force. It was fun talking to them when they came every few evenings, and I was beginning to look forward to their arrival when they came since they made my shift a whole lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Carol, who I was growing fond of. She was funny and confident and I was trying ever so hard to figure out if she was into girls or not, because there were moments - glances or little touches - between us that felt more than &lsquo;friendly&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want to assume though, so I never really pursued it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was one evening when it wasn&rsquo;t that busy and Carol and Maria were there, keeping me company. We were talking about whether it was better going out to watch a film or to rent one and stay in - silly, but that&rsquo;s what we happened to be talking about. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;We should get going,&ldquo; Maria said, checking the time on her watch. &quot;Monica&rsquo;s babysitter leaves at eight.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monica was Maria&rsquo;s kid, whom she&rsquo;d mentioned countless times. I&rsquo;d never met her, but she sounded adorable by the way her and Carol described her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys again!&ldquo; I said with a smile, watching as Maria got up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Er, is it cool if I stay for a little longer? I&rsquo;ll catch the bus home,&rdquo; Carol said, looking up at Maria. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was happening, but after a few exchanged glances between them both, Maria nodded, smiling at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Okay, I&rsquo;ll see you later, Carol. See ya, Y/N!&ldquo; she said, waving at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye and watched her leave before looking to Carol with a teasing smile. &quot;Are my ever-so-interesting topics of conversation too much for you to resist that you chose to stay, Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol bit her lip to contain her laugh. &ldquo;Yeah. You nailed it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her choosing to stay that evening told me all I needed to know - she was interested. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was wiping the empty tables down with a cloth when I heard the front door open. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, Carol,&ldquo; Pancho, the owner, called from the bar, &quot;good to see you!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned around, surprised to see Carol here during the day. She was smiling in Pancho&rsquo;s direction.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, Pancho,&ldquo; she said, &quot;you, too.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She met my eyes and smiled wider, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&ldquo; she greeted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey&hellip;,&rdquo; I replied, still a little confused. I smiled with amusement, asking, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Well, you said you had breaks at lunch, and I was off from work today, so I was wondering if you wanted to grab a bite to eat,&ldquo; she explained. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a playful smile. &quot;Now how can I say no to that when you&rsquo;ve made the trip here?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes, but a smile ghosted her lips, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Give me a few minutes and I&rsquo;ll be out,&ldquo; I told her, to which she nodded. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I finished up the last table and went into the back to return the cleaning supplies, before grabbing my jacket, feeling a little excited to spend some more time with Carol one on one. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour, Pancho,&rdquo; I called out to the owner as I joined Carol by the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll see you then, Y/N,&ldquo; he said with a smile.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Carol. &quot;Ready?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. &ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us left the bar and I saw a few cars parked up, probably belonging to the few customers inside currently. Carol led us to a dusty old pickup truck and I nodded my head with admiration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Nice truck.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shrugged. &quot;It&rsquo;s not really mine. I borrowed it from Maria.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled, suppressing the urge to laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first date and you&rsquo;re not even gonna <i>try </i>to lie? Props to you, Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She widened her eyes nervously. &ldquo;I- er- f-first date?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My smile faded as I realised I&rsquo;d interpreted this all wrong. &ldquo;Oh, er, I thought that- I mean, it just seemed like you were asking me out. I can go back inside and pretend this didn&rsquo;t happen if you want.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was already backing up awkwardly when she rested a hand on my arm, stopping me from going further. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No, no, I mean, stay,&ldquo; she got out, meeting my eyes. &quot;A date. Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She mirrored my smile, relaxing a little. &ldquo;Yeah. But I was only planning on taking you to Burger King or something, so that&rsquo;s a pretty shit first date.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. &ldquo;Burger King sounds perfect, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out with relief before motioning for me to go to the truck. &ldquo;After you then.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol drove us to the nearest Burger King, the two of singing along to whatever was on the radio. It was nice and I was glad I&rsquo;d misinterpreted the whole thing because it seemed like she wanted to ask me out, but didn&rsquo;t know how. She was so confident with everything she did, so it was refreshing to see her grow nervous over the little things. Adorable, actually. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After getting our food and taking a seat in one of the booth&rsquo;s, I dug into my fries hungrily.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;So, I figured out what I&rsquo;m saving up for finally,&ldquo; I spoke first, glancing at Carol. &quot;If you&rsquo;re interested.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m interested, Y/N. So, what is it?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I slurped my drink before saying, &ldquo;College.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned opposite me. &ldquo;Y/N, that&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled to myself. &ldquo;Yeah, it is&hellip; I never really got to go because, well, my dad was a drunken mess. But now my savings are building up and I realised I want to learn. To do something I&rsquo;m passionate about.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol watched me with a heartwarming smile. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. &ldquo;Okay, so I haven&rsquo;t exactly figured that out yet&hellip;&rdquo; Carol laughed and I slapped her hand gently, before continuing, &ldquo;&hellip;but I&rsquo;ve got time. I&rsquo;m still saving up, and I&rsquo;ve got a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m gonna figure out. Figure out what I enjoy. Kinda like you with flying.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol&rsquo;s eyes glistened as she stared at me, making my heart beat a little faster. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s seriously amazing, Y/N. You should be so proud of yourself.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m getting there,&ldquo; I joked, making her shake her head with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I continued eating, a comfortable silence settling between us, before I decided to speak again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Out of curiosity, if you didn&rsquo;t think this was a date, what did you think it was? You just wanted to get lunch with me?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her cheeks flushed a little as she nodded. &ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I bit my lip to contain my amusement. &ldquo;You made the trip to see me and caught me on my break. You also remembered specifically when that was, when I&rsquo;ve only mentioned it once. Also, we&rsquo;ve never really hung out outside of Pancho&rsquo;s before. Did you think that&rsquo;s what friends did?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol&rsquo;s cheeks were pink now and she smiled with embarrassment, looking down to her food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Because that&rsquo;s a little gay, Carol,&ldquo; I whispered playfully, aware that there were others around us who might hear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shook her head, avoiding my eyes as I laughed at how cute she looked. Finally, she met my eyes with a knowing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;For a person who isn&rsquo;t sure what what she wants in life, you&rsquo;re very confident when it comes to all of <i>this </i>stuff.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cocked my head to the side, grinning at her. &ldquo;Gee, thanks, Danvers.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol and I went on a few more dates after that, all of them going just as well as the last. I was seriously starting to develop feelings for this woman, but none of us had made <i>the </i>move yet. I wanted her to kiss me, but she hadn&rsquo;t yet and I was wondering when the time would come. If it would ever come. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One evening, I was in the midst of closing up Pancho&rsquo;s for the night, having cleared out the last few customers not long ago. I&rsquo;d just finished washing all the glasses and was stacking them on the shelves and under the counter when I heard a knocking on the doors.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;We&rsquo;re closed!&ldquo; I called out, putting a glass down under the counter before standing up to see who it was. Carol stood there, smiling and waving at me adorably from the other side of the doors. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled and headed to the door to unlock it. I noticed she was wearing her pilot uniform when she walked in, her dog tag around her neck like it was the first time we met. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey,&rdquo; she greeted with a smile, before looking around with surprise. &ldquo;Wow, it looks creepy in here when it&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, smiling at the blonde. &ldquo;What are you doing here, Carol? It&rsquo;s almost midnight.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol looked to me again, tearing her attention from the empty bar. &ldquo;Yeah, well I finished work later than I wanted to. I was going to come earlier, but Dr. Lawson had other plans&hellip; anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d drop by and see if you were still open.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;We&rsquo;re not,&ldquo; I teased. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. &quot;You&rsquo;re not gonna kick me out&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed, heading to the bar. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to kick you out. It&rsquo;s sweet you stopped by. But I can&rsquo;t really chat because I have to finish cleaning up before I leave.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I can help with that,&ldquo; she offered, taking a seat on the stool at the bar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You don&rsquo;t need to do that,&rdquo; I assured her, finishing stacking the remaining glasses. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working all day. You should go home and get some sleep. Don&rsquo;t you have early starts?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I haven&rsquo;t seen you all day though,&ldquo; she reasoned, standing up, &quot;so if I have to help you clean up to have a conversation with you, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I quirked an eyebrow at her and she merely smiled cheekily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What&rsquo;s first, boss?&ldquo; she asked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully before nodding to the disinfectant and cloth sitting on one of the tables. &quot;You wanna start wiping down surfaces?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She saluted me. &ldquo;Aye, aye, Capt-&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Don&rsquo;t finish that sentence, you nerd,&ldquo; I said, laughing now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She flashed me a beautiful smile before getting to work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us spent the next hour cleaning up the place and it was anything but boring. We put some music on from the jukebox and sang along to help make things more fun. I was glad to have Carol there, even if she <i>was</i> pretending that she wasn&rsquo;t tired from work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up driving me home afterwards, in her newly bought pickup truck, and walked me to my front door like a gentlewoman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Thanks again for helping me out tonight,&rdquo; I said, a small smile playing on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;My pleasure,&ldquo; she said. &quot;You working tomorrow evening?&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Yeah.&ldquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll see you after work then,&rdquo; she promised, smiling down at me before stepping forward and hugging me. &ldquo;Goodnight, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I returned the hug, revelling in her warmth and the sweet smell of her perfume. &ldquo;Goodnight, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, smiling at me, and I froze when her eyes met mine. She hesitated, still holding me, as her eyes flickered down to my lips and my heart started to beat faster. Was she finally going to do it?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Except she didn&rsquo;t. She cleared her throat and pulled away, smiling awkwardly. She nodded my way before turning to leave, except I wasn&rsquo;t having it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, calling, &ldquo;Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turned around and I wasted no time in grabbing her dog tag and using it to drag her towards me, before kissing her. I kept ahold of her and closed my eyes, growing warm when she began to kiss me back, resting her hand on my face. She was gentle and careful and I found myself smiling when we pulled apart, breathlessly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Goodnight, Carol,&ldquo; I said, my lips tingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out, biting her lower lip to contain her smile. &quot;Goodnight, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From that night onwards, Carol and I officially became girlfriends. Maria knew and that was about it because of the world we lived in, but I didn&rsquo;t care because I had Carol and that was enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;So, this is where you work,&ldquo; I said, my voice echoing in the hangar where the planes were stored. &quot;This is awesome.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Carol jumped out from one of the plane&rsquo;s cockpits at the sound of my voice. She seemed confused at first, until she realised it was me and a smile formed on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;How did you get in here?&ldquo; she asked, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Maria let me in,&rdquo; I explained, wrapping my arms around her waist, knowing we were alone so we could act normally. &ldquo;I wanted to see you at work and she said it was okay.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Well, this is the best surprise I&rsquo;ve had all day,&ldquo; she admitted, eyes meeting mine and glistening with happiness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What, no kiss?&rdquo; I teased, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;Or do I have to make the first move?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, a smile playing on her lips. &ldquo;You ever gonna let me live that one down?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ever since our first kiss, I would use any chance I could to embarrass Carol about the fact that she wimped out last second. It always made her embarrassed, but I loved it because she was too cute about the whole thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled, shaking my head. &ldquo;Never. And I believe it went something like this&hellip;&rdquo; I grabbed her dog tag and pulled her closer before pressing my lips to hers, feeling a surge of butterflies in my stomach at the taste of her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Ah, never gets old,&ldquo; I joked when we pulled apart, making her smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We grew closer from there on out and I fell in love with the pilot, admitting it after a few months had passed. We stayed in a relationship for a year, until something happened. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew about her job and I always tried to understand when she rambled excitedly about new projects she was working on with Dr. Lawson, but she either spoke too fast or went on about things I didn&rsquo;t get, so I never questioned her. She was happy, so I was happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And I guess I blamed myself because maybe if I listened to her, I could&rsquo;ve understood how dangerous her mission was and stopped her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But I didn&rsquo;t listen, and one day, after leaving for a special mission, she kissed me goodbye and never came back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I found out from Maria, who was as heartbroken as I was. Except I wasn&rsquo;t just heartbroken, I was fuming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I told her to come back safely,&rdquo; I got out through salty tears. I was holding Carol&rsquo;s dog tag, the metal half-melted from the crash. It was the only thing they recovered of Carol, and Maria wanted me to have it. &ldquo;She was supposed to come back.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It wasn&rsquo;t a safe flight,&ldquo; Maria said, her energy drained. &quot;I should&rsquo;ve stopped her.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;What?&ldquo; I asked, snapping my head to Maria. &quot;It wasn&rsquo;t safe?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria shook her head, her own tears falling. &ldquo;It was a test flight. It was just supposed to be Lawson doing it, but Carol just had to help her.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my jaw, growing angry at everything. The world, God, Carol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;She lied to me,&ldquo; I growled, clutching the dog tag. &quot;She told me it was a simple flight. She&hellip; she lied&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;She probably didn&rsquo;t want to worry you, Y/N,&ldquo; Maria tried to reassure me, but I was too pissed to care for her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;No! That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; I yelled, before throwing the dog tag across the room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that. I hate Carol for lying to me. She left! She should be here! She said she would be back and she fucking lied! She fucking lied&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was crying now, sobbing into my hands. I felt Maria wrap her arms around me, pulling me in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;She said she&rsquo;d be back,&ldquo; I muttered between sobs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I know, sweetie, I know,&rdquo; Maria cooed, rubbing soothing circles on my back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I hate her&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p>*** </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Six years had passed since that moment, that moment when I lost one of the few people in my life whom I loved dearly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up going to university, studying business management and getting my degree. I was now partners with Pancho and had helped him franchise his business, opening two bars across North America. It all worked out. <i>Almost</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It hurt at first, losing Carol, because I was constantly trying to fight the anger I held for her for leaving and lying to me. I avoided talking about her, even with Maria and Monica. It hurt too much. But when I went to university, all I could think about was Carol. She was the reason I&rsquo;d gone in the first place and I wished she was there to see me. But she wasn&rsquo;t. So, when I graduated, I tried my hardest to forget about her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was going well, until Maria explained to me that she was back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was back and in fact had never died. She&rsquo;d been here for a few days now, but Maria hadn&rsquo;t told me because she needed to make sure, for my sake. But it was real and Carol was alive. Part alien with superpowers, but alive. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;She&rsquo;s beginning to remember things,&rdquo; Maria explained from across me at her kitchen table. &ldquo;She remembers you. Well, who you are to her. She&rsquo;s waiting outside right now, but you don&rsquo;t have to see her if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ran my hand through my hair, still trying to grasp the concept that Carol was here. Maria had explained everything she&rsquo;d been through and I was adjusting, but I was so confused to how I felt. I was, of course, over the moon that she was alive this whole time. I was still hurting though, frustrated and pissed at her for leaving. Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t her fault, but she&rsquo;d lied to me. I don&rsquo;t know, I needed to blame someone. It was the only logical thing I could do all these years without going insane with grief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;ll see her,&ldquo; I said to Maria. &quot;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria nodded, giving me an encouraging smile, before leading me outside. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was sat at Maria&rsquo;s workbench in the back garden, messing around with the tools. When she heard us approaching though, she stood up and stepped forward. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gasped a little, shocked that she was really there. All these years and she was back. She looked the same, save for her longer hair. Still as beautiful as ever. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Hey, Y/N,&ldquo; she spoke first, her voice penetrating through me like a shard of broken glass. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotions. I thought I was okay with this, with her being back. But seeing her stood before me with a small smile on her annoyingly stunning face, alive and very much not dead, pissed me off. All the anger from the past six years built up and bubbled to the surface as she awaited my response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn&rsquo;t even realise I&rsquo;d punched her square in the face until she was clutching her cheek with her hand and Maria had stepped between us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N!&rdquo; Maria shouted, glaring at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I widened my eyes, realising what I&rsquo;d done. &ldquo;Shit, sorry!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I probably deserved that,&ldquo; she said, breathing out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You definitely deserved that, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; I admitted, staring at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Y/N!&ldquo; Maria chastised. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol raised a thumb up, still holding her cheek and flinching. &quot;I&rsquo;m fine, I just need some ice\u2013 <i>ah</i>!&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria took us both inside into the kitchen and gave Carol some frozen peas to place on her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Right, I&rsquo;ll leave you both to talk <i>if </i>you promise not to hit her again,&ldquo; Maria said, giving me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded from my seat beside Carol. &quot;It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Good,&ldquo; she said, before softening her expression. &quot;You got this.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria left and Carol and I were left alone in the kitchen, awkwardly sat by one another as she held a pack of frozen peas to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;To be fair, every superhero I&rsquo;ve ever heard of doesn&rsquo;t feel pain,&ldquo; I spoke first, shrugging my shoulders. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m not a superhero,&rdquo; Carol replied, meeting my eyes with her hazel ones. I thought I&rsquo;d never look into them again, but here I was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s not what Monica&rsquo;s been saying.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My tense expression softened. &quot;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re actually here&hellip; I was so angry at you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That much is obvious,&ldquo; she mumbled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You left, Carol,&rdquo; I told her, shaking my head. &ldquo;You lied to me saying it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous and you left. All that they recovered from the stupid crash was your stupid dog tag.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry,&ldquo; she spoke softly, eyes never leaving mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat. &quot;I loved you.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I know. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You left.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I know.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I <i>hated </i>you.&ldquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn&rsquo;t reply, instead she looked down at her hands with sad eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, managing to push back any tears I thought would come. &quot;What happens now? You back for good?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;That&rsquo;s the plan,&ldquo; she said, her shoulders sagging. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re just gonna go back into the Air Force? They think you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head, looking up again and dropping her hand to her lap, with the frozen peas in, revealing her purple-red cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I have other priorities now,&ldquo; she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet, myself not knowing what to say. Instead, I frowned at her cheek, courtesy of me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I apologised, grabbing the frozen peas from her hand and dragging my chair closer to hers so I could hold the frozen bag to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;It&rsquo;s okay,&ldquo; she said, eyes flickering to mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet again, and I realised how close we were when I felt her warm breath tickling my skin. I held her gaze, noting the beautiful golden flecks shining back at me. I felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she hesitated, her eyes moving to my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You&rsquo;re not going to do it,&rdquo; I said, moving the frozen peas from her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes met mine again. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Kiss me,&ldquo; I deadpanned. &quot;You&rsquo;re going to stare at me. You&rsquo;ll want to do it. Then you&rsquo;ll decide not to for whatever reason.&rdquo; She seemed confused as she listened, so I continued. &ldquo;You did the same thing when we first kissed. Or should I say, when <i>I</i> first kissed <i>you</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;I remember,&ldquo; she spoke gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised to hear that, but I kept my cool as I gave her a knowing look. &quot;Yeah, well, you&rsquo;re not going to do it.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;Why?&ldquo; she asked, not daring to move away. &quot;Because you say so?&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. &ldquo;No, because even though you&rsquo;ve been in space for six years, I still know you, Carol, and I know you won&rsquo;t d\u2013&rdquo;</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol moved forward to silence me, pressing her lips to mine in a hasty kiss. I was surprised at her abruptness and newfound confidence, but closed my eyes when I realised how long it had been since I&rsquo;d felt her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She held the nape of my neck, pulling me closer to her as she deepened the kiss, slipping her tongue between my lips and making me gasp quietly. My heart was pounding in my chest, unable to catch up with the fact that the woman I hadn&rsquo;t stopped loving these past six years was kissing me like she had never stopped loving me, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, we pulled away from each other, breathlessly, with our foreheads resting against one another. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;You were saying?&ldquo; she muttered, and a small smile was forming on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I almost cried as I smiled at her. &quot;I guess I have a lot more to learn about you, Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&quot;And I can&rsquo;t wait to know you all over again, Y/L/N,&ldquo; she admitted, eyes peering through mine, making me believe that maybe, things were going to be okay. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn&rsquo;t so angry anymore.</p>",

My eyes flickered down to her dog tag, which I found intriguing, and I stood up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can I see it?\u201c I asked curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She realised I was looking at her dog tag and nodded, saying, \"Sure,\u201d before pulling it from around her neck and holding it out for me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled excitedly and took it from her, leaning on the bar in front of her and studying it closely. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Carol Danvers,\u201c I read aloud, before looking up, a little surprised to see her hazel eyes studying me closely. \"Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I handed it back to her, watching as she pulled it around her neck and lifted her hair that was caught. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You, too\u2026,\u201c she said, before raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N Y/L/N,\u201d I filled in, standing up with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N Y/L/N,\u201c she repeated, and I wouldn\u2019t admit it then, but my name sounded good coming from her lips. \"You\u2019re new here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As of a few days ago,\u201c I said, before jokingly adding, \"They just couldn\u2019t resist my amazing drink-making skills.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, can I get a drink over here?!\u201c someone called from the other end of the bar, ruining the moment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Duty calls,\u201d I mumbled, giving Carol one last smile before leaving to serve another customer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of my shift that evening wasn\u2019t as bad compared to the past few days, since Carol and her friend, Maria, were there to keep me company. It was nice to be able to talk to customers who weren\u2019t checking me out or flirting with me whilst half-drunk. Plus, they were lovely ladies who were <i>amazingly </i>cool pilots. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two women stopped by quite frequently and I learnt they were regulars, as were most of their team on the Air Force. It was fun talking to them when they came every few evenings, and I was beginning to look forward to their arrival when they came since they made my shift a whole lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Carol, who I was growing fond of. She was funny and confident and I was trying ever so hard to figure out if she was into girls or not, because there were moments - glances or little touches - between us that felt more than \u2018friendly\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to assume though, so I never really pursued it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was one evening when it wasn\u2019t that busy and Carol and Maria were there, keeping me company. We were talking about whether it was better going out to watch a film or to rent one and stay in - silly, but that\u2019s what we happened to be talking about. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We should get going,\u201c Maria said, checking the time on her watch. \"Monica\u2019s babysitter leaves at eight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monica was Maria\u2019s kid, whom she\u2019d mentioned countless times. I\u2019d never met her, but she sounded adorable by the way her and Carol described her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys again!\u201c I said with a smile, watching as Maria got up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er, is it cool if I stay for a little longer? I\u2019ll catch the bus home,\u201d Carol said, looking up at Maria. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening, but after a few exchanged glances between them both, Maria nodded, smiling at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I\u2019ll see you later, Carol. See ya, Y/N!\u201c she said, waving at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye and watched her leave before looking to Carol with a teasing smile. \"Are my ever-so-interesting topics of conversation too much for you to resist that you chose to stay, Danvers?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol bit her lip to contain her laugh. \u201cYeah. You nailed it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her choosing to stay that evening told me all I needed to know - she was interested. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was wiping the empty tables down with a cloth when I heard the front door open. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Carol,\u201c Pancho, the owner, called from the bar, \"good to see you!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned around, surprised to see Carol here during the day. She was smiling in Pancho\u2019s direction.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Pancho,\u201c she said, \"you, too.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She met my eyes and smiled wider, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201c she greeted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey\u2026,\u201d I replied, still a little confused. I smiled with amusement, asking, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you said you had breaks at lunch, and I was off from work today, so I was wondering if you wanted to grab a bite to eat,\u201c she explained. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a playful smile. \"Now how can I say no to that when you\u2019ve made the trip here?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes, but a smile ghosted her lips, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll be out,\u201c I told her, to which she nodded. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I finished up the last table and went into the back to return the cleaning supplies, before grabbing my jacket, feeling a little excited to spend some more time with Carol one on one. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll be back in an hour, Pancho,\u201d I called out to the owner as I joined Carol by the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see you then, Y/N,\u201c he said with a smile.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Carol. \"Ready?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us left the bar and I saw a few cars parked up, probably belonging to the few customers inside currently. Carol led us to a dusty old pickup truck and I nodded my head with admiration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice truck.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shrugged. \"It\u2019s not really mine. I borrowed it from Maria.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled, suppressing the urge to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s the first date and you\u2019re not even gonna <i>try </i>to lie? Props to you, Danvers.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She widened her eyes nervously. \u201cI- er- f-first date?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My smile faded as I realised I\u2019d interpreted this all wrong. \u201cOh, er, I thought that- I mean, it just seemed like you were asking me out. I can go back inside and pretend this didn\u2019t happen if you want.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was already backing up awkwardly when she rested a hand on my arm, stopping me from going further. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, I mean, stay,\u201c she got out, meeting my eyes. \"A date. Yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She mirrored my smile, relaxing a little. \u201cYeah. But I was only planning on taking you to Burger King or something, so that\u2019s a pretty shit first date.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cBurger King sounds perfect, Carol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out with relief before motioning for me to go to the truck. \u201cAfter you then.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol drove us to the nearest Burger King, the two of singing along to whatever was on the radio. It was nice and I was glad I\u2019d misinterpreted the whole thing because it seemed like she wanted to ask me out, but didn\u2019t know how. She was so confident with everything she did, so it was refreshing to see her grow nervous over the little things. Adorable, actually. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After getting our food and taking a seat in one of the booth\u2019s, I dug into my fries hungrily.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, I figured out what I\u2019m saving up for finally,\u201c I spoke first, glancing at Carol. \"If you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. \u201cOf course I\u2019m interested, Y/N. So, what is it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I slurped my drink before saying, \u201cCollege.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned opposite me. \u201cY/N, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled to myself. \u201cYeah, it is\u2026 I never really got to go because, well, my dad was a drunken mess. But now my savings are building up and I realised I want to learn. To do something I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol watched me with a heartwarming smile. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \u201cOkay, so I haven\u2019t exactly figured that out yet\u2026\u201d Carol laughed and I slapped her hand gently, before continuing, \u201c\u2026but I\u2019ve got time. I\u2019m still saving up, and I\u2019ve got a long way to go, but I\u2019m gonna figure out. Figure out what I enjoy. Kinda like you with flying.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol\u2019s eyes glistened as she stared at me, making my heart beat a little faster. \u201cThat\u2019s seriously amazing, Y/N. You should be so proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m getting there,\u201c I joked, making her shake her head with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I continued eating, a comfortable silence settling between us, before I decided to speak again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Out of curiosity, if you didn\u2019t think this was a date, what did you think it was? You just wanted to get lunch with me?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her cheeks flushed a little as she nodded. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I bit my lip to contain my amusement. \u201cYou made the trip to see me and caught me on my break. You also remembered specifically when that was, when I\u2019ve only mentioned it once. Also, we\u2019ve never really hung out outside of Pancho\u2019s before. Did you think that\u2019s what friends did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol\u2019s cheeks were pink now and she smiled with embarrassment, looking down to her food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because that\u2019s a little gay, Carol,\u201c I whispered playfully, aware that there were others around us who might hear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shook her head, avoiding my eyes as I laughed at how cute she looked. Finally, she met my eyes with a knowing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For a person who isn\u2019t sure what what she wants in life, you\u2019re very confident when it comes to all of <i>this </i>stuff.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cocked my head to the side, grinning at her. \u201cGee, thanks, Danvers.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol and I went on a few more dates after that, all of them going just as well as the last. I was seriously starting to develop feelings for this woman, but none of us had made <i>the </i>move yet. I wanted her to kiss me, but she hadn\u2019t yet and I was wondering when the time would come. If it would ever come. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One evening, I was in the midst of closing up Pancho\u2019s for the night, having cleared out the last few customers not long ago. I\u2019d just finished washing all the glasses and was stacking them on the shelves and under the counter when I heard a knocking on the doors.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We\u2019re closed!\u201c I called out, putting a glass down under the counter before standing up to see who it was. Carol stood there, smiling and waving at me adorably from the other side of the doors. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled and headed to the door to unlock it. I noticed she was wearing her pilot uniform when she walked in, her dog tag around her neck like it was the first time we met. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she greeted with a smile, before looking around with surprise. \u201cWow, it looks creepy in here when it\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, smiling at the blonde. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Carol? It\u2019s almost midnight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol looked to me again, tearing her attention from the empty bar. \u201cYeah, well I finished work later than I wanted to. I was going to come earlier, but Dr. Lawson had other plans\u2026 anyway, I thought I\u2019d drop by and see if you were still open.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We\u2019re not,\u201c I teased. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. \"You\u2019re not gonna kick me out\u2026 right?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed, heading to the bar. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to kick you out. It\u2019s sweet you stopped by. But I can\u2019t really chat because I have to finish cleaning up before I leave.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can help with that,\u201c she offered, taking a seat on the stool at the bar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d I assured her, finishing stacking the remaining glasses. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working all day. You should go home and get some sleep. Don\u2019t you have early starts?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I haven\u2019t seen you all day though,\u201c she reasoned, standing up, \"so if I have to help you clean up to have a conversation with you, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I quirked an eyebrow at her and she merely smiled cheekily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What\u2019s first, boss?\u201c she asked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully before nodding to the disinfectant and cloth sitting on one of the tables. \"You wanna start wiping down surfaces?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She saluted me. \u201cAye, aye, Capt-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t finish that sentence, you nerd,\u201c I said, laughing now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She flashed me a beautiful smile before getting to work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us spent the next hour cleaning up the place and it was anything but boring. We put some music on from the jukebox and sang along to help make things more fun. I was glad to have Carol there, even if she <i>was</i> pretending that she wasn\u2019t tired from work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up driving me home afterwards, in her newly bought pickup truck, and walked me to my front door like a gentlewoman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks again for helping me out tonight,\u201d I said, a small smile playing on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My pleasure,\u201c she said. \"You working tomorrow evening?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see you after work then,\u201d she promised, smiling down at me before stepping forward and hugging me. \u201cGoodnight, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I returned the hug, revelling in her warmth and the sweet smell of her perfume. \u201cGoodnight, Carol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, smiling at me, and I froze when her eyes met mine. She hesitated, still holding me, as her eyes flickered down to my lips and my heart started to beat faster. Was she finally going to do it?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Except she didn\u2019t. She cleared her throat and pulled away, smiling awkwardly. She nodded my way before turning to leave, except I wasn\u2019t having it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, calling, \u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turned around and I wasted no time in grabbing her dog tag and using it to drag her towards me, before kissing her. I kept ahold of her and closed my eyes, growing warm when she began to kiss me back, resting her hand on my face. She was gentle and careful and I found myself smiling when we pulled apart, breathlessly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Goodnight, Carol,\u201c I said, my lips tingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out, biting her lower lip to contain her smile. \"Goodnight, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From that night onwards, Carol and I officially became girlfriends. Maria knew and that was about it because of the world we lived in, but I didn\u2019t care because I had Carol and that was enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, this is where you work,\u201c I said, my voice echoing in the hangar where the planes were stored. \"This is awesome.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Carol jumped out from one of the plane\u2019s cockpits at the sound of my voice. She seemed confused at first, until she realised it was me and a smile formed on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did you get in here?\u201c she asked, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maria let me in,\u201d I explained, wrapping my arms around her waist, knowing we were alone so we could act normally. \u201cI wanted to see you at work and she said it was okay.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, this is the best surprise I\u2019ve had all day,\u201c she admitted, eyes meeting mine and glistening with happiness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, no kiss?\u201d I teased, raising an eyebrow. \u201cOr do I have to make the first move?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, a smile playing on her lips. \u201cYou ever gonna let me live that one down?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ever since our first kiss, I would use any chance I could to embarrass Carol about the fact that she wimped out last second. It always made her embarrassed, but I loved it because she was too cute about the whole thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled, shaking my head. \u201cNever. And I believe it went something like this\u2026\u201d I grabbed her dog tag and pulled her closer before pressing my lips to hers, feeling a surge of butterflies in my stomach at the taste of her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, never gets old,\u201c I joked when we pulled apart, making her smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We grew closer from there on out and I fell in love with the pilot, admitting it after a few months had passed. We stayed in a relationship for a year, until something happened. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew about her job and I always tried to understand when she rambled excitedly about new projects she was working on with Dr. Lawson, but she either spoke too fast or went on about things I didn\u2019t get, so I never questioned her. She was happy, so I was happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And I guess I blamed myself because maybe if I listened to her, I could\u2019ve understood how dangerous her mission was and stopped her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But I didn\u2019t listen, and one day, after leaving for a special mission, she kissed me goodbye and never came back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I found out from Maria, who was as heartbroken as I was. Except I wasn\u2019t just heartbroken, I was fuming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told her to come back safely,\u201d I got out through salty tears. I was holding Carol\u2019s dog tag, the metal half-melted from the crash. It was the only thing they recovered of Carol, and Maria wanted me to have it. \u201cShe was supposed to come back.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It wasn\u2019t a safe flight,\u201c Maria said, her energy drained. \"I should\u2019ve stopped her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201c I asked, snapping my head to Maria. \"It wasn\u2019t safe?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria shook her head, her own tears falling. \u201cIt was a test flight. It was just supposed to be Lawson doing it, but Carol just had to help her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my jaw, growing angry at everything. The world, God, Carol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She lied to me,\u201c I growled, clutching the dog tag. \"She told me it was a simple flight. She\u2026 she lied\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She probably didn\u2019t want to worry you, Y/N,\u201c Maria tried to reassure me, but I was too pissed to care for her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d I yelled, before throwing the dog tag across the room. \u201cI don\u2019t want that. I hate Carol for lying to me. She left! She should be here! She said she would be back and she fucking lied! She fucking lied\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was crying now, sobbing into my hands. I felt Maria wrap her arms around me, pulling me in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She said she\u2019d be back,\u201c I muttered between sobs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, sweetie, I know,\u201d Maria cooed, rubbing soothing circles on my back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate her\u2026\u201c </p><p>*** </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Six years had passed since that moment, that moment when I lost one of the few people in my life whom I loved dearly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up going to university, studying business management and getting my degree. I was now partners with Pancho and had helped him franchise his business, opening two bars across North America. It all worked out. <i>Almost</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It hurt at first, losing Carol, because I was constantly trying to fight the anger I held for her for leaving and lying to me. I avoided talking about her, even with Maria and Monica. It hurt too much. But when I went to university, all I could think about was Carol. She was the reason I\u2019d gone in the first place and I wished she was there to see me. But she wasn\u2019t. So, when I graduated, I tried my hardest to forget about her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was going well, until Maria explained to me that she was back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was back and in fact had never died. She\u2019d been here for a few days now, but Maria hadn\u2019t told me because she needed to make sure, for my sake. But it was real and Carol was alive. Part alien with superpowers, but alive. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She\u2019s beginning to remember things,\u201d Maria explained from across me at her kitchen table. \u201cShe remembers you. Well, who you are to her. She\u2019s waiting outside right now, but you don\u2019t have to see her if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ran my hand through my hair, still trying to grasp the concept that Carol was here. Maria had explained everything she\u2019d been through and I was adjusting, but I was so confused to how I felt. I was, of course, over the moon that she was alive this whole time. I was still hurting though, frustrated and pissed at her for leaving. Yeah, it wasn\u2019t her fault, but she\u2019d lied to me. I don\u2019t know, I needed to blame someone. It was the only logical thing I could do all these years without going insane with grief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see her,\u201c I said to Maria. \"Let\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria nodded, giving me an encouraging smile, before leading me outside. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was sat at Maria\u2019s workbench in the back garden, messing around with the tools. When she heard us approaching though, she stood up and stepped forward. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gasped a little, shocked that she was really there. All these years and she was back. She looked the same, save for her longer hair. Still as beautiful as ever. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Y/N,\u201c she spoke first, her voice penetrating through me like a shard of broken glass. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotions. I thought I was okay with this, with her being back. But seeing her stood before me with a small smile on her annoyingly stunning face, alive and very much not dead, pissed me off. All the anger from the past six years built up and bubbled to the surface as she awaited my response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn\u2019t even realise I\u2019d punched her square in the face until she was clutching her cheek with her hand and Maria had stepped between us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N!\u201d Maria shouted, glaring at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I widened my eyes, realising what I\u2019d done. \u201cShit, sorry!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I probably deserved that,\u201c she said, breathing out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You definitely deserved that, but I shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d I admitted, staring at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N!\u201c Maria chastised. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol raised a thumb up, still holding her cheek and flinching. \"I\u2019m fine, I just need some ice\u2013 <i>ah</i>!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria took us both inside into the kitchen and gave Carol some frozen peas to place on her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, I\u2019ll leave you both to talk <i>if </i>you promise not to hit her again,\u201c Maria said, giving me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded from my seat beside Carol. \"It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good,\u201c she said, before softening her expression. \"You got this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria left and Carol and I were left alone in the kitchen, awkwardly sat by one another as she held a pack of frozen peas to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To be fair, every superhero I\u2019ve ever heard of doesn\u2019t feel pain,\u201c I spoke first, shrugging my shoulders. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m not a superhero,\u201d Carol replied, meeting my eyes with her hazel ones. I thought I\u2019d never look into them again, but here I was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s not what Monica\u2019s been saying.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My tense expression softened. \"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually here\u2026 I was so angry at you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That much is obvious,\u201c she mumbled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You left, Carol,\u201d I told her, shaking my head. \u201cYou lied to me saying it wasn\u2019t dangerous and you left. All that they recovered from the stupid crash was your stupid dog tag.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201c she spoke softly, eyes never leaving mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat. \"I loved you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You left.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I <i>hated </i>you.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u2019t reply, instead she looked down at her hands with sad eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, managing to push back any tears I thought would come. \"What happens now? You back for good?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s the plan,\u201c she said, her shoulders sagging. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re just gonna go back into the Air Force? They think you\u2019re dead.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head, looking up again and dropping her hand to her lap, with the frozen peas in, revealing her purple-red cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have other priorities now,\u201c she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet, myself not knowing what to say. Instead, I frowned at her cheek, courtesy of me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologised, grabbing the frozen peas from her hand and dragging my chair closer to hers so I could hold the frozen bag to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s okay,\u201c she said, eyes flickering to mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet again, and I realised how close we were when I felt her warm breath tickling my skin. I held her gaze, noting the beautiful golden flecks shining back at me. I felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she hesitated, her eyes moving to my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d I said, moving the frozen peas from her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes met mine again. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kiss me,\u201c I deadpanned. \"You\u2019re going to stare at me. You\u2019ll want to do it. Then you\u2019ll decide not to for whatever reason.\u201d She seemed confused as she listened, so I continued. \u201cYou did the same thing when we first kissed. Or should I say, when <i>I</i> first kissed <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I remember,\u201c she spoke gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised to hear that, but I kept my cool as I gave her a knowing look. \"Yeah, well, you\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why?\u201c she asked, not daring to move away. \"Because you say so?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. \u201cNo, because even though you\u2019ve been in space for six years, I still know you, Carol, and I know you won\u2019t d\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol moved forward to silence me, pressing her lips to mine in a hasty kiss. I was surprised at her abruptness and newfound confidence, but closed my eyes when I realised how long it had been since I\u2019d felt her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She held the nape of my neck, pulling me closer to her as she deepened the kiss, slipping her tongue between my lips and making me gasp quietly. My heart was pounding in my chest, unable to catch up with the fact that the woman I hadn\u2019t stopped loving these past six years was kissing me like she had never stopped loving me, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, we pulled away from each other, breathlessly, with our foreheads resting against one another. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You were saying?\u201c she muttered, and a small smile was forming on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I almost cried as I smiled at her. \"I guess I have a lot more to learn about you, Danvers.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I can\u2019t wait to know you all over again, Y/L/N,\u201c she admitted, eyes peering through mine, making me believe that maybe, things were going to be okay. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn\u2019t so angry anymore.</p>",

When I placed them back, my eyes drifted to the dog tag hung around the blonde\u2019s neck, similar to the ones I\u2019d seen some of the Air Force guys wearing around Pancho\u2019s the past few days. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re in the Air Force,\u201d I blurted out accidentally. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blonde met my eyes and gave me a confused smile. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kind of having to follow through with what I was saying, I nodded to her dog tag. \u201cThe dog tag. Air Force, right? From the base near here?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled and nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s really cool,\u201c I said, smiling impressively. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You think?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, yeah,\u201c I said, sure of myself. \"I mean, you must be doing something you love, even with all of these\u2026\u201d I looked around the bar, at all the obnoxious, self-righteous men who were also part of the Air Force, \u201c\u2026<i>obstacles</i> in the way.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blonde laughed and I smiled at the sound. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I guess,\u201c she said with a shrug, taking a sip of her beer before nodding to me. \"What about you, though?

It\u2019s something to joke about.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stranger straightened up, leaning forward as she stared up at me with hopeful eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you could do something more if you put your mind to it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shrugged. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019m saving up for something, but I don\u2019t know what yet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her eyes squinting gorgeously. \u201cThere you go then.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I returned the smile, a newfound interest developing in this complete stranger who I\u2019d somehow just shared parts of my life with that nobody really knew. My eyes flickered down to her dog tag, which I found intriguing, and I stood up straight. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can I see it?\u201c I asked curiously. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She realised I was looking at her dog tag and nodded, saying, \"Sure,\u201d before pulling it from around her neck and holding it out for me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled excitedly and took it from her, leaning on the bar in front of her and studying it closely. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Carol Danvers,\u201c I read aloud, before looking up, a little surprised to see her hazel eyes studying me closely. \"Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I handed it back to her, watching as she pulled it around her neck and lifted her hair that was caught. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You, too\u2026,\u201c she said, before raising an eyebrow. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N Y/L/N,\u201d I filled in, standing up with a smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N Y/L/N,\u201c she repeated, and I wouldn\u2019t admit it then, but my name sounded good coming from her lips. \"You\u2019re new here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As of a few days ago,\u201c I said, before jokingly adding, \"They just couldn\u2019t resist my amazing drink-making skills.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, can I get a drink over here?!\u201c someone called from the other end of the bar, ruining the moment. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Duty calls,\u201d I mumbled, giving Carol one last smile before leaving to serve another customer. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of my shift that evening wasn\u2019t as bad compared to the past few days, since Carol and her friend, Maria, were there to keep me company. It was nice to be able to talk to customers who weren\u2019t checking me out or flirting with me whilst half-drunk. Plus, they were lovely ladies who were <i>amazingly </i>cool pilots. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two women stopped by quite frequently and I learnt they were regulars, as were most of their team on the Air Force. It was fun talking to them when they came every few evenings, and I was beginning to look forward to their arrival when they came since they made my shift a whole lot better. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Especially Carol, who I was growing fond of. She was funny and confident and I was trying ever so hard to figure out if she was into girls or not, because there were moments - glances or little touches - between us that felt more than \u2018friendly\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to assume though, so I never really pursued it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was one evening when it wasn\u2019t that busy and Carol and Maria were there, keeping me company. We were talking about whether it was better going out to watch a film or to rent one and stay in - silly, but that\u2019s what we happened to be talking about. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We should get going,\u201c Maria said, checking the time on her watch. \"Monica\u2019s babysitter leaves at eight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monica was Maria\u2019s kid, whom she\u2019d mentioned countless times. I\u2019d never met her, but she sounded adorable by the way her and Carol described her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys again!\u201c I said with a smile, watching as Maria got up. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er, is it cool if I stay for a little longer? I\u2019ll catch the bus home,\u201d Carol said, looking up at Maria. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening, but after a few exchanged glances between them both, Maria nodded, smiling at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I\u2019ll see you later, Carol. See ya, Y/N!\u201c she said, waving at us both. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I waved goodbye and watched her leave before looking to Carol with a teasing smile. \"Are my ever-so-interesting topics of conversation too much for you to resist that you chose to stay, Danvers?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol bit her lip to contain her laugh. \u201cYeah. You nailed it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her choosing to stay that evening told me all I needed to know - she was interested. </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was wiping the empty tables down with a cloth when I heard the front door open. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Carol,\u201c Pancho, the owner, called from the bar, \"good to see you!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I turned around, surprised to see Carol here during the day. She was smiling in Pancho\u2019s direction.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Pancho,\u201c she said, \"you, too.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She met my eyes and smiled wider, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201c she greeted. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey\u2026,\u201d I replied, still a little confused. I smiled with amusement, asking, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you said you had breaks at lunch, and I was off from work today, so I was wondering if you wanted to grab a bite to eat,\u201c she explained. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gave her a playful smile. \"Now how can I say no to that when you\u2019ve made the trip here?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She rolled her eyes, but a smile ghosted her lips, making me laugh. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Give me a few minutes and I\u2019ll be out,\u201c I told her, to which she nodded. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I finished up the last table and went into the back to return the cleaning supplies, before grabbing my jacket, feeling a little excited to spend some more time with Carol one on one. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll be back in an hour, Pancho,\u201d I called out to the owner as I joined Carol by the door. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see you then, Y/N,\u201c he said with a smile.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I looked to Carol. \"Ready?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us left the bar and I saw a few cars parked up, probably belonging to the few customers inside currently. Carol led us to a dusty old pickup truck and I nodded my head with admiration. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice truck.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shrugged. \"It\u2019s not really mine. I borrowed it from Maria.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled, suppressing the urge to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s the first date and you\u2019re not even gonna <i>try </i>to lie? Props to you, Danvers.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She widened her eyes nervously. \u201cI- er- f-first date?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My smile faded as I realised I\u2019d interpreted this all wrong. \u201cOh, er, I thought that- I mean, it just seemed like you were asking me out. I can go back inside and pretend this didn\u2019t happen if you want.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was already backing up awkwardly when she rested a hand on my arm, stopping me from going further. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, I mean, stay,\u201c she got out, meeting my eyes. \"A date. Yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She mirrored my smile, relaxing a little. \u201cYeah. But I was only planning on taking you to Burger King or something, so that\u2019s a pretty shit first date.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed. \u201cBurger King sounds perfect, Carol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out with relief before motioning for me to go to the truck. \u201cAfter you then.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol drove us to the nearest Burger King, the two of singing along to whatever was on the radio. It was nice and I was glad I\u2019d misinterpreted the whole thing because it seemed like she wanted to ask me out, but didn\u2019t know how. She was so confident with everything she did, so it was refreshing to see her grow nervous over the little things. Adorable, actually. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After getting our food and taking a seat in one of the booth\u2019s, I dug into my fries hungrily.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, I figured out what I\u2019m saving up for finally,\u201c I spoke first, glancing at Carol. \"If you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. \u201cOf course I\u2019m interested, Y/N. So, what is it?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I slurped my drink before saying, \u201cCollege.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grinned opposite me. \u201cY/N, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I smiled to myself. \u201cYeah, it is\u2026 I never really got to go because, well, my dad was a drunken mess. But now my savings are building up and I realised I want to learn. To do something I\u2019m passionate about.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol watched me with a heartwarming smile. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I pulled a face. \u201cOkay, so I haven\u2019t exactly figured that out yet\u2026\u201d Carol laughed and I slapped her hand gently, before continuing, \u201c\u2026but I\u2019ve got time. I\u2019m still saving up, and I\u2019ve got a long way to go, but I\u2019m gonna figure out. Figure out what I enjoy. Kinda like you with flying.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol\u2019s eyes glistened as she stared at me, making my heart beat a little faster. \u201cThat\u2019s seriously amazing, Y/N. You should be so proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m getting there,\u201c I joked, making her shake her head with amusement. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I continued eating, a comfortable silence settling between us, before I decided to speak again. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Out of curiosity, if you didn\u2019t think this was a date, what did you think it was? You just wanted to get lunch with me?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her cheeks flushed a little as she nodded. \u201cWell, yeah.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I bit my lip to contain my amusement. \u201cYou made the trip to see me and caught me on my break. You also remembered specifically when that was, when I\u2019ve only mentioned it once. Also, we\u2019ve never really hung out outside of Pancho\u2019s before. Did you think that\u2019s what friends did?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol\u2019s cheeks were pink now and she smiled with embarrassment, looking down to her food. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Because that\u2019s a little gay, Carol,\u201c I whispered playfully, aware that there were others around us who might hear. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol shook her head, avoiding my eyes as I laughed at how cute she looked. Finally, she met my eyes with a knowing smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For a person who isn\u2019t sure what what she wants in life, you\u2019re very confident when it comes to all of <i>this </i>stuff.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I cocked my head to the side, grinning at her. \u201cGee, thanks, Danvers.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol and I went on a few more dates after that, all of them going just as well as the last. I was seriously starting to develop feelings for this woman, but none of us had made <i>the </i>move yet. I wanted her to kiss me, but she hadn\u2019t yet and I was wondering when the time would come. If it would ever come. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One evening, I was in the midst of closing up Pancho\u2019s for the night, having cleared out the last few customers not long ago. I\u2019d just finished washing all the glasses and was stacking them on the shelves and under the counter when I heard a knocking on the doors.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We\u2019re closed!\u201c I called out, putting a glass down under the counter before standing up to see who it was. Carol stood there, smiling and waving at me adorably from the other side of the doors. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled and headed to the door to unlock it. I noticed she was wearing her pilot uniform when she walked in, her dog tag around her neck like it was the first time we met. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey,\u201d she greeted with a smile, before looking around with surprise. \u201cWow, it looks creepy in here when it\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, smiling at the blonde. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Carol? It\u2019s almost midnight.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol looked to me again, tearing her attention from the empty bar. \u201cYeah, well I finished work later than I wanted to. I was going to come earlier, but Dr. Lawson had other plans\u2026 anyway, I thought I\u2019d drop by and see if you were still open.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We\u2019re not,\u201c I teased. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She gave me a knowing look. \"You\u2019re not gonna kick me out\u2026 right?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I laughed, heading to the bar. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to kick you out. It\u2019s sweet you stopped by. But I can\u2019t really chat because I have to finish cleaning up before I leave.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can help with that,\u201c she offered, taking a seat on the stool at the bar. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d I assured her, finishing stacking the remaining glasses. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working all day. You should go home and get some sleep. Don\u2019t you have early starts?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I haven\u2019t seen you all day though,\u201c she reasoned, standing up, \"so if I have to help you clean up to have a conversation with you, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I quirked an eyebrow at her and she merely smiled cheekily. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What\u2019s first, boss?\u201c she asked.</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I rolled my eyes playfully before nodding to the disinfectant and cloth sitting on one of the tables. \"You wanna start wiping down surfaces?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She saluted me. \u201cAye, aye, Capt-\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don\u2019t finish that sentence, you nerd,\u201c I said, laughing now. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She flashed me a beautiful smile before getting to work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of us spent the next hour cleaning up the place and it was anything but boring. We put some music on from the jukebox and sang along to help make things more fun. I was glad to have Carol there, even if she <i>was</i> pretending that she wasn\u2019t tired from work. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She ended up driving me home afterwards, in her newly bought pickup truck, and walked me to my front door like a gentlewoman. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks again for helping me out tonight,\u201d I said, a small smile playing on my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My pleasure,\u201c she said. \"You working tomorrow evening?\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.\u201c</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see you after work then,\u201d she promised, smiling down at me before stepping forward and hugging me. \u201cGoodnight, Y/N.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I returned the hug, revelling in her warmth and the sweet smell of her perfume. \u201cGoodnight, Carol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She pulled away, smiling at me, and I froze when her eyes met mine. She hesitated, still holding me, as her eyes flickered down to my lips and my heart started to beat faster. Was she finally going to do it?</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Except she didn\u2019t. She cleared her throat and pulled away, smiling awkwardly. She nodded my way before turning to leave, except I wasn\u2019t having it. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, calling, \u201cCarol.\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She turned around and I wasted no time in grabbing her dog tag and using it to drag her towards me, before kissing her. I kept ahold of her and closed my eyes, growing warm when she began to kiss me back, resting her hand on my face. She was gentle and careful and I found myself smiling when we pulled apart, breathlessly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Goodnight, Carol,\u201c I said, my lips tingling. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She breathed out, biting her lower lip to contain her smile. \"Goodnight, Y/N.\u201d </p><p>***</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From that night onwards, Carol and I officially became girlfriends. Maria knew and that was about it because of the world we lived in, but I didn\u2019t care because I had Carol and that was enough. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, this is where you work,\u201c I said, my voice echoing in the hangar where the planes were stored. \"This is awesome.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I watched as Carol jumped out from one of the plane\u2019s cockpits at the sound of my voice. She seemed confused at first, until she realised it was me and a smile formed on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How did you get in here?\u201c she asked, approaching me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maria let me in,\u201d I explained, wrapping my arms around her waist, knowing we were alone so we could act normally. \u201cI wanted to see you at work and she said it was okay.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, this is the best surprise I\u2019ve had all day,\u201c she admitted, eyes meeting mine and glistening with happiness. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What, no kiss?\u201d I teased, raising an eyebrow. \u201cOr do I have to make the first move?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She sighed, a smile playing on her lips. \u201cYou ever gonna let me live that one down?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ever since our first kiss, I would use any chance I could to embarrass Carol about the fact that she wimped out last second. It always made her embarrassed, but I loved it because she was too cute about the whole thing. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I chuckled, shaking my head. \u201cNever. And I believe it went something like this\u2026\u201d I grabbed her dog tag and pulled her closer before pressing my lips to hers, feeling a surge of butterflies in my stomach at the taste of her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, never gets old,\u201c I joked when we pulled apart, making her smile. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We grew closer from there on out and I fell in love with the pilot, admitting it after a few months had passed. We stayed in a relationship for a year, until something happened. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I knew about her job and I always tried to understand when she rambled excitedly about new projects she was working on with Dr. Lawson, but she either spoke too fast or went on about things I didn\u2019t get, so I never questioned her. She was happy, so I was happy. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And I guess I blamed myself because maybe if I listened to her, I could\u2019ve understood how dangerous her mission was and stopped her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But I didn\u2019t listen, and one day, after leaving for a special mission, she kissed me goodbye and never came back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I found out from Maria, who was as heartbroken as I was. Except I wasn\u2019t just heartbroken, I was fuming. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told her to come back safely,\u201d I got out through salty tears. I was holding Carol\u2019s dog tag, the metal half-melted from the crash. It was the only thing they recovered of Carol, and Maria wanted me to have it. \u201cShe was supposed to come back.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It wasn\u2019t a safe flight,\u201c Maria said, her energy drained. \"I should\u2019ve stopped her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\u201c I asked, snapping my head to Maria. \"It wasn\u2019t safe?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria shook her head, her own tears falling. \u201cIt was a test flight. It was just supposed to be Lawson doing it, but Carol just had to help her.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I clenched my jaw, growing angry at everything. The world, God, Carol. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She lied to me,\u201c I growled, clutching the dog tag. \"She told me it was a simple flight. She\u2026 she lied\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She probably didn\u2019t want to worry you, Y/N,\u201c Maria tried to reassure me, but I was too pissed to care for her words. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d I yelled, before throwing the dog tag across the room. \u201cI don\u2019t want that. I hate Carol for lying to me. She left! She should be here! She said she would be back and she fucking lied! She fucking lied\u2026\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was crying now, sobbing into my hands. I felt Maria wrap her arms around me, pulling me in for a hug. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She said she\u2019d be back,\u201c I muttered between sobs. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, sweetie, I know,\u201d Maria cooed, rubbing soothing circles on my back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hate her\u2026\u201c </p><p>*** </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Six years had passed since that moment, that moment when I lost one of the few people in my life whom I loved dearly. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ended up going to university, studying business management and getting my degree. I was now partners with Pancho and had helped him franchise his business, opening two bars across North America. It all worked out. <i>Almost</i>. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It hurt at first, losing Carol, because I was constantly trying to fight the anger I held for her for leaving and lying to me. I avoided talking about her, even with Maria and Monica. It hurt too much. But when I went to university, all I could think about was Carol. She was the reason I\u2019d gone in the first place and I wished she was there to see me. But she wasn\u2019t. So, when I graduated, I tried my hardest to forget about her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was going well, until Maria explained to me that she was back. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was back and in fact had never died. She\u2019d been here for a few days now, but Maria hadn\u2019t told me because she needed to make sure, for my sake. But it was real and Carol was alive. Part alien with superpowers, but alive. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She\u2019s beginning to remember things,\u201d Maria explained from across me at her kitchen table. \u201cShe remembers you. Well, who you are to her. She\u2019s waiting outside right now, but you don\u2019t have to see her if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I ran my hand through my hair, still trying to grasp the concept that Carol was here. Maria had explained everything she\u2019d been through and I was adjusting, but I was so confused to how I felt. I was, of course, over the moon that she was alive this whole time. I was still hurting though, frustrated and pissed at her for leaving. Yeah, it wasn\u2019t her fault, but she\u2019d lied to me. I don\u2019t know, I needed to blame someone. It was the only logical thing I could do all these years without going insane with grief. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019ll see her,\u201c I said to Maria. \"Let\u2019s go.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria nodded, giving me an encouraging smile, before leading me outside. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol was sat at Maria\u2019s workbench in the back garden, messing around with the tools. When she heard us approaching though, she stood up and stepped forward. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I gasped a little, shocked that she was really there. All these years and she was back. She looked the same, save for her longer hair. Still as beautiful as ever. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, Y/N,\u201c she spoke first, her voice penetrating through me like a shard of broken glass. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotions. I thought I was okay with this, with her being back. But seeing her stood before me with a small smile on her annoyingly stunning face, alive and very much not dead, pissed me off. All the anger from the past six years built up and bubbled to the surface as she awaited my response. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I didn\u2019t even realise I\u2019d punched her square in the face until she was clutching her cheek with her hand and Maria had stepped between us. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N!\u201d Maria shouted, glaring at me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I widened my eyes, realising what I\u2019d done. \u201cShit, sorry!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I probably deserved that,\u201c she said, breathing out. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You definitely deserved that, but I shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d I admitted, staring at her. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y/N!\u201c Maria chastised. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol raised a thumb up, still holding her cheek and flinching. \"I\u2019m fine, I just need some ice\u2013 <i>ah</i>!\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria took us both inside into the kitchen and gave Carol some frozen peas to place on her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, I\u2019ll leave you both to talk <i>if </i>you promise not to hit her again,\u201c Maria said, giving me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I nodded from my seat beside Carol. \"It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good,\u201c she said, before softening her expression. \"You got this.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria left and Carol and I were left alone in the kitchen, awkwardly sat by one another as she held a pack of frozen peas to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To be fair, every superhero I\u2019ve ever heard of doesn\u2019t feel pain,\u201c I spoke first, shrugging my shoulders. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m not a superhero,\u201d Carol replied, meeting my eyes with her hazel ones. I thought I\u2019d never look into them again, but here I was. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s not what Monica\u2019s been saying.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol gave me a knowing look. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My tense expression softened. \"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually here\u2026 I was so angry at you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That much is obvious,\u201c she mumbled. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You left, Carol,\u201d I told her, shaking my head. \u201cYou lied to me saying it wasn\u2019t dangerous and you left. All that they recovered from the stupid crash was your stupid dog tag.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201c she spoke softly, eyes never leaving mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I swallowed the lump in my throat. \"I loved you.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You left.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I <i>hated </i>you.\u201c </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She didn\u2019t reply, instead she looked down at her hands with sad eyes. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I sighed, managing to push back any tears I thought would come. \"What happens now? You back for good?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That\u2019s the plan,\u201c she said, her shoulders sagging. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re just gonna go back into the Air Force? They think you\u2019re dead.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head, looking up again and dropping her hand to her lap, with the frozen peas in, revealing her purple-red cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have other priorities now,\u201c she said. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet, myself not knowing what to say. Instead, I frowned at her cheek, courtesy of me. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologised, grabbing the frozen peas from her hand and dragging my chair closer to hers so I could hold the frozen bag to her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It\u2019s okay,\u201c she said, eyes flickering to mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It went quiet again, and I realised how close we were when I felt her warm breath tickling my skin. I held her gaze, noting the beautiful golden flecks shining back at me. I felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she hesitated, her eyes moving to my lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d I said, moving the frozen peas from her cheek. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes met mine again. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kiss me,\u201c I deadpanned. \"You\u2019re going to stare at me. You\u2019ll want to do it. Then you\u2019ll decide not to for whatever reason.\u201d She seemed confused as she listened, so I continued. \u201cYou did the same thing when we first kissed. Or should I say, when <i>I</i> first kissed <i>you</i>.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I remember,\u201c she spoke gently. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprised to hear that, but I kept my cool as I gave her a knowing look. \"Yeah, well, you\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why?\u201c she asked, not daring to move away. \"Because you say so?\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I shook my head. \u201cNo, because even though you\u2019ve been in space for six years, I still know you, Carol, and I know you won\u2019t d\u2013\u201d</p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carol moved forward to silence me, pressing her lips to mine in a hasty kiss. I was surprised at her abruptness and newfound confidence, but closed my eyes when I realised how long it had been since I\u2019d felt her lips against mine. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She held the nape of my neck, pulling me closer to her as she deepened the kiss, slipping her tongue between my lips and making me gasp quietly. My heart was pounding in my chest, unable to catch up with the fact that the woman I hadn\u2019t stopped loving these past six years was kissing me like she had never stopped loving me, too. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, we pulled away from each other, breathlessly, with our foreheads resting against one another. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You were saying?\u201c she muttered, and a small smile was forming on her lips. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I almost cried as I smiled at her. \"I guess I have a lot more to learn about you, Danvers.\u201d </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I can\u2019t wait to know you all over again, Y/L/N,\u201c she admitted, eyes peering through mine, making me believe that maybe, things were going to be okay. </p><p> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wasn\u2019t so angry anymore.</p>",

When I placed them back, my eyes drifted to the dog tag hung around the blonde&rsquo;s neck, similar to the ones I&rsquo;d seen some of the Air Force guys wearing around Pancho&rsquo;s the past few days. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re in the Air Force,&rdquo; I blurted out accidentally. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blonde met my eyes and gave me a confused smile. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kind of having to follow through with what I was saying, I nodded to her dog tag. &ldquo;The dog tag. Air Force, right? From the base near here?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She chuckled and nodded. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s really cool,&ldquo; I said, smiling impressively. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You think?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Well, yeah,&ldquo; I said, sure of myself. \"I mean, you must be doing something you love, even with all of these&hellip;&rdquo; I looked around the bar, at all the obnoxious, self-righteous men who were also part of the Air Force, &ldquo;&hellip;<i>obstacles</i> in the way.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blonde laughed and I smiled at the sound. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I guess,&ldquo; she said with a shrug, taking a sip of her beer before nodding to me. \"What about you, though? Surely you&rsquo;re doing something you love?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I snickered, leaning back against the counter behind me. &ldquo;More like the only thing I&rsquo;m good at.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I challenged her expression with a humoured smile. &ldquo;Well, my dad was an alcoholic, so yeah, the only thing I&rsquo;m pretty much good at is preparing drinks.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blonde raised her eyebrows, surprised. &ldquo;Shit, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I waved her off. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s something to joke about.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The stranger straightened up, leaning forward as she stared up at me with hopeful eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you could do something more if you put your mind to it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;m saving up for something, but I don&rsquo;t know what yet.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled, her eyes squinting gorgeously. &ldquo;There you go then.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I returned the smile, a newfound interest developing in this complete stranger who I&rsquo;d somehow just shared parts of my life with that nobody really knew. My eyes flickered down to her dog tag, which I found intriguing, and I stood up straight. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Can I see it?&ldquo; I asked curiously. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She realised I was looking at her dog tag and nodded, saying, \"Sure,&rdquo; before pulling it from around her neck and holding it out for me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled excitedly and took it from her, leaning on the bar in front of her and studying it closely. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Carol Danvers,&ldquo; I read aloud, before looking up, a little surprised to see her hazel eyes studying me closely. \"Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I handed it back to her, watching as she pulled it around her neck and lifted her hair that was caught. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You, too&hellip;,&ldquo; she said, before raising an eyebrow. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N Y/L/N,&rdquo; I filled in, standing up with a smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N Y/L/N,&ldquo; she repeated, and I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it then, but my name sounded good coming from her lips. \"You&rsquo;re new here, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"As of a few days ago,&ldquo; I said, before jokingly adding, \"They just couldn&rsquo;t resist my amazing drink-making skills.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, can I get a drink over here?!&ldquo; someone called from the other end of the bar, ruining the moment. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Duty calls,&rdquo; I mumbled, giving Carol one last smile before leaving to serve another customer. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of my shift that evening wasn&rsquo;t as bad compared to the past few days, since Carol and her friend, Maria, were there to keep me company. It was nice to be able to talk to customers who weren&rsquo;t checking me out or flirting with me whilst half-drunk. Plus, they were lovely ladies who were <i>amazingly </i>cool pilots. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two women stopped by quite frequently and I learnt they were regulars, as were most of their team on the Air Force. It was fun talking to them when they came every few evenings, and I was beginning to look forward to their arrival when they came since they made my shift a whole lot better. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Especially Carol, who I was growing fond of. She was funny and confident and I was trying ever so hard to figure out if she was into girls or not, because there were moments - glances or little touches - between us that felt more than &lsquo;friendly&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t want to assume though, so I never really pursued it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was one evening when it wasn&rsquo;t that busy and Carol and Maria were there, keeping me company. We were talking about whether it was better going out to watch a film or to rent one and stay in - silly, but that&rsquo;s what we happened to be talking about. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"We should get going,&ldquo; Maria said, checking the time on her watch. \"Monica&rsquo;s babysitter leaves at eight.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Monica was Maria&rsquo;s kid, whom she&rsquo;d mentioned countless times. I&rsquo;d never met her, but she sounded adorable by the way her and Carol described her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, well it was nice seeing you guys again!&ldquo; I said with a smile, watching as Maria got up. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Er, is it cool if I stay for a little longer? I&rsquo;ll catch the bus home,&rdquo; Carol said, looking up at Maria. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was happening, but after a few exchanged glances between them both, Maria nodded, smiling at us both. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Okay, I&rsquo;ll see you later, Carol. See ya, Y/N!&ldquo; she said, waving at us both. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I waved goodbye and watched her leave before looking to Carol with a teasing smile. \"Are my ever-so-interesting topics of conversation too much for you to resist that you chose to stay, Danvers?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol bit her lip to contain her laugh. &ldquo;Yeah. You nailed it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her choosing to stay that evening told me all I needed to know - she was interested. </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was wiping the empty tables down with a cloth when I heard the front door open. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, Carol,&ldquo; Pancho, the owner, called from the bar, \"good to see you!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned around, surprised to see Carol here during the day. She was smiling in Pancho&rsquo;s direction.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, Pancho,&ldquo; she said, \"you, too.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She met my eyes and smiled wider, approaching me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&ldquo; she greeted. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey&hellip;,&rdquo; I replied, still a little confused. I smiled with amusement, asking, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Well, you said you had breaks at lunch, and I was off from work today, so I was wondering if you wanted to grab a bite to eat,&ldquo; she explained. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave her a playful smile. \"Now how can I say no to that when you&rsquo;ve made the trip here?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rolled her eyes, but a smile ghosted her lips, making me laugh. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Give me a few minutes and I&rsquo;ll be out,&ldquo; I told her, to which she nodded. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I finished up the last table and went into the back to return the cleaning supplies, before grabbing my jacket, feeling a little excited to spend some more time with Carol one on one. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ll be back in an hour, Pancho,&rdquo; I called out to the owner as I joined Carol by the door. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ll see you then, Y/N,&ldquo; he said with a smile.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to Carol. \"Ready?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled. &ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two of us left the bar and I saw a few cars parked up, probably belonging to the few customers inside currently. Carol led us to a dusty old pickup truck and I nodded my head with admiration. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Nice truck.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol shrugged. \"It&rsquo;s not really mine. I borrowed it from Maria.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled, suppressing the urge to laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first date and you&rsquo;re not even gonna <i>try </i>to lie? Props to you, Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She widened her eyes nervously. &ldquo;I- er- f-first date?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My smile faded as I realised I&rsquo;d interpreted this all wrong. &ldquo;Oh, er, I thought that- I mean, it just seemed like you were asking me out. I can go back inside and pretend this didn&rsquo;t happen if you want.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was already backing up awkwardly when she rested a hand on my arm, stopping me from going further. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No, no, I mean, stay,&ldquo; she got out, meeting my eyes. \"A date. Yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She mirrored my smile, relaxing a little. &ldquo;Yeah. But I was only planning on taking you to Burger King or something, so that&rsquo;s a pretty shit first date.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed. &ldquo;Burger King sounds perfect, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She breathed out with relief before motioning for me to go to the truck. &ldquo;After you then.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol drove us to the nearest Burger King, the two of singing along to whatever was on the radio. It was nice and I was glad I&rsquo;d misinterpreted the whole thing because it seemed like she wanted to ask me out, but didn&rsquo;t know how. She was so confident with everything she did, so it was refreshing to see her grow nervous over the little things. Adorable, actually. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After getting our food and taking a seat in one of the booth&rsquo;s, I dug into my fries hungrily.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"So, I figured out what I&rsquo;m saving up for finally,&ldquo; I spoke first, glancing at Carol. \"If you&rsquo;re interested.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol gave me a knowing look. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m interested, Y/N. So, what is it?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I slurped my drink before saying, &ldquo;College.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She grinned opposite me. &ldquo;Y/N, that&rsquo;s amazing!&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled to myself. &ldquo;Yeah, it is&hellip; I never really got to go because, well, my dad was a drunken mess. But now my savings are building up and I realised I want to learn. To do something I&rsquo;m passionate about.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol watched me with a heartwarming smile. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pulled a face. &ldquo;Okay, so I haven&rsquo;t exactly figured that out yet&hellip;&rdquo; Carol laughed and I slapped her hand gently, before continuing, &ldquo;&hellip;but I&rsquo;ve got time. I&rsquo;m still saving up, and I&rsquo;ve got a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m gonna figure out. Figure out what I enjoy. Kinda like you with flying.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol&rsquo;s eyes glistened as she stared at me, making my heart beat a little faster. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s seriously amazing, Y/N. You should be so proud of yourself.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m getting there,&ldquo; I joked, making her shake her head with amusement. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I continued eating, a comfortable silence settling between us, before I decided to speak again. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Out of curiosity, if you didn&rsquo;t think this was a date, what did you think it was? You just wanted to get lunch with me?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her cheeks flushed a little as she nodded. &ldquo;Well, yeah.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I bit my lip to contain my amusement. &ldquo;You made the trip to see me and caught me on my break. You also remembered specifically when that was, when I&rsquo;ve only mentioned it once. Also, we&rsquo;ve never really hung out outside of Pancho&rsquo;s before. Did you think that&rsquo;s what friends did?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol&rsquo;s cheeks were pink now and she smiled with embarrassment, looking down to her food. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Because that&rsquo;s a little gay, Carol,&ldquo; I whispered playfully, aware that there were others around us who might hear. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol shook her head, avoiding my eyes as I laughed at how cute she looked. Finally, she met my eyes with a knowing smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"For a person who isn&rsquo;t sure what what she wants in life, you&rsquo;re very confident when it comes to all of <i>this </i>stuff.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I cocked my head to the side, grinning at her. &ldquo;Gee, thanks, Danvers.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol and I went on a few more dates after that, all of them going just as well as the last. I was seriously starting to develop feelings for this woman, but none of us had made <i>the </i>move yet. I wanted her to kiss me, but she hadn&rsquo;t yet and I was wondering when the time would come. If it would ever come. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One evening, I was in the midst of closing up Pancho&rsquo;s for the night, having cleared out the last few customers not long ago. I&rsquo;d just finished washing all the glasses and was stacking them on the shelves and under the counter when I heard a knocking on the doors.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"We&rsquo;re closed!&ldquo; I called out, putting a glass down under the counter before standing up to see who it was. Carol stood there, smiling and waving at me adorably from the other side of the doors. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chuckled and headed to the door to unlock it. I noticed she was wearing her pilot uniform when she walked in, her dog tag around her neck like it was the first time we met. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey,&rdquo; she greeted with a smile, before looking around with surprise. &ldquo;Wow, it looks creepy in here when it&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, smiling at the blonde. &ldquo;What are you doing here, Carol? It&rsquo;s almost midnight.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol looked to me again, tearing her attention from the empty bar. &ldquo;Yeah, well I finished work later than I wanted to. I was going to come earlier, but Dr. Lawson had other plans&hellip; anyway, I thought I&rsquo;d drop by and see if you were still open.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"We&rsquo;re not,&ldquo; I teased. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave me a knowing look. \"You&rsquo;re not gonna kick me out&hellip; right?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I laughed, heading to the bar. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to kick you out. It&rsquo;s sweet you stopped by. But I can&rsquo;t really chat because I have to finish cleaning up before I leave.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I can help with that,&ldquo; she offered, taking a seat on the stool at the bar. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You don&rsquo;t need to do that,&rdquo; I assured her, finishing stacking the remaining glasses. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working all day. You should go home and get some sleep. Don&rsquo;t you have early starts?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I haven&rsquo;t seen you all day though,&ldquo; she reasoned, standing up, \"so if I have to help you clean up to have a conversation with you, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I quirked an eyebrow at her and she merely smiled cheekily. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What&rsquo;s first, boss?&ldquo; she asked.</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I rolled my eyes playfully before nodding to the disinfectant and cloth sitting on one of the tables. \"You wanna start wiping down surfaces?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She saluted me. &ldquo;Aye, aye, Capt-&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Don&rsquo;t finish that sentence, you nerd,&ldquo; I said, laughing now. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She flashed me a beautiful smile before getting to work. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two of us spent the next hour cleaning up the place and it was anything but boring. We put some music on from the jukebox and sang along to help make things more fun. I was glad to have Carol there, even if she <i>was</i> pretending that she wasn&rsquo;t tired from work. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She ended up driving me home afterwards, in her newly bought pickup truck, and walked me to my front door like a gentlewoman. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Thanks again for helping me out tonight,&rdquo; I said, a small smile playing on my lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"My pleasure,&ldquo; she said. \"You working tomorrow evening?&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Yeah.&ldquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ll see you after work then,&rdquo; she promised, smiling down at me before stepping forward and hugging me. &ldquo;Goodnight, Y/N.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I returned the hug, revelling in her warmth and the sweet smell of her perfume. &ldquo;Goodnight, Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pulled away, smiling at me, and I froze when her eyes met mine. She hesitated, still holding me, as her eyes flickered down to my lips and my heart started to beat faster. Was she finally going to do it?</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Except she didn&rsquo;t. She cleared her throat and pulled away, smiling awkwardly. She nodded my way before turning to leave, except I wasn&rsquo;t having it. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, calling, &ldquo;Carol.&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned around and I wasted no time in grabbing her dog tag and using it to drag her towards me, before kissing her. I kept ahold of her and closed my eyes, growing warm when she began to kiss me back, resting her hand on my face. She was gentle and careful and I found myself smiling when we pulled apart, breathlessly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Goodnight, Carol,&ldquo; I said, my lips tingling. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She breathed out, biting her lower lip to contain her smile. \"Goodnight, Y/N.&rdquo; </p><p>***</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From that night onwards, Carol and I officially became girlfriends. Maria knew and that was about it because of the world we lived in, but I didn&rsquo;t care because I had Carol and that was enough. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"So, this is where you work,&ldquo; I said, my voice echoing in the hangar where the planes were stored. \"This is awesome.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I watched as Carol jumped out from one of the plane&rsquo;s cockpits at the sound of my voice. She seemed confused at first, until she realised it was me and a smile formed on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"How did you get in here?&ldquo; she asked, approaching me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Maria let me in,&rdquo; I explained, wrapping my arms around her waist, knowing we were alone so we could act normally. &ldquo;I wanted to see you at work and she said it was okay.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Well, this is the best surprise I&rsquo;ve had all day,&ldquo; she admitted, eyes meeting mine and glistening with happiness. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What, no kiss?&rdquo; I teased, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;Or do I have to make the first move?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed, a smile playing on her lips. &ldquo;You ever gonna let me live that one down?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ever since our first kiss, I would use any chance I could to embarrass Carol about the fact that she wimped out last second. It always made her embarrassed, but I loved it because she was too cute about the whole thing. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I chuckled, shaking my head. &ldquo;Never. And I believe it went something like this&hellip;&rdquo; I grabbed her dog tag and pulled her closer before pressing my lips to hers, feeling a surge of butterflies in my stomach at the taste of her lips against mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Ah, never gets old,&ldquo; I joked when we pulled apart, making her smile. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We grew closer from there on out and I fell in love with the pilot, admitting it after a few months had passed. We stayed in a relationship for a year, until something happened. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew about her job and I always tried to understand when she rambled excitedly about new projects she was working on with Dr. Lawson, but she either spoke too fast or went on about things I didn&rsquo;t get, so I never questioned her. She was happy, so I was happy. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And I guess I blamed myself because maybe if I listened to her, I could&rsquo;ve understood how dangerous her mission was and stopped her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I didn&rsquo;t listen, and one day, after leaving for a special mission, she kissed me goodbye and never came back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I found out from Maria, who was as heartbroken as I was. Except I wasn&rsquo;t just heartbroken, I was fuming. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I told her to come back safely,&rdquo; I got out through salty tears. I was holding Carol&rsquo;s dog tag, the metal half-melted from the crash. It was the only thing they recovered of Carol, and Maria wanted me to have it. &ldquo;She was supposed to come back.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It wasn&rsquo;t a safe flight,&ldquo; Maria said, her energy drained. \"I should&rsquo;ve stopped her.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"What?&ldquo; I asked, snapping my head to Maria. \"It wasn&rsquo;t safe?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maria shook her head, her own tears falling. &ldquo;It was a test flight. It was just supposed to be Lawson doing it, but Carol just had to help her.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I clenched my jaw, growing angry at everything. The world, God, Carol. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"She lied to me,&ldquo; I growled, clutching the dog tag. \"She told me it was a simple flight. She&hellip; she lied&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"She probably didn&rsquo;t want to worry you, Y/N,&ldquo; Maria tried to reassure me, but I was too pissed to care for her words. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"No! That&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; I yelled, before throwing the dog tag across the room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that. I hate Carol for lying to me. She left! She should be here! She said she would be back and she fucking lied! She fucking lied&hellip;&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was crying now, sobbing into my hands. I felt Maria wrap her arms around me, pulling me in for a hug. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"She said she&rsquo;d be back,&ldquo; I muttered between sobs. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I know, sweetie, I know,&rdquo; Maria cooed, rubbing soothing circles on my back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I hate her&hellip;&ldquo; </p><p>*** </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Six years had passed since that moment, that moment when I lost one of the few people in my life whom I loved dearly. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up going to university, studying business management and getting my degree. I was now partners with Pancho and had helped him franchise his business, opening two bars across North America. It all worked out. <i>Almost</i>. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It hurt at first, losing Carol, because I was constantly trying to fight the anger I held for her for leaving and lying to me. I avoided talking about her, even with Maria and Monica. It hurt too much. But when I went to university, all I could think about was Carol. She was the reason I&rsquo;d gone in the first place and I wished she was there to see me. But she wasn&rsquo;t. So, when I graduated, I tried my hardest to forget about her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was going well, until Maria explained to me that she was back. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was back and in fact had never died. She&rsquo;d been here for a few days now, but Maria hadn&rsquo;t told me because she needed to make sure, for my sake. But it was real and Carol was alive. Part alien with superpowers, but alive. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"She&rsquo;s beginning to remember things,&rdquo; Maria explained from across me at her kitchen table. &ldquo;She remembers you. Well, who you are to her. She&rsquo;s waiting outside right now, but you don&rsquo;t have to see her if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ran my hand through my hair, still trying to grasp the concept that Carol was here. Maria had explained everything she&rsquo;d been through and I was adjusting, but I was so confused to how I felt. I was, of course, over the moon that she was alive this whole time. I was still hurting though, frustrated and pissed at her for leaving. Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t her fault, but she&rsquo;d lied to me. I don&rsquo;t know, I needed to blame someone. It was the only logical thing I could do all these years without going insane with grief. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;ll see her,&ldquo; I said to Maria. \"Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maria nodded, giving me an encouraging smile, before leading me outside. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol was sat at Maria&rsquo;s workbench in the back garden, messing around with the tools. When she heard us approaching though, she stood up and stepped forward. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gasped a little, shocked that she was really there. All these years and she was back. She looked the same, save for her longer hair. Still as beautiful as ever. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Hey, Y/N,&ldquo; she spoke first, her voice penetrating through me like a shard of broken glass. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suddenly felt overwhelmed with emotions. I thought I was okay with this, with her being back. But seeing her stood before me with a small smile on her annoyingly stunning face, alive and very much not dead, pissed me off. All the anger from the past six years built up and bubbled to the surface as she awaited my response. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even realise I&rsquo;d punched her square in the face until she was clutching her cheek with her hand and Maria had stepped between us. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N!&rdquo; Maria shouted, glaring at me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I widened my eyes, realising what I&rsquo;d done. &ldquo;Shit, sorry!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I probably deserved that,&ldquo; she said, breathing out. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You definitely deserved that, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; I admitted, staring at her. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Y/N!&ldquo; Maria chastised. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol raised a thumb up, still holding her cheek and flinching. \"I&rsquo;m fine, I just need some ice&ndash; <i>ah</i>!&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maria took us both inside into the kitchen and gave Carol some frozen peas to place on her cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Right, I&rsquo;ll leave you both to talk <i>if </i>you promise not to hit her again,&ldquo; Maria said, giving me a knowing look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded from my seat beside Carol. \"It won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Good,&ldquo; she said, before softening her expression. \"You got this.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maria left and Carol and I were left alone in the kitchen, awkwardly sat by one another as she held a pack of frozen peas to her cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"To be fair, every superhero I&rsquo;ve ever heard of doesn&rsquo;t feel pain,&ldquo; I spoke first, shrugging my shoulders. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m not a superhero,&rdquo; Carol replied, meeting my eyes with her hazel ones. I thought I&rsquo;d never look into them again, but here I was. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s not what Monica&rsquo;s been saying.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol gave me a knowing look. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My tense expression softened. \"I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re actually here&hellip; I was so angry at you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That much is obvious,&ldquo; she mumbled. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You left, Carol,&rdquo; I told her, shaking my head. &ldquo;You lied to me saying it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous and you left. All that they recovered from the stupid crash was your stupid dog tag.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m sorry,&ldquo; she spoke softly, eyes never leaving mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I swallowed the lump in my throat. \"I loved you.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I know. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You left.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I know.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I <i>hated </i>you.&ldquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t reply, instead she looked down at her hands with sad eyes. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sighed, managing to push back any tears I thought would come. \"What happens now? You back for good?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"That&rsquo;s the plan,&ldquo; she said, her shoulders sagging. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re just gonna go back into the Air Force? They think you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head, looking up again and dropping her hand to her lap, with the frozen peas in, revealing her purple-red cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I have other priorities now,&ldquo; she said. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It went quiet, myself not knowing what to say. Instead, I frowned at her cheek, courtesy of me. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I apologised, grabbing the frozen peas from her hand and dragging my chair closer to hers so I could hold the frozen bag to her cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"It&rsquo;s okay,&ldquo; she said, eyes flickering to mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It went quiet again, and I realised how close we were when I felt her warm breath tickling my skin. I held her gaze, noting the beautiful golden flecks shining back at me. I felt a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as she hesitated, her eyes moving to my lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You&rsquo;re not going to do it,&rdquo; I said, moving the frozen peas from her cheek. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes met mine again. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Kiss me,&ldquo; I deadpanned. \"You&rsquo;re going to stare at me. You&rsquo;ll want to do it. Then you&rsquo;ll decide not to for whatever reason.&rdquo; She seemed confused as she listened, so I continued. &ldquo;You did the same thing when we first kissed. Or should I say, when <i>I</i> first kissed <i>you</i>.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"I remember,&ldquo; she spoke gently. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was surprised to hear that, but I kept my cool as I gave her a knowing look. \"Yeah, well, you&rsquo;re not going to do it.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Why?&ldquo; she asked, not daring to move away. \"Because you say so?&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shook my head. &ldquo;No, because even though you&rsquo;ve been in space for six years, I still know you, Carol, and I know you won&rsquo;t d&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carol moved forward to silence me, pressing her lips to mine in a hasty kiss. I was surprised at her abruptness and newfound confidence, but closed my eyes when I realised how long it had been since I&rsquo;d felt her lips against mine. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She held the nape of my neck, pulling me closer to her as she deepened the kiss, slipping her tongue between my lips and making me gasp quietly. My heart was pounding in my chest, unable to catch up with the fact that the woman I hadn&rsquo;t stopped loving these past six years was kissing me like she had never stopped loving me, too. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, we pulled away from each other, breathlessly, with our foreheads resting against one another. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"You were saying?&ldquo; she muttered, and a small smile was forming on her lips. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I almost cried as I smiled at her. \"I guess I have a lot more to learn about you, Danvers.&rdquo; </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"And I can&rsquo;t wait to know you all over again, Y/L/N,&ldquo; she admitted, eyes peering through mine, making me believe that maybe, things were going to be okay. </p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t so angry anymore.</p>",
