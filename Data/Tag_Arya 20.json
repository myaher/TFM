                "content": "<p><h2>Gendrya Foreshadowing: A Storm of Swords</h2><p>&ldquo;Riverrun.&rdquo; Gendry put the hammer down and looked at her. &ldquo;You look different now. Like a proper little girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I look like an oak tree, with all these stupid acorns.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice though. A nice oak tree.&rdquo; He stepped closer, and <i>sniffed</i> at her.  &ldquo;You even smell nice for a change.&rdquo; </p><p><b>Okay, Gendry.  We see you.  You laughed at her at dinner with Lady Smallwood, but now you&rsquo;re really looking at her and dare I say&hellip;becoming a bit smitten?</b></p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t. You <i>stink</i>.&rdquo; Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run, but Gendry caught her arm.  She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him, but he yanked her down with him, and they rolled across the floor of the smithy.  He was very strong, but she was quicker.  Every time he tried to hold her still she wriggled free and punched him.  Gendry only laughed at the blows, which made her mad.  He finally caught both her wrists in one hand and started to tickle her with the other, so Arya slammed her knee between his legs. And wrenched free.  Both of them were covered in dirt, and one sleeve was torn on her stupid acorn dress.  &ldquo;I bet I don&rsquo;t look so nice <i>now</i>,&rdquo; she shouted.</p><p><b>There&rsquo;s a lot in this section.  My first thought was that this chapter comes right on the heels of Jaime&rsquo;s chapter in which he and Brienne have their epic sword fight.  Many people liken that battle to a symbolic sex scene, as well as just one those moments that heightens a possible enemies to lovers trope.  In this case with Arya and Gendry, it&rsquo;s a toned down, ridiculously cute glimpse at what could be in their future.  Gendry tickles her and wrestles with her, not out to hurt her in the least, but merely to tease.  Arya truly attempts fighting back because at this point, she honestly thinks he&rsquo;s laughing at her and being an annoying boy, and thus wants to prove herself and get away.
