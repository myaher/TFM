I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a soliloquy that might feature Emilia Clarke\u2019s most poignant and understated acting of her career. It\u2019s so soft. So delicate. She\u2019s so desperately alone and she needs him so badly. Why can\u2019t he see that?</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t want it.\u201d He growls back at her. Thick and low and missing every point.</p>\n\n<p>And now Daenerys has to drive the point home because this bumpkin cannot grasp it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you want. You didn\u2019t want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim and take what is mine?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He\u2019s shocked by this. Because he\u2019s so idealistic and never sees the inherent greed and evil in men. I have always loved Jon Snow for this innocence and this nobility and this belief in his fellow men.</p>\n\n<p>But now it\u2019s dangerous to Daenerys. It\u2019s foolhardy. But he doesn\u2019t know that. There is no duplicity at play and because of that, this scene actually works. Two characters have goal which cannot intersect peacefully. He needs above all else, to be a Stark. To be Ned\u2019s son. And to hold to the familial values that he was raised upon.</p>\n\n<p>And she knows the minds of men. She knows that for some reason, she is not the sovereign that Westeros wants. She has seen it first hand. She isn\u2019t making this up. It\u2019s not a paranoia or a delusion. Her dream is slipping away and the main culprit, unintentionally, is kneeling in front of her, too daft to see the obvious writing on the wall. Daenerys has already done the math, but Jon can\u2019t add.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;&hellip;.]</p>\n\n<p>And this is the moment where we know it\u2019s over. Because if this is Ygritte? Jon keeps that secret. I would bet my bottom dollar on it. If Ygritte asks him for this one favor, he says yes. But the bonds with Dany, even though the show would have us believe that they\u2019re stronger, have been weakened by the revelation of his ancestry and the wrongness of their love.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t\u201d He says.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt will.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>She is flooded with emotion. He\u2019s not going to understand. She\u2019s losing this battle. It\u2019s so difficult to watch.</p>\n\n<p>She takes him by the shoulders now. Voice heavy with sadness, and she plays her last card. Something she\u2019s never before done in her whole life.</p>\n\n<p>SHE BEGS.</p>\n\n<p>She begs this oaf to listen and to trust her.</p>\n\n<p>She begs him to understand and to love her again, the way he did before he knew.</p>\n\n<p>She begs for the door to a future to reopen. A future where they both can find true happiness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never begged for anything. But I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t do this. Please.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If it\u2019s Ygritte, this conversation is over. Probably with a few threats to remove his testicles from his body for good measure. But even begging hasn\u2019t worked for Daenerys. The most powerful woman in the Known World, reduced to a beggar, for love for destiny and for her very survival.</p>\n\n<p>And Jon doesn\u2019t get it.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the angriest I\u2019ve ever been at him. Not because I have the capacity to turn my back on him. In that I\u2019m as stupid as he is. But because this is just a girl asking a boy to love her. This isn\u2019t about the goddamn Seven Kingdoms or some chair somewhere. This about them, their love and their future.</p>\n\n<p>And he\u2019s not with her.</p>\n\n<p>Jon puts her face in his mits and he tells her \u201cyou are my queen, nothing will change that. And they are my family, we can live together.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He smiles.</p>\n\n<p>She does not. Because she has begged and he has still refused her.</p>\n\n<p>And that brings out an ancient coldness in her. Again, not some manufactured Mad Queen asinine horseshit. True coldness for a man who doesn\u2019t have her fucking back. After all this. After she changed the world for him and saved him from ruin, personally, on multiple occasions. This fucking boor. This self important douchebag. He would be dead a dozen times over without her. And he still will not listen. Her coldness, her icy anger is warranted.</p>",
