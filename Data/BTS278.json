He knew he would agree with him in the end if he played his cards right, and the plan itself was sensible, but he knew for a fact you wouldn\u2019t believe that and defy him at any costs.</p><p><i>Ring.. Ring..</i></p><p>\u201cHello..?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s raspy voice answered the phone. Upon hearing the vibrations against the nightstand, he quickly reached over, reading the caller ID and hitting answer. He quickly yanked the sheets off his body, searched the floor for his sweatpants, dragging them up over his waist and disappearing into the hallway, being careful to not wake you in the process. </p><p>\u201cHey.. You up?\u201d Namjoon asked as he twirled around in his desk chair. \u201cI am now..\u201d Jungkook mumbled as he made a B-line for the kitchen downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy..\u201d Jungkook questioned, suddenly becoming more alert to the fact that it was indeed Namjoon calling and nothing good would probably arise from it. \u201cIt\u2019s Yoongi.. He\u2019s&hellip; active again.\u201d Namjoon breathed out. \u201cIt\u2019s soon.. We\u2019re running out of time..\u201d Namjoon explained. </p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, it was only followed by silence. For a moment, Namjoon had thought the call ended abruptly, but once he heard Jungkook draw in a breath, he braced himself for Jungkook\u2019s wrath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what does this mean? Cut the bullshit and tell me straight up.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s body stilled as he awaited Namjoon\u2019s explanation. \u201cWell\u2026 This kinda segways into another thing I called for.. It\u2019s about Y/N\u2026 She- \u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not. I don\u2019t know what it is or what you want but no. She\u2019s not getting involved again.\u201d Jungkook cursed over the phone. Did he really think he\u2019d agree to subjecting you to anything else after everything you\u2019d just been through? </p><p>Namjoon clicked his tongue and leaned forward on his desk, phone still in hand. \u201cCan you at least give me a damn chance to explain myself?\u201d Namjoon sighed, annoyed. Namjoon knew Jungkook would immediately shut the idea down, but he still tried to argue his way in. </p><p>Seeing as Jungkook didn\u2019t interrupt or say anything else in protest, Namjoon figured this was his chance to explain. Drawing a breath in, he began to explain. \u201cShe needs training.\u201d Namjoon appealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Jungkook quickly hissed. \u201cIs that even a question?\u201d Namjoon barked. \u201cTake a damn look at her kid. She\u2019s tiny, frail, and weak. She\u2019s no match for any of the shit that gets thrown at her for being with you.\u201d Namjoon objected. Jungkook felt a pang of guilt in his chest as he registered Namjoon\u2019s words. </p><p>Silence followed for a few moments before Jungkook gave in. \u201cWho.. would train her?\u201d Jungkook hesitated. The idea of someone back at base training you was out of the question considering Jungkook himself could barely handle it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou will. She\u2019s yours so why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Namjoon assured. \u201cPlus I\u2019m not trying to deal with you beating the shit out of someone every time they lay a damn hand on her even though that\u2019s clearly implied with training..\u201d Namjoon lectured. </p><p>Jungkook paused, leaning over to rest his elbows on the kitchen counter. The idea itself really wasn\u2019t bad. Jungkook of all people knew that first hand, having seen the things that happened to you because he wasn\u2019t there to protect you. He ran his hand through his messy hair, before deciding and answering Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cOkay.. I\u2019ll do it. But.. why now?\u201d Jungkook wondered. Namjoon took a deep breath in before responding. \u201cYoongi. We know he has a weak spot for her and we can use that..\u201d Namjoon explained slowly and carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course..\u201d Jungkook growled over the phone. He knew it would end up like this one way or another.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t give a damn about you or your safety, he only saw you as a pawn.. Something he could use and then discard. Not caring for what happens to you in the process.. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not getting involved in this again Namjoon. She just barely made it out and she\u2019s in no condition to go anywhere back into it.\u201d Jungkook fumed. Namjoon clutched his phone tighter in his hand, becoming more annoyed and angry by the minute.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s already involved Jungkook. Open your damn eyes. It\u2019s too late to play the savior. At least my option gives her a chance to survive and learn some shit about this life.\u201d Namjoon progressively began to get more and more heated. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep shielding her from it. Have her join and be able to fight back, because whether you like it or not, she\u2019s already in and there\u2019s no way of her getting out.\u201d Namjoon shouted over the phone.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook frowned, knowing part of what he said was true. You were already involved and there wasn\u2019t any way out. Or at least any way that didn\u2019t end up with you being dead.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, unsure of what to do or say. \u201cCome on kid. You know I\u2019m right. Give her a chance to survive in this mess. Because we both know she\u2019s not getting out.\u201d Namjoon pled. \u201c&hellip;Okay. I\u2019ll do it. But I get to call the shot for when she\u2019s ready..\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice faltered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Namjoon.. If she gets hurt in any way.. I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d Jungkook seethed. \u201cGood choice kid. I\u2019ll call you again at the end of the week. Start training her right away. The sooner the better..\u201d Namjoon stood from his desk, getting ready to call in for a meeting on the new plan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re doing this for her..\u201d Namjoon asserted before hanging up abruptly. </p><p>Jungkook let out an audible sigh and tossed his phone over onto the couch, not wanting to think at the moment. Was he really doing the right thing..? He questioned himself as he walked around the other side of the counter towards the fridge.\u00a0</p><p>How was he going to explain to you? What would you say or do? Jungkook ran his hands through his hair once more trying to settle his nerves as he began to make breakfast for you two, deciding that would be the best time to break the news.. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4hfPcoL1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"/></figure><p>You stirred around a few times, groaning as you slowly began to wake up. The light coming through the curtains was bright enough to cause you to rub at your eyes, shielding them from the sensitive rays.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you began to come to your senses. You pried your eyes open, taking in your surroundings and position when you realized what had just happened. You slept with Jungkook. </p><p>Your face instantly became a shade of deep red as you frantically searched the floor for your clothes, feeling vulnerable all alone in the sheets.</p><p>\u00a0Sliding out of bed, placing your feet on the cold floor, you noticed just how sore your legs became as you walked over to the dresser. Noticing one of the drawers was slightly open, you decided you\u2019d just change from whatever was in there.</p><p>Pulling a plain white shirt over your head and changing into underwear, you decided you looked decent enough, considering it was still early morning and you weren\u2019t planning to go anywhere anytime soon.\u00a0</p><p>Only then, as you ran your hands through your hair in an attempt to smooth the frizzy hairs, you realized Jungkook wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. </p><p>You furrowed your brows and quickly moved over to his side of the bed to see his phone was gone along with his sweatpants.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking maybe he just went to the bathroom, you began to make your way towards the door to the hallway, when the smell of eggs and bacon hit your nose. </p><p>Making your way down the hallway to the stairs, the aroma of the fresh food became stronger. Figuring it was Jungkook, you tried to quickly make your way down the stairs, but failed as your legs felt like jelly. Your face became another shade of light red as your mind kept wandering back to why and how your legs came to be in the state they are. </p><p>Once you made it down the stairs, you began to head to the kitchen where you came into view of his back facing you as he stood in front of the stove. You let a small smile form on your face, imagining all the mornings you two would share like this.. Making breakfast together, enjoying coffee and such.. Minus the pain in the legs.. </p><p>You slowly made your way over to him, trying your best to not make any noise and surprise him, but he was quicker than you. \u201cIf you wanna sneak up on someone you\u2019ve got to be more quiet than that.\u201d He snickered as you wrapped your arms around his bare torso from behind. </p><p>\u201cI tried my best, it\u2019s not exactly easy to walk anymore, thanks to you..\u201d You giggled as you smacked his back.\u00a0</p><p>Walking around to the other side of the counter, you pulled a chair out and watched as he finished up the eggs. Jungkook just smirked as he turned around, placing the last of the food he made onto the plates. </p><p>\u201cWell you asked for it..\u201d He chuckled as you hid your face in your hands as you sat at the table. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it was a team effort..\u201d You mumbled as he came to join you at the table, setting down your plate in front of you. \u201cWhatever you sayyyy\u2026\u201d Jungkook trailed along as he sat down opposite of you. </p><p>You two both sat and enjoyed your food as you made small talk, until Jungkook cleared his throat catching your attention. \u201cHmm?\u201d You questioned as you looked up at him, placing your fork down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo.. I wanted to talk to you about something..\u201d Jungkook informed as he set down his utensils as well. You scanned his face for any clues but all you were met with was a serious, yet somewhat comforting stare. </p><p>\u201cOkay..? What..?\u201d You questioned, shifting your legs to lean over on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s about Namjoon&hellip; \u201c He began, and you immediately frowned, fearing the worst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to train and join..\u201d Jungkook said placing his hands flat on the table. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You immediately choked up. \u201cLook I know it\u2019s-\u201d \u201cNo! No Jungkook I can\u2019t!\u201d You quickly retaliated, standing from your chair. </p><p>\u201cY/N babe listen to me, I will train you myself and i\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re with me the whole time..\u201d Jungkook explained as he stood from his chair, walking over to comfort you.\u00a0</p><p>You stood bewildered, staring at the floor empty. \u201cI can\u2019t do that Jungkook.. I can\u2019t do this..\u201d Your heart began to race at even the mere thought of it. </p><p>\u201cListen.. I know it\u2019s a lot to take in but I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you Y/N. This is for the best.. You have to trust me..\u201d Jungkook cupped your face in his hands, causing you to look up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you to be safe and be able to protect yourself if anything happens to me..\u201d Jungkook carrassed your face, tucking a small strand of hair behind your ear. </p><p>\u201cJungkook I can\u2019t.. I\u2019m not strong enough.. I can\u2019t do this.. I\u2019m not you.. I\u2019m not like you..\u201d Your eyes began to tear up. Jungkook\u2019s heart ached. \u201cLook.. I know it\u2019s scary.. But I\u2019ll be with you the whole time. I\u2019ll train you myself. It\u2019s all gonna be okay..\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your forehead as he pulled you into his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust me.. You know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it wasn\u2019t for the best.\u201d Jungkook softly whispered into your ear. You pressed your face further into Jungkook\u2019s chest, wiping your tears away with your free hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared..\u201d You admitted. \u201cI know. But I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Okay..?\u201d Jungkook gripped your shoulders, pulling you back to view your face. \u201cOkay..\u201d You breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook let a small smile form as he pulled you back into him. <i>Okay\u2026 It\u2019s all gonna be okay..

You need to react faster than that..\u201d Jungkook explained as he landed on top of you, with your arm pulled back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking trying Jungkook.. Maybe if this wasn\u2019t so rushed I could learn properly..\u201d You snapped back at him as you stood, brushing off your arms.\u00a0</p><p>You had been thrown down on the mat a good 6 times in a row now, not understanding the mistake being made. Namjoon had called back last week informing Jungkook that we had 2 weeks left to train before they had to bring you into base. </p><p>\t\u201cI know it\u2019s hard.. But this is the only way you\u2019ll get better.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over behind you. \u201cLook, you have your shoulder here by the time I\u2019m already within reach. It needs to be here, so you can reach my arm and then flip.\u201d Jungkook instructed as he placed his hands on your shoulder, turning your body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry it from that angle next time.\u201d Jungkook patted your back as he moved to stand in front of you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright..\u201d You breathed out, rolling your shoulders back. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d You announced. Jungkook nodded, giving a countdown. \u201cAlright\u2026 3..2..\u201d He breathed out as he then ran at you, pulling the same move as last time.\u00a0</p><p>Remembering the tip Jungkook gave you, you moved your shoulder to the right instead, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s arm and twisting it to pull him around.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking you finally did it and had the upperhand, you began to ease into it, until Jungkook thrashed and turned his body, landing a strike to your jaw. Of course it didn\u2019t hurt really bad, but still enough to piss you off even more. </p><p>\t\u201cThe hell was that?!\u201d You huffed, shoving him away from you. \u201cYou let your guard down.\u201d He simply responded. \u201cNever let your guard down until the enemy is down or dead.\u201d He clarified. You just glared at him from your spot on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake 5 and then we\u2019ll start weapon combat instead.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over to the wall, grabbing his water bottle. You pushed yourself up off the floor and out of the room to the bathroom, letting the door slam behind you. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4k3R6vG1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"/></figure><p>\tStanding in front of the mirror, you cupped some cold water from the sink and splashed it on your face. Letting the water droplets run off and fall back into the sink. Your face was red and sweaty in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>Grabbing one of the small towels from the rack, you wiped at your face, wiping away the small hair strands that had stuck to your face in the process.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you turned to see a small purple bruise forming on your jaw from where Jungkook struck you. You really wished at times like these you would\u2019ve just said no and stuck with it. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking back into the large practice room, you saw Jungkook leaned up against the wall, phone in hand, typing away. You just scoffed and proceeded to place your belongings back onto the floor and stand in the middle of the room. However, you noticed Jungkook pulled out a small cart with all sorts of pocket knives and sharp weapons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou done\u2026?\u201d You sarcastically commented as he looked up from his phone before hitting the screen once more and pocketing it. \u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He dismissed as he wheeled the cart over towards you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPick one.\u201d He abruptly commented as the cart came to a stop. \u201cThis again?\u201d You dreaded. Last time you failed miserably and left with all sorts of small cuts and lacerations.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook was ruthless during training but afterwards always seemed to make it up and baby you. You wondered why he even bothered to go so hard in the first place. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah. You need to get better. This is gonna be the majority of what you run into out there.\u201d Jungkook explained as he picked up a decent sized dagger. You scoffer once more, picking up a similar weapon before kicking the cart to the side. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s try the chokehold again.\u201d Jungkook announced. You immediately frowned. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally..? Don\u2019t you think we did that enough? You know I suck Jungkook.\u201d You pulled down the collar of your shirt, revealing all sorts of small cuts along your collarbones and base of your neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to train and keep working on it Y/N\u2026\u201d Jungkook whined and tossed his head back, having had this conversation plenty times before. \u201cJust follow my lead again..\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4knbPgK1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"/></figure><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next 2 hours or so consisted of you getting your ass kicked once again. You stood opposite of Jungkook, waiting for him to charge at you, giving it one more try. \u201cAlright.. 3..2..\u201d He began yet again, running full speed once he hit 1.\u00a0</p><p>You quickly tried to register the words he told you earlier, but it all slipped from your memory as he charged, aiming and successfully slicing down your upper arm. You let out a strong hiss and swung around at him before your yell startled him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFuck this! I\u2019m done!

Tears no longer brimming your eyes, but falling freely now. Small sniffles accompanying. Your arm stung like a bitch at the moment but you didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this..\u201d You cried to yourself as you leaned your head against the base of the tree. \u201cI\u2019m too weak\u2026\u201d You continued to weep as you wiped at your eyes and nose. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it all worth it anymore? Surely you couldn\u2019t do this. You weren\u2019t made for this life\u2026 but neither was Jungkook.. and you saw that. But he still manages and found a way to survive. You never gave him credit for it, but now that you experienced it first hand, he was so strong. Much stronger than you could ever and will ever be. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You just missed the simpler times. Working at that shitty motel.. Your biggest worry being school and not dying at any given moment.. You missed your friends\u2026 Family\u2026 Minji.. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be completely honest, you tried to just erase it from your memories. You weren\u2019t strong enough, or at least not yet to face it and face reality.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of her being dead, her body still laying there back at Taehyung\u2019s old base.. dying at the hands of him.. You thought surely it would\u2019ve been all fine.. Jungkook was there.. he promised to get you out, but that didn\u2019t mean anything for Minji you guessed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You still vividly remembered the look on her face when she first woke and saw you back at Taehyung\u2019s. You wished you were dead in that moment because it would\u2019ve been better than trying to explain the hell you\u2019ve gone through and now just involved her in. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be honest, still to this moment you wished you would\u2019ve. You wished it was you who Taehyung killed. You wished it wouldn\u2019t have been you who made it out amongst all the chaos you faced inside those walls. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jaebum sacrificed himself for.\u00a0</p><p>You wished it wasn\u2019t you who brought Jin face to face with death. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who cost a whole army their lives outside of Taehyung\u2019s base. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jungkook saved. <i>You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jungkook met. </i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4ldk9rl1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"/></figure><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You finally begun dragging yourself back inside when the sun had managed to make its way down. Wiping away the tears that lingered on your face and brushing off the dirt and grass. You headed back for the backdoor you left unlocked when you left earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Stepping back inside, you noticed Jungkook wasn\u2019t in the living room and decided he was probably still downstairs in the practice room or something. You didn\u2019t really care at the moment in all honesty. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trudging up the stairs, you made your way down the hall to the bathroom. Flipping the light switch on as you opened the door, you stepped in, closing the door behind you. Y</p><p>ou immediately walked over to the cabinet, pulling the small door open and taking out the first aid kit. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You set the small box down on the counter and reached for a small washcloth, running it under warm water and then wiping gently at your arm. You let out a small hiss as the cloth came into contact with your wound. You watched as the cloth slowly became a dark red as the blood left your skin. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grabbing a small amount of ointment and applying it over the cut, you grabbed a bandage and wrapped it around your arm, struggling to secure it at the end.\u00a0</p><p>Letting out a grunt and gripping the end tightly, you finally pulled the bandage tight and secured it. You headed back towards the door, flipping off the light and heading to yours and Jungkook&rsquo;s shared room.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning the knob with ease, you pushed the door open and let it close halfway behind you. You walked over and sat at the edge of the bed and began to untie your shoes.\u00a0</p><p>Tossing them in the corner of the room, and then changing into some leggings and a shirt. You ran a hand through your hair and went and sat back at the edge of the bed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scanning around the room a few times, there was still no sign of Jungkook. It felt somewhat weird you had to admit not being with him 24/7, but you figured you could use the hour or 2 away from each other.\u00a0</p><p>Glancing over at his side of the bed, you noticed he had a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the nightstand. Figuring it couldn\u2019t do much harm to you anymore, you let your misery get the best of you and decided to have one.</p><p>\u00a0Pulling the balcony door open, you grabbed the pack of cigarettes and lighter and stepped out. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the small object in between your two fingers, you guided it up to your mouth and took a long drag, before exhaling and blowing the white smoke back into the air.\u00a0</p><p>It tasted like shit and left your mouth feeling dry, but there was something oddly comforting and therapeutic about it. You could see why Jungkook did it almost every night. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which, as you went back to take another drag, you could hear footsteps approaching the bedroom followed by Jungkook calling out your name. \u201cY/N..?\u201d He called out, as he slowly pushed the bedroom door open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N are you alright..?\u201d Jungkook asked as he neared the balcony, wondering what you were doing outside. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t til he got closer he saw what was going on. You turned, cigarette in hand, about to answer, but got cut off abruptly. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d Jungkook scolded as he quickly walked out onto the balcony, smacking the cigarette out of your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d He scolded as he snatched the pack and lighter from the small table beside you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like.. or should I say what <i>did</i> it look like..\u201d You huffed back, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cThese things aren&rsquo;t good for you. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Jungkook glared at you as he shoved the pack in his back pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay dad\u2026\u201d You snapped, turning your back to him. \u201cWhy do you do it then huh? I\u2019m not a damn baby Jungkook. I can do whatever I want.\u201d You growl at him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jungkook snapped, grabbing your wrist and twirling you around to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?\u201d Jungkook furrowed his brows as he clutched your wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s wrong..\u201d You mumbled as you yanked your wrist free, walking back inside your room, Jungkook following hot on your trail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if I didn\u2019t think it was what\u2019s best for you Y/N. What\u2019s best for us.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he grabbed your wrist once more, dragging you over to sit on the bed with him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love you Y/N. You know I do. I just want you to be strong. To be able to protect yourself if I\u2019m not there.\u201d You let your hair fall in front of your eyes, not daring to face him. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing Jungkook. I\u2019m not strong. You again of all people should know that.\u201d You mumbled the last part. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut you are strong.\u201d Jungkook immediately fires back, taking your face in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t see it, but you\u2019ve been through hell and back and you\u2019re still here. You\u2019re still my girl. And if I thought even for a second that this training and plan would be of no good or bring harm to you, you know I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Jungkook brushed his thumb against your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust trust me Y/N please..\u201d He said placing his forehead against yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI..\u201d You began, but paused when the sound of car pulling up outside startled you both. \u201cWho\u2019s - ..?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cY/N kill the lights.. now.\u201d</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4mmQyRd1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"/></figure><p>(A/N: surprise! i finally updated lmfao sorry for the like 2 month hiatus again :\u2019) it was just a real rough time and i was too tired to do literally anything rip but school is coming back next week unfortunately so my upload schedule will probably still be all whack but ill try my best oof i hope you guys enjoy this chapter !!)</p>",

Upon hearing the vibrations against the nightstand, he quickly reached over, reading the caller ID and hitting answer. He quickly yanked the sheets off his body, searched the floor for his sweatpants, dragging them up over his waist and disappearing into the hallway, being careful to not wake you in the process. </p><p>\u201cHey.. You up?\u201d Namjoon asked as he twirled around in his desk chair. \u201cI am now..\u201d Jungkook mumbled as he made a B-line for the kitchen downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy..\u201d Jungkook questioned, suddenly becoming more alert to the fact that it was indeed Namjoon calling and nothing good would probably arise from it. \u201cIt\u2019s Yoongi..

We\u2019re running out of time..\u201d Namjoon explained. </p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, it was only followed by silence. For a moment, Namjoon had thought the call ended abruptly, but once he heard Jungkook draw in a breath, he braced himself for Jungkook\u2019s wrath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what does this mean? Cut the bullshit and tell me straight up.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s body stilled as he awaited Namjoon\u2019s explanation. \u201cWell\u2026 This kinda segways into another thing I called for..

Did he really think he\u2019d agree to subjecting you to anything else after everything you\u2019d just been through? </p><p>Namjoon clicked his tongue and leaned forward on his desk, phone still in hand. \u201cCan you at least give me a damn chance to explain myself?\u201d Namjoon sighed, annoyed. Namjoon knew Jungkook would immediately shut the idea down, but he still tried to argue his way in. </p><p>Seeing as Jungkook didn\u2019t interrupt or say anything else in protest, Namjoon figured this was his chance to explain. Drawing a breath in, he began to explain. \u201cShe needs training.\u201d Namjoon appealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Jungkook quickly hissed. \u201cIs that even a question?\u201d Namjoon barked. \u201cTake a damn look at her kid. She\u2019s tiny, frail, and weak. She\u2019s no match for any of the shit that gets thrown at her for being with you.\u201d Namjoon objected. Jungkook felt a pang of guilt in his chest as he registered Namjoon\u2019s words. </p><p>Silence followed for a few moments before Jungkook gave in. \u201cWho.. would train her?\u201d Jungkook hesitated. The idea of someone back at base training you was out of the question considering Jungkook himself could barely handle it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou will. She\u2019s yours so why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Namjoon assured. \u201cPlus I\u2019m not trying to deal with you beating the shit out of someone every time they lay a damn hand on her even though that\u2019s clearly implied with training..\u201d Namjoon lectured. </p><p>Jungkook paused, leaning over to rest his elbows on the kitchen counter. The idea itself really wasn\u2019t bad. Jungkook of all people knew that first hand, having seen the things that happened to you because he wasn\u2019t there to protect you. He ran his hand through his messy hair, before deciding and answering Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cOkay.. I\u2019ll do it. But.. why now?\u201d Jungkook wondered. Namjoon took a deep breath in before responding. \u201cYoongi. We know he has a weak spot for her and we can use that..\u201d Namjoon explained slowly and carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course..\u201d Jungkook growled over the phone. He knew it would end up like this one way or another.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t give a damn about you or your safety, he only saw you as a pawn.. Something he could use and then discard. Not caring for what happens to you in the process.. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not getting involved in this again Namjoon. She just barely made it out and she\u2019s in no condition to go anywhere back into it.\u201d Jungkook fumed. Namjoon clutched his phone tighter in his hand, becoming more annoyed and angry by the minute.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s already involved Jungkook. Open your damn eyes. It\u2019s too late to play the savior. At least my option gives her a chance to survive and learn some shit about this life.\u201d Namjoon progressively began to get more and more heated. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep shielding her from it. Have her join and be able to fight back, because whether you like it or not, she\u2019s already in and there\u2019s no way of her getting out.\u201d Namjoon shouted over the phone.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook frowned, knowing part of what he said was true. You were already involved and there wasn\u2019t any way out. Or at least any way that didn\u2019t end up with you being dead.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, unsure of what to do or say. \u201cCome on kid. You know I\u2019m right. Give her a chance to survive in this mess. Because we both know she\u2019s not getting out.\u201d Namjoon pled. \u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll do it. But I get to call the shot for when she\u2019s ready..\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice faltered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Namjoon.. If she gets hurt in any way.. I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d Jungkook seethed. \u201cGood choice kid. I\u2019ll call you again at the end of the week. Start training her right away. The sooner the better..\u201d Namjoon stood from his desk, getting ready to call in for a meeting on the new plan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re doing this for her..\u201d Namjoon asserted before hanging up abruptly. </p><p>Jungkook let out an audible sigh and tossed his phone over onto the couch, not wanting to think at the moment. Was he really doing the right thing..? He questioned himself as he walked around the other side of the counter towards the fridge.\u00a0</p><p>How was he going to explain to you? What would you say or do? Jungkook ran his hands through his hair once more trying to settle his nerves as he began to make breakfast for you two, deciding that would be the best time to break the news.. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4hfPcoL1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>You stirred around a few times, groaning as you slowly began to wake up. The light coming through the curtains was bright enough to cause you to rub at your eyes, shielding them from the sensitive rays.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you began to come to your senses. You pried your eyes open, taking in your surroundings and position when you realized what had just happened. You slept with Jungkook. </p><p>Your face instantly became a shade of deep red as you frantically searched the floor for your clothes, feeling vulnerable all alone in the sheets.</p><p>\u00a0Sliding out of bed, placing your feet on the cold floor, you noticed just how sore your legs became as you walked over to the dresser. Noticing one of the drawers was slightly open, you decided you\u2019d just change from whatever was in there.</p><p>Pulling a plain white shirt over your head and changing into underwear, you decided you looked decent enough, considering it was still early morning and you weren\u2019t planning to go anywhere anytime soon.\u00a0</p><p>Only then, as you ran your hands through your hair in an attempt to smooth the frizzy hairs, you realized Jungkook wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. </p><p>You furrowed your brows and quickly moved over to his side of the bed to see his phone was gone along with his sweatpants.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking maybe he just went to the bathroom, you began to make your way towards the door to the hallway, when the smell of eggs and bacon hit your nose. </p><p>Making your way down the hallway to the stairs, the aroma of the fresh food became stronger. Figuring it was Jungkook, you tried to quickly make your way down the stairs, but failed as your legs felt like jelly. Your face became another shade of light red as your mind kept wandering back to why and how your legs came to be in the state they are. </p><p>Once you made it down the stairs, you began to head to the kitchen where you came into view of his back facing you as he stood in front of the stove. You let a small smile form on your face, imagining all the mornings you two would share like this.. Making breakfast together, enjoying coffee and such.. Minus the pain in the legs.. </p><p>You slowly made your way over to him, trying your best to not make any noise and surprise him, but he was quicker than you. \u201cIf you wanna sneak up on someone you\u2019ve got to be more quiet than that.\u201d He snickered as you wrapped your arms around his bare torso from behind. </p><p>\u201cI tried my best, it\u2019s not exactly easy to walk anymore, thanks to you..\u201d You giggled as you smacked his back.\u00a0</p><p>Walking around to the other side of the counter, you pulled a chair out and watched as he finished up the eggs. Jungkook just smirked as he turned around, placing the last of the food he made onto the plates. </p><p>\u201cWell you asked for it..\u201d He chuckled as you hid your face in your hands as you sat at the table. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it was a team effort..\u201d You mumbled as he came to join you at the table, setting down your plate in front of you. \u201cWhatever you sayyyy\u2026\u201d Jungkook trailed along as he sat down opposite of you. </p><p>You two both sat and enjoyed your food as you made small talk, until Jungkook cleared his throat catching your attention. \u201cHmm?\u201d You questioned as you looked up at him, placing your fork down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo.. I wanted to talk to you about something..\u201d Jungkook informed as he set down his utensils as well. You scanned his face for any clues but all you were met with was a serious, yet somewhat comforting stare. </p><p>\u201cOkay..? What..?\u201d You questioned, shifting your legs to lean over on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s about Namjoon\u2026 \u201c He began, and you immediately frowned, fearing the worst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to train and join..\u201d Jungkook said placing his hands flat on the table. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You immediately choked up. \u201cLook I know it\u2019s-\u201d \u201cNo! No Jungkook I can\u2019t!\u201d You quickly retaliated, standing from your chair. </p><p>\u201cY/N babe listen to me, I will train you myself and i\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re with me the whole time..\u201d Jungkook explained as he stood from his chair, walking over to comfort you.\u00a0</p><p>You stood bewildered, staring at the floor empty. \u201cI can\u2019t do that Jungkook.. I can\u2019t do this..\u201d Your heart began to race at even the mere thought of it. </p><p>\u201cListen.. I know it\u2019s a lot to take in but I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you Y/N. This is for the best.. You have to trust me..\u201d Jungkook cupped your face in his hands, causing you to look up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you to be safe and be able to protect yourself if anything happens to me..\u201d Jungkook carrassed your face, tucking a small strand of hair behind your ear. </p><p>\u201cJungkook I can\u2019t.. I\u2019m not strong enough.. I can\u2019t do this.. I\u2019m not you.. I\u2019m not like you..\u201d Your eyes began to tear up. Jungkook\u2019s heart ached. \u201cLook.. I know it\u2019s scary.. But I\u2019ll be with you the whole time. I\u2019ll train you myself. It\u2019s all gonna be okay..\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your forehead as he pulled you into his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust me.. You know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it wasn\u2019t for the best.\u201d Jungkook softly whispered into your ear. You pressed your face further into Jungkook\u2019s chest, wiping your tears away with your free hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared..\u201d You admitted. \u201cI know. But I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Okay..?\u201d Jungkook gripped your shoulders, pulling you back to view your face. \u201cOkay..\u201d You breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook let a small smile form as he pulled you back into him. <i>Okay\u2026 It\u2019s all gonna be okay.. He won\u2019t let anything happen..</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4iyuMBl1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p><i><b>-\u00a0 2 weeks later \u00a0\u00a0- </b></i></p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d You yelled out as your back hit the mat once again. \u201cYou keep dropping your shoulder too low Y/N.. You need to react faster than that..\u201d Jungkook explained as he landed on top of you, with your arm pulled back.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking trying Jungkook.. Maybe if this wasn\u2019t so rushed I could learn properly..\u201d You snapped back at him as you stood, brushing off your arms.\u00a0</p><p>You had been thrown down on the mat a good 6 times in a row now, not understanding the mistake being made. Namjoon had called back last week informing Jungkook that we had 2 weeks left to train before they had to bring you into base. </p><p>\t\u201cI know it\u2019s hard.. But this is the only way you\u2019ll get better.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over behind you. \u201cLook, you have your shoulder here by the time I\u2019m already within reach. It needs to be here, so you can reach my arm and then flip.\u201d Jungkook instructed as he placed his hands on your shoulder, turning your body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry it from that angle next time.\u201d Jungkook patted your back as he moved to stand in front of you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright..\u201d You breathed out, rolling your shoulders back. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d You announced. Jungkook nodded, giving a countdown. \u201cAlright\u2026 3..2..\u201d He breathed out as he then ran at you, pulling the same move as last time.\u00a0</p><p>Remembering the tip Jungkook gave you, you moved your shoulder to the right instead, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s arm and twisting it to pull him around.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking you finally did it and had the upperhand, you began to ease into it, until Jungkook thrashed and turned his body, landing a strike to your jaw. Of course it didn\u2019t hurt really bad, but still enough to piss you off even more. </p><p>\t\u201cThe hell was that?!\u201d You huffed, shoving him away from you. \u201cYou let your guard down.\u201d He simply responded. \u201cNever let your guard down until the enemy is down or dead.\u201d He clarified. You just glared at him from your spot on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake 5 and then we\u2019ll start weapon combat instead.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over to the wall, grabbing his water bottle. You pushed yourself up off the floor and out of the room to the bathroom, letting the door slam behind you. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4k3R6vG1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>\tStanding in front of the mirror, you cupped some cold water from the sink and splashed it on your face. Letting the water droplets run off and fall back into the sink. Your face was red and sweaty in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>Grabbing one of the small towels from the rack, you wiped at your face, wiping away the small hair strands that had stuck to your face in the process.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you turned to see a small purple bruise forming on your jaw from where Jungkook struck you. You really wished at times like these you would\u2019ve just said no and stuck with it. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking back into the large practice room, you saw Jungkook leaned up against the wall, phone in hand, typing away. You just scoffed and proceeded to place your belongings back onto the floor and stand in the middle of the room. However, you noticed Jungkook pulled out a small cart with all sorts of pocket knives and sharp weapons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou done\u2026?\u201d You sarcastically commented as he looked up from his phone before hitting the screen once more and pocketing it. \u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He dismissed as he wheeled the cart over towards you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPick one.\u201d He abruptly commented as the cart came to a stop. \u201cThis again?\u201d You dreaded. Last time you failed miserably and left with all sorts of small cuts and lacerations.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook was ruthless during training but afterwards always seemed to make it up and baby you. You wondered why he even bothered to go so hard in the first place. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah. You need to get better. This is gonna be the majority of what you run into out there.\u201d Jungkook explained as he picked up a decent sized dagger. You scoffer once more, picking up a similar weapon before kicking the cart to the side. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s try the chokehold again.\u201d Jungkook announced. You immediately frowned. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally..? Don\u2019t you think we did that enough? You know I suck Jungkook.\u201d You pulled down the collar of your shirt, revealing all sorts of small cuts along your collarbones and base of your neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to train and keep working on it Y/N\u2026\u201d Jungkook whined and tossed his head back, having had this conversation plenty times before. \u201cJust follow my lead again..\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4knbPgK1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next 2 hours or so consisted of you getting your ass kicked once again. You stood opposite of Jungkook, waiting for him to charge at you, giving it one more try. \u201cAlright.. 3..2..\u201d He began yet again, running full speed once he hit 1.\u00a0</p><p>You quickly tried to register the words he told you earlier, but it all slipped from your memory as he charged, aiming and successfully slicing down your upper arm. You let out a strong hiss and swung around at him before your yell startled him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFuck this! I\u2019m done! I quit!\u201d You screamed out, dropping your weapon to the floor and kicking it away from you. \u201cY/N\u2026You-\u201c \u201cNo! No Jungkook! I\u2019m done! I\u2019m not strong enough I can\u2019t do this!\u201d You yelled out, throwing your hands in the air.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too weak..\u201d You mumbled as you quickly stormed off towards the door, causing Jungkook to grab at your non-injured forearm. \u201cWait.. you\u2019re bleeding..\u201d \u201cSo what..\u201d You quickly yanked your arm out of his reach and slammed the door as you left. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sitting up against a tree nearby, you finally let yourself collapse. Tears no longer brimming your eyes, but falling freely now. Small sniffles accompanying. Your arm stung like a bitch at the moment but you didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this..\u201d You cried to yourself as you leaned your head against the base of the tree. \u201cI\u2019m too weak\u2026\u201d You continued to weep as you wiped at your eyes and nose. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it all worth it anymore? Surely you couldn\u2019t do this. You weren\u2019t made for this life\u2026 but neither was Jungkook.. and you saw that. But he still manages and found a way to survive. You never gave him credit for it, but now that you experienced it first hand, he was so strong. Much stronger than you could ever and will ever be. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You just missed the simpler times. Working at that shitty motel.. Your biggest worry being school and not dying at any given moment.. You missed your friends\u2026 Family\u2026 Minji.. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be completely honest, you tried to just erase it from your memories. You weren\u2019t strong enough, or at least not yet to face it and face reality.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of her being dead, her body still laying there back at Taehyung\u2019s old base.. dying at the hands of him.. You thought surely it would\u2019ve been all fine.. Jungkook was there.. he promised to get you out, but that didn\u2019t mean anything for Minji you guessed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You still vividly remembered the look on her face when she first woke and saw you back at Taehyung\u2019s. You wished you were dead in that moment because it would\u2019ve been better than trying to explain the hell you\u2019ve gone through and now just involved her in. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be honest, still to this moment you wished you would\u2019ve. You wished it was you who Taehyung killed. You wished it wouldn\u2019t have been you who made it out amongst all the chaos you faced inside those walls. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jaebum sacrificed himself for.\u00a0</p><p>You wished it wasn\u2019t you who brought Jin face to face with death. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who cost a whole army their lives outside of Taehyung\u2019s base.

Wiping away the tears that lingered on your face and brushing off the dirt and grass. You headed back for the backdoor you left unlocked when you left earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Stepping back inside, you noticed Jungkook wasn\u2019t in the living room and decided he was probably still downstairs in the practice room or something. You didn\u2019t really care at the moment in all honesty. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trudging up the stairs, you made your way down the hall to the bathroom. Flipping the light switch on as you opened the door, you stepped in, closing the door behind you. Y</p><p>ou immediately walked over to the cabinet, pulling the small door open and taking out the first aid kit. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You set the small box down on the counter and reached for a small washcloth, running it under warm water and then wiping gently at your arm. You let out a small hiss as the cloth came into contact with your wound. You watched as the cloth slowly became a dark red as the blood left your skin. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grabbing a small amount of ointment and applying it over the cut, you grabbed a bandage and wrapped it around your arm, struggling to secure it at the end.\u00a0</p><p>Letting out a grunt and gripping the end tightly, you finally pulled the bandage tight and secured it. You headed back towards the door, flipping off the light and heading to yours and Jungkook\u2019s shared room.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning the knob with ease, you pushed the door open and let it close halfway behind you. You walked over and sat at the edge of the bed and began to untie your shoes.\u00a0</p><p>Tossing them in the corner of the room, and then changing into some leggings and a shirt. You ran a hand through your hair and went and sat back at the edge of the bed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scanning around the room a few times, there was still no sign of Jungkook. It felt somewhat weird you had to admit not being with him 24/7, but you figured you could use the hour or 2 away from each other.\u00a0</p><p>Glancing over at his side of the bed, you noticed he had a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the nightstand. Figuring it couldn\u2019t do much harm to you anymore, you let your misery get the best of you and decided to have one.</p><p>\u00a0Pulling the balcony door open, you grabbed the pack of cigarettes and lighter and stepped out. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the small object in between your two fingers, you guided it up to your mouth and took a long drag, before exhaling and blowing the white smoke back into the air.\u00a0</p><p>It tasted like shit and left your mouth feeling dry, but there was something oddly comforting and therapeutic about it. You could see why Jungkook did it almost every night. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which, as you went back to take another drag, you could hear footsteps approaching the bedroom followed by Jungkook calling out your name. \u201cY/N..?\u201d He called out, as he slowly pushed the bedroom door open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N are you alright..?\u201d Jungkook asked as he neared the balcony, wondering what you were doing outside. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t til he got closer he saw what was going on. You turned, cigarette in hand, about to answer, but got cut off abruptly. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d Jungkook scolded as he quickly walked out onto the balcony, smacking the cigarette out of your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d He scolded as he snatched the pack and lighter from the small table beside you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like.. or should I say what <i>did</i> it look like..\u201d You huffed back, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cThese things aren\u2019t good for you. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Jungkook glared at you as he shoved the pack in his back pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay dad\u2026\u201d You snapped, turning your back to him. \u201cWhy do you do it then huh? I\u2019m not a damn baby Jungkook. I can do whatever I want.\u201d You growl at him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jungkook snapped, grabbing your wrist and twirling you around to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?\u201d Jungkook furrowed his brows as he clutched your wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s wrong..\u201d You mumbled as you yanked your wrist free, walking back inside your room, Jungkook following hot on your trail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if I didn\u2019t think it was what\u2019s best for you Y/N. What\u2019s best for us.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he grabbed your wrist once more, dragging you over to sit on the bed with him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love you Y/N. You know I do. I just want you to be strong. To be able to protect yourself if I\u2019m not there.\u201d You let your hair fall in front of your eyes, not daring to face him. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing Jungkook. I\u2019m not strong. You again of all people should know that.\u201d You mumbled the last part. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut you are strong.\u201d Jungkook immediately fires back, taking your face in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t see it, but you\u2019ve been through hell and back and you\u2019re still here. You\u2019re still my girl. And if I thought even for a second that this training and plan would be of no good or bring harm to you, you know I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Jungkook brushed his thumb against your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust trust me Y/N please..\u201d He said placing his forehead against yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI..\u201d You began, but paused when the sound of car pulling up outside startled you both. \u201cWho\u2019s - ..?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cY/N kill the lights.. now.\u201d</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4mmQyRd1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>(A/N: surprise! i finally updated lmfao sorry for the like 2 month hiatus again :\u2019) it was just a real rough time and i was too tired to do literally anything rip but school is coming back next week unfortunately so my upload schedule will probably still be all whack but ill try my best oof i hope you guys enjoy this chapter !!)</p>",

He knew he would agree with him in the end if he played his cards right, and the plan itself was sensible, but he knew for a fact you wouldn\u2019t believe that and defy him at any costs.</p><p><i>Ring.. Ring..</i></p><p>\u201cHello..?\u201d Jungkook\u2019s raspy voice answered the phone. Upon hearing the vibrations against the nightstand, he quickly reached over, reading the caller ID and hitting answer. He quickly yanked the sheets off his body, searched the floor for his sweatpants, dragging them up over his waist and disappearing into the hallway, being careful to not wake you in the process. </p><p>\u201cHey.. You up?\u201d Namjoon asked as he twirled around in his desk chair. \u201cI am now..\u201d Jungkook mumbled as he made a B-line for the kitchen downstairs.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhy..\u201d Jungkook questioned, suddenly becoming more alert to the fact that it was indeed Namjoon calling and nothing good would probably arise from it. \u201cIt\u2019s Yoongi.. He\u2019s\u2026 active again.\u201d Namjoon breathed out. \u201cIt\u2019s soon.. We\u2019re running out of time..\u201d Namjoon explained. </p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, it was only followed by silence. For a moment, Namjoon had thought the call ended abruptly, but once he heard Jungkook draw in a breath, he braced himself for Jungkook\u2019s wrath.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo what does this mean? Cut the bullshit and tell me straight up.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s body stilled as he awaited Namjoon\u2019s explanation. \u201cWell\u2026 This kinda segways into another thing I called for.. It\u2019s about Y/N\u2026 She- \u201d </p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not. I don\u2019t know what it is or what you want but no. She\u2019s not getting involved again.\u201d Jungkook cursed over the phone. Did he really think he\u2019d agree to subjecting you to anything else after everything you\u2019d just been through? </p><p>Namjoon clicked his tongue and leaned forward on his desk, phone still in hand. \u201cCan you at least give me a damn chance to explain myself?\u201d Namjoon sighed, annoyed. Namjoon knew Jungkook would immediately shut the idea down, but he still tried to argue his way in. </p><p>Seeing as Jungkook didn\u2019t interrupt or say anything else in protest, Namjoon figured this was his chance to explain. Drawing a breath in, he began to explain. \u201cShe needs training.\u201d Namjoon appealed.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Jungkook quickly hissed. \u201cIs that even a question?\u201d Namjoon barked. \u201cTake a damn look at her kid. She\u2019s tiny, frail, and weak. She\u2019s no match for any of the shit that gets thrown at her for being with you.\u201d Namjoon objected. Jungkook felt a pang of guilt in his chest as he registered Namjoon\u2019s words. </p><p>Silence followed for a few moments before Jungkook gave in. \u201cWho.. would train her?\u201d Jungkook hesitated. The idea of someone back at base training you was out of the question considering Jungkook himself could barely handle it.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou will. She\u2019s yours so why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Namjoon assured. \u201cPlus I\u2019m not trying to deal with you beating the shit out of someone every time they lay a damn hand on her even though that\u2019s clearly implied with training..\u201d Namjoon lectured. </p><p>Jungkook paused, leaning over to rest his elbows on the kitchen counter. The idea itself really wasn\u2019t bad. Jungkook of all people knew that first hand, having seen the things that happened to you because he wasn\u2019t there to protect you. He ran his hand through his messy hair, before deciding and answering Namjoon. </p><p>\u201cOkay.. I\u2019ll do it. But.. why now?\u201d Jungkook wondered. Namjoon took a deep breath in before responding. \u201cYoongi. We know he has a weak spot for her and we can use that..\u201d Namjoon explained slowly and carefully.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOf course..\u201d Jungkook growled over the phone. He knew it would end up like this one way or another.\u00a0</p><p>Namjoon didn\u2019t give a damn about you or your safety, he only saw you as a pawn.. Something he could use and then discard. Not caring for what happens to you in the process.. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not getting involved in this again Namjoon. She just barely made it out and she\u2019s in no condition to go anywhere back into it.\u201d Jungkook fumed. Namjoon clutched his phone tighter in his hand, becoming more annoyed and angry by the minute.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s already involved Jungkook. Open your damn eyes. It\u2019s too late to play the savior. At least my option gives her a chance to survive and learn some shit about this life.\u201d Namjoon progressively began to get more and more heated. </p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep shielding her from it. Have her join and be able to fight back, because whether you like it or not, she\u2019s already in and there\u2019s no way of her getting out.\u201d Namjoon shouted over the phone.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook frowned, knowing part of what he said was true. You were already involved and there wasn\u2019t any way out. Or at least any way that didn\u2019t end up with you being dead.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, unsure of what to do or say. \u201cCome on kid. You know I\u2019m right. Give her a chance to survive in this mess. Because we both know she\u2019s not getting out.\u201d Namjoon pled. \u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll do it. But I get to call the shot for when she\u2019s ready..\u201d Jungkook\u2019s voice faltered.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI swear to god Namjoon.. If she gets hurt in any way.. I\u2019ll kill you myself.\u201d Jungkook seethed. \u201cGood choice kid. I\u2019ll call you again at the end of the week. Start training her right away. The sooner the better..\u201d Namjoon stood from his desk, getting ready to call in for a meeting on the new plan.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGood luck.. Don\u2019t forget you\u2019re doing this for her..\u201d Namjoon asserted before hanging up abruptly. </p><p>Jungkook let out an audible sigh and tossed his phone over onto the couch, not wanting to think at the moment. Was he really doing the right thing..? He questioned himself as he walked around the other side of the counter towards the fridge.\u00a0</p><p>How was he going to explain to you? What would you say or do? Jungkook ran his hands through his hair once more trying to settle his nerves as he began to make breakfast for you two, deciding that would be the best time to break the news.. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4hfPcoL1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>You stirred around a few times, groaning as you slowly began to wake up. The light coming through the curtains was bright enough to cause you to rub at your eyes, shielding them from the sensitive rays.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you began to come to your senses. You pried your eyes open, taking in your surroundings and position when you realized what had just happened. You slept with Jungkook. </p><p>Your face instantly became a shade of deep red as you frantically searched the floor for your clothes, feeling vulnerable all alone in the sheets.</p><p>\u00a0Sliding out of bed, placing your feet on the cold floor, you noticed just how sore your legs became as you walked over to the dresser. Noticing one of the drawers was slightly open, you decided you\u2019d just change from whatever was in there.</p><p>Pulling a plain white shirt over your head and changing into underwear, you decided you looked decent enough, considering it was still early morning and you weren\u2019t planning to go anywhere anytime soon.\u00a0</p><p>Only then, as you ran your hands through your hair in an attempt to smooth the frizzy hairs, you realized Jungkook wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen. </p><p>You furrowed your brows and quickly moved over to his side of the bed to see his phone was gone along with his sweatpants.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking maybe he just went to the bathroom, you began to make your way towards the door to the hallway, when the smell of eggs and bacon hit your nose. </p><p>Making your way down the hallway to the stairs, the aroma of the fresh food became stronger. Figuring it was Jungkook, you tried to quickly make your way down the stairs, but failed as your legs felt like jelly. Your face became another shade of light red as your mind kept wandering back to why and how your legs came to be in the state they are. </p><p>Once you made it down the stairs, you began to head to the kitchen where you came into view of his back facing you as he stood in front of the stove. You let a small smile form on your face, imagining all the mornings you two would share like this.. Making breakfast together, enjoying coffee and such.. Minus the pain in the legs.. </p><p>You slowly made your way over to him, trying your best to not make any noise and surprise him, but he was quicker than you. \u201cIf you wanna sneak up on someone you\u2019ve got to be more quiet than that.\u201d He snickered as you wrapped your arms around his bare torso from behind. </p><p>\u201cI tried my best, it\u2019s not exactly easy to walk anymore, thanks to you..\u201d You giggled as you smacked his back.\u00a0</p><p>Walking around to the other side of the counter, you pulled a chair out and watched as he finished up the eggs. Jungkook just smirked as he turned around, placing the last of the food he made onto the plates. </p><p>\u201cWell you asked for it..\u201d He chuckled as you hid your face in your hands as you sat at the table. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it was a team effort..\u201d You mumbled as he came to join you at the table, setting down your plate in front of you. \u201cWhatever you sayyyy\u2026\u201d Jungkook trailed along as he sat down opposite of you. </p><p>You two both sat and enjoyed your food as you made small talk, until Jungkook cleared his throat catching your attention. \u201cHmm?\u201d You questioned as you looked up at him, placing your fork down.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cSo.. I wanted to talk to you about something..\u201d Jungkook informed as he set down his utensils as well. You scanned his face for any clues but all you were met with was a serious, yet somewhat comforting stare. </p><p>\u201cOkay..? What..?\u201d You questioned, shifting your legs to lean over on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s about Namjoon\u2026 \u201c He began, and you immediately frowned, fearing the worst.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to train and join..\u201d Jungkook said placing his hands flat on the table. \u201cWhat?!\u201d You immediately choked up. \u201cLook I know it\u2019s-\u201d \u201cNo! No Jungkook I can\u2019t!\u201d You quickly retaliated, standing from your chair. </p><p>\u201cY/N babe listen to me, I will train you myself and i\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re with me the whole time..\u201d Jungkook explained as he stood from his chair, walking over to comfort you.\u00a0</p><p>You stood bewildered, staring at the floor empty. \u201cI can\u2019t do that Jungkook.. I can\u2019t do this..\u201d Your heart began to race at even the mere thought of it. </p><p>\u201cListen.. I know it\u2019s a lot to take in but I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you Y/N. This is for the best.. You have to trust me..\u201d Jungkook cupped your face in his hands, causing you to look up at him.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI want you to be safe and be able to protect yourself if anything happens to me..\u201d Jungkook carrassed your face, tucking a small strand of hair behind your ear. </p><p>\u201cJungkook I can\u2019t.. I\u2019m not strong enough.. I can\u2019t do this.. I\u2019m not you.. I\u2019m not like you..\u201d Your eyes began to tear up. Jungkook\u2019s heart ached. \u201cLook.. I know it\u2019s scary.. But I\u2019ll be with you the whole time. I\u2019ll train you myself. It\u2019s all gonna be okay..\u201d Jungkook pressed a kiss to your forehead as he pulled you into his chest.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust me.. You know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if it wasn\u2019t for the best.\u201d Jungkook softly whispered into your ear. You pressed your face further into Jungkook\u2019s chest, wiping your tears away with your free hand. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared..\u201d You admitted. \u201cI know. But I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. Okay..?\u201d Jungkook gripped your shoulders, pulling you back to view your face. \u201cOkay..\u201d You breathed out.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook let a small smile form as he pulled you back into him. <i>Okay\u2026 It\u2019s all gonna be okay..

Maybe if this wasn\u2019t so rushed I could learn properly..\u201d You snapped back at him as you stood, brushing off your arms.\u00a0</p><p>You had been thrown down on the mat a good 6 times in a row now, not understanding the mistake being made. Namjoon had called back last week informing Jungkook that we had 2 weeks left to train before they had to bring you into base. </p><p>\t\u201cI know it\u2019s hard.. But this is the only way you\u2019ll get better.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over behind you. \u201cLook, you have your shoulder here by the time I\u2019m already within reach. It needs to be here, so you can reach my arm and then flip.\u201d Jungkook instructed as he placed his hands on your shoulder, turning your body.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTry it from that angle next time.\u201d Jungkook patted your back as he moved to stand in front of you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAlright..\u201d You breathed out, rolling your shoulders back. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d You announced. Jungkook nodded, giving a countdown. \u201cAlright\u2026 3..2..\u201d He breathed out as he then ran at you, pulling the same move as last time.\u00a0</p><p>Remembering the tip Jungkook gave you, you moved your shoulder to the right instead, grabbing Jungkook\u2019s arm and twisting it to pull him around.\u00a0</p><p>Thinking you finally did it and had the upperhand, you began to ease into it, until Jungkook thrashed and turned his body, landing a strike to your jaw. Of course it didn\u2019t hurt really bad, but still enough to piss you off even more. </p><p>\t\u201cThe hell was that?!\u201d You huffed, shoving him away from you. \u201cYou let your guard down.\u201d He simply responded. \u201cNever let your guard down until the enemy is down or dead.\u201d He clarified. You just glared at him from your spot on the floor.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTake 5 and then we\u2019ll start weapon combat instead.\u201d Jungkook explained as he walked over to the wall, grabbing his water bottle. You pushed yourself up off the floor and out of the room to the bathroom, letting the door slam behind you. </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4k3R6vG1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>\tStanding in front of the mirror, you cupped some cold water from the sink and splashed it on your face. Letting the water droplets run off and fall back into the sink. Your face was red and sweaty in defeat.\u00a0</p><p>Grabbing one of the small towels from the rack, you wiped at your face, wiping away the small hair strands that had stuck to your face in the process.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cShit..\u201d You mumbled as you turned to see a small purple bruise forming on your jaw from where Jungkook struck you. You really wished at times like these you would\u2019ve just said no and stuck with it. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walking back into the large practice room, you saw Jungkook leaned up against the wall, phone in hand, typing away. You just scoffed and proceeded to place your belongings back onto the floor and stand in the middle of the room. However, you noticed Jungkook pulled out a small cart with all sorts of pocket knives and sharp weapons.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou done\u2026?\u201d You sarcastically commented as he looked up from his phone before hitting the screen once more and pocketing it. \u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He dismissed as he wheeled the cart over towards you. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPick one.\u201d He abruptly commented as the cart came to a stop. \u201cThis again?\u201d You dreaded. Last time you failed miserably and left with all sorts of small cuts and lacerations.\u00a0</p><p>Jungkook was ruthless during training but afterwards always seemed to make it up and baby you. You wondered why he even bothered to go so hard in the first place. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah. You need to get better. This is gonna be the majority of what you run into out there.\u201d Jungkook explained as he picked up a decent sized dagger. You scoffer once more, picking up a similar weapon before kicking the cart to the side. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s try the chokehold again.\u201d Jungkook announced. You immediately frowned. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cReally..? Don\u2019t you think we did that enough? You know I suck Jungkook.\u201d You pulled down the collar of your shirt, revealing all sorts of small cuts along your collarbones and base of your neck.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to train and keep working on it Y/N\u2026\u201d Jungkook whined and tossed his head back, having had this conversation plenty times before. \u201cJust follow my lead again..\u201d </p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4knbPgK1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next 2 hours or so consisted of you getting your ass kicked once again. You stood opposite of Jungkook, waiting for him to charge at you, giving it one more try. \u201cAlright.. 3..2..\u201d He began yet again, running full speed once he hit 1.\u00a0</p><p>You quickly tried to register the words he told you earlier, but it all slipped from your memory as he charged, aiming and successfully slicing down your upper arm. You let out a strong hiss and swung around at him before your yell startled him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFuck this! I\u2019m done! I quit!\u201d You screamed out, dropping your weapon to the floor and kicking it away from you. \u201cY/N\u2026You-\u201c \u201cNo! No Jungkook! I\u2019m done!

Tears no longer brimming your eyes, but falling freely now. Small sniffles accompanying. Your arm stung like a bitch at the moment but you didn\u2019t care anymore. </p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this..\u201d You cried to yourself as you leaned your head against the base of the tree. \u201cI\u2019m too weak\u2026\u201d You continued to weep as you wiped at your eyes and nose. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it all worth it anymore? Surely you couldn\u2019t do this. You weren\u2019t made for this life\u2026 but neither was Jungkook.. and you saw that. But he still manages and found a way to survive. You never gave him credit for it, but now that you experienced it first hand, he was so strong. Much stronger than you could ever and will ever be. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You just missed the simpler times. Working at that shitty motel.. Your biggest worry being school and not dying at any given moment.. You missed your friends\u2026 Family\u2026 Minji.. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be completely honest, you tried to just erase it from your memories. You weren\u2019t strong enough, or at least not yet to face it and face reality.\u00a0</p><p>The reality of her being dead, her body still laying there back at Taehyung\u2019s old base.. dying at the hands of him.. You thought surely it would\u2019ve been all fine.. Jungkook was there.. he promised to get you out, but that didn\u2019t mean anything for Minji you guessed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You still vividly remembered the look on her face when she first woke and saw you back at Taehyung\u2019s. You wished you were dead in that moment because it would\u2019ve been better than trying to explain the hell you\u2019ve gone through and now just involved her in. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be honest, still to this moment you wished you would\u2019ve. You wished it was you who Taehyung killed. You wished it wouldn\u2019t have been you who made it out amongst all the chaos you faced inside those walls. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jaebum sacrificed himself for.\u00a0</p><p>You wished it wasn\u2019t you who brought Jin face to face with death. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who cost a whole army their lives outside of Taehyung\u2019s base. You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jungkook saved. <i>You wished it wasn\u2019t you who Jungkook met. </i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4ldk9rl1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You finally begun dragging yourself back inside when the sun had managed to make its way down. Wiping away the tears that lingered on your face and brushing off the dirt and grass. You headed back for the backdoor you left unlocked when you left earlier.\u00a0</p><p>Stepping back inside, you noticed Jungkook wasn\u2019t in the living room and decided he was probably still downstairs in the practice room or something. You didn\u2019t really care at the moment in all honesty. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trudging up the stairs, you made your way down the hall to the bathroom. Flipping the light switch on as you opened the door, you stepped in, closing the door behind you. Y</p><p>ou immediately walked over to the cabinet, pulling the small door open and taking out the first aid kit. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You set the small box down on the counter and reached for a small washcloth, running it under warm water and then wiping gently at your arm. You let out a small hiss as the cloth came into contact with your wound. You watched as the cloth slowly became a dark red as the blood left your skin. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grabbing a small amount of ointment and applying it over the cut, you grabbed a bandage and wrapped it around your arm, struggling to secure it at the end.\u00a0</p><p>Letting out a grunt and gripping the end tightly, you finally pulled the bandage tight and secured it. You headed back towards the door, flipping off the light and heading to yours and Jungkook\u2019s shared room.</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning the knob with ease, you pushed the door open and let it close halfway behind you. You walked over and sat at the edge of the bed and began to untie your shoes.\u00a0</p><p>Tossing them in the corner of the room, and then changing into some leggings and a shirt. You ran a hand through your hair and went and sat back at the edge of the bed. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scanning around the room a few times, there was still no sign of Jungkook. It felt somewhat weird you had to admit not being with him 24/7, but you figured you could use the hour or 2 away from each other.\u00a0</p><p>Glancing over at his side of the bed, you noticed he had a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the nightstand. Figuring it couldn\u2019t do much harm to you anymore, you let your misery get the best of you and decided to have one.</p><p>\u00a0Pulling the balcony door open, you grabbed the pack of cigarettes and lighter and stepped out. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taking the small object in between your two fingers, you guided it up to your mouth and took a long drag, before exhaling and blowing the white smoke back into the air.\u00a0</p><p>It tasted like shit and left your mouth feeling dry, but there was something oddly comforting and therapeutic about it. You could see why Jungkook did it almost every night. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of which, as you went back to take another drag, you could hear footsteps approaching the bedroom followed by Jungkook calling out your name. \u201cY/N..?\u201d He called out, as he slowly pushed the bedroom door open.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cY/N are you alright..?\u201d Jungkook asked as he neared the balcony, wondering what you were doing outside. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It wasn\u2019t til he got closer he saw what was going on. You turned, cigarette in hand, about to answer, but got cut off abruptly. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d Jungkook scolded as he quickly walked out onto the balcony, smacking the cigarette out of your hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d He scolded as he snatched the pack and lighter from the small table beside you.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like.. or should I say what <i>did</i> it look like..\u201d You huffed back, crossing your arms over your chest. \u201cThese things aren\u2019t good for you. They\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Jungkook glared at you as he shoved the pack in his back pocket.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOkay dad\u2026\u201d You snapped, turning your back to him. \u201cWhy do you do it then huh? I\u2019m not a damn baby Jungkook. I can do whatever I want.\u201d You growl at him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jungkook snapped, grabbing your wrist and twirling you around to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?\u201d Jungkook furrowed his brows as he clutched your wrist.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s wrong..\u201d You mumbled as you yanked your wrist free, walking back inside your room, Jungkook following hot on your trail.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cYou already know I wouldn\u2019t be doing this if I didn\u2019t think it was what\u2019s best for you Y/N. What\u2019s best for us.\u201d Jungkook pleaded as he grabbed your wrist once more, dragging you over to sit on the bed with him. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI love you Y/N. You know I do. I just want you to be strong. To be able to protect yourself if I\u2019m not there.\u201d You let your hair fall in front of your eyes, not daring to face him. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing Jungkook. I\u2019m not strong. You again of all people should know that.\u201d You mumbled the last part. </p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut you are strong.\u201d Jungkook immediately fires back, taking your face in his hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t see it, but you\u2019ve been through hell and back and you\u2019re still here. You\u2019re still my girl. And if I thought even for a second that this training and plan would be of no good or bring harm to you, you know I wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Jungkook brushed his thumb against your cheek.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJust trust me Y/N please..\u201d He said placing his forehead against yours.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI..\u201d You began, but paused when the sound of car pulling up outside startled you both. \u201cWho\u2019s - ..?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<i>\u00a0\u00a0\u201cY/N kill the lights.. now.\u201d</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4mmQyRd1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"6\"></figure><p>(A/N: surprise! i finally updated lmfao sorry for the like 2 month hiatus again :\u2019) it was just a real rough time and i was too tired to do literally anything rip but school is coming back next week unfortunately so my upload schedule will probably still be all whack but ill try my best oof i hope you guys enjoy this chapter !!)</p>",

He knew he would agree with him in the end if he played his cards right, and the plan itself was sensible, but he knew for a fact you wouldn&rsquo;t believe that and defy him at any costs.</p><p><i>Ring.. Ring..</i></p><p>&ldquo;Hello..?&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s raspy voice answered the phone. Upon hearing the vibrations against the nightstand, he quickly reached over, reading the caller ID and hitting answer. He quickly yanked the sheets off his body, searched the floor for his sweatpants, dragging them up over his waist and disappearing into the hallway, being careful to not wake you in the process. </p><p>&ldquo;Hey.. You up?&rdquo; Namjoon asked as he twirled around in his desk chair. &ldquo;I am now..&rdquo; Jungkook mumbled as he made a B-line for the kitchen downstairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Why..&rdquo; Jungkook questioned, suddenly becoming more alert to the fact that it was indeed Namjoon calling and nothing good would probably arise from it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Yoongi.. He&rsquo;s&hellip; active again.&rdquo; Namjoon breathed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s soon.. We&rsquo;re running out of time..&rdquo; Namjoon explained. </p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, it was only followed by silence. For a moment, Namjoon had thought the call ended abruptly, but once he heard Jungkook draw in a breath, he braced himself for Jungkook&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So what does this mean? Cut the bullshit and tell me straight up.&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s body stilled as he awaited Namjoon&rsquo;s explanation. &ldquo;Well&hellip; This kinda segways into another thing I called for.. It&rsquo;s about Y/N&hellip; She- &rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;No. Absolutely not. I don&rsquo;t know what it is or what you want but no. She&rsquo;s not getting involved again.&rdquo; Jungkook cursed over the phone. Did he really think he&rsquo;d agree to subjecting you to anything else after everything you&rsquo;d just been through? </p><p>Namjoon clicked his tongue and leaned forward on his desk, phone still in hand. &ldquo;Can you at least give me a damn chance to explain myself?&rdquo; Namjoon sighed, annoyed. Namjoon knew Jungkook would immediately shut the idea down, but he still tried to argue his way in. </p><p>Seeing as Jungkook didn&rsquo;t interrupt or say anything else in protest, Namjoon figured this was his chance to explain. Drawing a breath in, he began to explain. &ldquo;She needs training.&rdquo; Namjoon appealed.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For?&rdquo; Jungkook quickly hissed. &ldquo;Is that even a question?&rdquo; Namjoon barked. &ldquo;Take a damn look at her kid. She&rsquo;s tiny, frail, and weak. She&rsquo;s no match for any of the shit that gets thrown at her for being with you.&rdquo; Namjoon objected. Jungkook felt a pang of guilt in his chest as he registered Namjoon&rsquo;s words. </p><p>Silence followed for a few moments before Jungkook gave in. &ldquo;Who.. would train her?&rdquo; Jungkook hesitated. The idea of someone back at base training you was out of the question considering Jungkook himself could barely handle it.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You will. She&rsquo;s yours so why wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Namjoon assured. &ldquo;Plus I&rsquo;m not trying to deal with you beating the shit out of someone every time they lay a damn hand on her even though that&rsquo;s clearly implied with training..&rdquo; Namjoon lectured. </p><p>Jungkook paused, leaning over to rest his elbows on the kitchen counter. The idea itself really wasn&rsquo;t bad. Jungkook of all people knew that first hand, having seen the things that happened to you because he wasn&rsquo;t there to protect you. He ran his hand through his messy hair, before deciding and answering Namjoon. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay.. I&rsquo;ll do it. But.. why now?&rdquo; Jungkook wondered. Namjoon took a deep breath in before responding. &ldquo;Yoongi. We know he has a weak spot for her and we can use that..&rdquo; Namjoon explained slowly and carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course..&rdquo; Jungkook growled over the phone. He knew it would end up like this one way or another.&nbsp;</p><p>Namjoon didn&rsquo;t give a damn about you or your safety, he only saw you as a pawn.. Something he could use and then discard. Not caring for what happens to you in the process.. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not getting involved in this again Namjoon. She just barely made it out and she&rsquo;s in no condition to go anywhere back into it.&rdquo; Jungkook fumed. Namjoon clutched his phone tighter in his hand, becoming more annoyed and angry by the minute.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already involved Jungkook. Open your damn eyes. It&rsquo;s too late to play the savior. At least my option gives her a chance to survive and learn some shit about this life.&rdquo; Namjoon progressively began to get more and more heated. </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep shielding her from it. Have her join and be able to fight back, because whether you like it or not, she&rsquo;s already in and there&rsquo;s no way of her getting out.&rdquo; Namjoon shouted over the phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Jungkook frowned, knowing part of what he said was true. You were already involved and there wasn&rsquo;t any way out. Or at least any way that didn&rsquo;t end up with you being dead.</p><p>Jungkook stayed silent, unsure of what to do or say. &ldquo;Come on kid. You know I&rsquo;m right. Give her a chance to survive in this mess. Because we both know she&rsquo;s not getting out.&rdquo; Namjoon pled. &ldquo;&hellip;Okay. I&rsquo;ll do it. But I get to call the shot for when she&rsquo;s ready..&rdquo; Jungkook&rsquo;s voice faltered.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear to god Namjoon.. If she gets hurt in any way.. I&rsquo;ll kill you myself.&rdquo; Jungkook seethed. &ldquo;Good choice kid. I&rsquo;ll call you again at the end of the week. Start training her right away. The sooner the better..&rdquo; Namjoon stood from his desk, getting ready to call in for a meeting on the new plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good luck.. Don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re doing this for her..&rdquo; Namjoon asserted before hanging up abruptly. </p><p>Jungkook let out an audible sigh and tossed his phone over onto the couch, not wanting to think at the moment. Was he really doing the right thing..? He questioned himself as he walked around the other side of the counter towards the fridge.&nbsp;</p><p>How was he going to explain to you? What would you say or do? Jungkook ran his hands through his hair once more trying to settle his nerves as he began to make breakfast for you two, deciding that would be the best time to break the news.. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4hfPcoL1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>You stirred around a few times, groaning as you slowly began to wake up. The light coming through the curtains was bright enough to cause you to rub at your eyes, shielding them from the sensitive rays.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Shit..&rdquo; You mumbled as you began to come to your senses. You pried your eyes open, taking in your surroundings and position when you realized what had just happened. You slept with Jungkook. </p><p>Your face instantly became a shade of deep red as you frantically searched the floor for your clothes, feeling vulnerable all alone in the sheets.</p><p>&nbsp;Sliding out of bed, placing your feet on the cold floor, you noticed just how sore your legs became as you walked over to the dresser. Noticing one of the drawers was slightly open, you decided you&rsquo;d just change from whatever was in there.</p><p>Pulling a plain white shirt over your head and changing into underwear, you decided you looked decent enough, considering it was still early morning and you weren&rsquo;t planning to go anywhere anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Only then, as you ran your hands through your hair in an attempt to smooth the frizzy hairs, you realized Jungkook wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be seen. </p><p>You furrowed your brows and quickly moved over to his side of the bed to see his phone was gone along with his sweatpants.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking maybe he just went to the bathroom, you began to make your way towards the door to the hallway, when the smell of eggs and bacon hit your nose. </p><p>Making your way down the hallway to the stairs, the aroma of the fresh food became stronger. Figuring it was Jungkook, you tried to quickly make your way down the stairs, but failed as your legs felt like jelly. Your face became another shade of light red as your mind kept wandering back to why and how your legs came to be in the state they are. </p><p>Once you made it down the stairs, you began to head to the kitchen where you came into view of his back facing you as he stood in front of the stove. You let a small smile form on your face, imagining all the mornings you two would share like this.. Making breakfast together, enjoying coffee and such.. Minus the pain in the legs.. </p><p>You slowly made your way over to him, trying your best to not make any noise and surprise him, but he was quicker than you. &ldquo;If you wanna sneak up on someone you&rsquo;ve got to be more quiet than that.&rdquo; He snickered as you wrapped your arms around his bare torso from behind. </p><p>&ldquo;I tried my best, it&rsquo;s not exactly easy to walk anymore, thanks to you..&rdquo; You giggled as you smacked his back.&nbsp;</p><p>Walking around to the other side of the counter, you pulled a chair out and watched as he finished up the eggs. Jungkook just smirked as he turned around, placing the last of the food he made onto the plates. </p><p>&ldquo;Well you asked for it..&rdquo; He chuckled as you hid your face in your hands as you sat at the table. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say it was a team effort..&rdquo; You mumbled as he came to join you at the table, setting down your plate in front of you. &ldquo;Whatever you sayyyy&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook trailed along as he sat down opposite of you. </p><p>You two both sat and enjoyed your food as you made small talk, until Jungkook cleared his throat catching your attention. &ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; You questioned as you looked up at him, placing your fork down.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;So.. I wanted to talk to you about something..&rdquo; Jungkook informed as he set down his utensils as well. You scanned his face for any clues but all you were met with was a serious, yet somewhat comforting stare. </p><p>&ldquo;Okay..? What..?&rdquo; You questioned, shifting your legs to lean over on the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Namjoon&hellip; &ldquo; He began, and you immediately frowned, fearing the worst.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;He wants you to train and join..&rdquo; Jungkook said placing his hands flat on the table. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; You immediately choked up. &ldquo;Look I know it&rsquo;s-&rdquo; &ldquo;No! No Jungkook I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; You quickly retaliated, standing from your chair. </p><p>&ldquo;Y/N babe listen to me, I will train you myself and i&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;re with me the whole time..&rdquo; Jungkook explained as he stood from his chair, walking over to comfort you.&nbsp;</p><p>You stood bewildered, staring at the floor empty. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that Jungkook.. I can&rsquo;t do this..&rdquo; Your heart began to race at even the mere thought of it. </p><p>&ldquo;Listen.. I know it&rsquo;s a lot to take in but I won&rsquo;t let anyone hurt you Y/N. This is for the best.. You have to trust me..&rdquo; Jungkook cupped your face in his hands, causing you to look up at him.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I want you to be safe and be able to protect yourself if anything happens to me..&rdquo; Jungkook carrassed your face, tucking a small strand of hair behind your ear. </p><p>&ldquo;Jungkook I can&rsquo;t.. I&rsquo;m not strong enough.. I can&rsquo;t do this.. I&rsquo;m not you.. I&rsquo;m not like you..&rdquo; Your eyes began to tear up. Jungkook&rsquo;s heart ached. &ldquo;Look.. I know it&rsquo;s scary.. But I&rsquo;ll be with you the whole time. I&rsquo;ll train you myself. It&rsquo;s all gonna be okay..&rdquo; Jungkook pressed a kiss to your forehead as he pulled you into his chest.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You have to trust me.. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this if it wasn&rsquo;t for the best.&rdquo; Jungkook softly whispered into your ear. You pressed your face further into Jungkook&rsquo;s chest, wiping your tears away with your free hand. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared..&rdquo; You admitted. &ldquo;I know. But I won&rsquo;t let anything happen to you. Okay..?&rdquo; Jungkook gripped your shoulders, pulling you back to view your face. &ldquo;Okay..&rdquo; You breathed out.&nbsp;</p><p>Jungkook let a small smile form as he pulled you back into him. <i>Okay&hellip; It&rsquo;s all gonna be okay.. He won&rsquo;t let anything happen..</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4iyuMBl1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p><i><b>-&nbsp; 2 weeks later &nbsp;&nbsp;- </b></i></p><p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; You yelled out as your back hit the mat once again. &ldquo;You keep dropping your shoulder too low Y/N.. You need to react faster than that..&rdquo; Jungkook explained as he landed on top of you, with your arm pulled back.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fucking trying Jungkook.. Maybe if this wasn&rsquo;t so rushed I could learn properly..&rdquo; You snapped back at him as you stood, brushing off your arms.&nbsp;</p><p>You had been thrown down on the mat a good 6 times in a row now, not understanding the mistake being made. Namjoon had called back last week informing Jungkook that we had 2 weeks left to train before they had to bring you into base. </p><p>\t&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s hard.. But this is the only way you&rsquo;ll get better.&rdquo; Jungkook explained as he walked over behind you. &ldquo;Look, you have your shoulder here by the time I&rsquo;m already within reach. It needs to be here, so you can reach my arm and then flip.&rdquo; Jungkook instructed as he placed his hands on your shoulder, turning your body.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Try it from that angle next time.&rdquo; Jungkook patted your back as he moved to stand in front of you. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Alright..&rdquo; You breathed out, rolling your shoulders back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo; You announced. Jungkook nodded, giving a countdown. &ldquo;Alright&hellip; 3..2..&rdquo; He breathed out as he then ran at you, pulling the same move as last time.&nbsp;</p><p>Remembering the tip Jungkook gave you, you moved your shoulder to the right instead, grabbing Jungkook&rsquo;s arm and twisting it to pull him around.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking you finally did it and had the upperhand, you began to ease into it, until Jungkook thrashed and turned his body, landing a strike to your jaw. Of course it didn&rsquo;t hurt really bad, but still enough to piss you off even more. </p><p>\t&ldquo;The hell was that?!&rdquo; You huffed, shoving him away from you. &ldquo;You let your guard down.&rdquo; He simply responded. &ldquo;Never let your guard down until the enemy is down or dead.&rdquo; He clarified. You just glared at him from your spot on the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Take 5 and then we&rsquo;ll start weapon combat instead.&rdquo; Jungkook explained as he walked over to the wall, grabbing his water bottle. You pushed yourself up off the floor and out of the room to the bathroom, letting the door slam behind you. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4k3R6vG1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>\tStanding in front of the mirror, you cupped some cold water from the sink and splashed it on your face. Letting the water droplets run off and fall back into the sink. Your face was red and sweaty in defeat.&nbsp;</p><p>Grabbing one of the small towels from the rack, you wiped at your face, wiping away the small hair strands that had stuck to your face in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Shit..&rdquo; You mumbled as you turned to see a small purple bruise forming on your jaw from where Jungkook struck you. You really wished at times like these you would&rsquo;ve just said no and stuck with it. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking back into the large practice room, you saw Jungkook leaned up against the wall, phone in hand, typing away. You just scoffed and proceeded to place your belongings back onto the floor and stand in the middle of the room. However, you noticed Jungkook pulled out a small cart with all sorts of pocket knives and sharp weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You done&hellip;?&rdquo; You sarcastically commented as he looked up from his phone before hitting the screen once more and pocketing it. &ldquo;Yeah, sorry.&rdquo; He dismissed as he wheeled the cart over towards you. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Pick one.&rdquo; He abruptly commented as the cart came to a stop. &ldquo;This again?&rdquo; You dreaded. Last time you failed miserably and left with all sorts of small cuts and lacerations.&nbsp;</p><p>Jungkook was ruthless during training but afterwards always seemed to make it up and baby you. You wondered why he even bothered to go so hard in the first place. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah. You need to get better. This is gonna be the majority of what you run into out there.&rdquo; Jungkook explained as he picked up a decent sized dagger. You scoffer once more, picking up a similar weapon before kicking the cart to the side. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s try the chokehold again.&rdquo; Jungkook announced. You immediately frowned. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Really..? Don&rsquo;t you think we did that enough? You know I suck Jungkook.&rdquo; You pulled down the collar of your shirt, revealing all sorts of small cuts along your collarbones and base of your neck.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we need to train and keep working on it Y/N&hellip;&rdquo; Jungkook whined and tossed his head back, having had this conversation plenty times before. &ldquo;Just follow my lead again..&rdquo; </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4knbPgK1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next 2 hours or so consisted of you getting your ass kicked once again. You stood opposite of Jungkook, waiting for him to charge at you, giving it one more try. &ldquo;Alright.. 3..2..&rdquo; He began yet again, running full speed once he hit 1.&nbsp;</p><p>You quickly tried to register the words he told you earlier, but it all slipped from your memory as he charged, aiming and successfully slicing down your upper arm. You let out a strong hiss and swung around at him before your yell startled him. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck this! I&rsquo;m done! I quit!&rdquo; You screamed out, dropping your weapon to the floor and kicking it away from you. &ldquo;Y/N&hellip;You-&ldquo; &ldquo;No! No Jungkook! I&rsquo;m done! I&rsquo;m not strong enough I can&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; You yelled out, throwing your hands in the air.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too weak..&rdquo; You mumbled as you quickly stormed off towards the door, causing Jungkook to grab at your non-injured forearm. &ldquo;Wait.. you&rsquo;re bleeding..&rdquo; &ldquo;So what..&rdquo; You quickly yanked your arm out of his reach and slammed the door as you left. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting up against a tree nearby, you finally let yourself collapse. Tears no longer brimming your eyes, but falling freely now. Small sniffles accompanying. Your arm stung like a bitch at the moment but you didn&rsquo;t care anymore. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this..&rdquo; You cried to yourself as you leaned your head against the base of the tree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too weak&hellip;&rdquo; You continued to weep as you wiped at your eyes and nose. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it all worth it anymore? Surely you couldn&rsquo;t do this. You weren&rsquo;t made for this life&hellip; but neither was Jungkook.. and you saw that. But he still manages and found a way to survive. You never gave him credit for it, but now that you experienced it first hand, he was so strong. Much stronger than you could ever and will ever be. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just missed the simpler times. Working at that shitty motel.. Your biggest worry being school and not dying at any given moment.. You missed your friends&hellip; Family&hellip; Minji.. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be completely honest, you tried to just erase it from your memories. You weren&rsquo;t strong enough, or at least not yet to face it and face reality.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality of her being dead, her body still laying there back at Taehyung&rsquo;s old base.. dying at the hands of him.. You thought surely it would&rsquo;ve been all fine.. Jungkook was there.. he promised to get you out, but that didn&rsquo;t mean anything for Minji you guessed. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still vividly remembered the look on her face when she first woke and saw you back at Taehyung&rsquo;s. You wished you were dead in that moment because it would&rsquo;ve been better than trying to explain the hell you&rsquo;ve gone through and now just involved her in. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, still to this moment you wished you would&rsquo;ve. You wished it was you who Taehyung killed. You wished it wouldn&rsquo;t have been you who made it out amongst all the chaos you faced inside those walls. You wished it wasn&rsquo;t you who Jaebum sacrificed himself for.&nbsp;</p><p>You wished it wasn&rsquo;t you who brought Jin face to face with death. You wished it wasn&rsquo;t you who cost a whole army their lives outside of Taehyung&rsquo;s base. You wished it wasn&rsquo;t you who Jungkook saved. <i>You wished it wasn&rsquo;t you who Jungkook met. </i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4ldk9rl1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You finally begun dragging yourself back inside when the sun had managed to make its way down. Wiping away the tears that lingered on your face and brushing off the dirt and grass. You headed back for the backdoor you left unlocked when you left earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Stepping back inside, you noticed Jungkook wasn&rsquo;t in the living room and decided he was probably still downstairs in the practice room or something. You didn&rsquo;t really care at the moment in all honesty. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trudging up the stairs, you made your way down the hall to the bathroom. Flipping the light switch on as you opened the door, you stepped in, closing the door behind you. Y</p><p>ou immediately walked over to the cabinet, pulling the small door open and taking out the first aid kit. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You set the small box down on the counter and reached for a small washcloth, running it under warm water and then wiping gently at your arm. You let out a small hiss as the cloth came into contact with your wound. You watched as the cloth slowly became a dark red as the blood left your skin. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grabbing a small amount of ointment and applying it over the cut, you grabbed a bandage and wrapped it around your arm, struggling to secure it at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>Letting out a grunt and gripping the end tightly, you finally pulled the bandage tight and secured it. You headed back towards the door, flipping off the light and heading to yours and Jungkook&rsquo;s shared room.</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning the knob with ease, you pushed the door open and let it close halfway behind you. You walked over and sat at the edge of the bed and began to untie your shoes.&nbsp;</p><p>Tossing them in the corner of the room, and then changing into some leggings and a shirt. You ran a hand through your hair and went and sat back at the edge of the bed. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanning around the room a few times, there was still no sign of Jungkook. It felt somewhat weird you had to admit not being with him 24/7, but you figured you could use the hour or 2 away from each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Glancing over at his side of the bed, you noticed he had a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on the nightstand. Figuring it couldn&rsquo;t do much harm to you anymore, you let your misery get the best of you and decided to have one.</p><p>&nbsp;Pulling the balcony door open, you grabbed the pack of cigarettes and lighter and stepped out. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the small object in between your two fingers, you guided it up to your mouth and took a long drag, before exhaling and blowing the white smoke back into the air.&nbsp;</p><p>It tasted like shit and left your mouth feeling dry, but there was something oddly comforting and therapeutic about it. You could see why Jungkook did it almost every night. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of which, as you went back to take another drag, you could hear footsteps approaching the bedroom followed by Jungkook calling out your name. &ldquo;Y/N..?&rdquo; He called out, as he slowly pushed the bedroom door open.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Y/N are you alright..?&rdquo; Jungkook asked as he neared the balcony, wondering what you were doing outside. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t til he got closer he saw what was going on. You turned, cigarette in hand, about to answer, but got cut off abruptly. &ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; Jungkook scolded as he quickly walked out onto the balcony, smacking the cigarette out of your hand.</p><p>&ldquo;What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?!&rdquo; He scolded as he snatched the pack and lighter from the small table beside you.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;What does it look like.. or should I say what <i>did</i> it look like..&rdquo; You huffed back, crossing your arms over your chest. &ldquo;These things aren&rsquo;t good for you. They&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo; Jungkook glared at you as he shoved the pack in his back pocket.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay dad&hellip;&rdquo; You snapped, turning your back to him. &ldquo;Why do you do it then huh? I&rsquo;m not a damn baby Jungkook. I can do whatever I want.&rdquo; You growl at him. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jungkook snapped, grabbing your wrist and twirling you around to face him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you? Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?&rdquo; Jungkook furrowed his brows as he clutched your wrist.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s wrong..&rdquo; You mumbled as you yanked your wrist free, walking back inside your room, Jungkook following hot on your trail.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;You already know I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this if I didn&rsquo;t think it was what&rsquo;s best for you Y/N. What&rsquo;s best for us.&rdquo; Jungkook pleaded as he grabbed your wrist once more, dragging you over to sit on the bed with him. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I love you Y/N. You know I do. I just want you to be strong. To be able to protect yourself if I&rsquo;m not there.&rdquo; You let your hair fall in front of your eyes, not daring to face him. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the thing Jungkook. I&rsquo;m not strong. You again of all people should know that.&rdquo; You mumbled the last part. </p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But you are strong.&rdquo; Jungkook immediately fires back, taking your face in his hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t see it, but you&rsquo;ve been through hell and back and you&rsquo;re still here. You&rsquo;re still my girl. And if I thought even for a second that this training and plan would be of no good or bring harm to you, you know I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it.&rdquo; Jungkook brushed his thumb against your cheek.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Just trust me Y/N please..&rdquo; He said placing his forehead against yours.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I..&rdquo; You began, but paused when the sound of car pulling up outside startled you both. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s - ..?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Y/N kill the lights.. now.&rdquo;</i></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85b4531d124c3a7f6a01257433f99fa2/tumblr_inline_pdo4mmQyRd1tqh8f1_540.jpg\" class=\"\"/></figure><p>(A/N: surprise! i finally updated lmfao sorry for the like 2 month hiatus again :&rsquo;) it was just a real rough time and i was too tired to do literally anything rip but school is coming back next week unfortunately so my upload schedule will probably still be all whack but ill try my best oof i hope you guys enjoy this chapter !!)</p>",
