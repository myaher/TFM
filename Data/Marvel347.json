        "body": "<p>Thanos bent over you, a\ndark, lusty grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed you under your\narmpits and lifted you. When you got high enough, your bare feet sought for\npurchase on the throne. You now stood a head above him.</p><p>You gave Thanos a one sided\ngrin. \u201cWell this is a nice change.\u201d</p><p>Thanos grinned at you, a\ngrowl escaping his throat. You could already feel him start to lift up the hem\nof your shirt. You raised your arms. Goosebumps flared up as the rest of your\nbody became bared to the coolness of the room.</p><p>\u201cHmmm. No bra today?\u201d</p><p>You gave a one shouldered\nshrug. \u201cI usually don\u2019t wear one to spend time in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I should go to\n<i>your </i>room more, little one.\u201d</p><p>Thanos ran his hands up\nyour sides, his thumbs coming to graze along the cusps of your breasts.</p><p>You tilted your head side\nto side. \u201cYour room? My room? I\u2019ll stop wearing one altogether if that\u2019s what\nyou want.\u201d</p><p>But in reality, you hoped\nhe didn\u2019t. Even though you had gotten used to the coldness of space, it helped\nwhen you had more padding over your breasts.</p><p>\u201cBut I know how you get\ncold, little one,\u201d the Mad Titan crooned as if reading your mind. He eyed your\nnakedness. \u201cI can see you\u2019re cold now.\u201d He took a step down. \u201cMaybe I should\nwarm you up.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to\nyour right breast and lapped at your nipple. His arms went around you, on to\nyour back, one to your ass. He gave it a nice gentle queeze, but his tongue he\npressed down harder to circle round and round your nipple. The heat in your\nbody started building again. You knew Thanos was rock hard by now and craving\nrelease. But in his mind, your body was like a temple. And you were his\ngoddess. You gripped his shoulders as he suckled on you. As much as you wanted\nto go for a second orgasm, you were dying to pleasure him. To hear him moan\nyour name.</p><p>\u201cThanos\u2026let me,\u201d you\ngasped as he gave a particularly hard suck. \u201cLet me touch you. I want to touch\nyou.\u201d</p><p>Thanos pulled back.\n\u201cOhhh\u2026little one\u2026you don\u2019t know what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>You gripped down harder on\nhis shoulders. \u201cPull out your dick for me and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Thanos removed his arms\nfrom around you. He stepped right up to the throne, his head now above yours.\nHis eyes never left yours as he released himself. You didn\u2019t even have to reach\ndown to touch him. Thanos\u2019s eyes narrowed, his lips parting slightly as you\nstroked the underside of his cock. It was smooth and veiny, just like any\nman\u2019s, but of course much larger so instead of closing your hand around it, you\nran your palm along it.<br/><br/>\n\u201cYou like that, Big Daddy?\u201d<br/><br/>\nYour voice was low. Seductive. Thanos moaned. You dropped into a crouch and\nleaned forward. You set your tongue upon his shaft and licked upwards, slowly.\nThanos\u2019s right hand instantly went to your hair as he let out a deep groan. You\nlicked him again, closer to the tip this time. Then you went to his head. There\nwas no way you could fit it all in his mouth, but you still sucked on it. His\ncock twitched and you couldn\u2019t help but grin. Here he was, the Mad Titan himself,\none of the most powerful beings in the universe, coming undone just by having\nyour tiny mouth sucking on his dick like a giant lollipop. His grip on your\nhair tightened.</p><p>\u201cOhhh\u2026so good. But\nnot\u2026enough. I must\u2026feel you around me.\u201d</p><p>Thanos jerked away from\nyou, leaving you with your mouth still gaping open. You let out a strangled cry\nas he grabbed you suddenly, hoisting you into the air. He spun you around and\nyou automatically fell forward, grabbing onto the back of the throne as you did\nso.</p><p>You felt Thanos\u2019s breath\non your ear. \u201cYou want to play queen and sit on a throne?\u201d He grabbed your hips\nand pulled you backwards, making you bend over. \u201cI\u2019ll give you something to sit\non.\u201d</p><p>You automatically clenched\nas you felt Thanos enter you. He inched his way in and your mouth fell into an\n\u2018o\u2019 shape. Although the two of you had had sex multiple times, the burn was\nstill there. Usually he gave you time to adjust to him, but not now. You let\nout a whimper as he stretched you further and further. Then finally he stopped.\nHis breathing was heavy, not from overexertion, but from being overcome from\nlust. From feeling your tightness around him.

Your eyes almost rolled into the back of your head.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d you moaned.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to help me\nbring balance to the universe?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed your breast.</p><p>\u201cYes I do. I want that.\nThanos, please, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Thanos chuckled. \u201cAsk and\nyou shall receive.\u201d</p><p>You cried out as Thanos\ngave his hardest thrust yet. You actually felt it reverberate through your\nstomach. He had gone hardcore on you before and each time, you thought you\u2019d be\nprepared for it. He thrusted again. And again. The muscles in your groin were\nbeginning to sting. Thanos thrusted faster and this time, your eyes did roll\nback. Flesh slapped against flesh as he pounded into you.</p><p>Every thrust made you cry\nout. Thanos grunted and groaned. Your knuckles were white as you held onto the\nback of the throne. You felt an intense heat start to build up. The friction.\nThe intense pounding of his head against your g-spot. It was too much. Every\nmuscle in your thighs and abdomen burned, but the pleasure inside you built up\nlike a volcano. You threw your head back as an intense orgasm hit you. Your\nwhole body locked in place and you almost literally saw stars. You cried out.</p><p>\u201cThanos! Aahhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2026are\u2026mine\u2026Y/N. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Thanos gave your breast\none final squeeze and you heard him give a strangled cry. He stilled for just a\nsecond before you felt it. There was a geyser inside you as Thanos came. You\ncollapsed in his arms and he had to catch you. He finally pulled out of you and\nlowered you onto the throne. Your hand landed in a big splotch of cum, but you\nwere way too tired to care.</p><p>You felt Thanos\u2019s hand in\nyour hair again. \u201cMine,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope you don\u2019t\nneed this throne back anytime soon,\u201d you said between deep breaths. \u201cBecause I\ndon\u2019t think I can move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to,\nlittle one.\u201d Thanos knelt.

                "content": "<p>Thanos bent over you, a\ndark, lusty grin on his face.</p><p>&ldquo;My turn.&rdquo;</p><p>He grabbed you under your\narmpits and lifted you. When you got high enough, your bare feet sought for\npurchase on the throne. You now stood a head above him.</p><p>You gave Thanos a one sided\ngrin. &ldquo;Well this is a nice change.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos grinned at you, a\ngrowl escaping his throat. You could already feel him start to lift up the hem\nof your shirt. You raised your arms. Goosebumps flared up as the rest of your\nbody became bared to the coolness of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmmm. No bra today?&rdquo;</p><p>You gave a one shouldered\nshrug. &ldquo;I usually don&rsquo;t wear one to spend time in my room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then maybe I should go to\n<i>your </i>room more, little one.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos ran his hands up\nyour sides, his thumbs coming to graze along the cusps of your breasts.</p><p>You tilted your head side\nto side. &ldquo;Your room? My room? I&rsquo;ll stop wearing one altogether if that&rsquo;s what\nyou want.&rdquo;</p><p>But in reality, you hoped\nhe didn&rsquo;t. Even though you had gotten used to the coldness of space, it helped\nwhen you had more padding over your breasts.</p><p>&ldquo;But I know how you get\ncold, little one,&rdquo; the Mad Titan crooned as if reading your mind. He eyed your\nnakedness. &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re cold now.&rdquo; He took a step down. &ldquo;Maybe I should\nwarm you up.&rdquo;</p><p>He lowered his head to\nyour right breast and lapped at your nipple. His arms went around you, on to\nyour back, one to your ass. He gave it a nice gentle queeze, but his tongue he\npressed down harder to circle round and round your nipple. The heat in your\nbody started building again. You knew Thanos was rock hard by now and craving\nrelease. But in his mind, your body was like a temple. And you were his\ngoddess. You gripped his shoulders as he suckled on you. As much as you wanted\nto go for a second orgasm, you were dying to pleasure him. To hear him moan\nyour name.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanos&hellip;let me,&rdquo; you\ngasped as he gave a particularly hard suck. &ldquo;Let me touch you. I want to touch\nyou.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos pulled back.\n&ldquo;Ohhh&hellip;little one&hellip;you don&rsquo;t know what you do to me.&rdquo;</p><p>You gripped down harder on\nhis shoulders. &ldquo;Pull out your dick for me and you&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos removed his arms\nfrom around you. He stepped right up to the throne, his head now above yours.\nHis eyes never left yours as he released himself. You didn&rsquo;t even have to reach\ndown to touch him. Thanos&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, his lips parting slightly as you\nstroked the underside of his cock. It was smooth and veiny, just like any\nman&rsquo;s, but of course much larger so instead of closing your hand around it, you\nran your palm along it.<br /><br />\n&ldquo;You like that, Big Daddy?&rdquo;<br /><br />\nYour voice was low. Seductive. Thanos moaned. You dropped into a crouch and\nleaned forward. You set your tongue upon his shaft and licked upwards, slowly.\nThanos&rsquo;s right hand instantly went to your hair as he let out a deep groan. You\nlicked him again, closer to the tip this time. Then you went to his head. There\nwas no way you could fit it all in his mouth, but you still sucked on it. His\ncock twitched and you couldn&rsquo;t help but grin. Here he was, the Mad Titan himself,\none of the most powerful beings in the universe, coming undone just by having\nyour tiny mouth sucking on his dick like a giant lollipop. His grip on your\nhair tightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Ohhh&hellip;so good. But\nnot&hellip;enough. I must&hellip;feel you around me.&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos jerked away from\nyou, leaving you with your mouth still gaping open. You let out a strangled cry\nas he grabbed you suddenly, hoisting you into the air. He spun you around and\nyou automatically fell forward, grabbing onto the back of the throne as you did\nso.</p><p>You felt Thanos&rsquo;s breath\non your ear. &ldquo;You want to play queen and sit on a throne?&rdquo; He grabbed your hips\nand pulled you backwards, making you bend over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you something to sit\non.&rdquo;</p><p>You automatically clenched\nas you felt Thanos enter you. He inched his way in and your mouth fell into an\n&lsquo;o&rsquo; shape. Although the two of you had had sex multiple times, the burn was\nstill there. Usually he gave you time to adjust to him, but not now. You let\nout a whimper as he stretched you further and further. Then finally he stopped.\nHis breathing was heavy, not from overexertion, but from being overcome from\nlust. From feeling your tightness around him. He slowly pulled backward and let\nout a moan as he did so. You let out a shaky breath. He slowly went back forward\nagain. You bit your bottom lip to stifle a cry of pleasure. Thanos&rsquo;s right hand\nwas in your hair again, his left on the arm of the throne. He bent over you.</p><p>&ldquo;So you want to live like\na queen, do you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;T-Thanos&hellip;I don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;</p><p>He roughly thrusted\nforward and you let out a cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me ask you again.&rdquo;</p><p>His grip on your hair\ntightened.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you&hellip;&rdquo; he pulled back,\n&ldquo;want to&hellip;&rdquo; Another thrust. Your legs started shaking. &ldquo;Live like a queen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. I want to be\nwith you. Please.&rdquo;</p><p>He brought his gauntleted\nhand up to fondle your breast. He slowly pushed further into you, as far as he\ncould go. Your legs started to weaken and you felt a light sheen of sweat start\nto cover you. Even your palms were sweating.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to bathe with\nme in the blood of my enemies?&rdquo;</p><p>Thanos moved his hips in a\ncircular motion. Your eyes almost rolled into the back of your head.</p><p>&ldquo;Yesss,&rdquo; you moaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to help me\nbring balance to the universe?&rdquo;</p><p>He squeezed your breast.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes I do.
