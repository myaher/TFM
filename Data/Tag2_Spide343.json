He left, leaving an empty space next to her. He left, with only a squeeze in her hand and a reassuring smile. A\u00a0smile that said\u00a0everything would be okay and the he would be back.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Aileen wasn&rsquo;t sure about that anymore.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He was gone for hours. And she made sure to stay with Aunt May, so they could emotionally support each other. So she could at least have a sense that Peter, <i>her</i>\u00a0\u00a0Peter, was still there with her. That he did not leave an emptiness inside her\u00a0when he jumped out of the window not saying anything if he was going to be back or not. Aileen was starting to think that maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t. And that thought brought tears in her eyes.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 They had started to date a few months before. Peter took his time to ask her out. After the fiasco with Liz, he didn&rsquo;t want to jump on another fantasy with some girl that he may not even have a future with. He wanted to make sure he was sure about the girl he went out with. Because he didn&rsquo;t want to get hurt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When Aileen showed up, it was too good to be true. She was perfect, in Peter&rsquo;s eyes. She was smart, funny and cute. Aileen was everything he had ever wanted in girl. She was friendly with everyone, even if they were mean to her, and she looked at Peter with the most soft brown eyes he had ever seen. Aileen was going to be Peter&rsquo;s doom.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He asked her out a year later. She said yes. Aileen was waiting for that the entire year she was at Midtown Tech. She loved spending time with Peter. And slowly, she fell in love with him. To her, Peter Parker was the dream boy. He was smart, the smartest person she had ever met, funny, he would make this jokes not intentionally and she would laugh until tears would get out of her eyes, and adorable. How did a guy like him existed?</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Aileen found out Peter was Spider Man\u00a0a few weeks into their friendship. It only made her fall in love with him more. Except, she didn&rsquo;t know it would be the doom of her.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It was only three hours later that Aileen decided to text Peter. She hoped where he was had cell signal.

Except, she didn&rsquo;t know it would be the doom of her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was only three hours later that Aileen decided to text Peter. She hoped where he was had cell signal. She hoped he was still alive to answer her.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Aileen</b>:&nbsp;Are you okay?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sighed, gazing at her phone. She hoped he was alive. She hoped she would get to say all the things she didn&rsquo;t get to say to him. She really wanted him to come back.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Aileen had no idea what time it was when he responded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She took her phone and immediately unlocked it. He was alive, and he had answered her text.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter</b>:&nbsp;Um, Karen, answer her that I&rsquo;m alive. That I will go back to her when this is over. Text her that I love her.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aileen read through the text hundred times. He was alive. And Karen, his A.I., clearly needed to learn how to text. But most, importantly, he loved her. She smiled, a couple of tears running on her cheeks. She texted rapidly to him.</p><p><b>Aileen</b>:&nbsp;I love you too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly got up of Peter&rsquo;s bed. She needed to tell May that he was alive.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Aileen wasn&rsquo;t sure how many times she checked her phone waiting for an answer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She had sent a couple of other texts to him. He had answered all of them. But the last one he hadn&rsquo;t answered yet.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Aileen</b>:&nbsp;Is it over yet? I miss you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She looked over and over again at her phone screen, waiting for his sign. Waiting for him to say that he would be coming back to her. To&nbsp;Aunt May. To Ned. But still nothing. Aileen started to question if he&nbsp;was realy coming back. If Karen had a protocol for this type of situation. If she would see him again. She really hoped she would.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>It was late in the afternoon when Aileen realized something was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ned and her were in Peter&rsquo;s room building the Lego Death Star for the hundreth time when she looked out of the window and saw something odd. A person had crumbled to dust entirely. She looked further down the street and saw other people suffering from the same fate. She hurriedly got to her phone, desperate to see if Peter was okay.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Peter</b>:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In that moment, she crumbled too.&nbsp;</p><p>It was morning of the next day when a ragged Tony Stark appeared in Aunt May&rsquo;s apartament.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He looked utterly devasted and lost. Aileen had never seen him like this. Granted, she had never seen him in person before. He couldn't&nbsp; look Aunt May in the eye. He&nbsp; had tear stains ain his cheek and, although his clothes were clean, Aileen could tell he hadn&rsquo;t had a shower yet. He opened his mouth and closed it before asking to come in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanos had wiped out half of the universe. Those standing in the room were &lsquo;lucky&rsquo; enough to not have become dust. That was what Tony Stark said to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aileen wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was lucky. She was sure of anything anymore. The only thing she was certain was Peter. And he was gone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Stark stayed little time. He offered help for May. If she needed anything, he told, she should call him. He looked at Aileen with sad eyes and offered her a smile. That was all he could offer her at the time.&nbsp;</p></p>",
