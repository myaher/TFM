        "body": "<h1>A Note About Phanfiction from a Phanfic Writer </h1><p>Hey guys. </p><p>So I know that a lot has been happening and there is a lot going on with a lot of mixed feelings and I thought that I\u2019d speak about my own phanfic writing. </p><p><!-- more --></p><p>When Dan\u2019s video came out, I never once thought to myself that I needed to stop writing phanfic. I never thought about that being the reason I stopped writing. But when I saw all of the posts circulating around, I began to feel really weird about my fic writing. </p><p>To put it bluntly, I felt kind of gross. </p><p>I was writing fic about two real life guys and I suddenly felt this awful feeling creeping up my spine of \u201choly fuck what have I done\u201d. </p><p>And these feelings stayed overnight into yesterday and it was really hard for me to not get the knee jerk reaction to pull the plug on all of my fics and run away as fast I could. </p><p>But then I spoke to my friends Claire and Alex and I voiced all of my concerns to them and I suddenly began to realize what I was telling them. </p><p>I wasn\u2019t writing Dan or Phil to be <i>Dan or Phil, </i>I was writing them as these two characters that just so happened to be in my narratives and my universes and that\u2019s how I want it to remain. </p><p>I\u2019m not going to write realistic / canon verses for Phanfiction. I\u2019m going to write alternative realities and universes that just so happen to have Dan and Phil as characters of a totally different story. </p><p>In this time, I\u2019m going to continue to write fic until Dan or Phil say otherwise.
