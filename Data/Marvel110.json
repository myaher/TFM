        "body": "<p>\n\n<b>Chapter 3: Prisoner Of War\n\n</b><br/></p><p><b>Summary:\u00a0\n\n</b>Reader is detained and taken to the CIA headquarters. She&rsquo;s believed she&rsquo;s been brought there to die, especially when Thor shows up carrying Storm Breaker.\n\n</p><p><b>Notes:\u00a0Continuing with my weird theme, Everybody Knows by Sigrid (The one used at the beginning of Justice League - you know, that dumpster fire of a movie? It was, fight me.) is a song I would listen to for this chapter. Especially when Reader is being shown her cell in DC.Also going to be second person from here on out. The last chapter almost was, but I decided to keep with the Spoils of War theme and have it from the view of the people on the ground.</b></p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language</b></p><!-- more --><p>You began to slowly come to, your head slightly throbbing from the sonic blast you had endured before your crash landing. You knew in a few hours it will have been like you weren&rsquo;t even in a fight. The bonus of your mutation, you were almost indestructible. Even if the collar was still on you&hellip;. </p><p>Pausing in your thought, you realized it felt like there was still a collar around your neck. But you were pretty damn sure you remembered seeing it on the ground in front of you at the end of the fight. You could feel your hands beneath your head and you slowly moved one to feel at your neck. Sure enough, the collar was back. Or was it? This one felt newer, sleaker, and cleaner for damn sure. What did happen when the fight ended? You remembered falling, seeing the collar, torching your handlers - gods that had felt good. But after that? It was kind of a blur. Almost as if your body had locked down against your will.</p><p>You moved to sit up and that&rsquo;s when you noticed you had large metal cuffs around your wrists. Attached to them was a long metal chain that met large metal cuffs at your ankles. Your wings twitched and you could hear the rattling of more chains. Clearly whomever had ended up with you wasn&rsquo;t fucking around.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for our safety.&rdquo; Came an authoritative voice.</p><p>Your head instantly snapped up to see you weren&rsquo;t alone. Sitting up, you could see you were in a metalic grey room with hexagon designs all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. You had been laying on your stomach on a very hard bed and as you sat up you almost fell over. Your tail had been bound with your wings and it was throwing off your center of balance.</p><p>In the room with you stood four men in each corner: to your right was the large, all metal mutant that had grabbed you by the tail during the fight. You knew if you stood up he would easily tower over you by a foot or two. To his right was the man who shot you in the back. He looked like a soldier, greying hair but a hard face and had a metal arm like the Winter Soldier. But you could see the metal peeking out of his collar of his shirt onto his neck and you could swear it almost looked organic. Like it had grown from his skin. Next to him was a man you had only seen glimpses of during the battle. He was good looking in a rugged sort of way, full beard, built, and a look about him like he had seen too much in his life. These three would not make for easy jailers while you had the collar on.</p><p>And the last man seemed out of place from the other three. He was in slacks and a button up with the sleeves rolled up and a bullet proof vest over that. There was a bureaucratic manner about him and it seemed odd he was one of your jailers.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re finally awake,&rdquo; the suit spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Phil Coulson, Director of SHIELD. This is Logan, Cable, and Colossus of the X-Men. We&rsquo;ll be guarding you as we travel to DC. You&rsquo;ll be staying at the CIA headquarters there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, a director of SHIELD. That explains why he was there. And if SHIELD finally caught you, that could only mean one thing: what Hydra said was correct. You were captured and now you would be killed because of how dangerous you were. Gods only knew why you were being taken to DC first instead of having the job finished at the compound you had been held at. You knew better than to believe the lie that you would be &lsquo;staying&rsquo; in DC. Hydra may have lied to you about a lot of things, but if SHIELD was finally getting involved in your life, you knew everything you had been told about them was going to lead to your end.</p><p>Sighing, you tried to find a comfortable position on the bed. But it was always a bitch trying to sit with your over-sized wings on a normal basis. Throw in them and your tail being tied up against your body and you could kiss any form of comfort goodbye. In the end, you gave up and opted to stand against the wall in between Cable and Colossus.</p><p>&ldquo;Bed not to your liking?&rdquo; You just twitched your wings in response. &ldquo;The chains will come off once we get you in your cell in DC. Then we can talk about where we go from there. Sergeant Barnes told us your name is ______?&rdquo;</p><p>You frowned in confusion. Sergeant Barnes? You were unfamiliar with that name, though Coulson was told your name correctly.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry, guess you would have known him as the Winter Soldier.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes grew wide. The Winter Soldier was alive?! After he disappeared, your handlers had informed you SHIELD had killed him and that you would end up the same if you ever tried to escape. So what was the truth?</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming Hydra must have told you some story after he escaped their clutches.&rdquo; You remained silent. &ldquo;You know, this would go a lot easier and faster if you joined the conversation.&rdquo;</p><p>Silence continued from your spot on the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess Barnes was correct on that assessment. Anyway, he&rsquo;s an old friend of Captain America and Cap helped Barnes get deprogrammed so he could rejoin society. If you play your cards right, the same can happen for you.&rdquo;</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes. Sure, deprogrammed and join a society that clearly hates anything that&rsquo;s even remotely different. And maybe your wings will turn in to cute, glittery pixie wings that fold up easily against your body.</p><p>&ldquo;_____, I promise we just want to help you. But you need to meet us halfway. Can you tell us how long you&rsquo;ve been at that facility? How long Hydra had you? Do you have any idea where your family might be? We can call them if you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes narrowed at the mention of the people who tossed you into the cold, cruel world alone just because you began to sprout wings and a tail against your will. Leaving your vulnerable for Hydra to just come along and pluck you off the ground. If you ever saw them again, it would be too soon.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing she doesn&rsquo;t care about them, which is unsurprising,&rdquo; Logan spoke up and Coulson looked over his shoulder at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not uncommon for mutants to get tossed out by their parents once their powers come to the surface. With the ones that _____ has, I&rsquo;m even less surprised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Da, Logan is correct. Our school is full of many students who no longer have a home of their own. If _____ can shake off Hydra&rsquo;s hold, it could become her home as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Coulson looked back at you. &ldquo;Is that true? Did your parents throw you out?&rdquo;</p><p>Your eyes began to water and you blinked your eyes as you averted your gaze. The last thing you wanted to think about was the day you lost your home. Anger bubbled inside you: what gave them the right to ask about your personal business? In frustration, you pulled a foot up and kicked behind you to hit the wall. The loud bang reverberated around the room.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing you hit a touchy subject. Better back off before she figures out a way to torch our asses even with that collar on,&rdquo; Cable quipped.</p><p>Coulson nodded his head. &ldquo;My apologies. We can talk about that later.&rdquo;</p><p>Or never, you thought. Never would be good.</p><p>Before long the plane began it&rsquo;s descent into DC and you could hear a commotion outside the door. Coulson poked his head out, spoke a few words, and soon a woman was walking in.</p><p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, _____. My name is Melinda May and I&rsquo;m Coulson&rsquo;s second in command. How are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow and looked at her as if to say Are you fucking kidding me? but remained silent otherwise. Coulson just sighed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been silent this whole flight. Not even a word of this 'dragon&rsquo;s tongue&rsquo; Barnes mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>That caught you off guard. They knew what language you mainly spoke but not how to speak it. You had to admit it was going to be nice to not have to speak every time someone asked you a question.</p><p>May just nodded and opened the door wider. &ldquo;Ross is waiting for us inside.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Secretary or Agent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agent. The Secretary of State will arrive later tonight or first thing in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Coulson looked over at Colossus and Cable. They each grabbed an arm and began to pull you through the doorway after Coulson and May, Logan bringing up the rear. You didn&rsquo;t bother trying to fight. With the collar and chains on you, even if you could fight off the five surrounding you there was no chance you would make it off the plane before being brought down. The five of you walked out of the room and out the back of the plane, passing by groups of people you saw on the battlefield. None of them seemed to be holding a grudge against you. Well, except the one you were assuming was Captain America. He was watching you with a measured gaze, the shield he tossed at you strapped to his back. You walked across the expansive landing strip and into an obvious government building. There a group of people was waiting to greet you, only one you recognized thanks to Hydra but you were sure they all were Avengers.</p><p>Tony Stark strolled up to you despite Coulson voicing his concerns. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Phil. She&rsquo;s not going anywhere. Hey, kid. I&rsquo;m Tony Stark. Those are some pretty awesome wings. Mind if I take a look?&rdquo;</p><p>You jerked back the best you could when he slowly reached out to touch you.</p><p>He pulled his hands back and held them up in surrender. &ldquo;Fair enough, I should have waited for the O.K. Look, the plan is to keep you here for a while to make sure you&rsquo;re not a threat, see what you know about Hydra, the whole 9 yards. But we&rsquo;re hoping maybe you&rsquo;d want to join our team when your time is up? Could really use someone like you.&rdquo;</p><p>Join the Avengers? Had he lost his ever loving mind? Clearly he was trying to trick you, but you couldn&rsquo;t help but be compelled to answer him.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Zaldr\u012bzes buzdari iksos daor</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Everyone froze and turned to stare at you. The silence was so painful and so focused on you, no one noticed the small group of agents walking over. The head of the group was a man with greying hair and dark blue eyes. He had a serious look to him and you knew he would be the one in charge of your 'stay&rsquo; in this building.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a problem here, Stark?&rdquo;</p><p>That seemed to snap everyone out of their trance. &ldquo;Agent Ross, you&rsquo;re just in time. Our guest actually spoke! Though Barnes was right. I have no idea what the hell language that was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s tongue, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Appears to be so. But I just got word that Thor returned to the compound an hour ago. He should be flying over here any minute and maybe he&rsquo;ll have an idea what she&rsquo;s saying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. In the meantime let&rsquo;s get her set up.&rdquo;</p><p>Colossus and Cable pulled you forward to follow after the group of agents, the Avengers now behind you. Except for Stark. Now that he knew you could and would speak, he was glued to your side.</p><p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the deal, kid? Barnes said you know over thirty different languages but you choose the one that no one else knows now that your handlers are dead? Don&rsquo;t you miss talking to someone?&rdquo; You looked over at him and frowned and raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Ok, fair. I&rsquo;m sure Hydra agents were just a barrel of laughs. But don&rsquo;t count us out! We got a great facility and you could start your life over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give promises you can&rsquo;t keep, Stark.&rdquo; Agent Ross warned. &ldquo;We heard what happened on the battlefield and I can&rsquo;t see Secretary Ross just handing her over to you guys. Especially given your track record.&rdquo;</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and blew a raspberry. &ldquo;Details.&rdquo;</p><p>Your group eventually stopped in front of an all glass room and there, one more person was waiting. &ldquo;Good evening, ______. I&rsquo;m Professor Charles Xavier. I&rsquo;m a mutant, just like you.&rdquo;</p><p>Like you? Cocking an eyebrow, you twitched your wings so the chains rattled. The professor chuckled.</p><p>&ldquo;You are correct, I do not have wings. My mutation has to do with my mind and for that I must apologize. I am the one who froze you at the end of the fight.&rdquo;</p><p>Sighing, you nodded your head in acknowledgement. That would explain why you didn&rsquo;t remember much after you torched Hydra.</p><p>\u201cI will be visiting you often in hopes you will open up and talk about what you had experienced. Now as a fair warning, I can read minds though I try not too without permission.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head again and waited as the agents heaved open the heavy door to your cell. Colossus and Cable pulled you inside and then turned you to face the entrance. Coulson came up holding a set if keys.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, _____. But we\u2019ll need to freeze you again.\u201d</p><p>This time you were kept conscious and it felt&hellip;. wrong. It was like you had been pushed to the back of your own mind, losing all control.</p><p>The three men went to work removing your chains and cuffs, but leaving the collar on. Coulson gestured to the bed along one of the walls.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed is a set of clothes for you and in the corner a bathroom you can use to change in. Please place your old clothes in the sliding bin by the door. That bin will also be how you receive your food everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 of you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Stark.\u201d Agent Ross glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you guys are equipped for this any better than we are.\u201d</p><p>The three men left your cell and as the heavy door slammed home, the hold on you was released. Walking to the center of the room, you stretched your wings out first completely behind you and then fully to the sides. Your tail swished around you a few times as you walked to the bed. On the bed you could see a small pile of clothes and already you were filled with dread. No way in hell any of this would fit you and clearly they didn\u2019t trust you enough to make your own. Though in all fairness it did take at least five years and many ripped bed sheets later before Hydra finally gave in. You wondered how long it would take SHIELD.</p><p>You picked up the shirt first and frowned. It was a standard shirt which meant no way in hell would you be able to get it on with your wings still attached. At your old compound you had a small variety of strapless corsets, halter tops, and even one long sleeve shirt that you had sewn a zipper into the back and a scooped back to accommodate where your wings were located right on each side of your shoulder blades. Without another look, you tossed the shirt on the floor close to the sliding tray.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, that\u2019s standard issue. You have to wear it.\u201d</p><p>You just cocked an eyebrow at the agent and flexed your wings. Then you picked up the pants. A fine length but you could see the seem in the back wasn\u2019t meant to be pulled apart. Which meant when you did to make room for your tail, nothing would stop the pants from splitting completely. They got tossed aside as well.</p><p>Picking up the top sheet on the bed, you held the shorted side and quickly pulled with both hands. The sheet ripped perfectly down the middle thanks to all your years of practice.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Came the annoyed voice again.</p><p>You ignored him and removed your boots as requested, tossing them next to the discarding outfit. Picking up half of the bed sheet, you walked to the bathroom to change.</p><p>Well, you tried to at least. First the tops of your wings wouldn\u2019t go through the door. So you bent forward to ease them in first. But then your sides stuck out too much. Fucking hell. If the Winter Soldier told them about you why the fuck was the door too goddamn small?!</p><p>Sighing, you placed yourself in the doorway facing the bathroom and extended your wings out to offer you some cover. They would see your bare back but after the day you had, you were out of fucks to give.</p><p>Quickly you removed your old shirt and tossed it over your shoulder. There was a brief embarrassing murmur from the agents on the otherside of the glass followed by a laugh from Tony.</p><p>\u201cGuess you guys didn\u2019t plan very well. How the hell is she supposed to use the bathroom if she can\u2019t fit through the door?\u201d</p><p>You could hear Agent Ross clear his throat. \u201cUm, someone get maintenance up here on the double. We need to replace the door ASAP.\u201d</p><p>While you listened to the agents scramble, you took the sheet and began to wrap it around your torso to form a halter top, tying the two end pieces behind your back. You finally turned to face what was left of the group. Coulson and Ross were red in the face while Tony was shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNot laughing at you, kid. Just amazed the government would be this ill prepared.\u201d</p><p>You took the time to do a circle in place to get an idea for your cell. It was a decent size, giving you just enough room to expand your wings if necessary. The bathroom looked big enough but it was hard to know for sure since you couldn\u2019t fit in the door. The single size bed was bolted to one wall and when you looked up, the ceiling expanded at least twenty feet above. Fat lot of good it did, though. With this collar around your neck, it was like they just took a chain and bolted you to the ground. No super strength, so no ability to use your wings.</p><p>Better than Hydra, my ass.

You knew in a few hours it will have been like you weren\u2019t even in a fight. The bonus of your mutation, you were almost indestructible. Even if the collar was still on you\u2026. </p><p>Pausing in your thought, you realized it felt like there was still a collar around your neck. But you were pretty damn sure you remembered seeing it on the ground in front of you at the end of the fight. You could feel your hands beneath your head and you slowly moved one to feel at your neck. Sure enough, the collar was back. Or was it? This one felt newer, sleaker, and cleaner for damn sure. What did happen when the fight ended? You remembered falling, seeing the collar, torching your handlers - gods that had felt good. But after that? It was kind of a blur. Almost as if your body had locked down against your will.</p><p>You moved to sit up and that\u2019s when you noticed you had large metal cuffs around your wrists. Attached to them was a long metal chain that met large metal cuffs at your ankles. Your wings twitched and you could hear the rattling of more chains. Clearly whomever had ended up with you wasn\u2019t fucking around.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for our safety.\u201d Came an authoritative voice.</p><p>Your head instantly snapped up to see you weren\u2019t alone. Sitting up, you could see you were in a metalic grey room with hexagon designs all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. You had been laying on your stomach on a very hard bed and as you sat up you almost fell over. Your tail had been bound with your wings and it was throwing off your center of balance.</p><p>In the room with you stood four men in each corner: to your right was the large, all metal mutant that had grabbed you by the tail during the fight. You knew if you stood up he would easily tower over you by a foot or two. To his right was the man who shot you in the back. He looked like a soldier, greying hair but a hard face and had a metal arm like the Winter Soldier. But you could see the metal peeking out of his collar of his shirt onto his neck and you could swear it almost looked organic. Like it had grown from his skin. Next to him was a man you had only seen glimpses of during the battle. He was good looking in a rugged sort of way, full beard, built, and a look about him like he had seen too much in his life. These three would not make for easy jailers while you had the collar on.</p><p>And the last man seemed out of place from the other three. He was in slacks and a button up with the sleeves rolled up and a bullet proof vest over that. There was a bureaucratic manner about him and it seemed odd he was one of your jailers.</p><p>\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re finally awake,\u201d the suit spoke up. \u201cI\u2019m Phil Coulson, Director of SHIELD. This is Logan, Cable, and Colossus of the X-Men. We\u2019ll be guarding you as we travel to DC. You\u2019ll be staying at the CIA headquarters there.\u201d</p><p>Ah, a director of SHIELD. That explains why he was there. And if SHIELD finally caught you, that could only mean one thing: what Hydra said was correct. You were captured and now you would be killed because of how dangerous you were. Gods only knew why you were being taken to DC first instead of having the job finished at the compound you had been held at. You knew better than to believe the lie that you would be \u2018staying\u2019 in DC. Hydra may have lied to you about a lot of things, but if SHIELD was finally getting involved in your life, you knew everything you had been told about them was going to lead to your end.</p><p>Sighing, you tried to find a comfortable position on the bed. But it was always a bitch trying to sit with your over-sized wings on a normal basis. Throw in them and your tail being tied up against your body and you could kiss any form of comfort goodbye. In the end, you gave up and opted to stand against the wall in between Cable and Colossus.</p><p>\u201cBed not to your liking?\u201d You just twitched your wings in response. \u201cThe chains will come off once we get you in your cell in DC. Then we can talk about where we go from there. Sergeant Barnes told us your name is ______?\u201d</p><p>You frowned in confusion. Sergeant Barnes? You were unfamiliar with that name, though Coulson was told your name correctly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guess you would have known him as the Winter Soldier.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes grew wide. The Winter Soldier was alive?! After he disappeared, your handlers had informed you SHIELD had killed him and that you would end up the same if you ever tried to escape. So what was the truth?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming Hydra must have told you some story after he escaped their clutches.\u201d You remained silent. \u201cYou know, this would go a lot easier and faster if you joined the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Silence continued from your spot on the wall.</p><p>\u201cGuess Barnes was correct on that assessment. Anyway, he\u2019s an old friend of Captain America and Cap helped Barnes get deprogrammed so he could rejoin society. If you play your cards right, the same can happen for you.\u201d</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes. Sure, deprogrammed and join a society that clearly hates anything that\u2019s even remotely different. And maybe your wings will turn in to cute, glittery pixie wings that fold up easily against your body.</p><p>\u201c_____, I promise we just want to help you. But you need to meet us halfway. Can you tell us how long you\u2019ve been at that facility? How long Hydra had you? Do you have any idea where your family might be? We can call them if you want.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes narrowed at the mention of the people who tossed you into the cold, cruel world alone just because you began to sprout wings and a tail against your will. Leaving your vulnerable for Hydra to just come along and pluck you off the ground. If you ever saw them again, it would be too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t care about them, which is unsurprising,\u201d Logan spoke up and Coulson looked over his shoulder at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for mutants to get tossed out by their parents once their powers come to the surface. With the ones that _____ has, I\u2019m even less surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, Logan is correct. Our school is full of many students who no longer have a home of their own. If _____ can shake off Hydra\u2019s hold, it could become her home as well.\u201d</p><p>Coulson looked back at you. \u201cIs that true? Did your parents throw you out?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes began to water and you blinked your eyes as you averted your gaze. The last thing you wanted to think about was the day you lost your home. Anger bubbled inside you: what gave them the right to ask about your personal business? In frustration, you pulled a foot up and kicked behind you to hit the wall. The loud bang reverberated around the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you hit a touchy subject. Better back off before she figures out a way to torch our asses even with that collar on,\u201d Cable quipped.</p><p>Coulson nodded his head. \u201cMy apologies. We can talk about that later.\u201d</p><p>Or never, you thought. Never would be good.</p><p>Before long the plane began it\u2019s descent into DC and you could hear a commotion outside the door. Coulson poked his head out, spoke a few words, and soon a woman was walking in.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, _____. My name is Melinda May and I\u2019m Coulson\u2019s second in command. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow and looked at her as if to say Are you fucking kidding me? but remained silent otherwise. Coulson just sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s been silent this whole flight. Not even a word of this 'dragon\u2019s tongue\u2019 Barnes mentioned.\u201d</p><p>That caught you off guard. They knew what language you mainly spoke but not how to speak it. You had to admit it was going to be nice to not have to speak every time someone asked you a question.</p><p>May just nodded and opened the door wider. \u201cRoss is waiting for us inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecretary or Agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent. The Secretary of State will arrive later tonight or first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Coulson looked over at Colossus and Cable. They each grabbed an arm and began to pull you through the doorway after Coulson and May, Logan bringing up the rear. You didn\u2019t bother trying to fight. With the collar and chains on you, even if you could fight off the five surrounding you there was no chance you would make it off the plane before being brought down. The five of you walked out of the room and out the back of the plane, passing by groups of people you saw on the battlefield. None of them seemed to be holding a grudge against you. Well, except the one you were assuming was Captain America. He was watching you with a measured gaze, the shield he tossed at you strapped to his back. You walked across the expansive landing strip and into an obvious government building. There a group of people was waiting to greet you, only one you recognized thanks to Hydra but you were sure they all were Avengers.</p><p>Tony Stark strolled up to you despite Coulson voicing his concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Phil. She\u2019s not going anywhere. Hey, kid. I\u2019m Tony Stark. Those are some pretty awesome wings. Mind if I take a look?\u201d</p><p>You jerked back the best you could when he slowly reached out to touch you.</p><p>He pulled his hands back and held them up in surrender. \u201cFair enough, I should have waited for the O.K. Look, the plan is to keep you here for a while to make sure you\u2019re not a threat, see what you know about Hydra, the whole 9 yards. But we\u2019re hoping maybe you\u2019d want to join our team when your time is up? Could really use someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Join the Avengers? Had he lost his ever loving mind? Clearly he was trying to trick you, but you couldn\u2019t help but be compelled to answer him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Zaldr\u012bzes buzdari iksos daor</i>.\u201d</p><p>Everyone froze and turned to stare at you. The silence was so painful and so focused on you, no one noticed the small group of agents walking over. The head of the group was a man with greying hair and dark blue eyes. He had a serious look to him and you knew he would be the one in charge of your 'stay\u2019 in this building.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here, Stark?\u201d</p><p>That seemed to snap everyone out of their trance. \u201cAgent Ross, you\u2019re just in time. Our guest actually spoke! Though Barnes was right. I have no idea what the hell language that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragon\u2019s tongue, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears to be so. But I just got word that Thor returned to the compound an hour ago. He should be flying over here any minute and maybe he\u2019ll have an idea what she\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. In the meantime let\u2019s get her set up.\u201d</p><p>Colossus and Cable pulled you forward to follow after the group of agents, the Avengers now behind you. Except for Stark. Now that he knew you could and would speak, he was glued to your side.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal, kid? Barnes said you know over thirty different languages but you choose the one that no one else knows now that your handlers are dead? Don\u2019t you miss talking to someone?\u201d You looked over at him and frowned and raised an eyebrow. \u201cOk, fair. I\u2019m sure Hydra agents were just a barrel of laughs. But don\u2019t count us out! We got a great facility and you could start your life over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give promises you can\u2019t keep, Stark.\u201d Agent Ross warned. \u201cWe heard what happened on the battlefield and I can\u2019t see Secretary Ross just handing her over to you guys. Especially given your track record.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and blew a raspberry. \u201cDetails.\u201d</p><p>Your group eventually stopped in front of an all glass room and there, one more person was waiting. \u201cGood evening, ______. I\u2019m Professor Charles Xavier. I\u2019m a mutant, just like you.\u201d</p><p>Like you? Cocking an eyebrow, you twitched your wings so the chains rattled. The professor chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct, I do not have wings. My mutation has to do with my mind and for that I must apologize. I am the one who froze you at the end of the fight.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, you nodded your head in acknowledgement. That would explain why you didn\u2019t remember much after you torched Hydra.</p><p>\u201cI will be visiting you often in hopes you will open up and talk about what you had experienced. Now as a fair warning, I can read minds though I try not too without permission.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head again and waited as the agents heaved open the heavy door to your cell. Colossus and Cable pulled you inside and then turned you to face the entrance. Coulson came up holding a set if keys.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, _____. But we\u2019ll need to freeze you again.\u201d</p><p>This time you were kept conscious and it felt\u2026. wrong. It was like you had been pushed to the back of your own mind, losing all control.</p><p>The three men went to work removing your chains and cuffs, but leaving the collar on. Coulson gestured to the bed along one of the walls.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed is a set of clothes for you and in the corner a bathroom you can use to change in. Please place your old clothes in the sliding bin by the door. That bin will also be how you receive your food everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 of you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Stark.\u201d Agent Ross glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you guys are equipped for this any better than we are.\u201d</p><p>The three men left your cell and as the heavy door slammed home, the hold on you was released. Walking to the center of the room, you stretched your wings out first completely behind you and then fully to the sides. Your tail swished around you a few times as you walked to the bed. On the bed you could see a small pile of clothes and already you were filled with dread. No way in hell any of this would fit you and clearly they didn\u2019t trust you enough to make your own. Though in all fairness it did take at least five years and many ripped bed sheets later before Hydra finally gave in. You wondered how long it would take SHIELD.</p><p>You picked up the shirt first and frowned. It was a standard shirt which meant no way in hell would you be able to get it on with your wings still attached. At your old compound you had a small variety of strapless corsets, halter tops, and even one long sleeve shirt that you had sewn a zipper into the back and a scooped back to accommodate where your wings were located right on each side of your shoulder blades. Without another look, you tossed the shirt on the floor close to the sliding tray.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, that\u2019s standard issue. You have to wear it.\u201d</p><p>You just cocked an eyebrow at the agent and flexed your wings. Then you picked up the pants. A fine length but you could see the seem in the back wasn\u2019t meant to be pulled apart. Which meant when you did to make room for your tail, nothing would stop the pants from splitting completely. They got tossed aside as well.</p><p>Picking up the top sheet on the bed, you held the shorted side and quickly pulled with both hands. The sheet ripped perfectly down the middle thanks to all your years of practice.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Came the annoyed voice again.</p><p>You ignored him and removed your boots as requested, tossing them next to the discarding outfit. Picking up half of the bed sheet, you walked to the bathroom to change.</p><p>Well, you tried to at least. First the tops of your wings wouldn\u2019t go through the door. So you bent forward to ease them in first. But then your sides stuck out too much. Fucking hell. If the Winter Soldier told them about you why the fuck was the door too goddamn small?!</p><p>Sighing, you placed yourself in the doorway facing the bathroom and extended your wings out to offer you some cover. They would see your bare back but after the day you had, you were out of fucks to give.</p><p>Quickly you removed your old shirt and tossed it over your shoulder. There was a brief embarrassing murmur from the agents on the otherside of the glass followed by a laugh from Tony.</p><p>\u201cGuess you guys didn\u2019t plan very well. How the hell is she supposed to use the bathroom if she can\u2019t fit through the door?\u201d</p><p>You could hear Agent Ross clear his throat. \u201cUm, someone get maintenance up here on the double. We need to replace the door ASAP.\u201d</p><p>While you listened to the agents scramble, you took the sheet and began to wrap it around your torso to form a halter top, tying the two end pieces behind your back. You finally turned to face what was left of the group. Coulson and Ross were red in the face while Tony was shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNot laughing at you, kid. Just amazed the government would be this ill prepared.\u201d</p><p>You took the time to do a circle in place to get an idea for your cell. It was a decent size, giving you just enough room to expand your wings if necessary. The bathroom looked big enough but it was hard to know for sure since you couldn\u2019t fit in the door. The single size bed was bolted to one wall and when you looked up, the ceiling expanded at least twenty feet above. Fat lot of good it did, though. With this collar around your neck, it was like they just took a chain and bolted you to the ground. No super strength, so no ability to use your wings.</p><p>Better than Hydra, my ass. You thought bitterly.</p><p>You completed your circle to face the door again just as a door loudly banged opened. Tony looked over and smiled. \u201cThere you are, Point Break! Come see what we caught.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity got the better of you and you walked over to the glass wall. Into your vision walked a very tall, blonde, bearded man clad in leather armor. His hair was cut short and he had two different eye colors. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how good looking he was. But all that disappeared in the moment you noticed he was carrying an ax almost as tall as him.</p><p>You were right: SHIELD was going to kill you.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182640137018/a-dragon-is-not-a-slave\">Chapter 4</a></p>",

That explains why he was there. And if SHIELD finally caught you, that could only mean one thing: what Hydra said was correct. You were captured and now you would be killed because of how dangerous you were. Gods only knew why you were being taken to DC first instead of having the job finished at the compound you had been held at. You knew better than to believe the lie that you would be \u2018staying\u2019 in DC. Hydra may have lied to you about a lot of things, but if SHIELD was finally getting involved in your life, you knew everything you had been told about them was going to lead to your end.</p><p>Sighing, you tried to find a comfortable position on the bed. But it was always a bitch trying to sit with your over-sized wings on a normal basis. Throw in them and your tail being tied up against your body and you could kiss any form of comfort goodbye. In the end, you gave up and opted to stand against the wall in between Cable and Colossus.</p><p>\u201cBed not to your liking?\u201d You just twitched your wings in response. \u201cThe chains will come off once we get you in your cell in DC. Then we can talk about where we go from there. Sergeant Barnes told us your name is ______?\u201d</p><p>You frowned in confusion. Sergeant Barnes? You were unfamiliar with that name, though Coulson was told your name correctly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guess you would have known him as the Winter Soldier.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes grew wide. The Winter Soldier was alive?! After he disappeared, your handlers had informed you SHIELD had killed him and that you would end up the same if you ever tried to escape. So what was the truth?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming Hydra must have told you some story after he escaped their clutches.\u201d You remained silent. \u201cYou know, this would go a lot easier and faster if you joined the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Silence continued from your spot on the wall.</p><p>\u201cGuess Barnes was correct on that assessment. Anyway, he\u2019s an old friend of Captain America and Cap helped Barnes get deprogrammed so he could rejoin society. If you play your cards right, the same can happen for you.\u201d</p><p>You snorted and rolled your eyes. Sure, deprogrammed and join a society that clearly hates anything that\u2019s even remotely different. And maybe your wings will turn in to cute, glittery pixie wings that fold up easily against your body.</p><p>\u201c_____, I promise we just want to help you. But you need to meet us halfway. Can you tell us how long you\u2019ve been at that facility? How long Hydra had you? Do you have any idea where your family might be? We can call them if you want.\u201d</p><p>Your eyes narrowed at the mention of the people who tossed you into the cold, cruel world alone just because you began to sprout wings and a tail against your will. Leaving your vulnerable for Hydra to just come along and pluck you off the ground. If you ever saw them again, it would be too soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t care about them, which is unsurprising,\u201d Logan spoke up and Coulson looked over his shoulder at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for mutants to get tossed out by their parents once their powers come to the surface. With the ones that _____ has, I\u2019m even less surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, Logan is correct. Our school is full of many students who no longer have a home of their own. If _____ can shake off Hydra\u2019s hold, it could become her home as well.\u201d</p><p>Coulson looked back at you. \u201cIs that true? Did your parents throw you out?\u201d</p><p>Your eyes began to water and you blinked your eyes as you averted your gaze. The last thing you wanted to think about was the day you lost your home. Anger bubbled inside you: what gave them the right to ask about your personal business? In frustration, you pulled a foot up and kicked behind you to hit the wall. The loud bang reverberated around the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you hit a touchy subject. Better back off before she figures out a way to torch our asses even with that collar on,\u201d Cable quipped.</p><p>Coulson nodded his head. \u201cMy apologies. We can talk about that later.\u201d</p><p>Or never, you thought. Never would be good.</p><p>Before long the plane began it\u2019s descent into DC and you could hear a commotion outside the door. Coulson poked his head out, spoke a few words, and soon a woman was walking in.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, _____. My name is Melinda May and I\u2019m Coulson\u2019s second in command. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>You cocked an eyebrow and looked at her as if to say Are you fucking kidding me? but remained silent otherwise. Coulson just sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s been silent this whole flight. Not even a word of this 'dragon\u2019s tongue\u2019 Barnes mentioned.\u201d</p><p>That caught you off guard. They knew what language you mainly spoke but not how to speak it. You had to admit it was going to be nice to not have to speak every time someone asked you a question.</p><p>May just nodded and opened the door wider. \u201cRoss is waiting for us inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecretary or Agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent. The Secretary of State will arrive later tonight or first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Coulson looked over at Colossus and Cable. They each grabbed an arm and began to pull you through the doorway after Coulson and May, Logan bringing up the rear. You didn\u2019t bother trying to fight. With the collar and chains on you, even if you could fight off the five surrounding you there was no chance you would make it off the plane before being brought down. The five of you walked out of the room and out the back of the plane, passing by groups of people you saw on the battlefield. None of them seemed to be holding a grudge against you. Well, except the one you were assuming was Captain America. He was watching you with a measured gaze, the shield he tossed at you strapped to his back. You walked across the expansive landing strip and into an obvious government building. There a group of people was waiting to greet you, only one you recognized thanks to Hydra but you were sure they all were Avengers.</p><p>Tony Stark strolled up to you despite Coulson voicing his concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Phil. She\u2019s not going anywhere. Hey, kid. I\u2019m Tony Stark. Those are some pretty awesome wings. Mind if I take a look?\u201d</p><p>You jerked back the best you could when he slowly reached out to touch you.</p><p>He pulled his hands back and held them up in surrender. \u201cFair enough, I should have waited for the O.K. Look, the plan is to keep you here for a while to make sure you\u2019re not a threat, see what you know about Hydra, the whole 9 yards. But we\u2019re hoping maybe you\u2019d want to join our team when your time is up? Could really use someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Join the Avengers? Had he lost his ever loving mind? Clearly he was trying to trick you, but you couldn\u2019t help but be compelled to answer him.</p><p>\u201c<i>Zaldr\u012bzes buzdari iksos daor</i>.\u201d</p><p>Everyone froze and turned to stare at you. The silence was so painful and so focused on you, no one noticed the small group of agents walking over. The head of the group was a man with greying hair and dark blue eyes. He had a serious look to him and you knew he would be the one in charge of your 'stay\u2019 in this building.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here, Stark?\u201d</p><p>That seemed to snap everyone out of their trance. \u201cAgent Ross, you\u2019re just in time. Our guest actually spoke! Though Barnes was right. I have no idea what the hell language that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragon\u2019s tongue, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears to be so. But I just got word that Thor returned to the compound an hour ago. He should be flying over here any minute and maybe he\u2019ll have an idea what she\u2019s saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. In the meantime let\u2019s get her set up.\u201d</p><p>Colossus and Cable pulled you forward to follow after the group of agents, the Avengers now behind you. Except for Stark. Now that he knew you could and would speak, he was glued to your side.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal, kid? Barnes said you know over thirty different languages but you choose the one that no one else knows now that your handlers are dead? Don\u2019t you miss talking to someone?\u201d You looked over at him and frowned and raised an eyebrow. \u201cOk, fair. I\u2019m sure Hydra agents were just a barrel of laughs. But don\u2019t count us out! We got a great facility and you could start your life over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give promises you can\u2019t keep, Stark.\u201d Agent Ross warned. \u201cWe heard what happened on the battlefield and I can\u2019t see Secretary Ross just handing her over to you guys. Especially given your track record.\u201d</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes and blew a raspberry. \u201cDetails.\u201d</p><p>Your group eventually stopped in front of an all glass room and there, one more person was waiting. \u201cGood evening, ______. I\u2019m Professor Charles Xavier. I\u2019m a mutant, just like you.\u201d</p><p>Like you? Cocking an eyebrow, you twitched your wings so the chains rattled. The professor chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct, I do not have wings. My mutation has to do with my mind and for that I must apologize. I am the one who froze you at the end of the fight.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, you nodded your head in acknowledgement. That would explain why you didn\u2019t remember much after you torched Hydra.</p><p>\u201cI will be visiting you often in hopes you will open up and talk about what you had experienced. Now as a fair warning, I can read minds though I try not too without permission.\u201d</p><p>You nodded your head again and waited as the agents heaved open the heavy door to your cell. Colossus and Cable pulled you inside and then turned you to face the entrance. Coulson came up holding a set if keys.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are, Professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, _____. But we\u2019ll need to freeze you again.\u201d</p><p>This time you were kept conscious and it felt\u2026. wrong. It was like you had been pushed to the back of your own mind, losing all control.</p><p>The three men went to work removing your chains and cuffs, but leaving the collar on. Coulson gestured to the bed along one of the walls.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed is a set of clothes for you and in the corner a bathroom you can use to change in. Please place your old clothes in the sliding bin by the door. That bin will also be how you receive your food everyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery \u2018Silence of the Lambs\u2019 of you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Stark.\u201d Agent Ross glared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you guys are equipped for this any better than we are.\u201d</p><p>The three men left your cell and as the heavy door slammed home, the hold on you was released. Walking to the center of the room, you stretched your wings out first completely behind you and then fully to the sides. Your tail swished around you a few times as you walked to the bed. On the bed you could see a small pile of clothes and already you were filled with dread. No way in hell any of this would fit you and clearly they didn\u2019t trust you enough to make your own. Though in all fairness it did take at least five years and many ripped bed sheets later before Hydra finally gave in. You wondered how long it would take SHIELD.</p><p>You picked up the shirt first and frowned. It was a standard shirt which meant no way in hell would you be able to get it on with your wings still attached. At your old compound you had a small variety of strapless corsets, halter tops, and even one long sleeve shirt that you had sewn a zipper into the back and a scooped back to accommodate where your wings were located right on each side of your shoulder blades. Without another look, you tossed the shirt on the floor close to the sliding tray.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, that\u2019s standard issue. You have to wear it.\u201d</p><p>You just cocked an eyebrow at the agent and flexed your wings. Then you picked up the pants. A fine length but you could see the seem in the back wasn\u2019t meant to be pulled apart. Which meant when you did to make room for your tail, nothing would stop the pants from splitting completely. They got tossed aside as well.</p><p>Picking up the top sheet on the bed, you held the shorted side and quickly pulled with both hands. The sheet ripped perfectly down the middle thanks to all your years of practice.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Came the annoyed voice again.</p><p>You ignored him and removed your boots as requested, tossing them next to the discarding outfit. Picking up half of the bed sheet, you walked to the bathroom to change.</p><p>Well, you tried to at least. First the tops of your wings wouldn\u2019t go through the door. So you bent forward to ease them in first. But then your sides stuck out too much. Fucking hell. If the Winter Soldier told them about you why the fuck was the door too goddamn small?!</p><p>Sighing, you placed yourself in the doorway facing the bathroom and extended your wings out to offer you some cover. They would see your bare back but after the day you had, you were out of fucks to give.</p><p>Quickly you removed your old shirt and tossed it over your shoulder. There was a brief embarrassing murmur from the agents on the otherside of the glass followed by a laugh from Tony.</p><p>\u201cGuess you guys didn\u2019t plan very well. How the hell is she supposed to use the bathroom if she can\u2019t fit through the door?\u201d</p><p>You could hear Agent Ross clear his throat. \u201cUm, someone get maintenance up here on the double. We need to replace the door ASAP.\u201d</p><p>While you listened to the agents scramble, you took the sheet and began to wrap it around your torso to form a halter top, tying the two end pieces behind your back. You finally turned to face what was left of the group. Coulson and Ross were red in the face while Tony was shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNot laughing at you, kid. Just amazed the government would be this ill prepared.\u201d</p><p>You took the time to do a circle in place to get an idea for your cell. It was a decent size, giving you just enough room to expand your wings if necessary. The bathroom looked big enough but it was hard to know for sure since you couldn\u2019t fit in the door. The single size bed was bolted to one wall and when you looked up, the ceiling expanded at least twenty feet above. Fat lot of good it did, though. With this collar around your neck, it was like they just took a chain and bolted you to the ground. No super strength, so no ability to use your wings.</p><p>Better than Hydra, my ass. You thought bitterly.</p><p>You completed your circle to face the door again just as a door loudly banged opened. Tony looked over and smiled. \u201cThere you are, Point Break! Come see what we caught.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity got the better of you and you walked over to the glass wall. Into your vision walked a very tall, blonde, bearded man clad in leather armor. His hair was cut short and he had two different eye colors. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how good looking he was. But all that disappeared in the moment you noticed he was carrying an ax almost as tall as him.</p><p>You were right: SHIELD was going to kill you.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182640137018/a-dragon-is-not-a-slave\">Chapter 4</a></p>",
                "content": "<p>\n\n<b>Chapter 3: Prisoner Of War\n\n</b><br /></p><p><b>Summary:&nbsp;\n\n</b>Reader is detained and taken to the CIA headquarters. She&rsquo;s believed she&rsquo;s been brought there to die, especially when Thor shows up carrying Storm Breaker.\n\n</p><p><b>Notes:&nbsp;Continuing with my weird theme, Everybody Knows by Sigrid (The one used at the beginning of Justice League - you know, that dumpster fire of a movie? It was, fight me.) is a song I would listen to for this chapter. Especially when Reader is being shown her cell in DC.Also going to be second person from here on out. The last chapter almost was, but I decided to keep with the Spoils of War theme and have it from the view of the people on the ground.</b></p><p><b>Warnings: Explicit Language</b></p><p>You began to slowly come to, your head slightly throbbing from the sonic blast you had endured before your crash landing. You knew in a few hours it will have been like you weren&rsquo;t even in a fight. The bonus of your mutation, you were almost indestructible. Even if the collar was still on you&hellip;. </p><p>Pausing in your thought, you realized it felt like there was still a collar around your neck. But you were pretty damn sure you remembered seeing it on the ground in front of you at the end of the fight. You could feel your hands beneath your head and you slowly moved one to feel at your neck. Sure enough, the collar was back. Or was it? This one felt newer, sleaker, and cleaner for damn sure. What did happen when the fight ended? You remembered falling, seeing the collar, torching your handlers - gods that had felt good. But after that? It was kind of a blur. Almost as if your body had locked down against your will.</p><p>You moved to sit up and that&rsquo;s when you noticed you had large metal cuffs around your wrists. Attached to them was a long metal chain that met large metal cuffs at your ankles. Your wings twitched and you could hear the rattling of more chains. Clearly whomever had ended up with you wasn&rsquo;t fucking around.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for our safety.&rdquo; Came an authoritative voice.</p><p>Your head instantly snapped up to see you weren&rsquo;t alone. Sitting up, you could see you were in a metalic grey room with hexagon designs all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. You had been laying on your stomach on a very hard bed and as you sat up you almost fell over. Your tail had been bound with your wings and it was throwing off your center of balance.</p><p>In the room with you stood four men in each corner: to your right was the large, all metal mutant that had grabbed you by the tail during the fight. You knew if you stood up he would easily tower over you by a foot or two. To his right was the man who shot you in the back. He looked like a soldier, greying hair but a hard face and had a metal arm like the Winter Soldier. But you could see the metal peeking out of his collar of his shirt onto his neck and you could swear it almost looked organic. Like it had grown from his skin. Next to him was a man you had only seen glimpses of during the battle. He was good looking in a rugged sort of way, full beard, built, and a look about him like he had seen too much in his life. These three would not make for easy jailers while you had the collar on.</p><p>And the last man seemed out of place from the other three. He was in slacks and a button up with the sleeves rolled up and a bullet proof vest over that. There was a bureaucratic manner about him and it seemed odd he was one of your jailers.</p><p>&ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re finally awake,&rdquo; the suit spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Phil Coulson, Director of SHIELD. This is Logan, Cable, and Colossus of the X-Men. We&rsquo;ll be guarding you as we travel to DC. You&rsquo;ll be staying at the CIA headquarters there.&rdquo;</p><p>Ah, a director of SHIELD.

It was like you had been pushed to the back of your own mind, losing all control.</p><p>The three men went to work removing your chains and cuffs, but leaving the collar on. Coulson gestured to the bed along one of the walls.</p><p>&ldquo;On the bed is a set of clothes for you and in the corner a bathroom you can use to change in. Please place your old clothes in the sliding bin by the door. That bin will also be how you receive your food everyday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very &lsquo;Silence of the Lambs&rsquo; of you guys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me a break, Stark.&rdquo; Agent Ross glared at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you guys are equipped for this any better than we are.&rdquo;</p><p>The three men left your cell and as the heavy door slammed home, the hold on you was released. Walking to the center of the room, you stretched your wings out first completely behind you and then fully to the sides. Your tail swished around you a few times as you walked to the bed. On the bed you could see a small pile of clothes and already you were filled with dread. No way in hell any of this would fit you and clearly they didn&rsquo;t trust you enough to make your own. Though in all fairness it did take at least five years and many ripped bed sheets later before Hydra finally gave in. You wondered how long it would take SHIELD.</p><p>You picked up the shirt first and frowned. It was a standard shirt which meant no way in hell would you be able to get it on with your wings still attached. At your old compound you had a small variety of strapless corsets, halter tops, and even one long sleeve shirt that you had sewn a zipper into the back and a scooped back to accommodate where your wings were located right on each side of your shoulder blades. Without another look, you tossed the shirt on the floor close to the sliding tray.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, that&rsquo;s standard issue. You have to wear it.&rdquo;</p><p>You just cocked an eyebrow at the agent and flexed your wings. Then you picked up the pants. A fine length but you could see the seem in the back wasn&rsquo;t meant to be pulled apart. Which meant when you did to make room for your tail, nothing would stop the pants from splitting completely. They got tossed aside as well.</p><p>Picking up the top sheet on the bed, you held the shorted side and quickly pulled with both hands. The sheet ripped perfectly down the middle thanks to all your years of practice.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Came the annoyed voice again.</p><p>You ignored him and removed your boots as requested, tossing them next to the discarding outfit. Picking up half of the bed sheet, you walked to the bathroom to change.</p><p>Well, you tried to at least. First the tops of your wings wouldn&rsquo;t go through the door. So you bent forward to ease them in first. But then your sides stuck out too much. Fucking hell. If the Winter Soldier told them about you why the fuck was the door too goddamn small?!</p><p>Sighing, you placed yourself in the doorway facing the bathroom and extended your wings out to offer you some cover. They would see your bare back but after the day you had, you were out of fucks to give.</p><p>Quickly you removed your old shirt and tossed it over your shoulder. There was a brief embarrassing murmur from the agents on the otherside of the glass followed by a laugh from Tony.</p><p>&ldquo;Guess you guys didn&rsquo;t plan very well. How the hell is she supposed to use the bathroom if she can&rsquo;t fit through the door?&rdquo;</p><p>You could hear Agent Ross clear his throat. &ldquo;Um, someone get maintenance up here on the double. We need to replace the door ASAP.&rdquo;</p><p>While you listened to the agents scramble, you took the sheet and began to wrap it around your torso to form a halter top, tying the two end pieces behind your back. You finally turned to face what was left of the group. Coulson and Ross were red in the face while Tony was shaking with laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Not laughing at you, kid. Just amazed the government would be this ill prepared.&rdquo;</p><p>You took the time to do a circle in place to get an idea for your cell. It was a decent size, giving you just enough room to expand your wings if necessary. The bathroom looked big enough but it was hard to know for sure since you couldn&rsquo;t fit in the door. The single size bed was bolted to one wall and when you looked up, the ceiling expanded at least twenty feet above. Fat lot of good it did, though. With this collar around your neck, it was like they just took a chain and bolted you to the ground. No super strength, so no ability to use your wings.</p><p>Better than Hydra, my ass. You thought bitterly.</p><p>You completed your circle to face the door again just as a door loudly banged opened. Tony looked over and smiled. &ldquo;There you are, Point Break! Come see what we caught.&rdquo;</p><p>Curiosity got the better of you and you walked over to the glass wall. Into your vision walked a very tall, blonde, bearded man clad in leather armor. His hair was cut short and he had two different eye colors. You couldn&rsquo;t help but notice how good looking he was. But all that disappeared in the moment you noticed he was carrying an ax almost as tall as him.</p><p>You were right: SHIELD was going to kill you.</p><p><a href=\"https://my-marvel-musings.tumblr.com/post/182640137018/a-dragon-is-not-a-slave\">Chapter 4</a></p>",
